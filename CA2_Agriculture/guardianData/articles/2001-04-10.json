The Finnish international drove the ball in low and Gary Neville scuffed his attempted clearance only as far as Fish, who banged it joyfully home from close range. Back came United, as an Irwin cross drifted beyond Ilic and back off the angle of post and bar. When Scholes then hit the post, Charlton must have sensed they could hang on for a remarkable point. But where there is Solskjaer there is hope. Four minutes after coming on, the little Norwegian striker was lurking in the penalty area to turn in an Irwin cross. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "body": "<p>Eleven of the 12 Scottish Premier League clubs face financial ruin unless they slash their wage bills, according to a new survey. </p> <p>The accountancy firm Deloitte &amp; Touche has claimed that, with the exception of Celtic, all the clubs are spending more than 50% of turnover on players' wages, with Hibernian the worst offenders at 89%. </p> <p>However Rod Petrie, Hibernian's managing director, pointed out that the survey's use of accounts for the 1998-99 season, despite the availability of figures for 1999-2000, had helped paint a misleading picture. \"The figures for this club refer to our season in the First Division [which] inevitably saw turnover fall significantly,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Had the research looked at the accounts which were issued at our annual meeting last year, it would have become obvious that in our first season back in the SPL our wages accounted for 69% of turnover, a fall of 20%, due to the significant increase in revenues.\" </p> <p>Wage cutting has become a fact of life in the SPL over the last few months, with Hearts releasing high earners such as Gordan Petric while Motherwell, who ran up a loss of \u00a33m in the last financial year, have sold three players and released two more. \"We have just taken in \u00a32m in transfer fees,\" said the Fir Park club's chief executive Pat Nevin. \"From now on wages will constitute between 50 and 60% of turnover. We have taken the necessary steps; other clubs are doing it.\" </p> <p>Aberdeen plan to cut their wage bill from 86% to below 55%. Rangers' wages account for 58.3% of turnover, while the figure at Celtic is 46%. </p> <p>Middlesbrough's move for Szilard Nemeth, 23, has hit problems as the Inter Bratislava striker needs a work permit but has not appeared in the Slovakia team for 75% of competitive games for the past two years, as required. </p> <p>Boro, though, are hoping that, as Nemeth is a current international and has been a regular for the under-21s for three years, he may get the go-ahead. A Uefa tribunal may also have to decide a fee if agreement is not reached between the clubs as even though the player is out of contract in the summer, Slovakia is not in the European Union and his club is entitled to compensation. Nemeth is scheduled to join on July 1 but the deal is unlikely to go through if Boro are relegated. </p> <p>Kily Gonzalez will miss Valencia's European Cup quarter-final second leg against Arsenal on Tuesday due to a thigh-muscle injury sustained during Saturday's 4-1 victory over Rayo Vallecano. </p> <p>Bayern Munich's Elber is also a doubt for their second leg against Manchester United the following day after injuring his left knee against Borussia Dortmund. The team doctor drained fluid from the Brazilian striker's joint on Monday and he will not train again until Friday at best. </p> <p>A three-day disciplinary hearing into alleged financial irregularities at Chesterfield began at Hillsborough yesterday. A joint Football Association and Football League inquiry was launched in February into alleged irregularities concerning payments to players and attendance figures. </p> <p>Chesterfield are five points clear at the top of the Third Division but could face a substantial points deduction if found guilty. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "bodyText": "Eleven of the 12 Scottish Premier League clubs face financial ruin unless they slash their wage bills, according to a new survey. The accountancy firm Deloitte &amp; Touche has claimed that, with the exception of Celtic, all the clubs are spending more than 50% of turnover on players' wages, with Hibernian the worst offenders at 89%. However Rod Petrie, Hibernian's managing director, pointed out that the survey's use of accounts for the 1998-99 season, despite the availability of figures for 1999-2000, had helped paint a misleading picture. \"The figures for this club refer to our season in the First Division [which] inevitably saw turnover fall significantly,\" he said. \"Had the research looked at the accounts which were issued at our annual meeting last year, it would have become obvious that in our first season back in the SPL our wages accounted for 69% of turnover, a fall of 20%, due to the significant increase in revenues.\" Wage cutting has become a fact of life in the SPL over the last few months, with Hearts releasing high earners such as Gordan Petric while Motherwell, who ran up a loss of \u00a33m in the last financial year, have sold three players and released two more. \"We have just taken in \u00a32m in transfer fees,\" said the Fir Park club's chief executive Pat Nevin. \"From now on wages will constitute between 50 and 60% of turnover. We have taken the necessary steps; other clubs are doing it.\" Aberdeen plan to cut their wage bill from 86% to below 55%. Rangers' wages account for 58.3% of turnover, while the figure at Celtic is 46%. Middlesbrough's move for Szilard Nemeth, 23, has hit problems as the Inter Bratislava striker needs a work permit but has not appeared in the Slovakia team for 75% of competitive games for the past two years, as required. Boro, though, are hoping that, as Nemeth is a current international and has been a regular for the under-21s for three years, he may get the go-ahead. A Uefa tribunal may also have to decide a fee if agreement is not reached between the clubs as even though the player is out of contract in the summer, Slovakia is not in the European Union and his club is entitled to compensation. Nemeth is scheduled to join on July 1 but the deal is unlikely to go through if Boro are relegated. Kily Gonzalez will miss Valencia's European Cup quarter-final second leg against Arsenal on Tuesday due to a thigh-muscle injury sustained during Saturday's 4-1 victory over Rayo Vallecano. Bayern Munich's Elber is also a doubt for their second leg against Manchester United the following day after injuring his left knee against Borussia Dortmund. The team doctor drained fluid from the Brazilian striker's joint on Monday and he will not train again until Friday at best. A three-day disciplinary hearing into alleged financial irregularities at Chesterfield began at Hillsborough yesterday. A joint Football Association and Football League inquiry was launched in February into alleged irregularities concerning payments to players and attendance figures. Chesterfield are five points clear at the top of the Third Division but could face a substantial points deduction if found guilty. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "body": "<p>Supermarket group Tesco, now the biggest retailer in the UK, rang up its first \u00a31bn profit last year and yesterday claimed to be the fastest growing major retailer in the world. The 700-strong chain, once regarded as a downmarket pile-it-high-and-sell-it-cheap business, is raking in sales of nearly \u00a323bn a year and producing a profit of \u00a33m a day. </p> <p>Only one UK retailer - Marks &amp; Spencer - has ever breached the \u00a31bn barrier before, and M&amp;S has since suffered an about-turn in its fortunes. It will struggle to make \u00a3430m this year. </p> <p>Despite criticism from consumer groups and some farmers' representatives, Tesco, which now accounts for \u00a325 of every \u00a3100 spent on groceries in the UK, insisted it was not making excessive profits. Chief executive Terry Leahy said the chain was making only just over \u00a33 profit from every \u00a3100 taken at the checkout and deputy chairman David Reid said the growth had been driven by \"better service, quality and value for money\". </p> <p>The supermarket has also benefited from the lacklustre performance of some of its rivals, especially Sainsbury. Until 1995 Sainsbury was bigger than Tesco, but its last reported profits were barely half Tesco's \u00a31bn. Safeway, which made \u00a3236m last year, is turning itself into a new breed of small-scale hypermarket while Asda appears to have lost some of its momentum since its takeover by the American Wal-Mart discount chain. </p> <p>Tesco's \u00a31.05bn profit, which was generated in the year to the end of February, is 12% up on last year. Sales were up 11.9%. </p> <p>Earlier this year - in the wake of a two-year competition commission inquiry which cleared the supermarkets of making excessive profits - Tony Blair accused the supermarkets of having shoppers in \"an armlock\", but Tesco denied its profits and success were being driven by squeezing suppliers. It said it had cut prices by \u00a31bn over the past five years and that its prices were now 11% lower than in 1996. </p> <p>A spokesman for the company said: \"Our profits have been growing in line with sales for a number of years. In other words, it is not margin expansion, or any rip-off, that is driving the profit growth.\" </p> <p>\"And in as much as farmers are experi encing tough times, why blame it on the supermarkets? Other macro factors are more important.

      "bodyText": "Supermarket group Tesco, now the biggest retailer in the UK, rang up its first \u00a31bn profit last year and yesterday claimed to be the fastest growing major retailer in the world. The 700-strong chain, once regarded as a downmarket pile-it-high-and-sell-it-cheap business, is raking in sales of nearly \u00a323bn a year and producing a profit of \u00a33m a day. Only one UK retailer - Marks &amp; Spencer - has ever breached the \u00a31bn barrier before, and M&amp;S has since suffered an about-turn in its fortunes. It will struggle to make \u00a3430m this year. Despite criticism from consumer groups and some farmers' representatives, Tesco, which now accounts for \u00a325 of every \u00a3100 spent on groceries in the UK, insisted it was not making excessive profits. Chief executive Terry Leahy said the chain was making only just over \u00a33 profit from every \u00a3100 taken at the checkout and deputy chairman David Reid said the growth had been driven by \"better service, quality and value for money\". The supermarket has also benefited from the lacklustre performance of some of its rivals, especially Sainsbury. Until 1995 Sainsbury was bigger than Tesco, but its last reported profits were barely half Tesco's \u00a31bn. Safeway, which made \u00a3236m last year, is turning itself into a new breed of small-scale hypermarket while Asda appears to have lost some of its momentum since its takeover by the American Wal-Mart discount chain. Tesco's \u00a31.05bn profit, which was generated in the year to the end of February, is 12% up on last year. Sales were up 11.9%. Earlier this year - in the wake of a two-year competition commission inquiry which cleared the supermarkets of making excessive profits - Tony Blair accused the supermarkets of having shoppers in \"an armlock\", but Tesco denied its profits and success were being driven by squeezing suppliers. It said it had cut prices by \u00a31bn over the past five years and that its prices were now 11% lower than in 1996. A spokesman for the company said: \"Our profits have been growing in line with sales for a number of years. In other words, it is not margin expansion, or any rip-off, that is driving the profit growth.\" \"And in as much as farmers are experi encing tough times, why blame it on the supermarkets? Other macro factors are more important. Farm profits are extremely cyclical and in recent years the strong pound and the travails associated with BSE have been the main issues.\" But a spokeswoman for the National Consumer Protection Council said: \"It is high time Tesco cut their prices more and gave the customers more benefit from their profits\", while Michael Hart, of the Small And Family Farms Alliance accused the supermarkets of being a \"new food baronial class\". The Liberal Democrats' agriculture spokesman, Colin Breed, called for the appointment of a retail regulator \"who would not be in the pockets of the supermarkets.\" But the National Farmers' Union, while admitting that some of its members would find the earnings \"hard to comprehend\", backed the company.

She said: \"I think the way forward is to get farmers to muscle together to make a better profit for themselves, and they should look at efficiencies of operations.\" Tesco is driving its growth through international expansion, and now operates 65 hypermarkets abroad, mostly in central Europe and Asia. Sales at those stores climbed to nearly \u00a33bn last year and they produced profits of \u00a374m. At home, the group last year sold \u00a345m of DVD players and TVs, extended its clothing range and put 8,000 new non-food products on its shelves. Mr Leahy outlined plans to spend \u00a31bn opening more Tesco outlets in the UK this year.

The dramatic reduction in activity in the first quarter of this year, most dramatically illustrated by the halving in the number of mergers and acquisitions which took place in Europe compared with last year, has led to fears in the City that the recent years of record employment and bonuses cannot be repeated. One City source said: \"Most of the big banks are looking at their headcount from week to week to see what's happening in the markets.\" While none of the leading banks will admit that they are being forced to make bankers redundant, Goldman Sachs is known to be using its annual performance review to reduce its 22,000 global workforce by as much as 5%. At least 100 staff are thought to have left Goldman in recent weeks, with a handful being made redundant as recently as last week. Last night, Merrill Lynch, which failed to renew contracts of 80 staff last week, refused to comment on rumours that it had yesterday started to make full-time staff redundant. A spokesman said: \"Due to the continuing weak business environment affecting the entire industry, we continue to examine how we are allocating resources, including staffing levels and all other expenses.\"",

She has recently bought a flat with a friend, and now that the initial expenses are out of the way she thinks she can afford to start a pension. She has considered the information on stakeholder pensions, including the 'decision trees' and this helped her to decide that a stakeholder pension would be suitable for her.\" Parveen is the star of the government's guide to stakeholder pensions.</p> <p>Parveen went to work pretty fast, since stakeholder pensions were only launched by the government last Friday. So who is this model citizen, this perfect Asian gymnast who has a mortgage and a pension before the age of 30 on a very modest salary? She seems surprisingly certain about her future life. Is she perhaps a lesbian in a settled relationship with the friend who co-owns her flat? That might explain why she is quite sure she will not have children and will not need any rainy-day money, her savings untouchable until she is 65.</p> <p>Parveen is a paragon of prudence. With a mortgage on \u00a314,000 pay, (she plainly lives far from the south-east), Guardian personal finance writers, using average mortgage figures, reckon that after tax, national insurance, council tax, mortgage and energy bills, she has about \u00a36,480 a year, or \u00a3135 a week to live on. So what made her decide that a pension was right for her? Shouldn't she have put any savings into an ISA where she could get the money back if she ever gets sick, loses her job or just needs it? Did she have a financial adviser? If so she was mis-sold this pension.</p> <p>I called the Department of Social Security in whose stakeholder guide Parveen features. Would it be possible to interview her? The press officer retired to enquire and returned a bit embarrassed. \"Um, well, actually, she's just an example.\" Oh? \"She's not real\". Just as well, since a real-life Parveen might be going hungry to pay for her old age. No Parveen is just a decoy duck, displayed to entice in the real-life Parveens.</p> <p>There are, the government says, 5m sitting ducks at whom stakeholder pensions are primarily targeted. They earn between \u00a310,500 and \u00a320,000, and currently have no pensions. However, research suggests that most people on below-average earnings can't afford pensions. (A third of those who take out personal pensions default within a few years, losing most of their money). Most people who are rich enough, do save. So there is a danger that with its new high profile advertising, the government is embarking on its own pensions mis-selling campaign.</p> <p>Make no mistake, Gordon Brown's new stakeholder is a genuinely brilliant innovation. He has forced the finance industry to create far better pensions than ever existed before, in the teeth of bitter opposition. The kite-mark guarantees no charges more than 1%. It is completely flexible: you can put in vary ing sums, as much or as little as you like, free to move your funds from one company to another with no penalties. It has made a mini-revolution in the City, forcing them to obey the chancellor's determination to get a better deal, a pension easy to trust without needing to understand its small print. For the better off, it is yet another tax break, as people can pay extra tax-free sums into partners' and children's pension funds with full tax relief. As with ISAs, products designed for low earners always end up sheltering huge amounts more money of the rich into tax havens and capital gains avoidance. So stakeholders are very good for average earners and just dandy for the rich.</p> <p>B ut this is not something to sell Parveen. By 2003 the minimum income guarantee (MIG) will deliver at least \u00a3100 a week to all pensioners. Parveen cannot possibly pay enough into her pension to reach that: as a fitness trainer she is unlikely to earn much more. (The Institute for Fiscal Studies reckons she needs to pay in an unbroken 5% of her income for 49 full years before it is really worth her while). True, in 2003 the government is bringing in the pension credit which guarantees anyone with small savings can keep 60p in every \u00a31 saved, on top of their MIG. But that is only up to a maximum of \u00a313.80 a week - and losing 40p in every pound makes it pretty doubtful that low earners should save their money this way.</p> <p>Oddly, one reason the government gives for saving is that none of us can rely on the state in, say, 40 years time. Maybe we will have had decades of Tory slash and burn. Maybe no one will vote to take reasonable care of the pensioners and the steep increases made by this government will be swept away. (The MIG has already delivered five times more to the poorest one third of pensioners than if Labour had restored the earnings link for the basic pension. But the Tories refuse to commit to keeping the link between the MIG and earnings.) However by pre-empting some Tory future even worse than the Tory past, the existence of large savings by poor people will only make it easier to cut back state provision.</p> <p>Even more alarming is the long-term future of all pension funds. Current generations swelled the pot, paying in massively and inflating share prices as pension funds hoovered them up. But as baby boomers start drawing their pensions out, funds will be selling shares, pouring billions of shares onto the market and deflating share prices. Already out-dated calculations expecting high interest rates have thrown people's retirement planning awry. In other words, the pension future is uncertain. It always was and always will be for anyone trying to guess the politics and the economy 40 years ahead. The affluent can take the risk, helped by huge tax breaks making it worth their while. But any financial adviser would tell Parveen to put spare money where she can reach it or get a bigger mortgage as a safer bet. There is an interestingly different tone in the government's own somewhat gung-ho stakeholder guide, and the far more cautious note struck in the Financial Services Authority's guide, warning people to consider their personal circumstances with care - and get advice. They might add a warning never to take advice from governments of any hue.</p> <p>There is another reason why Parveen should not pay. The government says that as many people as possible should (morally? fiscally?) pay for their own retirement. But those who are low earners in their working lives, scrimping to get by with mortgages, would do well to let the state worry about their old age. The ever-widening divide between rich and poor will not narrow by taking more off below-average earners to save for a decent retirement that should - and increasingly is - being provided by the government's own good minimum income guarantee. As Labour rightly raises the MIG, it reduces the incentive of low earners to save - and that is as good a form of redistribution as any.</p> <p><b>Email</b><br><a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",

The stigma of \"teacher's pet\" is a hard one to shake off. And yet it is possible to worm your way into your boss's respect - if not affection - without coming across as a complete toady.</p> <p><strong>Stake out your prey</strong> </p> <p>First, know your target. What motivates your boss? What are his/her core values? How does he/she conduct their business and what are their interests outside the workplace?</p> <p>Try to pinpoint areas of strength in the way that he/she works, and any areas of potential weakness. What hours does he/she keep? Are they a morning person, or do they only perk up after lunch? </p> <p>Listen to the type of language they use when they speak. Are they speedy and concise? Do they reach quick decisions and keep to them, or are they slower and more cautious? Do they stop for a chat and a joke or are they more likely to indulge in discussions about staff stress levels and creche facilities?</p> <p>Business psychologists usually pinpoint four main behavioural styles in the workplace. To create rapport with any one of these types it can be important to flex your own style a little. Very few people fall into an extreme of one behavioural style and most of us are blends, but, by identifying a preferred type you can work on ways to improve your own communications with them:</p> <p><strong>The pragmatist</strong></p> <p>A linear thinker who likes step by step plans and procedures. This person likes working with fact, figures and logic. They tend to be calm and rational but are also often boring. This boss will only be impressed with thoroughly researched ideas and careful planning. They work slowly and meticulously and don't like to be rushed. Impress him/her by your own thoroughness and the fact that you are dependable and reliable. </p> <p>Be prepared to listen while he/she goes through all the dull details of any job. Never be seen to start a job you can't finish. Never skip small steps or details to get a job rushed through.</p> <p><strong>The nurturer</strong></p> <p>Another Linear thinker, but this boss is more concerned with team relationships than cold facts and figures. He/she will be thoughtful and concerned about the staff, rather than the task. The nurturer inspires a loyal team but through encouraging, rather than pushing them. Trust is an important issue in your relationship with him/her. If you screw up a job always come clean and ask for help, rather than covering-up.</p> <p>Impress this boss by allowing yourself to be coached and developed. Ask questions and bond like crazy. Show concern for other colleagues. If you are the office bitch who loves to gossip then learn to behave more hands-on touchy-feely. Be prepared to show an interest in this boss's family and home life. Share details of your own.</p> <p><strong>The entertainer</strong></p> <p>A born gut-reactor of a boss, someone who likes to be spontaneous and optimistic and who admires those qualities in his/her staff. This boss likes to talk and share a sense of humour. The main weakness of the entertainer is a lack of planning or attention to detail. Make him/her the centre of attention and always sound positive in your dialogues. </p> <p>Whingers will be given a wide berth. If you want to suck up to this boss, offer to take on some of the more boring tasks involving detail. They are big-picture, rather than linear workers, who specialise in intuition and creativity.</p> <p><strong>The driver</strong></p> <p>This boss is concise, direct and often adopts a bossy style. He/she will have little time for small talk, being task, rather than relationship-focused. He/she likes all the trappings of power and will be keen to remind staff of his/her status.</p> <p>The style of the driver is quite confrontational. Avoid being seen as an overt sycophant, though. Challenge him/her now and again to grow mutual respect. Be quick, direct and to the point yourself and avoid chat or waffle. Do your job quickly and allow for the fact that this boss will often pinch your best ideas or your share of the glory. Bite the bullet but don't be a complete doormat.</p>",

And yet it is possible to worm your way into your boss's respect - if not affection - without coming across as a complete toady. Stake out your prey First, know your target. What motivates your boss? What are his/her core values? How does he/she conduct their business and what are their interests outside the workplace? Try to pinpoint areas of strength in the way that he/she works, and any areas of potential weakness. What hours does he/she keep? Are they a morning person, or do they only perk up after lunch? Listen to the type of language they use when they speak. Are they speedy and concise? Do they reach quick decisions and keep to them, or are they slower and more cautious? Do they stop for a chat and a joke or are they more likely to indulge in discussions about staff stress levels and creche facilities? Business psychologists usually pinpoint four main behavioural styles in the workplace. To create rapport with any one of these types it can be important to flex your own style a little. Very few people fall into an extreme of one behavioural style and most of us are blends, but, by identifying a preferred type you can work on ways to improve your own communications with them: The pragmatist A linear thinker who likes step by step plans and procedures. This person likes working with fact, figures and logic. They tend to be calm and rational but are also often boring. This boss will only be impressed with thoroughly researched ideas and careful planning. They work slowly and meticulously and don't like to be rushed. Impress him/her by your own thoroughness and the fact that you are dependable and reliable. Be prepared to listen while he/she goes through all the dull details of any job. Never be seen to start a job you can't finish. Never skip small steps or details to get a job rushed through. The nurturer Another Linear thinker, but this boss is more concerned with team relationships than cold facts and figures. He/she will be thoughtful and concerned about the staff, rather than the task. The nurturer inspires a loyal team but through encouraging, rather than pushing them. Trust is an important issue in your relationship with him/her. If you screw up a job always come clean and ask for help, rather than covering-up. Impress this boss by allowing yourself to be coached and developed. Ask questions and bond like crazy. Show concern for other colleagues. If you are the office bitch who loves to gossip then learn to behave more hands-on touchy-feely. Be prepared to show an interest in this boss's family and home life. Share details of your own. The entertainer A born gut-reactor of a boss, someone who likes to be spontaneous and optimistic and who admires those qualities in his/her staff. This boss likes to talk and share a sense of humour. The main weakness of the entertainer is a lack of planning or attention to detail. Make him/her the centre of attention and always sound positive in your dialogues. Whingers will be given a wide berth. If you want to suck up to this boss, offer to take on some of the more boring tasks involving detail. They are big-picture, rather than linear workers, who specialise in intuition and creativity. The driver This boss is concise, direct and often adopts a bossy style. He/she will have little time for small talk, being task, rather than relationship-focused. He/she likes all the trappings of power and will be keen to remind staff of his/her status. The style of the driver is quite confrontational. Avoid being seen as an overt sycophant, though. Challenge him/her now and again to grow mutual respect. Be quick, direct and to the point yourself and avoid chat or waffle. Do your job quickly and allow for the fact that this boss will often pinch your best ideas or your share of the glory. Bite the bullet but don't be a complete doormat.",

      "body": "<p>He was supposed to be the last piece in the Total Football jigsaw, the striker who would score the goals invented by Johan Cruyff and Johan Neeskens, adding the final touch of glamour to the already irresistible footballing mechanism shared by Ajax and Holland in the early 70s. And who cares, now, that his arrival coincided with the beginning of Ajax's decline, or that he played on the losing side in two World Cup finals? A quarter of a century later the legend of Johnny Rep remains powerful enough to have drawn a queue of admirers to a book-signing session in London the other day. </p> <p>Those Dutchmen, and the wonderful freedom and intelligence of their play, made a powerful and lasting impression on young minds. Now 48, and the coach of a second division side in Amsterdam, Rep has been the inspiration for a suite by the Dutch free-jazz pianist Leo Cuypers and a character in a Soho-noir fiction by the English novelist Chris Petit. But his down-to-earth manner makes it clear that such tributes have not formed part of his own self-image. You would have to go a long way before you found a Dutch footballer willing to come up with aphorisms about seagulls and trawlers as a way of indicating his intellectual reach, and Rep is no exception. </p> <p>His first big match, at 19, was in the 1972 Intercontinental Cup against Independiente of Argentina. Replacing the veteran Sjaak Swart, a legend with the Amsterdam club, he scored two goals. He was in, and the following year he scored the only goal in the European Cup final against Juventus, completing Ajax's hat-trick of wins in the competition. </p> <p><strong> Essential instinct</strong><br> </p> <p> The amazing thing about that game was that, having conceded a goal early on, when Rep headed Horst Blankenburg's cross past Dino Zoff, the Italian team showed no interest in attacking. Despite the presence in their forward line of such players as Pietro Anastasi, Jose Altafini, Roberto Bettega and Franco Causio, they stayed fatally within their shells. </p> <p>\"Juventus were so frightened,\" Rep remembered. \"We were surprised. A good team but they did nothing. They seemed satisfied to lose 1-0. We were waiting for them. Come! But nothing. For the public, I'm afraid, it was a very bad game.\" </p> <p>Unlike most of his team-mates, he has not been brought up within the legendary Ajax school. Between the ages of eight and 16 he had played for Zaandam, his hometown club, yet there was no real problem of acclimatisation. \"All the teams wanted to play the same system - but at Ajax the players were better, so it was easier to play with them.\" </p> <p>At first it was hard for him to win a first-team place. Swart, after all, had scored five goals in the debut game of the great coach, Rinus Michels, a 9-3 defeat of MVV Maastricht in 1965. But Michels left in 1971 and it was his successor, George Knobel, who gave Rep his chance. He played throughout the 1972-73 European Cup campaign, in the dazzling 4-0 quarter-final victory over Bayern Munich in Amsterdam and in the home and away victories over Real Madrid in the subsequent round, but not until his decisive strike in the final did he score. </p> <p>After that triumph, however, the team began to break up. As David Winner recounts in his hugely enjoyable book Brilliant Orange, which Rep was signing in the Sportspages bookshop, Knobel foolishly held an election for the captaincy of the following season's team. When the vote went in favour of Piet Keizer, Cruyff took umbrage and accepted an offer to follow Michels to Barcelona. </p> <p>Like several of his contemporaries Rep clearly has mixed feelings about the man most identified with Dutch football of that era. \"I learnt a lot of my own play from Johan Cruyff,\" he said. \"Of course, the most important things for a footballer to have are instinct and talent. When you can play football, you don't need to learn. If you don't have the instinct, you cannot be a good player. But I learnt a lot from Cruyff. When I was 19 years old, he was my mentor. If I was a little bit too relaxed, he was always behind me, always pushing. He made a professional of me.\" </p> <p>On the other hand, while discussing the propensity of Dutch footballers to argue among themselves, he talked about the difference between Cruyff and Wim van Hanegem of Feyenoord, both midfield geniuses with an inclination to speak their mind. \"They could both be pretty extreme. But Van Hanegem is fine when you know him. Cruyff is more distant. If you get in bad with him, he'll never speak with you.\" </p> <p>Rep was 21 when he played in his first World Cup final, the traumatic defeat by West Germany in Munich in 1974. They had beaten Brazil 2-0 in a very physical semi-final, during which Rep responded to Roberto Rivelino's niggling by using his elbow, unseen by the officials. \"Today Rivelino is my friend,\" he said. \"But if we played that game today, there would be six red cards.\" And then in the final, having taken a first-minute lead with a penalty, they invited their bitterest enemies back into the game. </p> <p>Had they thought that, by beating Brazil, they had already won the World Cup? \"Yes. And our biggest mistake in the final was to score the first goal in the first minute. We thought we had the cup already. We made fun of the Germans. But we forgot to score the second goal.\" </p> <p>Still, they had a party afterwards with their conquerors. \"We drank a lot. And we hadn't been allowed to exchange shirts after the match, so I exchanged my jacket with Paul Breitner. The next day we flew home and went to see the queen and the parliament. So I met the queen in Paul Breitner's light blue jacket.\" </p> <p>In Germany, even though they had the bad luck to meet the hosts in the final, their matches had been attended by large numbers of Dutch supporters. In Argentina four years later, where they were to suffer the same ultimate fate, the atmosphere was very different. \"It was far away from home and people didn't have the money to go. We spent three weeks in a training camp in the Andes. Nobody there. We went crazy. In the first game, against Iran in Mendoza, there were 5,000 people - not many Dutch. No atmosphere. We played very badly. Against Scotland, 10,000. Again no atmosphere. Against Austria in Cordoba, maybe 15,000. </p> <p>Against West Germany, maybe 20,000. That was the difference. Later, when we played against Italy in the River Plate stadium in the semi-final, there were 80,000 - mostly Italians. Then there were 80,000 for the final, of course - but that was terrible, too. Argentina had to win. It was bizarre. Not a normal situation. There was some fear, too. A lot of people said that if we won the game, there would be a big problem afterwards.\" </p> <p>By that time Rep had left Ajax, opting like most of his team-mates for a foreign salary four or five times higher than the 100,000 guilders a year he had been earning in Holland. He had two seasons in Spain with Valencia, where he played alongside his friend and World Cup adversary Mario Kempes, and a Paraguayan No9, Carlos Diaz. \"Only one year Diaz played with us. Then he left to play his guitar. His nickname was El Lobo, the wolf, because he was also very dangerous at night. That was the best attack I played in. Better than with Cruyff and Keizer.\" But the supervision, by Heriberto Herrera, another Paraguayan, was somewhat lacking in inspiration. \"Discipline? Good. Coaching? Terrible. We never played with a ball in training. Always running. He's dead now, so I can say it.\" </p> <p>He left Valencia after a row with the president over money and moved to Corsica to join Bastia, with whom he played in a Uefa Cup campaign which took them all the way to the final, against PSV Eindhoven. Bastia lost 3-0 on aggregate but Rep recalls it was \"fantastic - the whole island was crazy for one year\". Then came four years at Saint-Etienne, playing alongside the young Michel Platini and Dominique Rocheteau in the most successful French club of its era, let down only by \"a bad defence, too old and too slow - a pity\". </p> <p>His last years as a player were spent back with Zaandam, where he finished as player-coach at the age of 41. Now he is grooming young players from the Surinamese and Moroccan communities in Almeer, a new town built 20 years ago on reclaimed land in the Ijsselmeer, where promotion to the first division would mean the club turning professional and building a proper stadium. But he enjoys watching English football - much more than Italian, which sends him to sleep - and would like to coach here. </p> <p>And at Almeer, in front of a crowd measured in hundreds, do they play Total Football? \"No, no. We like to try it. But it's only in our heads, eh?\" And in ours, too. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "body": "<p>A cross-party committee of MPs has launched an unprecedented campaign to persuade Coca-Cola's customers around the world to strongarm the global soft drinks company into backing the Kyoto protocols against global warming.</p> <p>They appealed to young customers to bombard both Coca-Cola - initially in Britain - and the White House urging the world's largest creator of greenhouse gases to fall in line with growing demands for greater restraints on pollutants.</p> <p>''We turn not to the foes of President Bush, but to his friends, those whose wise counsels have influenced the president, those whose wide pockets have sustained him,'' explained the former consumer affairs minister, Nigel Griffiths.</p> <p>The MPs are targeting Coca-Cola because it gave nearly $1m to George Bush's successful bid for the presidency last year and they want to persuade the drinks giant that it should use its ''influence'' with the US administration to abandon last month's sudden repudiation of Kyoto.</p> <p>They are also incensed that Coke has borrowed the environmentalists' slogan ''think globally, act locally'' and hope it can be persuaded to act upon it. ''We want Coke to act locally to get the president to think globally. Coca-Cola are the sole marketing partner of Harry Potter, the world's best known wizard. We want them to work their magic on the president.''</p> <p>Although they are in touch with MEPs at Strasbourg, with French Greens and with Senator Joe Lieberman - Al Gore's running mate in November - the MPs believe that Coke's marketing image as a friendly, global drink for young people makes it vulnerable to pressure from precisely that group of consumers.</p> <p>''We are encouraging every Coke drinker to email the UK vice president (of Coca Cola), Thomson Long, on tlong@eur.ko.com urging him to impress on President Bush the vital importance of ratifying the Kyoto protocol. We also urge people to email President Bush on president@whitehouse.gov.'' the MPs said.</p> <p>Tory backbenchers including Peter Bottomley, and Liberal Democrat Tom Brake have joined 30 Labour MPs in launching what they hope will turn into the global email campaign - directed at Coca-Cola's ''ear, not its wallet'' though leftwing signatories such as Alan Simpson believe that a boycott of Coca-Cola's products would also be legitimate.</p> <p>The national union of students (NUS) is also backing the campaign. Tony Blair and his ministers have signalled their dismay that Mr Bush has reversed his campaign pledge to back Kyoto, arguing that US interests are not served by it.</p> <p>But there are signs that American public opinion, surprised by the near-universal hostility of world reaction to such unilateralism, is shifting towards seeking to implement the Kyoto deal - stalled in the Hague in December - which will be discussed in Berlin in July.</p> <p>The deal would commit the US to cut carbon emissions by 7% compared with 1990 levels by 2012, difficult for a car-dependent culture whose per capita emissions are the highest in the world. The US has sought swap arrangements which would fend off carbon taxes in a low fuel price economy.</p> <p><b>Join the campaign</b><br> \u2022 Email the UK vice president of Coca Cola, Thomson Long, on <a href=\"mailto:tlong@eur.ko.com\">tlong@eur.ko.com</a><br> \u2022 Email President George Bush on <a href=\"mailto: president@whitehouse.gov\"> president@whitehouse.gov</a><br></p> <p><b>More information about the campaign</b><br> Email <a href=\"mailto:ngriffithsmp@parliament.uk\">ngriffithsmp@parliament.uk</a><br> to find out more<br></p> <p><b>Related special reports</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/bush\">George Bush's America </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics \">Guardian Unlimited Politics </a><br></p> <p><b>The issue explained</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theissues/article/0,6512,396904,00.html\">The Hague summit</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/bush/story/0,7369,471362,00.html\">10.4.2001: Opposition mounts to Bush's domestic agenda</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/globalwarming/story/0,7369,470618,00.html\">9.4.2001: New proposal to revive Kyoto treaty</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/globalwarming/story/0,7369,470533,00.html\">9.4.2001, comment: It's payback time for Kyoto</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/globalwarming/story/0,7369,469241,00.html\">6.4.2001: Greens urge boycott of US firms</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/globalwarming/story/0,7369,468260,00.html\">4.4.2001, comment: The great divide</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/globalwarming/story/0,7369,468023,00.html\">3.4.2001: 'Flood Bush' email stalls White House server </a><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/globalwarming/story/0,7369,465473,00.html\">30.3.2001, comment: Yet more broken promises</a><br></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\" http://www.unfccc.de/\" target=\"_new\">UN framework convention on climate change</a><br><a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org/~climate/climatecountdown/\" target=\"_new\">Greenpeace</a><br><a href=\" http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Climatic Research Unit</a><br><a href=\"http://www.cocacola.com/gateway.html\" target=\"_new\">Coca-Cola</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "A cross-party committee of MPs has launched an unprecedented campaign to persuade Coca-Cola's customers around the world to strongarm the global soft drinks company into backing the Kyoto protocols against global warming. They appealed to young customers to bombard both Coca-Cola - initially in Britain - and the White House urging the world's largest creator of greenhouse gases to fall in line with growing demands for greater restraints on pollutants. ''We turn not to the foes of President Bush, but to his friends, those whose wise counsels have influenced the president, those whose wide pockets have sustained him,'' explained the former consumer affairs minister, Nigel Griffiths. The MPs are targeting Coca-Cola because it gave nearly $1m to George Bush's successful bid for the presidency last year and they want to persuade the drinks giant that it should use its ''influence'' with the US administration to abandon last month's sudden repudiation of Kyoto. They are also incensed that Coke has borrowed the environmentalists' slogan ''think globally, act locally'' and hope it can be persuaded to act upon it. ''We want Coke to act locally to get the president to think globally. Coca-Cola are the sole marketing partner of Harry Potter, the world's best known wizard. We want them to work their magic on the president.'' Although they are in touch with MEPs at Strasbourg, with French Greens and with Senator Joe Lieberman - Al Gore's running mate in November - the MPs believe that Coke's marketing image as a friendly, global drink for young people makes it vulnerable to pressure from precisely that group of consumers. ''We are encouraging every Coke drinker to email the UK vice president (of Coca Cola), Thomson Long, on tlong@eur.ko.com urging him to impress on President Bush the vital importance of ratifying the Kyoto protocol. We also urge people to email President Bush on president@whitehouse.gov.'' the MPs said. Tory backbenchers including Peter Bottomley, and Liberal Democrat Tom Brake have joined 30 Labour MPs in launching what they hope will turn into the global email campaign - directed at Coca-Cola's ''ear, not its wallet'' though leftwing signatories such as Alan Simpson believe that a boycott of Coca-Cola's products would also be legitimate. The national union of students (NUS) is also backing the campaign. Tony Blair and his ministers have signalled their dismay that Mr Bush has reversed his campaign pledge to back Kyoto, arguing that US interests are not served by it. But there are signs that American public opinion, surprised by the near-universal hostility of world reaction to such unilateralism, is shifting towards seeking to implement the Kyoto deal - stalled in the Hague in December - which will be discussed in Berlin in July. The deal would commit the US to cut carbon emissions by 7% compared with 1990 levels by 2012, difficult for a car-dependent culture whose per capita emissions are the highest in the world. The US has sought swap arrangements which would fend off carbon taxes in a low fuel price economy.

After talks with the Inland Revenue, the corporation is scrapping the expenses rules that required camera crews working within five miles of any BBC office to return to base for their meal breaks. The rules resulted in the BBC TV news bulletins, particularly at lunchtime, missing several key court verdicts. Camera crews belonging to broadcast union Bectu downed tools outside the Old Bailey in the centre of London and returned to TV Centre six miles away in west London for their lunch. In an e-mail to staff, BBC director-general Greg Dyke announced the BBC had agreed with the Inland Revenue that BBC News and News Resources staff would not be taxed on meals if they worked less than five miles from their home base. BBC staff working in other areas now only need to be away for five hours - and at least five miles from their home base - for a meal claim not to be taxable. The \u00a355-a-night hotel cap has been lifted to \u00a365 and, after 8pm, staff can claim \u00a310 for dinner if they have been on duty for five hours or more and are more than five miles from their office. In addition, a separate expenses policy is to be introduced for BBC Resources staff. \"Before anyone asks, these changes do not signal the end of One BBC,\" Mr Dyke wrote in his email to staff. \"It's worth remembering we will have reduced 26 different expenses policies down to just two. \"I hope everyone accepts we've listened to the genuine concerns expressed by staff and we have changed the new policy as a result.\" The email is signed-off: \"Yours, Greg\". The work to rule began on Monday February 26. Bectu is to suspend the industrial action while it ballots members on the new proposals. The ballot will be completed within two weeks and Bectu insiders are expecting their members to accept the changes. \"We welcome these proposals from the BBC,\" said one Bectu source. \"It's just a shame it needed industrial action to get this sorted out.\" Related stories Apr 10: Dyke clamps down on awards liggers Read Dyke's memo to staff Feb 26: BBC boosts presence at Dando trial Feb 15: Expenses policy sparks BBC work to rule More BBC stories",

      "bodyText": "Four of the five trusts which run the 10 hospitals \"named and shamed\" as the filthiest in the NHS employ private contractors to clean their wards, toilets and other public areas. The five trusts now face visits from cleanliness \"hit squads\", and will be given cash handouts from the NHS of up to \u00a3750,000 each in order to bring their facilities up to scratch. Ministers have revealed that 40 NHS hospitals have failed hygiene and cleanliness inspections. They were formally labelled England's dirtiest after being classified \"red\" - meaning \"poor\" under the Department of Health's so-called \"traffic light\" system of classification. The results were seized on by unions as further evidence that the contracting out of NHS cleaning and catering services to the private sector has in many cases failed to raise or maintain standards. Paul Marks, Unison national secretary for health, said: \"The destructive impact of contracting out is still evident that many of the services named are run by private contractors.\" The government promised last year to abolish compulsory competitive tendering of NHS support services, although it has refused to stop trusts using private contractors where they think this will improve the quality. Four of the trusts, all of which were put on special measures, use the following private contractors: \u0095 Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS trust (Broadgreen Hospital) subcontracts its cleaning services to Sodexho. \u0095 Bristol Royal Infirmary, part of United Bristol Healthcare NHS trust, subcontracts to Rentokil-Initial. \u0095West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS trust (Mount Vernon Hospital, Watford Hospital), subcontracts to Medireft. \u0095 Essex Rivers Healthcare NHS trust (Essex County Hospital), subcontracts to Carillion Plc. \u0095 Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS trust (Pembury Hospital) subcontracts to Medireft. The fifth trust, The Dudley Group of Hospitals (Russells Hall Hospital, Wordsley Hospital, Corbett Hospital, Guest Hospital) uses NHS cleaning services. Of the 41 \"red\" trusts, 10 were considered so dirty or shabby that they have been put on \"special measures\", which means that special support teams will be sent in to improve facilities by autumn 2001. Ministers claim the figures show that the NHS has made a \"marked improvement\" in cleanliness and hygiene standards over the last nine months - the last inspection, in the autumn, classified 253 hospitals as \"poor\". The figures show that 280 hospitals are classified as green or \"excellent\" (compared to 162 in autumn 2000), and 367 were deemed to have yellow or \"acceptable\" standards of hygiene (298). The announcement follows hundreds of unannounced inspections carried out by patient environment action teams, made up of patient's representatives and NHS professionals. Four of the 10 hospitals are run by a single trust, The Dudley Group of Hospitals NHS trust. It blamed its classification on the shabby state of three of its sites which are converted workhouses built in Victorian times. A spokeswoman for the trust said it hoped to improve its performance from red to yellow by autumn 2001 but it would not be able to achieve excellence until 2004, when its buildings were replaced by a new, privately financed hospital. Unison staff at Dudley - including cleaning staff - have been carrying out a series of strikes since August 2000 over plans to transfer their employment from the trust to the private sector as part of the private finance initiative hospital deal. The trust said that its \"red\" autumn cleanliness classification which followed an inspection in early October was unrelated to the strikes. The government announced its clean-up initiative in the NHS plan in July 2001, when trusts were allocated a total of \u00a331m to smarten up the hospital environment.",

They will not have such a narrow focus; students will attend seminars and they will be able to learn team and management skills. There will be particular emphasis on entrepreneurial skills.\"</p> <p>He added: \"Having looked at systems overseas, we've found that it works well. The intention is to enhance the employability of those who choose this kind of PhD. Students will be equipped to enter the high income end of business and management.\"</p> <p>The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) and the universities involved have jointly funded the project on a fifty-fifty basis, and intend to do so for the next three years.</p> <p>The ten universities involved are: University of Birmingham, University of Brighton, Brunel University, Cranfield University, University of Lancaster, University of Loughborough, University of Newcastle, University of Nottingham, University of Sheffield and University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST).</p> <p>All ten have programmes due to start in September 2001, which will consist of 40% taught modules and 60% research training, which will lead to a thesis. Models include titles such as \"Business methods and enterprise skills\", \"Technology transfer and intellectual property rights\" and \"Forming high technology companies\".</p> <p>Professor Booth said the ten universities were selected \"very informally\". \"Essentially, universities which had shown an interest and had been active in this area were invited on-board. But the idea is to roll this out to as many universities as possible. We are committed to welcoming other institutions.\"</p> <p>The Education and Employment Minister Tessa Blackstone said, \"The new PhDs have been developed in response to the changes in knowledge and skills demanded of PhD graduates in a rapidly expanding worldwide market. They will be an attractive alternative for both international and home students. They draw on the highest quality examples of PhDs offered at the best American universities.</p> <p>\"The New Route PhD will not replace existing PhD courses. They provide an alternative method of learning at PhD level. I would encourage students from home and abroad to consider these new courses at some of our leading universities. We hope that these new courses will serve as a model to other universities to introduce similar PhD programmes in the future.\"</p> <p>Students are expected to complete the courses within three years.</p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.newphd.ac.uk/\" target=\"_new\">New Route Phds</a><br><a href=\"http://www.dfee.gov.uk/pns/DisplayPN.cgi?pn_id=2001_0204\" target=\"_new\">DFEE statement on New Route PhDs</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.hefce.ac.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Higher Education Funding Council for England</a></p>",

Mr Blair said that the \"New Route\" PhD was \"designed to give students from both home and abroad a competitive edge in the knowledge economy of the Twenty First Century.\" Professor Clive Booth, former Vice Chancellor of Oxford Brookes University and current Chair of the New Route PhD's steering group, said that he originally looked into the idea because so many of his overseas colleagues asked why Britain did not provide the same kind of vocational PhDs as those found in America. He said, \"The traditional PhD is an excellent training for specialised research based careers - particularly academic careers - but these New Route PhDs are being set up with the intention of broadening out our postgraduate training. They will not have such a narrow focus; students will attend seminars and they will be able to learn team and management skills. There will be particular emphasis on entrepreneurial skills.\" He added: \"Having looked at systems overseas, we've found that it works well. The intention is to enhance the employability of those who choose this kind of PhD. Students will be equipped to enter the high income end of business and management.\" The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) and the universities involved have jointly funded the project on a fifty-fifty basis, and intend to do so for the next three years. The ten universities involved are: University of Birmingham, University of Brighton, Brunel University, Cranfield University, University of Lancaster, University of Loughborough, University of Newcastle, University of Nottingham, University of Sheffield and University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST). All ten have programmes due to start in September 2001, which will consist of 40% taught modules and 60% research training, which will lead to a thesis. Models include titles such as \"Business methods and enterprise skills\", \"Technology transfer and intellectual property rights\" and \"Forming high technology companies\". Professor Booth said the ten universities were selected \"very informally\". \"Essentially, universities which had shown an interest and had been active in this area were invited on-board. But the idea is to roll this out to as many universities as possible. We are committed to welcoming other institutions.\" The Education and Employment Minister Tessa Blackstone said, \"The new PhDs have been developed in response to the changes in knowledge and skills demanded of PhD graduates in a rapidly expanding worldwide market. They will be an attractive alternative for both international and home students. They draw on the highest quality examples of PhDs offered at the best American universities. \"The New Route PhD will not replace existing PhD courses. They provide an alternative method of learning at PhD level. I would encourage students from home and abroad to consider these new courses at some of our leading universities. We hope that these new courses will serve as a model to other universities to introduce similar PhD programmes in the future.\" Students are expected to complete the courses within three years.

He was of the generation of Oxford ethologists that included Robert Hinde, Aubrey Manning and Desmond Morris, and he was in many ways the unsung hero of that golden age in the subject. The impact of his razor-sharp, quantitative, analytical mind came not from his own research publications, which were modest in number, but from the difference he made to those who worked with him as doctoral students or colleagues.</p> <p>Unusually, he was a scientist who put the development of others and of the subject as a whole ahead of his own career. All of us who worked with Mike can recall how he would take our half-baked ideas, inadequately analysed data, or the hesitant beginnings of a mathematical model, and transform them into a polished gem.</p> <p>He would listen while eating his lunch from an old biscuit tin with a wire handle, one knee up, shoulders slightly hunched, rocking back and forth with absorption, hands fanned open and palms facing each other as if to grasp the issue under discussion. He would then rush off to a tutorial or lecture. But next day one would receive a handwritten letter with the solution to the problem, some lines of algebra, embellished by an apt - and untranslated - quotation from Catullus or a comic verse made up by Mike himself to suit the occasion.</p> <p>Mike hardly ever accepted co-authorship of publications, but the acknowledgements sections of key papers published between the mid-1950s and 1980s show the breadth and depth of his influence, as do the career successes of his students. He was the kind of academic that would be pruned out in the contemporary, publish-or-perish, environment in universities. But if he had followed what is now the common practice of putting his name on all the papers of students and co-workers whom he had helped, he would have stood out as one of the most prolific ethologists of his time.</p> <p>Mike was born in Bournemouth, but spent his first six years in India, where his father worked for the Bombay Company. Subsequently, together with his younger sister, he was brought up in England by a great aunt and educated at Marlborough College before going to Wadham College, Oxford, to read mathematics. He switched to zoology after the first year and graduated in 1952. His interest in natural history, and birds in particular, had been triggered in Kashmir in 1942.</p> <p>A few years before Mike graduated, the Dutch ethologist Niko Tinbergen had moved to Oxford to set up the Animal Behaviour Group. Tinbergen is generally regarded, alongside Konrad Lorenz - with whom he shared a Nobel Prize in 1973 - as one of the founding fathers of ethology. Mike, with his interest in field biology, was naturally drawn to Tinbergen's group, and he completed his doctorate under Tinbergen on the behaviour of Arctic terns.</p> <p>Tinbergen sent Mike and a Swiss student, Esther Sager, who worked on kittiwakes, together to the Farne Islands, off the coast of Northumberland. Perhaps unsurprisingly to their peers, Mike and Esther not only both came away with D Phil theses, but, in 1954, married and were to have two children. They stayed in Oxford, where Mike was Tinbergen's right-hand man from 1956 to 1969 in the Animal Behaviour Research Group, which was funded by Nature Conservancy.</p> <p>Ethology at that time had been developing, under Tinbergen's influence, from largely observational studies of the behaviour of animals in their natural environment or in semi-natural captivity, into an experimental and quantitative discipline. Cullen's role in shaping this research agenda at Oxford was crucial: partly because of his mathematical facility - which Tinbergen almost totally lacked; but also because of his extraordinarily quick intelligence and his generosity in deploying it for the benefit of others</p> <p>Almost all the students who came through the Tinbergen group from the mid-1950s to the early 70s found their intellectual inspiration in Mike. To collaborate with him was exhilarating. Everything happened at high speed, using rapidly improvised equipment which cost nothing. Typical of his ingenuity was his method of plotting the three-dimensional coordinates of fish swimming in schools: simply photograph them in a bright shadow-casting light, and do the necessary trigonometry using the distance between each fish and its shadow.</p> <p>When Tinbergen retired in 1974 from the chair in animal behaviour, Cullen, who in 1968 had become lecturer in psychology - and a fellow of Wadham - was seen by many as his natural successor.

Ten days ago, two separate teams in New York reported that they used bone marrow stem cells to repair heart damage in rats and mice. In February, Florida University reported that stem cells from umbilical cord blood could restore brains damaged by stroke - once again in rats. A British biotech company is preparing to treat stroke-damaged victims with injections of human foetal stem cells.</p> <p>But adult bone marrow and nerve stem cells are difficult to collect. Fat is more available. Obesity in the US is reaching epidemic proportions. In 1998, American women spent $607m on liposuction operations.</p> <p>\"Fat is perhaps the ideal source. There's plenty of it. It's easy and inexpensive to obtain. It even has a secondary cosmetic benefit,\" said Marc Hedrick of the University of Los Angeles school of medicine. \"Our findings show that fat is not the tissue we once thought. Just as the industrial revolution transformed oil from trash to treasure, our research shows that unwanted human fat is actually a vigorous tissue with a tremendous potential for good.\"</p> <p>Stem cells are the agents that turn a tiny embryo into a collection of 100 trillion cells of 300 different kinds in just nine months. In January, after nearly two years of debate, parliament permitted embryo stem cells not needed for fertility treatments to be used for research into diseases.

      "bodyText": "American scientists report today that they have found a way to turn human fat into bone, muscle and cartilage for transplant surgery. The scientists took stem cells - the keys to the body's ability to renew itself - from fat supplied by liposuction, and turned them into three other types of cell, they report in the journal Tissue Engineering. Stem cells from bone marrow have already been used to treat leukaemia. Ten days ago, two separate teams in New York reported that they used bone marrow stem cells to repair heart damage in rats and mice. In February, Florida University reported that stem cells from umbilical cord blood could restore brains damaged by stroke - once again in rats. A British biotech company is preparing to treat stroke-damaged victims with injections of human foetal stem cells. But adult bone marrow and nerve stem cells are difficult to collect. Fat is more available. Obesity in the US is reaching epidemic proportions. In 1998, American women spent $607m on liposuction operations. \"Fat is perhaps the ideal source. There's plenty of it. It's easy and inexpensive to obtain. It even has a secondary cosmetic benefit,\" said Marc Hedrick of the University of Los Angeles school of medicine. \"Our findings show that fat is not the tissue we once thought. Just as the industrial revolution transformed oil from trash to treasure, our research shows that unwanted human fat is actually a vigorous tissue with a tremendous potential for good.\" Stem cells are the agents that turn a tiny embryo into a collection of 100 trillion cells of 300 different kinds in just nine months. In January, after nearly two years of debate, parliament permitted embryo stem cells not needed for fertility treatments to be used for research into diseases. But campaigners said that embryo research might not be necessary. They argued that stem cells harvested from adults might be used to reverse neurodegenative diseases and eventually treat heart conditions and other illnesses. The catch is to learn how to \"reprogramme\" an adult stem cell to become something else. \"Stem cells are like little kids who, when they grow up, can enter a variety of professions,\" Dr Hedrick said. \"A child might become a fireman, a doctor or a plumber, depending on the influences in their life - or environment.

These were driven by the growth of new social movements: grass-roots trade union radicalism accompanied the rise of feminist, gay, anti-war and anti-racist politics. </p> <p>Long gone from the cutting edge of university life, the radical sociologist was replaced by the poststructuralist literary scholar. Stuart Hall remains one of the few trail-blazers from that time still able to inspire a broader public. </p> <p>Past intellectual vanguards such as the Conference of Socialist Economists persist to this day, but have lost their influence. The radical thinking of recent years is different. Its concern is with language, sexuality, the stories we can tell about ourselves. </p> <p>For its critics, these new directions renounce the importance of preserving some kind of common discourse and response to corporate structures of global dominance and inequality. For its advocates, they suggest new ways of thinking about ourselves, and therefore new ways of challenging conventional frameworks that repress and constrain us. Yet whatever our theoretical framework, it is not primarily the exposition or rejection of universal aims which determines the role intellectuals play in revitalising cultural life. </p> <p>Over the past decade it is true that fewer alliances have been forged between students or academics and the remains of the new social movements. Nor have the universities been seedbeds of anti-globalisation protests. </p> <p>But then scholarly work, institutionally, has always tended towards conceptual conformity. It is specific conjunctions, rather than the precision of our theories, which promote greater interchange between academic life and the wider world. It was HIV/Aids and increased homophobia that added passion to gay and lesbian politics, promoting the advent of Queer theorising in the 1990s. It is the existence of significant cultural networks, and our desire to sustain them, which is crucial to the impact of intellectual work. </p> <p>After a decade and more of student hardship and bureaucratic prescriptions in higher education, neither staff nor students share much of that radical spirit which once nourished collective desires. Yet our governing elite now wants us to devote more time to \"community building\" (around family life, neighbourhood and church) to counter the decline of collectivity, which its own incessant imposition of managerialism and market imitation have furthered. </p> <p>Now that so many of us spend ever-longer hours in the workplace, it's a good time to rethink the role of intellectuals. We could begin by fostering more collectivity through encouraging as much controversy as we possibly can - from resisting the auditing of every move we make to the questioning of overly instrumental notions of learning at the expense of critical thought. Then indeed we might have something to offer in the schoolrooms. </p> <p>Lynne Segal is Anniversary Professor of Psychology and Gender Studies at Birkbeck College, London University.</p>",

These were driven by the growth of new social movements: grass-roots trade union radicalism accompanied the rise of feminist, gay, anti-war and anti-racist politics. Long gone from the cutting edge of university life, the radical sociologist was replaced by the poststructuralist literary scholar. Stuart Hall remains one of the few trail-blazers from that time still able to inspire a broader public. Past intellectual vanguards such as the Conference of Socialist Economists persist to this day, but have lost their influence. The radical thinking of recent years is different. Its concern is with language, sexuality, the stories we can tell about ourselves. For its critics, these new directions renounce the importance of preserving some kind of common discourse and response to corporate structures of global dominance and inequality. For its advocates, they suggest new ways of thinking about ourselves, and therefore new ways of challenging conventional frameworks that repress and constrain us. Yet whatever our theoretical framework, it is not primarily the exposition or rejection of universal aims which determines the role intellectuals play in revitalising cultural life. Over the past decade it is true that fewer alliances have been forged between students or academics and the remains of the new social movements. Nor have the universities been seedbeds of anti-globalisation protests. But then scholarly work, institutionally, has always tended towards conceptual conformity. It is specific conjunctions, rather than the precision of our theories, which promote greater interchange between academic life and the wider world. It was HIV/Aids and increased homophobia that added passion to gay and lesbian politics, promoting the advent of Queer theorising in the 1990s. It is the existence of significant cultural networks, and our desire to sustain them, which is crucial to the impact of intellectual work. After a decade and more of student hardship and bureaucratic prescriptions in higher education, neither staff nor students share much of that radical spirit which once nourished collective desires. Yet our governing elite now wants us to devote more time to \"community building\" (around family life, neighbourhood and church) to counter the decline of collectivity, which its own incessant imposition of managerialism and market imitation have furthered. Now that so many of us spend ever-longer hours in the workplace, it's a good time to rethink the role of intellectuals. We could begin by fostering more collectivity through encouraging as much controversy as we possibly can - from resisting the auditing of every move we make to the questioning of overly instrumental notions of learning at the expense of critical thought. Then indeed we might have something to offer in the schoolrooms. Lynne Segal is Anniversary Professor of Psychology and Gender Studies at Birkbeck College, London University.",

      "body": "<p>Visitors to Scarborough with an eye for the incongruous are never disappointed. The past week has been no exception, as the dogwalking refugees from foot and mouth have mingled along the prom with zealous thespians, both battling against the whiplash rain and grey of the North Sea. It's that time of year when the National Student Drama Festival descends on the overblown Victorian splendour of the old spa with its vistas of the sweeping bay. But the cold and wet has done nothing to cool the passion of the occasion. At a time when student drama is thriving, the festival seems to be serving a new role in which experimentation is to the fore. At Scarborough a climate of creative risk-taking survives as it does not at arts festivals such as the Edinburgh Fringe, where the commercial imperative is increasingly powerful. </p> <p>The number of people attending this year is at an all-time high - it has doubled in the past two or three years, while the number of plays entered for the festival has increased to 117. As well as performing arts students, it draws in both school productions and university shows by law students or scientists who dabble in acting. </p> <p>Scarborough works on a very different basis from Edinburgh. Devotees pay for the whole week and follow the tradition of seeing every show. Among the 15 shows selected this year there are no classics, no big, familiar titles. </p> <p>Students can attend many of the 150 workshops and masterclasses offered. They can also listen to Michael Attenborough, principal associate director of the Royal Shakespeare Company, expounding the moral imperative of rich, expressive language, or listen to composers Alain Boublil and Michel Schonberg of Les Miserables and Miss Saigon fame taking them through the angst of making big music. </p> <p>But they themselves are fired to devise their own pieces, paring everything down to the conceptual bone. As student theatre thrives there is a new interest in work with visual and physical impact rather than scripted pieces with conventional narrative. Today's students are interested in Shakespeare - Attenborough's workshops have been vastly oversubscribed - but their concern is to play with the text and the characters rather than pursue faithful interpretation. </p> <p>Greats who found their voice at the festival include Caryl Churchill, Tim Piggot-Smith, Dennis Potter, Alan Yentob, Stephen Fry and John Godber. Timothy West, who was there at the very beginning in 1956, says: \"Since that time how many people have used this unique national event to perform, learn, listen, drink, criticise and argue? It would be an awesome total, and include many of our leading performers, writers, producers, directors, designers and technicians. Scarborough in April is the place to be.\" </p> <p>Kieran Balfe, head of drama at Hitchin Girls School, has attended the festival for the last 20 years, first as a Hull University drama student, later on bringing school parties. He remembers Godber, then a school teacher, putting on a production with his students from Minsthorpe High School in Pontefract before going on to found Hull Truck. \"I bring students to see a range of theatre they wouldn't have the chance to see anywhere else like physical theatre,\" he says. \"It's also great for them to see how it's assessed and debated.\" </p> <p>Every lunchtime a discussion is timetabled during which each play is opened to the floor for criticism. Although this is intended to be constructive, the session is notorious for its crushed egos and occasional bouts of vitriol. </p> <p>The festival also prides itself on its irreverence. In 1969 Prince Charles became the most distinguished actor to enter a production for the festival but was not selected. In 1970 rebelliousness prevailed, and students decided they wanted more say in the way the festival was run. A meeting was held, chaired by Jack Straw, the current home secretary, and a National Union of Students party was set up to advise on festival policy. Anti-establishment feelings were running so high that year that when Sir Laurence Olivier paid a visit to see Joan Plowright, his wife, who was taking workshops, and attended a production, students occupied his seat during the interval and the company started the second half early. Olivier sat on the auditorium steps to watch the rest of the performance. The next year it was decreed that all plays must be original and no prizes were to be awarded for productions. </p> <p>These days the festival is less politically charged - the prizes have come back and the student-elected working party was disbanded long ago. But there is a desire among students to create a new order of performance. </p> <p>Dominic Leclerc, 21, an English and drama undergraduate at Warwick University, is thought to be a bright new talent. He won a director's award last year for the play Insomnia, a physical and multi-media work looking at sleep and wakefulness. This year he has returned with two shows: Dystopia, a physical dance creation employing masks and poetry and Witness Me, a slow piece of body art. \"There is a surge of interest in devised experimental, physical stuff,\" he says. \"Devised is a dirty word in the wider world, but this festival is encouraging students to take risks, pushing boundaries, mixing genres. Risk-taking at the Edinburgh Fringe has become more dangerous, because you can so easily sink, but you can do it here. There is mood of real excitement because students feel there is genuine support for new ideas. It has guts, it's a very brave festival.\" </p> <p>Some of the excitement has been engendered by the appointment of a new artistic director. At 48 Nick Stimson has taken over from Clive Wolfe, who has retired after running the festival for the last 30 years. Stimson is no stranger to young people's theatre - he taught drama in schools and university, worked with young offenders with the youth theatre at the Young Vic. </p> <p>He is particularly keen to promote the raw young energy that characterises the festival, which he refers to as one of the nation's \"best-kept secrets\". One of his ambitions is to find the funding to move some of the NSDF productions on to other venues and festivals elsewhere in the country as a way of promoting its mission.\"It's not and should not be a choreographed event,\" he says. \"It's about giving new voices a chance to find their way. It's as educational as it is artistic. I am interested in allowing young people the opportunity and providing the environment in which they can develop their ideas.\" </p> <p>This is not about virtuoso performances, or even about honing performance skills. It is notable that the drama schools are largely absent from the list of show entries or even from groups of students who attend. According to Stimson it has to be about exploring expression. </p> <p>\"We are seeing fewer and fewer classics,\" he points out. \"We did see one Shakespeare this year, and it nearly got in, but on the whole it's not there. You won't be seeing the Chekhovs. Students want to invent their own productions and that can be dangerous, but I want dangerous things to happen. That's the way to learn. It's the only opportunity in the country for students to say exactly what they want to say in performance. This event can be literally life-changing. It's such an intense experience. That's the beauty of it.\" </p> <p>Vince Nappo, 22, is a member of the Highlighters Travelling Theatre Troop from Stamford University in the States, which has sought out the festival for its play The Grandmother Project, about a girl's relationship with her grandmother. Last year, while at the Welsh College of Music and Drama, he was in a production at Scarborough called Silence. </p> <p>In the US, he says, there are no such opportunities for experimental student drama in the US: \"We don't have access to this many quality practitioners in workshops, nothing with the same forum for feedback, for real criticism from such a wide variety of people. You get the sense that theatre here is a living thing, not a relic in which you always have to do Shakespeare.\" </p> <p>Michael Attenborough first came to the festival as a Sussex University student in 1970 and is still excited about the possibilities it offers to each new generation.\"This generation of young people are wanting to express theatre in a way unique to them,\" he says. \"They are hungry for self-expression. As you get older I think you are happy to express yourself through other people's voices. </p> <p>\"I did wonder if I would get any interest in a Shakespeare workshop. Well they are interested, very much so, and they are listening very hard. But they also want to connect with it in their own way. </p> <p>\"As a student you have that last moment before you enter a competitive world and I think students are turning more and more to performing arts. In a world where computers and email are becoming the predominant communication, I think young people are also looking for a much more direct, physical form of expression.\" </p> <p>The drama festival, sponsored by the Sunday Times, continues until tomorrow.</p>",

You get the sense that theatre here is a living thing, not a relic in which you always have to do Shakespeare.\" Michael Attenborough first came to the festival as a Sussex University student in 1970 and is still excited about the possibilities it offers to each new generation.\"This generation of young people are wanting to express theatre in a way unique to them,\" he says. \"They are hungry for self-expression. As you get older I think you are happy to express yourself through other people's voices. \"I did wonder if I would get any interest in a Shakespeare workshop. Well they are interested, very much so, and they are listening very hard. But they also want to connect with it in their own way. \"As a student you have that last moment before you enter a competitive world and I think students are turning more and more to performing arts. In a world where computers and email are becoming the predominant communication, I think young people are also looking for a much more direct, physical form of expression.\" The drama festival, sponsored by the Sunday Times, continues until tomorrow.",

      "body": "<p>Just a few minutes in WH Smith provides the basic picture. The shelves in the education department are dominated by test books and revision guides: not simply for A-levels and GCSEs as you might expect, but for another type of exam, one that yields no qualification, whose results have no immediate bearing on opportunities later in a child's life, and which are of no interest to employers, yet are taken seriously enough to have visibly expanded the market for the literature of cramming. </p> <p>The exams in question are the National Tests - or Sats as they are still widely known - particularly those taken towards the end of key stage 2. Next month most of the nation's year 6 children will sit them in the \"core\" national curriculum subjects of English, maths and science. </p> <p>What makes them so important? For primary schools, and especially their heads, this has always been easy to see: to paraphrase a legendary baked beans commercial, bad Sats meanz bad league table showing meanz bad local reputation meanz school is in a hole. That is why in classrooms up and down the land, 10- and 11-year-olds are being coached by their teachers to help their school meet those coveted performance targets: a fat percentage of pupils at level 4 or better; strive, strive, strive to reach that level 5; groom those little stars to shoot to level 6. </p> <p>But the reasons why parents are becoming increasingly preoccupied with adding their own push to their children's KS2 test preparations are not quite as clear-cut. There is, after all, nothing very bankable in it for them or their offspring. No certificates are issued and results arrive too late to influence secondary school entrance. Yet somebody is buying all those cheery revision texts, and quite a lot of somebodies account for the figure of over 600,000 online hits a week on the BBC's KS2 ReviseWise website during the run-up to last May's National Tests. </p> <p>ReviseWise TV programmes for KS2 pupils are now showing as part of BBC2's Learning Zone service between 3am and 5am. Mums and dads can set their video timers and earnestly promote the programmes a little later as rivals to the delights of Cartoon Network. The BBC also offers its own range of software, videos, \"quiz books\" and even last year's test papers as listed in its brochure, A Parents' Guide to Key Stage 2 Revision, of which 800,000 copies were dis tributed via primary schools last year. </p> <p>Clearly National Test revision is a commercial concern. But what is signified by this explosion of demand and supply? An invigorated culture of educational achievement reaching into the home? Or disturbing evidence that tests which are ostensibly merely a means of measuring attainment against a uniform scale have become an obsession for many parents? </p> <p>For some these are simple matters of good parenting and human nature. Roger Croft, a father of two and financial consultant from Nottinghamshire, expresses this sentiment with a mixture of fortitude and resignation. \"The reality is you have to do all you can to help your children to succeed. It's beside the point that these tests don't get you very much that you can put your finger on. The hard fact is that they exist and your kids know it. What's more, they'll know what score they've got and what scores all their mates have got. At that age they've already figured out that life can be a race, and just like anybody else they don't want to come last.\" </p> <p>To this end Croft has encouraged his oldest child, Owain, aged 10, to polish his performance for the testing time to come. Owain says that he mostly enjoys it: \"I'm not that keen on the books cos it's a bit like extra homework, though I suppose I'm used to that. The BBC website is more fun, because it's all on the computer. I haven't seen any of those Learning Zone programmes yet. Don't tell dad!\" </p> <p>Owain attends a primary school that prides itself on its test scores, striving to improve them year by year. Other schools - probably a majority - take a more low-key approach, in part to foster a similar outlook among pupils and, hopefully, their parents. </p> <p>Amanda Bell from Adlington near Macclesfield pays tribute to the approach of the school her year 6 daughter, Harriet, attends, Adlington Primary. \"The head, David Hudson, sees that the school deals with the Sats very responsibly,\" she says. \"That's helped Harriet not to get her knickers in a twist about them. She knows she's meant to do her best work on the day, but she also knows it's not the end of the world if she doesn't.\" </p> <p>Harriet is hoping for level 5s but has kept the issue in perspective: \"I'm quite confident, though I won't be disappointed if I don't get them as long as I feel I've done my best.\" Although her mother shares her hopes, she has not augmented the school's preparation programme with one of her own. \"If, like me, you have a good relationship with the school, you've already got a good idea of how your child is doing. They do other tests as well, and children's performance is monitored so carefully these days. But because Sats results are made public it's easy for some parents to think they're more important than they really are.\" </p> <p>All very true. It is, though, also true that enlisting parents in the National Test collective effort can be of benefit to schools where morale is low. At Morningside primary in Hackney, north-east London, feelings about the tests are ambivalent - the more so in light of the school's turbulent recent past. Not long after Labour got elected, David Blunkett took what many saw as the self-serving decision to \"name and shame\" a list of \"failing\" schools, Morningside among them. Headteacher Jean Millham, then only recently installed to sort out the school's problems, publicly criticised the secretary of state for making them still harder to solve in one of the most socially deprived areas in London. </p> <p>Despite Blunkett's intervention, Morningside is a far happier school now, as shown by the enthusiasm of one of its pupils, 11 year-old Anne Olayinka. She's deep in preparation for her National Tests, but bubbling, not drowning: \"They're giving us crib sheets and practice tests and lots and lots of homework. I am nervous about the tests but I'm excited as well. I'm hoping I can get at least two level 5s.\" </p> <p>Jean Millham is the first to point out that test results are one of the least accurate measures of the quality of a school, but doesn't doubt that lifting them up from their formerly disastrous levels has been significant in mobilising the vital support of parents. </p> <p>Morningside parent Cath Eames has three children, the youngest of whom is still at the primary. While disliking the stigma the tests have visited upon the school, she welcomes their part in cranking up standards. And while she knows that a different component of Morningside's improvement strategy was responsible for spotting that her second child was having difficulty with reading, she feels sure that the later prospect of the test helped to motivate him. He was delighted by the idea of reaching level 5 and thrilled when he achieved it: \"He was very shy and in his shell before,\" says Cath, \"and having the test to aim for helped to concentrate his mind. He's much more confident now. The test was very important for him, and that's the reason why it was important for me, too.\"</p>",

The exams in question are the National Tests - or Sats as they are still widely known - particularly those taken towards the end of key stage 2. Next month most of the nation's year 6 children will sit them in the \"core\" national curriculum subjects of English, maths and science. What makes them so important? For primary schools, and especially their heads, this has always been easy to see: to paraphrase a legendary baked beans commercial, bad Sats meanz bad league table showing meanz bad local reputation meanz school is in a hole. That is why in classrooms up and down the land, 10- and 11-year-olds are being coached by their teachers to help their school meet those coveted performance targets: a fat percentage of pupils at level 4 or better; strive, strive, strive to reach that level 5; groom those little stars to shoot to level 6. But the reasons why parents are becoming increasingly preoccupied with adding their own push to their children's KS2 test preparations are not quite as clear-cut. There is, after all, nothing very bankable in it for them or their offspring. No certificates are issued and results arrive too late to influence secondary school entrance. Yet somebody is buying all those cheery revision texts, and quite a lot of somebodies account for the figure of over 600,000 online hits a week on the BBC's KS2 ReviseWise website during the run-up to last May's National Tests. ReviseWise TV programmes for KS2 pupils are now showing as part of BBC2's Learning Zone service between 3am and 5am. Mums and dads can set their video timers and earnestly promote the programmes a little later as rivals to the delights of Cartoon Network. The BBC also offers its own range of software, videos, \"quiz books\" and even last year's test papers as listed in its brochure, A Parents' Guide to Key Stage 2 Revision, of which 800,000 copies were dis tributed via primary schools last year. Clearly National Test revision is a commercial concern. But what is signified by this explosion of demand and supply? An invigorated culture of educational achievement reaching into the home? Or disturbing evidence that tests which are ostensibly merely a means of measuring attainment against a uniform scale have become an obsession for many parents? For some these are simple matters of good parenting and human nature. Roger Croft, a father of two and financial consultant from Nottinghamshire, expresses this sentiment with a mixture of fortitude and resignation. \"The reality is you have to do all you can to help your children to succeed. It's beside the point that these tests don't get you very much that you can put your finger on. The hard fact is that they exist and your kids know it. What's more, they'll know what score they've got and what scores all their mates have got. At that age they've already figured out that life can be a race, and just like anybody else they don't want to come last.\" To this end Croft has encouraged his oldest child, Owain, aged 10, to polish his performance for the testing time to come. Owain says that he mostly enjoys it: \"I'm not that keen on the books cos it's a bit like extra homework, though I suppose I'm used to that. The BBC website is more fun, because it's all on the computer. I haven't seen any of those Learning Zone programmes yet. Don't tell dad!\" Owain attends a primary school that prides itself on its test scores, striving to improve them year by year. Other schools - probably a majority - take a more low-key approach, in part to foster a similar outlook among pupils and, hopefully, their parents. Amanda Bell from Adlington near Macclesfield pays tribute to the approach of the school her year 6 daughter, Harriet, attends, Adlington Primary. \"The head, David Hudson, sees that the school deals with the Sats very responsibly,\" she says. \"That's helped Harriet not to get her knickers in a twist about them. She knows she's meant to do her best work on the day, but she also knows it's not the end of the world if she doesn't.\" Harriet is hoping for level 5s but has kept the issue in perspective: \"I'm quite confident, though I won't be disappointed if I don't get them as long as I feel I've done my best.\" Although her mother shares her hopes, she has not augmented the school's preparation programme with one of her own. \"If, like me, you have a good relationship with the school, you've already got a good idea of how your child is doing. They do other tests as well, and children's performance is monitored so carefully these days. But because Sats results are made public it's easy for some parents to think they're more important than they really are.\" All very true. It is, though, also true that enlisting parents in the National Test collective effort can be of benefit to schools where morale is low. At Morningside primary in Hackney, north-east London, feelings about the tests are ambivalent - the more so in light of the school's turbulent recent past. Not long after Labour got elected, David Blunkett took what many saw as the self-serving decision to \"name and shame\" a list of \"failing\" schools, Morningside among them. Headteacher Jean Millham, then only recently installed to sort out the school's problems, publicly criticised the secretary of state for making them still harder to solve in one of the most socially deprived areas in London. Despite Blunkett's intervention, Morningside is a far happier school now, as shown by the enthusiasm of one of its pupils, 11 year-old Anne Olayinka. She's deep in preparation for her National Tests, but bubbling, not drowning: \"They're giving us crib sheets and practice tests and lots and lots of homework. I am nervous about the tests but I'm excited as well. I'm hoping I can get at least two level 5s.\" Jean Millham is the first to point out that test results are one of the least accurate measures of the quality of a school, but doesn't doubt that lifting them up from their formerly disastrous levels has been significant in mobilising the vital support of parents. Morningside parent Cath Eames has three children, the youngest of whom is still at the primary. While disliking the stigma the tests have visited upon the school, she welcomes their part in cranking up standards. And while she knows that a different component of Morningside's improvement strategy was responsible for spotting that her second child was having difficulty with reading, she feels sure that the later prospect of the test helped to motivate him. He was delighted by the idea of reaching level 5 and thrilled when he achieved it: \"He was very shy and in his shell before,\" says Cath, \"and having the test to aim for helped to concentrate his mind. He's much more confident now. The test was very important for him, and that's the reason why it was important for me, too.\"",

Siblings get priority, and as it's a foundation school they also select up to 35% of its intake by entrance exam and 10% by proficiency in music. </p> <p>\"Then it's whoever lives the nearest. Tony took the entrance exam but obviously didn't do well enough, and there are so many siblings applying that even families living closer than us haven't been offered a place. It's frustrating, because we don't know how close Tony came in his exam, and we won't know where we are on the waiting list until the end of April. Our second choice was another foundation school a few miles away where they interview the pupils and pick the ones they want. I've written to David Blunkett saying I find it incredible that a school can choose its pupils in that way when it's supposed to be the other way round. </p> <p>\"We have been offered another school, a county comprehensive that's working hard to improve, but why should my child have to go on a long bus ride every day to a school that's not as good as any of the ones we wanted? We're hoping an acceptable place will eventually come up, and we'll go to appeal if we have to. But we're also thinking of moving, probably down to the Swindon area, where Christine's family comes from.

They live in inner London with their three children, Duy, 17, Hoa, 14, and Thanh, 11. </strong> </p> <p> When Thanh arrived from Vietnam as a refugee seven years ago he spoke no English, but has thrived in his cosmopolitan, inner-London primary school. He is also a keen musician, specialising in the oboe. Sadly, secondary provision in his home borough is uneven and Thanh lives too far from his first-choice school, an over-subscribed mixed county comprehensive, to have been offered a place there. Instead, he's been allotted to a boys' school nearer his home. Thanh's parents do not speak English well, which is why he must speak for himself. </p> <p>\"I want to go to the mixed school because I know it is a good school, especially for a musician. I was very upset when I didn't get a place there. </p> <p>\"I have an older brother who finished at the boys' school last year. He did well in his GCSEs and had some friends, but he was bullied. Because of that I am frightened. We have decided to appeal, and my teachers are helping all they can. They are going to fill in all the forms and someone is going to write a letter for us, explaining all the reasons why my parents think I should go to the school I like. If we don't win the appeal we hope for a place at our second-choice school where the waiting list is shorter. It is not a very good school, but it is still better for me than the boys' school. We don't know what else to do, so if the boys' school is the only one where I can get a place I will have to go there. We don't want to make a fuss.\" <br><strong> DG</strong> </p> <p><strong> The Worralls </strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> David Worrall is a plastics manufacturer. His wife, Lorraine, is a clerk at Asda. They live in Halifax with their three children, Lee, 13, Jamie, 11 and Katie, six.</strong> </p> <p> Lorraine and David spent ages leafing through school details, sports facilities and exam results before filling in their first three choices for Jamie, 11 in June and due to move up to high school next September. But when the buff envelope came back from Calderdale council this month, it was like a Lottery scratchcard gone wrong. </p> <p>Four schools were offered, but not one of them was from the Worralls' own list. The couple were astonished, especially as one of the comprehensives was 12 miles away from their home in Halifax - almost in a different county. </p> <p>The other three were more predictable: schools that Calderdale is trying to rescue from the bottom of its strangely assorted heap. For sad historical reasons, the Yorkshire council has a mixture of grammars, former grant-maintained schools, strongly neighbourhood comps in outlying towns and what amount to secondary moderns, although everyone is trying to raise their game. </p> <p>The squeeze on parental choice is such that the Worralls' ace - a sibling already at their first-choice school for Jamie - has been trumped. Their elder son Lee is 13 and flourishing at Holy Trinity, but the CofE high school had 242 applications for 180 places. Lorraine can do the sums. But she and David are also counting on strength in numbers. \"There are five children in Jamie's class at the primary who now haven't got schools to go to - who'll be staying behind when the others go off for the transition day at Holy Trinity or the other high schools,\" she says. Parents have been galvanised to tackle the appeals system, which involved writing three initial letters, fast. </p> <p>First, Lorraine politely turned down the four Calderdale offers, in spite of approaches from one of the schools, which she knows from living nearby in the past. She says: \"They said, 'don't worry Lorraine, Jamie will be in an express class' [part of reforms to attract back motivated parents and groom promising students]. But I don't want him segregated like that. We're a normal family and he's a normal boy who's bright enough but doesn't want 'expressing'. At that school, I'm scared that he'd either be segregated and maybe picked on, or dragged down with the rest - which is why we moved away from there.\" </p> <p>The second letter went off to Wakefield diocese to get an appeal form, and the third was the form itself, sent to Holy Trinity, which runs its own appeals; the Worralls are expecting a date at the end of this month. Lorraine and David kept their case simple and direct. \"We had to,\" says Lorraine. \"There wasn't that much room.\" </p> <p>Lee's place at the school was one point; the other a strong and honest case for the family as active Church of England parents. In the squeeze on Holy Trinity, this is a key area of point-scoring; the family's initial application, refereed by their vicar whose own son is in Jamie's class and going to Holy Trinity, had to specify between types of churchgoing (the child alone, with family etc). </p> <p>The Worralls want to go every week, and Jamie does Bible class on Monday evenings; but David's continental shifts at work rule out a lot of Sunday mornings for him, and then there's football. Lorraine says: \"Jamie and Lee are really keen, but team practice is on Sunday morning at the same time as church.\" Like so many parents of three children (six- year-old Katie has all this to come) she is torn all ways. </p> <p>That's another of her appeal points; sending Jamie somewhere else will mean that two hard-working parents have children at three separate schools - \"but I pride myself on having a very close family, and the children would benefit from being at the same school.\" She has tentatively approached the vicar about midweek worship, but it isn't yet a runner. </p> <p>So all eyes are back on the letterbox at the family's home in Pellon, Halifax, waiting for the appeals appointment to drop through. Meanwhile, the Worralls draw strength from neighbours with the same problem, and sympathetic primary teachers who warn: \"It's just never been this difficult before.\" <br><strong> MW</strong> </p> <p><strong> The Gilletts </strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Gary Gillett is a nurse. His wife, Jill, is a teacher. They live in Withington, south Manchester with their son Jack, 11 and Georgia, eight.</strong> </p> <p> Jack Gillett's parents got him into nursery school in Withington at the age of four, with cast-iron guarantees that he would \"feed\" into Parrs Wood high school eight years later. </p> <p>But the cast iron has shattered. The letter from the local education authority turned Jack down for the highly rated comprehensive in Didsbury and offered him more distant schools or ones with a struggling - at best - reputation. </p> <p>The shock is palpable in the voice of his mother, Jill, in spite of her long personal experience of the LEA and its workings. Now teaching at a special school in a Manchester education action zone (she is strongly committed to state education), she used to be in charge of transition arrangements to high schools in north Manchester. </p> <p>\"You do feel desperate, especially when everything has pointed to Parrs Wood for so long,\" she says. The family moved to be near one of the comprehensive's official feeder primaries, St Paul's, when Jack was tiny. Every assumption has been Parrs Wood. </p> <p>\"Jack plays his trombone in the orchestra there, he's done sports sessions in his holidays there, and he went on an Excellence in Cities course there last year,\" says Jill. \"Most of his friends are going there. It's a wonderful school with beautiful new buildings, thanks to getting specialist technology status. It's got a great academic record and it would be just right for Jack.\" </p> <p>The iron began to crack when Manchester decided to change its catchment policy two years ago, in an attempt to tackle a yawning imbalance between high school intakes. In place of \"official feeder schools\" with guaranteed places, each high school now runs a geographical catchment. </p> <p>Now, Jack's house is just too far away from Parrs Wood, and the family cannot afford to move again to Didsbury - as many people in Withington have done in the past year. The school at the top of Jack's offer has 137 places going begging - not surprisingly after a wretched Ofsted which referred to problems with violence. Jill shudders. The answer for such schools may be parental faith, but it is very hard to be a pioneer. Jack would, she is sure, fail to thrive and would be bullied. </p> <p>Jill's own instinct to appeal was strengthened by local anger; so many Withington parents have been affected by the new feeder scheme that two public meetings have been held and a telephone support network galvanises parents whose children are without a place. She also wrote to her MP, to Estelle Morris and even to Tony Blair. </p> <p>Any private fears about upsetting the appeals panels by embarrassing the city council have been set aside in favour of airing the issue. Newspapers, radio and even TV have all been to Parrs Wood's gates, which are becoming a symbol of Manchester for 2001. </p> <p>Like other parents, Jill is now concentrating on her case to put to the panel, probably at the end of May. Meanwhile, Jack is taking out the stress on his trombone and revision for the key stage 2 Sats. <br><strong> MW</strong> </p> <p> You've read those letters of rejection, you've wept, raged or simply groaned in resignation, and now you're facing the fact that your secondary transfer saga has entered a new and even more desperate phase. </p> <p>It's not as if you haven't already invested enough time and energy trying to secure a place at a secondary school that's to the liking of you and your worried year 6 child. Depressed or even frightened by what your local education authority has to offer close to your home, you devoted most of last autumn to trekking around, attending open evenings, poring over admissions criteria, listening to headteachers assure you that your already slender hopes will disappear completely unless his or her school is at the top of your wish list, unless your little Nibs or Nellie is a violin virtuoso or an intellectual giant, or unless the 300 children likely to be ahead of yours on the waiting list all emigrate or drop dead before September. </p> <p>After intense consideration you pitched your applications and have spent the last two months sleeping with your fingers crossed. And now you've received the bad news. </p> <p>So, what do you do next? First, take what grim comfort you can from knowing you are far from alone. The logical consequences of \"parental choice\" fostered under the Conservatives manifest themselves ever more clearly under new Labour. The over-subscription of popular secondary schools continues to increase, leaving the unpopular ever more beleaguered, and more and more education-minded parents with the distinctly bitter feeling that, in the end, they've been left with no choice at all. </p> <p>The concentration of demand upon the best-regarded schools is a major social phenomenon. Homes are sold, jobs are changed, private tutors are hired and serious lies are told in the battle to be included on next year's year 7 roll. Even schools whose admissions policies conform absolutely to comprehensive principles find their intakes slanted towards those in society best equipped to become winners in the great admissions game. </p> <p>Here, we have interviewed four very different families who have found themselves bruised by this trend. Today, we ask them what exclusion from the school of their choice means to them, and what they intend to do about it. In the weeks to come we shall follow their attempts to overcome that exclusion, peering over their shoulder as they struggle with letters of appeal, following them to the appeal room itself and, finally, accompanying their child to the school gates - wherever they end up. </p> <p>It is impossible to predict what will happen to these families, and to the thousands of others like them. It is certainly true that many will find they have been too quick to dismiss so-called \"sink\" schools. Some will reluctantly settle for such a school in the interim, only to find that, actually, their child settles happily there. </p> <p>It is also true that many disappointed applicants will still get the school they want if they hang on for a bit before calling in Pickfords: even long waiting lists shorten, with places sometimes cropping up as late as the first week of September. </p> <p>But all that notwithstanding, most - like the four families featured here - will already be pondering an appeal. This time two years ago that's just what I was doing. Not for any thing fancy: just a reasonably proximate non-selective, non-denominational mixed school with a broad social blend, wise pastoral policies and an attitude to teaching that combined liberal values with intellectual grit. In other words, one of those \"bog standard\" comprehensives. </p> <p>From the excellent Advisory Centre for Education (ACE) I learned that there are basically two ways to succeed. One is to show that the LEA has messed up its procedures. The other is to convince the panel of (usually three) neutral experts that the problems caused for the school by having to accommodate an extra child would be less than those your child would endure if he or she had to go anywhere else. You make your case for being let in, someone from the school or LEA makes the case for keeping you at bay, and the panel makes its judgment in due course. In other words, you go to war, not only against the school, but against all the other children who have been turned down. </p> <p>My appeal was successful, and I'm glad. But the whole experience also made me sad: sad for other parents and sad that such situations should arise in the first place. The extension of \"choice\" and competition has brought us to a point where the most affluent and well-informed parents tend to take most of what is best while the children of the rest have to make do with what's left over. Even in scenarios where there is no selection by examination, other forms are becoming more entrenched: selection by mortgage, by social skills, by stealth. And the more there is selection, the more there is exclusion. <br><strong> DG</strong> </p> <p>Some of the families' names have been changed.

      "bodyText": "The Dixons Alan Dixon is a quality technician with a car parts firm. His wife, Christine, is a school helper. They live in Hertfordshire with their two children, Tony, nearly 11, and Steven, age nine. \"We live about 600 metres from our first-choice school, but Tony hasn't got a place there. Siblings get priority, and as it's a foundation school they also select up to 35% of its intake by entrance exam and 10% by proficiency in music. \"Then it's whoever lives the nearest. Tony took the entrance exam but obviously didn't do well enough, and there are so many siblings applying that even families living closer than us haven't been offered a place. It's frustrating, because we don't know how close Tony came in his exam, and we won't know where we are on the waiting list until the end of April. Our second choice was another foundation school a few miles away where they interview the pupils and pick the ones they want. I've written to David Blunkett saying I find it incredible that a school can choose its pupils in that way when it's supposed to be the other way round. \"We have been offered another school, a county comprehensive that's working hard to improve, but why should my child have to go on a long bus ride every day to a school that's not as good as any of the ones we wanted? We're hoping an acceptable place will eventually come up, and we'll go to appeal if we have to. But we're also thinking of moving, probably down to the Swindon area, where Christine's family comes from. Maybe Tony and Steven will have a better chance there.\" DG The Trans Hung Tran was an architect in Vietnam until he and his family fled the country seven years ago. His wife, Tuyet, was a sales assistant. Both are now unemployed. They live in inner London with their three children, Duy, 17, Hoa, 14, and Thanh, 11. When Thanh arrived from Vietnam as a refugee seven years ago he spoke no English, but has thrived in his cosmopolitan, inner-London primary school. He is also a keen musician, specialising in the oboe. Sadly, secondary provision in his home borough is uneven and Thanh lives too far from his first-choice school, an over-subscribed mixed county comprehensive, to have been offered a place there. Instead, he's been allotted to a boys' school nearer his home. Thanh's parents do not speak English well, which is why he must speak for himself. \"I want to go to the mixed school because I know it is a good school, especially for a musician. I was very upset when I didn't get a place there. \"I have an older brother who finished at the boys' school last year. He did well in his GCSEs and had some friends, but he was bullied. Because of that I am frightened. We have decided to appeal, and my teachers are helping all they can. They are going to fill in all the forms and someone is going to write a letter for us, explaining all the reasons why my parents think I should go to the school I like. If we don't win the appeal we hope for a place at our second-choice school where the waiting list is shorter. It is not a very good school, but it is still better for me than the boys' school. We don't know what else to do, so if the boys' school is the only one where I can get a place I will have to go there. We don't want to make a fuss.\" DG The Worralls David Worrall is a plastics manufacturer. His wife, Lorraine, is a clerk at Asda. They live in Halifax with their three children, Lee, 13, Jamie, 11 and Katie, six. Lorraine and David spent ages leafing through school details, sports facilities and exam results before filling in their first three choices for Jamie, 11 in June and due to move up to high school next September. But when the buff envelope came back from Calderdale council this month, it was like a Lottery scratchcard gone wrong. Four schools were offered, but not one of them was from the Worralls' own list. The couple were astonished, especially as one of the comprehensives was 12 miles away from their home in Halifax - almost in a different county. The other three were more predictable: schools that Calderdale is trying to rescue from the bottom of its strangely assorted heap. For sad historical reasons, the Yorkshire council has a mixture of grammars, former grant-maintained schools, strongly neighbourhood comps in outlying towns and what amount to secondary moderns, although everyone is trying to raise their game. The squeeze on parental choice is such that the Worralls' ace - a sibling already at their first-choice school for Jamie - has been trumped. Their elder son Lee is 13 and flourishing at Holy Trinity, but the CofE high school had 242 applications for 180 places. Lorraine can do the sums. But she and David are also counting on strength in numbers. \"There are five children in Jamie's class at the primary who now haven't got schools to go to - who'll be staying behind when the others go off for the transition day at Holy Trinity or the other high schools,\" she says.

It is also a health hazard - dirty wards and poor standards of hygiene are believed to be linked to sharp rises in the number of patients who get hospital-acquired infections, which kill 5,000 people a year and cost the NHS \u00a31bn. <strong>What do you mean by filthy hospitals, exactly?</strong><br> Dirty linen, cigarette buts in the corridors, uncollected litter, food trays not removed for days, dust under the beds, overflowing toilets, and - in one survey - pigeons flapping around a canteen. Hospital inspection teams assessed hygiene and cleanliness in 14 categories, including ward furniture, linen, car parks, toilets, smells and the state of public areas such as accident and emergency departments. <strong>How did the NHS get so dirty?</strong><br> One explanation is the decision to contract out health service cleaning and catering services to the private sector in the 1980s through the competitive tendering process. Unions claim that contractors frequently cut corners in order to come up with the lowest bid, and that quality suffered as a result. The outsourcing of cleaning meant that cleaners were no longer accountable to ward sisters and other NHS staff, who found it difficult to order improvements. <strong>What has the government done about it?</strong><br> Last summer it launched the NHS hospital clean-up initiative, backed with \u00a331m allocated to trusts to redecorate wards and refurbish public areas. Each trust was then inspected in the autumn by patient environment action teams, made up of patient representatives and NHS professionals. In the autumn it promised to end compulsory competitive tendering of cleaning services - although trusts can still go private if they believe it will raise quality. It has also announced it is to re-introduce hospital matrons - who will have the power to sack contractors who fail to meet cleanliness standards. <strong>What did the inspections find?</strong><br> In autumn 2000, some 253 of 700 hospitals in England received \"poor\" ratings for cleanliness. By the end of the second round of inspections in January and February 2001, that figure had dropped to 40, with 10 of those hospitals put on \"special measures\" as a result of the poor cleanliness standards. Of the five trusts that ran these trusts, four had employed private contractors. <strong>How will standards be maintained?</strong><br> The government has launched national cleaning standards for all NHS hospitals. These have five key objectives: taking cleanliness seriously; listening to patient feedback; ensuring hospital-acquired infections are controlled; ensuring staff are properly trained; and that cleanliness is monitored. Ministers have promised that by the autumn no hospital will have \"poor\" standards of cleanliness.</p>",

In the autumn it promised to end compulsory competitive tendering of cleaning services - although trusts can still go private if they believe it will raise quality. It has also announced it is to re-introduce hospital matrons - who will have the power to sack contractors who fail to meet cleanliness standards. What did the inspections find? In autumn 2000, some 253 of 700 hospitals in England received \"poor\" ratings for cleanliness. By the end of the second round of inspections in January and February 2001, that figure had dropped to 40, with 10 of those hospitals put on \"special measures\" as a result of the poor cleanliness standards. Of the five trusts that ran these trusts, four had employed private contractors. How will standards be maintained? The government has launched national cleaning standards for all NHS hospitals. These have five key objectives: taking cleanliness seriously; listening to patient feedback; ensuring hospital-acquired infections are controlled; ensuring staff are properly trained; and that cleanliness is monitored. Ministers have promised that by the autumn no hospital will have \"poor\" standards of cleanliness.",

Although we all came from the dole with a tidy bounty of FEFC, DfEE and European Social Fund funding per head, it was obvious that the money was not being spent on us. By January we had lost almost half our number, the weaker ones finding it too hard to cling to the upturned lifeboats with no rescue in sight.

Some old habits die hard at Lucie Clayton. </p> <p>But others don't. Lucie Clayton was founded in 1928 as a college to teach \"naice young gels\" the basics of deportment, flower arranging, make-up and finding rich husbands. By the 1960s, even though its more beautiful and long-legged students, such as Jean Shrimpton, were still being signed up by the college's Modelling Agency arm, the number of top-toff totty wishing to be \"finished off\" had slowed to a trickle. Which is why, over the last 10 years or so, Lucie Clayton has reinvented itself as a successful secretarial and business college. </p> <p>\"We still get girls coming to us after completing their GCSEs who don't want to go to do A-levels,\" says Kark, the college principal, \"but we also get girls in their gap year, graduates and women who want to retrain to re-enter the workplace. On some of our shorter courses we even get a few men.\" </p> <p>The courses themselves range from a few days up to a full year, are pitched at a number of levels and may include anything from shorthand to IT to budgeting, marketing, PR and law.

The list of employers associated with the college reads like a Who's Who of London's corporate beau monde, with the likes of Amanda Wakely, Arthur Andersen, Hermes, JWT Advertising, the BBC, Vogue, Schroders - not to mention Buck House - well to the fore. \"Most of our students will have three or four job offers by the time they leave,\" Ms Kark insists. </p> <p>This undoubtedly helps to balance the financial equation. The traditional Lucie Clayton student or parent almost certainly had more money than sense and any amount of cash to get the young Camilla out of the stately pile was probably considered well-spent. And, to be fair, there may be still a bit of that around as the college still gets at least one phonecall a day from parents looking for a touch of grooming for their kiddies. But for the vast majority, with the fees at roughly \u00a32,500 per term, money will be an issue. </p> <p>\"For well over 50% of our students, Lucie Clayton's will be the first time they have entered the independent education sector,\" Ms Kark points out. </p> <p>It's not all hard business studies, though, as the college still finds time for some of the more arcane fluffier arts on which it built its reputation. </p> <p>\"We don't actually have lessons on deportment as the girls would run a mile at the idea,\" says Ms Kark good-naturedly, \"but we still have a personal development programme which teaches the girls how to make the best of themselves at interview, and we do sneak in a bit of make-up and body language here.\" </p> <p>\"Anything on how to make conversation with a sheikh?\" </p> <p>\"Mmm,\" she replies with a smile. \"It's an idea.\" </p> <p>\"What about getting in and out of cars without flashing your knickers?\" </p> <p>\"We used to have a metal frame in the back garden for practising just that, but we got rid of it some time ago.

      "body": "<p>When I started teaching philosophy in the prison it was a bit of a leap in the dark. </p> <p>\"They'll love it,\" Gwen, a full-time tutor, kept on saying. Gwen, after donkey's years with these guys, really does believe in their goodness. </p> <p>\"He just wants his mum really,\" is a typical Gwenism when some shaven- headed 18-stoner has shuffled off, pouting after one of her bollockings. So I shuffled off, obedient myself, to get philosophy launched on the sea of scepticism that I was sure awaited me. </p> <p>Most of the guys were as unsure as I was about what was going to happen, although, as I found out later one or two of them, who had Open University degrees on the walls of their cells, were being a bit disingenuous. </p> <p>Philosophy: it does have a bit of a ring to it, especially doing it in prison; it sounds rather wise, stately, a little bit superior. It didn't take long for us to leave that kind of nonsense behind. Wayne, direct as ever, gets us started. </p> <p>\"Come on then, Al, what's it all about, philosophy? How would you define it?\" </p> <p>I'm tempted to ask him, \"What do you mean, definition?\" but some merciful instinct for self-preservation stops me. They don't want some clever undergraduate posturing, these guys want an answer they can get a grip on right here and now so I tell them a bit about Socratic method, the method of the idiot child. </p> <p>\"You know,\" I tell them, \"when some daft kid keeps on asking, why? why?\" Yes, they know about that. \"Well that's all that philosophy is. Philosophers just ask why.\" </p> <p>There is a certain amount of storm to weather here. </p> <p>\"Is that it then? Is that all there is to it?\" \"Well, yes,\" I say, suddenly fearful that they will walk out on me and leave me to face Gwen with the ruin that I have made of her bright idea. </p> <p>All this was months ago now and I have settled down with a regular group of 12. People come and go as sentences end and new guys are shipped in and this means that there are quite regular crises as philosophy virgins are seduced into our strange ways. Philosophy has attracted men who have long sentences to serve and they bring into class the hard-faced generosity that gets them through the years. They say things that frighten me to death. Wayne on abortion: \"If we could turn back the years, Mark, wouldn't it be better, knowing as we do now that you were going to turn out to be a murdering nut-case who's been nothing but a drain on society, wouldn't aborting you have been a good idea?\" </p> <p>Dear God, I think, head in hands, he's gone too far this time. I ought to have warned him about all the trouble that Socrates was landed in by philosophy. But these guys are neighbours on the wing. They smile at each other. Sometimes, less often now, I get a bad time for being a weakling. </p> <p>\"For God's sake Al will you use your authority and sort these bastards out.\" \"I have no authority, I repudiate it, I spit on authority.\" \"Don't start all that shit,\" Pete tells me, knowing my game. \"Right,\" says Wayne, brusquely, \"come on let's get on with this.\" \"I'll read this next bit shall I,\" says Pete. I shrug and away we go. </p> <p>Wayne is a real asset; he just keeps on asking the obvious questions that no one else will ask for fear of looking stupid. He knows nothing. Or does he? Are his questions just a bit too good naturedly naive? I promise myself to get someone to have a peek in his pad where I suspect there are walls full of philosophy books. \"Hold on,\" he says, the devious Yorkshire simpleton, \"what's metaphysics then?\" Before I can tumble into his trap, Isaac turns to him and treats us all to a lucid, delightful explanation. Isaac is the youngest by far and can get terrible stick, but I suspect that he has just done himself a power of good. \"Right, OK,\" Wayne says, nodding gently into Isaac's beaming face. </p> <p>We have been talking about aesthetics for the past month or so. This has led us into censorship and this week we have been reading JM Coetzee on Taking Offence. Coetzee suggests that taking offence is a transaction where the powerful and the powerless exchange roles and potencies. Far too late it dawns on me that making this explicit could get one or two of the more idealistic guys into trouble back on the wings where shifts in power, suspected or real, can have swift and devastating consequences. </p> <p>\"Now don't try this at home,\" I keep on saying, panic mounting as I wish more and more that I had stuck to Epistemology or Philosophy of Mind. Fortunately I have Mo and Pete in the class. These are the steadiest men you could hope to meet, both well into their second decade of imprisonment. Men I admire. Both of them scholars who put me to shame. They try out the idea and try its fit into various contexts: apartheid South Africa, family, prison. Wayne, who has really taken a shine to my version of Socratic method harries them into explanations, forces the occasional pursed- lipped concession.

      "bodyText": "When I started teaching philosophy in the prison it was a bit of a leap in the dark. \"They'll love it,\" Gwen, a full-time tutor, kept on saying. Gwen, after donkey's years with these guys, really does believe in their goodness. \"He just wants his mum really,\" is a typical Gwenism when some shaven- headed 18-stoner has shuffled off, pouting after one of her bollockings. So I shuffled off, obedient myself, to get philosophy launched on the sea of scepticism that I was sure awaited me. Most of the guys were as unsure as I was about what was going to happen, although, as I found out later one or two of them, who had Open University degrees on the walls of their cells, were being a bit disingenuous. Philosophy: it does have a bit of a ring to it, especially doing it in prison; it sounds rather wise, stately, a little bit superior. It didn't take long for us to leave that kind of nonsense behind. Wayne, direct as ever, gets us started. \"Come on then, Al, what's it all about, philosophy? How would you define it?\" I'm tempted to ask him, \"What do you mean, definition?\" but some merciful instinct for self-preservation stops me. They don't want some clever undergraduate posturing, these guys want an answer they can get a grip on right here and now so I tell them a bit about Socratic method, the method of the idiot child. \"You know,\" I tell them, \"when some daft kid keeps on asking, why? why?\" Yes, they know about that. \"Well that's all that philosophy is. Philosophers just ask why.\" There is a certain amount of storm to weather here. \"Is that it then? Is that all there is to it?\" \"Well, yes,\" I say, suddenly fearful that they will walk out on me and leave me to face Gwen with the ruin that I have made of her bright idea. All this was months ago now and I have settled down with a regular group of 12. People come and go as sentences end and new guys are shipped in and this means that there are quite regular crises as philosophy virgins are seduced into our strange ways. Philosophy has attracted men who have long sentences to serve and they bring into class the hard-faced generosity that gets them through the years. They say things that frighten me to death. Wayne on abortion: \"If we could turn back the years, Mark, wouldn't it be better, knowing as we do now that you were going to turn out to be a murdering nut-case who's been nothing but a drain on society, wouldn't aborting you have been a good idea?\" Dear God, I think, head in hands, he's gone too far this time. I ought to have warned him about all the trouble that Socrates was landed in by philosophy. But these guys are neighbours on the wing. They smile at each other. Sometimes, less often now, I get a bad time for being a weakling. \"For God's sake Al will you use your authority and sort these bastards out.\" \"I have no authority, I repudiate it, I spit on authority.\" \"Don't start all that shit,\" Pete tells me, knowing my game. \"Right,\" says Wayne, brusquely, \"come on let's get on with this.\" \"I'll read this next bit shall I,\" says Pete. I shrug and away we go. Wayne is a real asset; he just keeps on asking the obvious questions that no one else will ask for fear of looking stupid. He knows nothing. Or does he? Are his questions just a bit too good naturedly naive? I promise myself to get someone to have a peek in his pad where I suspect there are walls full of philosophy books. \"Hold on,\" he says, the devious Yorkshire simpleton, \"what's metaphysics then?\" Before I can tumble into his trap, Isaac turns to him and treats us all to a lucid, delightful explanation. Isaac is the youngest by far and can get terrible stick, but I suspect that he has just done himself a power of good. \"Right, OK,\" Wayne says, nodding gently into Isaac's beaming face. We have been talking about aesthetics for the past month or so. This has led us into censorship and this week we have been reading JM Coetzee on Taking Offence. Coetzee suggests that taking offence is a transaction where the powerful and the powerless exchange roles and potencies. Far too late it dawns on me that making this explicit could get one or two of the more idealistic guys into trouble back on the wings where shifts in power, suspected or real, can have swift and devastating consequences. \"Now don't try this at home,\" I keep on saying, panic mounting as I wish more and more that I had stuck to Epistemology or Philosophy of Mind. Fortunately I have Mo and Pete in the class. These are the steadiest men you could hope to meet, both well into their second decade of imprisonment. Men I admire. Both of them scholars who put me to shame. They try out the idea and try its fit into various contexts: apartheid South Africa, family, prison. Wayne, who has really taken a shine to my version of Socratic method harries them into explanations, forces the occasional pursed- lipped concession. Johnny and Steve are quiet, ironic observers, dropping in occasional gems or deflating absurdities. They watch me struggle to get a word in and smile as they see my temper going and language deteriorating. I was so unpleasant last week that I brought in a bag of sweets by way of apology. They are not impressed. \"He only bought these,\" Mo points out, \"because he was such a right bastard last time.\" After two hours of this I feel drained and buzzing all at once.

Does Health and Safety realise we are floundering and gasping behind those Shut windows - like a pod of beached whales? And as for all those near misses on stairs or down stairwells . . . </p> <p>There are the tables, too. How many of us are at this moment nursing bruised shins and thighs? We have a special brand of table in our college - I don't know if it's exclusive to us and the rest of you are exempt - with a metal bar along one side.

The thigh bruises are because the demon tables are thigh height. </p> <p>Don't even think about electricity and water. </p> <p>The staffroom is no more reassuring. My neighbour has two sharp blades on his desk. The fact that they are face-to-face and called scissors does not blunt their potential. And have you ever had a near miss with a hole punch or a stapler? We even have something in our staff room which is called a guillotine. It is not used very much. </p> <p>Then there is the wall cupboard. It seems to have been put on the wall after the most detailed, prolonged and meticulous research into the precise height required to deliver the hardest possible blow to the adult human head in transit. It's only got me once. And a few months later, when I'd recovered, I mentioned it to Oberon (our staff room's party-goer) who told me that when it got him he saw stars. </p> <p>I can only think the wall cupboard is designed to solve the near miss of damaging your back bending down to a floor cupboard. </p> <p>The police got involved in this dilemma once. They arrested a whole class of our students who were making their way to the bus stop one evening after their practical exam. The police took them down to the station and emptied out their bags. It was then some time before the police were persuaded that the hammers and spanners and Stanley knives and saws were the tools of law-abiding and skilful people on their way home from a day's work. </p> <p>So the doorstop remains and we have to trust that none of us are wrong-footed.</p>",

There are the tables, too. How many of us are at this moment nursing bruised shins and thighs? We have a special brand of table in our college - I don't know if it's exclusive to us and the rest of you are exempt - with a metal bar along one side. If you sit down at the \"wrong\" side of the table, your shin gets a thwack that leaves you marked for days. The thigh bruises are because the demon tables are thigh height. Don't even think about electricity and water. The staffroom is no more reassuring. My neighbour has two sharp blades on his desk. The fact that they are face-to-face and called scissors does not blunt their potential. And have you ever had a near miss with a hole punch or a stapler? We even have something in our staff room which is called a guillotine. It is not used very much. Then there is the wall cupboard. It seems to have been put on the wall after the most detailed, prolonged and meticulous research into the precise height required to deliver the hardest possible blow to the adult human head in transit. It's only got me once. And a few months later, when I'd recovered, I mentioned it to Oberon (our staff room's party-goer) who told me that when it got him he saw stars. I can only think the wall cupboard is designed to solve the near miss of damaging your back bending down to a floor cupboard. The police got involved in this dilemma once. They arrested a whole class of our students who were making their way to the bus stop one evening after their practical exam. The police took them down to the station and emptied out their bags. It was then some time before the police were persuaded that the hammers and spanners and Stanley knives and saws were the tools of law-abiding and skilful people on their way home from a day's work. So the doorstop remains and we have to trust that none of us are wrong-footed.",

Most programmers write in \"high-level\" languages like Basic, which effectively shield them from the details of the hardware.</p> <p> As Linus himself says, he has always been a \"low-level\" person. There are probably two reasons for his early interest in this aspect. One was his emerging love of programming at the most fundamental level. The other is more pragmatic: \"I had been a performance junkie since forever. When you had to be kind of crazy and tweak cycles.\" \"Tweaking cycles\" - getting every last drop of performance out of code - would later mean that Linux was far faster and leaner than comparable programs.</p> <p> In the end, Linus chose an unusual micro for his next machine, the Sinclair QL (\"Quantum Leap\"). This was a typically quirky product from the British inventor Sir Clive Sinclair.</p> <p> Linus had been content to put up with Sinclaire's QL - although it had some fairly obvious shortcomings - for a simple reason. The main thing he wanted, he explained, was \"a machine at home that does multitasking.\" Even though the Sinclair QL was in many ways a toy, it had one very powerful feature, thanks to its choice of chip: it could run several programs simultaneously, just like commercial minicomputers.</p> <p> This area of computing - multitasking - led him to start coding the simple program that would eventually turn into Linux. But this was still some years off from the time when Linus was hacking on his Sinclair QL. First, in the fall of 1988, he entered Helsinki University to study computer science, which by now already looked likely to turn from a passion into a profession.</p> <p> At university, Linus found the same tendency for the two language communities in Finland to keep to themselves. His fellow student in computer science, Lars Wirzenius, comments that \"at that time there weren't many Swedish-speaking computer science students, and those that were, were at least a couple of years older than we were.\" It was therefore only natural that a pair of Swedish speakers isolated among the Finnish majority of the new intake for computer studies should gravitate towards each other.</p> <p> Wirzenius recalls that the first time he met Linus, \"it was one of the introductory lectures for new students.,\" Wirzenius didn't notice much of his friend that day except that \"the end of his big nose tends to twitch up and down when he speaks, and it is fun to look at.\" Aside from the nose, which, in truth, is not that big, little in Linus's appearance is out of the ordinary: He is of medium height, with brown hair; his blue eyes gaze steadily from behind his glasses. Only the eyebrows, which are remarkably dark and bushy, jar slightly with the otherwise boyish face.</p> <p> In an effort to meet more student members of the Duck Pond, Wirzenius and Linus joined one of the many societies that form an important element of Helsinki University's student scene. \"The club that Linus and I joined was called the Spektrum,\" Wirzenius recalls, \"which is the Swedish-speaking club for people who study math, computer science, physics, or chemistry.\" As far as the teaching at the university was concerned, Wirzenius explains that \"there isn't actually a curriculum which says that during the first year you have to take this course and that course. The so-called academic freedom in Finland is interpreted so that students can take any course they want, mostly in whichever order they want.</p> <p> \"The nominal study length is five years, but most people study for six or seven years,\" he continues. Alongside the main courses there were various ancillary subjects. \"To get a computer science degree, you have to study a certain amount of math, and also some other subjects. Each week we got some exercises to do, and then we had small groups of people and a teacher who asked each one of us to demonstrate some of the problems we were supposed to have solved. And if you hadn't solved all the problems, that was OK, but you had to solve a certain amount to pass the course.</p> <p> \"One of these weeks, Linus - for some reason, I don't remember - hadn't done all his homework. So he just claimed that he had done one of the exercises that he hadn't done - and the teacher asked him to demonstrate his solution. [Linus] walked up to the blackboard\u00db and faced the problem that he claimed he had solved. Linus decides this is a simple problem, draws a couple of diagrams, and waves his hand a lot. It takes a long time for the teacher to understand that yes, this is actually a correct solution.\"</p> <p> According to Wirzenius, this incident was atypical in one respect: \"[Linus] didn't usually try to cheat, because he didn't have to. He knew math well from high school, and had a sort of mathematical brain, so he didn't have to spend much time on homework to get it done.\" Wirzenius believes there is something characteristic of his friend in the way Linus handled the situation - \"the attitude, the arrogance that he displayed - most people would just have acknowledged that they didn't actually have a solution,\" but Linus hates having to admit that he doesn't know the answer.</p> <p> Wirzenius says that \"the arrogance he showed then is still visible\" in how Linus handles challenges within the Linux community. \"These days, he might claim that a certain kind of approach to a problem is the correct problem, even though he hasn't necessarily thought about all the other approaches or solutions, and then the rest of the Internet either agrees with him or tries to convince him otherwise.\"</p> <p> This approach works because Linus is \"careful enough to not do it all the time. Most of the time when he says something, he ahs been thinking about it, \"Wirzenius notes, and concludes: \"I wouldn't like to play poker against him. He can bluff. \"Just as important, if after all the bluffing Linus is caught out and shown to be wrong, Wirzenius says, he will accept corrections with good grace, a trait that would prove crucial in managing the community of equally opinionated and able hackers that would later coalesce around him.</p> <p> After the first year's introductory course, there followed a major hiatus in their university studies. \"all Finnish men are requires to do either military or civil service, \"Wirzenius says. Civil service is sort of you get an ordinary job but you don't get paid for it.\" In 1989, when he and Linus were required to choose, \"the shortest time to do military service was eight months [and] all civil service was sixteen months. So I figured that's eight months too much, so let's do the shortest possible. Actually the totally shortest possible way would be to refuse to do either kind of service, and then it would be six months in jail.\"</p> <p> Like Wirzenius, Linus too, decided that he'd rather not spend half a year in prison. But instead of choosing the next shortest option - eight months as a simple army private - he opted for one that lasted eleven months, which was training to become a noncommissioned officer.</p> <p> Of this training, Wirzenius says, \"It's sort of useful as an exercise in leadership, but a certain kind of leadership\u00db what the army needs is group leaders who can teach their group to act almost on reflex, which was sort of scary. It's the same kind of stuff that all armies teach.\" He adds, \"It's not just a way to learn how to make reflexes, but also a way to keep a group together as a working unit even if they don't like each other, and stuff like that.\" It is hard to imagine a better description of what would be involved in coordinating the global movement of volunteers that develop Linux.</p> <p> Wirzenius recalls that he and Linus didn't see much of each other during that time even though they were both stationed in the same area of East Finland towards the end of their service; however, they made up for lost time when they were back at university and had resumed their exploration of the computer world.</p> <p> They began with a course that would have an effect not only on them - Wirzenius said that it felt \"sort of like falling in love for the first time\" - but on the entire history of computing. In the fall of 1990, they stared using the university's recently acquired MicroVAX system, designed by none other than Dave Cutler, at the moment busily at work on Windows NT. Wirzenius and Linus were about to discover Unix.</p> <p> The program that caused Linus's hart to beat a little faster in the fall of 1991 was Digital's Ultrix, one of the many commercial variants of the Unix operating system. Others included Sun's Solaris, IBM's AIX and Hewlett-Packard's HP-UX. Despite the confusion of versions, they all derived from thee original Unix system created by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie at the AT&amp;T's Bell Labs in 1969 - the year Linus was born.</p> <p> Peter Salus, author of A Quarter Century of Unix, generally regarded as the standard history of the operating system, explains how Unix came about: \"At the beginning of 1969, there was a group of people working on a project that was MIT, AT&amp;T Bell Labs and General Electric. The project was called Multics. In February 1969, they were several millions behind budget, they were months and months behind schedule, and the powers that be at Bell Labs decided this is never going to go anywhere, and they pulled out of the arrangement.</p> <p> \"And that left the not-quite half-dozen Bell employees who had been involved in the project without anything to do,\" Salus continues, \"but with a large number of ideas they had picked up from the cross-fertilization with GE and with MIT.\" Among them were Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie; they decided that a \"cut-down version of this incredible project could be doable for a much smaller machine\" than the original project used. The machine that the project was working on was a GE 645, and it was what you would call a large piece of iron,\" Salus says.</p> <p> \"Dennis and Ken began plotting down some ideas on a blackboard,\" he continues. \"In August of '69', Ken Thompson and his spouse had a new son and it was now almost a year old, and none of their relatives, all of whom were on the West Coast of the U.S., had seen them. So [Ken's wife] Bonnie took their not quite one-year-old and flew to the West Coast for the month of August 1969.\"</p> <p> During this time, Salus says, \"Ken just sat down and wrote the Unix operating system in four weeks, in assembler\" - the low-level programming language that is only slightly easier to use and entering binary digits of machine code directly. \"He told me it wasn't so bad; all I could say is that was truly what Brooks would call the Mythical Man-Month - it was a real, single man-month by a man [whom] I consider probably the [greatest] master programmer I've ever encountered. It was quite amazing, \"Salus continued, Fred Brooks's classic 1974 book of essays, The Mythical Man-Month, was an early and perceptive analysis of the problems of managing large software projects.</p> <p> With the new Unix came a new way of thinking about operating systems. \"The Unix philosophy is really very easy,\" Salus says, \"and consists of maybe two or three notions. The first one, which is perhaps the most innovative this that Thompson ever though of, is that everything is a file. Second is the notion that when you build something, no matter whether it's an editor or whether it's a way of attaching one file to another file, you write things that are for a single purpose but do that purpose well.\"</p> <p> Although the first of these would have some amusing personal consequences for Linus, it was the second element that proved key for the success of Linux. It meant that a Unix-like operating system could be built piecemeal, and that others could help with the task by working independently on some of the various components. It was even conceivable that the one person alone - if exceptional enough - could put together the entire operating system if given enough time.</p>",

But instead of choosing the next shortest option - eight months as a simple army private - he opted for one that lasted eleven months, which was training to become a noncommissioned officer. Of this training, Wirzenius says, \"It's sort of useful as an exercise in leadership, but a certain kind of leadership\u00db what the army needs is group leaders who can teach their group to act almost on reflex, which was sort of scary. It's the same kind of stuff that all armies teach.\" He adds, \"It's not just a way to learn how to make reflexes, but also a way to keep a group together as a working unit even if they don't like each other, and stuff like that.\" It is hard to imagine a better description of what would be involved in coordinating the global movement of volunteers that develop Linux. Wirzenius recalls that he and Linus didn't see much of each other during that time even though they were both stationed in the same area of East Finland towards the end of their service; however, they made up for lost time when they were back at university and had resumed their exploration of the computer world. They began with a course that would have an effect not only on them - Wirzenius said that it felt \"sort of like falling in love for the first time\" - but on the entire history of computing. In the fall of 1990, they stared using the university's recently acquired MicroVAX system, designed by none other than Dave Cutler, at the moment busily at work on Windows NT. Wirzenius and Linus were about to discover Unix. The program that caused Linus's hart to beat a little faster in the fall of 1991 was Digital's Ultrix, one of the many commercial variants of the Unix operating system. Others included Sun's Solaris, IBM's AIX and Hewlett-Packard's HP-UX. Despite the confusion of versions, they all derived from thee original Unix system created by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie at the AT&amp;T's Bell Labs in 1969 - the year Linus was born. Peter Salus, author of A Quarter Century of Unix, generally regarded as the standard history of the operating system, explains how Unix came about: \"At the beginning of 1969, there was a group of people working on a project that was MIT, AT&amp;T Bell Labs and General Electric. The project was called Multics. In February 1969, they were several millions behind budget, they were months and months behind schedule, and the powers that be at Bell Labs decided this is never going to go anywhere, and they pulled out of the arrangement. \"And that left the not-quite half-dozen Bell employees who had been involved in the project without anything to do,\" Salus continues, \"but with a large number of ideas they had picked up from the cross-fertilization with GE and with MIT.\" Among them were Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie; they decided that a \"cut-down version of this incredible project could be doable for a much smaller machine\" than the original project used. The machine that the project was working on was a GE 645, and it was what you would call a large piece of iron,\" Salus says. \"Dennis and Ken began plotting down some ideas on a blackboard,\" he continues. \"In August of '69', Ken Thompson and his spouse had a new son and it was now almost a year old, and none of their relatives, all of whom were on the West Coast of the U.S., had seen them. So [Ken's wife] Bonnie took their not quite one-year-old and flew to the West Coast for the month of August 1969.\" During this time, Salus says, \"Ken just sat down and wrote the Unix operating system in four weeks, in assembler\" - the low-level programming language that is only slightly easier to use and entering binary digits of machine code directly. \"He told me it wasn't so bad; all I could say is that was truly what Brooks would call the Mythical Man-Month - it was a real, single man-month by a man [whom] I consider probably the [greatest] master programmer I've ever encountered. It was quite amazing, \"Salus continued, Fred Brooks's classic 1974 book of essays, The Mythical Man-Month, was an early and perceptive analysis of the problems of managing large software projects. With the new Unix came a new way of thinking about operating systems. \"The Unix philosophy is really very easy,\" Salus says, \"and consists of maybe two or three notions. The first one, which is perhaps the most innovative this that Thompson ever though of, is that everything is a file. Second is the notion that when you build something, no matter whether it's an editor or whether it's a way of attaching one file to another file, you write things that are for a single purpose but do that purpose well.\" Although the first of these would have some amusing personal consequences for Linus, it was the second element that proved key for the success of Linux. It meant that a Unix-like operating system could be built piecemeal, and that others could help with the task by working independently on some of the various components. It was even conceivable that the one person alone - if exceptional enough - could put together the entire operating system if given enough time.",

      "body": "<p>Once Stallman had decided on this new course of action - creating a free operating system - he soon made \"the major design decision - that we would follow Unix,\" he says. In retrospect, it might have seemed the obvious choice, but at the time this was by' no means the case because Stallman knew little about the system. \"I'd never used it,\" he says. \"I'd only read a little about it, but it seemed like it was a good, clean design [that had some] nice clean and powerful ideas.\"</p> <p> But the main impetus for his choice grew once again out of his experiences during the diaspora of the hacker community at the AI Lab. \"Digital had discontinued the PDP - 1O\" - the last machine on which ITS had run - \"which meant that ITS was now completely unusable on any modern computer,\" Stallman says. \"And I didn't want that kind of thing to happen again. The only way to prevent it from happening again was to write a portable system.\"</p> <p> Stallman wanted an operating system that could be easily transferred from one type of hardware to another. Because most operating systems had been conceived as the housekeeping software for one type of computer, portability was the exception rather than the rule. \"Unix was, at least as far as I knew, the only portable system that really had users on different kinds of computers. So it was portable not just in theory but in actual practice,\" Stallman says.</p> <p> Another important reason why Stallman chose Unix as his model, he explains, was that he \"decided to make the system compatible with Unix so people who had already written programs for Unix would be able to run them on this system. People who knew how to use Unix would know how to use this system without being required to learn something new.\" Once again, as he had with Emacs, he was building on something that already existed, but making it better - in this case, by creating a Unix - like system that could be shared freely</p> <p> Although the project was born at this most unhappy time for Stallman, the name he chose for his new project showed a typical hacker humor. His Unix work-alike would be called GNU, an acronym that stood for \"GNU'S Not Unix,\" and which thus explained itself self referentially. This kind of recursion is often used as a programming technique, and applying it to words is highly popular amongst hackers.</p> <p> The name GNU also proved a fruitful source of inspiration for similarly self-referential names for many of the programs that went to make up the overall GNU project. Another important virtue of Unix was that its design \"consists of a lot of small pieces, often fairly small pieces,\" Stallman explains; to create a Unix-like system, \"what you do is you just have to write each piece. So I sat down and started writing small pieces.\"</p> <p> Although this makes the entire process sound disarmingly simple, writing these \"small pieces\" involved reproducing work that had taken hundreds of people fifteen years - an even harder task than when Stallman matched the team of programmers at Symbolics. In his fight against that company, he was able to look at the source code - the underlying lines of programming - to help him write his own versions: hut with Unix this was not an option.</p> <p> \"I certainly never looked at the source code of Unix,\" Stallman says. \"Never. I once accidentally saw a file, and when I realized it was part of Unix source code, I stopped looking at it.\" The reason was simple: The source code \"was a trade secret, and I didn't want to be accused of stealing that trade secret,\" he says. \"I condemn trade secrecy, I think it's an immoral practice, but for the project to succeed, I had to work within the immoral laws that existed.\"</p> <p> Once again Stallman had set himself an almost impossible task that would require an exhaustive dedication and sacrifice - which was perhaps part of the attraction. \"I wasn't certain I could finish the job,\" he recalls, \"but it wasn't important for me to know whether I could finish the job; the point was I was going to start it.\"</p> <p> The GNU project formally began, in January 1984, when Stallman started working on a replacement for an obscure programmer's tool called Yacc. One reason he chose this was \"because there was a similar program available called Bison\" - another typical hacker pun - but it wasn't compatible with Yacc; it was missing some features.\" Stallman obtained permission from the author to make Bison compatible with Yacc, and in doing so, he put in place the first small stone of the GNU edifice.</p> <p> Having limbered up with this relatively minor task, Stallman moved on to one of the most important. One of the key elements of a Unix system is the C compiler. Programs written in C are text files whose contents are lines of instructions following the rules of the language. Before a computer can obey the instructions contained in the source code, they must be converted into binaries - the sequence of Os and 1s that the processor chip can understand.</p> <p> This is the job of the C compiler - a kind of mediator between the source code and binaries, which is therefore an indispensable tool for every C programmer. As such, it held a particular importance for Stallman in his endeavor to create a new, freely available version of Unix. A poor C compiler might seriously damage the chances of GNU's being taken seriously; equally, a great C compiler that was free would immediately make people sit up and take notice of the project.</p> <p> Once more, Stallman tried to build on an existing program to minimize the amount of work that needed doing, and something he had heard about seemed to be perfect for the job. The Amsterdam Compiler Kit was a powerful compiler that ran on Unix and could compile not just C but most of the languages then in use. It had been written by the U.S. academic Andrew Tanenbaum at the Free University of Amsterdam. Perhaps slightly misled by another name for the software - the Free University Compiler Kit - Stallman wrote to Tanenbaum to ask whether he could use it for his GNU project.</p> <p> As Stallman recalls, [Tanenbaum] said, \"The university is free; the compiler isn't. Why don't you give up that silly idea of a free system? I'd like to have some utilities to distribute with the compiler to boost sales. Contribute some utilities to me and I'll give you a share of the profits.\" What seemed eminently reasonable - generous even - to Tanenbaum, was an insult to Stallman, for whom proprietary software of the kind represented by the Amsterdam Compiler Kit was precisely what he was hoping to combat with his GNU project.</p> <p> Tanenbaum doesn't recall what he said exactly, but he explains why he was unable to give permission for the Amsterdam Compiler Kit (ACK) to be used by Stallman as part of GNU: \"I think we may have already signed a contract to sell ACK commercially via a company in the U.S. and one in Europe,\" he says. \"Our research group needed that money to support graduate students, etc., and as I recall, we were already committed when he came around.\"</p> <p> Despite these laudable aims, Stallman saw only Tanenbaum's refusal to aid him in his free software crusade. His response was identical to that he had made to Symbolics a few years earlier: He determined to write his own rival software that would match or beat the offending code.</p> <p> In September 1984, after an unsuccessful attempt to adapt yet another compiler, Stallman returned to his most successful program so far, Emacs. The code for this new Emacs, which became known as GNU Emacs, had \"nothing in common with the original Emacs, which was written in TECO,\" Stallman says. And in another symbolic act of return to his AI Lab roots, he decided to rewrite most of GNU Emacs in Lisp, that \"powerful and elegant language\" Stallman prized so highly.</p> <p> By early 1985, GNU Emacs was able to edit files, and Stallman made it available publicly. This was an important step because it represented the first time people could use and judge GNU software. Even though the free GNU operating system was almost nonexistent, people could still use Emacs: The Unix compatibility that was Stallman's constant guide meant that GNU Emacs could run on any Unix and provide him with a huge potential constituency of users.</p> <p> First, \"people started asking for and writing improvements, and the result was I kept working on Emacs a lot, much longer that I'd expected to, and it ended up much better than I'd originally planned on its being,\" recalls Stallman. This approach of releasing code and encouraging feedback and modifications from users, although not new - it had formed an implicit part of the entire Unix culture for year - became central to the rapid improvement of free software over the next fifteen years. Its adoption in an extreme form for the development of Linux was one of the key factors in its rapid growth and robustness.</p> <p> The second consequence of making Emacs available was that Stallman could sell it on tape, the standard distribution medium before floppies; this was alongside free distribution on the Internet because at that time few people had access to this fledgling medium. As well as serving users who might otherwise find it difficult to obtain copies, selling tapes bad the even more beneficial effect of giving Stallman an income. \"See,\" he says, \"I had quit my job at MIT to start the GNU project. And the reason is I wanted to make sure that MIT would not be in a position to interfere with making GNU software free in the way I wanted to do it. I didn't want to have to beg the MIT administration for permission to do this and then maybe they would insist on spoiling it in some way.\"</p> <p> To its credit, the AI Lab allowed Staliman to continue to use its computers, and to sleep in his former office at 545 Tech Square for twelve years. He was even registered to vote at that address. Stallman did retain one significant moment of those happy times: his log - in ID. To this day he signs himself \"rms,\" his original username for the ITS machine, and most of the hacker world knows him by these initials.</p> <p> Although Stallman says that he lived cheaply - I would have done so for the sake of this project, but I'd always lived cheaply,\" money was an obvious concern in those early days of GNU. \"I didn't know at the beginning whether I would have any sources of income,\" he recalls, though \"for the first year I think I was paid by LMI to update some manuals from MIT.\" In any case, \"the point is.\" he says. \"I was utterly determined to do this; nothing could have intimidated me at that point.\"</p> <p> Fortunately, selling GNU Emacs for $150 a tape - \"I just thought it would be a good price,\" he explains - soon provided him with a steady income. \"By the middle of the year, I was getting some eight to ten orders a month and that was enough for me to live on [although] I couldn't have saved any money from that alone.\"</p> <p> With GNU Emacs out of the way, and perhaps encouraged by its reception and the money he was starting to receive from it, Stallman turned his thoughts to the other projects, including that problematic C compiler. This time, he decided he would not try to adapt a pre - existing program, but would write it all himself. It proved a hugely complex project. \"It was the most challenging program I've ever written.\" he says simply. \"It's one that required me to write plans down on paper rather than just code.\"</p> <p> Stallman's general approach to coding is quite different. \"I start with a sort of vague idea in my head,\" he says, \"and I find some part of the job I can write, and then having written one part will enable me to envision neighboring parts enough that I can write them; and then I basically go through and end up having written the whole thing.\" This probably explains in part why Unix was so attractive as a model for his GNU' project: Its use of many small elements meant that Stallman could \"find some part of the job\" he could write - a utility here, a program there - and then \"basically go through and end up having written the whole thing.\"</p> <p> Stallman called his compiler GCC - for GNU C Compiler. Even more than GNU Emacs, it helped spread the word about the GNU project because GCC proved to be top - class software. \"There was a period of a few years when GCC was pretty much the best compiler available for most of the systems it supported,\" he recalls. \"But that wasn't immediate, it took a while of working on optimization before it got to be the best.\" As with Emacs, this optimization was helped enormously by the comments Stallman received from users once the program was released.</p> <p> The new GCC also boosted his income further. It \"opened up the possibilities of commissions a lot more. People were more interested in commissioning changes in GCC, and in commissioning classes about GCC, than they were doing similar things for Emacs.\" Stallman says. \"I was very glad to have that source of income, especially when the Free Software Foundation was formed. I think it was October 1985; it took over from me the business of selling Emacs tapes, so I didn't have that income any more.\"</p> <p> The Free Software Foundation (FSF) represented an important step forward for GNU. \"When I started it out, it didn't have the money to hire anyone. Then it had money to hire one person, and it hired one person,\" he explains. \"The point is just that that enabled us to do more work at the same time because there were lots and lots of programs that were missing.\" Gradually, more of these programs were written, either by Stallman himself or by the growing band of FSF staff and volunteers. \"In the earliest years [there were just] two or three people [helping],\" he remembers; \"by the later 80s, I'd expect there were somewhere between thirty and fifty people.\"</p> <p> Two of the other big projects were to create a shell program and a C library. A shell provides the basic interface to the operating system: \"If you want to be able to type any commands, you need a shell,\" say's Stallman. GNU's program is called Bash, which is short for Bourne Again Shell, a play on the Unix shell called the Bourne shell.</p> <p> The C library is a chunk of auxiliary code that other programs can call. By separating out an entire set of commonly used functions in this way, user programs can be much smaller. Creating a C library for GNU was therefore a key prerequisite before the GNU operating system could run such user programs and do something useful.</p> <p> Both the C library and Bash were finished around 1990, along with many other elements of the Unix operating system. Still missing, though, in many ways the single most important program of all: the kernel. As its name suggests, the kernel sits at the very heart of the operating system. It acts as housekeeper (handling tasks such as the screen and keyboard) and judge (ensuring that all the competing calls for attention from user programs are handled correctly). Although many other programs are indispensable for a fully functional operating system - for example a C library and a shell - it is the kernel that defines its essence.</p> <p> That Stallman had left the kernel until last might seem strange given its central nature. In part it was because he had been distracted by his feud with Tanenbaum and his vow that a C compiler would be one of the first programs that he wrote for his GNU system. In addition, it made sense to develop all the programming tools first so that they could then be used in the creation of the kernel.</p> <p> There was another reason, however. \"I was trying to bypass the hardest part of the job.\" Stallman says. Debugging kernels is difficult because the standard programming tools depend on a functioning kernel. To get round this, Stallman had been on the lookout once more for suitable software that could be adapted - and he had something particular in mind: \"I was looking for a microkernel\" he says.</p> <p> A microkernel is a kernel that takes the idea of a small, central adjudicating piece of software to its logical conclusion; it makes all the other housekeeping tasks normally found in a kernel into programs that are controlled just like end-user applications such as word processing and spreadsheets. The pros and cons of this approach with respect to the classic all-in-one kernel - known as a monolithic kernel - form the subject of what hackers call a \"religious war\" between their respective adherents that rages to this day.</p> <p> Stallman was interested in microkernels not for reasons of doctrine but because, he says, \"that way we could avoid the job of debugging the part of the software that runs on the bare machine\" - the underlying hardware. As usual, he was sensibly trying to save time and effort by taking existing code that had tackled one of the harder parts and building on it. He also thought the design provided some \"nice features.\"</p> <p> Stallman was lucky - or so he thought at the time. \"Eventually we found a microkernel that at least was supposedly already developed and working,\" he says, \"and we just had to write the user programs [that] do the jobs . . . normally done by parts of the kernel\" to create that missing heart of the GNU operating system, which was dubbed the GNU Hurd.</p> <p> Unfortunately, the microkernel he found \"wasn't already working totally reliably,\" as he had believed. Moreover, eliminating all the errors from this code proved much more difficult than expected. \"It turns out that the debugging environment we had was hard.\" he explains. \"In effect, the problem with this was it was a research project, and in general my policy was to avoid research projects [and] use tried-and-true designs, because a research project is risky. You may try out an idea and find that it doesn't work very well. Anyway, we tried out this design, and found out that it was hard to get it finished.\"</p> <p> In fact, \"in retrospect, it seems that developing a monolithic kernel would have been maybe faster and easier and might have been the right thing to do\" - the first working version of the Hurd wasn't released until 1996. But Stallman is philosophical about the matter: \"You see,\" he says, \"any individual software project is just a piece of the GNU project; the GNU project isn't fundamentally about developing this piece of software or that piece of software. GNU, like any operating system, is a collection of many programs. We wrote some, and we obtained some from elsewhere; in the end, we achieved the overall goal of a complete free system.\"</p> <p> As Stallman began writing the components of his GNU operating system and released them to the public, one of his primary concerns was to ensure that the programs he and his fellow coders were creating would remain free and open as they were passed on from user to user; simply putting them in the public domain would not achieve this because someone could easily come along and sell the GNU programs as proprietary products. Stallman needed to do something new and radical, namely, to draw up a software license that did not restrict the user's rights, as most did, but that protected them.</p> <p> He did this first with the GNU Emacs General Public License, in 1985. \"I worked with a lawyer to draw it up,\" he says; he had to make sure that the freedoms he was trying to perpetuate were watertight legally. Under this new \"copyleft\" - as opposed to copyright - users could copy the program, modify it, and sell the original or the modified versions. They could not modify the rights granted by the copyleft to any user, however; for example, software based on the program they sold had also to be freely available. Similarly, modifications they made to a copylefted program had to be copylefted - and so freely available. Furthermore, if software released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) were combined with proprietary (nonfree) code, the resultant combination had to be released under the GPL. In other words, the GNU GPL \"converted\" software it was used with to its own license, an extraordinarily clever approach to propagating freedom.</p> <p> This first GNU Emacs General Public License (GPL) was followed later by a GCC GPL and a similar license for several other GNU programs. But Stallman realized that this piecemeal approach was not only inelegant (a cardinal sin among hackers) but also inconvenient because it blocked certain uses. For example. \"you couldn't take code from one [program released under a GPL license] and put it in another.\" Stallman explains, \"so I decided that we had better have a single license that could be used for all of them.\" This was the GNU General Public License - what Stallman calls \"the subroutinised license\" because \"you could drop it verbatim into any program and it would apply,\" just as programming subroutines can be dropped into other code to save time - and boost their elegance.</p> <p> Stallman's intent in crafting the GNU GPL was to protect the newly forged liberties that his GNU software embodied. But the GNU GPL had another consequence that would prove key to the success of later free software projects such as Linux.</p> <p> The freedom to modify a GNU GPL program means that the source code for copylefted software must be available: If the binaries only - the sequence of 0s and 1s - are supplied, modifying the program is impractical and therefore breaches the license. Part of the GNU GPL's effect is therefore to ensure that the source is always available for a program; this is vital if others are to adapt and - especially - improve the program. More - over, the GNU GPL also ensures that such improvements must be freely available, along with their source code, to enable the community as a whole to benefit from the collective advances of all users.</p> <p> It also minimizes duplication of effort. Once a program carrying out a function is released under copyleft, others can then take this work for granted when they write similar software. There is no need to reinvent the wheel every time a particular type of program is written as is the case with commercial software.</p> <p> Stallman created in the GNU GPL a kind of written constitution for the hacker world that enshrined basic assumptions about how their community should function. In doing so, he enabled that world to progress far more efficiently than it had in the past when all these \"laws\" were unwritten. As the use of the GNU GPL became more common, so its power grew, because the more copylefted programs there are the greater the pool for future such programs to draw on; this eases their creation and the pool of GPL'd software grows yet further.</p> <p> This enormous efficiency acted as one of the main engines in driving the free software projects on to their extraordinary successes during the 1990s. For this alone, and for his work in putting together the GNU system, the computer community's debt to Stallman is immense.</p> <p> Yet for Stallman this emphasis on inherent efficiency misses the point about the GNU project and about the GNU GPL. His essential concern is freedom, and the GNU project a means to an end rather than an end in itself.</p> <p> \"The overall purpose.\" Stallman explains, \"is to give the users freedom by giving them free software they can use and to extend the boundaries of what you can do with entirely free software as far as possible. Because the idea of GNU is to make it possible for people to do things with their computers without accepting [the] domination of somebody else. Without letting some owner of software say, 'I won't let you understand how this works; I'm going to keep you helplessly dependent on me and if you share with your friends. I'll call you a pirate and put you in jail)'.\"</p> <p> \"I consider that immoral.\" Stallman continues, \"and I'm working to put an end to that way of life, because it's a way of life nobody should have to be part of, and the only way you can do that is by writing a lot of software and saying to people, 'Come, use it, share it with your friends, change it to do whatever you want it do. Join us, have fun.' And that's what GNU is for, it's to give people the alternative of living in freedom, and the individual software packages like GNU Emacs and GCC or the GNU Hurd, they're important because they're parts of getting that larger job done.\"</p> <p> Stallman has not only devoted much of his time and energy to this cause, he has given his money, too. In 1990, he won a McArthur Foundation fellowship, worth somewhere in the neighborhood of $230,000, divided into quarterly installments over five years. \"That was a lot more money than I need to live on, and more income than I had ever had before. Rather than spending it, I decided to invest most of it in mutual funds so that I can live on it for the rest of my life while working on free software or another worthy cause.\"</p> <p> He has no car: \"I live in a city where you don't need to have a car.\" He rents a room: \"I don't want to own a house, I don't want to spend a lot of money. If you spend a lot of money then you're the slave of having to make money. The money then jerks you around, controls your life.\" Stallman has never married or had children. \"That takes a lot of money. There's only one way I could have made that money, and that is by doing what I'd be ashamed of - writing nonfree software. \"If I had been developing proprietary software, I would have been spending my life building walls to imprison people.\" he believes.</p> <p> Deadly serious intensity aside, Stallman also has a lively sense of humor that manifests itself in a constant stream of ideas, puns, and hacker-type plays on words that courses through his conversations. His personal Web site carries a picture of him dressed as the outrageous be-toga'd Saint lGNUcius - a character he is happy to re-create in his travels around the world with his music CDs and a battered Toshiba portable as he gives talks whenever and wherever he can to spread his message.</p> <p> And yet many have a different image of Stallman: It is not so much playful mock saint as implacable Old Testament prophet - a kind of geek Moses bearing the GNU GPL commandments and trying to drag his hacker tribe to the promised land of freedom whether they want to go or not. His long hair, which falls thickly to his shoulders, full beard, and intense gaze doubtless contribute to the effect.</p> <p> This impression arises largely from Stallman's ability to offend even supporters through his constant refusal to compromise. \"The only reason we have a wholly free operating system is because of the movement at said we want an operating system that's wholly free, not 90 percent free,\" he says. \"If you don't have freedom as a principle, you can never see a reason not to make an exception. There are constantly going to be times when for one reason or another there's some practical convenience in making an exception.\"</p> <p> He admits that sometimes he gets tired of hammering home this message over and over again, but believes he must keep on doing it, even beyond the tolerance of most of his audiences if need be. \"I'm never sanguine. I've achieved a lot, but it's not whole job.

      "bodyText": "Once Stallman had decided on this new course of action - creating a free operating system - he soon made \"the major design decision - that we would follow Unix,\" he says. In retrospect, it might have seemed the obvious choice, but at the time this was by' no means the case because Stallman knew little about the system. \"I'd never used it,\" he says. \"I'd only read a little about it, but it seemed like it was a good, clean design [that had some] nice clean and powerful ideas.\" But the main impetus for his choice grew once again out of his experiences during the diaspora of the hacker community at the AI Lab. \"Digital had discontinued the PDP - 1O\" - the last machine on which ITS had run - \"which meant that ITS was now completely unusable on any modern computer,\" Stallman says. \"And I didn't want that kind of thing to happen again. The only way to prevent it from happening again was to write a portable system.\" Stallman wanted an operating system that could be easily transferred from one type of hardware to another. Because most operating systems had been conceived as the housekeeping software for one type of computer, portability was the exception rather than the rule. \"Unix was, at least as far as I knew, the only portable system that really had users on different kinds of computers. So it was portable not just in theory but in actual practice,\" Stallman says. Another important reason why Stallman chose Unix as his model, he explains, was that he \"decided to make the system compatible with Unix so people who had already written programs for Unix would be able to run them on this system. People who knew how to use Unix would know how to use this system without being required to learn something new.\" Once again, as he had with Emacs, he was building on something that already existed, but making it better - in this case, by creating a Unix - like system that could be shared freely Although the project was born at this most unhappy time for Stallman, the name he chose for his new project showed a typical hacker humor. His Unix work-alike would be called GNU, an acronym that stood for \"GNU'S Not Unix,\" and which thus explained itself self referentially. This kind of recursion is often used as a programming technique, and applying it to words is highly popular amongst hackers. The name GNU also proved a fruitful source of inspiration for similarly self-referential names for many of the programs that went to make up the overall GNU project. Another important virtue of Unix was that its design \"consists of a lot of small pieces, often fairly small pieces,\" Stallman explains; to create a Unix-like system, \"what you do is you just have to write each piece. So I sat down and started writing small pieces.\" Although this makes the entire process sound disarmingly simple, writing these \"small pieces\" involved reproducing work that had taken hundreds of people fifteen years - an even harder task than when Stallman matched the team of programmers at Symbolics. In his fight against that company, he was able to look at the source code - the underlying lines of programming - to help him write his own versions: hut with Unix this was not an option. \"I certainly never looked at the source code of Unix,\" Stallman says. \"Never. I once accidentally saw a file, and when I realized it was part of Unix source code, I stopped looking at it.\" The reason was simple: The source code \"was a trade secret, and I didn't want to be accused of stealing that trade secret,\" he says. \"I condemn trade secrecy, I think it's an immoral practice, but for the project to succeed, I had to work within the immoral laws that existed.\" Once again Stallman had set himself an almost impossible task that would require an exhaustive dedication and sacrifice - which was perhaps part of the attraction. \"I wasn't certain I could finish the job,\" he recalls, \"but it wasn't important for me to know whether I could finish the job; the point was I was going to start it.\" The GNU project formally began, in January 1984, when Stallman started working on a replacement for an obscure programmer's tool called Yacc. One reason he chose this was \"because there was a similar program available called Bison\" - another typical hacker pun - but it wasn't compatible with Yacc; it was missing some features.\" Stallman obtained permission from the author to make Bison compatible with Yacc, and in doing so, he put in place the first small stone of the GNU edifice. Having limbered up with this relatively minor task, Stallman moved on to one of the most important. One of the key elements of a Unix system is the C compiler. Programs written in C are text files whose contents are lines of instructions following the rules of the language. Before a computer can obey the instructions contained in the source code, they must be converted into binaries - the sequence of Os and 1s that the processor chip can understand. This is the job of the C compiler - a kind of mediator between the source code and binaries, which is therefore an indispensable tool for every C programmer. As such, it held a particular importance for Stallman in his endeavor to create a new, freely available version of Unix. A poor C compiler might seriously damage the chances of GNU's being taken seriously; equally, a great C compiler that was free would immediately make people sit up and take notice of the project. Once more, Stallman tried to build on an existing program to minimize the amount of work that needed doing, and something he had heard about seemed to be perfect for the job. The Amsterdam Compiler Kit was a powerful compiler that ran on Unix and could compile not just C but most of the languages then in use. It had been written by the U.S. academic Andrew Tanenbaum at the Free University of Amsterdam. Perhaps slightly misled by another name for the software - the Free University Compiler Kit - Stallman wrote to Tanenbaum to ask whether he could use it for his GNU project. As Stallman recalls, [Tanenbaum] said, \"The university is free; the compiler isn't. Why don't you give up that silly idea of a free system? I'd like to have some utilities to distribute with the compiler to boost sales. Contribute some utilities to me and I'll give you a share of the profits.\" What seemed eminently reasonable - generous even - to Tanenbaum, was an insult to Stallman, for whom proprietary software of the kind represented by the Amsterdam Compiler Kit was precisely what he was hoping to combat with his GNU project. Tanenbaum doesn't recall what he said exactly, but he explains why he was unable to give permission for the Amsterdam Compiler Kit (ACK) to be used by Stallman as part of GNU: \"I think we may have already signed a contract to sell ACK commercially via a company in the U.S. and one in Europe,\" he says. \"Our research group needed that money to support graduate students, etc., and as I recall, we were already committed when he came around.\" Despite these laudable aims, Stallman saw only Tanenbaum's refusal to aid him in his free software crusade. His response was identical to that he had made to Symbolics a few years earlier: He determined to write his own rival software that would match or beat the offending code. In September 1984, after an unsuccessful attempt to adapt yet another compiler, Stallman returned to his most successful program so far, Emacs. The code for this new Emacs, which became known as GNU Emacs, had \"nothing in common with the original Emacs, which was written in TECO,\" Stallman says. And in another symbolic act of return to his AI Lab roots, he decided to rewrite most of GNU Emacs in Lisp, that \"powerful and elegant language\" Stallman prized so highly. By early 1985, GNU Emacs was able to edit files, and Stallman made it available publicly. This was an important step because it represented the first time people could use and judge GNU software. Even though the free GNU operating system was almost nonexistent, people could still use Emacs: The Unix compatibility that was Stallman's constant guide meant that GNU Emacs could run on any Unix and provide him with a huge potential constituency of users. First, \"people started asking for and writing improvements, and the result was I kept working on Emacs a lot, much longer that I'd expected to, and it ended up much better than I'd originally planned on its being,\" recalls Stallman. This approach of releasing code and encouraging feedback and modifications from users, although not new - it had formed an implicit part of the entire Unix culture for year - became central to the rapid improvement of free software over the next fifteen years. Its adoption in an extreme form for the development of Linux was one of the key factors in its rapid growth and robustness. The second consequence of making Emacs available was that Stallman could sell it on tape, the standard distribution medium before floppies; this was alongside free distribution on the Internet because at that time few people had access to this fledgling medium. As well as serving users who might otherwise find it difficult to obtain copies, selling tapes bad the even more beneficial effect of giving Stallman an income. \"See,\" he says, \"I had quit my job at MIT to start the GNU project. And the reason is I wanted to make sure that MIT would not be in a position to interfere with making GNU software free in the way I wanted to do it. I didn't want to have to beg the MIT administration for permission to do this and then maybe they would insist on spoiling it in some way.\" To its credit, the AI Lab allowed Staliman to continue to use its computers, and to sleep in his former office at 545 Tech Square for twelve years. He was even registered to vote at that address. Stallman did retain one significant moment of those happy times: his log - in ID. To this day he signs himself \"rms,\" his original username for the ITS machine, and most of the hacker world knows him by these initials. Although Stallman says that he lived cheaply - I would have done so for the sake of this project, but I'd always lived cheaply,\" money was an obvious concern in those early days of GNU. \"I didn't know at the beginning whether I would have any sources of income,\" he recalls, though \"for the first year I think I was paid by LMI to update some manuals from MIT.\" In any case, \"the point is.\" he says. \"I was utterly determined to do this; nothing could have intimidated me at that point.\" Fortunately, selling GNU Emacs for $150 a tape - \"I just thought it would be a good price,\" he explains - soon provided him with a steady income. \"By the middle of the year, I was getting some eight to ten orders a month and that was enough for me to live on [although] I couldn't have saved any money from that alone.\" With GNU Emacs out of the way, and perhaps encouraged by its reception and the money he was starting to receive from it, Stallman turned his thoughts to the other projects, including that problematic C compiler. This time, he decided he would not try to adapt a pre - existing program, but would write it all himself. It proved a hugely complex project. \"It was the most challenging program I've ever written.\" he says simply. \"It's one that required me to write plans down on paper rather than just code.\" Stallman's general approach to coding is quite different. \"I start with a sort of vague idea in my head,\" he says, \"and I find some part of the job I can write, and then having written one part will enable me to envision neighboring parts enough that I can write them; and then I basically go through and end up having written the whole thing.\" This probably explains in part why Unix was so attractive as a model for his GNU' project: Its use of many small elements meant that Stallman could \"find some part of the job\" he could write - a utility here, a program there - and then \"basically go through and end up having written the whole thing.\" Stallman called his compiler GCC - for GNU C Compiler. Even more than GNU Emacs, it helped spread the word about the GNU project because GCC proved to be top - class software. \"There was a period of a few years when GCC was pretty much the best compiler available for most of the systems it supported,\" he recalls. \"But that wasn't immediate, it took a while of working on optimization before it got to be the best.\" As with Emacs, this optimization was helped enormously by the comments Stallman received from users once the program was released. The new GCC also boosted his income further. It \"opened up the possibilities of commissions a lot more. People were more interested in commissioning changes in GCC, and in commissioning classes about GCC, than they were doing similar things for Emacs.\" Stallman says. \"I was very glad to have that source of income, especially when the Free Software Foundation was formed. I think it was October 1985; it took over from me the business of selling Emacs tapes, so I didn't have that income any more.\" The Free Software Foundation (FSF) represented an important step forward for GNU. \"When I started it out, it didn't have the money to hire anyone. Then it had money to hire one person, and it hired one person,\" he explains. \"The point is just that that enabled us to do more work at the same time because there were lots and lots of programs that were missing.\" Gradually, more of these programs were written, either by Stallman himself or by the growing band of FSF staff and volunteers. \"In the earliest years [there were just] two or three people [helping],\" he remembers; \"by the later 80s, I'd expect there were somewhere between thirty and fifty people.\" Two of the other big projects were to create a shell program and a C library. A shell provides the basic interface to the operating system: \"If you want to be able to type any commands, you need a shell,\" say's Stallman. GNU's program is called Bash, which is short for Bourne Again Shell, a play on the Unix shell called the Bourne shell. The C library is a chunk of auxiliary code that other programs can call. By separating out an entire set of commonly used functions in this way, user programs can be much smaller. Creating a C library for GNU was therefore a key prerequisite before the GNU operating system could run such user programs and do something useful. Both the C library and Bash were finished around 1990, along with many other elements of the Unix operating system. Still missing, though, in many ways the single most important program of all: the kernel. As its name suggests, the kernel sits at the very heart of the operating system. It acts as housekeeper (handling tasks such as the screen and keyboard) and judge (ensuring that all the competing calls for attention from user programs are handled correctly). Although many other programs are indispensable for a fully functional operating system - for example a C library and a shell - it is the kernel that defines its essence. That Stallman had left the kernel until last might seem strange given its central nature. In part it was because he had been distracted by his feud with Tanenbaum and his vow that a C compiler would be one of the first programs that he wrote for his GNU system. In addition, it made sense to develop all the programming tools first so that they could then be used in the creation of the kernel. There was another reason, however. \"I was trying to bypass the hardest part of the job.\" Stallman says. Debugging kernels is difficult because the standard programming tools depend on a functioning kernel. To get round this, Stallman had been on the lookout once more for suitable software that could be adapted - and he had something particular in mind: \"I was looking for a microkernel\" he says. A microkernel is a kernel that takes the idea of a small, central adjudicating piece of software to its logical conclusion; it makes all the other housekeeping tasks normally found in a kernel into programs that are controlled just like end-user applications such as word processing and spreadsheets. The pros and cons of this approach with respect to the classic all-in-one kernel - known as a monolithic kernel - form the subject of what hackers call a \"religious war\" between their respective adherents that rages to this day. Stallman was interested in microkernels not for reasons of doctrine but because, he says, \"that way we could avoid the job of debugging the part of the software that runs on the bare machine\" - the underlying hardware. As usual, he was sensibly trying to save time and effort by taking existing code that had tackled one of the harder parts and building on it. He also thought the design provided some \"nice features.\" Stallman was lucky - or so he thought at the time. \"Eventually we found a microkernel that at least was supposedly already developed and working,\" he says, \"and we just had to write the user programs [that] do the jobs . . . normally done by parts of the kernel\" to create that missing heart of the GNU operating system, which was dubbed the GNU Hurd. Unfortunately, the microkernel he found \"wasn't already working totally reliably,\" as he had believed. Moreover, eliminating all the errors from this code proved much more difficult than expected. \"It turns out that the debugging environment we had was hard.\" he explains. \"In effect, the problem with this was it was a research project, and in general my policy was to avoid research projects [and] use tried-and-true designs, because a research project is risky. You may try out an idea and find that it doesn't work very well. Anyway, we tried out this design, and found out that it was hard to get it finished.\" In fact, \"in retrospect, it seems that developing a monolithic kernel would have been maybe faster and easier and might have been the right thing to do\" - the first working version of the Hurd wasn't released until 1996. But Stallman is philosophical about the matter: \"You see,\" he says, \"any individual software project is just a piece of the GNU project; the GNU project isn't fundamentally about developing this piece of software or that piece of software. GNU, like any operating system, is a collection of many programs. We wrote some, and we obtained some from elsewhere; in the end, we achieved the overall goal of a complete free system.\" As Stallman began writing the components of his GNU operating system and released them to the public, one of his primary concerns was to ensure that the programs he and his fellow coders were creating would remain free and open as they were passed on from user to user; simply putting them in the public domain would not achieve this because someone could easily come along and sell the GNU programs as proprietary products. Stallman needed to do something new and radical, namely, to draw up a software license that did not restrict the user's rights, as most did, but that protected them. He did this first with the GNU Emacs General Public License, in 1985. \"I worked with a lawyer to draw it up,\" he says; he had to make sure that the freedoms he was trying to perpetuate were watertight legally. Under this new \"copyleft\" - as opposed to copyright - users could copy the program, modify it, and sell the original or the modified versions. They could not modify the rights granted by the copyleft to any user, however; for example, software based on the program they sold had also to be freely available. Similarly, modifications they made to a copylefted program had to be copylefted - and so freely available. Furthermore, if software released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) were combined with proprietary (nonfree) code, the resultant combination had to be released under the GPL. In other words, the GNU GPL \"converted\" software it was used with to its own license, an extraordinarily clever approach to propagating freedom. This first GNU Emacs General Public License (GPL) was followed later by a GCC GPL and a similar license for several other GNU programs. But Stallman realized that this piecemeal approach was not only inelegant (a cardinal sin among hackers) but also inconvenient because it blocked certain uses. For example. \"you couldn't take code from one [program released under a GPL license] and put it in another.\" Stallman explains, \"so I decided that we had better have a single license that could be used for all of them.\" This was the GNU General Public License - what Stallman calls \"the subroutinised license\" because \"you could drop it verbatim into any program and it would apply,\" just as programming subroutines can be dropped into other code to save time - and boost their elegance. Stallman's intent in crafting the GNU GPL was to protect the newly forged liberties that his GNU software embodied. But the GNU GPL had another consequence that would prove key to the success of later free software projects such as Linux. The freedom to modify a GNU GPL program means that the source code for copylefted software must be available: If the binaries only - the sequence of 0s and 1s - are supplied, modifying the program is impractical and therefore breaches the license. Part of the GNU GPL's effect is therefore to ensure that the source is always available for a program; this is vital if others are to adapt and - especially - improve the program. More - over, the GNU GPL also ensures that such improvements must be freely available, along with their source code, to enable the community as a whole to benefit from the collective advances of all users. It also minimizes duplication of effort. Once a program carrying out a function is released under copyleft, others can then take this work for granted when they write similar software. There is no need to reinvent the wheel every time a particular type of program is written as is the case with commercial software. Stallman created in the GNU GPL a kind of written constitution for the hacker world that enshrined basic assumptions about how their community should function. In doing so, he enabled that world to progress far more efficiently than it had in the past when all these \"laws\" were unwritten. As the use of the GNU GPL became more common, so its power grew, because the more copylefted programs there are the greater the pool for future such programs to draw on; this eases their creation and the pool of GPL'd software grows yet further. This enormous efficiency acted as one of the main engines in driving the free software projects on to their extraordinary successes during the 1990s. For this alone, and for his work in putting together the GNU system, the computer community's debt to Stallman is immense. Yet for Stallman this emphasis on inherent efficiency misses the point about the GNU project and about the GNU GPL. His essential concern is freedom, and the GNU project a means to an end rather than an end in itself. \"The overall purpose.\" Stallman explains, \"is to give the users freedom by giving them free software they can use and to extend the boundaries of what you can do with entirely free software as far as possible. Because the idea of GNU is to make it possible for people to do things with their computers without accepting [the] domination of somebody else. Without letting some owner of software say, 'I won't let you understand how this works; I'm going to keep you helplessly dependent on me and if you share with your friends. I'll call you a pirate and put you in jail)'.\" \"I consider that immoral.\" Stallman continues, \"and I'm working to put an end to that way of life, because it's a way of life nobody should have to be part of, and the only way you can do that is by writing a lot of software and saying to people, 'Come, use it, share it with your friends, change it to do whatever you want it do. Join us, have fun.' And that's what GNU is for, it's to give people the alternative of living in freedom, and the individual software packages like GNU Emacs and GCC or the GNU Hurd, they're important because they're parts of getting that larger job done.\" Stallman has not only devoted much of his time and energy to this cause, he has given his money, too. In 1990, he won a McArthur Foundation fellowship, worth somewhere in the neighborhood of $230,000, divided into quarterly installments over five years. \"That was a lot more money than I need to live on, and more income than I had ever had before. Rather than spending it, I decided to invest most of it in mutual funds so that I can live on it for the rest of my life while working on free software or another worthy cause.\" He has no car: \"I live in a city where you don't need to have a car.\" He rents a room: \"I don't want to own a house, I don't want to spend a lot of money. If you spend a lot of money then you're the slave of having to make money. The money then jerks you around, controls your life.\" Stallman has never married or had children. \"That takes a lot of money. There's only one way I could have made that money, and that is by doing what I'd be ashamed of - writing nonfree software. \"If I had been developing proprietary software, I would have been spending my life building walls to imprison people.\" he believes. Deadly serious intensity aside, Stallman also has a lively sense of humor that manifests itself in a constant stream of ideas, puns, and hacker-type plays on words that courses through his conversations. His personal Web site carries a picture of him dressed as the outrageous be-toga'd Saint lGNUcius - a character he is happy to re-create in his travels around the world with his music CDs and a battered Toshiba portable as he gives talks whenever and wherever he can to spread his message. And yet many have a different image of Stallman: It is not so much playful mock saint as implacable Old Testament prophet - a kind of geek Moses bearing the GNU GPL commandments and trying to drag his hacker tribe to the promised land of freedom whether they want to go or not. His long hair, which falls thickly to his shoulders, full beard, and intense gaze doubtless contribute to the effect. This impression arises largely from Stallman's ability to offend even supporters through his constant refusal to compromise. \"The only reason we have a wholly free operating system is because of the movement at said we want an operating system that's wholly free, not 90 percent free,\" he says. \"If you don't have freedom as a principle, you can never see a reason not to make an exception. There are constantly going to be times when for one reason or another there's some practical convenience in making an exception.\" He admits that sometimes he gets tired of hammering home this message over and over again, but believes he must keep on doing it, even beyond the tolerance of most of his audiences if need be. \"I'm never sanguine. I've achieved a lot, but it's not whole job. The job is not finished.\" When will it be finished? \"Well, maybe never,\" he acknowledges. \"In what sense is freedom ever assured for the future? People are always going to have to work to keep a free society.\" This is the real point of the self-referential GNU's Not Unix, and of ideas like \"copyleft.\" For Stallman, free software matters not because software is special and deserves a special freedom; indeed, he acknowledges that \"there are more important issues of freedom - the issues of freedom that everybody's heard of are much more important than this: freedom of speech, freedom of the press, free assembly.\" Free software matters because all freedoms matter, and software happens to be the domain in which Stallman can contribute most. \"I don't see how I could do something more important in some other area,\" he says. Stallman's work is significant not only because it engendered many of the key elements and pioneered many of the processes that made the success of what came to be the combined GNU/Linux operating system possible but because it provides an ethical backdrop against which the entire free software and open source storey is unfolding. Stallman, too, should be seen as more than just the greatest hacker who has ever lived - which he almost certainly is. His example of unswerving dedication to lofty ideals may be too idealistic and daunting for most to follow, but it provides a yardstick of integrity against which the actions of his fellow coders, both great and not-so-great, may be judged.",

Its basic code of openness, sharing, and cooperation is starting to spread outside the confines of one or two high - tech industries. Many now believe that this potent combination of the Net with open source has more than a ghost of a chance of thriving in the current post - Microsoft era.</p> <p> <strong> The Coolest Year</strong></p> <p> If 1998 and 1999 were the worst years in Microsoft's history, 1991, by contrast, must have been a period when Bill Gates was feeling good. Windows 3.0, launched in May 1990, was a growing success; in the first year alone, 4 million copies had been shipped, a huge number for the time. In May 1991, Microsoft launched Visual Basic, a radically new way of programming that employs visual design methods rather than traditional ones based on editing test files.</p> <p> Even better, Windows 3.1 was close. Despite the point upgrade, version 3.1 represented a major advance over 3.0 in almost every way. Microsoft claimed that it contained over 1,000 enhancements. Its cool new user interface seduced almost everyone that saw it.</p> <p> When Windows 3.1 shipped in June 1992, it cemented Microsoft's dominance on the desktop. It also created a discontinuity in the software world as companies switched from DOS - based programs to those running under Windows. Microsoft was able to exploit this crossover to wrest leadership in the spreadsheet and word - processor sectors by quickly launching programs such as Excel and Word.</p> <p> Windows 3.1 was not the only major operating system nearing completion in 1991. Microsoft Windows New Technology, better known as Windows NT, had been started back in 1988 in a drive to create an enterprise - level operating system that would be as widely deployed in companies' back offices as MS - DOS and then Windows were in the front offices. The Windows NT project was headed by Dave Cutler, who had built the operating system VMS for the computer giant Digital, formerly known as DEC. VMS was a rival to Unix, another robust operating system, but was an official corporate product, unlike Unix, which had always been regarded as software for hackers. Windows NT, too, was unashamedly meant as a Unix - killer when, against expectations, Unix - - not VMS - - emerged as the leading enterprise operating system.</p> <p> NTs chances looked good. By the late 1980s, Unix was highly fragmented, each vendor offering a slightly different version; this meant that application software had to be rewritten many times, and that users were locked into the software of one supplier. Because Unix had also failed to embrace fully new wave of graphical interfaces, its solutions in this area were crude when compared with the Apple Macintosh or Microsoft Windows.

Linus Benedict Torvalds was born on 28 December 1969. Linus explains the significance of this day in his culture: \"It's special in the same way most days are special - - many days have some traditional meaning. December 28th is 'menl\u00f6sa barns dag,' which means roughly 'day of children without defects' although 'menl\u00f6s' is fairly old Swedish and a lot more poetic than 'without defect.'\"</p> <p> The name Linus was an unusual choice: \"not unheard of,\" Linus explains, \"but not exactly common\" in Finland either. The name itself has a history that stretches back to the roots of Western civilization. It is mentioned in Homer's Iliad in the original Greek form Linos, where it is associated with a song of mourning. There is also a St. Linus, who is traditionally listed as second pope after St. Peter. Another famous Linus - - though better - known for his last name - - is the American inventor Linus Yale.</p> <p> But rather than any of these, Linus was named in part after the U.S. scientist Linus Pauling, who received two Nobel Prizes: one for chemistry, and one for peace. \"I think I was named equally for Linus the peanut - cartoon character,\" Linus adds, and notes that this makes him \"a mix of 50 percent Nobel - prize - winning chemist and blanket - carrying cartoon character.\"</p> <p> Torvalds is a rare surname: \"There are probably something like twenty five people in the world with that last name,\" Linus says. \"Torvald\" is \"a rather old-fashioned Nordic name,\" Linus explains. \"You'll find it in Sweden and Norway. The genitive 's' is unusual, an old way of turning a regular name into the name of a farmstead - - and from there into a surname.\" Linus explains that it was his paternal grandfather \"who took the name for personal reasons, namely, that he didn't like his family.\" As a result, he says, \"to my knowledge, all Torvalds in the whole world are [his] descendants.\" In other words, one of the most famous names in computing is \"completely made up, and not more than two generations ago.\"</p> <p> The Torvalds clan is notable not just for its unusually small size: A surprising number of them are journalists. Linus runs down the list: \"My dad, Nils Torvalds: reporter for Finnish radio. His brother, my uncle, Jan Torvalds: Finnish TV. My paternal grandfather - - the founder of the Torvalds clan, deceased - - used to be a newspaper reporter, writer, and poet. My mom: Mikke (Anna) Torvalds: working at the Finnish News Agency too, but is moving more towards books and films.\"</p> <p> The Torvalds family formed part of the Swedish - speaking community in Finland, about 300,000 strong in a total population of 5 million. That their mother tongue has nothing in common linguistically with the Finnish language that surrounds them has doubtless helped them become a very close - knit group. Reflecting this, Swedish speakers themselves call this society within society \"Ankdammen\" - the Duck Pond. One of Linus's friends from Helsinki, future fellow hacker Lars Wirzenius, says, \"Almost all Swedish-speaking people know lots of other Swedish-speaking people, and the end result is that everyone either knows everyone, or knows someone who knows someone.\"</p> <p> Growing up as a member of the Duck Pond, Linus spoke Swedish at home and with family friends, and only started learning Finnish when he was five. Contact with English, which would become a crucially important factor in his work, came a few years later.</p> <p> It was around the same time that he first encountered a computer. Linus explains that his maternal grandfather was a statistician at Helsinki University; he bought a Commodore Vic - 20 microcomputer, \"one of the first ones to get on the market, at least in Finland.\" He adds, \"It wasn't exactly what you'd call a number-cruncher today, but it was certainly faster than any calculator.\" The speed of the processor was just 1 Megahertz (MHz), a thousandth of that of modern PCs.</p> <p> Linus recalls, \"I had the Vic for five years because I couldn't afford to upgrade. I programmed in Basic, maybe the first two years.\" But Linus soon moved on from this popular beginner's programming language to something more demanding: assembly language.</p> <p> Assembly language commands are easier for the computer to act on but harder for programmers to think in. \"I kind of got used to doing stuff myself by reading books about assembly language,\" he says. \"I didn't know about assemblers,\" program that make writing assembly language code easier, \"so I had to do it by hand; after a few years I essentially had to upgrade because everybody else had better machines.\"</p> <p> Linus goes on to add another reason for buying a new computer: \"I was getting to know the Vic too well.\" Throughout his computing life, Linus would search for new programming challenges, but it is interesting to see this trait emerge so early.</p>",

      "bodyText": "As a result, the open source movement poses a challenge not just to Microsoft but to the entire software industry. And perhaps beyond. For as the Internet moves ever closer to the heart of the modern world, it inevitably carries with it the free programs that drive it, and seeds the values that led to their creation. Its basic code of openness, sharing, and cooperation is starting to spread outside the confines of one or two high - tech industries. Many now believe that this potent combination of the Net with open source has more than a ghost of a chance of thriving in the current post - Microsoft era. The Coolest Year If 1998 and 1999 were the worst years in Microsoft's history, 1991, by contrast, must have been a period when Bill Gates was feeling good. Windows 3.0, launched in May 1990, was a growing success; in the first year alone, 4 million copies had been shipped, a huge number for the time. In May 1991, Microsoft launched Visual Basic, a radically new way of programming that employs visual design methods rather than traditional ones based on editing test files. Even better, Windows 3.1 was close. Despite the point upgrade, version 3.1 represented a major advance over 3.0 in almost every way. Microsoft claimed that it contained over 1,000 enhancements. Its cool new user interface seduced almost everyone that saw it. When Windows 3.1 shipped in June 1992, it cemented Microsoft's dominance on the desktop. It also created a discontinuity in the software world as companies switched from DOS - based programs to those running under Windows. Microsoft was able to exploit this crossover to wrest leadership in the spreadsheet and word - processor sectors by quickly launching programs such as Excel and Word. Windows 3.1 was not the only major operating system nearing completion in 1991. Microsoft Windows New Technology, better known as Windows NT, had been started back in 1988 in a drive to create an enterprise - level operating system that would be as widely deployed in companies' back offices as MS - DOS and then Windows were in the front offices. The Windows NT project was headed by Dave Cutler, who had built the operating system VMS for the computer giant Digital, formerly known as DEC. VMS was a rival to Unix, another robust operating system, but was an official corporate product, unlike Unix, which had always been regarded as software for hackers. Windows NT, too, was unashamedly meant as a Unix - killer when, against expectations, Unix - - not VMS - - emerged as the leading enterprise operating system. NTs chances looked good. By the late 1980s, Unix was highly fragmented, each vendor offering a slightly different version; this meant that application software had to be rewritten many times, and that users were locked into the software of one supplier. Because Unix had also failed to embrace fully new wave of graphical interfaces, its solutions in this area were crude when compared with the Apple Macintosh or Microsoft Windows. Windows NT, by contrast, was designed to marry the power of VMS - like operating system with the elegance and usability of Windows 3.1. But plenty was happening outside Microsoft's immediate sphere of interest. In 1991, Tim Berners-Lee, a British physicist at CERN, the European Centre for Nuclear Research, released for public use a hypertext system that he had been developing over the past two years.

He worked alone at first; then he gradually received contributions form others, including - though neither of them knew it in 1991 - Linus whose Linux program would provide the last major piece still missing from Stallman's huge software jigsaw puzzle.</p> <p> Richard Matthew Stallman was born in New York in 1953, an only child. His father owned a printing company and his mother was a teacher. He grew up on New York's West Side, and he thrived on the stimulation of living in a big city.</p> <p> Evidence of Stallman's self-assurance in computing matter and f his broad intellectual skills was evident from his view when he went to Harvard in 1970 that it would have been \"redundant\" to study computing there. \"I could learn programming by doing it, and so I decided I would use my classes to learn something else. I wanted to learn as much as possible, \"he says, and he chose mathematics and physics and his subjects. \"I loved math,\" he notes, \"I used to tell people 'Math You' is my middle name.\"</p> <p> But \"the joy that I had from being able to do programming and actually produce something\" soon became too strong, he says. \"In physics and math I could only learn things, so the pleasure of accomplishing something with the computer gradually won my interest away.\" Despite this, Stallman graduated magna cum laude in physics in 1974.</p> <p> Stallman was tremendously proud that the programs he wrote were \"useful to dome people, much more than I could feel pride in merely learning something.\" This desire to do something that helped others, perhaps deriving in part from his mother's strongly held liberal convictions, soon became one of the driving forces of his life; it would have unexpected knock - on effects in the world of software that he was only just entering.</p> <p> One of the key events during his time at Harvard occurred in1971, at the end of his freshman year, when he wandered over to a famous AI Lab. The AI Lab had become one of the world's greatest centres for research into Artificial Intelligence (AI), which endowed computers with human - like capabilities. Dealing with the magnitude of this task required the most advanced computer technology of the time, and the AI Lab attracted some of the world's best programmers.</p> <p> Although the visit in 1971 to one of the Meccas of computing appears surprisingly delayed, Stallman didn't find out about its existence until then. Moreover, he says, \"I was sort of timid, I didn't know anybody there, I didn't know how they would respond to somebody like me. But eventually I summoned up the courage to go there and see what there was.\"</p> <p> It all proved pleasantly easy. \"I went around to people, said I'd like some documentation [about their computer], and someone suggested to me, 'Well, maybe you'd like a summer job, too.' And they brought me over to somebody else who was a manager, who talked with me, and said, 'OK, we'll hire you.'\" Little did he suspect it at the time, but Stallman was about to enter a kind of hacker's paradise.</p> <p> The hot-house environment created by a tightly knit bunch of great programmers inventing and exploring the new worlds opened up by computing is vividly evoked in Steven Levy's 1984 book Hackers. Levy describes the classic hacker life: feats of virtuoso coding that ignored minor irritations like times of the day or night; sleeping on the floor of the AI Lab when exhaustion finally won out over inspiration; the countless Chinese meals, the heated conversations, the love of the word-play, the pranks. \"FUN\" was central to what might be considered the golden age of hacking; \"We had fun writing programs, we had fun playing hacks on each other,\" Stallman says. He defines the hacker spirit as \"playful cleverness.\"</p> <p> This haven of playful cleverness lasted nearly ten years after Stallman took his summer job at the AI Lab. His work consisted of adding capabilities to the operating system for the AI Lab's Digital PDP-10 mini-computer. The software was called ITS, the Incompatible Time - Sharing System - a conscious dig at the earlier Compatible Time-Sharing System, CTSS, which had been used to develop Multics, the progenitor of Unix. Although there was no real plan to his work - \"I was just going along doing my usual 'think up a feature and add it' type stuff,\" Stallman says - the result was one of the most famous and powerful pieces of software ever written. Even if today it is little known outside programming circles. It is an editor program called Emacs, which stands for Editing MACroS.</p> <p> In the text-based pre-graphical world that existed before the Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows, the editor was a fundamental program for creating and manipulating text, as central to the way people worked hen as the Web browser is for the Internet age.</p> <p> The previous editor on ITS was Called TECO, which stood for Text Editor and Corrector, and also referred to a language of the same name. \"People no longer edited by typing TECO commands, \" Stallman explains. \"Instead, people wrote large collections of TECO programs called macros, and users invoked the, across.\" The move to macros provided users with more immediate onscreen feedback. \"Emacs was designed to synthesize the best ideas of the other editors written in TECO, and make one that would replace them and have all the best characteristics and features of them all.\"</p> <p> The first Emacs was created in 1975. Initially, it was used only at MIT - \"not just within the AI Lab; there were a couple of neighbouring labs that used ITS also\" - and Emacs ran only on ITS. A year or two later, however, \"somebody ported TECO so it would work on another time-sharing system,\" Stallman recalls.</p> <p> \"Porting\" refers to the process of translating a program to work on new hardware; once TECO could run elsewhere, so could Emacs.</p> <p> As well as starting the spread of Emacs throughout the wider world, this move later had other important consequences. When he sent out copies, Stallman established an \"informal rule that anyone making improvements had to send them back\" to him. This \"informal rule,\" once crystallized, would become the basis of the entire free software movement and one of the crucial factors for its success.</p> <p> The reason for the informal requirement was that Stallman was sending copies to those outside the immediate hacker community at the AI Lab who \"didn't have experience of it at all; so I didn't take for granted that they would want to share, \" he says. And it had become increasingly obvious to him how important this sharing was to the very existence of the world he was so happy to be a part of. \"I'd though about a way of life,\" Stallman recalls. \"I wasn't the only one to think about it, but I thought more about this aspect of it than other people.\"</p> <p> The question of sharing, apparently incidental to the business of writing computer programmes, proved central to events that occurred in the early 1980s. These events not only ended the unique community that had flourished for so long at the AI Lab but drove Stallman to feats of programming probably never matched before of since. They also lead directly to Stallman's resolve to write a free Unix clone from scratch - single-handedly if need be.</p> <p> At the centre of these events was something called the Lisp Machine. The programming language Lisp (short for List Processing) is, like Emacs, little known today outside programming circles; as with Stallman's editor, Lisp enjoys a near-mythical status within that group. Stallman describes Lisp simply as \"a more powerful and elegant language than any of the others.\" If Emacs was the editor of the hackers, Lisp was their language.</p> <p> Because Lisp was so central to the computing research at the AI Lab, one of they key projects there had been the design of the Lisp Machine, a hardware system that was optimised for running Lisp programs. By allying the power of Lisp with the speed of dedicated hardware, a new generation of computing tasks could be tackled.</p> <p> The person who had designed the Lisp machine, Richard Greenblatt - described by Levy as \"the hacker's hacker\" - wanted to found a new venture. Stallman recalls that \"he wanted to make what he called a 'hacker company,' which would mean that it would be less controlled by management which was unfriendly to hackers and most companies, and it would have nicer policies in some way.</p> <p> \"One of the ideas was they wouldn't get outside investors,\" Stallman continues, \"because outside investors would insist on imposing all the usual ways of doing things that would make it ugly. And another idea was that they wouldn't just hire away the hacker's from the [AI] Lab, but would hire them part-time, so the lab would still have its hacker coacher, and the community that we belong to wouldn't be wiped out.\" But this vision was never realized.</p> <p> \"The other people [in the AI Lab] said that they didn't trust Greenblatt to run a business,\" Stallman says. As a result a company called Symbolics was formed without Greenblatt, who, undaunted, went on to set up his own, called Lisp Machine Incorporated (LMI). But as Stallman recalls, \"Symbolics had more money and hired several of the best hackers away from the Lab and a year later they hired the rest of the hackers except for me and Greenblatt. And the result was that my community was wiped out.\"</p> <p> Stallman is still moved when he recalls these events. His beloved Lab \"felt like a ghost town,\" he says. \"It was desolate, and I was grief - stricken.\"</p> <p> Not only were his friends and colleagues leaving but he was loosing ITS as a result. \"At that time, the AI Lab was buying a new computer,\" he says, \"and there were no hackers to port ITS to it\" because all the hackers had been hired away. \"Everything was dying.\"</p> <p> This turn of events might have left Stallman in despair, but he channelled his pain into an anger that would spur him on to undertake a crusade that continues to this day. He decided to fight back in the only way he knew how: by coding. As the Symbolics development team - largely the former hackers of the AI Lab - made additions to their version of the software for the Lisp Machine, Stallman set about reproducing those same features in the version of the software that the AI Lab used.</p> <p> \"I had myself taken off all mailing lists, because I wanted nothing to distract me. I knew I had to compete with a much larger army and that I would have to do the work of several people; I'd have to work in the most focused way I possibly could,\" he says.</p> <p> Because LMI and Symbolics both had the right to use features form the AI Lab's software for the Lisp machine - and Symbolics already had the new features - Stallman enabled LMI to match every move of Symbolics, and so denied Symbolics any advantage from its larger team of developers.</p> <p> Looking back Stallman says that this period beginning March 1982 saw \"absolutely\" the most intense coding he had ever done; it probably represents one of the most sustained bouts of one-person programming in history.</p> <p> \"In some ways it was very comfortable because I was doing almost nothing else,\" he says, \"and I would go to sleep whenever I felt sleepy; when I woke up I would go back to coding; and when I felt sleepy again I'd go to sleep again. I had nothing like a daily schedule. I'd sleep probably for a few hours one and half times a day, and it was wonderful; I felt more awake than I've ever felt. And I got a tremendous amount of work done [and] I did it tremendously efficiently.\" Although \"it was exhilarating sometimes, sometimes it was terribly wearying. It was in some ways terribly lonesome, but I kept doing it [and] I wouldn't let anything stop me,\" he says.</p> <p> Stallman kept up this unprecedented feat for nearly two years. But by 1983, the situation was beginning to change. On the plus side, \"LMI was getting bigger and was able to hire some programmers,\" he remembers, \"so I could see that LMI was going to be able to do this work for itself.\" But more negatively, Symbolics had designed a new kind of Lisp machine, so \"there was no hope and not much point, either, in making the MIT version of the system [software] run on those machines,\" he acknowledges.</p> <p> In hindsight, this situation provided an important demonstration of one of the key factors of the new way of developing programs that free software in general and Linux in particular would build on in the coming years. As Stallman explains, \"I could write code, but I couldn't test everything myself. Users had to find the bugs.\" Consequently, \"as the AI Lab switched over to [Symbolics' new] machines, I would lose my ability to do the job\" of producing good code for the LMI machine because nobody could test it at the Lab. 1 would have been unable to continue,\" he says.</p> <p> This development proved a blessing in disguise. \"I decided I didn't want to just continue punishing Symbolics forever. They destroyed my community; now I [wanted] to build something to replace it,\" he says. \"I decided I would develop a free operating system, and in this way lay the foundation for a new community like the one that had been wiped out.\"</p> <p> Another important consideration in all this, he recalls, was that \"the MIT Lisp Machine system was proprietary software. It was licensed by MIT to Symbolics and LMI, and I wasn't happy with that\" because the essence of proprietary software is that it cannot be shared; this stifled the formation of the kind of software community that Stallman now wished to create. Working on the MIT Lisp Machine software had in some ways revealed itself to have been a wrong turn.</p>",

      "bodyText": "One such person was Richard Stallman, who laboured for years to create a Unix - like system, written from scratch, what would be free. He worked alone at first; then he gradually received contributions form others, including - though neither of them knew it in 1991 - Linus whose Linux program would provide the last major piece still missing from Stallman's huge software jigsaw puzzle. Richard Matthew Stallman was born in New York in 1953, an only child. His father owned a printing company and his mother was a teacher. He grew up on New York's West Side, and he thrived on the stimulation of living in a big city. Evidence of Stallman's self-assurance in computing matter and f his broad intellectual skills was evident from his view when he went to Harvard in 1970 that it would have been \"redundant\" to study computing there. \"I could learn programming by doing it, and so I decided I would use my classes to learn something else. I wanted to learn as much as possible, \"he says, and he chose mathematics and physics and his subjects. \"I loved math,\" he notes, \"I used to tell people 'Math You' is my middle name.\" But \"the joy that I had from being able to do programming and actually produce something\" soon became too strong, he says. \"In physics and math I could only learn things, so the pleasure of accomplishing something with the computer gradually won my interest away.\" Despite this, Stallman graduated magna cum laude in physics in 1974. Stallman was tremendously proud that the programs he wrote were \"useful to dome people, much more than I could feel pride in merely learning something.\" This desire to do something that helped others, perhaps deriving in part from his mother's strongly held liberal convictions, soon became one of the driving forces of his life; it would have unexpected knock - on effects in the world of software that he was only just entering. One of the key events during his time at Harvard occurred in1971, at the end of his freshman year, when he wandered over to a famous AI Lab. The AI Lab had become one of the world's greatest centres for research into Artificial Intelligence (AI), which endowed computers with human - like capabilities. Dealing with the magnitude of this task required the most advanced computer technology of the time, and the AI Lab attracted some of the world's best programmers. Although the visit in 1971 to one of the Meccas of computing appears surprisingly delayed, Stallman didn't find out about its existence until then. Moreover, he says, \"I was sort of timid, I didn't know anybody there, I didn't know how they would respond to somebody like me. But eventually I summoned up the courage to go there and see what there was.\" It all proved pleasantly easy. \"I went around to people, said I'd like some documentation [about their computer], and someone suggested to me, 'Well, maybe you'd like a summer job, too.' And they brought me over to somebody else who was a manager, who talked with me, and said, 'OK, we'll hire you.'\" Little did he suspect it at the time, but Stallman was about to enter a kind of hacker's paradise. The hot-house environment created by a tightly knit bunch of great programmers inventing and exploring the new worlds opened up by computing is vividly evoked in Steven Levy's 1984 book Hackers. Levy describes the classic hacker life: feats of virtuoso coding that ignored minor irritations like times of the day or night; sleeping on the floor of the AI Lab when exhaustion finally won out over inspiration; the countless Chinese meals, the heated conversations, the love of the word-play, the pranks. \"FUN\" was central to what might be considered the golden age of hacking; \"We had fun writing programs, we had fun playing hacks on each other,\" Stallman says. He defines the hacker spirit as \"playful cleverness.\" This haven of playful cleverness lasted nearly ten years after Stallman took his summer job at the AI Lab. His work consisted of adding capabilities to the operating system for the AI Lab's Digital PDP-10 mini-computer. The software was called ITS, the Incompatible Time - Sharing System - a conscious dig at the earlier Compatible Time-Sharing System, CTSS, which had been used to develop Multics, the progenitor of Unix. Although there was no real plan to his work - \"I was just going along doing my usual 'think up a feature and add it' type stuff,\" Stallman says - the result was one of the most famous and powerful pieces of software ever written. Even if today it is little known outside programming circles. It is an editor program called Emacs, which stands for Editing MACroS. In the text-based pre-graphical world that existed before the Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows, the editor was a fundamental program for creating and manipulating text, as central to the way people worked hen as the Web browser is for the Internet age. The previous editor on ITS was Called TECO, which stood for Text Editor and Corrector, and also referred to a language of the same name. \"People no longer edited by typing TECO commands, \" Stallman explains. \"Instead, people wrote large collections of TECO programs called macros, and users invoked the, across.\" The move to macros provided users with more immediate onscreen feedback. \"Emacs was designed to synthesize the best ideas of the other editors written in TECO, and make one that would replace them and have all the best characteristics and features of them all.\" The first Emacs was created in 1975. Initially, it was used only at MIT - \"not just within the AI Lab; there were a couple of neighbouring labs that used ITS also\" - and Emacs ran only on ITS. A year or two later, however, \"somebody ported TECO so it would work on another time-sharing system,\" Stallman recalls. \"Porting\" refers to the process of translating a program to work on new hardware; once TECO could run elsewhere, so could Emacs. As well as starting the spread of Emacs throughout the wider world, this move later had other important consequences. When he sent out copies, Stallman established an \"informal rule that anyone making improvements had to send them back\" to him. This \"informal rule,\" once crystallized, would become the basis of the entire free software movement and one of the crucial factors for its success. The reason for the informal requirement was that Stallman was sending copies to those outside the immediate hacker community at the AI Lab who \"didn't have experience of it at all; so I didn't take for granted that they would want to share, \" he says. And it had become increasingly obvious to him how important this sharing was to the very existence of the world he was so happy to be a part of. \"I'd though about a way of life,\" Stallman recalls. \"I wasn't the only one to think about it, but I thought more about this aspect of it than other people.\" The question of sharing, apparently incidental to the business of writing computer programmes, proved central to events that occurred in the early 1980s. These events not only ended the unique community that had flourished for so long at the AI Lab but drove Stallman to feats of programming probably never matched before of since. They also lead directly to Stallman's resolve to write a free Unix clone from scratch - single-handedly if need be. At the centre of these events was something called the Lisp Machine. The programming language Lisp (short for List Processing) is, like Emacs, little known today outside programming circles; as with Stallman's editor, Lisp enjoys a near-mythical status within that group. Stallman describes Lisp simply as \"a more powerful and elegant language than any of the others.\" If Emacs was the editor of the hackers, Lisp was their language. Because Lisp was so central to the computing research at the AI Lab, one of they key projects there had been the design of the Lisp Machine, a hardware system that was optimised for running Lisp programs. By allying the power of Lisp with the speed of dedicated hardware, a new generation of computing tasks could be tackled. The person who had designed the Lisp machine, Richard Greenblatt - described by Levy as \"the hacker's hacker\" - wanted to found a new venture. Stallman recalls that \"he wanted to make what he called a 'hacker company,' which would mean that it would be less controlled by management which was unfriendly to hackers and most companies, and it would have nicer policies in some way. \"One of the ideas was they wouldn't get outside investors,\" Stallman continues, \"because outside investors would insist on imposing all the usual ways of doing things that would make it ugly. And another idea was that they wouldn't just hire away the hacker's from the [AI] Lab, but would hire them part-time, so the lab would still have its hacker coacher, and the community that we belong to wouldn't be wiped out.\" But this vision was never realized. \"The other people [in the AI Lab] said that they didn't trust Greenblatt to run a business,\" Stallman says. As a result a company called Symbolics was formed without Greenblatt, who, undaunted, went on to set up his own, called Lisp Machine Incorporated (LMI). But as Stallman recalls, \"Symbolics had more money and hired several of the best hackers away from the Lab and a year later they hired the rest of the hackers except for me and Greenblatt. And the result was that my community was wiped out.\" Stallman is still moved when he recalls these events. His beloved Lab \"felt like a ghost town,\" he says. \"It was desolate, and I was grief - stricken.\" Not only were his friends and colleagues leaving but he was loosing ITS as a result. \"At that time, the AI Lab was buying a new computer,\" he says, \"and there were no hackers to port ITS to it\" because all the hackers had been hired away. \"Everything was dying.\" This turn of events might have left Stallman in despair, but he channelled his pain into an anger that would spur him on to undertake a crusade that continues to this day. He decided to fight back in the only way he knew how: by coding. As the Symbolics development team - largely the former hackers of the AI Lab - made additions to their version of the software for the Lisp Machine, Stallman set about reproducing those same features in the version of the software that the AI Lab used. \"I had myself taken off all mailing lists, because I wanted nothing to distract me. I knew I had to compete with a much larger army and that I would have to do the work of several people; I'd have to work in the most focused way I possibly could,\" he says. Because LMI and Symbolics both had the right to use features form the AI Lab's software for the Lisp machine - and Symbolics already had the new features - Stallman enabled LMI to match every move of Symbolics, and so denied Symbolics any advantage from its larger team of developers. Looking back Stallman says that this period beginning March 1982 saw \"absolutely\" the most intense coding he had ever done; it probably represents one of the most sustained bouts of one-person programming in history. \"In some ways it was very comfortable because I was doing almost nothing else,\" he says, \"and I would go to sleep whenever I felt sleepy; when I woke up I would go back to coding; and when I felt sleepy again I'd go to sleep again. I had nothing like a daily schedule. I'd sleep probably for a few hours one and half times a day, and it was wonderful; I felt more awake than I've ever felt. And I got a tremendous amount of work done [and] I did it tremendously efficiently.\" Although \"it was exhilarating sometimes, sometimes it was terribly wearying. It was in some ways terribly lonesome, but I kept doing it [and] I wouldn't let anything stop me,\" he says. Stallman kept up this unprecedented feat for nearly two years. But by 1983, the situation was beginning to change. On the plus side, \"LMI was getting bigger and was able to hire some programmers,\" he remembers, \"so I could see that LMI was going to be able to do this work for itself.\" But more negatively, Symbolics had designed a new kind of Lisp machine, so \"there was no hope and not much point, either, in making the MIT version of the system [software] run on those machines,\" he acknowledges. In hindsight, this situation provided an important demonstration of one of the key factors of the new way of developing programs that free software in general and Linux in particular would build on in the coming years. As Stallman explains, \"I could write code, but I couldn't test everything myself. Users had to find the bugs.\" Consequently, \"as the AI Lab switched over to [Symbolics' new] machines, I would lose my ability to do the job\" of producing good code for the LMI machine because nobody could test it at the Lab. 1 would have been unable to continue,\" he says. This development proved a blessing in disguise. \"I decided I didn't want to just continue punishing Symbolics forever. They destroyed my community; now I [wanted] to build something to replace it,\" he says. \"I decided I would develop a free operating system, and in this way lay the foundation for a new community like the one that had been wiped out.\" Another important consideration in all this, he recalls, was that \"the MIT Lisp Machine system was proprietary software. It was licensed by MIT to Symbolics and LMI, and I wasn't happy with that\" because the essence of proprietary software is that it cannot be shared; this stifled the formation of the kind of software community that Stallman now wished to create. Working on the MIT Lisp Machine software had in some ways revealed itself to have been a wrong turn.",

Wouldn't it be refreshing if they asked for unmotivated, disorganised loners - you can but dream. http://jobs.theguardian.com/Browse/Fulltextjob/0,1755,100113055,00.html?bnr=email.grad And finally, if you have always wanted to travel the world's exhibition halls, this company is looking for events assistants who want to get into the crazy world of conferences. Got to have one year's experience but I'm sure you could talk your way in. http://jobs.theguardian.com/Browse/Fulltextjob/0,1755,100112835,00.html?bnr=email.grad",

The infected farms were in two towns, Heerde and Wapenveld, in the east of the country, already affected by the epidemic. Dutch farmers protested yesterday in Kootwijkerbroek against the mass culling of animals in angry scenes that led to 16 arrests. Today it was the turn of the French.

      "body": "<p>As everyone knows we launched a new BBC wide expenses policy at the beginning of February. As you also know this has upset quite a few people and we have received a lot of negative feedback from staff, from members of the Staff Forum and from the trades unions.</p> <p>Having listened to these views and having had further negotiations with the Inland Revenue we have decided to make a number of changes, which will take effect immediately (if expenses are not to be taxed the rates have to be approved by the Inland Revenue).</p> <p>One major change will be that instead of having one expenses policy we will have one for Resources Ltd. and one for virtually all of the rest of the BBC, including Radio Production Resources (we*ve always had separate expenses policies for BBC Worldwide and the Orchestras and these will continue).</p> <p>Our attempt to create a single policy from the 26 different ones we had before has proved too difficult. As a business competing for outside work we've come to accept that BBC Resources Ltd is subject to different commercial pressures and, as a result, needs a different policy.</p> <p>As from this year BBC Resources Ltd is free to operate its own pay policy with its staff regardless of the overall BBC pay deal, so we have decided it should have its own expenses policy as well.</p> <p>For the rest of the BBC we plan to make the following changes to the expenses policy:</p> <p>The Changes:</p> <p>The BBC has negotiated a dispensation with the Inland Revenue so that people only need to be away for 5 hours and 5 miles from their home base in order for a meal claim not to be taxable (ie the current restrictions that staff have to be more than 5 miles from any BBC base and that their home base must have canteen facilities will no longer apply);</p> <p>Also, after negotiations with the Inland Revenue, it has been agreed that for News and News Resources staff (and similar staff in Nations &amp; Regions and World Service), meals will not be taxed if they are working within 5 miles of their home base and cannot return to a BBC site for operational reasons (i.e. they are covering a story);</p> <p>Mileage rates will be increased in line with Inland Revenue changes for 2001/2002. This will only affect vehicles in the 'up to 1500cc' category, which go up 5p per mile.</p> <p>The \u00a355 hotel accommodation guidance rate is increased to \u00a365;</p> <p>Where staff are entitled to both a lunch and dinner, with prior permission, the rate for the two allowances can be combined to pay for dinner up to the value of \u00a316;</p> <p>That after 8pm, staff can now claim the higher (\u00a310 'dinner') rate if they have been on duty for more than 5 hours and are 5 miles from base;</p> <p>Staff will now be entitled to claim for a second meal 6 hours after the first - rather than after another 7 hours as the policy currently requires;</p> <p>Advances for irregular expenses will be permissible in limited circumstances.</p> <p>Those in BBC Resources Ltd should note that they will not get the increased allowances outlined above - but will have a different policy.</p> <p>The Trades Unions are being informed of these changes.</p> <p>Before anyone asks: these changes do NOT signal the end of 'One BBC'. It's worth remembering we will have reduced 26 different expenses policies down to just two.</p> <p>Full details on the new policies can be found on Gateway at http://home.gateway.bbc.co.uk/ic/items/expenses-100401.html and, later today, for BBC Resources Ltd at http://resources.gateway.bbc.co.uk/hrshared/expenses/index.html</p> <p>I hope everyone accepts that we*ve listened to the genuine concerns expressed by staff and we have changed the new policy as a result.</p> <p>Yours, Greg</p> <p>PS. I see from this weekend's papers that I am clamping down on BBC people going to awards dinners. This is certainly not the case for those who are nominated as we should celebrate our successes. However I am concerned at the ever increasing number of awards - and awards dinners - which are being created. Many of these are designed simply to make money for the organisers. The danger of creating more and more awards ceremonies is that they will undervalue the awards which do matter and which we will continue to support.</p> <p>Issued by Russell Grossman Head of Internal Communications Third Floor, London Broadcasting House LONDON W1A 1AA</p>",

      "bodyText": "As everyone knows we launched a new BBC wide expenses policy at the beginning of February. As you also know this has upset quite a few people and we have received a lot of negative feedback from staff, from members of the Staff Forum and from the trades unions. Having listened to these views and having had further negotiations with the Inland Revenue we have decided to make a number of changes, which will take effect immediately (if expenses are not to be taxed the rates have to be approved by the Inland Revenue). One major change will be that instead of having one expenses policy we will have one for Resources Ltd. and one for virtually all of the rest of the BBC, including Radio Production Resources (we*ve always had separate expenses policies for BBC Worldwide and the Orchestras and these will continue). Our attempt to create a single policy from the 26 different ones we had before has proved too difficult. As a business competing for outside work we've come to accept that BBC Resources Ltd is subject to different commercial pressures and, as a result, needs a different policy. As from this year BBC Resources Ltd is free to operate its own pay policy with its staff regardless of the overall BBC pay deal, so we have decided it should have its own expenses policy as well. For the rest of the BBC we plan to make the following changes to the expenses policy: The Changes: The BBC has negotiated a dispensation with the Inland Revenue so that people only need to be away for 5 hours and 5 miles from their home base in order for a meal claim not to be taxable (ie the current restrictions that staff have to be more than 5 miles from any BBC base and that their home base must have canteen facilities will no longer apply); Also, after negotiations with the Inland Revenue, it has been agreed that for News and News Resources staff (and similar staff in Nations &amp; Regions and World Service), meals will not be taxed if they are working within 5 miles of their home base and cannot return to a BBC site for operational reasons (i.e. they are covering a story); Mileage rates will be increased in line with Inland Revenue changes for 2001/2002. This will only affect vehicles in the 'up to 1500cc' category, which go up 5p per mile. The \u00a355 hotel accommodation guidance rate is increased to \u00a365; Where staff are entitled to both a lunch and dinner, with prior permission, the rate for the two allowances can be combined to pay for dinner up to the value of \u00a316; That after 8pm, staff can now claim the higher (\u00a310 'dinner') rate if they have been on duty for more than 5 hours and are 5 miles from base; Staff will now be entitled to claim for a second meal 6 hours after the first - rather than after another 7 hours as the policy currently requires; Advances for irregular expenses will be permissible in limited circumstances. Those in BBC Resources Ltd should note that they will not get the increased allowances outlined above - but will have a different policy. The Trades Unions are being informed of these changes. Before anyone asks: these changes do NOT signal the end of 'One BBC'. It's worth remembering we will have reduced 26 different expenses policies down to just two. Full details on the new policies can be found on Gateway at http://home.gateway.bbc.co.uk/ic/items/expenses-100401.html and, later today, for BBC Resources Ltd at http://resources.gateway.bbc.co.uk/hrshared/expenses/index.html I hope everyone accepts that we*ve listened to the genuine concerns expressed by staff and we have changed the new policy as a result. Yours, Greg PS. I see from this weekend's papers that I am clamping down on BBC people going to awards dinners. This is certainly not the case for those who are nominated as we should celebrate our successes. However I am concerned at the ever increasing number of awards - and awards dinners - which are being created. Many of these are designed simply to make money for the organisers. The danger of creating more and more awards ceremonies is that they will undervalue the awards which do matter and which we will continue to support.

Future is reported to be asking just over \u00a350m for the business, which it wants to offload after suffering a series of profit warnings a plummeting stock price. Business 2.0 is one of several \"new industry\" magazines put up for sale following the downturn in the technology and new media industries. Red Herring and the Industry Standard Europe are both believed to be talking to buyers.

      "bodyText": "The war of words between the US and China over the stranded American spy plane and its 24 crew continued today with neither side appearing willing to break the deadlock. Zhu Bangzao, a senior foreign ministry official travelling with the Chinese president, Jiang Zemin, in Argentina, repeated China's demand for an apology, which the US says is uncalled for. Mr Zhu said the US should \"respond appropriately\". He added: \"If they don't it's going to make things difficult. If they do, it's going to help resolve the problem.\" American diplomats are seeking a way to express sympathy to China's satisfaction without making an outright apology. The row erupted after a US surveillance plane collided with a Chinese fighter jet on April 1. The US plane made an emergency landing on the Chinese island of Hainan but the Chinese aircraft crashed and the pilot, who evacuated the jet, is missing presumed dead. US Brigadier General Neal Sealock's had his fifth meeting today with the 24 Americans, who US officials have been careful to avoid calling hostages. He said the crew members are aware of the stand-off that is detaining them. \"We discussed the emotions on both sides,\" he said. \"They realise it is a political situation.\" As well as seeking an apology, the Chinese government has also demand that the US halt surveillance flights near its coast. The White House said neither demand was warranted, and the US president, George Bush, warned anew last night that US-China relations could suffer without a resolution soon. \"There is a point - the longer it goes - there's a point at which our relations with China could become damaged,\" he said. Mr Bush expressed regret last Friday for the loss and presumed death of the pilot. He also sent a letter to the pilot's wife, expressing similar sentiments. The secretary of state, Colin Powell, said on Sunday the administration was \"sorry\" for the pilot's loss - the closest the US has come to an apology. China gave no direct reaction to Mr Powell's statement. Mr Bush, who is hoping to keep public and congressional support behind him, said: \"We've got every diplomatic channel open,\" but added, \"diplomacy takes time.\" Mr Bush urged patience, aiming his remarks at lawmakers who have stepped up their anti-China rhetoric and begun to question his handling of the situation. Robert Torricelli, the Democratic senator of New Jersey asked \"whether it is appropriate to have both an ambassador and hostages in the same country.\" Polls show American voters support Mr Bush's leadership on China, but senior Republicans said the goodwill could erode if the standoff continues.

      "body": "<p>Leading children's rights activists are unhappy with the way the UK is championing the rights of children. </p> <p>Despite a series of high profile inquiries into how children have been failed, campaigners say the UK lags behind mainland Europe. On the continent a growing number of countries have set up commissioners who have wide-ranging powers to protect the young.</p> <p>Campaigners want Britain to adopt the approaches of several European countries, where the work of commissioners or ombudsmen has had a major impact on the well-being of children.</p> <p>Although Wales has appointed Peter Clarke as children's commissioner there are concerns his office will lack the power to go to the heart of children's welfare. This is because he reports to the devolved assembly, which has limited powers, rather than to legislators and national policy makers at Westminster.</p> <p>England, Northern Ireland and Scotland are all examining setting up their own commissioners. But progress, say campaigners, is too slow.</p> <p>\"Opinion polls have shown overwhelming public support for a commissioner in this country. Europe has around 15 commissioners or children's ombudsmen and they all have broad powers to work on behalf of young people,\" said Peter Newell, adviser to the European Network of Ombudsmen for Children.</p> <p>\"They vary in the way the offices operate, but a common theme is that once set up by government they are left to do whatever is necessary to further the interests of children,\" he added.</p> <p>Details of how children's advocates work in practice across Europe show just how differently countries promote and defend young people's rights.</p> <p>Trond Waage, Norway's commissioner, has a permanent staff of nine advisers and his office has a major impact on policy. Norway was the first country to appoint an ombudsman for children, 20 years ago, and has given its children's advocate broad powers. These include the ability to gain access to all public and private institutions for children; the requirement that all agencies working with children give the commissioner any information he requests, and the power to ensure legislation relating to the protection of children's interests is observed. Mr Waage said: \"What is important about the role is that we take a holistic approach to the way services are provided for children. Through the inter-disciplinary team in my office we look at major issues like health, education, law and social welfare, and consider if what is being provided by the state is adequate.\" </p> <p>\"We have enormous freedom to represent children and we aim to be proactive and lead the way in Norway where children's issues are concerned. </p> <p>\"All over Europe now there are offices opening up and, of course, there are different models. But what is vital is that there is freedom to act independently on behalf of children.

      "bodyText": "Leading children's rights activists are unhappy with the way the UK is championing the rights of children. Despite a series of high profile inquiries into how children have been failed, campaigners say the UK lags behind mainland Europe. On the continent a growing number of countries have set up commissioners who have wide-ranging powers to protect the young. Campaigners want Britain to adopt the approaches of several European countries, where the work of commissioners or ombudsmen has had a major impact on the well-being of children. Although Wales has appointed Peter Clarke as children's commissioner there are concerns his office will lack the power to go to the heart of children's welfare. This is because he reports to the devolved assembly, which has limited powers, rather than to legislators and national policy makers at Westminster. England, Northern Ireland and Scotland are all examining setting up their own commissioners. But progress, say campaigners, is too slow. \"Opinion polls have shown overwhelming public support for a commissioner in this country. Europe has around 15 commissioners or children's ombudsmen and they all have broad powers to work on behalf of young people,\" said Peter Newell, adviser to the European Network of Ombudsmen for Children. \"They vary in the way the offices operate, but a common theme is that once set up by government they are left to do whatever is necessary to further the interests of children,\" he added. Details of how children's advocates work in practice across Europe show just how differently countries promote and defend young people's rights. Trond Waage, Norway's commissioner, has a permanent staff of nine advisers and his office has a major impact on policy. Norway was the first country to appoint an ombudsman for children, 20 years ago, and has given its children's advocate broad powers. These include the ability to gain access to all public and private institutions for children; the requirement that all agencies working with children give the commissioner any information he requests, and the power to ensure legislation relating to the protection of children's interests is observed. Mr Waage said: \"What is important about the role is that we take a holistic approach to the way services are provided for children. Through the inter-disciplinary team in my office we look at major issues like health, education, law and social welfare, and consider if what is being provided by the state is adequate.\" \"We have enormous freedom to represent children and we aim to be proactive and lead the way in Norway where children's issues are concerned. \"All over Europe now there are offices opening up and, of course, there are different models. But what is vital is that there is freedom to act independently on behalf of children. Without us, children's interests may be forgotten,\" Mr Waage added. Austria's federal system has a network of nine children's ombudsmen in each of the provinces. The advocates have extensive powers to represent children. The system was set up in 1989 through child welfare laws. The ombudsmen are all independent and have special privileges under the constitution that allow them to promote children's rights in a broad range of policy areas. They can defend children's interests by reviewing upcoming legislation and work to highlight the profile of children's needs. Iceland, too, has its own advocate for children, who works to ensure the rights and needs of young people are represented in all areas of everyday life. In practice, that is achieved by checking that all new laws are in accordance with children's interests, and monitoring international agreements Iceland has signed up to. The Russian federation recently joined the growing number of countries across Europe in appointing a network of federal ombudsmen. Outside Europe, New Zealand and Canada have commissioners for children, and several US states are examining the idea too. In Wales, children's groups have lobbied energetically to make sure the first children's commissioner in the UK has wide powers. Their work has been rewarded with an amendment that means the Mr Clarke will be able to consider and make representations on any matter affecting the rights or welfare of children in Wales. Prior to the amendment, it was feared that some children in Wales, particularly those detained by the Home Office, might fall outside the protection of the commissioner.

      "bodyText": "Legal experts have warned the Sunday Mirror faces a \u00a310m fine while editor Colin Myler could go to jail following its role in the collapse of the Leeds footballers' trial. London School of Economics law professor Michael Zander today warned that the Sunday Mirror article that led to the judge discharging the jury created a \"real risk\" of prejudice in delivering a verdict. It now seems inevitable the newspaper will be charged with contempt of court for publishing material that might prejudice a fair trial. Mr Zander said the Sunday Mirror faces an \"unlimited\" fine and could theoretically be forced to pay the \u00a310m cost of the trial, although that remained unlikely. \"The fine could be enormous and unlimited. I have seen reports that they could made to pay the entire bill for the case. I think that is extremely unlikely, but I think there will be a swingeing fine,\" he said. \"There is an outside probability of a prison sentence,\" he said. Even in the unlikely event the Sunday Mirror is not charged with contempt, it faces a long haul back to respectability following yesterday's events. The majority of national newspapers put the story on their front pages and openly questioned the judgement of the Sunday Mirror's editorial staff and its owner Trinity Mirror. Trinity Mirror's shares fell 3% on the London Stock Exchange this morning, amid fears that a whopping fine would cause serious damage to the company's balance sheet. The Sunday Mirror has now joined the list of newspapers that have been accused of contempt.

The BTA's \"UK is OK\" campaign is part of the government's push to lure foreign tourists, especially Americans, back to Britain in the wake of the foot and mouth crisis. Hill &amp; Knowlton, Weber Shandwick and GCI have been shortlisted to spearhead the PR campaign. The three agencies have been chosen because of their international capabilities, said a BTA spokesman. The agencies will make a final presentation to the BTA on Thursday and a decision will be made by the middle of next week. Madonna, Robbie Williams, Sir Michael Caine and Sir Elton John have all been approached by the BTA to write a paragraph endorsing the UK as part of the push to show the country is not closed for business. The appointment of a creative advertising agency to work on trumpeting the UK as a holiday destination will not be made until the foot and mouth crisis abates.

But now the producers of Survivor are battling against what they claim is a poor imitation of their hit American show. Survivor's US producer and broadcaster are suing the company behind rival show Boot Camp, alleging it is a rip-off. Survivor Productions and the CBS network have filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against Boot Camp broadcaster Fox and producer LMNO. \"Aside from its military setting, the premise and format of Boot Camp are virtually identical to Survivor,\" the lawsuit claims. Richard Messick, the former Survivor producer who is now working for LMNO as executive producer of Boot Camp, is also named in the lawsuit, which was filed yesterday with a court in California. Former Planet 24 owners Lord Alli, Charlie Parsons and Bob Geldof hold the rights to the Survivor format through their company Castaway Television Productions. Last year Mr Parsons had a law suit alleging a similar copywright infringement against Big Brother creator Endemol thrown out of the Dutch courts. But the former Planet 24 owners are not thought to be directly involved in the Survivor lawsuit launched in the US yesterday. The Boot Camp format was originally created by Granada Media, which sold the US rights to LMNO. The US production outfit developed the idea further and sold it on to Fox. The runaway ratings success of Castaway on CBS last summer kick-started the reality TV boom in the US, with 50m tuning for the finale when Richard Hatch won \u00a3700,000. The Castaway format features 16 contestants on a remote island competing in a series of mental and physical tests and voting each other off the show, until a winner emerges. An eight-part series of Boot Camp premiered on Fox last month with an impressive 23m viewers. The show is to be screened on Sky One in the UK. Boot Camp has 16 contestants put through a series of tests by drill instructors over several weeks, with the participants voting each other out and being whittled down until a winner of the \u00a3350,000 cash prize emerges. Last week the owner of the Popstars format threatened to take legal action against Pop Idol creators Pearson TV over alleged similarities between the two shows.

Yesterday, the Bush administration unveiled its budget, setting out its domestic agenda. It is already in trouble. President Bush's budget fleshes out how he intends to finance his previously-stated plans to slash taxes by $1.6bn (\u00a31.1bn). There will be increases in education and defence - where money will be needed for the much-touted and controversial national missile defence system - but these will be offset by large cuts in areas such as healthcare, agriculture and transport. And, having repudiated the Kyoto accord on global warming, the Bush administration could bar spending on the implementation of the treaty and also cut spending on energy conservation and environmental protection. The assault on the Clinton legacy has begun in earnest. As the governor of Texas, Mr Bush prided himself on being able to forge deals with his democratic opponents, and that was one of his major selling points during the election campaign.

      "bodyText": "Reuters has performed an about-turn and admitted an interest in bidding for parts of rival financial news service Bridge Information Systems. The company said in a statement it was \"considering submitting a bid\" for certain assets of its US competitor, which recently filed for bankruptcy after building up debts of more than \u00a3500m. Tom Glocer, chief executive of Reuters, told analysts two months ago that Bridge had not improved in \"attractiveness\" but has since changed his stance. Analysts gave the thumbs-up to the move, saying Bridge would bolster Reuters's weak position in the US and remove its biggest rival in the financial information business. Although Reuters is a pioneer in the financial information business - and created the electronic trading markets that are used today - it faces increasing competition in a flat market. The group aims to grow revenues in its core financial information business by up to 10% this year. The acquisition of Bridge's best assets could improve the chances of meeting that target.

It adds: \"In a world of partnerships, zones and area-based initiatives, there can be a real problem for accountability if citizens do not know who is responsible for the programmes that impact upon them.\" The committee recommends a royal commission to review the civil service. The report will add impetus to a Whitehall review, already underway, that is understood to be considering setting up new government departments for the elderly, social exclusion, and work and family.",

      "bodyText": "Millions of British holidaymakers are flocking to book holidays abroad in the wake of the foot and mouth crisis as Tony Blair struggles to lure foreign tourists back to the UK. The Association of British Travel Agents said nearly 1.75m British holidaymakers were set to leave the country over the Easter weekend. Many holiday operators have sold out of Easter holidays and summer bookings are very well advanced. Sales of walking holidays abroad have reached unprecedented levels at Thomson Holidays, at a time when British walkers are frustrated by having to stick to roads in the countryside. \"We have sold out for Easter, and July and August are selling extremely well. Walking holidays have hit the roof. Interest has been much higher than last year,\" said a Thomson Holidays spokesman. First Choice reports record sales for the summer and is advising holidaymakers to book as early as possible. A spokeswoman for First Choice said it was difficult to put the bookings increase down to the foot and mouth crisis alone, but if the crisis continued it would have a significant effect. \"Foot and mouth will contribute to the increase in foreign holiday bookings if things continue as they are,\" said an ABTA spokesman. He said the number of British holidaymakers travelling abroad has steadily increased for the past 10 years, but a quarter of a million more people than last year were travelling abroad for Easter. Eurostar trains are almost fully booked for the Easter weekend. Half a million Brits are expected to travel under or over the English Channel to France, the Netherlands and Spain.

Neither of us could have predicted that Development Hell would be extended to create a special room just for me. </p> <p>What is Development Hell? It's the place you get to after a film producer takes you up to a high place and shows you the world. You sign a contract giving the producer the right to make a film from your book and then you enjoy a variety of torments - another writer, or 10, may \"fashion\" a screenplay, a producer, or 10, may come in on the deal, your story is relocated to the nearest tax haven, your characters change race, gender and political symbolism, the casting ambitions that began with Russell Crowe refocus on Rick Moranis. Your chances of progressing to pre-production purgatory are one in 200. </p> <p>A couple of years ago I wrote a novel called Heartswap and sent it to my agent, Jonathan Lloyd. It was my first full-on comedy, about two girls who set their guys a fidelity test, the plot of the opera Cosi Fan Tutte with the genders switched, relocated to millennial London. Two Christmases ago, Jonathan called to tell me that the agency's media supremo, Nick Marston, had decided the story had film potential. Christmas happened, I went to parties, met a successful British film producer and told him about my book, which he asked to see. </p> <p>I relayed his interest to Nick, who explained that my book was going directly to Hollywood with no side trips to British producers. Heartswap went to CAA, Creative Artists Agency, an awesome pantheon of talent. After a month an email from CAA proposed a submission list of producers and actors. Then Nick was on the phone. </p> <p>Friday, 3pm: Cruise-Wagner, Tom Cruise's production company, wanted the story for Nicole Kidman and had made a pre-emptive bid! CAA were rushing the book out. Friday, 9pm: Oprah Winfrey and Demi Moore were interested! Monday, 3pm: Cruise-Wagner upped their offer. Bidding continued until 4pm Thursday, when Heartswap was sold to Cruise-Wagner. The following Monday we were on the front page of Variety. In May the book was published and in June word came from LA that Peter Hedges, the writer of What's Eating Gilbert Grape, was doing the screenplay. Nicole Kidman and Peter Hedges are both CAA clients. When I told the British producer what had become of the book he'd asked to see, he was a little bitter. </p> <p>Eight months later, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman announced their separation and I'm the first guest in the new Tom &amp; Nicole Suite in Development Hell. If human pain weren't involved, there'd be something piquant, in a Spencer Tracy/Katherine Hepburn way, about a star and producer getting divorced and fighting a custody battle over a script. </p> <p>If you look at this story from a perspective wider than that of Hello! magazine, it dramatises a problem for the British film industry. This seems to be a boom era for British writers. Helen Fielding's Bridget Jones's Diary opens this week, Nick Hornby's High Fidelity made about $30m last year, JK Rowling's Harry Potter is taking over the world, nobody can resist Joanne Harris's Chocolat and we're eagerly awaiting Deborah Moggach's Tulip Fever, Hornby's About A Boy and Louis de Bernieres's Captain Corelli's Mandolin. </p> <p>In Hollywood these titles gained American gloss, lost European integrity and will now make money for their American backers, including Universal, which has invested in Working Title, the British company that produced Bridget Jones's Diary. Their profits will further enrich the American film industry. If it had been possible to keep these titles in the UK, and make them look something like movies, the British film industry would be ploughing back hundreds of millions of dollars. </p> <p>We may be brilliant at creating what Variety calls \"first-rate source material\" but we're crap at making it work for us. While our film industry, through the Film Council, is howling for good scripts, the most promising works by British writers are not even offered to British producers. The assumption is that British producers can't match the Americans' money. </p> <p>Film rights are bought in stages. The first level of investment by the producer is the option payment, which confers the right to develop the script and raise money on it. Option payments are small, but agents aim to get the maximum money up front as guarantee of the producer's intentions. Those intentions may not be honourable, as Jenny Colgan, now entertaining Guardian readers with her dispatches from LA, has learned. The British book that holds the record for its sojourn in Development Hell is Douglas Adams's Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy, eagerly awaited for 20 years. A producer may even buy an option to prevent a book being filmed, fearing it may damage the market for another of his or her projects. </p> <p>To help British producers compete, the Film Council has set up a Development Fund, making \u00a35m a year available for three years. \"We constantly lose out to the US because all the best-selling novels are optioned by them,\" their spokesman admits. \"Development costs cripple British producers. Paying \u00a310,000 for an option, then \u00a35,000 to \u00a38,000 for a first draft of a script, means that a producer can't afford to go any further to make the script really good.\" </p> <p>Taking an option is still a minute investment, even for a British producer; \u00a310,000, or a Hollywood-sized \u00a350,000, is nothing compared to the total cost of making a film - \u00a312m to \u00a318m in the UK, 10 times that in the US. For a writer, a story beginning with a smaller option from a sincere British producer could have a happier ending than one that began with big bucks bullshit from Hollywood. </p> <p>Film is too powerful a medium to be surrendered to market forces. Our cinema is the biggest and brightest mirror we can hold up to our nature and we need it to see who we are and what we believe. The French, whose domestic audience is the same size as ours, have never consented to see themselves through American eyes, but guarded their golden stories and pumped up commercial muscle. As a result, they can spend \u00a340m on a film and their leading producers have offices in Hollywood. </p> <p>If we are ever to have a healthy film industry, our native producers must be allowed to bid for the best material. If we can regulate the export of everything from live pigs to Canova's Three Graces, we can surely find a way to give the British movie business a fair crack at our fiction bestsellers. And no, I don't know if Tom is having a thing with Penelope Cruz, or if Nicole is. Just don't ask. </p> <p>\u0095 Celia Brayfield's Heartswap is published by Warner Books, price \u00a35.99.</p>",

Hence his willingness to put Colonel Muammar Gadafy's claim that the convicted Lockerbie bomber is innocent to Tony Blair. And, while the Americans may hold Mr Mandela in even greater reverence than he is accorded in his homeland, which does not stop him defending Washington's arch foe - Fidel Castro. But all of this is relatively straightforward compared to the most difficult task, and least noticed beyond Africa's borders, that Mr Mandela has taken on since he retired as president in 1999. His iconic status, and reputation for forgiveness and reconciliation, led him into the snake pit of Burundi's civil war. As in neighbouring Rwanda, a little more than one-tenth of Burundi's population is Tutsi. The vast majority is Hutu. But there the comparison ends. The Tutsis have ruled Burundi with a heavy and often violent hand since independence four decades ago. Free elections were eventually held in 1993, and a moderate candidate with some of Mr Mandela's qualities was elected as Burundi's first Hutu president. Within months, he was assassinated by Tutsi soldiers - almost certainly with the blessing of their superiors - and Burundi was kicked into a civil war that has cost hundreds of thousands of lives. Some call it a slow genocide, compared to the massacres in Rwanda where close to one million people died in 10 weeks. Mr Mandela was appointed mediator in 1999 after the death of the former negotiator, Tanzania's ex-president, Julius Nyerere. The South African statesman has made considerably more progress than his predecessor, who was viewed with great suspicion by the Tutsis, who he once openly likened to the 'boers'. Mr Mandela played a crucial role in persuading the Burundian military government and 18 other players to sign a framework peace accord in August after months of negotiation. But he has, so far, failed to get a key rebel group - the Forces for the Defence of Democracy (FDD) - to join the talks. The war continues, with another rebel group occupying parts of the capital, Bujumbura, for a fortnight last month. One reason for choosing Mr Mandela as mediator was the evident similarities between Burundi and the old South Africa.

Burundi is wholly different. Fear clouds every issue. The Tutsi minority is understandably loath to surrender control of the only source of protection - the army. Without domination of the military, Tutsis fear they will simply be massacred. Yet Hutus view the army as an instrument of murder and repression, particularly given its role in murdering Burundi's only elected president and the massacres that followed. Amnesty International has just released a report condemning the army and other security forces for widespread torture. Political power also means jobs. Although Afrikaners in particular among South African whites relied heavily on the state to provide employment in the apartheid years, most were still well educated enough to find their way in the private sector when the government was no longer an automatic source of jobs. In Burundi, the government is the source of almost all employment. The state provides around two-thirds of all steady work in the country, and whoever controls the government controls those jobs. Tutsis say that, to surrender political power will cost them their livelihoods and maybe even their lives. In South Africa, the majority of whites were persuaded they had more to lose than gain by clinging to an unworkable and unjust system. In Burundi, Mr Mandela has only partially succeeded in persuading a suspicious Tutsi elite of the same.

Since the National Local Government Forum Against Poverty (NLGFAP) was voluntarily wound up last year, Rotherham council has been trying to recoup \u00a3260,000 it claims it is owed by the pressure group. A new lobby group that took over from the anti-poverty forum - Local Government Against Poverty (LGAP) - claims it does not have a financial obligation to pay off the outstanding bill. The South Yorkshire authority is now seeking legal advice in pursuit of the money. Rotherham had helped finance the cost of NLGFAP, which was set up in 1994 to help local authorities develop anti-poverty strategies. It was the lead authority on the forum, and was the brainchild of Rotherham councillor Garvin Reed. The council ploughed more than \u00a3370,00 into NLGFAP, which had its headquarters in the South Yorkshire town. But in 1998, a police investigation began following allegations of a financial scandal within the forum. At one point 150 councils from throughout England, Scotland and Wales were members of NLGFAP. But as the investigation progressed when concerns mounted, authorities began to drop out. Last year, when it was decided to wind up the forum, membership had halved. LGAP succeeded NLGFAP last year with the support of around 40 councils, and it is from the new organisation that Rotherham is attempting to recover its outstanding debt. Bob Wilkinson, chairman of LGAP and a Vale of Glamorgan councillor who took over as national convenor of the old poverty forum when Mr Reed stood down, said LGAP has no financial responsibility to the council. He said: \"Who arranged for the underwriting of the forum? I didn't.

      "bodyText": "Tim Burton's remake of Planet Of The Apes has been censored. According to reports, producers 20th Century Fox have quashed a scene involving a human Mark Wahlberg and an apeish Helena Bonham Carter consummating their love. Special effects guru Rick Baker, a veteran of the Star Wars saga, told the US Daily News that Burton had: \"Wanted to have sexual tension between [the two]. Tim wanted her to be sexually attractive to [human] men.\" But when the final cut is released in cinemas, viewers will see nothing more bestial than a chaste kiss. A Fox insider told the newspaper: \"Fox thought American audiences would recoil and that the movie would get an NC-17 rating. That would kill the movie for kids.\" The studio continues to deny that it has wielded the axe over Burton's simian-human sex sequences, but a \"friend\" of Bonham Carter confirms that: \"The scene was in there originally, but the studio freaked out.\" The movie is scheduled for an August release in the UK.",

      "bodyText": "Tiger Woods is on course to become the world's first sponsorship billionaire after yesterday's historic win at Augusta's National club. The golfing star became the first person to have won four consecutive major championships when he took the US Masters yesterday. Now media pundits are predicting he will be the first person to make $1bn (\u00a3650m) from advertising and sponsorship contracts. Gene DeWitt of New York advertising agency Optimedia described Woods as \"the next mega-property\", adding: \"He's got it all, he's an athlete and a charming man. People love him and that's the most important thing.\" Woods already has a \u00a365,000 contract with Nike, which signed him up back in 1996. He also promotes Rolex watches, Titleist golf equipment and American Express and recently signed a \u00a320m deal to appear in advertising for Buick cars in the US. The golfer is even paid to talk about the company that did his corrective laser eye surgery. Tiger Woods's youthful image and down-to-earth roots have helped transform the image of the sport, breaking down its crusty reputation and making it the sport of choice among trendy youngsters. Woods's latest victory places him in the same class as all-time sporting greats Muhammed Ali and Michael Jordan. Formula One racing drivers have traditionally been by far the highest-paid sports stars. But the ever-increasing sums that even relatively unsuccessful stars such as tennis player Anna Kournikova can command through advertising and sponsorship make the amount of money earned through sport pale into insignificance. American sports magazine ESPN recently estimated Woods would earn \u00a34bn if he continued playing until the age of 65. But the magazine said only \u00a31bn of this would come from prize money, with the remaining \u00a33bn earned through endorsements.",

      "body": "<p>Once Stallman had decided on this new course of action - creating a free operating system - he soon made \"the major design decision - that we would follow Unix,\" he says. In retrospect, it might have seemed the obvious choice, but at the time this was by' no means the case because Stallman knew little about the system. \"I'd never used it,\" he says. \"I'd only read a little about it, but it seemed like it was a good, clean design [that had some] nice clean and powerful ideas.\"</p> <p> But the main impetus for his choice grew once again out of his experiences during the diaspora of the hacker community at the AI Lab. \"Digital had discontinued the PDP - 1O\" - the last machine on which ITS had run - \"which meant that ITS was now completely unusable on any modern computer,\" Stallman says. \"And I didn't want that kind of thing to happen again. The only way to prevent it from happening again was to write a portable system.\"</p> <p> Stallman wanted an operating system that could be easily transferred from one type of hardware to another. Because most operating systems had been conceived as the housekeeping software for one type of computer, portability was the exception rather than the rule. \"Unix was, at least as far as I knew, the only portable system that really had users on different kinds of computers. So it was portable not just in theory but in actual practice,\" Stallman says.</p> <p> Another important reason why Stallman chose Unix as his model, he explains, was that he \"decided to make the system compatible with Unix so people who had already written programs for Unix would be able to run them on this system. People who knew how to use Unix would know how to use this system without being required to learn something new.\" Once again, as he had with Emacs, he was building on something that already existed, but making it better - in this case, by creating a Unix - like system that could be shared freely</p> <p> Although the project was born at this most unhappy time for Stallman, the name he chose for his new project showed a typical hacker humor. His Unix work-alike would be called GNU, an acronym that stood for \"GNU'S Not Unix,\" and which thus explained itself self referentially. This kind of recursion is often used as a programming technique, and applying it to words is highly popular amongst hackers.</p> <p> The name GNU also proved a fruitful source of inspiration for similarly self-referential names for many of the programs that went to make up the overall GNU project. Another important virtue of Unix was that its design \"consists of a lot of small pieces, often fairly small pieces,\" Stallman explains; to create a Unix-like system, \"what you do is you just have to write each piece. So I sat down and started writing small pieces.\"</p> <p> Although this makes the entire process sound disarmingly simple, writing these \"small pieces\" involved reproducing work that had taken hundreds of people fifteen years - an even harder task than when Stallman matched the team of programmers at Symbolics. In his fight against that company, he was able to look at the source code - the underlying lines of programming - to help him write his own versions: hut with Unix this was not an option.</p> <p> \"I certainly never looked at the source code of Unix,\" Stallman says. \"Never. I once accidentally saw a file, and when I realized it was part of Unix source code, I stopped looking at it.\" The reason was simple: The source code \"was a trade secret, and I didn't want to be accused of stealing that trade secret,\" he says. \"I condemn trade secrecy, I think it's an immoral practice, but for the project to succeed, I had to work within the immoral laws that existed.\"</p> <p> Once again Stallman had set himself an almost impossible task that would require an exhaustive dedication and sacrifice - which was perhaps part of the attraction. \"I wasn't certain I could finish the job,\" he recalls, \"but it wasn't important for me to know whether I could finish the job; the point was I was going to start it.\"</p> <p> The GNU project formally began, in January 1984, when Stallman started working on a replacement for an obscure programmer's tool called Yacc. One reason he chose this was \"because there was a similar program available called Bison\" - another typical hacker pun - but it wasn't compatible with Yacc; it was missing some features.\" Stallman obtained permission from the author to make Bison compatible with Yacc, and in doing so, he put in place the first small stone of the GNU edifice.</p> <p> Having limbered up with this relatively minor task, Stallman moved on to one of the most important. One of the key elements of a Unix system is the C compiler. Programs written in C are text files whose contents are lines of instructions following the rules of the language. Before a computer can obey the instructions contained in the source code, they must be converted into binaries - the sequence of Os and 1s that the processor chip can understand.</p> <p> This is the job of the C compiler - a kind of mediator between the source code and binaries, which is therefore an indispensable tool for every C programmer. As such, it held a particular importance for Stallman in his endeavor to create a new, freely available version of Unix. A poor C compiler might seriously damage the chances of GNU's being taken seriously; equally, a great C compiler that was free would immediately make people sit up and take notice of the project.</p> <p> Once more, Stallman tried to build on an existing program to minimize the amount of work that needed doing, and something he had heard about seemed to be perfect for the job. The Amsterdam Compiler Kit was a powerful compiler that ran on Unix and could compile not just C but most of the languages then in use. It had been written by the U.S. academic Andrew Tanenbaum at the Free University of Amsterdam. Perhaps slightly misled by another name for the software - the Free University Compiler Kit - Stallman wrote to Tanenbaum to ask whether he could use it for his GNU project.</p> <p> As Stallman recalls, [Tanenbaum] said, \"The university is free; the compiler isn't. Why don't you give up that silly idea of a free system? I'd like to have some utilities to distribute with the compiler to boost sales. Contribute some utilities to me and I'll give you a share of the profits.\" What seemed eminently reasonable - generous even - to Tanenbaum, was an insult to Stallman, for whom proprietary software of the kind represented by the Amsterdam Compiler Kit was precisely what he was hoping to combat with his GNU project.</p> <p> Tanenbaum doesn't recall what he said exactly, but he explains why he was unable to give permission for the Amsterdam Compiler Kit (ACK) to be used by Stallman as part of GNU: \"I think we may have already signed a contract to sell ACK commercially via a company in the U.S. and one in Europe,\" he says. \"Our research group needed that money to support graduate students, etc., and as I recall, we were already committed when he came around.\"</p> <p> Despite these laudable aims, Stallman saw only Tanenbaum's refusal to aid him in his free software crusade. His response was identical to that he had made to Symbolics a few years earlier: He determined to write his own rival software that would match or beat the offending code.</p> <p> In September 1984, after an unsuccessful attempt to adapt yet another compiler, Stallman returned to his most successful program so far, Emacs. The code for this new Emacs, which became known as GNU Emacs, had \"nothing in common with the original Emacs, which was written in TECO,\" Stallman says. And in another symbolic act of return to his AI Lab roots, he decided to rewrite most of GNU Emacs in Lisp, that \"powerful and elegant language\" Stallman prized so highly.</p> <p> By early 1985, GNU Emacs was able to edit files, and Stallman made it available publicly. This was an important step because it represented the first time people could use and judge GNU software. Even though the free GNU operating system was almost nonexistent, people could still use Emacs: The Unix compatibility that was Stallman's constant guide meant that GNU Emacs could run on any Unix and provide him with a huge potential constituency of users.</p> <p> First, \"people started asking for and writing improvements, and the result was I kept working on Emacs a lot, much longer that I'd expected to, and it ended up much better than I'd originally planned on its being,\" recalls Stallman. This approach of releasing code and encouraging feedback and modifications from users, although not new - it had formed an implicit part of the entire Unix culture for year - became central to the rapid improvement of free software over the next fifteen years. Its adoption in an extreme form for the development of Linux was one of the key factors in its rapid growth and robustness.</p> <p> The second consequence of making Emacs available was that Stallman could sell it on tape, the standard distribution medium before floppies; this was alongside free distribution on the Internet because at that time few people had access to this fledgling medium. As well as serving users who might otherwise find it difficult to obtain copies, selling tapes bad the even more beneficial effect of giving Stallman an income. \"See,\" he says, \"I had quit my job at MIT to start the GNU project. And the reason is I wanted to make sure that MIT would not be in a position to interfere with making GNU software free in the way I wanted to do it. I didn't want to have to beg the MIT administration for permission to do this and then maybe they would insist on spoiling it in some way.\"</p> <p> To its credit, the AI Lab allowed Staliman to continue to use its computers, and to sleep in his former office at 545 Tech Square for twelve years. He was even registered to vote at that address. Stallman did retain one significant moment of those happy times: his log - in ID. To this day he signs himself \"rms,\" his original username for the ITS machine, and most of the hacker world knows him by these initials.</p> <p> Although Stallman says that he lived cheaply - I would have done so for the sake of this project, but I'd always lived cheaply,\" money was an obvious concern in those early days of GNU. \"I didn't know at the beginning whether I would have any sources of income,\" he recalls, though \"for the first year I think I was paid by LMI to update some manuals from MIT.\" In any case, \"the point is.\" he says. \"I was utterly determined to do this; nothing could have intimidated me at that point.\"</p> <p> Fortunately, selling GNU Emacs for $150 a tape - \"I just thought it would be a good price,\" he explains - soon provided him with a steady income. \"By the middle of the year, I was getting some eight to ten orders a month and that was enough for me to live on [although] I couldn't have saved any money from that alone.\"</p> <p> With GNU Emacs out of the way, and perhaps encouraged by its reception and the money he was starting to receive from it, Stallman turned his thoughts to the other projects, including that problematic C compiler. This time, he decided he would not try to adapt a pre - existing program, but would write it all himself. It proved a hugely complex project. \"It was the most challenging program I've ever written.\" he says simply. \"It's one that required me to write plans down on paper rather than just code.\"</p> <p> Stallman's general approach to coding is quite different. \"I start with a sort of vague idea in my head,\" he says, \"and I find some part of the job I can write, and then having written one part will enable me to envision neighboring parts enough that I can write them; and then I basically go through and end up having written the whole thing.\" This probably explains in part why Unix was so attractive as a model for his GNU' project: Its use of many small elements meant that Stallman could \"find some part of the job\" he could write - a utility here, a program there - and then \"basically go through and end up having written the whole thing.\"</p> <p> Stallman called his compiler GCC - for GNU C Compiler. Even more than GNU Emacs, it helped spread the word about the GNU project because GCC proved to be top - class software. \"There was a period of a few years when GCC was pretty much the best compiler available for most of the systems it supported,\" he recalls. \"But that wasn't immediate, it took a while of working on optimization before it got to be the best.\" As with Emacs, this optimization was helped enormously by the comments Stallman received from users once the program was released.</p> <p> The new GCC also boosted his income further. It \"opened up the possibilities of commissions a lot more. People were more interested in commissioning changes in GCC, and in commissioning classes about GCC, than they were doing similar things for Emacs.\" Stallman says. \"I was very glad to have that source of income, especially when the Free Software Foundation was formed. I think it was October 1985; it took over from me the business of selling Emacs tapes, so I didn't have that income any more.\"</p> <p> The Free Software Foundation (FSF) represented an important step forward for GNU. \"When I started it out, it didn't have the money to hire anyone. Then it had money to hire one person, and it hired one person,\" he explains. \"The point is just that that enabled us to do more work at the same time because there were lots and lots of programs that were missing.\" Gradually, more of these programs were written, either by Stallman himself or by the growing band of FSF staff and volunteers. \"In the earliest years [there were just] two or three people [helping],\" he remembers; \"by the later 80s, I'd expect there were somewhere between thirty and fifty people.\"</p> <p> Two of the other big projects were to create a shell program and a C library. A shell provides the basic interface to the operating system: \"If you want to be able to type any commands, you need a shell,\" say's Stallman. GNU's program is called Bash, which is short for Bourne Again Shell, a play on the Unix shell called the Bourne shell.</p> <p> The C library is a chunk of auxiliary code that other programs can call. By separating out an entire set of commonly used functions in this way, user programs can be much smaller. Creating a C library for GNU was therefore a key prerequisite before the GNU operating system could run such user programs and do something useful.</p> <p> Both the C library and Bash were finished around 1990, along with many other elements of the Unix operating system. Still missing, though, in many ways the single most important program of all: the kernel. As its name suggests, the kernel sits at the very heart of the operating system. It acts as housekeeper (handling tasks such as the screen and keyboard) and judge (ensuring that all the competing calls for attention from user programs are handled correctly). Although many other programs are indispensable for a fully functional operating system - for example a C library and a shell - it is the kernel that defines its essence.</p> <p> That Stallman had left the kernel until last might seem strange given its central nature. In part it was because he had been distracted by his feud with Tanenbaum and his vow that a C compiler would be one of the first programs that he wrote for his GNU system. In addition, it made sense to develop all the programming tools first so that they could then be used in the creation of the kernel.</p> <p> There was another reason, however. \"I was trying to bypass the hardest part of the job.\" Stallman says. Debugging kernels is difficult because the standard programming tools depend on a functioning kernel. To get round this, Stallman had been on the lookout once more for suitable software that could be adapted - and he had something particular in mind: \"I was looking for a microkernel\" he says.</p> <p> A microkernel is a kernel that takes the idea of a small, central adjudicating piece of software to its logical conclusion; it makes all the other housekeeping tasks normally found in a kernel into programs that are controlled just like end-user applications such as word processing and spreadsheets. The pros and cons of this approach with respect to the classic all-in-one kernel - known as a monolithic kernel - form the subject of what hackers call a \"religious war\" between their respective adherents that rages to this day.</p> <p> Stallman was interested in microkernels not for reasons of doctrine but because, he says, \"that way we could avoid the job of debugging the part of the software that runs on the bare machine\" - the underlying hardware. As usual, he was sensibly trying to save time and effort by taking existing code that had tackled one of the harder parts and building on it. He also thought the design provided some \"nice features.\"</p> <p> Stallman was lucky - or so he thought at the time. \"Eventually we found a microkernel that at least was supposedly already developed and working,\" he says, \"and we just had to write the user programs [that] do the jobs . . . normally done by parts of the kernel\" to create that missing heart of the GNU operating system, which was dubbed the GNU Hurd.</p> <p> Unfortunately, the microkernel he found \"wasn't already working totally reliably,\" as he had believed. Moreover, eliminating all the errors from this code proved much more difficult than expected. \"It turns out that the debugging environment we had was hard.\" he explains. \"In effect, the problem with this was it was a research project, and in general my policy was to avoid research projects [and] use tried-and-true designs, because a research project is risky. You may try out an idea and find that it doesn't work very well. Anyway, we tried out this design, and found out that it was hard to get it finished.\"</p> <p> In fact, \"in retrospect, it seems that developing a monolithic kernel would have been maybe faster and easier and might have been the right thing to do\" - the first working version of the Hurd wasn't released until 1996. But Stallman is philosophical about the matter: \"You see,\" he says, \"any individual software project is just a piece of the GNU project; the GNU project isn't fundamentally about developing this piece of software or that piece of software. GNU, like any operating system, is a collection of many programs. We wrote some, and we obtained some from elsewhere; in the end, we achieved the overall goal of a complete free system.\"</p> <p> As Stallman began writing the components of his GNU operating system and released them to the public, one of his primary concerns was to ensure that the programs he and his fellow coders were creating would remain free and open as they were passed on from user to user; simply putting them in the public domain would not achieve this because someone could easily come along and sell the GNU programs as proprietary products. Stallman needed to do something new and radical, namely, to draw up a software license that did not restrict the user's rights, as most did, but that protected them.</p> <p> He did this first with the GNU Emacs General Public License, in 1985. \"I worked with a lawyer to draw it up,\" he says; he had to make sure that the freedoms he was trying to perpetuate were watertight legally. Under this new \"copyleft\" - as opposed to copyright - users could copy the program, modify it, and sell the original or the modified versions. They could not modify the rights granted by the copyleft to any user, however; for example, software based on the program they sold had also to be freely available. Similarly, modifications they made to a copylefted program had to be copylefted - and so freely available. Furthermore, if software released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) were combined with proprietary (nonfree) code, the resultant combination had to be released under the GPL. In other words, the GNU GPL \"converted\" software it was used with to its own license, an extraordinarily clever approach to propagating freedom.</p> <p> This first GNU Emacs General Public License (GPL) was followed later by a GCC GPL and a similar license for several other GNU programs. But Stallman realized that this piecemeal approach was not only inelegant (a cardinal sin among hackers) but also inconvenient because it blocked certain uses. For example. \"you couldn't take code from one [program released under a GPL license] and put it in another.\" Stallman explains, \"so I decided that we had better have a single license that could be used for all of them.\" This was the GNU General Public License - what Stallman calls \"the subroutinised license\" because \"you could drop it verbatim into any program and it would apply,\" just as programming subroutines can be dropped into other code to save time - and boost their elegance.</p> <p> Stallman's intent in crafting the GNU GPL was to protect the newly forged liberties that his GNU software embodied. But the GNU GPL had another consequence that would prove key to the success of later free software projects such as Linux.</p> <p> The freedom to modify a GNU GPL program means that the source code for copylefted software must be available: If the binaries only - the sequence of 0s and 1s - are supplied, modifying the program is impractical and therefore breaches the license. Part of the GNU GPL's effect is therefore to ensure that the source is always available for a program; this is vital if others are to adapt and - especially - improve the program. More - over, the GNU GPL also ensures that such improvements must be freely available, along with their source code, to enable the community as a whole to benefit from the collective advances of all users.</p> <p> It also minimizes duplication of effort. Once a program carrying out a function is released under copyleft, others can then take this work for granted when they write similar software. There is no need to reinvent the wheel every time a particular type of program is written as is the case with commercial software.</p> <p> Stallman created in the GNU GPL a kind of written constitution for the hacker world that enshrined basic assumptions about how their community should function. In doing so, he enabled that world to progress far more efficiently than it had in the past when all these \"laws\" were unwritten. As the use of the GNU GPL became more common, so its power grew, because the more copylefted programs there are the greater the pool for future such programs to draw on; this eases their creation and the pool of GPL'd software grows yet further.</p> <p> This enormous efficiency acted as one of the main engines in driving the free software projects on to their extraordinary successes during the 1990s. For this alone, and for his work in putting together the GNU system, the computer community's debt to Stallman is immense.</p> <p> Yet for Stallman this emphasis on inherent efficiency misses the point about the GNU project and about the GNU GPL. His essential concern is freedom, and the GNU project a means to an end rather than an end in itself.</p> <p> \"The overall purpose.\" Stallman explains, \"is to give the users freedom by giving them free software they can use and to extend the boundaries of what you can do with entirely free software as far as possible. Because the idea of GNU is to make it possible for people to do things with their computers without accepting [the] domination of somebody else. Without letting some owner of software say, 'I won't let you understand how this works; I'm going to keep you helplessly dependent on me and if you share with your friends. I'll call you a pirate and put you in jail)'.\"</p> <p> \"I consider that immoral.\" Stallman continues, \"and I'm working to put an end to that way of life, because it's a way of life nobody should have to be part of, and the only way you can do that is by writing a lot of software and saying to people, 'Come, use it, share it with your friends, change it to do whatever you want it do.

      "bodyText": "Once Stallman had decided on this new course of action - creating a free operating system - he soon made \"the major design decision - that we would follow Unix,\" he says. In retrospect, it might have seemed the obvious choice, but at the time this was by' no means the case because Stallman knew little about the system. \"I'd never used it,\" he says. \"I'd only read a little about it, but it seemed like it was a good, clean design [that had some] nice clean and powerful ideas.\" But the main impetus for his choice grew once again out of his experiences during the diaspora of the hacker community at the AI Lab. \"Digital had discontinued the PDP - 1O\" - the last machine on which ITS had run - \"which meant that ITS was now completely unusable on any modern computer,\" Stallman says. \"And I didn't want that kind of thing to happen again. The only way to prevent it from happening again was to write a portable system.\" Stallman wanted an operating system that could be easily transferred from one type of hardware to another. Because most operating systems had been conceived as the housekeeping software for one type of computer, portability was the exception rather than the rule. \"Unix was, at least as far as I knew, the only portable system that really had users on different kinds of computers. So it was portable not just in theory but in actual practice,\" Stallman says. Another important reason why Stallman chose Unix as his model, he explains, was that he \"decided to make the system compatible with Unix so people who had already written programs for Unix would be able to run them on this system. People who knew how to use Unix would know how to use this system without being required to learn something new.\" Once again, as he had with Emacs, he was building on something that already existed, but making it better - in this case, by creating a Unix - like system that could be shared freely Although the project was born at this most unhappy time for Stallman, the name he chose for his new project showed a typical hacker humor. His Unix work-alike would be called GNU, an acronym that stood for \"GNU'S Not Unix,\" and which thus explained itself self referentially. This kind of recursion is often used as a programming technique, and applying it to words is highly popular amongst hackers. The name GNU also proved a fruitful source of inspiration for similarly self-referential names for many of the programs that went to make up the overall GNU project. Another important virtue of Unix was that its design \"consists of a lot of small pieces, often fairly small pieces,\" Stallman explains; to create a Unix-like system, \"what you do is you just have to write each piece. So I sat down and started writing small pieces.\" Although this makes the entire process sound disarmingly simple, writing these \"small pieces\" involved reproducing work that had taken hundreds of people fifteen years - an even harder task than when Stallman matched the team of programmers at Symbolics. In his fight against that company, he was able to look at the source code - the underlying lines of programming - to help him write his own versions: hut with Unix this was not an option. \"I certainly never looked at the source code of Unix,\" Stallman says. \"Never. I once accidentally saw a file, and when I realized it was part of Unix source code, I stopped looking at it.\" The reason was simple: The source code \"was a trade secret, and I didn't want to be accused of stealing that trade secret,\" he says. \"I condemn trade secrecy, I think it's an immoral practice, but for the project to succeed, I had to work within the immoral laws that existed.\" Once again Stallman had set himself an almost impossible task that would require an exhaustive dedication and sacrifice - which was perhaps part of the attraction. \"I wasn't certain I could finish the job,\" he recalls, \"but it wasn't important for me to know whether I could finish the job; the point was I was going to start it.\" The GNU project formally began, in January 1984, when Stallman started working on a replacement for an obscure programmer's tool called Yacc. One reason he chose this was \"because there was a similar program available called Bison\" - another typical hacker pun - but it wasn't compatible with Yacc; it was missing some features.\" Stallman obtained permission from the author to make Bison compatible with Yacc, and in doing so, he put in place the first small stone of the GNU edifice. Having limbered up with this relatively minor task, Stallman moved on to one of the most important. One of the key elements of a Unix system is the C compiler. Programs written in C are text files whose contents are lines of instructions following the rules of the language. Before a computer can obey the instructions contained in the source code, they must be converted into binaries - the sequence of Os and 1s that the processor chip can understand. This is the job of the C compiler - a kind of mediator between the source code and binaries, which is therefore an indispensable tool for every C programmer. As such, it held a particular importance for Stallman in his endeavor to create a new, freely available version of Unix. A poor C compiler might seriously damage the chances of GNU's being taken seriously; equally, a great C compiler that was free would immediately make people sit up and take notice of the project. Once more, Stallman tried to build on an existing program to minimize the amount of work that needed doing, and something he had heard about seemed to be perfect for the job. The Amsterdam Compiler Kit was a powerful compiler that ran on Unix and could compile not just C but most of the languages then in use. It had been written by the U.S. academic Andrew Tanenbaum at the Free University of Amsterdam. Perhaps slightly misled by another name for the software - the Free University Compiler Kit - Stallman wrote to Tanenbaum to ask whether he could use it for his GNU project. As Stallman recalls, [Tanenbaum] said, \"The university is free; the compiler isn't. Why don't you give up that silly idea of a free system? I'd like to have some utilities to distribute with the compiler to boost sales. Contribute some utilities to me and I'll give you a share of the profits.\" What seemed eminently reasonable - generous even - to Tanenbaum, was an insult to Stallman, for whom proprietary software of the kind represented by the Amsterdam Compiler Kit was precisely what he was hoping to combat with his GNU project. Tanenbaum doesn't recall what he said exactly, but he explains why he was unable to give permission for the Amsterdam Compiler Kit (ACK) to be used by Stallman as part of GNU: \"I think we may have already signed a contract to sell ACK commercially via a company in the U.S. and one in Europe,\" he says. \"Our research group needed that money to support graduate students, etc., and as I recall, we were already committed when he came around.\" Despite these laudable aims, Stallman saw only Tanenbaum's refusal to aid him in his free software crusade. His response was identical to that he had made to Symbolics a few years earlier: He determined to write his own rival software that would match or beat the offending code. In September 1984, after an unsuccessful attempt to adapt yet another compiler, Stallman returned to his most successful program so far, Emacs. The code for this new Emacs, which became known as GNU Emacs, had \"nothing in common with the original Emacs, which was written in TECO,\" Stallman says. And in another symbolic act of return to his AI Lab roots, he decided to rewrite most of GNU Emacs in Lisp, that \"powerful and elegant language\" Stallman prized so highly. By early 1985, GNU Emacs was able to edit files, and Stallman made it available publicly. This was an important step because it represented the first time people could use and judge GNU software. Even though the free GNU operating system was almost nonexistent, people could still use Emacs: The Unix compatibility that was Stallman's constant guide meant that GNU Emacs could run on any Unix and provide him with a huge potential constituency of users. First, \"people started asking for and writing improvements, and the result was I kept working on Emacs a lot, much longer that I'd expected to, and it ended up much better than I'd originally planned on its being,\" recalls Stallman. This approach of releasing code and encouraging feedback and modifications from users, although not new - it had formed an implicit part of the entire Unix culture for year - became central to the rapid improvement of free software over the next fifteen years. Its adoption in an extreme form for the development of Linux was one of the key factors in its rapid growth and robustness. The second consequence of making Emacs available was that Stallman could sell it on tape, the standard distribution medium before floppies; this was alongside free distribution on the Internet because at that time few people had access to this fledgling medium. As well as serving users who might otherwise find it difficult to obtain copies, selling tapes bad the even more beneficial effect of giving Stallman an income. \"See,\" he says, \"I had quit my job at MIT to start the GNU project. And the reason is I wanted to make sure that MIT would not be in a position to interfere with making GNU software free in the way I wanted to do it. I didn't want to have to beg the MIT administration for permission to do this and then maybe they would insist on spoiling it in some way.\" To its credit, the AI Lab allowed Staliman to continue to use its computers, and to sleep in his former office at 545 Tech Square for twelve years. He was even registered to vote at that address. Stallman did retain one significant moment of those happy times: his log - in ID. To this day he signs himself \"rms,\" his original username for the ITS machine, and most of the hacker world knows him by these initials. Although Stallman says that he lived cheaply - I would have done so for the sake of this project, but I'd always lived cheaply,\" money was an obvious concern in those early days of GNU. \"I didn't know at the beginning whether I would have any sources of income,\" he recalls, though \"for the first year I think I was paid by LMI to update some manuals from MIT.\" In any case, \"the point is.\" he says. \"I was utterly determined to do this; nothing could have intimidated me at that point.\" Fortunately, selling GNU Emacs for $150 a tape - \"I just thought it would be a good price,\" he explains - soon provided him with a steady income. \"By the middle of the year, I was getting some eight to ten orders a month and that was enough for me to live on [although] I couldn't have saved any money from that alone.\" With GNU Emacs out of the way, and perhaps encouraged by its reception and the money he was starting to receive from it, Stallman turned his thoughts to the other projects, including that problematic C compiler. This time, he decided he would not try to adapt a pre - existing program, but would write it all himself. It proved a hugely complex project. \"It was the most challenging program I've ever written.\" he says simply. \"It's one that required me to write plans down on paper rather than just code.\" Stallman's general approach to coding is quite different. \"I start with a sort of vague idea in my head,\" he says, \"and I find some part of the job I can write, and then having written one part will enable me to envision neighboring parts enough that I can write them; and then I basically go through and end up having written the whole thing.\" This probably explains in part why Unix was so attractive as a model for his GNU' project: Its use of many small elements meant that Stallman could \"find some part of the job\" he could write - a utility here, a program there - and then \"basically go through and end up having written the whole thing.\" Stallman called his compiler GCC - for GNU C Compiler. Even more than GNU Emacs, it helped spread the word about the GNU project because GCC proved to be top - class software. \"There was a period of a few years when GCC was pretty much the best compiler available for most of the systems it supported,\" he recalls. \"But that wasn't immediate, it took a while of working on optimization before it got to be the best.\" As with Emacs, this optimization was helped enormously by the comments Stallman received from users once the program was released. The new GCC also boosted his income further. It \"opened up the possibilities of commissions a lot more. People were more interested in commissioning changes in GCC, and in commissioning classes about GCC, than they were doing similar things for Emacs.\" Stallman says. \"I was very glad to have that source of income, especially when the Free Software Foundation was formed. I think it was October 1985; it took over from me the business of selling Emacs tapes, so I didn't have that income any more.\" The Free Software Foundation (FSF) represented an important step forward for GNU. \"When I started it out, it didn't have the money to hire anyone. Then it had money to hire one person, and it hired one person,\" he explains. \"The point is just that that enabled us to do more work at the same time because there were lots and lots of programs that were missing.\" Gradually, more of these programs were written, either by Stallman himself or by the growing band of FSF staff and volunteers. \"In the earliest years [there were just] two or three people [helping],\" he remembers; \"by the later 80s, I'd expect there were somewhere between thirty and fifty people.\" Two of the other big projects were to create a shell program and a C library. A shell provides the basic interface to the operating system: \"If you want to be able to type any commands, you need a shell,\" say's Stallman. GNU's program is called Bash, which is short for Bourne Again Shell, a play on the Unix shell called the Bourne shell. The C library is a chunk of auxiliary code that other programs can call. By separating out an entire set of commonly used functions in this way, user programs can be much smaller. Creating a C library for GNU was therefore a key prerequisite before the GNU operating system could run such user programs and do something useful. Both the C library and Bash were finished around 1990, along with many other elements of the Unix operating system. Still missing, though, in many ways the single most important program of all: the kernel. As its name suggests, the kernel sits at the very heart of the operating system. It acts as housekeeper (handling tasks such as the screen and keyboard) and judge (ensuring that all the competing calls for attention from user programs are handled correctly). Although many other programs are indispensable for a fully functional operating system - for example a C library and a shell - it is the kernel that defines its essence. That Stallman had left the kernel until last might seem strange given its central nature. In part it was because he had been distracted by his feud with Tanenbaum and his vow that a C compiler would be one of the first programs that he wrote for his GNU system. In addition, it made sense to develop all the programming tools first so that they could then be used in the creation of the kernel. There was another reason, however. \"I was trying to bypass the hardest part of the job.\" Stallman says. Debugging kernels is difficult because the standard programming tools depend on a functioning kernel. To get round this, Stallman had been on the lookout once more for suitable software that could be adapted - and he had something particular in mind: \"I was looking for a microkernel\" he says. A microkernel is a kernel that takes the idea of a small, central adjudicating piece of software to its logical conclusion; it makes all the other housekeeping tasks normally found in a kernel into programs that are controlled just like end-user applications such as word processing and spreadsheets. The pros and cons of this approach with respect to the classic all-in-one kernel - known as a monolithic kernel - form the subject of what hackers call a \"religious war\" between their respective adherents that rages to this day. Stallman was interested in microkernels not for reasons of doctrine but because, he says, \"that way we could avoid the job of debugging the part of the software that runs on the bare machine\" - the underlying hardware. As usual, he was sensibly trying to save time and effort by taking existing code that had tackled one of the harder parts and building on it. He also thought the design provided some \"nice features.\" Stallman was lucky - or so he thought at the time. \"Eventually we found a microkernel that at least was supposedly already developed and working,\" he says, \"and we just had to write the user programs [that] do the jobs . . . normally done by parts of the kernel\" to create that missing heart of the GNU operating system, which was dubbed the GNU Hurd. Unfortunately, the microkernel he found \"wasn't already working totally reliably,\" as he had believed. Moreover, eliminating all the errors from this code proved much more difficult than expected. \"It turns out that the debugging environment we had was hard.\" he explains. \"In effect, the problem with this was it was a research project, and in general my policy was to avoid research projects [and] use tried-and-true designs, because a research project is risky. You may try out an idea and find that it doesn't work very well. Anyway, we tried out this design, and found out that it was hard to get it finished.\" In fact, \"in retrospect, it seems that developing a monolithic kernel would have been maybe faster and easier and might have been the right thing to do\" - the first working version of the Hurd wasn't released until 1996. But Stallman is philosophical about the matter: \"You see,\" he says, \"any individual software project is just a piece of the GNU project; the GNU project isn't fundamentally about developing this piece of software or that piece of software. GNU, like any operating system, is a collection of many programs. We wrote some, and we obtained some from elsewhere; in the end, we achieved the overall goal of a complete free system.\" As Stallman began writing the components of his GNU operating system and released them to the public, one of his primary concerns was to ensure that the programs he and his fellow coders were creating would remain free and open as they were passed on from user to user; simply putting them in the public domain would not achieve this because someone could easily come along and sell the GNU programs as proprietary products. Stallman needed to do something new and radical, namely, to draw up a software license that did not restrict the user's rights, as most did, but that protected them. He did this first with the GNU Emacs General Public License, in 1985. \"I worked with a lawyer to draw it up,\" he says; he had to make sure that the freedoms he was trying to perpetuate were watertight legally. Under this new \"copyleft\" - as opposed to copyright - users could copy the program, modify it, and sell the original or the modified versions. They could not modify the rights granted by the copyleft to any user, however; for example, software based on the program they sold had also to be freely available. Similarly, modifications they made to a copylefted program had to be copylefted - and so freely available. Furthermore, if software released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) were combined with proprietary (nonfree) code, the resultant combination had to be released under the GPL. In other words, the GNU GPL \"converted\" software it was used with to its own license, an extraordinarily clever approach to propagating freedom. This first GNU Emacs General Public License (GPL) was followed later by a GCC GPL and a similar license for several other GNU programs. But Stallman realized that this piecemeal approach was not only inelegant (a cardinal sin among hackers) but also inconvenient because it blocked certain uses. For example. \"you couldn't take code from one [program released under a GPL license] and put it in another.\" Stallman explains, \"so I decided that we had better have a single license that could be used for all of them.\" This was the GNU General Public License - what Stallman calls \"the subroutinised license\" because \"you could drop it verbatim into any program and it would apply,\" just as programming subroutines can be dropped into other code to save time - and boost their elegance. Stallman's intent in crafting the GNU GPL was to protect the newly forged liberties that his GNU software embodied. But the GNU GPL had another consequence that would prove key to the success of later free software projects such as Linux. The freedom to modify a GNU GPL program means that the source code for copylefted software must be available: If the binaries only - the sequence of 0s and 1s - are supplied, modifying the program is impractical and therefore breaches the license. Part of the GNU GPL's effect is therefore to ensure that the source is always available for a program; this is vital if others are to adapt and - especially - improve the program. More - over, the GNU GPL also ensures that such improvements must be freely available, along with their source code, to enable the community as a whole to benefit from the collective advances of all users. It also minimizes duplication of effort. Once a program carrying out a function is released under copyleft, others can then take this work for granted when they write similar software. There is no need to reinvent the wheel every time a particular type of program is written as is the case with commercial software. Stallman created in the GNU GPL a kind of written constitution for the hacker world that enshrined basic assumptions about how their community should function. In doing so, he enabled that world to progress far more efficiently than it had in the past when all these \"laws\" were unwritten. As the use of the GNU GPL became more common, so its power grew, because the more copylefted programs there are the greater the pool for future such programs to draw on; this eases their creation and the pool of GPL'd software grows yet further. This enormous efficiency acted as one of the main engines in driving the free software projects on to their extraordinary successes during the 1990s. For this alone, and for his work in putting together the GNU system, the computer community's debt to Stallman is immense. Yet for Stallman this emphasis on inherent efficiency misses the point about the GNU project and about the GNU GPL. His essential concern is freedom, and the GNU project a means to an end rather than an end in itself. \"The overall purpose.\" Stallman explains, \"is to give the users freedom by giving them free software they can use and to extend the boundaries of what you can do with entirely free software as far as possible. Because the idea of GNU is to make it possible for people to do things with their computers without accepting [the] domination of somebody else. Without letting some owner of software say, 'I won't let you understand how this works; I'm going to keep you helplessly dependent on me and if you share with your friends. I'll call you a pirate and put you in jail)'.\" \"I consider that immoral.\" Stallman continues, \"and I'm working to put an end to that way of life, because it's a way of life nobody should have to be part of, and the only way you can do that is by writing a lot of software and saying to people, 'Come, use it, share it with your friends, change it to do whatever you want it do. Join us, have fun.' And that's what GNU is for, it's to give people the alternative of living in freedom, and the individual software packages like GNU Emacs and GCC or the GNU Hurd, they're important because they're parts of getting that larger job done.\" Stallman has not only devoted much of his time and energy to this cause, he has given his money, too. In 1990, he won a McArthur Foundation fellowship, worth somewhere in the neighborhood of $230,000, divided into quarterly installments over five years. \"That was a lot more money than I need to live on, and more income than I had ever had before. Rather than spending it, I decided to invest most of it in mutual funds so that I can live on it for the rest of my life while working on free software or another worthy cause.\" He has no car: \"I live in a city where you don't need to have a car.\" He rents a room: \"I don't want to own a house, I don't want to spend a lot of money. If you spend a lot of money then you're the slave of having to make money. The money then jerks you around, controls your life.\" Stallman has never married or had children. \"That takes a lot of money. There's only one way I could have made that money, and that is by doing what I'd be ashamed of - writing nonfree software. \"If I had been developing proprietary software, I would have been spending my life building walls to imprison people.\" he believes. Deadly serious intensity aside, Stallman also has a lively sense of humor that manifests itself in a constant stream of ideas, puns, and hacker-type plays on words that courses through his conversations. His personal Web site carries a picture of him dressed as the outrageous be-toga'd Saint lGNUcius - a character he is happy to re-create in his travels around the world with his music CDs and a battered Toshiba portable as he gives talks whenever and wherever he can to spread his message. And yet many have a different image of Stallman: It is not so much playful mock saint as implacable Old Testament prophet - a kind of geek Moses bearing the GNU GPL commandments and trying to drag his hacker tribe to the promised land of freedom whether they want to go or not. His long hair, which falls thickly to his shoulders, full beard, and intense gaze doubtless contribute to the effect. This impression arises largely from Stallman's ability to offend even supporters through his constant refusal to compromise. \"The only reason we have a wholly free operating system is because of the movement at said we want an operating system that's wholly free, not 90 percent free,\" he says. \"If you don't have freedom as a principle, you can never see a reason not to make an exception. There are constantly going to be times when for one reason or another there's some practical convenience in making an exception.\" He admits that sometimes he gets tired of hammering home this message over and over again, but believes he must keep on doing it, even beyond the tolerance of most of his audiences if need be. \"I'm never sanguine. I've achieved a lot, but it's not whole job. The job is not finished.\" When will it be finished? \"Well, maybe never,\" he acknowledges. \"In what sense is freedom ever assured for the future? People are always going to have to work to keep a free society.\" This is the real point of the self-referential GNU's Not Unix, and of ideas like \"copyleft.\" For Stallman, free software matters not because software is special and deserves a special freedom; indeed, he acknowledges that \"there are more important issues of freedom - the issues of freedom that everybody's heard of are much more important than this: freedom of speech, freedom of the press, free assembly.\" Free software matters because all freedoms matter, and software happens to be the domain in which Stallman can contribute most. \"I don't see how I could do something more important in some other area,\" he says. Stallman's work is significant not only because it engendered many of the key elements and pioneered many of the processes that made the success of what came to be the combined GNU/Linux operating system possible but because it provides an ethical backdrop against which the entire free software and open source storey is unfolding. Stallman, too, should be seen as more than just the greatest hacker who has ever lived - which he almost certainly is. His example of unswerving dedication to lofty ideals may be too idealistic and daunting for most to follow, but it provides a yardstick of integrity against which the actions of his fellow coders, both great and not-so-great, may be judged.",

The first series of Clocking Off went out early last year on Sunday night and averaged 8.2m over six weeks. BBC1 controller Lorraine Heggessey shifted the second run to between 9pm and 10pm on Monday after a run of poor-performing Sunday evening dramas prompted a rethink. But so far the gamble has not paid off. Last night Clocking Off managed just 5.9m and a 23% share, according to unofficial overnights. Millionaire on ITV had a hefty 10.2m viewers and 41% audience share. Elsewhere last night BBC2's rejigged Monday line-up of comedy and Jamie Oliver continued to lord it over Channel 4. The Naked Chef repeat at 8.30pm and Paul Merton's encounter with Terry Venables in Room 101 from 10pm brought BBC2 its best post-7pm audience shares. Both had 13% of the available audience at the time, with Naked Chef pulling in 3.2m viewers and Room 101 managing 2.7m. The pukka young chef was up against repeated Channel 4 Equinox documentary the Box, which looked at airplane black box recorders between 8pm and 9pm. But the Box brought in only 1m viewers and a 4% audience share. Room 101 was against repeated Julia Roberts movie Steel Magnolias on Channel 4, which began at 10pm and ran until 12.10am, pulling in 2.1m and a 16% share. Between 9pm and 10pm, BBC2's comedy duo of Never Mind the Buzzcocks and Harry Enfield's Television Programme repeat beat Channel 4's to the Ends of the Earth documentary on surfing. Buzzcocks had 2.5m and Harry Enfield pulled in 2.1m; while Channel 4's Ride the Wild Surf had just 1.6m.",

      "body": "<p>Tony Blair should attack the refusal of Whitehall to embrace fundamental reforms by establishing a royal commission on the future of the civil service, a Labour controlled select committee of MPs recommends today. </p> <p>The proposal has support in parts of Downing Street where there is growing frustration at the slowness of change in Whitehall and civil servants disinterest in the outcome of Labour's many policy initiatives. Mr Blair and his senior advisers want civil servants to focus much more on results and spend less time fighting departmental turf wars. </p> <p>The proposal for a royal commission comes from the Commons public administration committee which says there is a feeling \"in some quarters that the civil service has once again absorbed attempts at reform. A possible conclusion may be that the service is incapable of effectively changing itself and that reform must be imposed from the outside\". </p> <p>The MPs also point out that the head of the civil service, Sir Richard Wilson, has admitted he will not meet his target of 35% women in the senior civil service by 2005. \"If this one target cannot be met for reasons which could have been foreseen ... it raises questions about the basis for such target setting,\" the report says. </p> <p>The MPs also call for the posts of permanent secretaries - the most senior departmental post - to be opened up to external open competition. In recent months, both the Home Office and the Education Department have filled such vacancies from within Whitehall. </p> <p>The report says local councils and agencies have complained of the \"constant need to bid and rebid for central funds and the requirement to comply with a plethora of inspection regimes and externally imposed targets\". </p> <p>The MPs say these targets imply a lack of trust and stem from an excessive centralism. </p> <p>They suggest \"the twin imperatives of performance and accountability seem to us point inexorably towards a system of elected regional government combined with unitary local authorities\". </p> <p>The report also calls for the government's much criticised annual report to be changed so that claims about the government's record are subject to independent verification and endorsement.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair should attack the refusal of Whitehall to embrace fundamental reforms by establishing a royal commission on the future of the civil service, a Labour controlled select committee of MPs recommends today. The proposal has support in parts of Downing Street where there is growing frustration at the slowness of change in Whitehall and civil servants disinterest in the outcome of Labour's many policy initiatives. Mr Blair and his senior advisers want civil servants to focus much more on results and spend less time fighting departmental turf wars. The proposal for a royal commission comes from the Commons public administration committee which says there is a feeling \"in some quarters that the civil service has once again absorbed attempts at reform. A possible conclusion may be that the service is incapable of effectively changing itself and that reform must be imposed from the outside\". The MPs also point out that the head of the civil service, Sir Richard Wilson, has admitted he will not meet his target of 35% women in the senior civil service by 2005. \"If this one target cannot be met for reasons which could have been foreseen ... it raises questions about the basis for such target setting,\" the report says. The MPs also call for the posts of permanent secretaries - the most senior departmental post - to be opened up to external open competition. In recent months, both the Home Office and the Education Department have filled such vacancies from within Whitehall. The report says local councils and agencies have complained of the \"constant need to bid and rebid for central funds and the requirement to comply with a plethora of inspection regimes and externally imposed targets\". The MPs say these targets imply a lack of trust and stem from an excessive centralism. They suggest \"the twin imperatives of performance and accountability seem to us point inexorably towards a system of elected regional government combined with unitary local authorities\". The report also calls for the government's much criticised annual report to be changed so that claims about the government's record are subject to independent verification and endorsement.",

      "bodyText": "Rupert Murdoch has emerged as a surprise rival to media tycoon Ted Turner in the tussle for control of the NTV television station in Russia. The owner of News Corp has been approached to back an alternative bid for the private broadcaster, which has been taken over by the state-controlled Gazprom gas group in a boardroom coup. Mr Turner, founder of the CNN news channel and vice-president of AOL Time Warner, has joined a consortium that plans to buy most of the 47% stake in NTV owned by founder Vladimir Gusinsky. However, Mr Turner will only go ahead with the deal if he receives assurances Gazprom will maintain the editorial independence of the station, which is Russia's only independent national network. This pause has allowed commercial rivals of the cable mogul to approach Mr Murdoch, who is understood to have given the move short shrift despite his history of enmity with Mr Turner. The shrewd billionaire is unlikely to be drawn into a situation that has become a major political embarrassment for president Vladimir Putin. Mr Putin has been accused of hounding NTV for its criticism of the ongoing war in Chechnya and secretly backing the Gazprom takeover. German chancellor Gerhard Schroeder was dragged into the affair today when he was interviewed by an NTV-owned radio station during a state visit to Russia. Mr Schroeder had promised to discuss the importance of an independent media with Mr Putin but ducked the NTV issue during the phone-in.

A report drawn up last week for the prime minister, seen by BBC2's Newsnight, suggested that the scale of the illicit movements may have contributed to the spread of the disease. Meanwhile, it was revealed today that the crisis has helped high street sales grow for the second consecutive month as consumers have stocked up on meat It also emerged today that the disease is costing the beer and pubs industry \u00a338m a month, with one in 10 pubs either closing or suffering a significant dip in profits, according to industry body the Brewers and Licensed Retailers Association. The disease, which has also badly affected rural tourism, has caused the turnover in pubs to fall an average of 18%, although in some heavily-infected regions, such as Devon and Cumbria, losses are as high as 46%. There was some good news today however, as Stonehenge re-opened to visitors after being closed for more than five weeks because of the crisis. On illegal sheep movements, the agriculture minister, Nick Brown, last night acknowledged that they could have led to foot and mouth being transmitted to areas that had previously been disease-free. \"It is highly unlikely to be windborne or to do with happenstance or anything other than the movements of vehicles, people or livestock,\" he said. \"If people have done something wrong - and that means moving livestock without licences - then they should be prosecuted.\" The practice of \"bed and breakfasting\" sheep - lending them out to neighbouring farmers in order to fraudulently claim EU subsidies - is said to be widespread in some areas. However, a few desperate farmers are even suspected of deliberately infecting their flocks with foot and mouth in order to claim compensation, according to Newsnight. Graham Cull, a trading standards advisor who helped compile the report for Downing Street, said that he believed that more alleged cases of illegal movements would come to light. Officials are were still trying to establish how cases had broken out over the weekend in three previously unaffected areas - Whitby in north Yorkshire, Jedburgh in the Scottish Borders and Caerphilly in south Wales. Advice from the Ministry of Agriculture and the National Farmers' Union stresses the importance of using the most stringent disinfectant methods for individuals and vehicles entering and leaving farms. According to Maff, there were 29 new cases yesterday taking the total for the UK to 1,164. Professor Roy Anderson of Imperial College, London, who advises the government on animal health, said today: \"We are at a critical phase of this particular epidemic. \"The case numbers, which were once above 60, in the last 10 days or so have fallen below 30 and have been hovering around 20 cases a day, so there is evidence that the current policy is beginning to have an effect.\" Email update Sign up for our free daily foot and mouth round-up More on the election and foot and mouth Politics: foot and mouth What's going on?

John Dickinson said he would be adopting a \"wait and see\" attitude following the arrest of Spaniard Francisco Arce Montez in Florida last month. Montez, 50, who is wanted for questioning over the rape and murder of his daughter, was picked up by police in Miami beach on suspicion of burglary, trespass, and of lewd and lascivious behaviour in an unconnected incident.

Of course, the last vehicle to be named a C5 was Sir Clive Sinclair's battery-driven bike and one may not thank Citro\u00ebn for bringing back to mind images of almost prone motorists pottering haplessly into the middle of busy intersections with nothing more to protect them than an elongated perspex bucket. </p> <p>I never went in one of Sir Clive's C5s, but I'm prepared to stick my neck out and maintain that the Citro\u00ebn version is stronger, broader and faster. I also reckon it will sell more, but perhaps we should wait and see on that. </p> <p>The car is certainly up against it in the battle for customers. The C5's rivals in what's known as the \"upper-medium sector\" (which is to say saloons for executives, but not for chairmen) are the Ford Mondeo, the VW Passat and the Renault Laguna. These are all, with good reason, award-winning cars. It's like being pitched in with Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool, week in week out. Is the best the C5 can hope for at this level a place in the UEFA Cup? Is this the Leicester City of saloon cars? </p> <p>Citro\u00ebn are clearly thinking more big league than that and, aware perhaps that the C5 is not the most beautiful object on the road (indeed, one has seen more beautiful road signs), they are investing their hopes in the car's unique futurism. We're meant, I think, to understand that, though the Mondeo and the Laguna have the edge when it comes to style and the Passat has the edge when it comes to looking like an Audi, all of them are, by comparison with the C5, products of the dim and distant 20th century. </p> <p>Easier, perhaps, to sell a pretty car than a technological miracle, but Citro\u00ebn are giving it a shot. The C5 is, for instance, one of the first cars to highlight its internal wiring system as a buying point: the \"multiplex wiring\" (nothing to do with cinemas), which enables the headlights and windscreen wipers to come on automatically and the windows to be operated by remote control, is the third thing Citro\u00ebn mention about the car. The second thing they mention is the \"advanced Direct Injection engines\" and the first is the \"Hydractive 3 suspension\". </p> <p>Even more than it was for Brunel, suspension has always been a Citro\u00ebn fad. They are the great suspenders. You may recall the tremendous bateau-shaped Citro\u00ebns of old that would take a moment to rise up off the ground after their ignitions were switched on. </p> <p>The 21st-century version of this is the Hydractive 3 system, which automatically lowers the car's height at motorway speeds and lifts it up high when the going gets bumpy - on farm tracks, for instance, or on most A-roads as they approach London. People with more sensitive backsides than mine may differ, but I cannot confidently say that the ride was gloriously more luxurious than in a Passat, Mondeo or Laguna, which don't go up and down. </p> <p>I drove two versions of the C5 - firstly, the 2.2 HDi diesel, which comes with a new particulate filter that reduces particle emissions to a level \"so low as to be almost unmeasurable\". In addition, the engine is so frugal that a single tank of petrol could probably be made to last you a year and a half, as long as you never went above 35mph and accelerated very carefully. In as much as any four-door saloon car that does up to 126mph can be, the C5 with a 2.2 diesel engine is clearly a green choice. George Bush would hate it. </p> <p>I then drove the V6 automatic, which needs refuelling every 10 minutes or so, doesn't filter its particles nearly as conscientiously and indeed guffs out almost a third as much again in terms of carbon dioxide. That said, it has the considerable advantage over the diesel model of not being a diesel model, and therefore not sounding like one. </p> <p>I guess it will come down to the individual conscience in the end: how much can you make your fondness for the polar ice caps weigh against your desire to own a car that doesn't rattle like a lorry carrying a loose load of beer kegs? Tough call. </p> <p>The interior, though unstartling, is generously decked with comforts. You can show films on the colour satellite navigation screen, though it is, of course, not recommended that you watch them while driving. </p> <p>In a heroic resistance to trends elsewhere, there are no drinks holders, presumably because the car is French and French people are not so vulgar that they need to drink on the move.

      "bodyText": "Telecoms equipment group Marconi today announced it was axing 3,000 jobs over the next year - 1,500 of them in the UK. The redundancies form part of Marconi's plans to reorganise its business and shake up its management. The job losses represent around 6% of Marconi's total workforce of 55,000 - around 20,000 of which are employed in the UK, many at large sites in Coventry and Liverpool. Marconi has not revealed details of the locations of where the job cuts would fall, as it wanted to tell staff first. But the group did unveil some good news in addition to the job cuts, with plans to create 3,000 \"highly skilled, high technology jobs\" at sites in Nottingham, Northampton and Ansty, near Coventry. \"While today's announcement contains some regrettable news, Marconi plans to be a net creator of jobs in the UK over the next 24 months, \" John Mayo, Marconi's deputy chief executive, said. \"Reshaping and modernisation leads us to recognise that our requirement for certain jobs has reduced. However we will also be recruiting, reflecting our changing skill requirements, and investing in new systems and state-of-the-art facilities. \"Where possible, we will retrain and invest in our current workforce. Where this is not possible, we will work with our employees to help them pursue other opportunities.\" But the announcement - which had been widely anticipated - has angered unions, who are furious that the news was leaked and feared their members may be the victims of the company's tumbling share price. A spokesman for the Manufacturing Science Finance union said: \"We are shocked by the announcement and by the way it was handled. There was an appalling lack of consultation with us and our members. \"We will work to avoid compulsory redundancies. We don't see the rationale, and think these are short-term reasons to combat a drop in share price. We believe Marconi is still profitable. \"We are particularly annoyed that this is another high profile company that has ridden roughshod over its workforce by making an announcement of job losses in the press rather than with the workers. He said the union would seek a meeting with the trade and industry secretary, Stephen Byers, and press for legislation to prevent companies from repeating Marconi's action. Danny Carrigan, national officer of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union and chairman of the Marconi trade unions, said: \"We spoke to the company at length last night and the position is not as bleak as it looked this time yesterday. \" He added: \"Over the next 18 months there could be a net gain of jobs, so what we're doing is saying to Marconi that they should support us as we will not accept any redundancies. \"We believe this has more to do with appeasing the anxiety of shareholders than it is dealing with problems in the company.\" A shop stewards' meeting would take place in Birmingham tomorrow to discuss the situation and there would be further discussions with Marconi on Thursday, he added. Marconi's announcement comes amid worries about the slowdown in the US, where its share price has come under pressure. But today shares in the group surged ahead as Marconi said it expected full-year operating profits to be in line with expectations. Marconi said it expected the shake-up to cost about \u00a3400m, but as a result of the change it expects to cut costs of more than \u00a3200m by the end of the year to March 2003. Today's plans will also see a management shake up, with Mr Mayo becoming chief executive, replacing Lord Simpson who will become chairman, replacing Sir Roger Hurn who is to retire. Marconi said it was reorganising itself into three divisions: networks, enterprise and wireless.

      "body": "<b>Introduction</b> <p>Sexual intercourse began<br> In nineteen sixty-three<br> (Which was rather late for me) <br> Between the end of the Chatterley ban<br> And the Beatles' first LP.</p> <p>- Philip Larkin, 'Annus Mirabilis'</p> <p>That old rogue Larkin was out by a few years of course, but he captured perfectly <a href=\"http://pers-www.wlv.ac.uk/~fa1871/60stmln.html\" target=\"_NEW\">the mood of the early 1960s</a>. It was an era in which anything was possible and nothing was safe; a time when the established order was being challenged, subverted, and ultimately buried.</p> <p>The Chatterley ban was indeed one of the first shibboleths to evaporate. In August 1960 <a href=\"http://www.penguin.co.uk/static/packages/uk/aboutus/index.html\" target=\"_NEW\">Penguin</a> was prosecuted for publishing one of DH Lawrence's lesser works, Lady Chatterley's Lover, notable only for its use of the f-word and some sublimely silly sex scenes. The trial was farcical - at one stage the jurors were invited to consider whether they would be happy for their wives and servants to read such a book - and the outcome rarely in doubt. When Penguin was given the go ahead to publish, there was minor pandemonium: the initial print run of 200,000 copies sold out on the day of issue, November 10, at the then rather stiff price of 3s 6d (17.5p).</p> <p>Several more sensations were to unfold before - to follow Larkin's conceit - the Beatles' first LP. 1961 saw the first publication of a little magazine trying to revive an age old tradition of political and social satire. It was called <a href=\"http://www.private-eye.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">Private Eye</a>. In the same year, and the same spirit, a group of Cambridge graduates - Alan Bennett, Peter Cook, Dudley Moore and Jonathan Miller - brought their irreverent revue, Beyond the Fringe, to London's West End.</p> <p>In 1962 satire burst out on television, with the late night show That Was The Week That Was, or TW3 to its aficionados. It thrived by debunking religion, politics, royalty and sex, attracting a colossal audience of some 12m viewers - almost as many as the other TV sensation of the age, <a href=\"http://www.coronationstreet.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">Coronation Street</a> - making presenter David Frost a national celebrity, and giving the BBC governors some sleepless nights.</p> <p>The mood of iconoclasm spread even to the Palace of Westminster. In 1961 a young and ardent Labour MP, Anthony Wedgwood-Benn, was barred from the House of Commons after winning a byelection at Bristol South-east, on account of having inherited a viscountcy. Tony Benn, as we now know him, went on to campaign successfully for peers to be allowed to renounce the titles - and, in his case, to shear several syllables off their names as well.</p> <p>The mood of the day was embodied in the <a href=\"http://home.clara.net/digger/sixties/\" target=\"_NEW\">explosion of pop culture</a>. Towards the end of 1962 there was a surge of interest in a new group - they were not called bands then - from Liverpool. It wasn't so much the music at first which caught the public eye (their first single, Love Me Do, barely scraped into the Top 20), but rather their bizarrely long hair. The following year, <a href=\"http://www.angelfire.com/ma/RichellePage/beatles.html\" target=\"_NEW\">curiosity became craze</a>, and <a href=\"http://beatles.sonicnet.com\" target=\"_NEW\">the Beatles</a> were on their way to their first LP.</p> <p><b>The political context</b></p> <p>Some commentators have compared the convulsions of the early 1960s, leading up to the election of <a href=\"http://www.number-10.gov.uk/default.asp?PageID=3091\" target=\"_NEW\">Harold Wilson's</a> first Labour government in 1964, with the sweeping aside of the Thatcher-Major years and the accession of Tony Blair in 1997. The analogy is tempting: both events involved the ending of long periods of unbroken Conservative government, and the promise at least of a new era. But it is a false comparison none the less. What happened in 1997 was a change of management and style. In 1964, the upheaval was much more fundamental.</p> <p>At the start of the decade, the prime minister, <a href=\"http://www.number-10.gov.uk/default.asp?PageID=3093\" target=\"_NEW\">Harold Macmillan</a>, was still basking in the glow of his 1959 near-landslide election victory, with a Commons majority of over 100. The cartoonists called him Supermac, and political writers were addicted to the adjective \"unflappable\". Urbane, patrician and when the occasion demanded utterly ruthless, he seemed scarcely threatened by a Labour party wracked by left-right dissent.</p> <p>But Supermac was not invincible at all. There was rising discontent in the country and in the Tory party over Britain's lacklustre postwar economic performance. Japan and Germany were booming, while the UK's hidebound economy was bedevilled by inflation and dreadful labour relations. Belatedly, the government lumbered towards an application to join the European Economic Community, universally known as the Common Market, but the nation was less and less enamoured by ministers who seemed to represent a bygone age.</p> <p>Rising discontent led to a series of resounding byelection defeats for the government, most sensationally at Orpington in Kent in March 1962, when a Tory majority of nearly 15,000 was turned into a majority of 7,800 for Jeremy Lubbock of the suddenly resurgent Liberal party. Macmillan, hitherto unflappable, began to flap like a wet hen. Four months after Orpington, in one of the most ruthless political bloodlettings of modern times, he abruptly sacked and replaced seven senior ministers - one-third of the entire cabinet. It was instantly dubbed 'the night of the long knives'. Supermac became Mac the Knife.</p> <p>Conservative disarray, meanwhile, was being mirrored by Labour consolidation. For much of the 1950s, the party had been convulsed by ideological wrangling, most notably over the issue of nuclear disarmament. Hugh Gaitskell, who had taken over the leadership from the last Labour prime minister, Clement Attlee, was politically all but hamstrung by the internecine strife. But the new decade, with its intangible but unmistakable sense of change, brought a new sense of purpose - and opportunity - to the party. By the time Aneurin Bevan, the leading leftist scourge of the establishment, died in 1960, the party was reinventing itself as a movement for change.</p> <p>Harold Wilson, seen as a pragmatic leftist, first challenged Gaitskell for the leadership, unsuccessfully, in November 1960. But he and his generation of Labour leaders - George Brown, Jim Callaghan, Denis Healey - were honing a new style of politics which looked to the challenges of the future, not the ideology of the past. That their time was coming, they had no doubt. But they could not have known that their ascent to power would be hastened by a scandal more sensational than any in modern British politics.</p> <p><b>Tarts, toffs and traitors</b></p> <p>Even today, in our peculiar society, we get excited when ministers and other public figures are caught with their pants down. In 1963, the very notion was deeply, deliciously shocking.</p> <p>It was still mostly a pre-pill, pre-promiscuity age, when unmarried pregnancy was a matter of deep family shame, and backstreet abortionists thrived. The tabloid newspapers were already brash but not yet sex-crazed, and were by and large polite to politicians. But when the storm broke, it was not simply driven by sex; there was a deep, dark context of rank treachery.</p> <p>Since the early 1950s, when diplomats Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean fled to their paymasters in Moscow, the chattering classes had speculated about the existence of a \"third man\". The brave new world of the 1960s did nothing to curb the tittle-tattle; indeed, as the cold war intensified, the issue assumed ever more menacing implications.</p> <p>In 1961 George Blake, another ex-diplomat, was given a record 42-year prison sentence for spying for the Russians. Sensationally, he was said to have been brainwashed by communists while in captivity in Korea. Even more sensationally, he was to escape from jail after serving only five years.</p> <p>The cold war was at its coldest, and the Soviet Union was at the zenith of its power, launching the <a href=\"http://www.kosmonaut.se/gagarin\" target=\"_NEW\">first man into space</a>, and defying the world by supervising the construction of the <a href=\"http://userpage.chemie.fu-berlin.de/BIW/wall.html\" target=\"_NEW\">Berlin Wall</a>. America's apparent impotence, meanwhile, was underlined by the fiasco of the <a href=\"http://library.advanced.org/18355/the_bay_of_pigs_attack.html\" target=\"_NEW\">Bay of Pigs</a> invasion of Cuba.</p> <p>In 1962, the <a href=\"http://library.thinkquest.org/11046/\" target=\"_NEW\">Cuban missile crisis</a> brought the world terrifyingly close to <a href=\"http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nsa/cuba_mis_cri/cuba_mis_cri.html\" target=\"_NEW\">nuclear annihilation</a>.</p> <p>Close to the peak of the crisis, a 38-year-old Admiralty clerk and the son of a vicar, William Vassall, was jailed for 18 years for spying for the USSR. He had been recruited by the KGB in a homosexual \"honey trap\". In July 1963 the government named Kim Philby, former Foreign Office colleague of Burgess and Maclean, as the \"third man\". But even that huge revelation was subsumed in a greater sensation now gripping the nation.</p> <p>For months, rumours had circulated about the private life of <a href=\"http://www.infoplease.com/cgi-bin/id/CE042288\" target=\"_NEW\">John Dennis Profumo</a>, secretary of state for war. Educated at Harrow and Oxford, he was a quintessential high Tory who had achieved cabinet rank after serving in a number of junior posts. He was married to the film star Valerie Hobson, and moved effortlessly in the highest of society.</p> <p>In the deferential spirit of the 1950s, the rumours may have been restricted to salon gossip. Now, in the new age of iconoclasm, the whispers were amplified in the media. That Was The Week That Was scored a telling blow with a splendid parody of the old music hall number, She was Poor but she was Honest. The words of the new version went: \"See him in the House of Commons / Making laws to put the blame / While the object of his passion / Walks the streets to hide her shame.\"</p> <p>The \"object of his passion\" was a young woman whose name is now embedded in British political folklore: Christine Keeler.</p> <p>Keeler, unlike Profumo, had had an extremely undistinguished life. Born in 1942, she left home at 16 after an unhappy childhood in the Thames Valley, and gravitated to London where she found work of a sort at Murray's cabaret club. There she met and befriended another showgirl, Marilyn \"Mandy\" Rice-Davies. Soon, both young women had drifted into the racy circle around Stephen Ward, a fashionable West End osteopath and socialite.</p> <p>Keeler's relationship with Ward was both torrid and rocky. They broke up several times, but he seemed to exercise an almost centripetal force on her, and always she drifted back. Soon both young women were celebrated players, albeit with bit parts, in Ward's sexual circus.</p> <p>Not all the action was centred on Ward's Wimpole Mews flat, equipped with two-way mirrors and other aids to lubricity. Soon, Keeler and Rice-Davies were circulating in more exalted milieux, including Lord Astor's country mansion of Cliveden. It was there that John Profumo first laid eyes on her. A brief but passionate affair ensued, and tongues began to wag. </p> <p>Even then, it might have been brushed under the carpet in the time honoured English way, but Profumo made a fundamental error: he lied to the House of Commons. In March 1963 he told the chamber that there was \"no impropriety whatever\" in his relationship with Keeler. Ten weeks later he appeared before MPs again to say \"with deep remorse\" that he had misled the House, and would resign.</p> <p>What brought Profumo down even more than his deceit of the Commons, was the startling revelation that Keeler had also slept with Eugene Ivanov, the naval attache at the Soviet embassy. It was that detail which captured world attention, notably in the United States, where the FBI compiled a detailed report called <a href=\"http://foia.fbi.gov/bowtie.htm\" target=\"_NEW\"> Operation Bowtie</a>.</p> <p>In Britain, Profumo's downfall naturally caused a huge sensation, inflated by the establishment's crude and cruel attempts to find scapegoats for its own embarrassment. As usual, official wrath was turned on those least able to defend themselves. Stephen Ward was prosecuted for living on immoral earnings. On the last day of his <a href=\"http://www.guardiancentury.co.uk/1960-1969/Story/0,6051,105601,00.html\" target=\"_NEW\">trial</a>, he killed himself with an overdose of sleeping tablets.</p> <p>Keeler was also tried and imprisoned on related charges. Rice-Davies, who escaped prosecution, earned a dubious immortality when, during the Ward trial, she was told that Lord Astor disputed her version of events and replied: \"He would, wouldn't he?\"</p> <p>Less than two months after Ward's tragic and mysterious death, an official report was produced by Lord Denning, master of the rolls. It was <a href=\"http://www.the-stationery-office.co.uk/uncovered/profumo.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">a hot number</a>: hundreds queued to buy a copy when it was released at midnight. But there were few juicy bits in Denning's findings. He criticised the government for failing to deal with the affair more quickly, but concluded that national security had not been compromised. And, to the dismay of the reading public, he failed to identify the man who, naked except for a mask, had served at Ward's dinner parties. There had been rumours that the \"man in a mask\" was a cabinet minister but Denning, who interviewed him, denied it.</p> <p>There it ended, though it never really went away. The <a href=\"http://www.mckellen.com/cinema/scandal/\" target=\"_NEW\">1989 movie, Scandal</a> reignited some of the controversy, and Christine Keeler raked over the embers in <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/news/20000912/A59257-2000Sep11.html\" target=\"_NEW\"> her autobiography</a>, The Truth At Last, published early in 2001. In it, she revived some of the more startling claims made at the time - though alas she was unable to offer convincing new evidence to back them up. She claims for example, that the then MI5 chief, Sir Roger Hollis, was a Soviet spy; and that Stephen Ward ran a spy ring which included Hollis and Sir Anthony Blunt, who was surveyor of the Queen's pictures. Blunt was indeed revealed as a long-time Soviet agent in the 1980s, around the same time that Hollis, the object of numerous rumours, was officially cleared.</p> <p>Now 58, Keeler has consistently said that successive governments have hushed up the truth of the sordid, sensational Profumo affair. Her only new (and unverifiable) claim, is that the cabinet minister <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/news/0101/22/world/world14.html\" target=\"_NEW\">made her pregnant</a>.</p> <p>And Profumo himself? Remarkably, he is still with us at 86, though friends say he is very frail now. It's nearly four decades since his humiliating fall from grace; years which he has devoted largely to charity work in London's East End. He has also remained true to his tribal code of honour, having never uttered a public word on the events which shook the nation in 1963.</p> <p><b>The aftermath</b></p> <p>The Profumo affair was no passing sensation. It all but brought down the Macmillan government and it almost certainly finished Macmillan himself as prime minister. In October 1963, less than a month after publication of the Denning report, the prime minister resigned citing ill health. There were no party elections in those days, and the mantle passed to the most improbable of candidates, the 14th Earl of Home.</p> <p>The Tory mandarins - known as \"the magic circle\" - were desperate to keep out the obvious successor, <a href=\"http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/EDbutler.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">Rab Butler</a>, who was on the liberal wing of the party. They preferred the Old Etonian, cricket-loving laird, who was only too happy to oblige, quickly using the recent legislation sparked by the Anthony Wedgwood-Benn affair to renounce his ancient title and transform into being plain <a href=\"http://www.number-10.gov.uk/default.asp?PageID=3092\" target=\"_NEW\">Sir Alec Douglas-Home</a>.</p> <p>It very nearly worked. Weeks after the installation of the new prime minister, the upheaval was subsumed in the global shock of the <a href=\"http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/home.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">assassination</a> of <a href=\"http://gi.grolier.com/presidents/ea/bios/35pkenn.html\" target=\"_NEW\">John F Kennedy</a>. A year later, in October 1964, Sir Alec called a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/politics97/background/pastelec/ge64.shtml\" target=\"_NEW\">general election</a>. The polls were against him and so were the satirists, who simply could not take seriously the cadaverous-featured drawling aristocrat. But the country was not so sure: the economy was looking up, the hugely respected Hugh Gaitskell had died and been replaced by the wily Harold Wilson, and Labour had been out of office since 1951.</p> <p>In the end, that last point almost certainly swung the election. The slogan \"13 wasted years\" was drummed home again and again, and found resonance with an electorate who knew they were living in a new age; one that was no longer represented by the Tory old guard who had propelled an earl into Downing Street.</p> <p>The result was close, though. Labour won 317 seats, the Conservatives 303, and the Liberals nine. Taking the Speaker and deputies into account, Wilson had a Commons majority of just four, to support him in his promise to deliver Britain into a new age.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Introduction Sexual intercourse began In nineteen sixty-three (Which was rather late for me) Between the end of the Chatterley ban And the Beatles' first LP. - Philip Larkin, 'Annus Mirabilis' That old rogue Larkin was out by a few years of course, but he captured perfectly the mood of the early 1960s. It was an era in which anything was possible and nothing was safe; a time when the established order was being challenged, subverted, and ultimately buried. The Chatterley ban was indeed one of the first shibboleths to evaporate. In August 1960 Penguin was prosecuted for publishing one of DH Lawrence's lesser works, Lady Chatterley's Lover, notable only for its use of the f-word and some sublimely silly sex scenes. The trial was farcical - at one stage the jurors were invited to consider whether they would be happy for their wives and servants to read such a book - and the outcome rarely in doubt. When Penguin was given the go ahead to publish, there was minor pandemonium: the initial print run of 200,000 copies sold out on the day of issue, November 10, at the then rather stiff price of 3s 6d (17.5p). Several more sensations were to unfold before - to follow Larkin's conceit - the Beatles' first LP. 1961 saw the first publication of a little magazine trying to revive an age old tradition of political and social satire. It was called Private Eye. In the same year, and the same spirit, a group of Cambridge graduates - Alan Bennett, Peter Cook, Dudley Moore and Jonathan Miller - brought their irreverent revue, Beyond the Fringe, to London's West End. In 1962 satire burst out on television, with the late night show That Was The Week That Was, or TW3 to its aficionados. It thrived by debunking religion, politics, royalty and sex, attracting a colossal audience of some 12m viewers - almost as many as the other TV sensation of the age, Coronation Street - making presenter David Frost a national celebrity, and giving the BBC governors some sleepless nights. The mood of iconoclasm spread even to the Palace of Westminster. In 1961 a young and ardent Labour MP, Anthony Wedgwood-Benn, was barred from the House of Commons after winning a byelection at Bristol South-east, on account of having inherited a viscountcy. Tony Benn, as we now know him, went on to campaign successfully for peers to be allowed to renounce the titles - and, in his case, to shear several syllables off their names as well. The mood of the day was embodied in the explosion of pop culture. Towards the end of 1962 there was a surge of interest in a new group - they were not called bands then - from Liverpool. It wasn't so much the music at first which caught the public eye (their first single, Love Me Do, barely scraped into the Top 20), but rather their bizarrely long hair. The following year, curiosity became craze, and the Beatles were on their way to their first LP. The political context Some commentators have compared the convulsions of the early 1960s, leading up to the election of Harold Wilson's first Labour government in 1964, with the sweeping aside of the Thatcher-Major years and the accession of Tony Blair in 1997. The analogy is tempting: both events involved the ending of long periods of unbroken Conservative government, and the promise at least of a new era. But it is a false comparison none the less. What happened in 1997 was a change of management and style. In 1964, the upheaval was much more fundamental. At the start of the decade, the prime minister, Harold Macmillan, was still basking in the glow of his 1959 near-landslide election victory, with a Commons majority of over 100. The cartoonists called him Supermac, and political writers were addicted to the adjective \"unflappable\". Urbane, patrician and when the occasion demanded utterly ruthless, he seemed scarcely threatened by a Labour party wracked by left-right dissent. But Supermac was not invincible at all. There was rising discontent in the country and in the Tory party over Britain's lacklustre postwar economic performance. Japan and Germany were booming, while the UK's hidebound economy was bedevilled by inflation and dreadful labour relations. Belatedly, the government lumbered towards an application to join the European Economic Community, universally known as the Common Market, but the nation was less and less enamoured by ministers who seemed to represent a bygone age. Rising discontent led to a series of resounding byelection defeats for the government, most sensationally at Orpington in Kent in March 1962, when a Tory majority of nearly 15,000 was turned into a majority of 7,800 for Jeremy Lubbock of the suddenly resurgent Liberal party. Macmillan, hitherto unflappable, began to flap like a wet hen. Four months after Orpington, in one of the most ruthless political bloodlettings of modern times, he abruptly sacked and replaced seven senior ministers - one-third of the entire cabinet. It was instantly dubbed 'the night of the long knives'. Supermac became Mac the Knife. Conservative disarray, meanwhile, was being mirrored by Labour consolidation. For much of the 1950s, the party had been convulsed by ideological wrangling, most notably over the issue of nuclear disarmament. Hugh Gaitskell, who had taken over the leadership from the last Labour prime minister, Clement Attlee, was politically all but hamstrung by the internecine strife. But the new decade, with its intangible but unmistakable sense of change, brought a new sense of purpose - and opportunity - to the party. By the time Aneurin Bevan, the leading leftist scourge of the establishment, died in 1960, the party was reinventing itself as a movement for change. Harold Wilson, seen as a pragmatic leftist, first challenged Gaitskell for the leadership, unsuccessfully, in November 1960. But he and his generation of Labour leaders - George Brown, Jim Callaghan, Denis Healey - were honing a new style of politics which looked to the challenges of the future, not the ideology of the past. That their time was coming, they had no doubt. But they could not have known that their ascent to power would be hastened by a scandal more sensational than any in modern British politics. Tarts, toffs and traitors Even today, in our peculiar society, we get excited when ministers and other public figures are caught with their pants down. In 1963, the very notion was deeply, deliciously shocking. It was still mostly a pre-pill, pre-promiscuity age, when unmarried pregnancy was a matter of deep family shame, and backstreet abortionists thrived. The tabloid newspapers were already brash but not yet sex-crazed, and were by and large polite to politicians. But when the storm broke, it was not simply driven by sex; there was a deep, dark context of rank treachery. Since the early 1950s, when diplomats Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean fled to their paymasters in Moscow, the chattering classes had speculated about the existence of a \"third man\". The brave new world of the 1960s did nothing to curb the tittle-tattle; indeed, as the cold war intensified, the issue assumed ever more menacing implications. In 1961 George Blake, another ex-diplomat, was given a record 42-year prison sentence for spying for the Russians. Sensationally, he was said to have been brainwashed by communists while in captivity in Korea. Even more sensationally, he was to escape from jail after serving only five years. The cold war was at its coldest, and the Soviet Union was at the zenith of its power, launching the first man into space, and defying the world by supervising the construction of the Berlin Wall. America's apparent impotence, meanwhile, was underlined by the fiasco of the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba. In 1962, the Cuban missile crisis brought the world terrifyingly close to nuclear annihilation. Close to the peak of the crisis, a 38-year-old Admiralty clerk and the son of a vicar, William Vassall, was jailed for 18 years for spying for the USSR. He had been recruited by the KGB in a homosexual \"honey trap\". In July 1963 the government named Kim Philby, former Foreign Office colleague of Burgess and Maclean, as the \"third man\". But even that huge revelation was subsumed in a greater sensation now gripping the nation. For months, rumours had circulated about the private life of John Dennis Profumo, secretary of state for war. Educated at Harrow and Oxford, he was a quintessential high Tory who had achieved cabinet rank after serving in a number of junior posts. He was married to the film star Valerie Hobson, and moved effortlessly in the highest of society. In the deferential spirit of the 1950s, the rumours may have been restricted to salon gossip. Now, in the new age of iconoclasm, the whispers were amplified in the media. That Was The Week That Was scored a telling blow with a splendid parody of the old music hall number, She was Poor but she was Honest. The words of the new version went: \"See him in the House of Commons / Making laws to put the blame / While the object of his passion / Walks the streets to hide her shame.\" The \"object of his passion\" was a young woman whose name is now embedded in British political folklore: Christine Keeler. Keeler, unlike Profumo, had had an extremely undistinguished life. Born in 1942, she left home at 16 after an unhappy childhood in the Thames Valley, and gravitated to London where she found work of a sort at Murray's cabaret club. There she met and befriended another showgirl, Marilyn \"Mandy\" Rice-Davies. Soon, both young women had drifted into the racy circle around Stephen Ward, a fashionable West End osteopath and socialite. Keeler's relationship with Ward was both torrid and rocky. They broke up several times, but he seemed to exercise an almost centripetal force on her, and always she drifted back. Soon both young women were celebrated players, albeit with bit parts, in Ward's sexual circus. Not all the action was centred on Ward's Wimpole Mews flat, equipped with two-way mirrors and other aids to lubricity. Soon, Keeler and Rice-Davies were circulating in more exalted milieux, including Lord Astor's country mansion of Cliveden. It was there that John Profumo first laid eyes on her. A brief but passionate affair ensued, and tongues began to wag. Even then, it might have been brushed under the carpet in the time honoured English way, but Profumo made a fundamental error: he lied to the House of Commons. In March 1963 he told the chamber that there was \"no impropriety whatever\" in his relationship with Keeler. Ten weeks later he appeared before MPs again to say \"with deep remorse\" that he had misled the House, and would resign. What brought Profumo down even more than his deceit of the Commons, was the startling revelation that Keeler had also slept with Eugene Ivanov, the naval attache at the Soviet embassy. It was that detail which captured world attention, notably in the United States, where the FBI compiled a detailed report called Operation Bowtie. In Britain, Profumo's downfall naturally caused a huge sensation, inflated by the establishment's crude and cruel attempts to find scapegoats for its own embarrassment. As usual, official wrath was turned on those least able to defend themselves. Stephen Ward was prosecuted for living on immoral earnings. On the last day of his trial, he killed himself with an overdose of sleeping tablets. Keeler was also tried and imprisoned on related charges. Rice-Davies, who escaped prosecution, earned a dubious immortality when, during the Ward trial, she was told that Lord Astor disputed her version of events and replied: \"He would, wouldn't he?\" Less than two months after Ward's tragic and mysterious death, an official report was produced by Lord Denning, master of the rolls. It was a hot number: hundreds queued to buy a copy when it was released at midnight. But there were few juicy bits in Denning's findings. He criticised the government for failing to deal with the affair more quickly, but concluded that national security had not been compromised. And, to the dismay of the reading public, he failed to identify the man who, naked except for a mask, had served at Ward's dinner parties. There had been rumours that the \"man in a mask\" was a cabinet minister but Denning, who interviewed him, denied it. There it ended, though it never really went away. The 1989 movie, Scandal reignited some of the controversy, and Christine Keeler raked over the embers in her autobiography, The Truth At Last, published early in 2001. In it, she revived some of the more startling claims made at the time - though alas she was unable to offer convincing new evidence to back them up. She claims for example, that the then MI5 chief, Sir Roger Hollis, was a Soviet spy; and that Stephen Ward ran a spy ring which included Hollis and Sir Anthony Blunt, who was surveyor of the Queen's pictures. Blunt was indeed revealed as a long-time Soviet agent in the 1980s, around the same time that Hollis, the object of numerous rumours, was officially cleared. Now 58, Keeler has consistently said that successive governments have hushed up the truth of the sordid, sensational Profumo affair. Her only new (and unverifiable) claim, is that the cabinet minister made her pregnant. And Profumo himself? Remarkably, he is still with us at 86, though friends say he is very frail now. It's nearly four decades since his humiliating fall from grace; years which he has devoted largely to charity work in London's East End. He has also remained true to his tribal code of honour, having never uttered a public word on the events which shook the nation in 1963. The aftermath The Profumo affair was no passing sensation. It all but brought down the Macmillan government and it almost certainly finished Macmillan himself as prime minister. In October 1963, less than a month after publication of the Denning report, the prime minister resigned citing ill health. There were no party elections in those days, and the mantle passed to the most improbable of candidates, the 14th Earl of Home. The Tory mandarins - known as \"the magic circle\" - were desperate to keep out the obvious successor, Rab Butler, who was on the liberal wing of the party. They preferred the Old Etonian, cricket-loving laird, who was only too happy to oblige, quickly using the recent legislation sparked by the Anthony Wedgwood-Benn affair to renounce his ancient title and transform into being plain Sir Alec Douglas-Home. It very nearly worked. Weeks after the installation of the new prime minister, the upheaval was subsumed in the global shock of the assassination of John F Kennedy. A year later, in October 1964, Sir Alec called a general election. The polls were against him and so were the satirists, who simply could not take seriously the cadaverous-featured drawling aristocrat. But the country was not so sure: the economy was looking up, the hugely respected Hugh Gaitskell had died and been replaced by the wily Harold Wilson, and Labour had been out of office since 1951. In the end, that last point almost certainly swung the election. The slogan \"13 wasted years\" was drummed home again and again, and found resonance with an electorate who knew they were living in a new age; one that was no longer represented by the Tory old guard who had propelled an earl into Downing Street. The result was close, though. Labour won 317 seats, the Conservatives 303, and the Liberals nine. Taking the Speaker and deputies into account, Wilson had a Commons majority of just four, to support him in his promise to deliver Britain into a new age.",

It didn't take long for us to leave that kind of nonsense behind. Wayne, direct as ever, gets us started. </p> <p>\"Come on then, Al, what's it all about, philosophy? How would you define it?\" </p> <p>I'm tempted to ask him, \"What do you mean, definition?\" but some merciful instinct for self-preservation stops me. They don't want some clever undergraduate posturing, these guys want an answer they can get a grip on right here and now so I tell them a bit about Socratic method, the method of the idiot child. </p> <p>\"You know,\" I tell them, \"when some daft kid keeps on asking, why? why?\" Yes, they know about that. \"Well that's all that philosophy is. Philosophers just ask why.\" </p> <p>There is a certain amount of storm to weather here. </p> <p>\"Is that it then? Is that all there is to it?\" \"Well, yes,\" I say, suddenly fearful that they will walk out on me and leave me to face Gwen with the ruin that I have made of her bright idea. </p> <p>All this was months ago now and I have settled down with a regular group of 12. People come and go as sentences end and new guys are shipped in and this means that there are quite regular crises as philosophy virgins are seduced into our strange ways. Philosophy has attracted men who have long sentences to serve and they bring into class the hard-faced generosity that gets them through the years. They say things that frighten me to death. Wayne on abortion: \"If we could turn back the years, Mark, wouldn't it be better, knowing as we do now that you were going to turn out to be a murdering nut-case who's been nothing but a drain on society, wouldn't aborting you have been a good idea?\" </p> <p>Dear God, I think, head in hands, he's gone too far this time. I ought to have warned him about all the trouble that Socrates was landed in by philosophy. But these guys are neighbours on the wing. They smile at each other. Sometimes, less often now, I get a bad time for being a weakling. </p> <p>\"For God's sake Al will you use your authority and sort these bastards out.\" \"I have no authority, I repudiate it, I spit on authority.\" \"Don't start all that shit,\" Pete tells me, knowing my game. \"Right,\" says Wayne, brusquely, \"come on let's get on with this.\" \"I'll read this next bit shall I,\" says Pete. I shrug and away we go. </p> <p>Wayne is a real asset; he just keeps on asking the obvious questions that no one else will ask for fear of looking stupid. He knows nothing. Or does he? Are his questions just a bit too good naturedly naive? I promise myself to get someone to have a peek in his pad where I suspect there are walls full of philosophy books. \"Hold on,\" he says, the devious Yorkshire simpleton, \"what's metaphysics then?\" Before I can tumble into his trap, Isaac turns to him and treats us all to a lucid, delightful explanation. Isaac is the youngest by far and can get terrible stick, but I suspect that he has just done himself a power of good. \"Right, OK,\" Wayne says, nodding gently into Isaac's beaming face. </p> <p>We have been talking about aesthetics for the past month or so. This has led us into censorship and this week we have been reading JM Coetzee on Taking Offence. Coetzee suggests that taking offence is a transaction where the powerful and the powerless exchange roles and potencies. Far too late it dawns on me that making this explicit could get one or two of the more idealistic guys into trouble back on the wings where shifts in power, suspected or real, can have swift and devastating consequences. </p> <p>\"Now don't try this at home,\" I keep on saying, panic mounting as I wish more and more that I had stuck to Epistemology or Philosophy of Mind. Fortunately I have Mo and Pete in the class. These are the steadiest men you could hope to meet, both well into their second decade of imprisonment. Men I admire. Both of them scholars who put me to shame. They try out the idea and try its fit into various contexts: apartheid South Africa, family, prison. Wayne, who has really taken a shine to my version of Socratic method harries them into explanations, forces the occasional pursed- lipped concession. Johnny and Steve are quiet, ironic observers, dropping in occasional gems or deflating absurdities. </p> <p>They watch me struggle to get a word in and smile as they see my temper going and language deteriorating. I was so unpleasant last week that I brought in a bag of sweets by way of apology. They are not impressed. \"He only bought these,\" Mo points out, \"because he was such a right bastard last time.\" </p> <p>After two hours of this I feel drained and buzzing all at once. I can't for the life of me see the point of locking up my philosophers. When I say this to my wife she gives me a very old-fashioned look indeed and warns me about going native. Too late. </p> <p>\u0095 Alan Smith teaches philosophy and English literature part-time at Wellingborough Prison.</p>",

Philosophy: it does have a bit of a ring to it, especially doing it in prison; it sounds rather wise, stately, a little bit superior. It didn't take long for us to leave that kind of nonsense behind. Wayne, direct as ever, gets us started. \"Come on then, Al, what's it all about, philosophy? How would you define it?\" I'm tempted to ask him, \"What do you mean, definition?\" but some merciful instinct for self-preservation stops me. They don't want some clever undergraduate posturing, these guys want an answer they can get a grip on right here and now so I tell them a bit about Socratic method, the method of the idiot child. \"You know,\" I tell them, \"when some daft kid keeps on asking, why? why?\" Yes, they know about that. \"Well that's all that philosophy is. Philosophers just ask why.\" There is a certain amount of storm to weather here. \"Is that it then? Is that all there is to it?\" \"Well, yes,\" I say, suddenly fearful that they will walk out on me and leave me to face Gwen with the ruin that I have made of her bright idea. All this was months ago now and I have settled down with a regular group of 12. People come and go as sentences end and new guys are shipped in and this means that there are quite regular crises as philosophy virgins are seduced into our strange ways. Philosophy has attracted men who have long sentences to serve and they bring into class the hard-faced generosity that gets them through the years. They say things that frighten me to death. Wayne on abortion: \"If we could turn back the years, Mark, wouldn't it be better, knowing as we do now that you were going to turn out to be a murdering nut-case who's been nothing but a drain on society, wouldn't aborting you have been a good idea?\" Dear God, I think, head in hands, he's gone too far this time. I ought to have warned him about all the trouble that Socrates was landed in by philosophy. But these guys are neighbours on the wing. They smile at each other. Sometimes, less often now, I get a bad time for being a weakling. \"For God's sake Al will you use your authority and sort these bastards out.\" \"I have no authority, I repudiate it, I spit on authority.\" \"Don't start all that shit,\" Pete tells me, knowing my game. \"Right,\" says Wayne, brusquely, \"come on let's get on with this.\" \"I'll read this next bit shall I,\" says Pete. I shrug and away we go. Wayne is a real asset; he just keeps on asking the obvious questions that no one else will ask for fear of looking stupid. He knows nothing. Or does he? Are his questions just a bit too good naturedly naive? I promise myself to get someone to have a peek in his pad where I suspect there are walls full of philosophy books. \"Hold on,\" he says, the devious Yorkshire simpleton, \"what's metaphysics then?\" Before I can tumble into his trap, Isaac turns to him and treats us all to a lucid, delightful explanation. Isaac is the youngest by far and can get terrible stick, but I suspect that he has just done himself a power of good. \"Right, OK,\" Wayne says, nodding gently into Isaac's beaming face. We have been talking about aesthetics for the past month or so. This has led us into censorship and this week we have been reading JM Coetzee on Taking Offence. Coetzee suggests that taking offence is a transaction where the powerful and the powerless exchange roles and potencies. Far too late it dawns on me that making this explicit could get one or two of the more idealistic guys into trouble back on the wings where shifts in power, suspected or real, can have swift and devastating consequences. \"Now don't try this at home,\" I keep on saying, panic mounting as I wish more and more that I had stuck to Epistemology or Philosophy of Mind. Fortunately I have Mo and Pete in the class. These are the steadiest men you could hope to meet, both well into their second decade of imprisonment. Men I admire. Both of them scholars who put me to shame. They try out the idea and try its fit into various contexts: apartheid South Africa, family, prison. Wayne, who has really taken a shine to my version of Socratic method harries them into explanations, forces the occasional pursed- lipped concession. Johnny and Steve are quiet, ironic observers, dropping in occasional gems or deflating absurdities. They watch me struggle to get a word in and smile as they see my temper going and language deteriorating. I was so unpleasant last week that I brought in a bag of sweets by way of apology. They are not impressed. \"He only bought these,\" Mo points out, \"because he was such a right bastard last time.\" After two hours of this I feel drained and buzzing all at once. I can't for the life of me see the point of locking up my philosophers. When I say this to my wife she gives me a very old-fashioned look indeed and warns me about going native. Too late. \u0095 Alan Smith teaches philosophy and English literature part-time at Wellingborough Prison.",

Racing Santander and Osasuna, 2nd and 3rd bottom, drew 1-1. Espanyol lost 2-1 at the hands of M\u00e1laga with old-boy Dario Silva inevitably on the score-sheet. Like Catanha last week, though, the Uruguayan didn't celebrate his strike. Speaking of Catanha - he's flying and so is his side Celta de Vigo. Deep in trouble in January, Celta have climbed ten places, and on Sunday they clocked up their fifth win on the trot, 2-1 against Athletic Bilbao. Catanha was on target again, heading home Gustavo L\u00f3pez's cross. \"Me and Gustavo understand each other perfectly\" cooed Catanha afterwards, \"I'm going to ask him to marry me\". Sloppy seconds Two more players obviously madly in love are Atl\u00e9tico Madrid's Jos\u00e9 Juan Luque and Oscar Mena. Atl\u00e9ti have been on fire since Christmas and promotion, getting closer by the week, looks an even stronger possibility now after their 2-1 win over second-placed Tenerife on Sunday. Luque and Mena were so delighted that a mere peck on the cheek really wouldn't do - Marca's front cover is (dis?)graced by a photo of the two indulging in what could mildly be described as a bit of a snog. Hollywood beckons - fancy playing Iker Casillas, boys?",

      "bodyText": "Carlton and Granada TV are poised to curb spending on OnDigital after completion of its ongoing strategic review. The announcement is expected to be made at ONdigital's quarterly subscription figures briefing in a fortnight's time. The two companies that control ITV are said to be concerned at the high levels of spending at ONdigital. At present, ONdigital is spending more than \u00a3300m a year on acquiring new customers, most of which is taken up by set-top box subsidies. It is thought ONdigital may be forced to slash subsidies on free set-top boxes, a move that could either lock ONdigital out of the digital market or prompt BSkyB to follow suit. Analysts, however, are not convinced BSkyB is likely to change its own set-top box subsidy strategy - at least not in this current box's lifetime. But the next generation of set-top boxes, expected at the end of this year, are not expected to be subsidised at all. ONdigital's quarterly subscriber announcement in two weeks' time is more likely to focus on reining in special subscription offers and pushing the cheaper option of integrated digital TVs, say analysts.

Of all the media coverage of cancer assessed by the study, a quarter was devoted to breast cancer (lung cancer got less than half that amount) while the number of celebrities involved was far higher (277 mentions) for breast cancer than for the 200 other types of known varieties. </p> <p>Much of this has come about through the vigorous campaigning of Breakthrough, the charity that launched its Fashion Targets Breast Cancer initiative with a posse of pert-breasted supermodels and celebrities. This, naturally enough, ensured a steady flow of high-profile media coverage. Whatever one thinks of the methodology, the results are impressive since the charity has already raised \u00a315m to launch a breast cancer research centre. </p> <p>Which brings us back to the Macmillan study. This reveals that there are more than 200 cancers, most of which are never debated in the media. Colorectal cancers, for example, got just 7% of the press coverage reviewed, yet bowel cancer is the third biggest killer. Could it be that breast cancer has become fashionable to the detriment of other types of cancer awareness? </p> <p>Delyth Morgan, chief executive of Breakthrough, refutes this. \"Seven years ago, when I started at Breakthrough, no one talked about cancer of any form, least of all breast cancer which was combining two taboos, sex and death. The Macmillan report reflects how successful we are. We learned the lessons of the Aids campaigners in the 80s and we have worked hard to present the issues creatively. For that reason, Breakthrough has become a trailblazer for all cancer charities and many have mimicked our style of campaigning.\" </p> <p>That much is certainly true: the Cancer Research Campaign recently produced a series of sexy ads featuring perfect bottoms to boost awareness of bowel cancer - but as yet there have been precious few glossy magazines fighting to give away black ribbons commemorating lung cancer awareness month, fewer still supermodels willing to adopt the disease as their pet charity. Well, they wouldn't, would they? That would mean stubbing out those super-chic, appetite-suppressing Marlboro Lights. </p> <p>Breast cancer kills more than 13,000 women every year in the UK and more than 30,000 are diagnosed as having it. However, the disease is most prevalent in women over 65, least common among those under 30. \"Our report shows that breast cancer awareness among the young is very high, thanks to these celebrity campaigns, and there is a very high degree of public interest and sympathy,\" says Deborah Lincoln of Macmillan. \"This is good because cancer is a long-term disease, so they will know what to look for when they're older. The problem is, even with breast cancer, no campaign or magazine is really reaching out to older women, the at-risk group.\" </p> <p>Certainly it is ironic that breast cancer is marketed as a young woman's disease, which it patently is not, while lung cancer is associated with elderly men. In fact lung cancer is rising among women at the rate of 11% per year, a pattern set to worsen given the high number of teenage girls who smoke. A recent study indicated that 33% of 11-15-year-old girls are regular smokers (far more than boys), many drawn by the promise of losing weight. So why are there no campaigns with glamorous spokesmodels getting the message through to them? </p> <p>Lincoln says wryly: \"Well, when you're 15, you think you're immortal, don't you? Getting the message through is never going to be easy, but added to that, there isn't the same media interest in lung cancer. There is far less public sympathy because many people take the view that sufferers of the disease are themselves to blame through smoking.\" </p> <p>It is worth noting, too, that most of the celebrities involved with cancer charities tend to be women. \"Men don't like talking about illness,\" Lincoln says. \"And a lot of men are embarrassed about talking about their nether regions. Even our prostate cancer helpline gets more calls from women than men, presumably wives phoning on behalf of their husbands. Robbie Williams has started campaigning for the Institute of Cancer Research and George Carman QC talked about his cancer before he died, so things are changing slowly.\" </p> <p>Morgan agrees. \"I don't know if I'd say cancer was a gender issue. There's a women's media that has given us opportunities to debate the disease. Now men's magazines are catching up and beginning to discuss health. Maybe we'll see more debate about other types of cancers among men.\"</p>",

Since the last academic year, rent rises for self-catering accommodation are particularly steep, up to 8% compared to a national inflation rate of 2.7%.

But the former cabinet minister steps down soon after half a century as an MP, with the ancient relationship still unchanged.</p> <p><b> October 21 1964</b></p> <p>I had to go to the privy council office for a rehearsal of the ceremony of admission into the privy council. We were greeted by the most awful stoogey-looking people. The rehearsal was terribly degrading as we were told that we had to kneel on a footstool before the Queen and assent to the privy council oath which had a real Mau-Mau quality. Charlie [Pannell] and I chattered during the rehearsal and tried to look as if we were not taking it too seriously. I'm afraid the officials were profoundly shocked. I made no attempt to conceal my feelings.</p> <p>Then we were driven to Buckingham Palace. An officer in breeches, spurs, a sword and full court dress greeted us and we went into a drawing room. Herbert Bowden, the new lord president of the council, was there, and I asked him whether I had to go through with it, as I did find the terms of the oath so degrading and distasteful. He said that he knew I would but that I had to do it because if I didn't I couldn't get cabinet papers. Many of the others with me felt the same but I suppose it was particularly unpleasant for me. Charlie said I ought to do it for the sake of the party and it was really for that reason that I did. I have always wanted to be a privy councillor because it is the greatest honour in the parliamentary field but when it came to it, it was terrible.</p> <p>We were summoned in one by one to the Queen's drawing room and she shook us by the hand. Then we stood in a row and the oath was administered to those who were swearing. I affirmed. I did it because I disapprove of a religious oath for any but religious purposes.</p> <p>We then went up to the Queen one after another, kneeling and picking up her hand and kissing it, and then bowing. I did the most miniature bow ever seen and returned to my line. When it was over she made a couple of remarks and we all walked by and shook hands. After that I had the oath of the postmaster general administered to me. I left the palace boiling with indignation and feeling that this was an attempt to impose tribal magic and personal loyalty on people whose real duty was only to their electors.</p> <p><b> February 23 1968</b></p> <p>At lunch I found myself sitting next to the Duke of Edinburgh. He wanted to connect the monarchy more directly with ministers and said he thought that privy councils were an absolute waste of time; that the PM's audience with the Queen should be broadened out to include other ministers who could explain things to her. He thought the ombudsman should have been put into the royal household to make the monarchy seem closer to the people and to represent the nation. The duke said he acted as a sort of unofficial ombudsman and I think he does. I tried to point out that the monarchy was linked in many people's minds with a lot of reactionary forces.</p> <p><b> July 11 1969</b></p> <p>At lunch, the Queen was very pleasant. I asked her if royalty had to be so formal. The Queen said that it is just that you have to dress up and be told what to do for privy council. Obviously, she did not like the suggestion the thing was more formal than necessary</p> <p><b> October 6 1969</b></p> <p>Harold warned me on Saturday that I might have to go to Balmoral to kiss hands with the Queen on appointment, and I said, \"How ridiculous. I can't anyway, I'm going to Telford.\" He said, \"Well, the palace insist.\" In the end I got out of it, but not without a very sharp exchange with the privy council office.

      "bodyText": "To scrap government ministers' oath of personal loyalty to the Queen has been among Tony Benn's dearest wishes, as these early political diaries show. But the former cabinet minister steps down soon after half a century as an MP, with the ancient relationship still unchanged. October 21 1964 I had to go to the privy council office for a rehearsal of the ceremony of admission into the privy council. We were greeted by the most awful stoogey-looking people. The rehearsal was terribly degrading as we were told that we had to kneel on a footstool before the Queen and assent to the privy council oath which had a real Mau-Mau quality. Charlie [Pannell] and I chattered during the rehearsal and tried to look as if we were not taking it too seriously. I'm afraid the officials were profoundly shocked. I made no attempt to conceal my feelings. Then we were driven to Buckingham Palace. An officer in breeches, spurs, a sword and full court dress greeted us and we went into a drawing room. Herbert Bowden, the new lord president of the council, was there, and I asked him whether I had to go through with it, as I did find the terms of the oath so degrading and distasteful. He said that he knew I would but that I had to do it because if I didn't I couldn't get cabinet papers. Many of the others with me felt the same but I suppose it was particularly unpleasant for me. Charlie said I ought to do it for the sake of the party and it was really for that reason that I did. I have always wanted to be a privy councillor because it is the greatest honour in the parliamentary field but when it came to it, it was terrible. We were summoned in one by one to the Queen's drawing room and she shook us by the hand. Then we stood in a row and the oath was administered to those who were swearing. I affirmed. I did it because I disapprove of a religious oath for any but religious purposes. We then went up to the Queen one after another, kneeling and picking up her hand and kissing it, and then bowing. I did the most miniature bow ever seen and returned to my line. When it was over she made a couple of remarks and we all walked by and shook hands. After that I had the oath of the postmaster general administered to me. I left the palace boiling with indignation and feeling that this was an attempt to impose tribal magic and personal loyalty on people whose real duty was only to their electors. February 23 1968 At lunch I found myself sitting next to the Duke of Edinburgh. He wanted to connect the monarchy more directly with ministers and said he thought that privy councils were an absolute waste of time; that the PM's audience with the Queen should be broadened out to include other ministers who could explain things to her. He thought the ombudsman should have been put into the royal household to make the monarchy seem closer to the people and to represent the nation. The duke said he acted as a sort of unofficial ombudsman and I think he does. I tried to point out that the monarchy was linked in many people's minds with a lot of reactionary forces. July 11 1969 At lunch, the Queen was very pleasant. I asked her if royalty had to be so formal. The Queen said that it is just that you have to dress up and be told what to do for privy council. Obviously, she did not like the suggestion the thing was more formal than necessary October 6 1969 Harold warned me on Saturday that I might have to go to Balmoral to kiss hands with the Queen on appointment, and I said, \"How ridiculous. I can't anyway, I'm going to Telford.\" He said, \"Well, the palace insist.\" In the end I got out of it, but not without a very sharp exchange with the privy council office. I was damned if I was going to waste a whole day. October 22 1969 I went to Buckingham Palace to be sworn in. Godfrey Agnew, who was clerk of the privy council, said how very upset the Queen had been at the newspaper story that other ministers who had gone up [to Balmoral] had not enjoyed it and had thought it a waste of time. Here was a man trying to preserve the monarchy on the basis that you couldn't conceivably discuss it, because if you did, its authority might be undermined.

But it said vaccination was still not on the cards: \"These are contingency plans but there have been no field trials. We are not considering it at this stage.\"</p> <p>Extra troops were drafted into Scotland yesterday as the disease was confirmed at farms many miles from previous outbreaks. Until the weekend, Scottish cases had been confined to a relatively small area of Dumfries and Galloway and there was a wide belief that the disease there was being contained.</p> <p>But new cases in Jedburgh and Hownam, between 25 and 30 miles from previously confirmed cases, have provoked an immediate revision of the operation.</p> <p>The Scottish rural affairs minister, Ross Finnie, travelled to the newly infected area to assess the \"very worrying\" development.</p> <p>The distance between the new outbreak and the previously isolated infection area is thought to be too far for the disease to have been carried in the air. The National Farmers' Union in Scotland said it suspected the virus had been transferred by people or on farm vehicles.</p> <p>Ten farms adjoining the infected ones will now have 12,000 sheep and 2,500 cattle slaughtered.</p> <p>As farmers' unions in Wales warned that their members were losing confidence in the government's ability to eliminate foot and mouth, the number of animals authorised for slaughter reached 1,366,000 - of which 888,000 had been killed. The minister of agriculture, Nick Brown, told MPs that the number waiting to be culled had risen to a record 478,000. Maff admitted it might have to store dead animals in sealed skips to cope with the backlog of 329,000 animals awaiting disposal.</p> <p>Yesterday there were 22 new cases by 8pm, mostly in Cumbria and southern Scotland, bringing the total number of outbreaks across the country to 1,157. It is widely feared that most of the unique hill sheep of the Lake District will not survive. There have been nine confirmed cases within the national park, including near Bassenthwaite, Keswick and on common land on the fells. Yesterday a case was confirmed under Skiddaw mountain.</p> <p>The council for national parks said four parks were now infected with 17 separate outbreaks, including six in the Yorkshire Dales. The charity predicted the loss of traditional farming methods, threatening dramatic changes to Britain's upland landscape, a high failure rate among small businesses and the collapse of support services.</p> <p>But organised opposition to the EU slaughter-only policy is mounting. In the Netherlands, where there have been 18 confirmed cases, riot police used water cannon to disperse 200 angry farmers calling for vaccination, and in Britain the government was accused of acting illegally by forcing farmers to hand over healthy animals to be culled.</p> <p>One campaign group, Stop Animal Deaths, said \"scores\" of people were prepared to defy moves to kill uninfected livestock. And Britain's 3,000 organic farmers were urged by the Soil Association to make a stand against the slaughter policy. The association set up a group called Farmers for Voluntary Vaccination and accused NFU leaders of suppressing the case for vaccination and leaving members \"fearful and misinformed\".</p> <p>\"They have failed to explain to members the virtues of potential alternatives,\" said a spokesman, Patrick Holden. \"We must never again be forced to witness this medieval slaughter\".</p> <p>Mr Brown told the House of Commons he hoped it would soon be possible to start lifting some of the restrictions on livestock movement and urged farmers to cooperate fully with the mass slaughter policy. Vaccination of livestock remained an option, he said. \"But it would be a major step to take, with significant consequences.\" <br><br></p> <p><b>Email update</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/email\">Sign up for our free daily foot and mouth round-up</a><br><br><b>More on the election and foot and mouth</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/footandmouth\">Politics: foot and mouth</a></p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/list\">Full list: outbreaks </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,464555,00.html\">Grap h: rise in cases</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,460510,00.html\">Full list: closed &amp; cancelled</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\">Causes and effects</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/theissues/article/0,6512,441031,00.html  \">The issue explained</a><br> <br> <b>The front line: meet those affected by the crisis</b><br> <a href=\"   http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,467836,00.html\">03.04.2001: Straws in the wind</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html\">06.03. 2001: Meet our panel</a><br> <br> <b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,470556,00.html\">09.04. 2001: Councils refusing to reopen footpaths</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,470612,00.html\">09.04. 2001: Hopes raised as figures for new cases stay stable</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,469559,00.html\">06.04. 2001: \u00a3120m boost for tourism</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,469518,00.html\">06.04. 2001, comment: Pig in the middle</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,469265,00.html\">06.04. 2001: Burial mound suggested to cut west's surplus of carcasses</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,469284,00.html\">06.04. 2001: Man shot in head with bolt gun dies</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,469370,00.html\">06.04. 2001, analysis: No reason to be cheerful -

A team of people from the Scottish Agricultural College is recruiting up to 225 people and the first exercise has taken place in Dumfries and Galloway, where there have been more than 130 outbreaks so far. The recruits are being divided into 75 teams and will coordinate and vaccinate in infected areas if the decision is made to take this route.

The National Farmers' Union in Scotland said it suspected the virus had been transferred by people or on farm vehicles. Ten farms adjoining the infected ones will now have 12,000 sheep and 2,500 cattle slaughtered. As farmers' unions in Wales warned that their members were losing confidence in the government's ability to eliminate foot and mouth, the number of animals authorised for slaughter reached 1,366,000 - of which 888,000 had been killed. The minister of agriculture, Nick Brown, told MPs that the number waiting to be culled had risen to a record 478,000. Maff admitted it might have to store dead animals in sealed skips to cope with the backlog of 329,000 animals awaiting disposal. Yesterday there were 22 new cases by 8pm, mostly in Cumbria and southern Scotland, bringing the total number of outbreaks across the country to 1,157. It is widely feared that most of the unique hill sheep of the Lake District will not survive. There have been nine confirmed cases within the national park, including near Bassenthwaite, Keswick and on common land on the fells. Yesterday a case was confirmed under Skiddaw mountain. The council for national parks said four parks were now infected with 17 separate outbreaks, including six in the Yorkshire Dales. The charity predicted the loss of traditional farming methods, threatening dramatic changes to Britain's upland landscape, a high failure rate among small businesses and the collapse of support services. But organised opposition to the EU slaughter-only policy is mounting. In the Netherlands, where there have been 18 confirmed cases, riot police used water cannon to disperse 200 angry farmers calling for vaccination, and in Britain the government was accused of acting illegally by forcing farmers to hand over healthy animals to be culled. One campaign group, Stop Animal Deaths, said \"scores\" of people were prepared to defy moves to kill uninfected livestock. And Britain's 3,000 organic farmers were urged by the Soil Association to make a stand against the slaughter policy. The association set up a group called Farmers for Voluntary Vaccination and accused NFU leaders of suppressing the case for vaccination and leaving members \"fearful and misinformed\". \"They have failed to explain to members the virtues of potential alternatives,\" said a spokesman, Patrick Holden. \"We must never again be forced to witness this medieval slaughter\". Mr Brown told the House of Commons he hoped it would soon be possible to start lifting some of the restrictions on livestock movement and urged farmers to cooperate fully with the mass slaughter policy. Vaccination of livestock remained an option, he said. \"But it would be a major step to take, with significant consequences.\" Email update Sign up for our free daily foot and mouth round-up More on the election and foot and mouth Politics: foot and mouth What's going on?

But however much the royals despise certain sections of the press, they reluctantly admit they cannot do without them. Each time the Queen, Charles, Andrew or any of the rest of the clan appears in public, reporters are invited along to publicise their good deeds. At the heart of coverage of royal events is the so-called rota system - the way in which Buckingham Palace tries to keep reporters, photographers and television journalists under control. Each time any royal appears at a public engagement a number of passes are given out to journalists. Every event - no matter how small or boring - is covered by a Press Association reporter, usually the court or deputy court correspondent, who files copy for the wire service available for other news organisations to use. It is at the discretion of the palace to decide how many other reporters can cover the event. The Queen prefers to carry out her duties without too many members of Her Majesty's press hanging around, so often the PA reporter will be the only one at an event. On the other hand, Prince Charles' officials are usually happy to create good PR by allowing the tabloids, the broadsheets and television crews in to record his duties. Passes for Princess Anne are given out only rarely, partly because her schedule is just too hectic, but mainly because there is little press interest in her engagements. But even if a reporter manages to gets his or her grubby hands on a pass, access to the royals is still not guaranteed. A fixed point pass usually gives standing room on the pavement, caged in a press pen, as the royal cavalcade sweeps past. Much more coveted is a rota pass, which enables the reporter to follow the royal as they tour an event and even listen in on their conversations. But the unwritten rule still applies: no questions are to be put directly to a royal - except on occasion by an uncouth television reporter. When Charles hosted a dinner last month at St James's Palace for Prince's Trust ambassadors, including Geri Halliwell and Elton John, around 50 journalists were there to record the event. But only one - a Press Association news reporter - was allowed inside the actual party. Another PA reporter and six national newspaper reporters were given rota passes allowing them to stand inside the door and question the celebrities as they arrived. Three television crews were allowed to stand just outside the doors to film the arrivals. Photographers with rota passes stood behind barricades on either side of the door, while the snappers with fixed point passes stood even further back. News organisations are also invited to cover royal tours abroad and journalists often travel with the royal party on their plane. This can be one of the rare times that the press get to speak directly to a royal, if he or she comes to the back of the aircraft for an informal and off-the-record chat.

      "body": "<p>The United States was born out of a profound distrust of government. The founding fathers had had a belly full of monarchs and their self-proclaimed divine right to rule. That fundamental suspicion underlies the modern nation like a geological fault, which breaks to the surface intermittently and unpredictably as a reminder of the country's uneasy relationship with federal power.</p> <p>The remnants of distrust are everywhere - the legislative gridlock that is all but assured by the checks and balances built into the political system; the jealousy with which many Americans hoard their weapons, lest they be intimidated by Washington's armed legions. Then there are the rural militias training in the hills for the day when they have to confront the United Nations and its supposed plot to establish a single world government.</p> <p>The suspicion does not run wide - these fears are shared by a small if significant minority - but it does run deep. And nowhere is it more apparent than in the corrosive paranoia of conspiracy theories that spring up through every crack in normal life.</p> <p>There are of course the persistent conspiracy theories surrounding the assassination of President Kennedy and the belief that the US government has been consorting with aliens, whose spacecraft are parked in the mysterious Area 51 near Roswell, Nevada.</p> <p>The UFO conspiracy theory has been fed and watered by the X-Files series on television, in which two FBI agents struggle ceaselessly to unveil the Byzantine plot woven around them. Now the same channel on which the show appears, Rupert Murdoch's Fox network, has dusted off a paranoid fantasy which is even more bizarre. It has just aired a portentous, documentary-style programme with the chilling title: \"Conspiracy theory: Did we land on the moon?\"</p> <p>Yes, many people in this country believe that Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and all the rest walked, not on the moon, but on a huge artificially-lit studio somewhere in Nevada. This suspicious minority amounts to 20% of the population, according to the programme, which gave the convoluted theory a full and reverent hearing.</p> <p>Those watching at home with gaping mouths were told how the Nasa hoax could be unmasked with a simple magnifying glass. The pictures taken on the \"moon\" showed light coming from different angles. Some details, apparently in deep shadow, were mysteriously illuminated. Some of the crosshairs on the famous moon photograph seemed to be behind objects in the foreground. The American flag appeared to flutter, despite the absence of air.</p> <p>The US, we were told, realised it could not keep up with the Soviets in the space race, so Nasa simply faked it. At best, the astronauts simply orbited the earth a few times and came back. At worst, they never left the earth and instead headed straight to the Nevada studio.</p> <p>The embattled Nasa spokesman who was asked to rebut the claims on air was left groping for words. \"Claptrap\" was his final verdict. Subsequent demolitions of the Fox evidence appeared on Nasa's site and other serious astronomical websites.</p> <p>To begin with, there is more than one light source on the moon. Light is reflected by the earth and from the moon's own pale surface. It can illuminate objects, even those apparently in deep shadow, from different directions.</p> <p>Moreover, on rudimentary black and white film, the light from very bright objects can bleed over and erase fine lines in the foreground, like crosshairs. And flags can flutter in a vacuum, especially when the flagpole is being handled by an astronaut.</p> <p>Such mundane explanations do not seem to have the same penetrating power as conspiracy theories. A cursory check of a popular internet chatroom, where television output is constantly discussed, suggested that paranoia was fast taking the upper hand.</p> <p>One chatter calling himself \"seeker\" (presumably after truth) expressed a widely shared sentiment when he said: \"I WANT TO BELIEVE that we've been to the moon and that Nasa has been completely up front with us on the subject.

      "bodyText": "The United States was born out of a profound distrust of government. The founding fathers had had a belly full of monarchs and their self-proclaimed divine right to rule. That fundamental suspicion underlies the modern nation like a geological fault, which breaks to the surface intermittently and unpredictably as a reminder of the country's uneasy relationship with federal power. The remnants of distrust are everywhere - the legislative gridlock that is all but assured by the checks and balances built into the political system; the jealousy with which many Americans hoard their weapons, lest they be intimidated by Washington's armed legions. Then there are the rural militias training in the hills for the day when they have to confront the United Nations and its supposed plot to establish a single world government. The suspicion does not run wide - these fears are shared by a small if significant minority - but it does run deep. And nowhere is it more apparent than in the corrosive paranoia of conspiracy theories that spring up through every crack in normal life. There are of course the persistent conspiracy theories surrounding the assassination of President Kennedy and the belief that the US government has been consorting with aliens, whose spacecraft are parked in the mysterious Area 51 near Roswell, Nevada. The UFO conspiracy theory has been fed and watered by the X-Files series on television, in which two FBI agents struggle ceaselessly to unveil the Byzantine plot woven around them. Now the same channel on which the show appears, Rupert Murdoch's Fox network, has dusted off a paranoid fantasy which is even more bizarre. It has just aired a portentous, documentary-style programme with the chilling title: \"Conspiracy theory: Did we land on the moon?\" Yes, many people in this country believe that Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and all the rest walked, not on the moon, but on a huge artificially-lit studio somewhere in Nevada. This suspicious minority amounts to 20% of the population, according to the programme, which gave the convoluted theory a full and reverent hearing. Those watching at home with gaping mouths were told how the Nasa hoax could be unmasked with a simple magnifying glass. The pictures taken on the \"moon\" showed light coming from different angles. Some details, apparently in deep shadow, were mysteriously illuminated. Some of the crosshairs on the famous moon photograph seemed to be behind objects in the foreground. The American flag appeared to flutter, despite the absence of air. The US, we were told, realised it could not keep up with the Soviets in the space race, so Nasa simply faked it. At best, the astronauts simply orbited the earth a few times and came back. At worst, they never left the earth and instead headed straight to the Nevada studio. The embattled Nasa spokesman who was asked to rebut the claims on air was left groping for words. \"Claptrap\" was his final verdict. Subsequent demolitions of the Fox evidence appeared on Nasa's site and other serious astronomical websites. To begin with, there is more than one light source on the moon. Light is reflected by the earth and from the moon's own pale surface. It can illuminate objects, even those apparently in deep shadow, from different directions. Moreover, on rudimentary black and white film, the light from very bright objects can bleed over and erase fine lines in the foreground, like crosshairs. And flags can flutter in a vacuum, especially when the flagpole is being handled by an astronaut. Such mundane explanations do not seem to have the same penetrating power as conspiracy theories. A cursory check of a popular internet chatroom, where television output is constantly discussed, suggested that paranoia was fast taking the upper hand. One chatter calling himself \"seeker\" (presumably after truth) expressed a widely shared sentiment when he said: \"I WANT TO BELIEVE that we've been to the moon and that Nasa has been completely up front with us on the subject. But if Nasa lied about something as big as the moon landings, who knows where the lies end and the truth begins.\" That is precisely the question posed by Bill Kaysing, the \"star\" witness in the Fox expos\u00e9 and author of the topic's definitive work, We Never Went to the Moon. \"This whole moon business goes much further than Nasa, he said. In fact: \"Nasa and the CIA and the whole US government is a rotten and corrupt organisation, designed just to get all the tax money they can out of people, to manipulate their minds, to keep them amused with sporting events and silly TV sitcoms.\" Not to mention quasi-documentaries broadcast by Rupert Murdoch, friend of governments around the world.

      "bodyText": "A Spanish restaurant worker named as the chief suspect in the murder of British schoolgirl Caroline Dickinson has been arrested by police in Florida, it was reported early today. Francisco Arce Montez, 50, was arrested by Miami Beach police last month after allegedly breaking into a woman's apartment attempting to commit what is described as a lewd and lascivious act while she slept, according to a BBC report. Caroline, 13, was raped and smothered to death in bed in the dormitory of a French youth hostel during a school trip in 1996. She and 40 other children were in the middle of an activity week at Pleine Fougeres in Brittany when an intruder entered their unlocked hostel in the early hours of July 18 and murdered the teenager. An inquest ruled last week that her death was the result of unlawful killing. More than 3,500 DNA samples have been taken by French police involved in the investigation and 2,000 lines of enquiry have been followed up but the killer has never been caught. Mr Montez was recently named as the chief suspect by Francis Debons, the French judge leading the investigation into Caroline's murder. He has been kept in Miami Dade county jail since his arrest on March 11 after being refused bail because he was a flight risk. French consular officials in Miami said tests were being carried out on a sample of his DNA to see if it matched evidence from the scene of Caroline's murder in France. It is hoped the DNA test will determine whether there is sufficient evidence to begin extradition proceedings, the BBC reported. Mr Montez was reportedly being hunted by French police because they believe he had a history of sexual assaults, and described his method of operation as being similar to that of Caroline's killer. At last week's inquest into Caroline's death her father, John Dickinson, made a renewed appeal for help in solving the case.

In the first 1974 election, it was believed, not least by bookmakers, that they would finally break through and win 30 or even 50 seats. As I happily remember, that February you could back them at 16-1 to win between 11 and 20 seats. In the event they won 14, despite their 19.3% of the vote.

When Disraeli said that England did not love coalitions, he was being glib, but he had a point.

The first phase of the study consisted of a survey of more than 3,000 electors, a sample three times larger than the average opinion poll. It is now complete and offers a snapshot of the state of opinion just prior to what is assumed to be the start of the official campaign.</p> <p>One question in the survey asks the public to identify the \"single most important issue in the general election\".

Clearly, the jewel in the crown of public performance evaluations is the economy. More than half the electorate (56%) say they think the government has handled the economy well and only 14% badly.

Performance on the most important issue, the NHS, gets a much less positive evaluation. Voters who think that the government has done badly in its stewardship of the NHS outnumber those who think it has performed well by some 15% - 31% compared with 46%.

Labour did rather badly on the issue when it was in opposition - arguably it was the failing issue for the party - and so it is interesting to note that it gets a modestly positive evaluation at the present time. Some 34% think the government has done a good job and 31% think the opposite, which effectively neutralises the issue during the forthcoming election campaign. William Hague and the Conservatives are going to have a hard time making progress with accusations of stealth taxes when attitudes to the government's performance are generally favourable.</p> <p>On crime performance, Labour gets a poor rating. About 29% of electors think that the government has done a good job while 41% think the opposite. Some people have argued that although the home secretary, Jack Straw, is disliked for his illiberal policies by many middle-class Labour supporters, this does not count since he really goes down well among working-class voters who live at the sharp end of the battle against crime. Actually the evidence points to the opposite conclusion. Some 33% of middle-class professionals think that the government has done badly on crime compared with 48% of manual workers.

After foot and mouth, that missed opportunity has become even more urgent. They talk of protecting wildlife, yet revive road building in sensitive areas. This, along with World Trade Organisation protests, will guarantee a stormy future. The government has seemed so shaky recently because it has failed to grasp that these issues are connected and people feel very deeply about them. They have been taken by surprise each time and acted defensively, like abolishing the fuel escalator tax and then for good measure appeasing \"motorists\" by freeing up millions for environmentally damaging road schemes. They cannot go on missing the connections that are being made by ordinary electors looking for a better quality of life. Developing stronger environmental politics is the key. Foot and mouth has as made it clear we cannot treat the countryside as a food factory. It is a life resource, just as essential to the quality of life of townsfolk as to the biodiversity of the planet. ros@roscoward.demon.co.uk",

      "body": "<b> 56 Tess Kingham MP </b> <br> <b>Labour, Gloucester</b> <p> I led a campaign involving Gloucester people, local media and health workers to get a new hospital for the city. We will have a new A&amp;E department, children's centre and maternity services - proving that if politicians and local people lobby together, you get results. </p> <p> <b> 57 Andrew Lansley MP </b><br><b>Shadow cabinet office minister</b> <br><b>Conservative, South Cambridgeshire</b> </p> <p> During debates on the protection of children bill, I pressed the government to exempt voluntary organisations from charges. I continued to argue with ministers, and persuaded my Conservative colleagues and William Hague to support this exemption. On the day William said we would exempt volunteers from charges, the government itself, contrary to its previous arguments, agreed to the exemption. </p> <p> <b> 58 Edward Leigh MP</b><br><b> Conservative, Gainsborough</b> </p> <p> The defence of freedom has been my main goal. Freedom of religion for persecuted Christians across the world with three adjournment debates, freedom for religious institutions to employ believers, freedom for people to continue minority pursuits. The Guardian sketchwriter has acknowledged my continual questioning of ministers and I have worked for the protection of human life in opposing embryonic cloning. </p> <p><b>59 William Hague MP</b><br><b>Leader of the Opposition</b><br><b> Conservative, Richmond</b></p> <p>With the help of my parliamentary colleagues and many others, we have rebuilt the Conservative party, reformed its organisation, reconnected with the mainstream majority of the country and put ourselves in a position where we can definitely win the next election.</p> <p><b> 60 Peter Lilley MP</b><br><b> Conservative, Hitchin and Harpenden</b> </p> <p> Forcing the government to change its policy on building on green fields, which I hope will disrupt plans, previously steamrollered through by local Labour and Lib Dem councillors and endorsed by Prescott, to build 10,000 homes on the green belt in my constituency. </p> <p> <b> 61 Martin Linton MP</b><br><b> Labour, Battersea</b> </p> <p> I've contributed to 15 reports of the home affairs committee, edited a book of ideas for a second term, won amendments to the Political Parties Act, helped secure the future of New Covent Garden Market, affordable housing in riverside developments, and progress towards a London Orbital railway. Not earth-shaking, but far more than I achieved as a Guardian reporter. </p> <p> <b> 62 Fiona Mactaggart MP</b><br><b> Labour, Slough</b> </p> <p> I secured a clause in the Immigration and Asylum Act retaining the right of appeal against deportation for people who have lived here for more than seven years. I have persuaded Berkshire Health Authority to do more to tackle the poor health of Slough. </p> <p> <b> 63 Ken Maginnis MP</b><br><b> Ulster Unionist, Fermanagh and South Tyrone</b> </p> <p> The 1998 Belfast Agreement, even with its inevitable flaws. No more articles 2 and 3; international recognition of our place in the UK; a devolved legislature; political murders dropping from a 26-yearly average of 110 to single figures. It's a start. </p> <p> <b> 64 Humfrey Malins MP</b><br><b> Conservative, Woking</b> </p> <p> Battling for a civilian Gulf war veteran, terribly ill after exposure to depleted uranium shells and always positive in outlook. I persuaded the defence minister to take a personal interest and even raised the matter with the prime minister at Question Time and got a personal response from him about the case. </p> <p> <b> 65 Christine McCafferty MP</b><br><b> Labour, Calder Valley</b> </p> <p> Successful campaigns to reduce VAT on sanitary products, which were previously tax-rated as luxury items; for an open public inquiry on Harold Shipman that would include my constituents in Todmorden; and for inclusion of bio-diversity action plans in the countryside and rights of way bill. </p> <p> <b> 66 Siobhain McDonagh MP </b><br><b>Labour, Mitcham and Morden</b> </p> <p> London Electricity threatened a local charitable trust, which houses elderly people, with a bill for \u00a360,000 for the installation of central heating. After I had managed to get an adjournment debate and the London Evening Standard had picked up the story, London Electricity backed down and installed the heating for free. </p> <p> <b> 67 Kevin McNamara MP</b><br><b> Labour, Hull North</b> </p> <p> I put the final nail in the coffin of capital punishment by moving the amendment to include protocol 6 (which prohibits the death penalty) to the human rights bill. To reintroduce capital punishment Britain would have to resile from the whole Convention, as it gives no opportunity for a signatory state to derogate from protocol 6. </p> <p> <b> 68 Michael Meacher MP </b><br><b>Environment minister </b><br><b>Labour, Oldham West and Royton</b> </p> <p> The Countryside Act 2000; raising the profile of the environment throughout the country; international campaigning for action to combat global warming; a commitment to abolish fuel poverty by 2010; and setting a statutory target to triple recycling nationwide within five years. </p> <p> <b> 69 Andrew Miller MP Labour</b><br><b> Ellesmere Port and Neston</b> </p> <p> Winning a six-year battle to get a constituent's relative out of a UN refugee camp on the Thai/Burmese border. A drop in the ocean compared to the suffering in Burma, but I will never forget the family's tears of joy as she landed in the UK. </p> <p> <b> 70 Ray Michie MP</b><br><b> Liberal Democrat, Argyll and Bute</b> </p> <p> I campaigned for many years, as my father, Lord Bannerman of Kildonan, did before me, for the re-establishment of the Scottish Parliament. My greatest moment of satisfaction was the passing of the Scotland Act 1998. Clause 1 says it all: \"There shall be a Scottish Parliament.\" </p> <p> <b> 71 Dan Norris MP</b><br><b> Labour, Wansdyke</b> </p> <p> My proudest achievement has been bringing national charities, the Home Office, local government and Wansdyke businesses together to protect children. Copies of Protecting Our Children - a booklet which advises parents on how they can effectively prevent their children being sexually abused - have been distributed to every family with children in Somerset and the former Avon. All free of charge. </p> <p> <b> 72 Lembit \u00d6pik MP</b><br><b> Liberal Democrat, Montgomeryshire</b> </p> <p> I know I do big campaigns like asteroid threats, fox hunting and all that. But really, it's about individuals: like hip operations, CSA issues, housing crises, farming problems. Not UK front-page news, or Newsnight stuff. But it touches real people. If folk feel I've made their life better in a way they can point to, I'd be very proud. </p> <p> <b> 73 Diana Organ MP Labour</b><br><b> Forest of Dean</b> </p> <p> I have set up a hysterectomies group to empower women and bring the issue of unnecessary hysterectomies to public attention. Lobbied for the development of a landscape of national importance for the Forest of Dean. Gained a commitment from the prime minister to sort out the long campaign on Freeminers' rights. </p> <p> <b> 74 Richard Ottaway MP</b><br><b> Conservative, Croydon South</b> </p> <p> I stopped the development of the Medium Secure Unit for the mentally impaired next to three primary schools in Coulsdon, to the relief of parents in Croydon. On behalf of pensioners nationwide I brought the government to account over its handling of Equitable Life. And I finally cracked Mrs Johnson's social security claim. </p> <p> <b> 75 Gordon Prentice MP</b><br><b> Labour, Pendle</b> </p> <p> I put forward my right to roam bill in an effort to encourage the government to open up the countryside. I was happy to withdraw it when the government decided at long last to bring in its own bill. </p> <p> <b> 76 John Redwood MP</b><br><b> Conservative, Wokingham</b> </p> <p> I am proud to have been part of the opposition getting people to understand that this government is all spin and no substance. I enjoyed leading a campaign to give the motorist a better deal in Parliament. My proudest moment was when I asked the chancellor what the price of petrol was and he was unable to answer. </p> <p> <b> 77 David Rendel MP</b><br><b> Liberal Democrat, Newbury</b> </p> <p> My most significant action was to get the National Audit Office to investigate the Conservative government's failure to publicise the halving of widows' Serps entitlements. This prompted the Labour government to exempt all those reaching pension age by October 5 2002 and thereafter to phase the changes in gradually, at a cost of \u00a312bn. </p> <p> <b> 78 Marion Roe MP</b><br><b> Conservative, Broxbourne</b> </p> <p> Since 1997 I have raised the issues surrounding installation of telecommunications masts with ministers many times. Last year I sponsored the launch of Mast Action UK, a charity that promotes the sensible siting of masts. I have succeeded in persuading both the Labour government and the Conservative party to adopt policies that give greater consultation opportunity to the affected community. </p> <p> <b> 79 Andrew Rowe MP</b><br><b>Conservative, Faversham and Mid Kent</b> </p> <p> JC2000, which I invented and chaired, introduced 6.5m children in 18,250 schools and their parents to the true meaning of the millennium. As co-chair of the UK Youth Parliament. I have also helped to establish the first national representative voice for people under 18. </p> <p> <b> 80 Mohammed Sarwar MP</b><br><b> Labour, Glasgow Govan</b> </p> <p> The successful campaign I led with shop stewards to win orders for Govan shipyard. We lobbied cabinet ministers and campaigned across Scotland, gathering 80,000 signatures on a petition supporting the yard. The government listened and delivered vital work. We fought for Govan and won. </p> <p> <b> 81 Alan Simpson MP</b><br><b> Labour, Nottingham South</b> </p> <p> All my best shots have been about sustainability. The Warm Homes Act was passed after years of campaigning; challenging GM crops (in the courts and in the country) has been exhilarating; and my private bill to eliminate food poverty in Britain gives a lot of work to look forward to. </p> <p> <b> 82 Rev Martin Smyth MP</b><br><b> Ulster Unionist, Belfast South</b> </p> <p> My adjournment debate in Westminster Hall was the first in a political forum to highlight the representation of minorities in the Molucca islands by Islamic extremists. The Indonesian government is aware of world concerns and some succour and mediation has eased the situation. </p> <p> <b> 83 Nicholas Soames MP </b><br><b>Conservative, Mid Sussex</b> </p> <p> I'm proud just to have been a member of parliament and looked after the interests of those who elected me. </p> <p><b> 84 Richard Spring MP</b><br><b>Conservative, West Suffolk</b> When I was deputy shadow culture, media and sport minister I constantly badgered the BBC and ITV about the way they used to just trot out government statistics which were treble counted. In the end, Trevor MacDonald's Tonight programme ran a show on it, and I asked a question at PMQs that embarrassed Blair, and now they've stopped using the figures.</p> <p> <b> 85 Dr Phyllis Starkey MP</b><br><b> Labour, Milton Keynes South West</b> </p> <p> Milton Keynes is a young city. I highlighted the risk to young people's safety from unregulated bouncers at pubs and clubs with my private member's bill calling for a national registration scheme for bouncers. This is now part of government legislation. </p> <p> <b> 86 Ian Stewart MP</b><br><b> Labour, Eccles</b> </p> <p> I have campaigned with other MPs and families to secure a fair deal from government for victims of vaccine damage. Success was achieved when the government increased the payment to \u00a3100,000 equivalent for each damaged child, backdated for children already compensated at lower levels. </p> <p> <b> 87 Gavin Strang MP</b><br><b>Labour Edinburgh East and Musselburgh</b> </p> <p> As transport minister I introduced the rural bus subsidy scheme, providing 1,800 new bus services and 16m passenger journeys last year. As chair of the Craigmillar social inclusion partnership board, I am involved in the regeneration of this deprived area in my constituency. </p> <p> <b> 88 Gisela Stuart MP, junior health minister</b><br><b> Labour, Birmingham Edgbaston</b> </p> <p> The two things I am proudest of having achieved are serving on the social security select committee and helping to bring about legislation which allows for fairer divisions of pensions on divorce, and succeeding in getting legislation which makes kerbcrawling an arrestable offence. </p> <p> <b> 89 John Swinney MP</b><br><b> Leader, SNP</b><br><b> Tayside North</b> </p> <p> Contributing to the establishment of the first Scottish Parliament for 300 years. But on a more human level, MPs can genuinely make a difference to the lives of constituents: I still remember helping to secure \u00a318,000 compensation from the Child Support Agency for a mother who was desperately in need of the money. </p> <p> <b> 90 Teddy Taylor MP</b><br><b>Conservative, Rochford and Southend East</b> </p> <p> As democracy has declined, the main achievements of MPs today are either as social workers or community interventionists. Among my achievements since 1997 is inviting a young man who was about to commit suicide to give me a week to solve his problems, and contacting him after six days to say those problems had been solved. </p> <p> <b> 91 Peter Temple-Morris</b><br><b> MP Labour, Leominster</b> </p> <p> For me the 1997 Parliament has been essentially personal. After some trauma early on I crossed the floor and joined the Parliamentary Labour party. I have achieved political peace of mind, a marvellous thing for which I am deeply grateful to the PLP. </p> <p> <b> 92 Paul Truswell MP</b><br><b> Labour, Pudsey</b> </p> <p> David's Law - my private member's bill - closed the loophole on selling alcohol to young people highlighted by the tragic death of 14-year-old David Knowles in my constituency. It also outlawed the practice of adults buying alcohol and handing it to youngsters outside. </p> <p><b>93 Prof Steve Webb MP</b><br><b>Liberal Democrat, Northavon</b></p> <p>My proudest moment was when Alistair Darling stood up before Christmas and said the government was not going to cut pensions for millions of widows at a cost of billions of pounds. That was the culmination of a campaign involving myself, colleagues and pensioner groups.</p> <p><b> 94 Sir Raymond Whitney MP</b><br><b>Conservative, Wycombe</b></p> <p>I am proud of helping to keep alive a constructive policy towards the EU in the Conservative party; trying to make people think clearly about healthcare; and my file of thank-you letters from constituents.</p> <p><b>95 Dafydd Wigley MP</b><br><b>Plaid Cymru, Caernarfon</b></p> <p>The landmark event in this parliament was the establishment of the National Assembly for Wales.

      "bodyText": "56 Tess Kingham MP Labour, Gloucester I led a campaign involving Gloucester people, local media and health workers to get a new hospital for the city. We will have a new A&amp;E department, children's centre and maternity services - proving that if politicians and local people lobby together, you get results. 57 Andrew Lansley MP Shadow cabinet office minister Conservative, South Cambridgeshire During debates on the protection of children bill, I pressed the government to exempt voluntary organisations from charges. I continued to argue with ministers, and persuaded my Conservative colleagues and William Hague to support this exemption. On the day William said we would exempt volunteers from charges, the government itself, contrary to its previous arguments, agreed to the exemption. 58 Edward Leigh MP Conservative, Gainsborough The defence of freedom has been my main goal. Freedom of religion for persecuted Christians across the world with three adjournment debates, freedom for religious institutions to employ believers, freedom for people to continue minority pursuits. The Guardian sketchwriter has acknowledged my continual questioning of ministers and I have worked for the protection of human life in opposing embryonic cloning. 59 William Hague MP Leader of the Opposition Conservative, Richmond With the help of my parliamentary colleagues and many others, we have rebuilt the Conservative party, reformed its organisation, reconnected with the mainstream majority of the country and put ourselves in a position where we can definitely win the next election. 60 Peter Lilley MP Conservative, Hitchin and Harpenden Forcing the government to change its policy on building on green fields, which I hope will disrupt plans, previously steamrollered through by local Labour and Lib Dem councillors and endorsed by Prescott, to build 10,000 homes on the green belt in my constituency. 61 Martin Linton MP Labour, Battersea I've contributed to 15 reports of the home affairs committee, edited a book of ideas for a second term, won amendments to the Political Parties Act, helped secure the future of New Covent Garden Market, affordable housing in riverside developments, and progress towards a London Orbital railway. Not earth-shaking, but far more than I achieved as a Guardian reporter. 62 Fiona Mactaggart MP Labour, Slough I secured a clause in the Immigration and Asylum Act retaining the right of appeal against deportation for people who have lived here for more than seven years. I have persuaded Berkshire Health Authority to do more to tackle the poor health of Slough. 63 Ken Maginnis MP Ulster Unionist, Fermanagh and South Tyrone The 1998 Belfast Agreement, even with its inevitable flaws. No more articles 2 and 3; international recognition of our place in the UK; a devolved legislature; political murders dropping from a 26-yearly average of 110 to single figures. It's a start. 64 Humfrey Malins MP Conservative, Woking Battling for a civilian Gulf war veteran, terribly ill after exposure to depleted uranium shells and always positive in outlook. I persuaded the defence minister to take a personal interest and even raised the matter with the prime minister at Question Time and got a personal response from him about the case. 65 Christine McCafferty MP Labour, Calder Valley Successful campaigns to reduce VAT on sanitary products, which were previously tax-rated as luxury items; for an open public inquiry on Harold Shipman that would include my constituents in Todmorden; and for inclusion of bio-diversity action plans in the countryside and rights of way bill. 66 Siobhain McDonagh MP Labour, Mitcham and Morden London Electricity threatened a local charitable trust, which houses elderly people, with a bill for \u00a360,000 for the installation of central heating. After I had managed to get an adjournment debate and the London Evening Standard had picked up the story, London Electricity backed down and installed the heating for free. 67 Kevin McNamara MP Labour, Hull North I put the final nail in the coffin of capital punishment by moving the amendment to include protocol 6 (which prohibits the death penalty) to the human rights bill. To reintroduce capital punishment Britain would have to resile from the whole Convention, as it gives no opportunity for a signatory state to derogate from protocol 6. 68 Michael Meacher MP Environment minister Labour, Oldham West and Royton The Countryside Act 2000; raising the profile of the environment throughout the country; international campaigning for action to combat global warming; a commitment to abolish fuel poverty by 2010; and setting a statutory target to triple recycling nationwide within five years. 69 Andrew Miller MP Labour Ellesmere Port and Neston Winning a six-year battle to get a constituent's relative out of a UN refugee camp on the Thai/Burmese border. A drop in the ocean compared to the suffering in Burma, but I will never forget the family's tears of joy as she landed in the UK. 70 Ray Michie MP Liberal Democrat, Argyll and Bute I campaigned for many years, as my father, Lord Bannerman of Kildonan, did before me, for the re-establishment of the Scottish Parliament. My greatest moment of satisfaction was the passing of the Scotland Act 1998. Clause 1 says it all: \"There shall be a Scottish Parliament.\" 71 Dan Norris MP Labour, Wansdyke My proudest achievement has been bringing national charities, the Home Office, local government and Wansdyke businesses together to protect children. Copies of Protecting Our Children - a booklet which advises parents on how they can effectively prevent their children being sexually abused - have been distributed to every family with children in Somerset and the former Avon. All free of charge. 72 Lembit \u00d6pik MP Liberal Democrat, Montgomeryshire I know I do big campaigns like asteroid threats, fox hunting and all that. But really, it's about individuals: like hip operations, CSA issues, housing crises, farming problems. Not UK front-page news, or Newsnight stuff. But it touches real people. If folk feel I've made their life better in a way they can point to, I'd be very proud. 73 Diana Organ MP Labour Forest of Dean I have set up a hysterectomies group to empower women and bring the issue of unnecessary hysterectomies to public attention. Lobbied for the development of a landscape of national importance for the Forest of Dean. Gained a commitment from the prime minister to sort out the long campaign on Freeminers' rights. 74 Richard Ottaway MP Conservative, Croydon South I stopped the development of the Medium Secure Unit for the mentally impaired next to three primary schools in Coulsdon, to the relief of parents in Croydon. On behalf of pensioners nationwide I brought the government to account over its handling of Equitable Life. And I finally cracked Mrs Johnson's social security claim. 75 Gordon Prentice MP Labour, Pendle I put forward my right to roam bill in an effort to encourage the government to open up the countryside. I was happy to withdraw it when the government decided at long last to bring in its own bill. 76 John Redwood MP Conservative, Wokingham I am proud to have been part of the opposition getting people to understand that this government is all spin and no substance.

In the end, Trevor MacDonald's Tonight programme ran a show on it, and I asked a question at PMQs that embarrassed Blair, and now they've stopped using the figures. 85 Dr Phyllis Starkey MP Labour, Milton Keynes South West Milton Keynes is a young city. I highlighted the risk to young people's safety from unregulated bouncers at pubs and clubs with my private member's bill calling for a national registration scheme for bouncers. This is now part of government legislation. 86 Ian Stewart MP Labour, Eccles I have campaigned with other MPs and families to secure a fair deal from government for victims of vaccine damage. Success was achieved when the government increased the payment to \u00a3100,000 equivalent for each damaged child, backdated for children already compensated at lower levels. 87 Gavin Strang MP Labour Edinburgh East and Musselburgh As transport minister I introduced the rural bus subsidy scheme, providing 1,800 new bus services and 16m passenger journeys last year. As chair of the Craigmillar social inclusion partnership board, I am involved in the regeneration of this deprived area in my constituency. 88 Gisela Stuart MP, junior health minister Labour, Birmingham Edgbaston The two things I am proudest of having achieved are serving on the social security select committee and helping to bring about legislation which allows for fairer divisions of pensions on divorce, and succeeding in getting legislation which makes kerbcrawling an arrestable offence. 89 John Swinney MP Leader, SNP Tayside North Contributing to the establishment of the first Scottish Parliament for 300 years. But on a more human level, MPs can genuinely make a difference to the lives of constituents: I still remember helping to secure \u00a318,000 compensation from the Child Support Agency for a mother who was desperately in need of the money. 90 Teddy Taylor MP Conservative, Rochford and Southend East As democracy has declined, the main achievements of MPs today are either as social workers or community interventionists.

Some have had direct impact on the lives of individual constituents; others have had a hand in the passage of legislation that will make life better for us all, which is no mean feat. Several mention their role in facilitating stem cell research - a free vote - or the passage of the minimum wage, New Labour's homage to the party's founders. Scottish, Irish and Welsh MPs express pride in their role in the creation of devolved government - which is diminishing the scope of Westminster for the sake of greater self-government in the United Kingdom's nations (except England).</p> <p>MPs are proud to have raised their voices to get their constituency a new clinic or investment or stop a factory closing. If the pork barrel contains a nursery or new road, should we begrudge an MP a sense of achievement - in all systems of representative politics, serving the home district entails winning goodies for it.</p> <p>And yet there is something missing from these accounts. They have a defensive, reticent quality, which may have to do with Westminster's existential dilemma. In a system dominated by party loyalty and executive prerogative, what are MPs for beyond their nocturnal strolls through the lobbies? Helping a mother with the child support agency or winning pensions for neglected ex- prisoners of war are creditable. But MPs are not social workers.</p> <p>Few MPs mention their sense of pride in belonging to a representative assembly, and that may be for the good reason there is not much pride about the Commons these days. The Keith Vaz affair has merely confirmed last year's lesson from the way the chairs of Commons' select committees were so easily fobbed off by the government. This, the legislative branch of the constitution, has fallen into decrepitude. It is not the only one.</p>",

      "bodyText": "They are almost convincing. Our MPs describe their accomplishments in G2 today and the list is many and varied. Some have had direct impact on the lives of individual constituents; others have had a hand in the passage of legislation that will make life better for us all, which is no mean feat. Several mention their role in facilitating stem cell research - a free vote - or the passage of the minimum wage, New Labour's homage to the party's founders. Scottish, Irish and Welsh MPs express pride in their role in the creation of devolved government - which is diminishing the scope of Westminster for the sake of greater self-government in the United Kingdom's nations (except England). MPs are proud to have raised their voices to get their constituency a new clinic or investment or stop a factory closing. If the pork barrel contains a nursery or new road, should we begrudge an MP a sense of achievement - in all systems of representative politics, serving the home district entails winning goodies for it. And yet there is something missing from these accounts. They have a defensive, reticent quality, which may have to do with Westminster's existential dilemma. In a system dominated by party loyalty and executive prerogative, what are MPs for beyond their nocturnal strolls through the lobbies? Helping a mother with the child support agency or winning pensions for neglected ex- prisoners of war are creditable. But MPs are not social workers. Few MPs mention their sense of pride in belonging to a representative assembly, and that may be for the good reason there is not much pride about the Commons these days. The Keith Vaz affair has merely confirmed last year's lesson from the way the chairs of Commons' select committees were so easily fobbed off by the government. This, the legislative branch of the constitution, has fallen into decrepitude. It is not the only one.",

      "body": "<p>Our Members of Parliament are largely a mystery to us. We know the names of the cabinet and a handful of the opposition front bench, a few eccentrics perhaps, and some notable old timers, but a lot of us are pushed to name our own member. MPs appear before us in a fleeting parade on election night, standing beside the returning officers, flushed and exuberant, only to vanish as they are absorbed into the drama of the night.</p> <p>Many of those people on election night are being elected for the first time and you notice the extraordinary pride and hope. Yet they probably don't appreciate the life of unsung drudgery which lies ahead, nor that the vast majority of the 659 members simply disappear while trying to wrestle with the system of government and democracy wired up around them. To come to grips with this machine, to bid for the attention of your constituents and to attract the eye of the party managers, at the same time as holding true to the beliefs that have propelled you, requires considerable gifts of management and tenacity.</p> <p>The life of a legislator is increasingly lived in an odd obscurity. The opportunities for making your mark in the chamber are almost non-existent and the occasions which might prompt passionate oratory are few and ill-attended. Government has removed itself from the palace. Today, everything is focused on Tony Blair and Gordon Brown in Downing Street, together with the numerous unelected officials who have palpably more power than most of those who have stood for election.</p> <p>Modern legislators have been bested by the requirements of slick management and centralised presentation. An ambition to rise to the top can only be pursued in a manner which suggests conformity and accommodation. Hopes are buried and egos trampled, while outside Westminster the public remains suspicious that the \u00a348,371 paid to each MP, plus \u00a364,000 in secretarial and living allowances, is a waste of money. It is further argued that with the Scottish and Welsh assemblies, the pre-eminence of Europe and the concentration of power in Downing Street, that at least 100 members are surplus to requirements.</p> <p>What we forget in all this is the difference between the role of a legislator and that of a representative. We use the terms interchangeably because they refer to the same people but there is a subtle distinction which is brought out in the responses to our survey. Forty-one MPs quoted their role in the drafting and passing of legislation and some, like Robin Cook, surveyed a panorama of almost global personal success.</p> <p>But the great majority cited small local victories, the resurfacing of roads, the gaining of a passport denied by the immigration authorities, the opening of a school library, the tour of a Down's syndrome theatre group (Gerry Adams) and the solving of a housing problems which had driven a young man to threaten suicide (Teddy Taylor). Twenty-two MPs claimed the achievement of saving a hospital, opening a new one or gaining some other health improvement, while 10 talked about educational investments.</p> <p>We may be cynical about these responses, given that the election is only nine weeks away and MPs need to remind constituents of their usefulness. However, it is true to say that as representatives they mostly display a doggedness and care which goes largely unremarked. Reading the answers 232 of them provided, a lot of people may change their mind on two issues.</p> <p>The first is the size of the House of Commons. The respected backbencher Teddy Taylor says, \"As democracy has declined, the main achievements of MPs are either as social workers or as community interventionists\". He may be depressingly right about democracy - many on the Labour benches agree with him - but it doesn't follow that we should reduce the number of people who have access to ministers and the motivation to work in the way that he describes.</p> <p>The second is the question of proportional representation, which is claimed to be a fairer way of distilling the nation's political sentiments into parliament. The problem with PR is that a member's direct responsibility for his constituents is lost in the proportional cocktail. Instead of one person charged with acting as social worker, administrative detective, court of last resort and so forth, there can be two or three, and it becomes unclear who has this crucial responsibility. An MP's relationship with her or his constituents is an essential part of democracy and these responses show it.</p> <p>There are certain universals in a MP's life which means it is often difficult to tell from their replies which party they represent. MPs spend a good deal of time representing their constituents against the insensitive, inefficient and unjust arms of government, so the victories they write about are often non-political. Oddly enough the same applies to their work in committees, a part of the MP's life which goes completely ignored because so little of it receives detailed coverage. It is difficult to read Gisella Stuart's affiliation when she writes, \"The two things I am proudest about are serving on the social security select committee and helping to bring about legislation which allows for fairer divisions of pensions on divorce ... and succeeding in getting legislation which makes kerb crawling an offence.\" Stuart is a junior health minister, but the contributions that give her satisfaction are interestingly bipartisan.</p> <p>The same is true of members who have campaigned against violent club bouncers (Dr Phyllis Starkey, Lab); for the opening of a second hand furniture store (Caroline Spelman, Con); against the opening of a McDonald's (Ian Taylor, Con) and against the loophole which allowed alcohol to be sold to 14-year-olds (Paul Truswell, Lab). They could swap issues without compromising their political persuasions.</p> <p>The responses also provide a very clear cutaway of the mainstream of opinion and concerns in Britain in 2001. It is predictable that hospitals and schools and regeneration projects feature so prominently, though it is odd that no MP has much to say about law and order.</p> <p>If a similar survey had been conducted among members of the German, French or Dutch legislatures we would see less focus on health and education because their systems are better, and more on the environment, which among voters on the continent of 35 and under is considered the most pressing issue of all. Here there are relatively few MPs who rate this worth a mention. Only Alan Whitehead (Lab) appears to have absorbed the message about renewable energy sources. He may be regarded as being in the vanguard of one of the 21st century's principle concerns.</p> <p>One cannot help smile at some of the replies which have a distinctly Pooterish quality. In a few MPs the sense of self worth seems quite out of proportion. When David Atkinson (Con) claims responsibility for alerting the world to the threat of the millennium bug it's hard to take him seriously. George Galloway (Lab) remarks that he has stood firm against the new imperialism and Anglo-American aggression and that he has been \"a voice for the voiceless in the canyons of deprivation in the world\".</p> <p>When we started this project, we suspected the results would underline a sceptical view of the work of MPs. In fact it has done the opposite. What emerges from this sample of a third of all MPs is that notions of public service are hearteningly alive in the House of Commons. It would appear that they do a great deal of good which goes unnoticed. Over the next few days we will try to find out if their constituents agree. This is, after all, only one side of the story.</p> <p><b> 1 Gerry Adams MP</b><br><b>Sinn Fein leader</b><br><b>Sinn Fein, Belfast West</b></p> <p>Getting the peace process back on track and being part of achieving the Good Friday Agreement. Following some conversations I had in New York last year, this St Patrick's Day saw 14 Down's syndrome adults, who make up the Sky's the Limit theatre group, travelling there to perform for US audiences.</p> <p><b> 2 David Amess</b><br> <b>MP Conservative, Southend West</b></p> <p>My proudest achievement was to pilot successfully through parliament the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Act. This should improve the lives of up to 5m people, taking them out of fuel poverty by ensuring their homes are properly insulated.</p> <p><b> 3 James Arbuthnot MP</b><br><b> Opposition chief whip </b><br><b>Conservative, North East Hampshire</b></p> <p>My achievement was shared with others of the Mull of Kintyre group. When Lord Chalfont won a select committee to consider the 1994 Chinook crash, he set us all on the first step towards redressing a gross injustice to the dead pilots.</p> <p><b> 4 Joseph Ashton MP </b><br><b>Labour, Bassetlaw</b></p> <p>The Utting report exposed a horrifying catalogue of sexual abuse to children in care. The Ashton amendment I introduced fixed the age of consent at 18, not 16, in any situation where an adult was in charge of them.</p> <p><b> 5 Harry Barnes MP</b><br><b> Labour, North East Derbyshire</b></p> <p>Major aspects of my two private member's bills have been turned by Labour into improved rights for disabled people and a more modern system of electoral registration. I hope I succeed, with War on Want, in winning greater support for a \"Tobin Tax\" on international currency exchanges. This would deter quick-buck speculators and raise billions for third-world development.</p> <p><b> 6 Kevin Barron MP</b><br><b> Labour, Rother Valley</b></p> <p>In 1993-4 I promoted a private member's bill to ban the advertising and promotion of tobacco products, which was \"talked out\" by the Tories. My proudest parliamentary moment for this session, therefore, was to be involved in the passage of a government bill to ban tobacco advertising and promotion.</p> <p><b> 7 Hugh Bayley MP</b><br><b> Junior social security minister</b><br><b>Labour, City of York</b></p> <p>In November I cleared my London diary and joined York's flood defence team. When we ran out of sandbags I appealed for sack workers to sew more overnight. By dawn they had delivered four-and-a-half tons of bags to fill. Thousands of York homes and businesses were saved by the sandbag walls.</p> <p><b> 8 Martin Bell MP</b><br><b> Independent, Tatton</b></p> <p>My proudest moment in this Parliament has had little to do with any of my own speeches. It came on November 8 2000, when the government announced compensation payments of \u00a310,000 each for the surviving Far East prisoners of war and their widows in a long-overdue recognition of their service and sacrifice.</p> <p><b>9 Clive Betts MP</b><br><b>Government whip</b><br><b>Labour, Sheffield Attercliffe</b></p> <p>It would have to be whipping the bill that established the minimum wage and organising the 24-hour sitting that eventually broke the Tory filibustering and got the legislation through.</p> <p><b> 10 Richard Burden MP </b><br><b>Labour, Birmingham Northfield</b></p> <p>As the local Labour MP, I am proud to have played a part in saving the Longbridge car plant from closure. More than 20,000 jobs were at stake. The experts said Rover could not be saved. The community came together and we proved them wrong. Under new ownership, MG Rover is now doing well.</p> <p><b> 11 Simon Burns MP</b><br><b> Conservative, Chelmsford West</b></p> <p>Successfully piloting through Parliament my private member's bill - the Football (Offences and Disorder) Act 1999 to tighten up the law on football hooligans, and pressuring the government to strengthen legislation further in 2000 by giving the courts the power to withdraw hooligans' passports and prevent them from causing trouble abroad.</p> <p><b> 12 Dr Vincent Cable MP</b><br><b> Lib Dem, Twickenham</b></p> <p>Two years ago, working with Age Concern, I introduced a bill to outlaw age discrimination in the NHS after some elderly constituents had suffered serious neglect in hospital. Last week the government introduced new standards which meet the aims of my bill.</p> <p><b> 13 Dale Campbell-Savours MP</b><br><b> Labour, Workington</b></p> <p>I have long argued for a system for the tracking of animals modelled on that operating in Holland. Finally, in 1997, after I'd made representations to Jeff Rooker, the agriculture minister, a centre was built in Workington. Now 618 people work there and trace all animals in the UK. It is vital to the current foot and mouth battle.</p> <p><b> 14 William Cash MP </b><br><b>Conservative, Stone</b></p> <p>Successfully maintaining pressure within the country and the Conservative party for a policy of renegotiation of the European treaties; persuading the party to demand a white paper on political union; and being elected as chairman of the 200-strong all-party committee on third-world debt.</p> <p><b> 15 Christopher Chope MP</b><br><b> Conservative, Christchurch</b></p> <p>My most satisfying success was to force the government to give a British passport to Sujata Halder, a volunteer worker at the Christchurch Citizens Advice Bureau. The minister was adamant in his refusal until I secured an adjournment debate whereupon he changed his mind before the debate - doubtless to avoid ridicule.</p> <p><b> 16 Dr David Clark MP </b><br><b>Labour, South Shields</b></p> <p>The achievement that gives me the greatest satisfaction was writing the freedom of information white paper, Your Right to Know. This provided the basis for legislation which over time will enhance the rights of individuals and change fundamentally the way governments relate to their citizens.</p> <p><b> 17 Ann Clwyd MP</b><br><b> Labour, Cynon Valley</b></p> <p>Some of the campaigns I have been particularly active in pursuing: speeding up the miners' compensation scheme; regulating cosmetic surgery; opposing the Ilusu dam scheme in Turkey; bringing Iraqi war criminals to justice.</p> <p><b> 18 Tim Collins MP</b><br><b>Conservative, Westmorland and Lonsdale</b></p> <p>The suffering of Gussie Spence of Kendal sparked my campaign on adhesive arachnoiditis - excruciating pain endured after injecting Myodil into the spine. A Commons debate, ministerial meetings and work on an all-party group are all bringing a public inquiry nearer.</p> <p><b> 19 Tony Colman MP </b><br><b>Labour, Putney</b></p> <p>Too many people in south-west London suffer sleep deprivation as a result of aircraft noise at night. I am delighted that, in contrast to my predecessor, I have managed to do something about that: the number of night flights arriving at Heathrow over Putney has been halved.</p> <p><b> 20 Francis Cook MP</b><br><b> Labour, Stockton North</b></p> <p>As vice-president of the Nato parliamentary assembly, I managed to re-establish an effective working relationship between the Russian Duma and Nato parliamentarians in the form of the joint monitoring group of the permanent joint council.</p> <p><b> 21 Jeremy Corbyn MP</b><br><b> Labour, Islington North</b></p> <p>The detention of General Pinochet for 503 days in Britain helped to change the political climate in Chile, which means there is now a real prospect of him being put on trial. I am delighted that the government has put so much money into housing repairs, but in a second term it must put money into new council housing in London.</p> <p><b> 22 Ann Cryer MP</b><br><b> Labour, Keighley</b></p> <p>I'm most proud of my adjournment debate on forced marriages of British-Asian women in 1999. Since then the government has acted, setting itself an action plan which offers help to women who were without it before.</p> <p><b> 23 John Cummings MP </b><br><b>Labour, Easington</b></p> <p>I've been instrumental in the adoption of the new multiple index of deprivation, which looks at access to services and health as well as income. Easington's new classification under these criteria has led to greater funds being available for the borough. I've also lobbied the government to accept compensation claims from former miners who have developed bronchitis or emphysema.</p> <p><b> 24 Jack Cunningham MP</b><br><b> Labour, Copeland</b></p> <p>Working for the complete restoration of the Georgian port of Whitehaven; winning the case for the A595 improvement; supporting policies to reduce unemployment dramatically in Copeland. Leading the campaign to safeguard the future of Sellafield and the 16,000 jobs it sustains. In government, the creation of the FSA and launching the \"modern government\" initiative.</p> <p><b> 25 James Cunningham MP</b><br><b> Labour, Coventry South</b></p> <p>My area I'm proudest of in this parliament is raising an airport safety private member's bill. Coventry airport had a plane crash in 1995 and I was concerned about the welfare and safety of my constituents living so near to the airfield.</p> <p><b> 26 Tam Dalyell MP </b><br><b>Labour, Linlithgow</b></p> <p>The fact that the Lockerbie trial took place at Zeist, in an independent country; visiting Iraq with the Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, thus restraining a little the bombing of Baghdad; opposing Blair's Balkan war, going separately to Belgrade and Kosovo; opposing the privatisation of air traffic control.</p> <p><b> 27 Jim Dobbin MP</b><br><b>Labour, Heywood and Middleton</b></p> <p>I was instrumental in forcing a firm of cowboy builders operating in the Greater Manchester area to go into liquidation. My recent question to the prime minister allowed him to announce the creation for the first time of a minister for ex-servicemen and women.</p> <p><b>28 David Atkinson MP<b><br></b>Conservative, Bournemouth East</b></p> <p>My greatest achievement has been my contribution to saving this country and the wider industrial world from the threat of the millennium bug, through my initiative in the House of Commons, where I was the first MP to raise the issue, the Council of Europe, Western European Union and my visits to the US and Japan.</p> <p><b> 29 Alan Duncan MP</b><br><b> Conservative, Rutland and Melton</b></p> <p>I played a major part in securing William Hague's election as party leader. I helped shift the public debate on Britain's healthcare while a frontbench spokesman, and have been able to help desperate farmers wrestling with foot and mouth disease locally.</p> <p><b> 30 Margaret Ewing MP </b><br><b>SNP, Moray</b></p> <p>I was proud to be involved in the campaign for a maternity unit for Moray. Not only did we get a maternity unit, we also succeeded in getting a new hospital in the shape of Dr Gray's in Elgin.</p> <p><b> 31 Howard Flight MP</b><br><b>Conservative, Arundel and South Downs</b></p> <p>I did all the opposition donkey work for the financial services and markets bill, effecting major improvements to it, in particular the establishment of an independent complaints office. In my constituency the most rewarding individual case involved securing legal help for a man infected with hepatitis C by the surgeon who operated on him.</p> <p><b> 32 Paul Flynn MP </b><br><b>Labour, Newport West</b></p> <p>Helping make endowment mortgages unsellable, drugs prohibition indefensible, bull-bars unfashionable and Newport's delights web-visible. Exposing Labour's suicidal \"block vote\" in Wales, letting pets travel, and amplifying the near-silent voices of those who are pensioners, low-waged, imprisoned or inartic ulate.</p> <p><b> 33 Don Foster MP </b><br><b>Principal spokesman for environment, Liberal Democrat, Bath</b></p> <p>Other than assisting numerous constituents, I've also beefed up the government's weak plans for freedom of information in local government; ensured that all homes for sale will in future require a home-energy efficiency audit; allowed school crossing patrols to be covered for help given to non-pupils; and helped ensure legislation against the scourge of leylandii.</p> <p><b> 34 George Foulkes MP</b><br><b> Scottish Office minister </b><br><b>Labour, Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley</b></p> <p>My proudest achievement is to have played a little part in the return of democracy to Chile; by monitoring the plebiscite, supporting the election of Patricio Aylwin and giving some help to the left, which saw the return of Ricardo Lagos as a socialist president to avenge the coup that ousted Salvador Allende.</p> <p><b> 35 Maria Fyfe MP </b><br><b>Labour, Glasgow Maryhill</b></p> <p>I am proudest of having been involved in the 50-50 campaign to ensure that the Scottish parliament started life with an almost equal representation of women, up there with the Scandinavian countries.</p> <p><b>36 Anne Begg MP </b><br><b>Labour, Aberdeen South</b></p> <p>I am most proud of the role I played in persuading the House of Commons to support the changes to the regulations on the use of embryonic stem cells in medical research. I believe that this has the potential to lead to the discovery and development of treatments and cures for some of the most horrific degenerative diseases.</p> <p><b> 37 George Galloway MP</b><br><b> Labour, Glasgow Kelvin</b></p> <p>I am proudest to have stood firmly against the new imperialism and Anglo-American aggression around the world. To have been a voice for the voiceless here in Britain, where so many have been marginalised in the fight for \"middle England\", and in the canyons of deprivation in the world.</p> <p><b> 38 Mike Gapes MP</b><br><b> Labour, Ilford South</b></p> <p>My proudest achievement was to be part of the British government's team negotiating the Good Friday Agreement when I was parliamentary private secretary to Paul Murphy. The most moving achievement was shaking hands with people with no hands at the \"amputee camp\" in Sierra Leone in February this year, which I visited as a member of the defence select committee.</p> <p><b> 39 Neil Gerrard MP </b><br><b>Labour, Walthamstow</b></p> <p>I was proud to be involved in persuading the government to produce the first national strategy for HIV; to stand up for rights of asylum seekers, particularly on the asylum and immigration bill; and to be a member of the commission of inquiry into the right of return of Palestinian refugees.</p> <p><b> 40 Christopher Gill MP</b><br><b>Conservative, Ludlow</b></p> <p>My battle for the retention of smaller abattoirs has resulted in major changes, to be implemented in April, in the way that meat inspection charges are levied. My efforts to highlight the iniquities of the common fisheries policy have resulted in a change of Conservative party policy, which now says that we will take back control of our fishing waters.</p> <p><b> 41 Cheryl Gillan MP </b><br><b> Conservative, Chesham and Amersham</b></p> <p>Being able to persuade social services that a care package could be worked out to enable an elderly constituent to stay at home and be nursed there, which was what the constituent wanted more than anything.</p> <p><b> 42 Linda Gilroy MP</b><br><b> Labour, Plymouth Sutton</b></p> <p>One in four Plymouth people missed out on school and have low basic skills. My constituent Sue Torr learned to read at the age of 38. By backing her \"Shout It Out\" literacy project in Westminster I hope I have helped her help more people to do the same.</p> <p><b> 43 Tommy Graham MP</b><br><b> Independent, Renfrewshire West</b></p> <p>The fight to retain jobs in the Royal Ordnance factory at Bishopstone is something I consider as a personal achievement. The need to secure an indigenous armaments industry is essential for the future of the national security of this country.</p> <p><b> 44 Jane Griffiths MP</b><br><b> Labour, Reading East</b></p> <p>I'm most proud of having raised the issue of men's health, in particular testicular and prostate cancer. I persuaded male councillors and members of Reading FC to pose in the street wearing only underpants; established the all-party group on male cancers; and asked parliamentary questions resulting in the availability of testing for prostate cancer for every man who requests it.</p> <p><b> 45 Peter Hain MP</b><br><b> trade and industry minister, Labour, Neath</b></p> <p>Playing a key campaigning role in winning the referendum for a Welsh Assembly and achieving a huge 30% swing from the crushing \"no\" vote in 1979.</p> <p><b> 46 Archibald Hamilton MP</b><br><b> Conservative, Epsom and Ewell</b></p> <p>I would much prefer to comment on what I have failed to achieve as an MP since 1997, which is to make the press and media in this country any more responsible. They continue to be answerable to no one other than their proprietors and are increasingly courted by politicians. This leaves a serious democratic deficit.</p> <p><b> 47 Harriet Harman MP Labour </b><br><b> Camberwell and Peckham</b></p> <p>Being part of the government that introduced the national childcare strategy and the new deal for lone parents. Then, as a backbencher, chairing Southwark's Childcare Partnership, which got 4,100 more after-school club places for local children; and supporting its new-deal personal advisers who helped make 28,000 children better off by helping their mothers move off benefits and into work.</p> <p><b> 48 Sir Alan Haselhurst MP </b><br><b>Conservative, Saffron Walden</b></p> <p>I took particular pleasure in helping a constituent of Polish extraction who had served as a nurse in the allied war effort. Having survived the torpedoing of a ship, she was entitled to a pension, but was unable to prove that she had been aboard. I extracted from the MoD records proof of her service, which led to her receiving her pension.</p> <p><b> 49 Andrew Hunter MP </b><br><b>Conservative, Basingstoke</b></p> <p>My private member's bill, which became the Road Traffic (Vehicle Testing) Act 1999; a government commitment to a quieter M3 surface through Basingstoke; to have been one of only a handful of mainland MPs who have consistently opposed the sell-out to terrorism in Northern Ireland.</p> <p><b> 50 Michael Jack MP </b><br><b> Conservative, Fylde</b></p> <p>My worthwhile achievements include helping hundreds of constituents with problems; my work on the agriculture select committee; helping to win business for aerospace and nuclear workers; and masterminding an event to raise \u00a33,000 for the local hospice.</p> <p><b> 51 Ieuan Wyn Jones MP </b><br><b>Leader, Plaid Cymru, Ynys Mn</b></p> <p>Despite its weaknesses, the Government of Wales Act 1998 represents a small but significant step forward for Wales. I'm glad to have taken part in the debate, both in Parliament and in helping to deliver a \"yes\" vote in the referendum.</p> <p><b> 52 Dr Lynne Jones MP </b><br><b>Labour, Birmingham Selly Oak</b></p> <p>Child benefit, disability benefits and the state pension are all better as a result of the backbench \"rebellions\" in which I played a leading role. Through the all-party mental health group, I have helped mental health organisations work more effectively together. My persistence on behalf of constituents has secured a more just outcome in a large number of individual cases.</p> <p><b> 53 Tessa Jowell MP, education and employment minister </b><br><b> Labour, Dulwich and West Norwood</b></p> <p>Delivering SureStart, the early-nurture programme for disadvantaged mums and their babies, because equality is a birthright. In my constituency, a new secondary school, a new community hospital promised, a police station kept open; and helping people such as Dr M, reunited with his daughter after eight years.</p> <p><b>54 Robin Cook MP Foreign secretary</b><br><b>Labour, Livingston</b></p> <p>Breaking the deadlock in the Lockerbie case; defending Kosovo; saving lives and relieving suffering in Sierra Leone; contributing to the fall of Milosevic; transforming Britain's relations with Europe; rebuilding respect for Britain in the world.</p> <p><b> 55 Fraser Kemp MP </b><br><b> Labour, Houghton and Washington East</b></p> <p>Following the tragic death of two young constituents from carbon monoxide poisoning, I presented my fuel safety bill to the Commons.

      "bodyText": "Our Members of Parliament are largely a mystery to us. We know the names of the cabinet and a handful of the opposition front bench, a few eccentrics perhaps, and some notable old timers, but a lot of us are pushed to name our own member. MPs appear before us in a fleeting parade on election night, standing beside the returning officers, flushed and exuberant, only to vanish as they are absorbed into the drama of the night. Many of those people on election night are being elected for the first time and you notice the extraordinary pride and hope. Yet they probably don't appreciate the life of unsung drudgery which lies ahead, nor that the vast majority of the 659 members simply disappear while trying to wrestle with the system of government and democracy wired up around them. To come to grips with this machine, to bid for the attention of your constituents and to attract the eye of the party managers, at the same time as holding true to the beliefs that have propelled you, requires considerable gifts of management and tenacity. The life of a legislator is increasingly lived in an odd obscurity. The opportunities for making your mark in the chamber are almost non-existent and the occasions which might prompt passionate oratory are few and ill-attended. Government has removed itself from the palace. Today, everything is focused on Tony Blair and Gordon Brown in Downing Street, together with the numerous unelected officials who have palpably more power than most of those who have stood for election. Modern legislators have been bested by the requirements of slick management and centralised presentation. An ambition to rise to the top can only be pursued in a manner which suggests conformity and accommodation. Hopes are buried and egos trampled, while outside Westminster the public remains suspicious that the \u00a348,371 paid to each MP, plus \u00a364,000 in secretarial and living allowances, is a waste of money. It is further argued that with the Scottish and Welsh assemblies, the pre-eminence of Europe and the concentration of power in Downing Street, that at least 100 members are surplus to requirements. What we forget in all this is the difference between the role of a legislator and that of a representative. We use the terms interchangeably because they refer to the same people but there is a subtle distinction which is brought out in the responses to our survey. Forty-one MPs quoted their role in the drafting and passing of legislation and some, like Robin Cook, surveyed a panorama of almost global personal success. But the great majority cited small local victories, the resurfacing of roads, the gaining of a passport denied by the immigration authorities, the opening of a school library, the tour of a Down's syndrome theatre group (Gerry Adams) and the solving of a housing problems which had driven a young man to threaten suicide (Teddy Taylor). Twenty-two MPs claimed the achievement of saving a hospital, opening a new one or gaining some other health improvement, while 10 talked about educational investments. We may be cynical about these responses, given that the election is only nine weeks away and MPs need to remind constituents of their usefulness. However, it is true to say that as representatives they mostly display a doggedness and care which goes largely unremarked. Reading the answers 232 of them provided, a lot of people may change their mind on two issues. The first is the size of the House of Commons. The respected backbencher Teddy Taylor says, \"As democracy has declined, the main achievements of MPs are either as social workers or as community interventionists\". He may be depressingly right about democracy - many on the Labour benches agree with him - but it doesn't follow that we should reduce the number of people who have access to ministers and the motivation to work in the way that he describes. The second is the question of proportional representation, which is claimed to be a fairer way of distilling the nation's political sentiments into parliament. The problem with PR is that a member's direct responsibility for his constituents is lost in the proportional cocktail. Instead of one person charged with acting as social worker, administrative detective, court of last resort and so forth, there can be two or three, and it becomes unclear who has this crucial responsibility. An MP's relationship with her or his constituents is an essential part of democracy and these responses show it. There are certain universals in a MP's life which means it is often difficult to tell from their replies which party they represent. MPs spend a good deal of time representing their constituents against the insensitive, inefficient and unjust arms of government, so the victories they write about are often non-political. Oddly enough the same applies to their work in committees, a part of the MP's life which goes completely ignored because so little of it receives detailed coverage. It is difficult to read Gisella Stuart's affiliation when she writes, \"The two things I am proudest about are serving on the social security select committee and helping to bring about legislation which allows for fairer divisions of pensions on divorce ... and succeeding in getting legislation which makes kerb crawling an offence.\" Stuart is a junior health minister, but the contributions that give her satisfaction are interestingly bipartisan. The same is true of members who have campaigned against violent club bouncers (Dr Phyllis Starkey, Lab); for the opening of a second hand furniture store (Caroline Spelman, Con); against the opening of a McDonald's (Ian Taylor, Con) and against the loophole which allowed alcohol to be sold to 14-year-olds (Paul Truswell, Lab). They could swap issues without compromising their political persuasions. The responses also provide a very clear cutaway of the mainstream of opinion and concerns in Britain in 2001. It is predictable that hospitals and schools and regeneration projects feature so prominently, though it is odd that no MP has much to say about law and order. If a similar survey had been conducted among members of the German, French or Dutch legislatures we would see less focus on health and education because their systems are better, and more on the environment, which among voters on the continent of 35 and under is considered the most pressing issue of all. Here there are relatively few MPs who rate this worth a mention. Only Alan Whitehead (Lab) appears to have absorbed the message about renewable energy sources. He may be regarded as being in the vanguard of one of the 21st century's principle concerns. One cannot help smile at some of the replies which have a distinctly Pooterish quality. In a few MPs the sense of self worth seems quite out of proportion. When David Atkinson (Con) claims responsibility for alerting the world to the threat of the millennium bug it's hard to take him seriously. George Galloway (Lab) remarks that he has stood firm against the new imperialism and Anglo-American aggression and that he has been \"a voice for the voiceless in the canyons of deprivation in the world\". When we started this project, we suspected the results would underline a sceptical view of the work of MPs. In fact it has done the opposite. What emerges from this sample of a third of all MPs is that notions of public service are hearteningly alive in the House of Commons. It would appear that they do a great deal of good which goes unnoticed. Over the next few days we will try to find out if their constituents agree. This is, after all, only one side of the story. 1 Gerry Adams MP Sinn Fein leader Sinn Fein, Belfast West Getting the peace process back on track and being part of achieving the Good Friday Agreement. Following some conversations I had in New York last year, this St Patrick's Day saw 14 Down's syndrome adults, who make up the Sky's the Limit theatre group, travelling there to perform for US audiences. 2 David Amess MP Conservative, Southend West My proudest achievement was to pilot successfully through parliament the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Act. This should improve the lives of up to 5m people, taking them out of fuel poverty by ensuring their homes are properly insulated. 3 James Arbuthnot MP Opposition chief whip Conservative, North East Hampshire My achievement was shared with others of the Mull of Kintyre group. When Lord Chalfont won a select committee to consider the 1994 Chinook crash, he set us all on the first step towards redressing a gross injustice to the dead pilots. 4 Joseph Ashton MP Labour, Bassetlaw The Utting report exposed a horrifying catalogue of sexual abuse to children in care. The Ashton amendment I introduced fixed the age of consent at 18, not 16, in any situation where an adult was in charge of them. 5 Harry Barnes MP Labour, North East Derbyshire Major aspects of my two private member's bills have been turned by Labour into improved rights for disabled people and a more modern system of electoral registration. I hope I succeed, with War on Want, in winning greater support for a \"Tobin Tax\" on international currency exchanges. This would deter quick-buck speculators and raise billions for third-world development. 6 Kevin Barron MP Labour, Rother Valley In 1993-4 I promoted a private member's bill to ban the advertising and promotion of tobacco products, which was \"talked out\" by the Tories. My proudest parliamentary moment for this session, therefore, was to be involved in the passage of a government bill to ban tobacco advertising and promotion. 7 Hugh Bayley MP Junior social security minister Labour, City of York In November I cleared my London diary and joined York's flood defence team. When we ran out of sandbags I appealed for sack workers to sew more overnight. By dawn they had delivered four-and-a-half tons of bags to fill. Thousands of York homes and businesses were saved by the sandbag walls. 8 Martin Bell MP Independent, Tatton My proudest moment in this Parliament has had little to do with any of my own speeches. It came on November 8 2000, when the government announced compensation payments of \u00a310,000 each for the surviving Far East prisoners of war and their widows in a long-overdue recognition of their service and sacrifice. 9 Clive Betts MP Government whip Labour, Sheffield Attercliffe It would have to be whipping the bill that established the minimum wage and organising the 24-hour sitting that eventually broke the Tory filibustering and got the legislation through. 10 Richard Burden MP Labour, Birmingham Northfield As the local Labour MP, I am proud to have played a part in saving the Longbridge car plant from closure. More than 20,000 jobs were at stake. The experts said Rover could not be saved. The community came together and we proved them wrong. Under new ownership, MG Rover is now doing well. 11 Simon Burns MP Conservative, Chelmsford West Successfully piloting through Parliament my private member's bill - the Football (Offences and Disorder) Act 1999 to tighten up the law on football hooligans, and pressuring the government to strengthen legislation further in 2000 by giving the courts the power to withdraw hooligans' passports and prevent them from causing trouble abroad. 12 Dr Vincent Cable MP Lib Dem, Twickenham Two years ago, working with Age Concern, I introduced a bill to outlaw age discrimination in the NHS after some elderly constituents had suffered serious neglect in hospital. Last week the government introduced new standards which meet the aims of my bill. 13 Dale Campbell-Savours MP Labour, Workington I have long argued for a system for the tracking of animals modelled on that operating in Holland. Finally, in 1997, after I'd made representations to Jeff Rooker, the agriculture minister, a centre was built in Workington. Now 618 people work there and trace all animals in the UK. It is vital to the current foot and mouth battle. 14 William Cash MP Conservative, Stone Successfully maintaining pressure within the country and the Conservative party for a policy of renegotiation of the European treaties; persuading the party to demand a white paper on political union; and being elected as chairman of the 200-strong all-party committee on third-world debt. 15 Christopher Chope MP Conservative, Christchurch My most satisfying success was to force the government to give a British passport to Sujata Halder, a volunteer worker at the Christchurch Citizens Advice Bureau. The minister was adamant in his refusal until I secured an adjournment debate whereupon he changed his mind before the debate - doubtless to avoid ridicule. 16 Dr David Clark MP Labour, South Shields The achievement that gives me the greatest satisfaction was writing the freedom of information white paper, Your Right to Know. This provided the basis for legislation which over time will enhance the rights of individuals and change fundamentally the way governments relate to their citizens. 17 Ann Clwyd MP Labour, Cynon Valley Some of the campaigns I have been particularly active in pursuing: speeding up the miners' compensation scheme; regulating cosmetic surgery; opposing the Ilusu dam scheme in Turkey; bringing Iraqi war criminals to justice. 18 Tim Collins MP Conservative, Westmorland and Lonsdale The suffering of Gussie Spence of Kendal sparked my campaign on adhesive arachnoiditis - excruciating pain endured after injecting Myodil into the spine. A Commons debate, ministerial meetings and work on an all-party group are all bringing a public inquiry nearer. 19 Tony Colman MP Labour, Putney Too many people in south-west London suffer sleep deprivation as a result of aircraft noise at night. I am delighted that, in contrast to my predecessor, I have managed to do something about that: the number of night flights arriving at Heathrow over Putney has been halved. 20 Francis Cook MP Labour, Stockton North As vice-president of the Nato parliamentary assembly, I managed to re-establish an effective working relationship between the Russian Duma and Nato parliamentarians in the form of the joint monitoring group of the permanent joint council. 21 Jeremy Corbyn MP Labour, Islington North The detention of General Pinochet for 503 days in Britain helped to change the political climate in Chile, which means there is now a real prospect of him being put on trial. I am delighted that the government has put so much money into housing repairs, but in a second term it must put money into new council housing in London. 22 Ann Cryer MP Labour, Keighley I'm most proud of my adjournment debate on forced marriages of British-Asian women in 1999. Since then the government has acted, setting itself an action plan which offers help to women who were without it before. 23 John Cummings MP Labour, Easington I've been instrumental in the adoption of the new multiple index of deprivation, which looks at access to services and health as well as income. Easington's new classification under these criteria has led to greater funds being available for the borough. I've also lobbied the government to accept compensation claims from former miners who have developed bronchitis or emphysema. 24 Jack Cunningham MP Labour, Copeland Working for the complete restoration of the Georgian port of Whitehaven; winning the case for the A595 improvement; supporting policies to reduce unemployment dramatically in Copeland. Leading the campaign to safeguard the future of Sellafield and the 16,000 jobs it sustains. In government, the creation of the FSA and launching the \"modern government\" initiative. 25 James Cunningham MP Labour, Coventry South My area I'm proudest of in this parliament is raising an airport safety private member's bill. Coventry airport had a plane crash in 1995 and I was concerned about the welfare and safety of my constituents living so near to the airfield. 26 Tam Dalyell MP Labour, Linlithgow The fact that the Lockerbie trial took place at Zeist, in an independent country; visiting Iraq with the Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, thus restraining a little the bombing of Baghdad; opposing Blair's Balkan war, going separately to Belgrade and Kosovo; opposing the privatisation of air traffic control. 27 Jim Dobbin MP Labour, Heywood and Middleton I was instrumental in forcing a firm of cowboy builders operating in the Greater Manchester area to go into liquidation. My recent question to the prime minister allowed him to announce the creation for the first time of a minister for ex-servicemen and women. 28 David Atkinson MP Conservative, Bournemouth East My greatest achievement has been my contribution to saving this country and the wider industrial world from the threat of the millennium bug, through my initiative in the House of Commons, where I was the first MP to raise the issue, the Council of Europe, Western European Union and my visits to the US and Japan. 29 Alan Duncan MP Conservative, Rutland and Melton I played a major part in securing William Hague's election as party leader. I helped shift the public debate on Britain's healthcare while a frontbench spokesman, and have been able to help desperate farmers wrestling with foot and mouth disease locally. 30 Margaret Ewing MP SNP, Moray I was proud to be involved in the campaign for a maternity unit for Moray. Not only did we get a maternity unit, we also succeeded in getting a new hospital in the shape of Dr Gray's in Elgin. 31 Howard Flight MP Conservative, Arundel and South Downs I did all the opposition donkey work for the financial services and markets bill, effecting major improvements to it, in particular the establishment of an independent complaints office. In my constituency the most rewarding individual case involved securing legal help for a man infected with hepatitis C by the surgeon who operated on him. 32 Paul Flynn MP Labour, Newport West Helping make endowment mortgages unsellable, drugs prohibition indefensible, bull-bars unfashionable and Newport's delights web-visible. Exposing Labour's suicidal \"block vote\" in Wales, letting pets travel, and amplifying the near-silent voices of those who are pensioners, low-waged, imprisoned or inartic ulate. 33 Don Foster MP Principal spokesman for environment, Liberal Democrat, Bath Other than assisting numerous constituents, I've also beefed up the government's weak plans for freedom of information in local government; ensured that all homes for sale will in future require a home-energy efficiency audit; allowed school crossing patrols to be covered for help given to non-pupils; and helped ensure legislation against the scourge of leylandii. 34 George Foulkes MP Scottish Office minister Labour, Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley My proudest achievement is to have played a little part in the return of democracy to Chile; by monitoring the plebiscite, supporting the election of Patricio Aylwin and giving some help to the left, which saw the return of Ricardo Lagos as a socialist president to avenge the coup that ousted Salvador Allende. 35 Maria Fyfe MP Labour, Glasgow Maryhill I am proudest of having been involved in the 50-50 campaign to ensure that the Scottish parliament started life with an almost equal representation of women, up there with the Scandinavian countries. 36 Anne Begg MP Labour, Aberdeen South I am most proud of the role I played in persuading the House of Commons to support the changes to the regulations on the use of embryonic stem cells in medical research. I believe that this has the potential to lead to the discovery and development of treatments and cures for some of the most horrific degenerative diseases. 37 George Galloway MP Labour, Glasgow Kelvin I am proudest to have stood firmly against the new imperialism and Anglo-American aggression around the world. To have been a voice for the voiceless here in Britain, where so many have been marginalised in the fight for \"middle England\", and in the canyons of deprivation in the world. 38 Mike Gapes MP Labour, Ilford South My proudest achievement was to be part of the British government's team negotiating the Good Friday Agreement when I was parliamentary private secretary to Paul Murphy. The most moving achievement was shaking hands with people with no hands at the \"amputee camp\" in Sierra Leone in February this year, which I visited as a member of the defence select committee. 39 Neil Gerrard MP Labour, Walthamstow I was proud to be involved in persuading the government to produce the first national strategy for HIV; to stand up for rights of asylum seekers, particularly on the asylum and immigration bill; and to be a member of the commission of inquiry into the right of return of Palestinian refugees. 40 Christopher Gill MP Conservative, Ludlow My battle for the retention of smaller abattoirs has resulted in major changes, to be implemented in April, in the way that meat inspection charges are levied. My efforts to highlight the iniquities of the common fisheries policy have resulted in a change of Conservative party policy, which now says that we will take back control of our fishing waters. 41 Cheryl Gillan MP Conservative, Chesham and Amersham Being able to persuade social services that a care package could be worked out to enable an elderly constituent to stay at home and be nursed there, which was what the constituent wanted more than anything. 42 Linda Gilroy MP Labour, Plymouth Sutton One in four Plymouth people missed out on school and have low basic skills. My constituent Sue Torr learned to read at the age of 38. By backing her \"Shout It Out\" literacy project in Westminster I hope I have helped her help more people to do the same. 43 Tommy Graham MP Independent, Renfrewshire West The fight to retain jobs in the Royal Ordnance factory at Bishopstone is something I consider as a personal achievement. The need to secure an indigenous armaments industry is essential for the future of the national security of this country. 44 Jane Griffiths MP Labour, Reading East I'm most proud of having raised the issue of men's health, in particular testicular and prostate cancer. I persuaded male councillors and members of Reading FC to pose in the street wearing only underpants; established the all-party group on male cancers; and asked parliamentary questions resulting in the availability of testing for prostate cancer for every man who requests it. 45 Peter Hain MP trade and industry minister, Labour, Neath Playing a key campaigning role in winning the referendum for a Welsh Assembly and achieving a huge 30% swing from the crushing \"no\" vote in 1979. 46 Archibald Hamilton MP Conservative, Epsom and Ewell I would much prefer to comment on what I have failed to achieve as an MP since 1997, which is to make the press and media in this country any more responsible. They continue to be answerable to no one other than their proprietors and are increasingly courted by politicians. This leaves a serious democratic deficit. 47 Harriet Harman MP Labour Camberwell and Peckham Being part of the government that introduced the national childcare strategy and the new deal for lone parents. Then, as a backbencher, chairing Southwark's Childcare Partnership, which got 4,100 more after-school club places for local children; and supporting its new-deal personal advisers who helped make 28,000 children better off by helping their mothers move off benefits and into work. 48 Sir Alan Haselhurst MP Conservative, Saffron Walden I took particular pleasure in helping a constituent of Polish extraction who had served as a nurse in the allied war effort. Having survived the torpedoing of a ship, she was entitled to a pension, but was unable to prove that she had been aboard. I extracted from the MoD records proof of her service, which led to her receiving her pension. 49 Andrew Hunter MP Conservative, Basingstoke My private member's bill, which became the Road Traffic (Vehicle Testing) Act 1999; a government commitment to a quieter M3 surface through Basingstoke; to have been one of only a handful of mainland MPs who have consistently opposed the sell-out to terrorism in Northern Ireland. 50 Michael Jack MP Conservative, Fylde My worthwhile achievements include helping hundreds of constituents with problems; my work on the agriculture select committee; helping to win business for aerospace and nuclear workers; and masterminding an event to raise \u00a33,000 for the local hospice. 51 Ieuan Wyn Jones MP Leader, Plaid Cymru, Ynys Mn Despite its weaknesses, the Government of Wales Act 1998 represents a small but significant step forward for Wales. I'm glad to have taken part in the debate, both in Parliament and in helping to deliver a \"yes\" vote in the referendum. 52 Dr Lynne Jones MP Labour, Birmingham Selly Oak Child benefit, disability benefits and the state pension are all better as a result of the backbench \"rebellions\" in which I played a leading role. Through the all-party mental health group, I have helped mental health organisations work more effectively together. My persistence on behalf of constituents has secured a more just outcome in a large number of individual cases. 53 Tessa Jowell MP, education and employment minister Labour, Dulwich and West Norwood Delivering SureStart, the early-nurture programme for disadvantaged mums and their babies, because equality is a birthright. In my constituency, a new secondary school, a new community hospital promised, a police station kept open; and helping people such as Dr M, reunited with his daughter after eight years. 54 Robin Cook MP Foreign secretary Labour, Livingston Breaking the deadlock in the Lockerbie case; defending Kosovo; saving lives and relieving suffering in Sierra Leone; contributing to the fall of Milosevic; transforming Britain's relations with Europe; rebuilding respect for Britain in the world. 55 Fraser Kemp MP Labour, Houghton and Washington East Following the tragic death of two young constituents from carbon monoxide poisoning, I presented my fuel safety bill to the Commons. The bill has succeeded in raising awareness of the problem and in toughening up the legislation surrounding the installation of heating equipment. Four years in 40 words (continued) All talk?

But it has not yet made it all the way on to the international tourist map.

But in the colonnaded streets of crumbling Portuguese-style merchant houses, common in southern China, there is bitterness towards the US. The Chinese media have played a big part in creating the public mood, focusing on allegations that the US plane caused the collision,and infringed on Chinese airspace before landing. The way the stories are written has led many to believe that the collision was in Chinese airspace.

      "bodyText": "International monitors in Macedonia have complained to the government about the arrest and beating of scores of ethnic Albanian civilians, and the vandalising of dozens of houses, by security forces \"cleaning up\" after the offensive against Albanian guerrillas. Evidence of the damage was presented by representatives of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe as Macedonia was formally welcomed into the \"extended European family\" in Luxembourg. Flanked by EU foreign ministers, the Macedonian prime minister, Ljubco Georgievski, promised to meet the June deadline for improved relations between the ethnically Slav majority and the restive Albanian minority. Mr Georgievski spoke of his \"joy and pride\" at the signing of a \"stabilisation and association agreement\" with the EU which gives Macedonia generous trade terms and strong political support. Macedonia, which a month ago seemed close to civil war, is the first former Yugoslav republic to benefit from such an agreement. Croatia is next in line for a special relationship, while the wealthier and long-peaceful Slovenia is already negotiating full EU membership. The OSCE representatives visited most of the mountain villages suspected of being Albanian guerrilla bases and returned with sheafs of photographs of homes ransacked and marked with crosses as a token of Macedonian triumph. The Slavic Macedonians are Orthodox Christian. Most Albanians are Muslim. \"We were pleasantly surprised by the army's success but we don't want silly faux pas caused by heavy-handedness and beatings,\" a western diplomat said yesterday. In the worst incident reported by the monitors, the army killed a boy of 16 who had returned by taxi with two companions from the city of Tetovo to Selce, once the stronghold of the self-styled National Liberation Army, to look after their sheep. He was shot four times. One of the other boys, a deaf-mute, is said to be seriously traumatised by the incident, which occurred on Friday. The Macedonian army says three suspected NLA guerrillas approached troops, who fired in self-defence. The observers found that every car in Selce had its windows smashed. Only a few people were left in the village, from which the entire civilian population fled during the intense artillery bombardment which preceded an assault by special forces and police officers. Cupboard drawers and clothes were strewn over the floor, suggesting that there had been a search for jewellery and valuables. But television sets, videos, and fridges were largely still in place, unlike in the Albanian homes looted by Serb forces in Kosovo two years ago. In the nearby village of Sipkovica, which has more than 200 houses, only about 10 had been searched, and nothing was broken. No weapons were found there. In other villages the police arrested 200 people in the first two days of their sweep. The monitors have photographs of dozens of severely bruised men.

Early on there was some direct action, with women blocking the A40 at Sennybridge.</p> <p>They held a procession and a mock funeral and some local lads managed to stall trucks bringing pyre materials as they ground up the hill past historic Llywell church to the chosen sites. That road is now barricaded by police who maintain a strong presence.</p> <p>Just over a week ago, a man, who protesters insist was nothing to do with them, drove a digger down that hill and into a police van, trapping and injuring the officer inside.

Pyres take time to build. It is quicker and more effective to take the carcasses to one site to bury or burn them.\"</p> <p>The people of the Usk valley disagree.

A spokeswoman for the Welsh assembly said the Eppynt site was the best available. \"We took the advice of the environment agency in Wales before the decision was taken,\" she said. \"Disposal of carcasses at farms is not viable. Pyres take time to build. It is quicker and more effective to take the carcasses to one site to bury or burn them.\" The people of the Usk valley disagree. Another sign at Trecastle reads: \"Welsh assembly: you are the weakest link.

Ms Milosevic, under criminal investigation for firing shots with a pistol as her father was being driven away from his Belgrade villa to prison on April 1, arrived at the family's mansion in Pozarevac on Thursday in a black BMW escorted by other vehicles. After Mrs Markovic's arrival on Friday, Mr Veljkovic told the mansion's security guards Otpor would hold protests there if she did not leave. The two women left the town half an hour later, witnesses said. Their subsequent whereabouts were unclear but they were believed to be back in Belgrade where Mr Milosevic is in jail under investigation by Serbian justice authorities for alleged corruption and abuse of office. Before the two women left Pozarevac on Friday, reporters saw plainclothes police guarding the mansion, while uniformed colleagues barred all approaches. Belgrade's governing reform coalition, DOS, promised during negotiations over the surrender of the former president that it would guarantee the safety of his family and property.",

We have a list of projects that are in the pre-appraisal phase. It is likely that in the course of the year the EIB will be financing 3G projects,\" said the spokesman. </p> <p>The EIB, the European Union's in-house bank, has already lent \u20ac11bn (\u00a36.9m) to the telecoms industry, including \u20ac4.5bn to the mobile telephone sector, over the past five years. It is also understood that the Luxembourg-based bank has had talks with the European commission - which is keen to ensure 3G services are introduced as quickly as possible - about the provision of long-term loans to telecoms companies. </p> <p>Loans to the telecoms sector would be in line with the EIB's mandate to help promote a knowledge-based economy in Europe. However, the bank would want to ensure that any lending went to financially viable projects. It is keen to avoid any suggestion of its resources being used to bail out a sector under heavy pressure from the cost of acquiring 3G mobile phone licences and building the networks. Roll-out costs in western Europe are estimated at \u20ac75bn. </p> <p>Confirmation of the EIB's likely involvement in the introduction of 3G networks comes alongside news that France is pushing back the date for its second auction of 3G licences until after the presidential and parliamentary election in May next year. </p> <p>France's initial auction saw only two bidders - France T\u00e9l\u00e9com subsidiary Orange and SFR C\u00e9g\u00e9tel - line up for the sale of four licences as a number of potential buyers declined to bid, with at least one complaining about the price the government was asking. </p> <p>The second round was scheduled for the end of this year but appears to have been put back. \"This is a sensitive issue in France and you could see that the presidential and general elections could contribute to the slowdown of certain decisions,\" said a government spokesman.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The European Investment Bank has confirmed that it is in talks with telecommunications companies over financing for third generation (3G) mobile phone networks. The bank is considering projects in Britain, Italy and Germany, said a spokesman. \"We are in contact with telecom operators. We have a list of projects that are in the pre-appraisal phase. It is likely that in the course of the year the EIB will be financing 3G projects,\" said the spokesman. The EIB, the European Union's in-house bank, has already lent \u20ac11bn (\u00a36.9m) to the telecoms industry, including \u20ac4.5bn to the mobile telephone sector, over the past five years. It is also understood that the Luxembourg-based bank has had talks with the European commission - which is keen to ensure 3G services are introduced as quickly as possible - about the provision of long-term loans to telecoms companies. Loans to the telecoms sector would be in line with the EIB's mandate to help promote a knowledge-based economy in Europe. However, the bank would want to ensure that any lending went to financially viable projects. It is keen to avoid any suggestion of its resources being used to bail out a sector under heavy pressure from the cost of acquiring 3G mobile phone licences and building the networks. Roll-out costs in western Europe are estimated at \u20ac75bn. Confirmation of the EIB's likely involvement in the introduction of 3G networks comes alongside news that France is pushing back the date for its second auction of 3G licences until after the presidential and parliamentary election in May next year. France's initial auction saw only two bidders - France T\u00e9l\u00e9com subsidiary Orange and SFR C\u00e9g\u00e9tel - line up for the sale of four licences as a number of potential buyers declined to bid, with at least one complaining about the price the government was asking. The second round was scheduled for the end of this year but appears to have been put back. \"This is a sensitive issue in France and you could see that the presidential and general elections could contribute to the slowdown of certain decisions,\" said a government spokesman.",

In recent weeks, the City has pulverised the company's shares for its failure to disclose the impact of the US slowdown on its business. </p> <p>In the meantime, leading shares drifted higher in thin volume, finding support from a strong performance on Wall Street after online book seller Amazon said its first quarter figures would beat expectations. </p> <p>With <strong> Shell </strong> , up 19.5p to 561.5p, and <strong> BP </strong> , 18.5p higher at 598.5p, leading the way, the FTSE 100 came to rest 61.8 points higher at 5,663.3. </p> <p>No one was prepared to read much into the gains, with most of the London brokerages operating at half strength in the run-up to Easter and with a number of tricky hurdles to be negotiated this week. Dealers are wary of today's figures from Motorola and Thursday's US retail sales data. </p> <p>The tech sector remained under pressure from Friday's profits warning from <strong> Autonomy </strong> , down a further 25p to 300p. The FTSE Techmark 100 dropped 31.03 points to 1,749.08 with Anglo-Dutch software group <strong> CMG</strong> marked down 30.5p at 400p after a strange research note from Merrill Lynch. </p> <p>Though Merrill did not change its profits forecasts, the note outlined potential \"worst case\" scenarios for the company, apparently to give its clients an idea of just how bad things could be. </p> <p>Elsewhere, fears that the slowdown in IT spending has reached Europe continued to dog <strong> Logica </strong> , down 32p to 770p, and <strong> Misys </strong> , off 15p to 400p. </p> <p>Telecoms testing firm <strong> Spirent </strong> , 30p lower at 305p, was still suffering from last week's profits warning from rival Agilent. </p> <p>A strong performance from media display group <strong> Photobition </strong> , up 2.25p to 37.75p on the back of wild talk of a management buyout, was not enough to stop the FTSE mid 250 from closing lower. Dragged down by a poor showing by tech stocks it closed off 8.3 points at 6,043.3. </p> <p>But sugar producer <strong> Tate &amp; Lyle </strong> , which has warned on profits four times in the past year, was on the way up following a recommendation from Schroder Salomon Smith Barney. </p> <p>In a note to clients, Schroder said a meeting with Tate had provided further indications of a strong recovery in the year ahead. </p> <p>Apparently, Tate has been able to extract double-digit price increases for its products from soft drinks makers and Schroder is predicting a 39% uplift in earnings this year. Tate shares closed 3.75p higher at 222.75p. </p> <p>Lower down the market, <strong> Nord Anglia Education </strong> , which provides back office administration for schools, rose 6.5p to 196.5p on talk of a big contract award from a London borough. </p> <p>The cosmetics-with-a-conscience chain, <strong> Body Shop,</strong> advanced 2p to 80p as rumours of a bid from rival Lush were dusted down and given a fresh airing.</p>",

According to the gossip, a number of WPP's big American clients have pulled the plug on expensive advertising campaigns in the last four weeks as evidence of a US recession has mounted. Traders pointed out that WPP, which makes half of its profits in the US, is already budgeting for zero growth in global advertising revenue this year and will not publish first quarter figures until mid-May. Nevertheless, the fact the market has got a bee in its bonnet about WPP's exposure to the slowing US economy is ominous news. If WPP does not move to reassure investors about current trading soon, say traders, it could find itself in the same pickle as Marconi , off 15p to 310p yesterday. In recent weeks, the City has pulverised the company's shares for its failure to disclose the impact of the US slowdown on its business. In the meantime, leading shares drifted higher in thin volume, finding support from a strong performance on Wall Street after online book seller Amazon said its first quarter figures would beat expectations. With Shell , up 19.5p to 561.5p, and BP , 18.5p higher at 598.5p, leading the way, the FTSE 100 came to rest 61.8 points higher at 5,663.3. No one was prepared to read much into the gains, with most of the London brokerages operating at half strength in the run-up to Easter and with a number of tricky hurdles to be negotiated this week. Dealers are wary of today's figures from Motorola and Thursday's US retail sales data. The tech sector remained under pressure from Friday's profits warning from Autonomy , down a further 25p to 300p. The FTSE Techmark 100 dropped 31.03 points to 1,749.08 with Anglo-Dutch software group CMG marked down 30.5p at 400p after a strange research note from Merrill Lynch. Though Merrill did not change its profits forecasts, the note outlined potential \"worst case\" scenarios for the company, apparently to give its clients an idea of just how bad things could be. Elsewhere, fears that the slowdown in IT spending has reached Europe continued to dog Logica , down 32p to 770p, and Misys , off 15p to 400p. Telecoms testing firm Spirent , 30p lower at 305p, was still suffering from last week's profits warning from rival Agilent. A strong performance from media display group Photobition , up 2.25p to 37.75p on the back of wild talk of a management buyout, was not enough to stop the FTSE mid 250 from closing lower. Dragged down by a poor showing by tech stocks it closed off 8.3 points at 6,043.3. But sugar producer Tate &amp; Lyle , which has warned on profits four times in the past year, was on the way up following a recommendation from Schroder Salomon Smith Barney. In a note to clients, Schroder said a meeting with Tate had provided further indications of a strong recovery in the year ahead. Apparently, Tate has been able to extract double-digit price increases for its products from soft drinks makers and Schroder is predicting a 39% uplift in earnings this year. Tate shares closed 3.75p higher at 222.75p. Lower down the market, Nord Anglia Education , which provides back office administration for schools, rose 6.5p to 196.5p on talk of a big contract award from a London borough. The cosmetics-with-a-conscience chain, Body Shop, advanced 2p to 80p as rumours of a bid from rival Lush were dusted down and given a fresh airing.",

The Germans will also take on the British company's \u00a34.5bn of debt. </p> <p>The deal will be heavily scrutinised by regulators in Europe and the US because Powergen last year bought LG&amp;E in Kentucky. It might take a year for all hurdles to be cleared. </p> <p>If it does go through, the cash deal will trigger several share options for Mr Wallis which together with his existing personal share holding would give the former power station manager more than \u00a33m. Last year he was paid \u00a3800,000. </p> <p>His finance director, Peter Dickson, will receive \u00a31.6m and chief executive Nick Baldmore than \u00a31m through share options. </p> <p>Mr Wallis insisted the E.ON offer was good for shareholders, customers and employees alike. He had \"no regrets at all\" about building up the company and then selling it. </p> <p>He complained that Powergen had been through 10 \"pretty bloody\" years as a relatively small utility surrounded by larger ones. </p> <p>It had been easier for other privatised utilities such as Scottish Power and Centrica, which had a telecom arm or permission to accumulate a wider range of assets, he argued. </p> <p>The 765p-a-share offer represents a 26% premium to the price in January when the group admitted it was in talks. It is 59p better than Friday's closing price. </p> <p>Powergen last night closed up 13.5p at 719.5p with investors arguing that was a fair price given a formal deal was at least 12 months away. </p> <p>If either side walks away from the deal there is a \u00a350m \"break\" price. But few expect a rival bidder to come forward. </p> <p>E.ON's move into Britain follows Electricit\u00e9 de France snapping up London Electricity and Sweb, and E.ON's German rival, RWE, buying Thames Water last year. <br> <strong>Related articles</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/story/0,3604,470904,00.html\">09.04.2001 : German firm takes over Powergen</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4119145,00.html\">18.01.20 01: German rival opens talks with Powergen</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4060327,00.html\">17.09.20 01: Powergen hit by profit warning</a><br><strong>Useful links</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.pgen.com/news/\">Powergen</a><br><a href=\"http://www.eon.com/online/Push/en/start/8244553894/home#\">Eon</a><br><a href=\"http://195.153.208.245/\">Live webcast of the announcement</a><br><a href=\"http://www.eon.com/online/Push/en/popups/8254725049/fs_live2_04_en\">Press release</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Ed Wallis, chairman of Powergen, yesterday put himself in line for a \u00a33m windfall after agreeing to sell his company to the Germans for what he admitted was a \"disappointing\" \u00a39.6bn. He effectively blamed the end of independence on Britain's regulators and politicians who had left Powergen struggling for the critical mass it needed to become a global player. Mr Wallis hoped the partnership with E.ON, the Dusseldorf-based power and water utility, would create an \"Exxon of the electricity and gas sector\". The combine will be the second-largest energy service provider in the world and has ambitions to expand through acquisition in Britain and the US, according to E.ON chairman Ulrich Hartmann. E.ON, itself a merger between Veba and Viag, has offered 765p per share, valuing Powergen shares at \u00a35.1bn. The Germans will also take on the British company's \u00a34.5bn of debt. The deal will be heavily scrutinised by regulators in Europe and the US because Powergen last year bought LG&amp;E in Kentucky. It might take a year for all hurdles to be cleared. If it does go through, the cash deal will trigger several share options for Mr Wallis which together with his existing personal share holding would give the former power station manager more than \u00a33m. Last year he was paid \u00a3800,000. His finance director, Peter Dickson, will receive \u00a31.6m and chief executive Nick Baldmore than \u00a31m through share options. Mr Wallis insisted the E.ON offer was good for shareholders, customers and employees alike. He had \"no regrets at all\" about building up the company and then selling it. He complained that Powergen had been through 10 \"pretty bloody\" years as a relatively small utility surrounded by larger ones. It had been easier for other privatised utilities such as Scottish Power and Centrica, which had a telecom arm or permission to accumulate a wider range of assets, he argued. The 765p-a-share offer represents a 26% premium to the price in January when the group admitted it was in talks. It is 59p better than Friday's closing price. Powergen last night closed up 13.5p at 719.5p with investors arguing that was a fair price given a formal deal was at least 12 months away. If either side walks away from the deal there is a \u00a350m \"break\" price. But few expect a rival bidder to come forward. E.ON's move into Britain follows Electricit\u00e9 de France snapping up London Electricity and Sweb, and E.ON's German rival, RWE, buying Thames Water last year.

But I promise that I will spare no effort to achieve positive results,\" Mr Mandela said yesterday at the end of his one-day visit to the Libyan capital.</p> <p>Mr Mandela, who has previously said he trusted Col Gadafy \"without reservation\", did not reveal the new evidence or specifically say he was convinced by it. The former South African president is already scheduled to meet Mr Blair in London on April 28.</p> <p>Megrahi was jailed for life in January by a Scottish court sitting in the Netherlands for planting the bomb on the PanAm flight that killed 270 people in 1988.</p> <p>Two years ago as South Africa's president, Mr Mandela played a crucial role along with Saudi Arabia in breaking the international deadlock over the Lockerbie bombing when he helped persuade Col Gadafy to surrender Megrahi and his co-accused, Al-Amin Khalifa Fhimah, for trial on neutral ground.

      "bodyText": "Nelson Mandela has said he will present Tony Blair with fresh evidence supposedly clearing the Libyan intelligence officer jailed for the Lockerbie bombing. The move follows a meeting with the Libyan leader, Muammar Gadafy, and with the family of the imprisoned terrorist, Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi,, in Tripoli on Sunday. The former South African president is also expected to press Mr Blair to lift the remaining sanctions against Libya. \"I don't promise anything, but the leader [Colonel Gadafy] informed me of facts which I did not know and I will visit Britain soon to discuss this case with its prime minister. But I promise that I will spare no effort to achieve positive results,\" Mr Mandela said yesterday at the end of his one-day visit to the Libyan capital. Mr Mandela, who has previously said he trusted Col Gadafy \"without reservation\", did not reveal the new evidence or specifically say he was convinced by it. The former South African president is already scheduled to meet Mr Blair in London on April 28. Megrahi was jailed for life in January by a Scottish court sitting in the Netherlands for planting the bomb on the PanAm flight that killed 270 people in 1988. Two years ago as South Africa's president, Mr Mandela played a crucial role along with Saudi Arabia in breaking the international deadlock over the Lockerbie bombing when he helped persuade Col Gadafy to surrender Megrahi and his co-accused, Al-Amin Khalifa Fhimah, for trial on neutral ground. Mr Fhimah was acquitted by the court. In February, Mr Mandela accused London and Washington of reneging on the agreement by imposing fresh conditions for the complete lifting of United Nations sanctions against Libya which have so far only been suspended. Britain and the US say sanctions should only be scrapped when Tripoli admits official responsibility for the destruction of PanAm 103 and pays compensation to the families of the victims. \"We had got certain guarantees, one of the most important [being] that if Libya delivered the suspects, the sanctions would be lifted. Not suspended, lifted,\" Mr Mandela said at the time. \"We expected that the west would honour its undertaking. Unfortunately, that was not done.\" Mr Mandela also said he expected Britain to abide by an agreement to allow the UN a role in overseeing Megrahi's imprisonment. Libya has repeatedly denied responsibility for the bombing and claims that the court that jailed Megrahi was acting under political pressure from Washington and London. After the verdict, Col Gadafy promised to reveal evidence that would prove Megrahi's innocence and leave the Scottish judges with three choices - suicide, resignation or exposing \"the truth\". But the Libyan leader has yet to provide the promised proof. Mr Mandela has not been afraid to side with Col Gadafy before on numerous occasions despite criticism from western governments which regard the Libyan government as a terrorist regime. Col Gadafy was a consistent supporter of the African National Congress when it was banned in South Africa and most western governments were soft on the apartheid regime. Mr Mandela has accused the Libyan leader's critics of hypocrisy and said he would not abandon Col Gadafy or other controversial friends such as Fidel Castro.",

There is resentment among some reservists, and among their parents, about being sent to the frontline, while ultra-Orthodox Jews are exempt on religious grounds. Of the 31 Israeli soldiers killed since September, five have been reservists. Among the grievances is the lack of compensation for disruptions caused by absences from work.

After a quiet start, the campaign grew increasingly bitter, the candidates slinging mud and engaging in angry exchanges at public meetings. But a new tone was struck by a series of automated telephone calls purporting to be campaign messages. In one a voice asked for contributions for Steve Soboroff and his \"conservative coalition\". It ended: \"Soboroff's polling numbers have been falling and we have become entirely dependent upon Jewish money. \"Thank you and thank you from Steve Soboroff.\" Another, purporting to come from the influential LA county supervisor Gloria Molina, warned voters that Mr Villaraigosa was sympathetic to criminals and soft on crime. Fear of crime and the role of the police are key issues in the campaign. In fact, Ms Molina is backing Mr Villaraigosa, and she has now sent a genuine message out on his behalf with her endorsement. The tactics were condemned yesterday by politicians and religious leaders in the city, which has the second largest Jewish population, after New York. \"Clearly someone or some campaign has injected religion into the mayoral campaign to seek partisan advantage,\" said David Lehrer of the Anti-Defamation League. The current Republican mayor, Richard Riordan, who is not seeking re-election, also condemned the messages. \"Los Angeles is the most diverse city in the United States,\" he said. \"Angelenos have come a long, long way toward getting along with each other.

Alan Bennett's accomplished reworking of his stage play is both a handsome historical drama about skulduggery at court - epitomised by Rupert Everett's foppish, scheming Prince of Wales - and a moving study of the man inside the ermine. Nigel Hawthorne's George is magnificent, lurching from nobility to wild-eyed tantrums to, under the regime of progressive doctor Ian Holm, utter wretchedness in a soiled nappy. </p> <p><strong> Excalibur </strong><br> (John Boorman, 1981) <br>8pm, Sky Cinema </p> <p>Boorman seems to have got lost in the mists of time with this confusing version of the Arthurian legend: the narrative is all but engulfed by whizz-bang visuals. However, the images are often brilliant, there are savage battles, curious sex (armour-clad Nigel Terry roasting by the fire with Helen Mirren), and Nicol Williams's Merlin is just dotty. </p> <p><strong> La Dolce Vita </strong> <br>(Federico Fellini, 1960)<br> 8pm, FilmFour </p> <p>One of Fellini's brilliant, semi-autobiographical extravaganzas, which has Marcello Mastroianni as a provincial hack seduced by the more-sour-than-sweet life of Rome's finest. He is fascinated by a film star (Anita Ekberg) and a rich nymphomaniac (Anouk Aimee); he ignores the love of Yvonne Furneaux. The city is evoked throughout by Fellini's flamboyant imagery. </p> <p><strong> Analyze This </strong><br> (Harold Ramis, 1999) <br>10pm, Sky Premier </p> <p>The central (some say only) joke in this mafia comedy - a sort of Feel-Goodfellas - has a mobster on the psychiatrist's couch, trying to make sense of his violent impulses and other anti-social behaviour. It may seem overly familiar to viewers of TV's The Sopranos, but in Ramis's well-handled, cleverly scripted story it's a very good joke. And the two leads are terrific: Robert De Niro, revisiting his Scorsese mobsters down the years, as deadly Paul Viti; wisecracking Billy Crystal as the doc, Ben Sobol: \"What is my goal here? To make you a happy, well adjusted gangster?\". </p> <p><strong> Human Traffic</strong><br> (Justin Kerrigan, 1999) <br>1.15am, FilmFour </p> <p>In Cardiff, five friends forget about their dead-end jobs for a weekend of clubs, drugs, drink and parties. The performances - by John Simm, Lorraine Pilkington, Shaun Parkes, Nicola Reynolds and Danny Dyer - are vibrant, Dave Bennett's camerawork has mindbending energy, and Kerrigan, in his directorial debut, captures both the agony and the Ecstasy of \"48 hours off from the world, man\". </p> <p><strong> Sports</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Live Snooker</strong><br> 2pm, Sky Sports 2</p> <p> With the countdown to this year's World Championships now very much on - it starts in Sheffield in less than two weeks - now is the time for players to finely hone their form or, for those who failed to make the cut for the Crucible, to prove their quality in what will be their last tournament of the season. Snooker, often rather dull to be frank, is starting to hot up.</p>",

Excalibur (John Boorman, 1981) 8pm, Sky Cinema Boorman seems to have got lost in the mists of time with this confusing version of the Arthurian legend: the narrative is all but engulfed by whizz-bang visuals. However, the images are often brilliant, there are savage battles, curious sex (armour-clad Nigel Terry roasting by the fire with Helen Mirren), and Nicol Williams's Merlin is just dotty. La Dolce Vita (Federico Fellini, 1960) 8pm, FilmFour One of Fellini's brilliant, semi-autobiographical extravaganzas, which has Marcello Mastroianni as a provincial hack seduced by the more-sour-than-sweet life of Rome's finest. He is fascinated by a film star (Anita Ekberg) and a rich nymphomaniac (Anouk Aimee); he ignores the love of Yvonne Furneaux. The city is evoked throughout by Fellini's flamboyant imagery. Analyze This (Harold Ramis, 1999) 10pm, Sky Premier The central (some say only) joke in this mafia comedy - a sort of Feel-Goodfellas - has a mobster on the psychiatrist's couch, trying to make sense of his violent impulses and other anti-social behaviour. It may seem overly familiar to viewers of TV's The Sopranos, but in Ramis's well-handled, cleverly scripted story it's a very good joke. And the two leads are terrific: Robert De Niro, revisiting his Scorsese mobsters down the years, as deadly Paul Viti; wisecracking Billy Crystal as the doc, Ben Sobol: \"What is my goal here? To make you a happy, well adjusted gangster?\". Human Traffic (Justin Kerrigan, 1999) 1.15am, FilmFour In Cardiff, five friends forget about their dead-end jobs for a weekend of clubs, drugs, drink and parties. The performances - by John Simm, Lorraine Pilkington, Shaun Parkes, Nicola Reynolds and Danny Dyer - are vibrant, Dave Bennett's camerawork has mindbending energy, and Kerrigan, in his directorial debut, captures both the agony and the Ecstasy of \"48 hours off from the world, man\". Sports Live Snooker 2pm, Sky Sports 2 With the countdown to this year's World Championships now very much on - it starts in Sheffield in less than two weeks - now is the time for players to finely hone their form or, for those who failed to make the cut for the Crucible, to prove their quality in what will be their last tournament of the season. Snooker, often rather dull to be frank, is starting to hot up.",

There were no boundaries to Bull's activities: he launched and ran a series of monthly and quarterly journals dealing with Japanese affairs: an independent journal on banking and another journal to analyse the pyschological aspects of international conflict, International Minds. He was a director and trustee of the Tablet and the Universe; governor of Westminster Choir School and St Thomas More School and of St Mary's College, Strawberry Hill 1976-87; a member of the United Kingdom committee of the European Cultural Foundation since 1987 and co-founder in 1996 - and director - of the Institute of Public Enterprise Studies. He was appointed OBE in 1990. He is survived by his widow and four children. George Bull, journalist, writer, translator, consultant; born August 23 1929; died April 6 2001",

This reveals that there are more than 200 cancers, most of which are never debated in the media.

Could it be that breast cancer has become fashionable to the detriment of other types of cancer awareness?</p> <p>Delyth Morgan, chief executive of Breakthrough, refutes this. \"Seven years ago, when I started at Breakthrough, no one talked about cancer of any form, least of all breast cancer which was combining two taboos, sex and death. The Macmillan report reflects how successful we are. We learned the lessons of the Aids campaigners in the 80s and we have worked hard to present the issues creatively. For that reason, Breakthrough has become a trailblazer for all cancer charities and many have mimicked our style of campaigning.\"</p> <p>That much is certainly true: the Cancer Research Campaign recently produced a series of sexy ads featuring perfect bottoms to boost awareness of bowel cancer - but as yet there have been precious few glossy magazines fighting to give away black ribbons commemorating lung cancer awareness month, fewer still supermodels willing to adopt the disease as their pet charity. Well, they wouldn't, would they? That would mean stubbing out those super-chic, appetite-suppressing Marlboro Lights.</p> <p>Breast cancer kills more than 13,000 women every year in the UK and more than 30,000 are diagnosed as having it. However, the disease is most prevalent in women over 65, least common among those under 30. \"Our report shows that breast cancer awareness among the young is very high, thanks to these celebrity campaigns, and there is a very high degree of public interest and sympathy,\" says Deborah Lincoln of Macmillan. \"This is good because cancer is a long-term disease, so they will know what to look for when they're older. The problem is, even with breast cancer, no campaign or magazine is really reaching out to older women, the at-risk group.\"</p> <p>Certainly it is ironic that breast cancer is marketed as a young woman's disease, which it patently is not, while lung cancer is associated with elderly men. In fact lung cancer is rising among women at the rate of 11% per year, a pattern set to worsen given the high number of teenage girls who smoke. A recent study indicated that 33% of 11-15-year-old girls are regular smokers (far more than boys), many drawn by the promise of losing weight. So why are there no campaigns with glamorous spokesmodels getting the message through to them?</p> <p>Lincoln says wryly: \"Well, when you're 15, you think you're immortal, don't you? Getting the message through is never going to be easy, but added to that, there isn't the same media interest in lung cancer. There is far less public sympathy because many people take the view that sufferers of the disease are themselves to blame through smoking.\"</p> <p>It is worth noting, too, that most of the celebrities involved with cancer charities tend to be women. \"Men don't like talking about illness,\" Lincoln says. \"And a lot of men are embarrassed about talking about their nether regions. Even our prostate cancer helpline gets more calls from women than men, presumably wives phoning on behalf of their husbands. Robbie Williams has started campaigning for the Institute of Cancer Research and George Carman QC talked about his cancer before he died, so things are changing slowly.\"</p> <p>Morgan agrees. \"I don't know if I'd say cancer was a gender issue. There's a women's media that has given us opportunities to debate the disease. Now men's magazines are catching up and beginning to discuss health.

She yowls from room to room, beside herself, frotting against the furniture and male guests' trainers.

She needs to get grubbier and much, much plainer. Walking about not knowing there is baby sick (or \"posset\" as it is winsomely called in baby manuals) on either shoulder would be a good place to start. Partnered mothers get told to change their tops; their single equivalents wander about all day looking revolting.</p> <p>It's not just baby sick, or indeed curiously liquid baby poo; later, there's also poster paint, crumbs of Play-Doh (in the hair, usually), small stickers of dinosaurs which it amuses your children to attach to your backside, secretly, just as you're about to go out somewhere where backsides matter.

You would need to do more detailed work.\" But he speculated that women doctors, who were often intelligent, high achievers and perfectionists, might have a personality profile that made them more vulnerable. The British Medical Association said: \"There is an urgent need for family-friendly specialities in every speciality. It is particularly important to discover what drives these women to suicide since more than half the current medical graduates are women.\" The Department of Health said: \"All the strands are coming together to improve doctors' working conditions so hopefully these rates will come down.\"",

Officials said the review would be conducted by the lord chamberlain of the household, Lord Luce, and completed within weeks. He can consult family members and outside advisers, including judges and civil servants, but the guidelines will devised internally. One official said: \"There are a number of facets to be considered, and one person from the outside will not necessarily have the expertise for them all. Whether the guidelines are eventually published will depend on the outcome.\" Lord Luce's inquiry will concentrate on how to avoid potential conflicts of interest, while maintaining the right of family members, such as Sophie, Countess of Wessex, to continue working. She may find her public relations skills restricted to charity work. There is likely to be renewed emphasis on making no con tentious or partisan remarks, even in private. Constitutional specialists said other members of the extended royal family seemed able to earn their living without controversy, including the Duke of Gloucester, who is an architect, and Viscount Linley, Princess Margaret's son, who runs a furniture business. Vernon Bogdanor, professor of government at Oxford University, said: \"It is coming to be expected that most members of the royal family will be involved in outside activities, and just like everyone else they have to avoid a conflict of interest.\" Monarchs abroad, while usually subject to written constitutions, do not appear to have guidelines for their business activities. Most princes are expected to work. The Dutch royal family's website shows that Queen Beatrix's husband, Claus, served on several boards of directors until he retired. Willem-Alexander, heir to the throne as Prince of Orange, served in the navy and now interests himself in water management. His brother, Johan Friso, is a mechanical engineer and former management consultant with McKinsey, now employed by the investment bank Goldman Sachs in London.

Gordon Brown, chancellor Likely republican, but keeps views private. Yesterday noted Palace was debating size of Civil List. Robin Cook, foreign secretary Shares an interest in horses but little else. Jack Straw, home secretary In opposition proposed that royal family model itself on bicycling Scandinavians. Stephen Byers, trade Was first in Cabinet to comment on affair - he would 'make his excuses and leave if offered gifts by unknown sheikh'.

      "bodyText": "The Duke of York has a problem with his public image- even though he is the Queen's favourite son, he has served his country with honour for more than 20 years as a Royal Navy helicopter pilot, and he has even come through a failed marriage without bringing too much disgrace on the royal family. But last November, when news came of Prince Andrew's career change when he leaves the navy this summer, the reaction to his choice among Buckingham Palace aides and politicians was, at best, amusement, at worst, astonishment. Most had assumed he would be on the golf course, battling to reduce his seven handicap. Instead, the prince told the palace's twice-yearly Way Ahead Group, he would become an international figurehead for British industry. As a roving ambassador for British Trade International, the government body for promoting exports and inward investment, he will replace his cousin, the Duke of Kent, and accompany trade missions and lead promotional visits overseas. The post, which he takes up in July, is unpaid but covers all travel expenses. The prince has a \u00a3249,000-a-year allowance from the Queen. \"I am thoroughly looking forward to [the new job],\" he said recently, \"because it will be a complete contrast to my role in the navy, where I am necessarily working behind closed doors. \"Now I will have to deal with the press.\" The appointment had the backing of the Queen, but stunned palace aides and politicians; they believe Prince Andrew's personality and lifestyle make him a disastrous choice. That fear, of the prince \"dealing with the press\", will be reinforced by what has happened to the Countess of Wessex. Even Prince Charles is understood to have voiced reservations about his brother's suitability. One Labour MP said last night: \"When I heard about this I couldn't believe it. \"It shows an appalling lack of judgment. I suppose there are some countries where his presence might impress, but he is a liability.\" However the prince is convinced he can help restore the royal family's battered reputation. Peter Mandelson is understood to have given behind-the scenes backing for Prince Andrew's cause. The former Northern Ireland secretary met him while working on the NSPCC's Full Stop campaign against child abuse, which Prince Andrew chaired. Within weeks of the ambassador announcement, however, Prince Andrew was making what seemed a midlife bid to reclaim his reputation for high living after almost 10 years in the sidelines. In January, to his mother's great annoyance, he was photographed sunbathing on a luxury catamarin off Thailand, surrounded by topless women. He was staying at the exclusive Amanpuri resort on Phuket as a guest of another contact made through the NSPCC campaign: Johan Eliasch, millionaire owner of Head, the tennis equipment company. That episode was followed by sightings apparently showing Prince Andrew's return to playboy habits: outside Soho clubs like China White, at glitterati bashes in Los Angeles, or turning up at a hookers and pimps halloween party in New York. Central to the reinvention has been the prince's partner at the New York party, Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late disgraced media mogul - an association that caused concern among palace aides. In recent months, the pair have spent a lot of time together in a lifestyle that has revived doubts about the prince's suitability to be the international representative of British industry. \"My fear is that he thinks this job will be some kind of sinecure,\" said one MP. The response of Martin O'Neill, chairman of the Commons trade and industry select committee, was marginally more diplomatic. \"Provided he has no vested or conflicting interests, then one can imagine that his appointment would not be to the detriment of our interests,\" said Mr O'Neill. There is also the fear that Prince Andrew has inherited an unenviable knack for offensive gaffes from his father, Prince Philip.

      "body": "<p>I note that British Transport Police are assisting the CPS in considering whether or not to bring charges against Railtrack and Thames Trains for corporate manslaughter (Paddington rail crash charges considered, April 9). These charges might concern Simon Osborne, the secretary and solicitor for Railtrack and a member of the board of the British Transport Police Committee, where he sits alongside the managing directors of First Group and Chiltern Railways.</p> <p>Last August, Osborne wrote to the Home Office protesting that the newer tighter laws proposed for corporate manslaughter were too tough. Ian Johnston, who takes over as chief constable of the BTP next month, was appointed by the committee on which Osborne sits. The resulting tangle of responsibility needs sorting out sooner rather than later. The government's intention to wait for \"a suitable legislative opportunity\" to set up a replacement independent police authority looks complacent. And as of any \"independent\" authority, we must ask the question, independent of whom?

      "bodyText": "I note that British Transport Police are assisting the CPS in considering whether or not to bring charges against Railtrack and Thames Trains for corporate manslaughter (Paddington rail crash charges considered, April 9). These charges might concern Simon Osborne, the secretary and solicitor for Railtrack and a member of the board of the British Transport Police Committee, where he sits alongside the managing directors of First Group and Chiltern Railways. Last August, Osborne wrote to the Home Office protesting that the newer tighter laws proposed for corporate manslaughter were too tough. Ian Johnston, who takes over as chief constable of the BTP next month, was appointed by the committee on which Osborne sits. The resulting tangle of responsibility needs sorting out sooner rather than later. The government's intention to wait for \"a suitable legislative opportunity\" to set up a replacement independent police authority looks complacent. And as of any \"independent\" authority, we must ask the question, independent of whom? The government, the rail industry, or the rail users? Dr Chris Williams European Centre for the Study of Policing, Open University Chris.Williams@open.ac.uk It is frustrating to hear government ministers wringing their hands over fare rises (Go by air or road, says transport minister, April 9) when the solution is sitting in their in-tray. The government is currently re-privatising the railway by offering companies longer franchises of up to 20 years. In drawing up new contracts the government is free to rewrite the rules on fares regulation. Yet it is quietly allowing the existing, inadequate system of fare regulation to roll forward into new franchise contracts with no consultation, no debate, and no parliamentary approval. Jonathan Bray Transport 2000 Does Lord Macdonald realise that not everybody owns a car and there are limited destinations for air travellers? Why not re-nationalise our rail system, which is much more efficient and environmentally sustainable form of transport compared to road or air travel? Martin Arundell Glasgow m.arundell@freeuk.com",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>At around 9pm on March 10 1995, Loraine Whiting's estranged and violent husband, Len Carter, turned up on the doorstep of her home in Sittingbourne, Kent. He was dressed up as a policeman, and carrying a shotgun. For three hours, he tried to persuade her to come back to him. When she refused, he shot her in the thigh.</p> <p>Bleeding, 49-year-old Whiting dialled 999. As she spoke to the emergency services, Carter, 48, shot her twice more in the legs before killing himself with a shot to the head. An ambulance arrived about nine minutes after Whiting made the call. The crew, however, were prevented by police from entering the house for an hour, during which time she pleaded for help down the phone, repeating again and again that the gunman was dead.</p> <p>By the time police and medics finally entered the house, she had bled to death. A Home Office pathologist told the subsequent inquest that had she been treated when the ambulance first got there, she would have had a 98% chance of survival.</p> <p>Since her death, her family - she has three children from a previous marriage - has been fighting to find out why police inaction allowed her to die. Now, with the help of Imran Khan and Michael Mansfield QC - the solicitor and barrister who represented the family of the murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence - they have launched a groundbreaking legal action against Kent police.</p> <p>Whiting's brother, Paul Jarrett, says: \"The police should have allowed the medics to enter the house when they were first told Carter was dead, which was a few minutes after the ambulance arrived.\"</p> <p>The family heard about Whiting's emergency call for the first time at the inquest. Her daughter, Catherine Elvin, explains: \"No one had told us she'd been on the phone. I didn't have a clue. As far as I was concerned, mum died when she got to hospital. That was all I knew.\"</p> <p>At the inquest, the family was given a transcript of Whiting's 61-minute phone conversation with the emergency services. This, together with the evidence given by the officers, left them appalled and convinced she could have survived.</p> <p>Jarrett says the police operation was full of muddle and contradiction. There was confusion over who was in charge - two officers apparently claimed to have been in command on the night. Crucially, no officers in command listened to Whiting's phone conversation or spoke to her. The constable who did speak to her some 20 minutes after she first made the emergency call responded by calling for his colleagues to go in straight away. He was overruled by more senior officers.</p> <p>The police insist that they were right to delay entry to the house because they had no way of confirming whether the gunman really was dead. They said: \"There was no way of determining if the situation Loraine Whiting described was accurate or someone had put a gun to her head.\"</p> <p>But the family dispute this. They say if the police were not aware Carter was dead, they should have been. Why did no officer senior enough to order entry to the house speak to Whiting?</p> <p>The police complaints authority investigated the incident and exonerated all of the officers involved. Of one of the officers whose behaviour the family criticise, it says that he \"denied that he failed ... to exercise effective leadership or action in respect of police response ... He said that he made the decision not to listen in to the call himself, so as to retain the freedom to respond effectively to other events as they arose.\"</p> <p>Jarrett says that rather than listening to Whiting, the officer was relying on incomplete information he was reading off a computer screen. Whiting was speaking to an operator at Kent ambulance headquarters; the operator relayed the information to the ambulance at the scene; the ambulance crew relayed it to the scene-of-crime officer; the scene-of-crime officer relayed it to the control centre at Swale; and Swale relayed it to police headquarters. Where it was put on to the computer system.</p> <p>Elvin is equally unimpressed. \"If mum had been a celebrity, they would have gone in there and come out heroes,\" she says.</p> <p>The transcript of the phone conversation makes harrowing reading. Whiting insists a total of 30 times that Carter is dead. She tells both the ambulance operator and the constable she spoke to how urgently she needs help: \"I've lost so much blood ... I'm just bleeding.\" And: \"I'm going. I've got no blood left in me.\"</p> <p>When asked where Carter shot himself, she replies: \"In the head.\"</p> <p>\"He's shot himself in the head?\"</p> <p>\"Yeah.\"</p> <p>Later the operator says: \"He is definitely dead?\"</p> <p>\"Yes - he's dead.\" Later: \"Just someone come in - he's dead. He put the gun in his mouth.\"</p> <p>So far, the family have had only the written transcript they obtained at the inquest to go on. The police originally refused to hand over the 999 tape, explaining that it was \"an extremely traumatic item to listen to\". They have now agreed to release it.</p> <p>According to the transcript, Whiting's screams as she is shot again are audible, as is Carter telling her: \"Kid, I'm going to kill myself.\" A series of bangs is then heard, followed by a silence of a few minutes. Whiting comes back on the line saying: \"I've been shot. He's shot himself. He's still in here. He's dead. He's shot himself.\" The family say this exchange makes a nonsense of police claims that they could not enter the house because they feared Whiting was speaking under duress and they were being lured into a trap.</p> <p>After hitting brick walls everywhere else, the family finally ended up at Khan's door. What first sparked his interest in the case, he says, was a piece of uncanny symmetry: while police officers from the Met were investigating the family's complaint about Kent police, the Met was, in turn, being investigated by Kent over another of Khan's cases: the Stephen Lawrence murder. Elvin recalls: \"Talking to Imran was like a breath of fresh air. It was like, hallelujah!\"</p> <p>The force is trying to get the case thrown out as an \"abuse of process\". It also argues that the case should not go ahead because it was launched outside the usual time limit for death and injury claims. In its defence, it says the police had to delay entry to the house until the arrival of a third armed response vehicle, with a crew experienced in firearms incidents.</p> <p>The police have also obtained a second Home Office pathologist's report which says that even if they had entered the house when the first ARV arrived, Whiting's injuries were such she would still have died. Jarrett dismisses this report as \"too convenient\".</p> <p>If it is allowed to go ahead, the case will break new legal ground. The police's long-standing blanket protection from being sued for negligence was recently overturned by the European court of human rights. In Osman v the United Kingdom, the court ruled that total immunity was a breach of human rights and that each negligence case should be decided on its merits. \"It must be established ... that the [police] knew or ought to have known at the time of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the life of an identified individual ... from the criminal acts of a third party and that they failed to take measures which were in the scope of their powers which, judged reasonably, might have been expected to avoid that risk,\" it said.</p> <p>Traditionally, actions to hold police accountable in this way were thrown out by judges. In 1989, the House of Lords rejected a claim by the mother of the Yorkshire ripper's last victim, Jacqueline Hill, who had tried to sue for negligence arguing that it was police incompetence in not catching the killer earlier which had led to her daughter's death.</p> <p>Whiting's family stress that going to court is very much a last resort. They feel they have no alternative but to fund an expensive and highly risky case in an untested area of law.</p> <p>Elvin says: \"All we ever wanted was an apology and an explanation. Nobody's perfect. Everyone makes mistakes. We accept that. We have been reduced to having to do this. We have been forced into this to find out the answers as to why mum died and why people couldn't make decisions and act quickly enough.\"</p>",

Whiting was speaking to an operator at Kent ambulance headquarters; the operator relayed the information to the ambulance at the scene; the ambulance crew relayed it to the scene-of-crime officer; the scene-of-crime officer relayed it to the control centre at Swale; and Swale relayed it to police headquarters. Where it was put on to the computer system. Elvin is equally unimpressed. \"If mum had been a celebrity, they would have gone in there and come out heroes,\" she says. The transcript of the phone conversation makes harrowing reading. Whiting insists a total of 30 times that Carter is dead. She tells both the ambulance operator and the constable she spoke to how urgently she needs help: \"I've lost so much blood ... I'm just bleeding.\" And: \"I'm going. I've got no blood left in me.\" When asked where Carter shot himself, she replies: \"In the head.\" \"He's shot himself in the head?\" \"Yeah.\" Later the operator says: \"He is definitely dead?\" \"Yes - he's dead.\" Later: \"Just someone come in - he's dead. He put the gun in his mouth.\" So far, the family have had only the written transcript they obtained at the inquest to go on. The police originally refused to hand over the 999 tape, explaining that it was \"an extremely traumatic item to listen to\". They have now agreed to release it. According to the transcript, Whiting's screams as she is shot again are audible, as is Carter telling her: \"Kid, I'm going to kill myself.\" A series of bangs is then heard, followed by a silence of a few minutes. Whiting comes back on the line saying: \"I've been shot. He's shot himself. He's still in here. He's dead. He's shot himself.\" The family say this exchange makes a nonsense of police claims that they could not enter the house because they feared Whiting was speaking under duress and they were being lured into a trap. After hitting brick walls everywhere else, the family finally ended up at Khan's door. What first sparked his interest in the case, he says, was a piece of uncanny symmetry: while police officers from the Met were investigating the family's complaint about Kent police, the Met was, in turn, being investigated by Kent over another of Khan's cases: the Stephen Lawrence murder. Elvin recalls: \"Talking to Imran was like a breath of fresh air. It was like, hallelujah!\" The force is trying to get the case thrown out as an \"abuse of process\". It also argues that the case should not go ahead because it was launched outside the usual time limit for death and injury claims. In its defence, it says the police had to delay entry to the house until the arrival of a third armed response vehicle, with a crew experienced in firearms incidents. The police have also obtained a second Home Office pathologist's report which says that even if they had entered the house when the first ARV arrived, Whiting's injuries were such she would still have died. Jarrett dismisses this report as \"too convenient\". If it is allowed to go ahead, the case will break new legal ground. The police's long-standing blanket protection from being sued for negligence was recently overturned by the European court of human rights. In Osman v the United Kingdom, the court ruled that total immunity was a breach of human rights and that each negligence case should be decided on its merits. \"It must be established ... that the [police] knew or ought to have known at the time of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the life of an identified individual ... from the criminal acts of a third party and that they failed to take measures which were in the scope of their powers which, judged reasonably, might have been expected to avoid that risk,\" it said. Traditionally, actions to hold police accountable in this way were thrown out by judges. In 1989, the House of Lords rejected a claim by the mother of the Yorkshire ripper's last victim, Jacqueline Hill, who had tried to sue for negligence arguing that it was police incompetence in not catching the killer earlier which had led to her daughter's death. Whiting's family stress that going to court is very much a last resort. They feel they have no alternative but to fund an expensive and highly risky case in an untested area of law. Elvin says: \"All we ever wanted was an apology and an explanation. Nobody's perfect. Everyone makes mistakes. We accept that. We have been reduced to having to do this. We have been forced into this to find out the answers as to why mum died and why people couldn't make decisions and act quickly enough.\"",

      "byline": "Mark Fletcher-Brown",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Directly elected mayors could be about to sweep the country. Birmingham, Lewisham and Watford are poised for referendums on the idea, and campaigns are starting up in a number of other towns and cities. </p> <p>Many councillors, however, are set dead against the idea. They argue that the mayoral model concentrates too much power in one person's hands and that changes in political structures will not offer a magic solution to local problems, no matter what the government says.</p> <p>Some councillors are choosing to keep their heads down and not talk about mayors, but voters can circumvent their local authority and force a referendum if they collect just 5% of the local electorate's signatures.</p> <p>Instead, local politicians have to win the public relations battle against the new model. Here are ten ways to make sure the mayoral issue isn't an issue for your council:</p> <p><strong>One: we're delivering anyway</strong></p> <p>Forget the big strategic agenda here. If you want to sell the benefits of the services you deliver you've got to find the bits that are most noticed by your audience and highlight those. Bins may not seem sexy, but if you are able to ensure that you pick up rubbish bags and litter then you'll get more accolades than by opening yet another Mandela Centre in your town. Think about education, too. Many councils spend above the government's recommended amount for schools.</p> <p><strong>Two: we're listening</strong></p> <p>Councils are listening. Consultation is spreading across local government like a rash. But listening only looks like listening when you signal that you've heard. Feedback to your local residents. Let them know that you've heard them. Tell them the difference that their contribution has made. Or tell them it hasn't.</p> <p><strong>Three: remember the little things</strong></p> <p>We're all acutely aware of the microscopic details of day to day life. It's often these that tell us whether we're being treated well, or getting good value for money. For example, you may go out for dinner, spending a small fortune, and be served cheap coffee at the end of the meal. That one detail could well put you off the whole thing. It's a detail but it matters. Look at your council from a detailed point of view. What are the things that people worry about? Do you keep people hanging on the phone? Do you treat people well at receptions? Do you make an extra effort to be friendly?</p> <p><strong>Four: be accountable</strong></p> <p>The mayor is attractive because there will be a name - someone you can look to; someone you can blame. It's shorthand for personal responsibility. There's nothing more annoying than having to deal with some town hall jobsworth who won't even wear a name badge. Ensure that all of your staff, particularly front line staff, are named and willing to be accountable for their actions.</p> <p><strong>Five: be consistent</strong></p> <p>Another thing that drives people up the wall, and makes good copy for the local rag, is appearing inconsistent. Councillors could be simultaneously upping their allowances and cutting the funding to a community group. Now the fact is that they're dealt with in different parts of the building - and it was probably an external body that said councillors should be paid more anyway - but it quickly looks like inconsistency. It's a source of grief and resentment and likely to precipitate a demand for someone to go in and sort it out. Enter the mayor.</p> <p><strong>Six: be human</strong></p> <p>Look to Chinese/American relationships at the moment. The pressure's on for someone to say \"sorry\". For some reason, probably insurance staff and lawyers, public bodies struggle to mouth the word. And so they will either say nothing or something that sounds like a cop out. It makes the organisation seem impersonal. And again, the mayor could be the very person to go in and make them behave like human beings.</p> <p><strong>Seven: admit mistakes</strong></p> <p>Common sense tells us that we cannot be right all of the time. So naturally, when people in any organisation fail to admit to errors we either believe that they are lying or that they are simply hiding the truth. Either way it's not healthy. Of course, you can admit you are wrong in a way that enhances your credibility. It's another part of being a personal, people-driven bureaucracy.</p> <p><strong>Eight: pass on the credit</strong></p> <p>We have a culture that abhors the me-first, self-driven approach. And when councils push out endless pictures of members and officers smiling and taking the credit for something they've done it can simply reinforce the perception that they think they are more important than the community. Push your customers first. Bask only in reflected glory. Appear demure and self-effacing. It's what makes Britain Britain.</p> <p><strong>Nine: share the problem</strong></p> <p>Don't allow others to believe that you have all of the answers. You don't. Nobody does. But if you work with local people and admit that you will help them to feel that they are creating the solution. You get lots of ideas. They get what they want. And they appreciate subliminally that life is a lot more complex than the debate on elected mayors would have them believe.</p> <p><strong>Ten: keep it on the ground</strong></p> <p>Don't spend your public life talking about strategies, especially strategies that sprawl over a 20-year period.

      "bodyText": "Directly elected mayors could be about to sweep the country. Birmingham, Lewisham and Watford are poised for referendums on the idea, and campaigns are starting up in a number of other towns and cities. Many councillors, however, are set dead against the idea. They argue that the mayoral model concentrates too much power in one person's hands and that changes in political structures will not offer a magic solution to local problems, no matter what the government says. Some councillors are choosing to keep their heads down and not talk about mayors, but voters can circumvent their local authority and force a referendum if they collect just 5% of the local electorate's signatures. Instead, local politicians have to win the public relations battle against the new model. Here are ten ways to make sure the mayoral issue isn't an issue for your council: One: we're delivering anyway Forget the big strategic agenda here. If you want to sell the benefits of the services you deliver you've got to find the bits that are most noticed by your audience and highlight those. Bins may not seem sexy, but if you are able to ensure that you pick up rubbish bags and litter then you'll get more accolades than by opening yet another Mandela Centre in your town. Think about education, too. Many councils spend above the government's recommended amount for schools. Two: we're listening Councils are listening. Consultation is spreading across local government like a rash. But listening only looks like listening when you signal that you've heard. Feedback to your local residents. Let them know that you've heard them. Tell them the difference that their contribution has made. Or tell them it hasn't. Three: remember the little things We're all acutely aware of the microscopic details of day to day life. It's often these that tell us whether we're being treated well, or getting good value for money. For example, you may go out for dinner, spending a small fortune, and be served cheap coffee at the end of the meal. That one detail could well put you off the whole thing. It's a detail but it matters. Look at your council from a detailed point of view. What are the things that people worry about? Do you keep people hanging on the phone? Do you treat people well at receptions? Do you make an extra effort to be friendly? Four: be accountable The mayor is attractive because there will be a name - someone you can look to; someone you can blame. It's shorthand for personal responsibility. There's nothing more annoying than having to deal with some town hall jobsworth who won't even wear a name badge. Ensure that all of your staff, particularly front line staff, are named and willing to be accountable for their actions. Five: be consistent Another thing that drives people up the wall, and makes good copy for the local rag, is appearing inconsistent. Councillors could be simultaneously upping their allowances and cutting the funding to a community group. Now the fact is that they're dealt with in different parts of the building - and it was probably an external body that said councillors should be paid more anyway - but it quickly looks like inconsistency. It's a source of grief and resentment and likely to precipitate a demand for someone to go in and sort it out. Enter the mayor. Six: be human Look to Chinese/American relationships at the moment. The pressure's on for someone to say \"sorry\". For some reason, probably insurance staff and lawyers, public bodies struggle to mouth the word. And so they will either say nothing or something that sounds like a cop out. It makes the organisation seem impersonal. And again, the mayor could be the very person to go in and make them behave like human beings. Seven: admit mistakes Common sense tells us that we cannot be right all of the time. So naturally, when people in any organisation fail to admit to errors we either believe that they are lying or that they are simply hiding the truth. Either way it's not healthy. Of course, you can admit you are wrong in a way that enhances your credibility. It's another part of being a personal, people-driven bureaucracy. Eight: pass on the credit We have a culture that abhors the me-first, self-driven approach. And when councils push out endless pictures of members and officers smiling and taking the credit for something they've done it can simply reinforce the perception that they think they are more important than the community. Push your customers first. Bask only in reflected glory. Appear demure and self-effacing. It's what makes Britain Britain. Nine: share the problem Don't allow others to believe that you have all of the answers. You don't. Nobody does. But if you work with local people and admit that you will help them to feel that they are creating the solution. You get lots of ideas. They get what they want. And they appreciate subliminally that life is a lot more complex than the debate on elected mayors would have them believe. Ten: keep it on the ground Don't spend your public life talking about strategies, especially strategies that sprawl over a 20-year period. It's too big a picture. Stick to the real things that make immediate, tangible differences to the daily lives of the people who pick up the bill. \u0095 Mark Fletcher-Brown works for the communications consultancy Reputation",
