Coversure, despite its claim to compare several different policies, was the worst with \u00a3766 and a \u00a3500 excess. Screentrade, which made a similar claim, was also very disappointing, offering me a Norwich Union policy for more than \u00a3200 more than it would have cost me to buy it direct.</p> <p>However, insurance is a very buoyant market and the fact that a particular company is best for one motorist does not mean that it will be best for everybody. Just how buoyant it is, I discovered before I went to buy the Eagle Star policy the next day. On a hunch I asked for a new quote and fed in identical information. The figure it offered came down from \u00a3459 to \u00a3413.</p> <p>After buying insurance at that figure, I repeated the exercise to find it had gone up to \u00a3446. If I had had time to go through all the sites every day for a week, I am sure that one of the quotes would have eventually gone down to an even lower figure.</p> <p><strong> </strong> In our article on Euro 2000 bets on page 17 in last week's issue, the websites which bypass conventional bookmakers should have read <a href=\"http://www.betfair.com\">www.betfair.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.flutter.com,\">www.flutter.com,</a> not &lt;A HREF=\"http://www.playfair.com.\"</p> <p> \" TARGET=\"_NEW\"&gt;www.playfair.com. </p>",

One anomaly I discovered from this - which was confirmed by other companies - is that the quote is actually reduced if the owner's spouse is added to the policy. Generally speaking, online quotes seemed to be about 15% less than the same companies charged on the phone, though the Norwich Union wanted \u00a334 more on its site. After getting quotes from nine sites I found Eagle Star's \u00a3459 with a \u00a3200 excess was the cheapest. Coversure, despite its claim to compare several different policies, was the worst with \u00a3766 and a \u00a3500 excess. Screentrade, which made a similar claim, was also very disappointing, offering me a Norwich Union policy for more than \u00a3200 more than it would have cost me to buy it direct. However, insurance is a very buoyant market and the fact that a particular company is best for one motorist does not mean that it will be best for everybody. Just how buoyant it is, I discovered before I went to buy the Eagle Star policy the next day. On a hunch I asked for a new quote and fed in identical information. The figure it offered came down from \u00a3459 to \u00a3413. After buying insurance at that figure, I repeated the exercise to find it had gone up to \u00a3446. If I had had time to go through all the sites every day for a week, I am sure that one of the quotes would have eventually gone down to an even lower figure. In our article on Euro 2000 bets on page 17 in last week's issue, the websites which bypass conventional bookmakers should have read www.betfair.com and www.flutter.com, not \n<a>www.playfair.com.</a>",

Growing numbers of would-be first-time buyers have been priced out of the market, and so are having to continue renting. </p> <p>At the same time, the strong property price growth has prompted some landlords to abandon the rental market and put their properties up for sale. Added to this, interest rates now appear to have stabilised, and some economists reckon the next move could be down, which of course means lower mortgage costs for property owners. </p> <p>\"The increasing costs of becoming a homeowner are stoking demand for rental property.

All these factors are likely to result in demand for rental property continuing to grow, thereby pushing up rents, he says. </p> <p>A survey from buy-to-let home loans specialist Paragon Mortgages which involved 665 landlords, both amateur and professional, painted a picture of a sector enjoying rude health. It found that the average landlord is enjoying a gross yield of 11.7%, though the return after running costs have been taken into account is 6.7%. </p> <p>The findings also suggest that the reported over-supply of properties may be some what exaggerated. It found that 92% of properties were let and the average \"void\" period - the amount of time a property is empty - was 27 days per year. Generally speaking, the advice to buy-to-let investors is to allow for one to two months a year of voids. </p> <p>The latest yield figures for greater London from Ludlowthompson are less bullish, but they reveal that of all the different types of home, ex-local authority properties are delivering the best returns - an average of around 11% compared with 9.7% for three-bedroom properties, 9.1% for two-bedroom properties and 9% for one-bedroom properties. </p> <p>This partly reflects the fact that there are former council properties in highly desirable areas such as Islington and Battersea. </p> <p>Mortgage broker John Charcol says that while the buy-to-let mortgage market \"is certainly not as frothy as it was last year\", partly as a result of rental yields having dipped a little, there are still some competitive home loan deals aimed at would-be landlords. </p> <p>Cheshire Building Society is offering a redemption penalty-free deal giving a 1% discount for one year, which means a current payment rate of 6.49%.

They have to do their maths. Don't go into it thinking it is going to be a quick buck - it's a long-term investment\". </p> <p>She advises people to make sure the property is marketable - that means well-positioned when it comes to stations and shops, for example. And talk to estate agents to get an idea of what the expected rental yields are. </p> <p>Going flat out for the future</p> <p>Jane Smith became a landlord three years ago and was lucky enough to buy in an area that, outside London, has seen some of the biggest price rises in the country. </p> <p>She has three properties in Brighton, centrally-located flats, and is buying a fourth. For her and her husband, this wasn't about making a quick buck. As she puts it: \"This is our pension. That's why we went into this in the first place. It wasn't because we wanted to become private landlords.\" </p> <p>Their plan, she says, was to buy one property a year for the next few years in order to achieve a decent income for retirement. All three properties are mortgaged on 15-year loans and occupied by tenants.

      "byline": "Keith Watson",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Stumbling in on a performance by French dance company Montalvo-Hervieu, you could be forgiven for thinking you are under the influence of some very strong psychedelic drug. Humans turn into flamingos, a flamenco trio segues into Queen's We Will Rock You. The effect is like channel surfing through 100 TV stations, each showing a different style of dance. </p> <p>Breakdance collides with ballet in a scratch-edit of movement that makes the unlikeliest of connections seem plausible: maybe Vivaldi was a hip hop renegade master after all. That may sound gimmicky, and Montalvo-Hervieu's style is unashamedly crowd-pleasing; indeed, the accessible, engaging troupe has become one of France's most successful exports. But there is a method in the madness of the company's latest work, Le Jardin Io Io Ito Ito. It is a \"happy eulogy to cosmopolitanism,\" according to choreographer Jos\u00e9 Montalvo, a man much given to lyrical flights of fancy about his work and inspired by the dance festivals of his childhood. \"An amazing multi-colour tribe participated. At night, in the heart of drunkenness and the hide-and-seek of desire, the dancing and singing transformed everyone. Each individual became virtuosos for one moment.\" </p> <p>Taking that as his starting point, Montalvo has assembled a line-up of 18 performers who are all expert in their varied fields. His trick is to throw acrobats and baroque stylists on stage together and exploit the flying sparks. It could turn out an unholy mess. But such is the company's exuberance that Montalvo succeeds in rolling back the years using dance as a metaphor for the innocence of youth. Most remarkable are the connections between apparently disparate forms. Using the kind of call-and-response interplay more readily associated with old soul records, dancers from contrasting styles bounce moves off each other as proof that dance is an international language. </p> <p>Le Jardin Io Io Ito Ito's title is drawn from the curious collages of surrealist master Max Ernst, and his sense of deranged imagery is at play in the film sequences that are intercut with the dancers.

      "bodyText": "Stumbling in on a performance by French dance company Montalvo-Hervieu, you could be forgiven for thinking you are under the influence of some very strong psychedelic drug. Humans turn into flamingos, a flamenco trio segues into Queen's We Will Rock You. The effect is like channel surfing through 100 TV stations, each showing a different style of dance. Breakdance collides with ballet in a scratch-edit of movement that makes the unlikeliest of connections seem plausible: maybe Vivaldi was a hip hop renegade master after all. That may sound gimmicky, and Montalvo-Hervieu's style is unashamedly crowd-pleasing; indeed, the accessible, engaging troupe has become one of France's most successful exports. But there is a method in the madness of the company's latest work, Le Jardin Io Io Ito Ito. It is a \"happy eulogy to cosmopolitanism,\" according to choreographer Jos\u00e9 Montalvo, a man much given to lyrical flights of fancy about his work and inspired by the dance festivals of his childhood. \"An amazing multi-colour tribe participated. At night, in the heart of drunkenness and the hide-and-seek of desire, the dancing and singing transformed everyone. Each individual became virtuosos for one moment.\" Taking that as his starting point, Montalvo has assembled a line-up of 18 performers who are all expert in their varied fields. His trick is to throw acrobats and baroque stylists on stage together and exploit the flying sparks. It could turn out an unholy mess. But such is the company's exuberance that Montalvo succeeds in rolling back the years using dance as a metaphor for the innocence of youth. Most remarkable are the connections between apparently disparate forms. Using the kind of call-and-response interplay more readily associated with old soul records, dancers from contrasting styles bounce moves off each other as proof that dance is an international language. Le Jardin Io Io Ito Ito's title is drawn from the curious collages of surrealist master Max Ernst, and his sense of deranged imagery is at play in the film sequences that are intercut with the dancers. Animals on screen compete in a curious posing contest with their human partners; balancing acts combine live and filmed performers. The result is a skewed take on the world that can throw in Wiseguys dance anthem Ooh La La La, US wrestling star Scotty Too Kool Taylor's trademark \"worm\" move (or maybe I was just seeing things) and a breakdancing Christmas tree, without pausing for breath. As Montalvo puts it: \"It's a poetry of juxtaposition at the service of movement, desire, fantasy, dreams and childhood.\" \u0095 Le Jardin Io Io Ito Ito is at the Barbican, London EC2 (020-7638 8891), tonight.",

The prizes include economies of scale, the ability to exploit brands, technology and market share. But what is a truly pan-european company? Manchester Business School and management consultant Collinson Grant are collaborating in a review of how companies in Europe are structured and managed. The programme will seek views from more than 900 of the largest businesses using a postal survey and face-to-face interviews. The results will help determine the defining features of an integrated European business. Collinson Grant has published a preliminary overview of how the current developments in the markets, preferences of consumers, advances in technology and the impact of the euro are driving change in European businesses.

      "bodyText": "Birkbeck College, University of London, is hosting a one-day workshop headed UK.Com, Prospects and Policies for the New Economy, on July 4. Sessions include Building the Knowledge-Driven Economy, e-commerce @ work and what's new about the new economy. The opportunities that the internet, digital TV and third-generation mobile phones can offer have been researched by the Retail e-commerce Task Force. Its report, published by the Department of Trade and Industry, will be presented by Task Force chairman Chris Townsend. And the Co-Operative Party is launching its study of \"e-mutualism or the tragedy of the dot.commons\". Booking details from conference organiser Steve Warby, tel: 020-7631-6743. There are serious profits to be made through building a successful transnational pan-European business modelled on US or Japanese multinationals. The prizes include economies of scale, the ability to exploit brands, technology and market share. But what is a truly pan-european company? Manchester Business School and management consultant Collinson Grant are collaborating in a review of how companies in Europe are structured and managed. The programme will seek views from more than 900 of the largest businesses using a postal survey and face-to-face interviews. The results will help determine the defining features of an integrated European business. Collinson Grant has published a preliminary overview of how the current developments in the markets, preferences of consumers, advances in technology and the impact of the euro are driving change in European businesses. For a free copy of the initial report Building Pan-European Businesses call Jennifer Whittle at Collinson Grant, tel: 0161-793-9028. Ever wondered what it would be like to take a simulated helicopter flight to a North Sea oil rig, build a website, programme a robot, or design stained glass? You can do all this and more at The Skills Show between July 5-9, at the NEC Birmingham. The show encourages young people to see a variety of trades in action from fish frying, plumbing, and hairdressing to robotics. Tickets \u00a36 from the NEC box office, tel: 0121-780-4133.",

Then it's presentation time: a few words, the jokes, and the leaving party. You're on your way: pastures new; onwards and upwards. You'll never look back. </p> <p>But your old boss might. The booming jobs market is encouraging employers into offering lucrative deals to lure back workers who may have left only months before. </p> <p>\"It's becoming increasingly common, particularly in a tight labour market. Employers are welcoming people back with open arms,\" says Imogen Daniels, an adviser for the Institute of Personnel and Development. There's even a new term for them: \"boomerang\" employees. They are the people who leave an organisation, maybe to go to a competitor, then realise that it's not quite what they'd hoped for. </p> <p>Six months or a year later, either they ask if there's anything going at their old place or their original employer asks them to come back, sometimes offering a hard-to-turn-down incentive: a giddy combination of more responsibility, more respect, more excitement and more money. </p> <p>\"In the past, employers were concerned with loyalty. There was a long marriage between employers and employees. Today, things are more fluid,\" says Ms Daniels. \"But when interviewing boomerang employees, it's important to find out why they left. Yet when they do come back, they may be more loyal. Their networks may still be active. They can slot back in.\" </p> <p>But not all employers or recruitment agents agree. Jo Ousten of Jo Ousten &amp; Co, who has spent 18 years helping people to find career paths that feel right for them, says: \"As an employer, I would never take somebody back. People can come back with baggage. </p> <p>\"There are subtle negatives to the idea. You might want to come back to something you know - but it's not what you know, it's moved on.\" Some companies have a policy of not re-employing, explains Ms Ousten, for the reason that there are too many imponderables. </p> <p>She makes the distinction between a job and a career: if someone goes back to a former employer to do a specific task, there may be huge advantages. If it's a management position, she believes the person may be stuck in the past. </p> <p>Yet people do it. \"We see it happening more now than before,\" says Georgina Stewart, marketing director at Freshfields, a London law firm. One such \"boomerang\" is Geoff Peters, associate at Freshfields. After qualifying at Freshfields and spending three years there, he went to work \"in-house\" at Shell. He lasted only six months. He then went to a smaller law firm for another six months. How did people react when he walked back in? </p> <p>\"People were curious to find out what it's like out there,\" he says. \"It brings home to people the fact that perhaps the grass isn't always greener.\" </p> <p>And if you do come back, won't your former colleagues want to know what went wrong? According to Dr Rob Briner, senior lecturer in organisational psychology in Birkbeck College, it depends on the way you tell it. \"Careers are just stories that people tell each other, linked together in a way that makes sense to them.\" </p> <p>And it depends very much on the industry, and the level of gossip. \"In academia, if you screw up, everybody would know,\" he says. </p> <p>Yet whatever your story, believes Dr Briner, it won't ever top the one your employer will tell. \"Look, people love it here - they can't stay away!\" </p> <p>But why go back? If it doesn't work out in the new place, so what? You've already made one move, why not two? Or is going back a way of getting what you wanted in the first place? </p> <p>\"The 80s trend for de-layering has increased the incentive to leave a company, go to another and come back in a higher position,\" explains Richard Reeves, director of futures at the Industrial Society. \"In organisations today, the traditional ladder has been taken away. You can feel stuck. The only way to go up is to get out and come back.\" </p> <p>For when it comes to money, leaving an organisation is a sure-fire way of being offered more. \"It's ironic, but your stock with a company goes up the day you leave,\" says Mr Reeves. </p> <p>Not surprisingly, given that many people spend more time at work than with their partners, the relationship parallels are obvious. If you're head-hunted, or if you accept another job, your current employer might suddenly shower you with riches and wild promises to encourage you to stay. </p> <p>Just as, if someone suddenly starts showing an interest in your partner, you're less inclined to slump in front of the television and more likely to reach for the cookery books and rustle up a light aphrodisiac. </p> <p>Knowledge, particularly if gained in a competitor's lair, is also something that can make \"boomerangs\" extremely attractive to former employers. An insight into how an arch-rival approaches a new business pitch can be worth wooing. </p> <p>Yet it's not always the case. \"The knowledge you've taken away in the first place might have been so valuable that the company might feel betrayed,\" says Dr Briner. \"What is more, people can think: 'Hold on, if you're telling us about someone else, what did you tell them about us?' \" he adds. </p> <p>And if you pursue the analogy of lovers reunited after a taste of what else is out there, new skills learned in another camp are definitely best kept to yourself. For Rachel, a lawyer, it's clear cut: \"Jobs are like relationships: never go back.\" </p> <p><strong>They call me the prodigal son</strong></p> <p> John Parkin worked at advertising agency HHCL &amp; Partners for two years, then left to go to Partners BDDH. After six months, he returned to HHCL and has been there for two years - he is now a creative director. </p> <p>\"I've been called the prodigal son for two years. I think that when you're working somewhere good, you can start taking some of the good things for granted. You need a break sometimes. When you start at a new place, there's a buzz. You're meeting new people and your learning curve is steep. </p> <p>\"When I first went to Partners BDDH I enjoyed it a lot but then I started missing certain things. At HHCL we work in teams differently; it's very collaborative. Going somewhere else made me see this place very clearly. </p> <p>\"If it doesn't work out in a new place and you suddenly look at the old place through rose-tinted glasses, that's not the way to do it. I think that if the things that make you leave are things that are fundamentally wrong with a company, forgetting about them and then going back is something you do at your peril. I suppose the danger is that you fall back into the same responses and attitudes. I've been very conscious of not doing that. </p> <p>\"When anyone leaves HHCL, you have what's known as an 'exit chat'. I had mine quite late; I'd already started working at the other agency. They asked me: 'What could we have done and what could we do in the future?' One of the things I asked for was to come back on a four-day week. </p> <p>\"You get all that stuff about 'you can't do that; you can't go backwards'. I was very aware of it. But if you do it with integrity and you think you can grow, you shouldn't worry too much about what other people think. On balance, you've got to do what's best for you. For me, it was right to come back.\" </p> <p><strong>It was like a school reunion</strong></p> <p> Kate Valentine went back to her former employer - a communications consultancy - after having left five years before to work in another consultancy. \"I was flattered to be asked back. It was to do a job that promised much greater scope than the one I had been doing before. </p> <p>\"But when I went back, they still saw me as the same person. It felt like regressing. Going back to a company is the wrong thing to do, even if it is in a very senior position. All the things you loved about a company aren't there any more and the things you didn't like are still there: they seem worse. When you start a new job you need enthusiasm and freshness. If you go back, you don't have that. </p> <p>\"As soon as you step through the door, it all comes flooding back: the politics, even the smell of the office. People come up to you and say 'do you remember that conference we went to?' It's a bit like a school reunion. It sends shivers down your spine. </p> <p>\"But I don't regret going back.

In the life of all fans there comes a point when they start to believe that dancers don't (and can't) perform the way they used to. This is a position of infuriating smugness to others. Young dancers rage at being judged by the ghosts of the past, while novice dance-goers are made to feel they are seeing only a dim echo of what was granted their elders. </p> <p>The Kirov, as the world's greatest living ballet museum, inspires this generational oneupmanship all the time. When the company visited Britain in 1988 after 18 years' absence, older fans were quick to compare it with remembered glory days. Now those of us who became besotted with the company 12 years ago are showing our age by fretting over certain changes, especially among the company's youngest ballerinas. </p> <p>The 24-year-old Diana Vishneva, for instance, is a dancer of exhilarating speed and attack who has developed a style that looks far more international than previous generations. Her power and personality illuminate comedy ballets such as Don Quixote and the 20th-century repertory (she has been outstanding this season in Balanchine's Rubies), but in the more classical context of Sleeping Beauty her qualities can jar, especially when compared with the very traditional Aurora danced by Zhanna Ayupova. At 33, Ayupova is one of the few remaining principals trained in what has become old-school Kirov. </p> <p>This is a style more sculptural than linear, in which movements are embellished by a contrapuntal activity of head, eyes, shoulders and hands. Its beauties can be breathtakingly flukey, because they combine so many nuances of style and expression. It is also highly sociable, because each move connects spatially and dramatically to everything else on stage. When Ayupova dances, the focus of her gestures and her glance is always directed outside her: she isn't isolated within her own technical prowess. </p> <p>By contrast, Uliana Lopatkina, 26, is a one-woman phenomenon whose boneless fluency and eerily extended line have become the ideal of her generation. Lopatkina moves as if her body were tuned by a far more sophisticated technology than the rest of us. But her exquisitely long lines are achieved at a cost. She is a dancer who is all limbs and feet, and her torso, which should be a radiant and responsive focus of energy, is a blank. There are dramatic and musical dead points in her style as a consequence. So while her Nikiya in Monday's Bayad\u00e8re was a marvel of supple control, it felt monochrome compared with performances I remember from Altynai Asylmuratova (who dances the role tonight). At 39, Asylmuratova may be in decline as far as technique goes, but she can still work the musical and dramatic alchemy by which familiar, even hokey, classical roles are made profound. </p> <p>A new ballerina coming through the ranks is 21-year-old Veronika Part, who closely resembles Lopatkina in the near-frictionless action of her legs and arms (although she lacks the absolute control that produces Lopatkina's peculiar grace). In Sleeping Beauty, Part has been a Lilac Fairy of some charm, but as Odette/Odile she moves in an introverted trance. This new breed of superballerinas have honed and glossed their techniques to awesome extremes, but at the expense of personality and imagination. </p> <p>This season has given fewer opportunities to the Kirov's men - most of them have gone to Igor Zelensky, a freelance who returns to the Kirov, his home company, whenever his schedule allows. Zelensky started the season looking jetlagged and distracted, and when he danced Swan Lake with Part their pas de deux looked under-rehearsed. On Monday though, as Solor to Lopatkina's Nikiya, he was dancing as well as I've seen him. The humming power of his pirouettes and the arrowy length of his jumps were imposing in themselves, but they also sang with the music. </p> <p>Among the soloists, standards have looked uneven. The best are still beautiful enough to make other companies weep but there's a tendency among the less gifted to force their effects so that their dancing looks choppy. The corps de ballet, though, remain the Kirov's treasure. Physically they look as if they've all come off the same assembly line (barely a deviant calf muscle in sight), yet the unison with which they move is not blindly drilled but a harmony of style and tradition. The other enduring treat is the Kirov's mime artist, Vladimir Ponomarev, performing a sublimely testy King Florestan, a madly infatuated priest and a rampant Shah. With his Rasputin glare and his baroque gift for melodrama, it is impossible to imagine the Kirov's 19th-century repertory without him. </p> <p>\u0095 The Kirov is at the Royal Opera House, London WC2 (020-7304 4000), till June 27 and returns from July 31 to August 19.</p>",

This new breed of superballerinas have honed and glossed their techniques to awesome extremes, but at the expense of personality and imagination. This season has given fewer opportunities to the Kirov's men - most of them have gone to Igor Zelensky, a freelance who returns to the Kirov, his home company, whenever his schedule allows. Zelensky started the season looking jetlagged and distracted, and when he danced Swan Lake with Part their pas de deux looked under-rehearsed. On Monday though, as Solor to Lopatkina's Nikiya, he was dancing as well as I've seen him. The humming power of his pirouettes and the arrowy length of his jumps were imposing in themselves, but they also sang with the music. Among the soloists, standards have looked uneven. The best are still beautiful enough to make other companies weep but there's a tendency among the less gifted to force their effects so that their dancing looks choppy. The corps de ballet, though, remain the Kirov's treasure. Physically they look as if they've all come off the same assembly line (barely a deviant calf muscle in sight), yet the unison with which they move is not blindly drilled but a harmony of style and tradition. The other enduring treat is the Kirov's mime artist, Vladimir Ponomarev, performing a sublimely testy King Florestan, a madly infatuated priest and a rampant Shah. With his Rasputin glare and his baroque gift for melodrama, it is impossible to imagine the Kirov's 19th-century repertory without him. \u0095 The Kirov is at the Royal Opera House, London WC2 (020-7304 4000), till June 27 and returns from July 31 to August 19.",

The downside of this deal is that only funds offered by Fidelity, Gartmore, Invesco, M&amp;G, Norwich Union and Family Assurance have agreed to drop the initial charge and only their funds can be bought through the site. So if you had your heart set on a fund from a different provider, this one's not for you. </p> <p>Virgin says the average initial charge levied by the providers on its site is 3.92% for Isas and 4.04% for unit trusts, so a customer investing \u00a37,000 in an Isa which grows by 7% a year would save more than \u00a3500 over 10 years. </p> <p>Customers are also being promised cheap online sharedealing through the website's association with Sharepeople. </p> <p>With no annual account charges and a flat fee of \u00a314.95 per deal regardless of the size of the transaction, Virgin claims the deal is one of the best on the market. </p> <p>It certainly seems better than this week's online sharedealing launch from Abbey National. With a commission structure of \u00a316 for deals up to \u00a31,000, \u00a325 for deals up to \u00a32,500 and \u00a339.50 for those of more than \u00a32,500, Abbey National's offer is significantly more expensive than many others. </p> <p>But frequent traders might be better off going to <a href=\"http://www.idealing.com\">www.idealing.com</a>. This charges an annual fee of \u00a320 but thereafter individual trades only cost \u00a310.

In addition, the site's background information on how to sort out your finances is pitched at three different levels of financial understanding, promising, amongst other things, an easy to understand beginner's guide to investing. </p> <p>Also ripe for the picking are mortgages from Alliance &amp; Leicester, Bank of Scotland, Bristol &amp; West, the Woolwich, Virgin One and the Lambeth, Skipton and West Bromwich building societies. </p> <p>The mortgages are not subject to any special discounts, but Virgin promises that they have been vetted to fit in with its standards of customer service and transparency. </p> <p>Virgin says it will add other types of financial products as well as schemes from a wider range of providers as and when it finds them suitable. In the immediate future, however, customers can look forward to the launch of a chatroom on the site. </p> <p>The Virgin launch is hot on the heals of Financial Services Authority chairman Howard Davies saying online companies are seriously underestimating demand. Egg and Cahoot are cited as two of the culprits. Only time will tell if Virgin falls into the same trap. </p> <p><strong>Free info service for UK savers</strong></p> <p>\u0095 Investors wanting professional information free can now click on to <a href=\"http://www.comdirect.co.uk\">www.comdirect.co.uk</a>. And it is cross-referenced, making it easy to move from prices to news to historical data and dealing. Comdirect is the UK arm of successful German stockbroking operation of the same name. It charges \u00a312.50 for trades under \u00a35,000, \u00a314.50 above. There is a \u00a325 a year fee so the more you deal, the lower the cost. Buying and selling the new index-tracking iShares is free within a self-select Isa. </p> <p>\u0095 Interactive Investor International has opened a funds supermarket at <a href=\"http://www.iii.co.uk/fundsnow\">www.iii.co.uk/fundsnow</a> with access to 20 fund managers and over 300 funds. Currently, customers will have to download application forms but iii is promising \"straight through processing to providers\" later this year. </p> <p>\u0095 Newcastle Building Society has come up with NewcastleNet Savings, which claims to beat all rivals on \u00a310,000-plus accounts with a 7.1% rate. But at the minimum \u00a35,000, the account is out-gunned by rivals such as Bristol &amp; West, first-e and Nationwide e-savings. </p> <p>\u0095 Legal &amp; General is going into business with website totallyjewish.com. The initial deal will provide brochureware information on the insurer's protection and investment products. Later this year, customers will be able to access policies and unit trusts online. </p> <p>\u0095 Hire vehicle group Holiday Cars Direct has revamped its website to give online quotes and a \u00a35 discount on online bookings. The site, holidaycarsdirect.com, offers motors at a range of locations worldwide from a range of operators and promises all-inclusive prices. It quotes a Peugeot 106 in Alicante at \u00a376 a week. </p> <p>\u0095 The Nursing Home Fees Agency, which funds its free advice service from commission it earns selling financial products, has re-engineered its site on <a href=\"http://www.nhfa.co.uk\">www.nhfa.co.uk</a> to give better information on longer-term care. It covers state assistance, advice on how to meet care costs and preserve capital, legal matters plus the latest on the long-term care front.</p>",

The mortgages are not subject to any special discounts, but Virgin promises that they have been vetted to fit in with its standards of customer service and transparency. Virgin says it will add other types of financial products as well as schemes from a wider range of providers as and when it finds them suitable. In the immediate future, however, customers can look forward to the launch of a chatroom on the site. The Virgin launch is hot on the heals of Financial Services Authority chairman Howard Davies saying online companies are seriously underestimating demand. Egg and Cahoot are cited as two of the culprits. Only time will tell if Virgin falls into the same trap. Free info service for UK savers \u0095 Investors wanting professional information free can now click on to www.comdirect.co.uk. And it is cross-referenced, making it easy to move from prices to news to historical data and dealing. Comdirect is the UK arm of successful German stockbroking operation of the same name. It charges \u00a312.50 for trades under \u00a35,000, \u00a314.50 above. There is a \u00a325 a year fee so the more you deal, the lower the cost. Buying and selling the new index-tracking iShares is free within a self-select Isa. \u0095 Interactive Investor International has opened a funds supermarket at www.iii.co.uk/fundsnow with access to 20 fund managers and over 300 funds. Currently, customers will have to download application forms but iii is promising \"straight through processing to providers\" later this year. \u0095 Newcastle Building Society has come up with NewcastleNet Savings, which claims to beat all rivals on \u00a310,000-plus accounts with a 7.1% rate. But at the minimum \u00a35,000, the account is out-gunned by rivals such as Bristol &amp; West, first-e and Nationwide e-savings. \u0095 Legal &amp; General is going into business with website totallyjewish.com. The initial deal will provide brochureware information on the insurer's protection and investment products. Later this year, customers will be able to access policies and unit trusts online. \u0095 Hire vehicle group Holiday Cars Direct has revamped its website to give online quotes and a \u00a35 discount on online bookings. The site, holidaycarsdirect.com, offers motors at a range of locations worldwide from a range of operators and promises all-inclusive prices. It quotes a Peugeot 106 in Alicante at \u00a376 a week. \u0095 The Nursing Home Fees Agency, which funds its free advice service from commission it earns selling financial products, has re-engineered its site on www.nhfa.co.uk to give better information on longer-term care. It covers state assistance, advice on how to meet care costs and preserve capital, legal matters plus the latest on the long-term care front.",

Until Dave Trott called him and offered him a job, starting on April 1. \"I was elated and my parents were amazed. They thought I would never get a job.

You will be even more fed up when you discover that even if you build up a large lump sum, the income they pay you on retirement is puny. </p> <p>Ten years ago, a married couple who saved \u00a3100,000 into a pension would have been able to pick up an inflation proofed annuity (an annual income) of \u00a311,000 a year at age 65 until they died. Today the same \u00a3100,000 will only give you just \u00a35,800 a year. What's more, if you die soon after retirement, the full \u00a3100,000 goes into the pockets of the life insurance company. </p> <p>Understandably, many pensioners are shocked that their life savings produce such a low income. </p> <p>One caller to Jobs &amp; Money last week was furious about the annuity she has been offered. \"If I'd known it was going to be so little, I would never have taken a pension out in the first place. I would have put the money into property instead,\" she said. Others find it inconceivable that if they die early, their pension money (unlike a property investment) will not go into their estate. This is because annuities are effectively a gamble on your life expectancy. If you live to 100, you win, because you continue receiving the income all those years. But if you die at 66, you lose. </p> <p>On Monday the Social Market Foundation, the leading political think tank, will issue a damning condemnation of the current annuity rules. It says that the rules forcing pensioners to buy a compulsory purchase annuity by age 75 should be abolished. </p> <p>SMF director Phil Collins says: \"Our work shows that under the current system, flexibility and choice for those who choose to invest in their future is sadly lacking. Pensioners are boxed into a corner and forced to purchase an annuity. For many, this is a poor investment. The case against compulsory annuitisation is overwhelming.\" </p> <p>The report was sponsored by pensions company Winterthur Life. \"Gordon Brown needs to take the bull by the horns and end this unfair requirement. The current regulations are more than 40 years old, and with changes to life expectancy, the government must at least consider shifting the age limit from 75 to 80,\" says John Moret of Winterthur. </p> <p>The report concedes that under current rules, investing in property, even without the tax breaks enjoyed by pensions, is more attractive than saving within a pension. </p> <p>Many people are unclear exactly what annuities are. A basic annuity promises to pay a fixed income every year until the death of the holder. </p> <p>But that's only the start. A joint life annuity will pay a proportion of the income to a spouse if the holder dies. And an escalating annuity will give the pensioner a pay rise each year, increasing the annuity income by the level of annual inflation. Both these options will involve taking a lower income at first. </p> <p>An impaired life annuity will give you a higher income - but only if the life insurance company thinks you will die soon because, for example, you are a heavy smoker or have a life-threatening medical condition. </p> <p>But why have annuities become such poor value? Behind the plunging levels of income is a double whammy of falling interest rates and rising life expectancy. </p> <p><strong>Interest rates</strong> </p> <p>The level of interest rates is the single biggest influence on annuity income. The key rate is not base rate but the price of gilts, the long-term government stock that life insurance companies use to finance annuities. </p> <p>In 1990, with inflation surging, the rate of interest paid on medium-term gilts was nearly 11%. Today it is around 5%. A technical situation, related to tough rules introduced after the death of Robert Maxwell and the Mirror pension scandal that emerged afterwards, has pushed gilt levels to new lows. The rules may shortly be eased, but with almost all economists in agreement that we are in a low inflation, low interest rate period, there is little hope that gilts (and therefore annuity rates) will bounce back up. </p> <p><strong>Mortality</strong> </p> <p>Because pensioners are enjoying longer lives, the amount of money built up in a retirement pot has to be spread over more years and, therefore, the annuity income paid out is lower. A recent report from the Continuous Mortality Investigation Bureau, covering 30m people, found dramatic improvements in life expectancy for people aged 65 over the last 20 years. Men and non-smokers, in particular, are living far longer. Colin Kirkwood of the CMIB said: \"The numbers of people who now survive into their 80s has grown remarkably. But the longer people live, the worse annuity rates will become.\" </p> <p>The annuity industry has not been deaf to the complaints about falling incomes. In the mid-90s new legislation permitted the introduction of deferred annuities, which allowed people retiring at age 65 to leave their pension money invested in shares until age 75, and buy an annuity then. But the extra investment growth achieved on the shares was cancelled out by the continued fall in annuity rates, leaving holders little or no better off. Deferred annuities are also only appropriate for savers with pension pots of at least \u00a3100,000. </p> <p>The rise of specialist annuity products, which segment the \u00a37.5bn-a-year market into good lives (ie: the ones that die early) and bad lives (ie: the ones who live long) will mean that the healthier will receive even lower incomes, because they can no longer rely on the early deaths of others to cross-subsidise their annuity. </p> <p>The fortunate are those employees who are members of final salary pension schemes, where retirement incomes are not influenced by the vagaries of annuity rate fluctuations. Sadly, many of these are now closing and being replaced by money purchase schemes, where the saver will be forced to rely upon buying an annuity with the cash they build up. </p> <p>Until then, there are four choices for today's savers. Firstly, you can pile ever more money into your pension plan. Secondly, you can continue working long beyond age 60 or 65. Thirdly, you can take out a share-based individual savings account, which will not involve having to buy an annuity. Or finally you can forget pension plans altogether and opt for buying a rental property instead.</p>",

That only became apparent later.</p> <p>\"My resistance to accepting any more money at that stage overcame my love for money.\"</p> <p>When questioned on the details of transcripts of the conversations between himself and \"Sanjay\", believed to be the London-based bookmaker Sanjiv Chawla, that were released by New Delhi police earlier this year, Cronje complained that the tapping of his phone had been an invasion of his privacy. </p> <p>And, while he admitted having \"a lot of conversations\" with Chawla, he said that \"95% of the time I was stringing him along\".</p> <p>Cronje, when questioned about several points in transcripts that have been in public circulation for more than a month, said: \"Whose phones were tapped or bugged? Was it Sanjay's or mine? Was it a cellphone or a hotel phone? Isn't this an invasion of privacy? Am I being tried by the media?\"</p> <p>Cronje has admitted to receiving $80,000 (\u00a350,000) from the bookmaker Mukesh Gupta in 1996, after alleging that he was introduced to him by the former India captain Mohammed Azharuddin, and said another $20,000 (\u00a313,000) paid into his account could have come from Gupta. </p> <p>But he said yesterday he had stayed clean for more than three years before accepting 50,000 rand (\u00a34,500) from the bookmaker Marlon Aronstam in January during the Centurion Park test against England.</p> <p>Judge Edwin King, who must decide whether Cronje has made a full disclosure of the facts and therefore be granted immunity from prosecution and a possible prison sentence, pressed Cronje on Aronstam's offer to donate 500,000 rand to a charity of his choice to set up the game.</p> <p>\"Did you really believe that Mr Aronstam's offer ... was genuine?\" asked King. \"Yes, I did,\" Cronje replied.</p> <p>\"Of your choice?\" King said.</p> <p>Of the \"gift\" that Aronstam promised for Cronje's connivance, Cronje said: \"I would have been happy with a drink in the bar of the hotel. I thought it might be money but I didn't know.\"</p> <p>\"If you would have been happy with a drink in the bar then you must have been surprised, even shocked to be given 50,000 rand,\" asked Shamila Batohi, who is effectively the commission's chief prosecutor.</p> <p>\"Yes, I thought he was a very generous man,\" Cronje said.</p> <p>Having implicated Azharuddin for introducing him to Gupta in his initial statement last Thursday, Cronje said yesterday: \"He may not have known what Mr Gupta wanted to do. He left the room before we talked about it.\"</p> <p>Azharuddin, who was taken in for questioning by Indian federal investigators in New Delhi yesterday, has said he did not know Gupta and denies involvement in match-fixing.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Hansie Cronje attacked the Indian police phone-tap tapes that sparked the match-fixing case against him but admitted that his acceptance of money from bookmakers became an addiction, as he faced a second day of cross-examination at the King Commission here yesterday. While the former South African captain complained of being subjected to \"trial by media\" over the tapes of his phone conversations with Indian bookmakers during a tour earlier this year, he likened his temptations in accepting money from them to that of an alcoholic. Having admitted to an \"unfortunate love of money\" on Wednesday, Cronje was asked why he accepted some offers but not others, even when the circumstances were similar. \"I am not an alcoholic and I have never been addicted to nicotine, but I understand there are times when you give in to the temptation,\" he said. \"At various times guilt made me realise what I was doing wrong,\" he said when asked why there was a gap of three years before he accepted money again in January of this year. \"I didn't realise at that stage I was hooked. That only became apparent later. \"My resistance to accepting any more money at that stage overcame my love for money.\" When questioned on the details of transcripts of the conversations between himself and \"Sanjay\", believed to be the London-based bookmaker Sanjiv Chawla, that were released by New Delhi police earlier this year, Cronje complained that the tapping of his phone had been an invasion of his privacy. And, while he admitted having \"a lot of conversations\" with Chawla, he said that \"95% of the time I was stringing him along\". Cronje, when questioned about several points in transcripts that have been in public circulation for more than a month, said: \"Whose phones were tapped or bugged? Was it Sanjay's or mine? Was it a cellphone or a hotel phone? Isn't this an invasion of privacy? Am I being tried by the media?\" Cronje has admitted to receiving $80,000 (\u00a350,000) from the bookmaker Mukesh Gupta in 1996, after alleging that he was introduced to him by the former India captain Mohammed Azharuddin, and said another $20,000 (\u00a313,000) paid into his account could have come from Gupta. But he said yesterday he had stayed clean for more than three years before accepting 50,000 rand (\u00a34,500) from the bookmaker Marlon Aronstam in January during the Centurion Park test against England. Judge Edwin King, who must decide whether Cronje has made a full disclosure of the facts and therefore be granted immunity from prosecution and a possible prison sentence, pressed Cronje on Aronstam's offer to donate 500,000 rand to a charity of his choice to set up the game. \"Did you really believe that Mr Aronstam's offer ... was genuine?\" asked King. \"Yes, I did,\" Cronje replied. \"Of your choice?\" King said. Of the \"gift\" that Aronstam promised for Cronje's connivance, Cronje said: \"I would have been happy with a drink in the bar of the hotel. I thought it might be money but I didn't know.\" \"If you would have been happy with a drink in the bar then you must have been surprised, even shocked to be given 50,000 rand,\" asked Shamila Batohi, who is effectively the commission's chief prosecutor. \"Yes, I thought he was a very generous man,\" Cronje said. Having implicated Azharuddin for introducing him to Gupta in his initial statement last Thursday, Cronje said yesterday: \"He may not have known what Mr Gupta wanted to do. He left the room before we talked about it.\" Azharuddin, who was taken in for questioning by Indian federal investigators in New Delhi yesterday, has said he did not know Gupta and denies involvement in match-fixing.",

Formerly of Aston Villa and Row X, there was a time when Savo Milosevic was of more danger to the executive boxes than opposing defences.</p> <p>From blunderer to plunderer, the Yugoslavia striker has been a rejuvenated figure at Euro 2000. He headed his fourth goal against Spain on Wednesday and is now the competition's leading scorer.</p> <p>In certain parts of the west Midlands that may be more surprising than, say, Phil Neville being named defender of the tournament.</p> <p>But, as regular Savo-watchers will testify, his scoring exploits should not really be any surprise. This, after all, is a player who, with Real Zaragoza, has established himself among La Liga's 20-goals-a-season brethren.</p> <p>The man once known as Savo Miss-a-lot-evic has racked up 24 goals in 47 games for his country and now has set his sights on Stjepan Bobek's all-time national record of 37.</p> <p>\"Everything has worked out as I hoped,\" he says. \"I'm doing very well here but why should I be surprised? Just look at my scoring record and what I have done in Spain. I can always score goals, no matter what some people in England may think.</p> <p>\"It is all about motivation. When I look around and see my team-mates giving everything it makes me play with all my heart. I will play until I fall down for my country.</p> <p>\"I am the record scorer in the current team, so none of this is new to me. In fact, my object now is to become the record Yugoslavia scorer of all time. If I don't succeed I will feel like killing myself.\"</p> <p>All of which is a far cry from his slump-shouldered Villa days. Brian Little paid \u00a33.5m to sign him from Partizan Belgrade in 1995 but in three turbulent seasons he managed only 31 goals.</p> <p>Matters came to a head when Milosevic's umpteenth six-yard miss in a match against Blackburn was the catalyst for him to be abused by his own fans. When he spat at them he was transfer-listed by Little's successor John Gregory and, within a couple of months, Villa had recouped their money from Zaragoza.</p> <p>Even so Milosevic still has an admirer in Little. \"There was never any doubt in my mind that he would become a great goalscorer,\" Little says.</p> <p>\"When he came to England he was only 21 and it was hard for him to settle. He was worried about the events back home where his family were in the middle of a war zone. He didn't score a lot of goals here but he still had everything to be a first-class player.\"</p> <p>Daniel Taylor</p> <p> <strong>Stefano Fiore</strong> (Italy)</p> <p>Stefano Fiore must pinch himself as he settles down to his waffles at breakfast in Belgium. A year ago, after another season without regular football at Parma, Euro 2000 must have felt as likely a destination this summer as the moon.</p> <p>Then the midfielder was restricted to occasional club appearances in place of Juan Veron. Tomorrow he will be the pivotal figure in his country's attempt to reach the semi-finals. The 25-year-old would be entitled to ask: Where did it all go right?</p> <p>The answer lies in a transfer to Udinese last summer as part of the deal which took Amoroso to Parma. A makeweight then, Fiore is a heavyweight now. He ended with nine goals in 32 games for his new club, making his Italy debut in February. The game against Romania will provide only his seventh cap but already he is indispensable. As Paolo Condo of Gazzetta dello Sport puts it: \"We have champions in Maldini, Nesta, and so on. But Fiore is the key man.\"</p> <p>Technically outstanding, Fiore dictates the pace and makes Italy tick. Often it is simple, occasionally spectacular, as his goal against Belgium showed. If Kevin Keegan wants to teach England's players how to keep possession, he could do worse than make them watch this man.</p> <p>His late but rapid rise has come about purely because his talent has finally been allowed to shine. Some doubted whether he had the the strength of personality to lead a major club, never mind an international side. But the courage of Italy's coach Dino Zoff has been vindicated.</p> <p>\"Fiore is a very modern midfielder,\" Condo says of the former under-21 international. \"He scores goals, he's a good offensive player and when the other team has the ball he can defend. And he is particularly important because Christian Vieri is not around.</p> <p>\"When Italy have Vieri in attack they play all the balls to him and can go slowly because he is able to hold the ball and wait for the team to arrive in attack. [Filippo] Inzaghi has other qualities. Now we must arrive in the box very quickly, so Fiore is extremely important.\"</p> <p>That strike against Belgium was a classic example, Fiore feeding the ball to Inzaghi, taking an instant return and shooting past Filip de Wilde from the edge of the area. As if to announce his arrival, Fiore turned his back to the crowd and pointed to the name on his shirt.</p> <p>Few in Italy needed reminding. Internazionale, Lazio and others are keen to buy him but Udinese are determined to hold on to the player for another season to maximise the profit. They have an impressive record of buying cheap and selling big.</p> <p>Fiore has retained a professional approach despite his sudden rise to fame. Once the boyfriend of Miss Parma, he is becoming Mr Italy now. </p> <p>Jon Brodkin</p> <p> <strong>Cristian Chivu</strong> (Romania)</p> <p>When he chipped that ball in to England's far post it is difficult to know whether Cristian Chivu (left) really meant to find the back of the net or the head of Viorel Moldovan. It doesn't matter. For with that goal the 19-year-old Ajax defender found instant fame.</p> <p>It has been a heady rise for the boy from Resita, who only three years ago was playing for that small-town team and whose inclusion in the Romania squad came as such a surprise that the official Uefa media guide could not manage a photo of him.</p> <p>But the young defender's confidence has remained unaffected by the altitude of his surroundings and the manner in which Chivu has filled the left-back position has impressed his veteran team-mates. His tenacity and bravery in defence allied to a poise on the ball and willingness to get forward mark him out as one of the best of Romania's new generation.</p> <p>The game against England was only Chivu's fifth cap. But despite being booked and blamed by some for giving away a penalty - actually Paul Ince was not fouled but trod on the ball - Chivu emerged with his already growing reputation enhanced. \"I thought Chivu was man of the match and did an excellent job marking Beckham,\" said his team-mate Dan Petrescu. \"In two or three years I am sure he will be the best left-back in the world.\"</p> <p>The son of a former Romania international, Chivu says he started playing in the streets when he was eight. He developed his game at school and joined CSM Resita at 14, making his first-team debut at 16. A year later, he moved up a notch to Universitatea Craiova and, in August 1999, he was at Ajax, moving for \u00a33m on a six-year deal. </p> <p>A scout for the Dutch club had spotted him playing for the Romania Under-21s in a tournament in France. Then at the start of last season Ajax's player-coach, Danny Blind, went to watch him against Dinamo Bucharest. And in no time he was wearing the red and white, thrust into the first team a month after his arrival because of injuries to other defenders.</p> <p>He has been a fixture since, his burgeoning talent impressive enough to earn a place in Romania's Euro 2000 starting line-up for their three games so far. The only black mark against Chivu has been the four red cards he picked up for Ajax last season. </p> <p>However, he is not an aggressive player. In fact the former Internazionale coach, Mircea Lucescu, says that Chivu \"could be a strong leader for his generation\". With his ability to play in central defence, he could be a versatile leader too. </p> <p>But for the moment he is a boy among men, his stylish contribution to Romania's continued presence in Euro 2000 an apprenticeship and an adventure rolled into one.</p> <p>Martin Thorpe</p> <p> <strong>Alfonso</strong> (Spain)</p> <p>The headline in Spain's Marca newspaper said it all: \"Long live the mother who gave birth to you.\" With one swipe of his left foot Alfonso Perez has become a national hero.</p> <p>While Spanish eyes looked to Raul for deliverance against Yugoslavia on Wednesday, it came seven minutes into stoppage time from a player who wears white boots, an Alice band and, until now, has never been totally accepted by the Spanish media.</p> <p>Alfonso - he plays under the single name - clearly has an impeccable sense of timing. Spain had just equalised to make it 3-3 but were on the first flight home unless they could find another goal. Only a win would be enough for European football's great under-achievers.</p> <p>A high cross was pumped into the penalty area and the Slavs backed off. Alfonso was loitering with intent 12 yards out. The ball came his way. He steadied himself, drew back his foot and lashed out. The next few moments are a blur.</p> <p>\"It was like a daze. When I saw the ball hit the net, I just lost my head,\" he says. \"I don't know what happened. I was running away and then there were 20 bodies on top of me.</p> <p>\"I just concentrated on keeping the ball down. After that it was a case of praying for good luck. But it was a miracle, the whole thing was a miracle.\"</p> <p>So Spain lived to fight another day after one of the most dramatic matches in national memory. And if this really is going to be their year, then Alfonso will surely be offered the Freedom of Iberia when they return.</p> <p>An intricate player, with a penchant for creating goals as well as scoring them, Alfonso scored Spain's first and last goal on Wednesday to rescue them from yet another early exit.</p> <p>The Real Betis striker now has 11 goals in 35 games for his country, an impressive tally for a player who has suffered from injury problems and was only a substitute in the first match against Norway.</p> <p>Presumably the 27-year-old has cemented a place in the starting line-up for Sunday's quarter-final against France in Bruges.</p> <p>The sub-plot as Spain advance is that he is looking for a new club because Real Betis were relegated last season, although prospective new employers may balk at the figures involved. His contract does not expire until 2003 and it will cost \u00a325m for another club to buy it out.</p> <p>Even so, his father and agent, Jose Perez, insists the former Real Madrid player is in the shop window. \"For his ethical behaviour and dedication to the team, they should ease the way for Alfonso to leave. It is only fair.\"</p> <p>Daniel Taylor</p> <p> <strong>Boudewijn Zenden</strong> (Holland)</p> <p>It was Ronaldo who gave Boudewijn Zenden the nickname Bolo at PSV Eindhoven, deciding his team-mate's real name was too much of a mouthful. And a little of the Brazilian's scoring touch seems to have rubbed off on Zenden at the right time.</p> <p>Having managed three goals in his first 21 games for Holland, the Barcelona player has contributed two so far in this tournament. His expertly taken winner against France confirmed him as one of the most exciting and important members of Frank Rijkaard's squad. </p> <p>Yet there is more to Zenden's game than finding the net. His pace, balance and ability to beat men and cross make him a menace on both flanks. A shimmy, dart and centre to set up Ronald de Boer's tap-in against Denmark epitomised the flashes of inspiration he can offer. At PSV he was a pin-up but the 23-year-old is not just a pretty face.</p> <p>\"He's a sparkling player,\" says a Dutch journalist who was close to Zenden during his time at PSV. \"The people here like his style. He's fast, he never hides and he knows how to dribble and go past opponents. He's the personification of Dutch attacking football.\"</p> <p>Zenden's proficiency in martial arts may not sound much use on the pitch unless Norman Hunter makes a comeback. But the skills he picked up at his father's judo school in the south of the Netherlands have added something to those honed in the youth system at PSV.</p> <p>\"You should look at the way he reacts when he is tackled and goes down,\" the journalist says. \"He uses the judo technique of breaking his fall and in an instant he's on his feet again. It's amazingly fast.\"</p> <p>Zenden speaks at least four languages and plays in as many positions. A left wing-back of late for Barcelona, he played the first game here behind Patrick Kluivert and most the second on the right flank. Now he seems settled at left midfield.</p> <p>Left-footed, he looks most dangerous in that role. After moving there in place of Marc Overmars against Denmark he set up De Boer's goal and scored from a Michael Reiziger pass. Against France he drifted in to finish unerringly from Sander Westerveld's long punt. Whether Zenden or Overmars should play prompts much domestic discussion but Rijkaard seems intent on including both.</p> <p>One of six Barcelona players in the Dutch squad, Zenden's two years at Nou Camp have been up and down. </p> <p>Restricted to eight starts in his first season by Rivaldo as he struggled for form, things have improved since he took on a more defensive role. Playing there in place of the Catalan Sergi has not endeared him to the fans. But at home he is guaranteed a hero's welcome.</p> <p>Jon Brodkin</p>",

      "bodyText": "Savo Milosevic (Yugoslavia) How things have changed. Formerly of Aston Villa and Row X, there was a time when Savo Milosevic was of more danger to the executive boxes than opposing defences. From blunderer to plunderer, the Yugoslavia striker has been a rejuvenated figure at Euro 2000. He headed his fourth goal against Spain on Wednesday and is now the competition's leading scorer. In certain parts of the west Midlands that may be more surprising than, say, Phil Neville being named defender of the tournament. But, as regular Savo-watchers will testify, his scoring exploits should not really be any surprise. This, after all, is a player who, with Real Zaragoza, has established himself among La Liga's 20-goals-a-season brethren.

Even so Milosevic still has an admirer in Little. \"There was never any doubt in my mind that he would become a great goalscorer,\" Little says. \"When he came to England he was only 21 and it was hard for him to settle. He was worried about the events back home where his family were in the middle of a war zone. He didn't score a lot of goals here but he still had everything to be a first-class player.\" Daniel Taylor Stefano Fiore (Italy) Stefano Fiore must pinch himself as he settles down to his waffles at breakfast in Belgium. A year ago, after another season without regular football at Parma, Euro 2000 must have felt as likely a destination this summer as the moon. Then the midfielder was restricted to occasional club appearances in place of Juan Veron. Tomorrow he will be the pivotal figure in his country's attempt to reach the semi-finals. The 25-year-old would be entitled to ask: Where did it all go right? The answer lies in a transfer to Udinese last summer as part of the deal which took Amoroso to Parma. A makeweight then, Fiore is a heavyweight now. He ended with nine goals in 32 games for his new club, making his Italy debut in February. The game against Romania will provide only his seventh cap but already he is indispensable. As Paolo Condo of Gazzetta dello Sport puts it: \"We have champions in Maldini, Nesta, and so on. But Fiore is the key man.\" Technically outstanding, Fiore dictates the pace and makes Italy tick. Often it is simple, occasionally spectacular, as his goal against Belgium showed. If Kevin Keegan wants to teach England's players how to keep possession, he could do worse than make them watch this man. His late but rapid rise has come about purely because his talent has finally been allowed to shine. Some doubted whether he had the the strength of personality to lead a major club, never mind an international side. But the courage of Italy's coach Dino Zoff has been vindicated. \"Fiore is a very modern midfielder,\" Condo says of the former under-21 international. \"He scores goals, he's a good offensive player and when the other team has the ball he can defend. And he is particularly important because Christian Vieri is not around. \"When Italy have Vieri in attack they play all the balls to him and can go slowly because he is able to hold the ball and wait for the team to arrive in attack. [Filippo] Inzaghi has other qualities. Now we must arrive in the box very quickly, so Fiore is extremely important.\" That strike against Belgium was a classic example, Fiore feeding the ball to Inzaghi, taking an instant return and shooting past Filip de Wilde from the edge of the area. As if to announce his arrival, Fiore turned his back to the crowd and pointed to the name on his shirt. Few in Italy needed reminding. Internazionale, Lazio and others are keen to buy him but Udinese are determined to hold on to the player for another season to maximise the profit. They have an impressive record of buying cheap and selling big. Fiore has retained a professional approach despite his sudden rise to fame. Once the boyfriend of Miss Parma, he is becoming Mr Italy now. Jon Brodkin Cristian Chivu (Romania) When he chipped that ball in to England's far post it is difficult to know whether Cristian Chivu (left) really meant to find the back of the net or the head of Viorel Moldovan. It doesn't matter. For with that goal the 19-year-old Ajax defender found instant fame. It has been a heady rise for the boy from Resita, who only three years ago was playing for that small-town team and whose inclusion in the Romania squad came as such a surprise that the official Uefa media guide could not manage a photo of him. But the young defender's confidence has remained unaffected by the altitude of his surroundings and the manner in which Chivu has filled the left-back position has impressed his veteran team-mates. His tenacity and bravery in defence allied to a poise on the ball and willingness to get forward mark him out as one of the best of Romania's new generation. The game against England was only Chivu's fifth cap. But despite being booked and blamed by some for giving away a penalty - actually Paul Ince was not fouled but trod on the ball - Chivu emerged with his already growing reputation enhanced. \"I thought Chivu was man of the match and did an excellent job marking Beckham,\" said his team-mate Dan Petrescu. \"In two or three years I am sure he will be the best left-back in the world.\" The son of a former Romania international, Chivu says he started playing in the streets when he was eight. He developed his game at school and joined CSM Resita at 14, making his first-team debut at 16. A year later, he moved up a notch to Universitatea Craiova and, in August 1999, he was at Ajax, moving for \u00a33m on a six-year deal. A scout for the Dutch club had spotted him playing for the Romania Under-21s in a tournament in France. Then at the start of last season Ajax's player-coach, Danny Blind, went to watch him against Dinamo Bucharest. And in no time he was wearing the red and white, thrust into the first team a month after his arrival because of injuries to other defenders. He has been a fixture since, his burgeoning talent impressive enough to earn a place in Romania's Euro 2000 starting line-up for their three games so far. The only black mark against Chivu has been the four red cards he picked up for Ajax last season. However, he is not an aggressive player. In fact the former Internazionale coach, Mircea Lucescu, says that Chivu \"could be a strong leader for his generation\". With his ability to play in central defence, he could be a versatile leader too. But for the moment he is a boy among men, his stylish contribution to Romania's continued presence in Euro 2000 an apprenticeship and an adventure rolled into one. Martin Thorpe Alfonso (Spain) The headline in Spain's Marca newspaper said it all: \"Long live the mother who gave birth to you.\" With one swipe of his left foot Alfonso Perez has become a national hero. While Spanish eyes looked to Raul for deliverance against Yugoslavia on Wednesday, it came seven minutes into stoppage time from a player who wears white boots, an Alice band and, until now, has never been totally accepted by the Spanish media. Alfonso - he plays under the single name - clearly has an impeccable sense of timing. Spain had just equalised to make it 3-3 but were on the first flight home unless they could find another goal. Only a win would be enough for European football's great under-achievers. A high cross was pumped into the penalty area and the Slavs backed off. Alfonso was loitering with intent 12 yards out. The ball came his way. He steadied himself, drew back his foot and lashed out. The next few moments are a blur. \"It was like a daze. When I saw the ball hit the net, I just lost my head,\" he says. \"I don't know what happened. I was running away and then there were 20 bodies on top of me. \"I just concentrated on keeping the ball down. After that it was a case of praying for good luck. But it was a miracle, the whole thing was a miracle.\" So Spain lived to fight another day after one of the most dramatic matches in national memory. And if this really is going to be their year, then Alfonso will surely be offered the Freedom of Iberia when they return. An intricate player, with a penchant for creating goals as well as scoring them, Alfonso scored Spain's first and last goal on Wednesday to rescue them from yet another early exit. The Real Betis striker now has 11 goals in 35 games for his country, an impressive tally for a player who has suffered from injury problems and was only a substitute in the first match against Norway. Presumably the 27-year-old has cemented a place in the starting line-up for Sunday's quarter-final against France in Bruges. The sub-plot as Spain advance is that he is looking for a new club because Real Betis were relegated last season, although prospective new employers may balk at the figures involved. His contract does not expire until 2003 and it will cost \u00a325m for another club to buy it out. Even so, his father and agent, Jose Perez, insists the former Real Madrid player is in the shop window. \"For his ethical behaviour and dedication to the team, they should ease the way for Alfonso to leave. It is only fair.\" Daniel Taylor Boudewijn Zenden (Holland) It was Ronaldo who gave Boudewijn Zenden the nickname Bolo at PSV Eindhoven, deciding his team-mate's real name was too much of a mouthful. And a little of the Brazilian's scoring touch seems to have rubbed off on Zenden at the right time. Having managed three goals in his first 21 games for Holland, the Barcelona player has contributed two so far in this tournament. His expertly taken winner against France confirmed him as one of the most exciting and important members of Frank Rijkaard's squad. Yet there is more to Zenden's game than finding the net. His pace, balance and ability to beat men and cross make him a menace on both flanks. A shimmy, dart and centre to set up Ronald de Boer's tap-in against Denmark epitomised the flashes of inspiration he can offer. At PSV he was a pin-up but the 23-year-old is not just a pretty face. \"He's a sparkling player,\" says a Dutch journalist who was close to Zenden during his time at PSV. \"The people here like his style. He's fast, he never hides and he knows how to dribble and go past opponents. He's the personification of Dutch attacking football.\" Zenden's proficiency in martial arts may not sound much use on the pitch unless Norman Hunter makes a comeback. But the skills he picked up at his father's judo school in the south of the Netherlands have added something to those honed in the youth system at PSV. \"You should look at the way he reacts when he is tackled and goes down,\" the journalist says. \"He uses the judo technique of breaking his fall and in an instant he's on his feet again. It's amazingly fast.\" Zenden speaks at least four languages and plays in as many positions. A left wing-back of late for Barcelona, he played the first game here behind Patrick Kluivert and most the second on the right flank. Now he seems settled at left midfield. Left-footed, he looks most dangerous in that role. After moving there in place of Marc Overmars against Denmark he set up De Boer's goal and scored from a Michael Reiziger pass. Against France he drifted in to finish unerringly from Sander Westerveld's long punt. Whether Zenden or Overmars should play prompts much domestic discussion but Rijkaard seems intent on including both. One of six Barcelona players in the Dutch squad, Zenden's two years at Nou Camp have been up and down. Restricted to eight starts in his first season by Rivaldo as he struggled for form, things have improved since he took on a more defensive role. Playing there in place of the Catalan Sergi has not endeared him to the fans. But at home he is guaranteed a hero's welcome. Jon Brodkin",

Until the next Euro 2000, the game is up, the frolics finished, the fun, along with the face paint and the comedy strap-on pot bellies, pushed to the back of the cupboard. Yet for some reason some of them is still trying to carry on as if there's still summat worth playing for. Yours truly has yet to work out why your continentals, your French, your Dutch, your Spaniards and that, still think there's any point staying on for now the party's over. Obviously it takes a while for your euro to drop Belgium-side. I know it is most deffo not the instinct of the English media at moments of national sporting defeat to go on and on and on about it, shaking their heads, wringing their hands and the players necks. I know we don't like to drown ourselves in self-pity and post mortems, but prefer, as a nation, just to lean over, ruffle the lad Nev's hair and say \"nay mind, son, better luck next time\". But personally, yours truly feels that this moment in time is exactly the right one to ask some important questions about the future of the English game. Such as: who'll get to wear the mighty magenta boots now Keowny's destined for the scrap heap? And Badger Bonce: is that still the right name for the geezer?

      "bodyText": "Zhang Yimou's Not One Less is a world away from, say, the gorgeously rich, elaborately realised period drama of his Raise the Red Lantern. Premiered here at the London Film Festival in November, this is part social documentary, part wan pastoral comedy, performed by non-professionals and semi-professionals largely duplicating the roles they play in real life. It is the story of a 13-year-old girl, Wei, who arrives in a remote village to be a substitute teacher and all-round care-giver to a large class of rowdy infants. She is hardly older or better educated than her charges and is tricked out of her agreed wage by a wily mayor, who promises her a bonus if she prevents any of the children dropping out of school - so when one leaves for the city to beg, Wei goes looking for him. This film refuses the easy crescendos and crises of ordinary drama; it moves at a very slow walking pace, changing to a rising trot by the end. You feel the unnerving, yet exhilarating sense of having a window on real life, and the authentic story of a quietly unheroic heroism of someone young, frightened and poor.",

Abbie's job is funkily to instruct her various classes, and there's even a scene in which, broodingly alone, she does a very complicated black-belt yoga manoeuvre involving lots of tricky supple things, although this is filmed in long shot. Abbie is smart, funny and has what her outgoing boyfriend crisply informs us is a \"fantastic body\". Yet she can't find a man and yearns for a baby. </p> <p>As fortune would have it, she is best friends with Robert (Rupert Everett), a designer gardener, gay, recently jilted. They are lonely; a one-night-only sexual chemistry sparks between the two of them; Abbie gets pregnant. And so a thoroughly modern Millie, 21st-century solution suggests itself: they will set up house together; Robert will be a father to the child - but they can both date as if she was a single mom, and he her gay buddy, sharing house. </p> <p>It's a seductively contemporary-sounding m\u00e9nage, a witty fictional response to the Blairite/Clintonite quasi-liberal politics of upholding family values while at the same time trying to redefine the \"family\". It appears to challenge assumptions from all sides of the sexual politics spectrum; and as gay men might tire of the hedonistic stereotype, so straight men might feel envious of what appears to be gay men's unmediated access to female friendship. (Tina Brown's Talk magazine recently suggested that women desire emotionally intelligent men who are JGE - Just Gay Enough.) </p> <p>It's not an entirely new idea, though: as recently as 1998, Nicholas Hytner's The Object of My Affection had a very similar high concept, and as for the idea of a gay man having intensely loving feelings for his children within a conventional marital household, there is the example of Oscar Wilde - which, oddly, is never invoked in this film. </p> <p>But what lets it down from the word go - what sinks this film with all hands - is the relentlessly heavy-handed feel to the whole enterprise. John Schlesinger directs with granite gloves. Effectively, Rupert Everett is being asked to reprise and extend his grandstanding performance in My Best Friend's Wedding, complete with rapid-response cellphone advice, mercurial wit, playacting, singing in public, etc etc. </p> <p>But where that performance had lightness and insouciant style, his screen presence here is freighted with brow-furrowing earnestness and moments in which Everett has to break down in tears and - inevitably - come to terms with his own father. Finally, Abbie and Robert's household falls apart on the question of who gets the child when a relationship of Abbie's gets serious, and Rupert finds himself in a very self-conscious new version of Kramer Vs Kramer, with Everett as a taller, handsomer and better dressed Dustin Hoffman. </p> <p>The family courts in the state of California, are represented, I sense accurately, as pretty reactionary in the matter of gays and childcare: for a reversal of roles, it's interesting to consider Mike Newell's The Good Father from 1987, which had Anthony Hopkins as a man inciting his friend, played by Jim Broadbent, to contest his estranged wife's and her female lover's application for child custody. In the time of Kramer and The Good Father, gay politics and gender politics could be a bitter and acrimonious bone of contention between the principals themselves; here, a heavy consensus notionally reigns and that kind of high-octane opposition is off the agenda, leaving only a squishy, touchy-feely sense of sadness. </p> <p>None of this need have been a problem, had it not been that Madonna never fully inhabits her role, never for one moment forgets her mission to attain seriousness and maturity in a new medium - yet clearly considers it expedient to keep in touch with her music fan base. (At one point she says allusively: \"I've made up my mind, and I'm having this baby.\") </p> <p>Madonna gives an averagely competent account of herself, yet the magic ingredient of believable spontaneity and fun is missing from the first half of the film, and absent from the second half are the real anger and real pain that go with the end of all relationships.</p>",

The probation inspectors who carried out the report as part of the government's response to the Stephen Lawrence inquiry were shocked by what they found.

Mr Smith said the report's findings were particularly depressing after the probation service had played a trail-blazing role on race equality work in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The report said that many black probation staff had no confidence in the policies, while among some white staff the fear of being called racist outweighed fear of being found incompetent.

And they're certainly not the overwhelming favourites the bookies make them out to be against Yugoslavia (who can be backed at 9/2).

Having proved themselves to be the worst team in the tournament, they are utterly inappropriate guests in the quarter finals and I expect Portugal to show them the door in unceremonious fashion. The Portuguese, after all, have the most lethal attack in the tournament and will punish the laughable defensive abilities of Abdullah and co. Three times, to be precise.</p> <p>Sunday<br> Holland v Yugoslavia: Draw after 90 minutes 2/1 (\u00a310)</p> <p>These are perhaps the two most erratic sides in the tournament. Okay, Holland had a 100% record in their group but always looked susceptible to pressure in every game. Yugoslavia are just as capable of scoring goals as they are of conceding them and enter into every game hell for leather. They should be able to exploit the persistently fragile Dutch confidence and secure a draw by the end of 90 minutes.</p> <p><strong>Paul MacInnes</strong></p> <p>Saturday <br> Portugal v Turkey: Portugal to win 2-1 7/1 (\u00a34)</p> <p>I think (although why I should listen to myself any more on these matters I don't know) that Turkey will give Portugal a tough game in Amsterdam. They've improved with each match so far and have the support of a delirious nation behind them. The Portuguese seem similarly determined however, and have a lot more ability at their disposal. So, a goal for Turkey, but a win for the Portuguese. Either that or the complete opposite. Or something in-between maybe. </p> <p> Sunday<br> Spain v France: First goalscored G Mendieta 11/1 (\u00a38.50)</p> <p>If everything goes to plan, plan Z that is, then this will be my final bet. I like Mendieta, I like him a lot. I would marry him if it is was legal, but instead I will stake my remaining cash on his ability to find space around the box and get a shot off.</p> <p>I might try this gambling thing again.

Having proved themselves to be the worst team in the tournament, they are utterly inappropriate guests in the quarter finals and I expect Portugal to show them the door in unceremonious fashion. The Portuguese, after all, have the most lethal attack in the tournament and will punish the laughable defensive abilities of Abdullah and co. Three times, to be precise. Sunday Holland v Yugoslavia: Draw after 90 minutes 2/1 (\u00a310) These are perhaps the two most erratic sides in the tournament. Okay, Holland had a 100% record in their group but always looked susceptible to pressure in every game. Yugoslavia are just as capable of scoring goals as they are of conceding them and enter into every game hell for leather. They should be able to exploit the persistently fragile Dutch confidence and secure a draw by the end of 90 minutes. Paul MacInnes Saturday Portugal v Turkey: Portugal to win 2-1 7/1 (\u00a34) I think (although why I should listen to myself any more on these matters I don't know) that Turkey will give Portugal a tough game in Amsterdam. They've improved with each match so far and have the support of a delirious nation behind them. The Portuguese seem similarly determined however, and have a lot more ability at their disposal. So, a goal for Turkey, but a win for the Portuguese. Either that or the complete opposite. Or something in-between maybe. Sunday Spain v France: First goalscored G Mendieta 11/1 (\u00a38.50) If everything goes to plan, plan Z that is, then this will be my final bet. I like Mendieta, I like him a lot. I would marry him if it is was legal, but instead I will stake my remaining cash on his ability to find space around the box and get a shot off. I might try this gambling thing again. Ciao.",

      "bodyText": "Customisation has reached epidemic proportions. Now that designer looks are in the high street before you can say \"Prada Bowli ...\" the smart money has realised that DIY is the only way to achieve true originality. After contenting ourselves with sticking studs on to tops, fixing diamant\u00e9s on to jeans and adding bits of lace to our vests, enter, stage left, the new scissor phenomenon: instead of adding things to clothes, we are now attacking them with very sharp objects. Silly as it may seem to those outside fashion parameters, it is now all the rage to wear T-shirts that are slashed at the neck, cut in tassels at the bottom, with little holes cut out all over. The appeal being that this is one trend that is completely free and can be created by anyone, regardless of artistic talent. \"I saw them in Urban Outfitters for \u00a330 and thought I could do it myself,\" says one London-based fashion ladette, who likes \"adding an original touch to a plain top\". It's really very easy: simply take a T-shirt (with or without logo), snip, snip, snip, and it's instantly transformed from mundane to, er, extremely fashionable indeed. You can create any pattern you want - diamonds, hearts, even the girls-holding-hands you cut out of paperchains as a kid, if you're feeling ambitious. Fun for the moment but watch out: this trend will have expired by, oh, the end of next week.",

You will have seen him clinging to skinny young chests in fashionable bars; grinning at you from wallets flashed in cool checkout queues; winking from Cameron Diaz's handbag, Drew Barrymore's vest top and Graham Coxon's guitar strap. On all kinds of accessories in fashion stores across the world (New York, Tokyo, Hoxton), Julius is the cheeky, chic-y monkey who can't believe he is making so many friends - or earning so much fortune and fame for his master. </p> <p>His master is Paul Frank, a 32-year-old Californian designer whose name and cheesy-breezy slogan - \"Paul Frank is your friend\" - appears on the labels of Julius merchandise. Frank's graphics are inspired by skatewear and American commercial art of the 50s and 60s, and Julius the monkey is the most popular of the characters that decorate Paul Frank accessories. The label's global success is a lesson in the huge sales potential to be had from combining a clever cartoon-vision with a knack for bags and T-shirts. Frank started off hand-stitching wallets in a garage in 1995; now Paul Frank Industries employs 30 people, earns over five million dollars per year and is redefining the rules of merchandise and media. </p> <p>Frank dresses like a geek-trendy (dark denim, rugs as sideburns, Joe 90 specs) and speaks with a bizarre childlike naivety, as if he is a little terrified by his success. It's rather like talking to a character from a Belle and Sebastian song, albeit one that has relocated to Costa Mesa (near San Diego) and can afford \"fancy cars\". He had no formal design training, but took art classes after he left high school, teaching himself to draw by \"sitting in a library forcing myself to draw Huckleberry Hound over and over again\". His mom bought him a sewing machine when he was 25, because he had developed a taste for stitching extra stripes on to his Jack Purcell trainers, and his ex-girlfriend Daiquiri helped him to the next level. (They split because she thought his fame would drive them apart, but he still \"really loves\" her.) She and he would draw animals on their notes to each other and one day he drew her a monkey, based on a sock puppet his grandmother had once given him. The monkey became Julius. </p> <p>In the mid-90s, Frank was working on a newsstand in his home town, occasionally knocking things up for friends on his sewing machine. He would take backpacks and purses apart to see how they were made, then make patterns for his own. One day, he showed his friend Ryan Heuser a bag and wallet he'd made to match one of Daiquiri's dresses. Ryan, a PR for Mossimo, saw sellability; he set himself and Frank up in business, then in 1997 brought in John Oswald, an investment broker, as a third partner. (\"They protect me from business,\" Frank says. \"I can't deal with that world. I'm like a kid.\") Investment money meant Frank could quit the newsstand, go to trade fairs and employ freelance sales representatives. When the orders from Japan started coming in, they began to contract out patterns to manufacturers. They haven't looked back. </p> <p>They took Paul Frank's name for the company partly because he wanted to do homeware (his heroes are mid-century modernist furniture designers such as Charles and Ray Eames, George Nelson and Arne Jacobsen) and he thought a simple name would transfer better than a streetwear brand name. More worthily, Frank maintains a direct personal involvement in his designs; he still draws all the patterns for the bags himself, starting with cardboard models he makes at home, and each piece is designed individually according to the character appearing on it. </p> <p>He has developed a personal fan base with his eponymous position and author-like signings; he makes appearances at shops, autographing his clothes with a little monkey or giraffe and making mental notes about his audience. \"I get to meet customers at signings,\" he says, saucer-eyed, \"and it helps me know more about them. They always seem excited - I guess the monkey makes people get a nice feeling inside. It reminds us of when we were little.\" </p> <p>Which it surely does, though there are multiple layers of nostalgia in Paul Frank's work. The referencing of clean, mid-century-modern commercial graphics, and his bags evoking 60s jet-set culture, link him to a contemporary kind of kitsch (Tiki revival, New York and LA lounge clubs, the art direction of Wallpaper, the pop artist Shag) that has held sway with a certain set of twenty- and thirtysomething Americans for the past two or three years. It is this combination of cute and clever that lies at the heart of his appeal. </p> <p>As for the future, Paul Frank Industries have just opened their first stand-alone retail outlet, in Costa Mesa, and are planning more; there will be more furniture and eventually an entire lifestyle range. Frank is also painting pictures for a gallery exhibition and collaborating on some designs with Shag. The company has entered into a partnership with a new media group which will allow Frank to develop his characters into animated cartoons on 25 websites, as well as into children's books, collecting them under the umbrella title \"Julius and Friends\". Creatures such as Sir Randolph the gorilla, Clancy the giraffe, Worry Bear the polar bear and Skurvy the skull and crossbones will be given histories, personalities and voices in the first-ever example of entertainment content being developed from merchandise, rather than vice versa. </p> <p>There are rumours that TV networks are interested, too. Any deals in this regard are sure to be watched closely by a) those interested in the overlapping of the fashion and entertainment industries and b) anyone who ever thought one of their idle doodles might look good on a T-shirt.

Government leaders from Whitehall and the regions are concerned to avoid simplistic \"north-south\" thinking in their plans to pump millions of extra pounds into lagging parts of the country. Mr Wan is a perfect model for them. He signed a contract for a new Harvey Nichols store in Manchester, only the fourth outside London, and - significantly - less than 40 miles from the thriving branch in Leeds. How can this be, when Harvey Nicks has repeatedly turned down Birmingham, the home of today's summit, fearing that a Midlands store would \"cannibalise\" trade at the flagship branch in Knightsbridge, London, where plenty of wealthy Brummies have accounts? Mr Wan sums up his reasons by saying: \"people don't seem to want to cross the Pennines to shop\". In other words, there is money aplenty along the M62 corridor; wads of it in Wilmslow and bucketfuls in Boroughbridge. Absolutely not the north of cobble-and-white myth - this is a part of Britain where the economy is going at full steam. But within miles of such prosperity, there are truly alarming blackspots. Indeed, the corridor has a European Union objective 1 area dangling from either end: Merseyside and South Yorkshire, which fall into the lowest tranche of European performance and so qualify for maximum help. The fact that there is only one other objective 1 area in Britain, Cornwall, also supports New Labour's concern that the phrase \"north-south divide\" does not get overused. Simplistic doling out of money from the centre to the edges already has a deadly example in the UK - the Barnett formula, which the Treasury has used since 1978 to parcel out subsidy to Scotland and Wales. Joel (now Lord) Barnett admitted at the time that this was a back-of-a-postcard job to tackle a crisis and has recently begged for this growing embarrassment to his name to be consigned to the bin. Calculations made by a chief secretary to the Treasury 22 years ago have little or no relation with the index of need outside London in the year 2000. The only appeal of the formula is, alas, the very powerful political one of keeping Scottish and Welsh voters loyal. Mr Prescott faces the same temptation in relation to the much-talked-about Labour heartlands, especially in the north. But the signs are that the Birmingham summit will resist such a Tammany Hall approach to allocating regional funds. The people who know best where the greatest need is are the regional leaders, especially the members of the eight regional development agencies, whose chairs are they key figures at the summit. The guidance document for them, drawn up by a group including Mr Brown's right-hand man, Ed Balls of the Treasury (whose wife, Yvette Cooper MP, happens to represent the deprived constituency of Pontefract and Castleford), is reassuring about this. Its approach of setting the business-dominated regional development agencies tough targets for job-creation and inward investment sits well with what seems to be a genuine willingness to put them in charge of funding distribution within each region. London is often a useful backstop and court of appeal.

A \"league table of enterprise\" of new business start-ups per head of population showed that the seven top areas were all in the capital while the bottom five were in north-east England. The statistics confirming the north-south divide were published by Mr Prescott and Mr Brown at a Birmingham meeting to boost the role of the regional development agencies created by the government in an effort to reduce regional inequalities in the UK. Mr Prescott promised a strengthened role of regional development agencies to achieve a \"more balanced growth\" between the regions. \"We are putting new tools in the hands of the regions to create new types of development and build new and vibrant economies - putting back confidence and decision-making powers that are the springboard for future development,\" he said. \"I have long been committed to a stronger role for the English regions.

The table, which covers England, Scotland and Wales, shows far more firms registering for VAT in the south than the north. The seven leading areas for business creation were all in London, headed by the City of London, with 2,893 start-ups per 10,000 residents and the City of Westminster, with 300 start-ups per 10,000 residents. The bottom five areas were all in the north-east, with Wansbeck in Northumberland having 12 start-ups per 10,000 residents, followed by Redcar and Cleveland with 14 start-ups per 10,000 residents. The average across the UK was 40, with an average in England of 42. Publishing the table, the Treasury acknowledged: \"There are significant differences in business start-up rates across the regions of the UK and within the regions.\" But the Treasury stressed that its figures, while being the \"most precise measure\" available for new business creation, were far from perfect.

During this period, he was a member of the parliamentary scientific committee and the nuclear safety committee, and served as president of the Chemical Society. In 1942, Melville married Janet Porteous, with whom he had two daughters. Apart from chemistry and his family, he had only one lifelong passion, a compelling fascination for gadgets and new technological possibilities. These, and a huge specialised mind, made him one of the most modest, inventive and quietest giants of our time. \u0095 Sir Harry Work Melville, polymer chemist and administrator, born April 27 1908; died June 14 2000 This obituary has been updated since the author's death.",

The letter, almost certainly forged, was leaked to the Daily Mail on the eve of the 1924 general election which led to the fall of the first Labour government under Ramsay Macdonald. Purported to have been written by Grigori Zinoviev, president of the Comintern, the internal communist organisation, it called on British communists to mobilise \"sympathetic forces\" in the Labour party to support an Anglo-Soviet treaty (including a loan to the Bolshevik government) and to encourage \"agitation-propaganda\" in the armed forces. A study by Gill Bennett, chief historian at the Foreign Office, last year pointed the finger at elements in the intelligence services. She revealed that Stewart Menzies, a future head of MI6 whose allegiances, she said, \"lay firmly in the Conservative camp\", admitted sending a copy of the Zinoviev letter to the Mail. A note to the Foreign Office released yesterday and dated April 1952 says there is \"no harm whatsoever [that] some papers should be registered and some destroyed\". The letter is signed by C - or chief of MI6, as the agency's head is known. C at the time was Stewart Menzies. A further document released yesterday discloses that a Foreign Office official noted later: \"Perhaps some letters and papers have been destroyed in the past which ought to be preserved under the Public Records Act\". On October 25, 1924, four days before the election, the Mail splashed headlines across its front page claiming: Civil War Plot by Socialists' Masters: Moscow Orders To Our Reds; Great Plot Disclosed. Labour lost by a landslide. Ms Bennett said that the letter \"probably was leaked from SIS (the Secret Intelligence Service, commonly known as MI6) by somebody to the Conservative party central office\". She said MI6 was at the centre of the scandal, though there was no evidence of a conspiracy in what she called \"the institutional sense\". The security and intelligence community at the time consisted of a \"very, very incestuous circle, an elite network\" who went to school together. MI6 and Foreign Office files which have not been destroyed show the Zinoviev letter was widely circulated, including to senior army officers, to inflict maximum damage on the Labour government. She said the letter - sent to MI6 from one of its agents in the Latvian capital, Riga - was written as a result of a campaign orchestrated by White Russians who had good contacts in London. The report said there was no hard evidence that MI6 agents in Riga were directly responsible - though they had close contacts with White Russians. MI6 deceived the Foreign Office by asserting that it did know who the source was - a deception it used to claim the Zinoviev letter was genuine.

      "body": "<p><strong>Chapter one: JACK RUSSELL</strong></p> <p>On the second Sunday morning in November, the day after the Breeders' Cup at Hollywood Park (which he did not get to this year, because the trek to the West Coast seemed a long one from Westchester County and he didn't have a runner, had never had a runner, how could this possibly be his fault, hadn't he spent millions breeding, training, and running horses? Wasn't it time he had a runner in the Breeders' Cup or got out of the game altogether, one or the other?), Alexander P. Maybrick arose from his marriage bed at 6:00 a.m., put on his robe and slippers, and exited the master suite he shared with his wife, Rosalind. On the way to the kitchen, he passed the library, his office that adjoined the library, the weight room, the guest bathroom, the living room, and the dining room. In every room his wife had laid a Persian carpet of exceptional quality - his wife had an eye for quality in all things - and it seemed like every Persian carpet in every room every morning was adorned with tiny dark, dense turds deposited there by Eileen, the Jack Russell terrier. Eileen herself was nestled up in bed with his wife, apparently sleeping, since she didn't raise even her head when Mr. Maybrick arose, but Mr. Maybrick knew she was faking. No Jack Russell sleeps though movement of any kind except as a ruse. </p> <p> Mr. Maybrick had discussed this issue with Rosalind on many levels. It was not as though he didn't know what a Jack Russell was all about when Rosalind brought the dog home. A Jack Russell was about making noise, killing small animals and dragging their carcasses into the house, attacking much larger dogs, refusing to be house-trained, and in all other ways living a primitive life. Rosalind had promised to start the puppy off properly, with a kennel and a trainer and a strict routine and a book about Jack Russells, and every other thing that worked with golden retrievers and great Danes and mastiffs, and dogs in general. But Eileen wasn't a dog, she was a beast, and the trainer had been able to do only one thing with her, which was stop her from barking. And thank God for that, because if the trainer had not stopped Eileen from barking Mr. Maybrick would have had to strangle her. Rosalind, who sent her underwear to the cleaners and had the windows washed every two weeks and kept the oven spotless enough to sterilize surgical instruments, tried to take the position that the turds were small and harmless, and that the carpets could handle them, but really she just thought the dog was cute, even after Eileen learned to jump from the floor to the kitchen counters, and then walked around on them with her primevally dirty feet, click click click, right in front of Mr. Maybrick, even after Eileen began to sleep under the covers, pushing her wiry, unsoft coat right into Mr. Maybrick's nose in the middle of the night. \"Do you know where this dog has been?\" Mr. Maybrick would say to Rosalind, and Rosalind would reply, \"I don't want to think about that.\" </p> <p> Mr. Maybrick was a wealthy and powerful man, and in the end, that was what stopped him. He knew that, in the larger scheme of things, he had been so successful, and, in many ways, so unpleasant about it all (he was a screamer and a bully, tough on everyone), that Eileen had come into his life as a corrective. She weighed one-twentieth of what he did. He could crush her between his two fists. He could also get rid of her, either by yelling at his wife or by sending her off to the SPCA on his own, but he dared not. There was some abyss of megalomania that Eileen guarded the edge of for Mr. Maybrick, and in the mornings, when he walked to the kitchen to get his coffee, he tried to remember that. </p> <p> The first thing Mr. Maybrick did after he poured his coffee was to call his horse-trainer. When the trainer answered with his usual \"Hey, there!,\" Mr. Maybrick said, \"Dick!,\" and then Dick said, \"Oh. Al.\" He always said it just like that, as if he were expecting something good to happen, and Mr. Maybrick had happened instead. Mr. Maybrick ignored this and sipped his coffee while Dick punched up his response. \"Can I do something for you, Al?\" </p> <p> \"Yeah. You can put that Laurita filly in the allowance race on Thursday.\" </p> <p> \"You've got a condition book, then.\" </p> <p> \"Oh, sure. I want to know what races are being run. You trainers keep everything so dark\u0097\" </p> <p> \"Well, sure. Al, listen\u0097\" </p> <p> \"Dick, Frank Henderson thinks it's the perfect race for her. A little step up in class, but not too much competi\u0097\" </p> <p> \"I'll see.\" </p> <p> \"I want to do it. Henderson said\u0097\" </p> <p> \"Mr. Henderson\u0097\" </p> <p> \"Frank Henderson knows horses and racing, right? His filly won the Kentucky Oaks last year, right? He would have had that other horse in the sprint yesterday if it hadn't broken down. Listen to me, Dick. I shouldn't have to beg you.\" This was more or less a threat, and as he said it, not having actually intended to, Mr. Maybrick reflected upon how true it was. He was the owner. Dick Winterson was the trainer. The relationship was a simple one. Henderson was always telling him not to be intimidated by trainers. </p> <p> \"We'll see.\" </p> <p> \"You always say that. Look, I don't want to watch the Breeders' Cup on TV again next year. Henderson thinks this filly's got class.\" </p> <p> \"She does, but I want to go slow with her. We have to see how the filly\u0097\" </p> <p> Mr. Maybrick hung up. He didn't slam down the phone - he no longer did that - he simply hung up. If Dick had known him as long as Mr. Maybrick had known himself, he would haw: realized what a good thing it was, simply hanging up. And here was another thing he could use with his wife. He could say that if he didn't have to pass all those turds in the morning he could start off calmer and his capacity for accepting frustration would last a little longer. It was scientific. When they didn't have the dog, he had gotten practically to the fourth phone call without offending anyone. Now he got maybe to the second. He took another sip of his coffee, and called his broker, then his partner, then his general manager, then his other partner, then his secretary, then his broker again, then his AA sponsor (who was still in bed). This guy's name was Harold W., and he was a proctologist as well as an alcoholic. Mr. Maybrick had chosen him because he was a man of infinite patience and because he knew everything there was to know about prostate glands. </p> <p> \"I want a drink,\" said Mr. Maybrick. \"There's turds all over the house. I bet you can understand that one.\" </p> <p> \"Good morning, Al. What's really up? You haven't had a drink in two years.\" </p> <p> \"But I'm always on the verge. It's a real struggle with me.\" </p> <p> \"Say your serenity prayer.\" </p> <p> \"God\u0097\" </p> <p> \"God\u0097\" </p> <p> They said the serenity prayer together. </p> <p> \"Look,\" said Al, \"I got this pain in my groin\u0097\" </p> <p> \"No freebies.

I can't\u0097\" </p> <p> \"You need to be working on your fourth step.\" </p> <p> \"What's that one again?\" </p> <p> \"Taking a fearless inventory of your character defects.\" </p> <p> \"Oh, yeah.\" </p> <p> \"Trying to get something for nothing is one of your character defects.\" </p> <p> \"I never pay retail.\" </p> <p> \"Then you need to work on your third step, Al.\" </p> <p> \"What's that one?\" </p> <p> \"Turning your life over to your higher power.\" </p> <p> Mr. Maybrick cleared his throat, as he always did when someone said those higher-power words. Those words always made an image of Ralph Peters come into his head, the guy who used to be head of the Mercantile Exchange in Chicago, and who foiled the Hunt brothers when they tried to corner the silver market back in '80. Peters was an Austrian guy. He had \"higher power\" written all over him, and he was the last guy Mr. Maybrick had ever feared. He would never turn his life over to Peters. </p> <p> Harold went on, \"Let's think a little more about the last day. What about rage? Have you been raging?\" </p> <p> \"Well, sure. A guy in my posi\u0097\" </p> <p> \"Should be filled with gratitude. Your position is a gratitude position. Thank you, God, for every frustration, every bad deal, every monetary loss, every balk and obstacle and resistance.\" </p> <p> Harold often teased him in this way. Mr. Maybrick felt better for it, because it made him think Harold W. liked him after all, and it reminded him, too, of when his old man had been in a good mood. Joshing him. </p> <p> \"Every non-cooperator, every son of a bitch, every idiot who gets in my way, every slow driver, every\u0097\" </p> <p> \"Okay.\" </p> <p> \"I've got to go to work.\" </p> <p> \"But I\u0097There's wine in the liquor cabinet.\" </p> <p> \"Throw it out. I've got to go to work. The assholes are accumulating.\" </p> <p> Mr. Maybrick laughed. Harold W. laughed, too. Harold W. wasn't a saint, by any means. He had been in AA for thirty-two years, at a meeting almost every day. Mr. Maybrick didn't know whether to respect that or have contempt for it, but he knew for a fact that Harold W. was a force to be reckoned with, and he thanked him politely, ragelessly, and hung up the phone. </p> <p> Now Eileen trotted into the room. It was clear to Mr. Maybrick that the dog was intentionally ignoring him. She clicked over to her bowl and checked it, took a drink from the water dish, circumnavigated the cooking island, and then, casually, leapt onto the granite counter and trotted toward the sink. \"Get down, Eileen,\" said Mr. Maybrick. It was as if he hadn't spoken. Eileen cocked her little tan head and peered into the garbage disposal, noting that the stopper was in place. Her little stump of a tail flicked a couple of times, and she seemed to squat down. She stretched her paw toward the stopper, but her legs were too short; she couldn't reach it. She surveyed the situation for a moment, then went behind the sink, picked up a pinecone that had been hidden there, and jumped down. Only now did she look at Mr. Maybrick. She dropped the pinecone at his slippered feet and backed up three steps, her snapping black gaze boring into his. \"I don't want to do that, Eileen,\" he said. Her strategy was to take little steps backward and forward and then spin in a tight circle, gesturing at the pinecone with her nose. But she never made a sound. </p> <p> \"You're not a retriever, Eileen, you're a terrier. Go outside and kill something.\" </p> <p> Indeed, Eileen was a terrier, and with terrier determination, she resolved that Mr. Maybrick would ultimately throw the pinecone. She continued dancing, every few seconds picking up the pinecone and dropping it again. She was getting cuter and cuter. That was her weapon. Mr. Maybrick considered her a very manipulative animal. He looked away from her and took another sip of his (third) cup of coffee. Now she barked once, and when he looked at her, she went up on her hind legs. She had thighs like a wrestler - she seemed to float. Mr. Maybrick had often thought that a horse as athletic as this worthless dog would get into the Kentucky Derby, then the Breeders' Cup, win him ten million dollars on the track, and earn him five million a year in the breeding shed for, say, twenty years. That was $110 million; it had happened to others. He had been racing and breeding horses for eleven years, and it had never happened to him. This was just the sort of thing that made you a little resentful, and rightfully so, whatever Harold W. had to say about gratitude. He closed his eyes when he felt himself sliding: that way, beginning to count up the millions he had spent running horses and thinking about deserving. With his eyes closed, Al could hear her drop the pinecone rhythmically on the tile, chock chock chock chock, the bass, her little toenails clicking a tune around it. Didn't he deserve a really big horse? Didn't he? And then, while his eyes were still closed, dog and pinecone arrived suddenly in his lap, a hard, dense little weight but live, electric. With the shock, he nearly dropped his coffee cup, and as it was, spilled on the counter. \"God damn it!\" he shouted. Eileen jumped down and trotted away. \"Hey! Come here, Eileen,\" he said. \"Eileen!\" Eileen sheared off into the living room, and he realized that he had forgotten to let her out. Mr. Maybrick put his arms up on the table and laid his head upon them.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Chapter one: JACK RUSSELL On the second Sunday morning in November, the day after the Breeders' Cup at Hollywood Park (which he did not get to this year, because the trek to the West Coast seemed a long one from Westchester County and he didn't have a runner, had never had a runner, how could this possibly be his fault, hadn't he spent millions breeding, training, and running horses? Wasn't it time he had a runner in the Breeders' Cup or got out of the game altogether, one or the other?), Alexander P. Maybrick arose from his marriage bed at 6:00 a.m., put on his robe and slippers, and exited the master suite he shared with his wife, Rosalind. On the way to the kitchen, he passed the library, his office that adjoined the library, the weight room, the guest bathroom, the living room, and the dining room. In every room his wife had laid a Persian carpet of exceptional quality - his wife had an eye for quality in all things - and it seemed like every Persian carpet in every room every morning was adorned with tiny dark, dense turds deposited there by Eileen, the Jack Russell terrier. Eileen herself was nestled up in bed with his wife, apparently sleeping, since she didn't raise even her head when Mr. Maybrick arose, but Mr. Maybrick knew she was faking. No Jack Russell sleeps though movement of any kind except as a ruse. Mr. Maybrick had discussed this issue with Rosalind on many levels. It was not as though he didn't know what a Jack Russell was all about when Rosalind brought the dog home. A Jack Russell was about making noise, killing small animals and dragging their carcasses into the house, attacking much larger dogs, refusing to be house-trained, and in all other ways living a primitive life. Rosalind had promised to start the puppy off properly, with a kennel and a trainer and a strict routine and a book about Jack Russells, and every other thing that worked with golden retrievers and great Danes and mastiffs, and dogs in general. But Eileen wasn't a dog, she was a beast, and the trainer had been able to do only one thing with her, which was stop her from barking. And thank God for that, because if the trainer had not stopped Eileen from barking Mr. Maybrick would have had to strangle her. Rosalind, who sent her underwear to the cleaners and had the windows washed every two weeks and kept the oven spotless enough to sterilize surgical instruments, tried to take the position that the turds were small and harmless, and that the carpets could handle them, but really she just thought the dog was cute, even after Eileen learned to jump from the floor to the kitchen counters, and then walked around on them with her primevally dirty feet, click click click, right in front of Mr. Maybrick, even after Eileen began to sleep under the covers, pushing her wiry, unsoft coat right into Mr. Maybrick's nose in the middle of the night. \"Do you know where this dog has been?\" Mr. Maybrick would say to Rosalind, and Rosalind would reply, \"I don't want to think about that.\" Mr. Maybrick was a wealthy and powerful man, and in the end, that was what stopped him. He knew that, in the larger scheme of things, he had been so successful, and, in many ways, so unpleasant about it all (he was a screamer and a bully, tough on everyone), that Eileen had come into his life as a corrective. She weighed one-twentieth of what he did. He could crush her between his two fists. He could also get rid of her, either by yelling at his wife or by sending her off to the SPCA on his own, but he dared not. There was some abyss of megalomania that Eileen guarded the edge of for Mr. Maybrick, and in the mornings, when he walked to the kitchen to get his coffee, he tried to remember that. The first thing Mr. Maybrick did after he poured his coffee was to call his horse-trainer. When the trainer answered with his usual \"Hey, there!,\" Mr. Maybrick said, \"Dick!,\" and then Dick said, \"Oh. Al.\" He always said it just like that, as if he were expecting something good to happen, and Mr. Maybrick had happened instead. Mr. Maybrick ignored this and sipped his coffee while Dick punched up his response. \"Can I do something for you, Al?\" \"Yeah. You can put that Laurita filly in the allowance race on Thursday.\" \"You've got a condition book, then.\" \"Oh, sure. I want to know what races are being run. You trainers keep everything so dark\u0097\" \"Well, sure. Al, listen\u0097\" \"Dick, Frank Henderson thinks it's the perfect race for her. A little step up in class, but not too much competi\u0097\" \"I'll see.\" \"I want to do it. Henderson said\u0097\" \"Mr. Henderson\u0097\" \"Frank Henderson knows horses and racing, right? His filly won the Kentucky Oaks last year, right? He would have had that other horse in the sprint yesterday if it hadn't broken down. Listen to me, Dick. I shouldn't have to beg you.\" This was more or less a threat, and as he said it, not having actually intended to, Mr. Maybrick reflected upon how true it was. He was the owner. Dick Winterson was the trainer. The relationship was a simple one. Henderson was always telling him not to be intimidated by trainers. \"We'll see.\" \"You always say that. Look, I don't want to watch the Breeders' Cup on TV again next year. Henderson thinks this filly's got class.\" \"She does, but I want to go slow with her. We have to see how the filly\u0097\" Mr. Maybrick hung up. He didn't slam down the phone - he no longer did that - he simply hung up. If Dick had known him as long as Mr. Maybrick had known himself, he would haw: realized what a good thing it was, simply hanging up. And here was another thing he could use with his wife. He could say that if he didn't have to pass all those turds in the morning he could start off calmer and his capacity for accepting frustration would last a little longer. It was scientific. When they didn't have the dog, he had gotten practically to the fourth phone call without offending anyone. Now he got maybe to the second. He took another sip of his coffee, and called his broker, then his partner, then his general manager, then his other partner, then his secretary, then his broker again, then his AA sponsor (who was still in bed). This guy's name was Harold W., and he was a proctologist as well as an alcoholic. Mr. Maybrick had chosen him because he was a man of infinite patience and because he knew everything there was to know about prostate glands. \"I want a drink,\" said Mr. Maybrick. \"There's turds all over the house. I bet you can understand that one.\" \"Good morning, Al. What's really up? You haven't had a drink in two years.\" \"But I'm always on the verge. It's a real struggle with me.\" \"Say your serenity prayer.\" \"God\u0097\" \"God\u0097\" They said the serenity prayer together. \"Look,\" said Al, \"I got this pain in my groin\u0097\" \"No freebies. That's the rule. My partner will be happy to\u0097\" \"It's like water trickling out of a hose. I can't\u0097\" \"You need to be working on your fourth step.\" \"What's that one again?\" \"Taking a fearless inventory of your character defects.\" \"Oh, yeah.\" \"Trying to get something for nothing is one of your character defects.\" \"I never pay retail.\" \"Then you need to work on your third step, Al.\" \"What's that one?\" \"Turning your life over to your higher power.\" Mr. Maybrick cleared his throat, as he always did when someone said those higher-power words. Those words always made an image of Ralph Peters come into his head, the guy who used to be head of the Mercantile Exchange in Chicago, and who foiled the Hunt brothers when they tried to corner the silver market back in '80. Peters was an Austrian guy. He had \"higher power\" written all over him, and he was the last guy Mr. Maybrick had ever feared. He would never turn his life over to Peters.

The great Polish composer-pianist Ignacy Paderewski is the most celebrated example, having once been his country's prime minister; more recently, the Greek composer Thanos Mikroutsikos has served in the Greek cabinet, while the Estonian Lepo Sumera, who has died of heart failure aged 50, was his country's minister of culture from 1988-92, during the momentous period of independence from the Soviet Union.</p> <p>Sumera's importance to Estonia extends much further than his tenure of a relatively peripheral political post. After Heino Eller (1887-1970), whose last pupil Sumera was, and Arvo P\u00e4rt, Sumera became one of the most internationally renowned composers from his country, his works being taken up by orchestras throughout North America and Europe (though less readily in Britain), and as far afield as Australia and Cuba.</p> <p>The modern orchestra was, without doubt, his preferred medium for expression, and his six symphonies and three concertos, all written between 1981 and this year, form the backbone of his output. Only last month, his Sixth Symphony was premiered in a concert to mark his 50th birthday, as, indeed, was another new work, the Concerto Grosso, a week earlier.</p> <p>It has been suggested that the intensity of his involvement in preparing both scores for performance may have undermined his frail medical condition; he had a history of cardiac problems, and had undergone an exploratory operation some years earlier.</p> <p>Sumera's music passed through a variety of styles over the years, in the 1970s employing a free form of Schoenberg's 12-note method, as well as collage. Later, he evolved an idiom that, in common with the music of many of his compatriots, seems to embrace minimalism, but the roots for which lay not in any American model, such as Philip Glass or Steve Reich, but rather in the ancient runic songs of Estonia.</p> <p>Sumera first came to notice in 1972 with In Memoriam, his orchestral tribute to Eller. This work proved prophetic in its atmospheric orchestration and invigorating blend of various musical styles, features of later works such as the Third Symphony (1988). The five movements of his Fourth Symphony, Serena Borealis (1992), separately cover a wide range of moods - from calm quietude to unbridled ferocity; the Fifth (1995), written in one, half-hour-long movement, synthesised the disparate elements of his works of the previous decade into one of his most impressive works.</p> <p>That Sumera also had an acute ear for instrumental sonority can be heard plainly in his brooding and intense Piano Concerto (1989, revised in 1997) and Cello Concerto (1999), as well as in earlier works - such as Music For Chamber Orchestra (1977), with its enchanting flute solos, or the solo piano Piece From The Year 1981. His output also includes much chamber music, as well as cantatas, more than 50 film scores, and a multi-media opera, Olivia's Master Class (1997), in which paintings by one of the characters are displayed via video.</p> <p>In the late 1980s, Sumera became increasingly interested in electro-acoustic music, eventually founding, in 1995, the Electronic Music Studio at the Estonian Academy of Music. In 1999, his electro-acoustic work, Heart Affairs, used sounds made by the human heart - transformed electronically during performance - as well as echocardiographic images, including those of his own heart. He is credited with being the first Estonian composer to use a computer systematically for composition.</p> <p>Sumera first studied music with the composer and musicologist Veljo Tormis (whose choral music has also begun, in recent years, to have considerable international appeal), moving in 1968 to Eller's class at the then Tallinn Conservatory (now the Estonian Academy of Music). He completed his studies with Heino J\u00fcrisalu, graduating in 1973, by which time he was already working as recording director for Estonian radio, a post he relinquished in 1980 after starting a two-year postgraduate course at Moscow Conservatory.</p> <p>Sumera began teaching composition at the Estonian Academy in 1978, and was appointed profesor in 1993. His most renowned former pupil is Erkki-Sven T\u00fc\u00fcr, who delivered the oration at his funeral. He also served as chairman of the Estonian Composers' Union from 1993.</p> <p>In 1972, he married the pianist Kersti Einasto, who survives him, and with whom he had two daughters, Kadri-Ann and Eva-Maria, and a son, Tammo.

After Heino Eller (1887-1970), whose last pupil Sumera was, and Arvo P\u00e4rt, Sumera became one of the most internationally renowned composers from his country, his works being taken up by orchestras throughout North America and Europe (though less readily in Britain), and as far afield as Australia and Cuba. The modern orchestra was, without doubt, his preferred medium for expression, and his six symphonies and three concertos, all written between 1981 and this year, form the backbone of his output. Only last month, his Sixth Symphony was premiered in a concert to mark his 50th birthday, as, indeed, was another new work, the Concerto Grosso, a week earlier. It has been suggested that the intensity of his involvement in preparing both scores for performance may have undermined his frail medical condition; he had a history of cardiac problems, and had undergone an exploratory operation some years earlier. Sumera's music passed through a variety of styles over the years, in the 1970s employing a free form of Schoenberg's 12-note method, as well as collage. Later, he evolved an idiom that, in common with the music of many of his compatriots, seems to embrace minimalism, but the roots for which lay not in any American model, such as Philip Glass or Steve Reich, but rather in the ancient runic songs of Estonia. Sumera first came to notice in 1972 with In Memoriam, his orchestral tribute to Eller. This work proved prophetic in its atmospheric orchestration and invigorating blend of various musical styles, features of later works such as the Third Symphony (1988). The five movements of his Fourth Symphony, Serena Borealis (1992), separately cover a wide range of moods - from calm quietude to unbridled ferocity; the Fifth (1995), written in one, half-hour-long movement, synthesised the disparate elements of his works of the previous decade into one of his most impressive works. That Sumera also had an acute ear for instrumental sonority can be heard plainly in his brooding and intense Piano Concerto (1989, revised in 1997) and Cello Concerto (1999), as well as in earlier works - such as Music For Chamber Orchestra (1977), with its enchanting flute solos, or the solo piano Piece From The Year 1981. His output also includes much chamber music, as well as cantatas, more than 50 film scores, and a multi-media opera, Olivia's Master Class (1997), in which paintings by one of the characters are displayed via video. In the late 1980s, Sumera became increasingly interested in electro-acoustic music, eventually founding, in 1995, the Electronic Music Studio at the Estonian Academy of Music. In 1999, his electro-acoustic work, Heart Affairs, used sounds made by the human heart - transformed electronically during performance - as well as echocardiographic images, including those of his own heart. He is credited with being the first Estonian composer to use a computer systematically for composition. Sumera first studied music with the composer and musicologist Veljo Tormis (whose choral music has also begun, in recent years, to have considerable international appeal), moving in 1968 to Eller's class at the then Tallinn Conservatory (now the Estonian Academy of Music). He completed his studies with Heino J\u00fcrisalu, graduating in 1973, by which time he was already working as recording director for Estonian radio, a post he relinquished in 1980 after starting a two-year postgraduate course at Moscow Conservatory. Sumera began teaching composition at the Estonian Academy in 1978, and was appointed profesor in 1993. His most renowned former pupil is Erkki-Sven T\u00fc\u00fcr, who delivered the oration at his funeral. He also served as chairman of the Estonian Composers' Union from 1993. In 1972, he married the pianist Kersti Einasto, who survives him, and with whom he had two daughters, Kadri-Ann and Eva-Maria, and a son, Tammo.

      "body": "<p><strong>Peter Bradshaw: </strong>You play the Countess of Marshwood and you're very patrician, and also a little mischievous. Did you enjoy playing that role?</p> <p><strong>Julie Andrews: </strong>Yes I did, it was a lovely role, delicious; I'm so pleased they asked me.</p> <p><strong>PB:</strong> And lovely language: do you relish working with Noel Coward? Have you played much Noel Coward before? </p> <p><strong>JA:</strong> I've sung a lot of his songs in my career, and I did a movie called Star in which I did excerpts from a lot of the things he had written, but I haven't actually done a play in full. This is wonderful, and really it's an unknown play. </p> <p><strong>PB:</strong> What songs did you sing? </p> <p><strong>JA:</strong> I've sung so many: Mad About the Boy, 20th Century Blues, London Pride and a lot of the bitter sweet songs. </p> <p><strong>PB:</strong> Was that in cabaret? </p> <p><strong>JA:</strong> All throughout my career. In my own concert act - I even sing Don't Put Your Daughter on the Stage Mrs Worthington, in reference to myself! </p> <p><strong>PB:</strong> You have another big movie smash in London, semi-perpetually, and that's of course Sing-along-a-Sound of Music at the Prince of Wales cinema where people turn up for the chance to sing along to the lyric. It's a situationist happening now in London - it's a real phenomenon. And it's very popular, very greatly but not solely, with the gay community. I wondered what you thought of becoming a gay icon yourself? </p> <p><strong>JA:</strong> I don't think about it, truthfully. I'm thrilled if I am, I'm awfully pleased everyone is flocking to see it. It's all done in such good fun, this karaoke, and I believe the whole thing's going to America. I also think they're going to do something like Grease next. </p> <p><strong>PB:</strong> Have you been to see Sing-along-a-Sound of Music? </p> <p><strong>JA:</strong> No, but I'd love to be a fly on the wall. How do I go - as myself in disguise? </p> <p><strong>PB:</strong> Interesting question! I read somewhere that after the Queen you're the 2nd most dreamed-about person. You have this legendary status - more than celebrity status, a kind of mythic status. </p> <p><strong>JA:</strong> I think it's the size of those roles and the fact that they've been around for such a long time. </p> <p><strong>PB:</strong> Do they seem distant now? </p> <p><strong>JA:</strong> No, they don't. Actually it's because they are ever-present, they seem to keep coming around again and again, particularly Poppins and The Sound of Music, and also to some extent Victor Victoria. I'm just very glad to have been a part of those movies. </p> <p><strong>PB:</strong> What is it, do you think, about The Sound of Music that hooks into people's minds so emphatically? </p> <p><strong>JA:</strong> I think a quality of decency and goodness and innocence, perhaps. It's a rattling good story. You put religion and those beautiful mountains and children and that great music altogether and it's going to give you a lovely feeling. Also it's a brilliantly crafted movie; everything about it was done so professionally and well. It wasn't just slapped together, it was probably at that time the beginning of the end of an era of brilliantly crafted movies, and that's all come back again - for a while it was very out of fashion. </p> <p><strong>PB:</strong> I don't know if you've seen this year's Palme D'Or winner, Dancer in the Dark, which is partly based on The Sound of Music which has Catherine Deneuve and Bj\u00f6rk rehearsing the Favourite Things sequence from The Sound of Music. It's a sensational, a very controversial film and I was wondering if you'd seen it? </p> <p><strong>JA:</strong> No I haven't, and you're the first person that's talked about it. I'd love to see it. </p> <p><strong>PB:</strong> Back to Coward [and Relative Values]. It's a very British movie and perhaps specifically a very English movie. </p> <p><strong>JA:</strong> I think that's it's charm.

      "bodyText": "Peter Bradshaw: You play the Countess of Marshwood and you're very patrician, and also a little mischievous. Did you enjoy playing that role? Julie Andrews: Yes I did, it was a lovely role, delicious; I'm so pleased they asked me. PB: And lovely language: do you relish working with Noel Coward? Have you played much Noel Coward before? JA: I've sung a lot of his songs in my career, and I did a movie called Star in which I did excerpts from a lot of the things he had written, but I haven't actually done a play in full. This is wonderful, and really it's an unknown play. PB: What songs did you sing? JA: I've sung so many: Mad About the Boy, 20th Century Blues, London Pride and a lot of the bitter sweet songs. PB: Was that in cabaret? JA: All throughout my career. In my own concert act - I even sing Don't Put Your Daughter on the Stage Mrs Worthington, in reference to myself! PB: You have another big movie smash in London, semi-perpetually, and that's of course Sing-along-a-Sound of Music at the Prince of Wales cinema where people turn up for the chance to sing along to the lyric. It's a situationist happening now in London - it's a real phenomenon. And it's very popular, very greatly but not solely, with the gay community. I wondered what you thought of becoming a gay icon yourself? JA: I don't think about it, truthfully. I'm thrilled if I am, I'm awfully pleased everyone is flocking to see it. It's all done in such good fun, this karaoke, and I believe the whole thing's going to America. I also think they're going to do something like Grease next. PB: Have you been to see Sing-along-a-Sound of Music? JA: No, but I'd love to be a fly on the wall. How do I go - as myself in disguise? PB: Interesting question! I read somewhere that after the Queen you're the 2nd most dreamed-about person. You have this legendary status - more than celebrity status, a kind of mythic status. JA: I think it's the size of those roles and the fact that they've been around for such a long time. PB: Do they seem distant now? JA: No, they don't. Actually it's because they are ever-present, they seem to keep coming around again and again, particularly Poppins and The Sound of Music, and also to some extent Victor Victoria. I'm just very glad to have been a part of those movies. PB: What is it, do you think, about The Sound of Music that hooks into people's minds so emphatically? JA: I think a quality of decency and goodness and innocence, perhaps. It's a rattling good story. You put religion and those beautiful mountains and children and that great music altogether and it's going to give you a lovely feeling. Also it's a brilliantly crafted movie; everything about it was done so professionally and well. It wasn't just slapped together, it was probably at that time the beginning of the end of an era of brilliantly crafted movies, and that's all come back again - for a while it was very out of fashion. PB: I don't know if you've seen this year's Palme D'Or winner, Dancer in the Dark, which is partly based on The Sound of Music which has Catherine Deneuve and Bj\u00f6rk rehearsing the Favourite Things sequence from The Sound of Music. It's a sensational, a very controversial film and I was wondering if you'd seen it? JA: No I haven't, and you're the first person that's talked about it. I'd love to see it. PB: Back to Coward [and Relative Values]. It's a very British movie and perhaps specifically a very English movie. JA: I think that's it's charm. It's one of the those ensemble pieces that the British do so well. PB: Talking about British movies, I was wondering what you thought about the new resurgence in British movie making - very different from Noel Coward. JA: I'm thrilled. The British have always been great at making movies, but they're just so hard to get distributed and made and they cost so much. PB: Do you have any favourites, have you seen Trainspotting? JA: I love The Full Monty which is about to be a musical of course down on Broadway_ I'm very partial to some of the old British movies like The Lavender Hill Mob and I'm All Right Jack.

He said security service employees needed a system through which to pursue grievances. He added that potential whistle-blowers should be allowed to go to their MP.</p> <p>Richard Tomlinson, the renegade MI6 officer jailed for breaking the Official Secrets Act and now on the run in Italy, was prevented from taking his case to an industrial tribunal after he was sacked.</p> <p>At the government's behest, he has been expelled from France, Switzerland, and Germany, after threatening to write a book.

      "bodyText": "Robin Cook last night made a surprise intervention in the Whitehall row over the decision by Dame Stella Rimington to publish her memoirs by calling on the former head of MI5 to think again. His intervention, which came after a rare Commons debate on the security and intelligence services, contrasts with the implicit backing she received from Downing Street when her decision was leaked last month. It is all the more surprising since the foreign secretary is responsible for MI6 and GCHQ but not for MI5 which is answerable to the home secretary, Jack Straw. Whitehall officials believe the original leak - to the Sun newspaper - came from MI6 seizing the opportunity to embarrass its \"sister service\". Mr Cook told MPs he understood Dame Stella had not yet submitted her draft to a publisher. \"There is still time for her to reflect on whether it would be right for her to do so,\" he said. Mr Cook said Dame Stella's text had been submitted for scrutiny by the security agencies and she had given her agreement that nothing would be published that would \"undermine national security\" He added: \"While there may be nothing that would be of direct compromise to national security, I detect that MPs ... would wish her to reflect on the example it would set and whether it would be wise to proceed in this way.\" Tory MPs had earlier criticised her decision to write her memoirs. The government, meanwhile, was pressed to set up a special tribunal to allow officers of the three security and intelligence agencies to air their grievances. A number of Labour backbenchers also urged the government to establish a Commons select committee to monitor the agencies's work . Pressure for a special tribunal came from Tom King, the former Conservative cabinet minister and chairman of the parliamentary intelligence and security committee which meets in private, whose members are appointed by the prime minister, and whose mandate is limited. Dale Campbell-Savours, a Labour member of the committee, added his voice to the idea. He said security service employees needed a system through which to pursue grievances. He added that potential whistle-blowers should be allowed to go to their MP. Richard Tomlinson, the renegade MI6 officer jailed for breaking the Official Secrets Act and now on the run in Italy, was prevented from taking his case to an industrial tribunal after he was sacked. At the government's behest, he has been expelled from France, Switzerland, and Germany, after threatening to write a book. David Shayler, the former MI5 officer now living in Paris, has criticised the existing system whereby staff with grievances can go to a government-appointed staff counsellor. Alan Beith, Liberal Democrat deputy leader who is also a member of the King committee, told MPs the greatest difficulty the body had was in obtaining information on advice given to ministers. In a reference to the Melita Norwood spy saga - whose handling was attacked in a report by the committee last week - he said the central issue was \"who knew what and when\". He added: \"There really is no argument now that mistakes were made by the security service and by the home office, both over the failure to consult properly about non prosecution and about the handling and publication of the material.\" Earlier, Mr Straw said MI5 had learned \"a great deal\" from the affair. The ISC report said ministers were kept in the dark about Mrs Norwood's role as a spy which was minor but was exaggerated afterthe publication of a book by the former KGB officer, Vasili Mitrokhin, last year. Ann Widdecombe, the shadow home secretary said she found it \"regrettable that confessed traitors such as Melita Norwood would never be prosecuted for betraying their country\".",

The release of figures showing that 197,000 teachers, more than three-quarters of the 250,000 eligible, have put in for the award, coincided with a decision by the two largest teaching unions to take industrial action against extra administrative work. The National Union of Teachers and the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers unveiled a rare joint campaign, amounting to an effective work to rule against non-teaching tasks. They accused the government of timing the pay announcement in an attempt to overshadow their decision, though this was denied. The unions have instructed their members not to carry out a range of tasks including bulk photocopying, processing exam marks, chasing pupil absences, analysing attendance figures, administering cover, and ordering supplies. Members were told to attend only one evening meeting a week, avoid meetings which lasted more than 60 minutes, and to boycott planning meetings before school inspections. Reports should be limited to one a year per pupil, and should be no longer than 400 words per pupil and 40 words per subject. Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the NASUWT, described the \"blitz on bureaucracy\" as \"action with a halo\". A members' ballot had revealed 94.3% supported industrial action. Of about 120,000 eligible to vote, 47,190 had done so, with 45,175 in favour of action. \"The action is pupil friendly. No child will lose a single second of education.

The unions said their action was based on the Department for Education and Employment's own directives on cutting red tape. \"Those recommendations have not been fully implemented: teachers are still being asked to carry out tasks which distract from their responsibilities to their pupils. The situation can no longer be tolerated,\" said the NUT general secretary, Doug McAvoy. Ms Morris said more needed to be done to reduce bureaucracy in schools, but teachers had to accept some administrative work was inevitable. She expected most of those who had applied for the pay award to be successful. Many of the 50,000 teachers who did not apply would do so next year, she believed. The rise is for classroom teachers who do not have any formal management responsibility and have reached the top of their pay scale, currently \u00a323,958. The \u00a32,000 award is in addition to the 3.3% across-the-board rise for teachers announced in the spring, and the government expects some classroom teachers soon to be earning more than \u00a330,000. For the first time teachers' pay was being based on their success in teaching in the classroom, Ms Morris said. \"At the end of the day our aspirations for schools and parents' aspirations for their children will depend on the quality of teaching in our classrooms.

Berlin wants talks to take place by 2004 to tackle the \"big issues\", including the difficult relationship between the European Union and the nation state.</p> <p>His initiative will put Tony Blair, who is due in Berlin next week for a private meeting with the chancellor, under intense pressure at home and on the continent.</p> <p>Germany's move points to a renewed drive to persuade the union's 15 members to transfer more sovereignty to the common EU pool. Berlin is proposing the most fundamental rewriting yet of the European community's founding charter, the 1958 Treaty of Rome.</p> <p>Officials said that, as soon as the current round of reforms was completed, the chancellor wanted inter-governmental negotiations to begin to tackle \"the big issues\".</p> <p>One source said the topics would include:</p> <p>\u0095 A new EU constitution;</p> <p>\u0095 A review of the treaties on which the EU is founded;</p> <p>\u0095 Changes to the balance of power within the union; and</p> <p>\u0095 Changes to the division of responsibilities between regional authorities, national governments and EU institutions.</p> <p>Others said the talks would also have to reach a decision on creating an \"inner core\" of EU states, ready and willing to blaze a trail towards full political union.</p> <p>This was at the crux of proposals aired last month in a controversial keynote speech by Germany's foreign minister, Joschka Fischer.</p> <p>According to some sources, the new German agenda would include potentially explosive proposals for splitting the Rome treaty. Under this vision, two new treaties would be written.</p> <p>One would enshrine the EU's broad aims and principles and could be altered only by unanimous consent. The other would cover more routine, but still crucial, issues including EU voting procedures, and could be amended by a simple majority in the union's council of ministers - thus ending the British veto.</p> <p>The forum that would carry forward the changes sought by Berlin is an inter-governmental conference, which could last months or even years. Proponents want it to get under way as soon as a far more modest set of reforms - due to be approved at the union's Nice summit in December - are ratified by national parliaments.

      "bodyText": "Germany's chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, has signalled his intention to accelerate European integration. Berlin wants talks to take place by 2004 to tackle the \"big issues\", including the difficult relationship between the European Union and the nation state. His initiative will put Tony Blair, who is due in Berlin next week for a private meeting with the chancellor, under intense pressure at home and on the continent. Germany's move points to a renewed drive to persuade the union's 15 members to transfer more sovereignty to the common EU pool. Berlin is proposing the most fundamental rewriting yet of the European community's founding charter, the 1958 Treaty of Rome. Officials said that, as soon as the current round of reforms was completed, the chancellor wanted inter-governmental negotiations to begin to tackle \"the big issues\". One source said the topics would include: \u0095 A new EU constitution; \u0095 A review of the treaties on which the EU is founded; \u0095 Changes to the balance of power within the union; and \u0095 Changes to the division of responsibilities between regional authorities, national governments and EU institutions. Others said the talks would also have to reach a decision on creating an \"inner core\" of EU states, ready and willing to blaze a trail towards full political union. This was at the crux of proposals aired last month in a controversial keynote speech by Germany's foreign minister, Joschka Fischer. According to some sources, the new German agenda would include potentially explosive proposals for splitting the Rome treaty. Under this vision, two new treaties would be written. One would enshrine the EU's broad aims and principles and could be altered only by unanimous consent. The other would cover more routine, but still crucial, issues including EU voting procedures, and could be amended by a simple majority in the union's council of ministers - thus ending the British veto. The forum that would carry forward the changes sought by Berlin is an inter-governmental conference, which could last months or even years. Proponents want it to get under way as soon as a far more modest set of reforms - due to be approved at the union's Nice summit in December - are ratified by national parliaments. This is likely to take at least two years. Officials said the proposed conference could start as early as 2003. \"We want the Nice summit to create the conditions for EU expansion. But there should also be another big inter-governmental conference within a specific time limit which should deal with the big issues,\" one official said. \"It would be a logical step,\" said another, who cautioned that it would not be appropriate to table a formal proposal until after France's six-month term as holder of the the EU presidency ends in December. Reducing the scope for using national vetoes, reducing the number of EU commissioners and altering the voting weights of member states are all meant to be resolved in the next six months. Euro-enthusiasts also want the next inter-governmental conference to deal with a charter of rights. Mr Fischer argued last month that the looming enlargement of the union could paralyse decision-making if there were not a much clearer vision of where its institutions were heading. Britain, France and almost all other EU members reacted coolly to his speech, insisting that the key integration issues from the 1998 Amsterdam treaty had to be tackled first and that further debate was both premature and divisive. Germany's ambitions were clear during this week's summit at Santa Maria da Feira in Portugal, when Mr Schr\u00f6der and France's president, Jacques Chirac, upbraided Mr Blair for opposing a \"two-speed Europe\" and said that a Britain outside the single currency was already in the slow lane. In Brussels, the EU's commissioner for the inter-governmental conference, Michel Barnier of France, said Mr Schr\u00f6der was trying to placate the powerful states that make up Germany; they want the division of powers between states and the EU to be addressed soon. In London, the Conservative foreign affairs spokesman, Francis Maude, said the German idea \"gives the lie to Labour's claims that the EU is going its way\".",

Mr Barak's year-old government was rescued from 10 days of political chaos when four cabinet ministers from the ultra-orthodox Shas party withdrew their resignations, moments before the expiry of a 48-hour grace period yesterday afternoon. Their return to the fold comes with a heavy trade-off: the departure from the government of cabinet ministers from the Meretz party, which has been the most enthusiastic supporters of peace with the Palestinians during the last seven years. In the end, it came down to arithmetic. Shas, which combines Jewish fundamentalism with an ethnic pride movement for Jews of Middle Eastern origin, has 17 seats in the Israeli parliament. Meretz has 10. So Meretz, whose head-on clash with Shas over education policy started this crisis rolling 11 months ago, had to go. They tendered their resignations on Wednesday night, saying they wanted Shas back in the coalition so that Mr Barak had a government to carry on with the peace process. They also promised to continue to back his peace efforts. Meanwhile, in the western suburb of Jerusalem that is the stronghold of the Shas movement, they brought out the champagne yesterday to celebrate the departure of their enemies. But secular Israelis are sickened by the machinations of recent days, which saw a desperate Mr Barak held to ransom by his largest coalition partner. The manoeuvring has greatly damaged his image as a leader capable of shepherding his people through the hard decisions ahead. The decorated general capitulated to virtually all of Shas's demands: extra cash infusions for its religious schools, legalising its pirate radio network, and giving the party a greater say in a peace process Mr Barak once regarded as his personal preserve. Yesterday, Mr Barak shouted down the hecklers at a meeting of the Labour party central committee to say he had little choice. \"I know it pains some of our members, but I am convinced including Shas in the coalition is the right thing for the state of Israel.\" However, Palestinians say the crisis - though it leaves Mr Barak's government still alive for the difficult weeks that lie ahead - could wreck the chances for peace. \"The end of the coalition crisis comes completely at the cost of the peace process and the Palestinians,\" said Ghassan Khatib of the Jerusalem Media and Communications Centre. \"This is all bad news.

You wouldn't be far wrong to expect it around now.\" Another Irish government source said: \"Rumours are that it will go ahead before the marching season really begins next month. Leaving things to go through to July would lead to a huge dip in confidence.\" A report in yesterday's Irish News quoted \"reliable sources\" that inspection of the dumps would take place before Mr Ahtisaari went into hospital. Sinn Fein's chief negotiator, Martin McGuinness, said in Washington on Monday, when asked if opening up the dumps was linked to reforms in the RUC: \"I have more confidence that the IRA will fulfil its commitments than I have in others.\" If there are no moves to open up the dumps before the hospitalisation of Mr Athtisaari, it means that the IRA could be delaying opening up for at least another month - making it almost three months since their surprise statement on May 6. In that statement the IRA promised to allow the inspections to go ahead \"within weeks\". Meanwhile the Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, said that he was optimistic that the IRA would fulfil its commitments. Unionists remain sceptical and impatient for developments. The greatest threat to the delivery of arms by the IRA is anger in republican and nationalist circles about reform of the RUC.",

      "body": "<p>The husband of a 31-year-old woman who died shortly after giving birth to twins by caesarean section in one of London's most eminent private hospitals, yesterday won a high court battle for a coroner's inquest into her death.</p> <p>Peter Touche wants the inquest, he said, to find out \"what happened, what didn't happen that should have happened and what caused her death\" at the Portland hospital in February last year.</p> <p>The case will raise serious questions about the way private hospitals are regulated and is likely to fuel concern over plans by the health secretary, Alan Milburn, to send more NHS patients for private treatment. Mr Touche accuses the hospital, where the Duchess of York, actress Caroline Quentin and Spice girl Victoria Beckham gave birth, of standards of care that are unacceptable in the NHS.</p> <p>Laura Touche, a US citizen, graduate of Princeton University and Harvard law school, and direct descendent of president Thomas Jefferson, chose the Portland hospital for her first confinement because she wanted monthly scans, which are not available on the NHS, and a particular obstetrician for her care.</p> <p>She had a healthy, uncomplicated pregnancy followed by an elective caesarean. At 10.24pm and 10.25pm on February 6, she gave birth to two boys, Alexander and Charles. If she had been in an NHS hospital, it is alleged, Mrs Touche would have been taken to a recovery room after her surgery and monitored every 15 minutes in the first hour, followed by every 30 minutes in the next two hours. None of that happened.</p> <p>\"Laura's vital observations, crucially her blood pressure, were not monitored at all until two and a half hours after the operation and then only after she complained of a very severe headache,\" her husband, from Chelsea, west London, said yesterday.</p> <p>Her blood pressure was high and eventually she was given drugs to bring it down.

      "bodyText": "The husband of a 31-year-old woman who died shortly after giving birth to twins by caesarean section in one of London's most eminent private hospitals, yesterday won a high court battle for a coroner's inquest into her death. Peter Touche wants the inquest, he said, to find out \"what happened, what didn't happen that should have happened and what caused her death\" at the Portland hospital in February last year. The case will raise serious questions about the way private hospitals are regulated and is likely to fuel concern over plans by the health secretary, Alan Milburn, to send more NHS patients for private treatment. Mr Touche accuses the hospital, where the Duchess of York, actress Caroline Quentin and Spice girl Victoria Beckham gave birth, of standards of care that are unacceptable in the NHS. Laura Touche, a US citizen, graduate of Princeton University and Harvard law school, and direct descendent of president Thomas Jefferson, chose the Portland hospital for her first confinement because she wanted monthly scans, which are not available on the NHS, and a particular obstetrician for her care. She had a healthy, uncomplicated pregnancy followed by an elective caesarean. At 10.24pm and 10.25pm on February 6, she gave birth to two boys, Alexander and Charles. If she had been in an NHS hospital, it is alleged, Mrs Touche would have been taken to a recovery room after her surgery and monitored every 15 minutes in the first hour, followed by every 30 minutes in the next two hours. None of that happened. \"Laura's vital observations, crucially her blood pressure, were not monitored at all until two and a half hours after the operation and then only after she complained of a very severe headache,\" her husband, from Chelsea, west London, said yesterday. Her blood pressure was high and eventually she was given drugs to bring it down. At 4am, her speech became slurred and she was vomiting constantly. At 5.30am she started suffering fits. A brain haemorrhage was confirmed and she was transferred to the NHS-run national hospital for neurology and neurosurgery, where she died nine days later. The Portland has since told her family there is no protocol concerning the monitoring and care of a woman who has just had a caesarean section, as there is in the NHS. In the high court judgment yesterday, Lord Justice Kennedy quoted a letter from the Touche family's solicitors, Alexander Harris, to the inner north London coroner which asked for an inquest to be held. \"We have expert advice to the fact that every NHS hospital in the country has a protocol in place for the care of patients in the post-operative phase,\" it said. A consultant anaesthetist with an interest in obstetrics, David Bogod, who investigated Mrs Touche's care, said the failure to monitor her blood pressure when she was receiving pain relief after an operation was astonishing, \"and described the level of neglect as 'starkly apparent',\" said Lord Justice Kennedy. There was a further report from Dr Williams, who runs the high risk obstetrics services at the NHS Chelsea and Westminster hospital. \"Like everyone else, including the coroner, he is critical of the lack of post-operative observation,\" says the judgment. Dr Williams considered that Mrs Touche's raised blood pressure was responsible for her brain haemorrhage. His report \"does seem to provide clear grounds for suspecting that the post-operative failure to monitor and treat was an effective cause of death\". The court ruled that the coroner must hold an inquest, even though the death was not violent, sudden or of an unknown cause. Mr Touche, an accountant who is the grandson of the founder of the Deloitte Touche empire, said: \"One of the reasons I'm going through this is not just because of my anger, but because this could happen again. Mistakes will happen everywhere but this wasn't a mistake - it was a total omission. There is no system of care there.\" His twin sons, he said, \"are doing very well and are very happy bundles of energy. They are a wonderful source of joy.\" He was fortunate that he was able to take time off from his work to look after them, although he had the help of a nanny five days a week. How to tell them about their mother was on his mind. \"I want to ensure that Laura's memory is very much alive, that they grow up getting to know their mother and all her faults and the great things about her.\" To those who now consider private health care, \"I would say listen to this story and all the other stories they can find out about. Find out what should be happening and make sure it is happening.\"",

Allied Zurich was among the worst performers, falling 35p to 762p as house broker Cazenove cut its recommendation to \"reduce'' from \"buy'' and slashed its price target by 15% to 850p. Among the smaller stocks, games maker Eidos edged 20p lower to 496p as talk of firm bid developments faded. Cosmetics chain Body Shop benefited from a 6% increase in sales in the first quarter to close up 2p at 128.5p. Beleaguered shareholders in troubled computer group Gresham had something to smile about - the shares have lost 60% of their value since the start of the year but climbed 22% to 36p.",

But, influenced by its recent listening to churches consultation, his party has quietly begun to promote a greater role in welfare for charities and the voluntary sector. Compassionate Communities, a consultation paper from the Conservative Christian Fellowship, argues: \"There is increasing recognition that government does not have adequate answers to some of this country's deepest problems.\" Despite the government's partnership \"rhetoric\", the paper said, \"charitable vision is suffocated by the overwhelming embrace of the bear-like state\".</p> <p>The question for Mr Hague and his new shadow cabinet sub-committee on faith-based welfare is how far his party can reconcile such conclusions and still insist it will protect the existing social safety net.</p> <p>Labour strategists believe that, as he seeks to carve out a distinctive electoral manifesto, the Tory leader will incline more towards the Olasky vision of a diminished state than the traditional British model.</p> <p>There are signs that Mr Hague may opt to steer his party towards a US-style position which would see policy influences translated into a direct political appeal to the religious vote.</p> <p>The Conservative Christian Fellowship, which Mr Hague relocated within Tory central office, has links with the US religious right, including meetings with the powerful lobby group, the Christian Coalition.</p> <p>Mr Hague, an irregular churchgoer but self-proclaimed Christian, has this year made high profile efforts to appeal directly to evangelical Christians, addressing an 8,000-strong audience at the evangelical spring harvest festival and promising to support anti-poverty projects denied government funds because they are religiously-based.</p> <p>This spring, he appealed in a Roman Catholic journal for support on the basis of policies to promote marriage and the family, while he has subsequently spoken of his opposition to abortion.</p> <p>The Tories are making overt pitches for the religious vote, according to Jonathan Bartley, general secretary of the cross-party Movement for Christian Democracy. But, he added, the Christian Socialist Movement, which Tony Blair joined in 1991, has also been angered at the \"thin veneer\" of ethical socialism rather than \"authentic Christian thought\" informing government agendas.</p> <p>Both main parties are talking up links with faith groups out of pragmatism, he argues, with the rhetorical arms race over asylum policy betraying a lack of true Christian values. Churches and faith groups must press to ensure parties take on board a new agenda highlighting international development and social justice.</p> <p>Even if the faith groups do not seek to influence government, they can be sure political parties are working out how best to use them - and the votes of their believers.</p> <p><b>Charitable deeds</b></p> <p>Faith groups which have impressed ministers:</p> <p>\u0095 Jubilee 2000 - mainly church-led campaign to write off third world debt.

A religion and welfare conference addressed by a bearded Texan professor and Treasury minister Stephen Timms might not be expected to create waves amid the Westminster bustle. But, with William Hague importing elements of US Republicanism's so-called \"compassionate conservatism\" in an overt pitch for a British spiritual vote, the combustible mix of faith and politics is back on the agenda. The Tory leader has made much of his meeting this week with Marvin Olasky, an advocate of \"Bible-based free market economics\" and adviser to the Republican presidential candidate, George W Bush, on welfare and faith-based programmes. Government's cannot, by definition, be compassionate, the professor argues, since compassion requires the giver to have a sense of personal involvement with the receiver, and an impetus that they improve their lot rather than become dependent. Labour, in turn, has derided the partnership, pointing to Prof Olasky's suggestions that the state should hand responsbility for welfare provision to church and community organisations, and that feminism and working women are to blame for \"great sexual irresponsibility\" and the \"marginalisation\" of children. Mr Timms yesterday condemned the professor's views as \"repugnant\". Behind the exchanging of insults lies a combination of political manoeuvering and a genuine debate over the role of faith groups in delivering welfare support to Britain's poorest communities. Tony Blair's government, primarily through programmes driven by its cross departmental social exclusion unit, is increasingly involving churches and other faith-based community groups in efforts to regenerate deprived areas, picking up on what Mr Timms called a \"new faith-based social activism\". Representatives of the five largest faith communities in England sit on the inner cities religious council, a forum set up by the Conservatives in 1992 and based within the Department of Environment Transport and the Regions to feed \"faith perspectives\" into regeneration policy. The key difference between such moves and the ideas of Prof Olasky, according to ministers, is that Labour favours partnership with faith-based organisations but dismisses the idea that such links could replace the role of government. Yesterday, Frank Field, Labour MP, welfare expert and churchgoer, underlined the difficulties of importing US theories when he challenged Prof Olasky's proposition that, given \u00a3100 to spend on doing good, the vast majority would send it to a charity or local organisation rather than the government.

The question for Mr Hague and his new shadow cabinet sub-committee on faith-based welfare is how far his party can reconcile such conclusions and still insist it will protect the existing social safety net. Labour strategists believe that, as he seeks to carve out a distinctive electoral manifesto, the Tory leader will incline more towards the Olasky vision of a diminished state than the traditional British model. There are signs that Mr Hague may opt to steer his party towards a US-style position which would see policy influences translated into a direct political appeal to the religious vote. The Conservative Christian Fellowship, which Mr Hague relocated within Tory central office, has links with the US religious right, including meetings with the powerful lobby group, the Christian Coalition. Mr Hague, an irregular churchgoer but self-proclaimed Christian, has this year made high profile efforts to appeal directly to evangelical Christians, addressing an 8,000-strong audience at the evangelical spring harvest festival and promising to support anti-poverty projects denied government funds because they are religiously-based. This spring, he appealed in a Roman Catholic journal for support on the basis of policies to promote marriage and the family, while he has subsequently spoken of his opposition to abortion. The Tories are making overt pitches for the religious vote, according to Jonathan Bartley, general secretary of the cross-party Movement for Christian Democracy. But, he added, the Christian Socialist Movement, which Tony Blair joined in 1991, has also been angered at the \"thin veneer\" of ethical socialism rather than \"authentic Christian thought\" informing government agendas. Both main parties are talking up links with faith groups out of pragmatism, he argues, with the rhetorical arms race over asylum policy betraying a lack of true Christian values. Churches and faith groups must press to ensure parties take on board a new agenda highlighting international development and social justice. Even if the faith groups do not seek to influence government, they can be sure political parties are working out how best to use them - and the votes of their believers. Charitable deeds Faith groups which have impressed ministers: \u0095 Jubilee 2000 - mainly church-led campaign to write off third world debt. It helped to persuade Gordon Brown to cancel debts to Britain from the world's poorest countries \u0095 Pecan project in Peckham, south London. The Peckham Evangelical Churches Action Network played a big role in the government new deal programme in Southwark; now involved in the employment action zone, helping to cut unemployment. \u0095 Bethany Trust in Edinburgh. Housed in an old chapel building, the charity works with homeless people, accommodating more than 120. Workers meet homeless people on the streets, offering food, shelter and support. \u0095 Victory Outreach in London, Manchester and Dublin. A church-based project, whose staff go on streets to help drug users and prostitutes. Clients must sign up to programme focused on prayer, Bible study and church attendance.",

      "bodyText": "Peter Martin's complaint about the takeover of Bass by Interbrew (Letters, June 19) completely misses the point that it is not governments that bring about changes but individuals with the foresight and skill to organise. His survey shows that 99% of people do not like theme pubs. Why don't they get off their bums and join the Campaign for Real Ale? It beats bleating any day. Martin might also like to know that small brewers here in East Anglia have set up a system of exchange with brewers in the south of England. No cask ever travels empty in either direction. All these small brewers are actually expanding production at the expense of the big brewers. These small brewers would have to wait until the next millennium for the government to assist them. Mike Harvey Treasurer, Colchester and North East Essex Camra \u0095 Peter Martin's disparaging remarks on the quality of European drinks and drinking places require some comment. Interbrew's two most widely available imported beers in the UK (Stella Artois is brewed here under licence) are Hoegaarden (5.5% alcohol) and Leffe (6%), both stronger and more distinctive than the unpleasant watery liquids served as \"real ales\" in the average pub. As well as welcoming availability of more continental brands, I hope that metric measures will follow shortly. With 250ml and 500ml glasses it will be possible to enjoy a drink without having its contents spilled everywhere. This small move to European drinking habits will go a long way to making our pubs more pleasant places by removing the smell of stale spilt beer. Michael J Cope Dorking, Surrey",

      "bodyText": "I spent much of the 70s filming for television in Latin America and witnessed first hand the mayhem that the US-supported dictatorships wreaked on the countries of that continent. Those regimes killed tens of thousands, tortured and traumatised many more and destroyed communities, all in the name of the fight against communism. The articles by Duncan Campbell and Isabel Hilton on Colombia and the guerrilla struggle there are a vital reminder of what is at stake (Heart of Darkness, June 19; Colombians do not need help like this, June 21). The US is using its war on drugs as a fig leaf for its war against a peasant army that craves peace and an end to the rampages of the death squads. The CIA in the Reagan years, under the direction of Oliver North, used Costa Rica as a transit camp for drug shipments to the US. The proceeds went to fund its clandestine war against the Sandinistas. Its then protege, General Manuel Noriega of Panama, was one of its middle men. Without a ready US market for drugs, there would be no production in Latin America, but in a world of so-called free markets, these poor people are simply showing the capitalist enterprise and initiative so lauded by their big brother in the north. The European Union must unequivocally reject any support for US machinations in Colombia if an ethical foreign policy is to have any meaning at all. John Green London \u0095The prospect of the US launching a new Vietnam campaign in Colombia is enough to make almost anyone start to sympathise for the other side. However, Duncan Campbell would do well to remember that just because the Farc's sworn enemies are in many cases as unpleasant as they are - an army tarnished by human rights abuses, paramilitary groups whose murderous excesses surpass even the guerrillas', a corrupt (albeit elected) government - this does not make them revolutionary heroes. When they are not watching US television and holding touchingly earnest discussions of current affairs round the campfire, the guerrillas are ruthless killers and extortionists. They are succeeding in making normal economic life impossible and are helping to drive anyone with an education out of the country. They are relics of the Soviet era and represent virtually no one but themselves, cynically drawing upon a tradition of rural revolt against central government to drum up recruits for their outmoded ideological struggle. And if they are so interested in education and welfare, why have they repeatedly destroyed schools, clinics and infrastructure built by the government to improve rural conditions? Sadly, their entry into the drug trade means they are likely to be able to fund their war for another few decades, raising the prospect of Colombia becoming the Angola of the Americas.

To Robert Gerard, the former Morgan Stanley investment banker who advised the subway in the 1970s, it was this ability to raise money through such loans that \"contributed to a virtual 100% increase in passenger traffic. </p> <p>Another important factor was the creation of a regional transportation authority to unite subways, buses and commuter railways under the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Now an academic in London, Mr Gerard believes the ability to raise the money through bonds was made possible by the fact that the MTA also had control of the seven bridges and two tunnels which connect Manhattan with the other suburbs in New York. </p> <p>All the links charge a $3.50 toll on motorists - to cover the upkeep of the bridges, leaving a stream of money which can be used for other purposes. \"This is a direct analogy to the [planned] congestion charge for driving into central London,\" he said. </p> <p>The MTA also receives money from taxes levied on New York residents, whose phone bills, for instance, contain a line detailing the tax paid on long-distance calls. Other contributions include tax New Yorkers pay when they move house and on petrol. \"Various elements of those tax streams are dedicated to some of the bonds we float. They provide revenue streams for our bonds,\" said Christopher Boylan deputy executive director of the MTA. </p> <p>At federal level the system receives approximately $700m each year, purely for capital purposes, and a $105m contribution towards running costs from New York city funds. Mr Boylan, however, said he is \"proud\" to be able to claim that the $1.50 flat fare on the subway covers 65 to 75% of the average ride. \"We used to rely on taxes much more heavily.\" Commuters with experience of both tube and the subway feel that the New York version is more reliable and less of a cattle truck. </p> <p>Most New York residents seem prepared to use it, day or night. \"I feel as safe at 4am as I do in commuting time,\" said a woman investment banker. London commuters cannot contemplate such early-hours rides as the tubes stop running around 12.30 am.</p> <p>Mr Boylan produced statistics that show that \"felonies\" have fallen dramatically, even in the last six years. In the months of January to May, 3,400 crimes were reported in 1994. This year, the figure was closer to 1,600. He is at pains to explain that the MTA does not run an operating profit - as the tube does, reporting around \u00a3250m a year. </p> <p>And while the arguments rumble on in London about how to fund improvements, New York is already able to claim progress. In contrast to other parts of the US where 85% of commuters travel to work each day by car, in New York four out of five use public transport, subway, bus or commuter rail. More commuters in New York travel on buses and trains in the city than all the rest of the country's subways and railways combined. In London, even finding the statistic for use of public transport involves much searching between public departments.</p>",

Another important factor was the creation of a regional transportation authority to unite subways, buses and commuter railways under the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Now an academic in London, Mr Gerard believes the ability to raise the money through bonds was made possible by the fact that the MTA also had control of the seven bridges and two tunnels which connect Manhattan with the other suburbs in New York. All the links charge a $3.50 toll on motorists - to cover the upkeep of the bridges, leaving a stream of money which can be used for other purposes. \"This is a direct analogy to the [planned] congestion charge for driving into central London,\" he said. The MTA also receives money from taxes levied on New York residents, whose phone bills, for instance, contain a line detailing the tax paid on long-distance calls. Other contributions include tax New Yorkers pay when they move house and on petrol. \"Various elements of those tax streams are dedicated to some of the bonds we float. They provide revenue streams for our bonds,\" said Christopher Boylan deputy executive director of the MTA. At federal level the system receives approximately $700m each year, purely for capital purposes, and a $105m contribution towards running costs from New York city funds. Mr Boylan, however, said he is \"proud\" to be able to claim that the $1.50 flat fare on the subway covers 65 to 75% of the average ride. \"We used to rely on taxes much more heavily.\" Commuters with experience of both tube and the subway feel that the New York version is more reliable and less of a cattle truck. Most New York residents seem prepared to use it, day or night. \"I feel as safe at 4am as I do in commuting time,\" said a woman investment banker. London commuters cannot contemplate such early-hours rides as the tubes stop running around 12.30 am. Mr Boylan produced statistics that show that \"felonies\" have fallen dramatically, even in the last six years. In the months of January to May, 3,400 crimes were reported in 1994. This year, the figure was closer to 1,600. He is at pains to explain that the MTA does not run an operating profit - as the tube does, reporting around \u00a3250m a year. And while the arguments rumble on in London about how to fund improvements, New York is already able to claim progress. In contrast to other parts of the US where 85% of commuters travel to work each day by car, in New York four out of five use public transport, subway, bus or commuter rail. More commuters in New York travel on buses and trains in the city than all the rest of the country's subways and railways combined. In London, even finding the statistic for use of public transport involves much searching between public departments.",

      "bodyText": "Japan, France and Denmark have scuppered an international agreement to loosen the strings attached to Third World aid donations by rich industrialised nations, prompting the government to accuse them of putting narrow financial interests ahead of effective development policies. After a two-day emergency meeting in Paris, members of the development assistance committee of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development failed to reach an agreement on untying aid to the world's poorest 48 countries despite the support of 18 of the 21 members represented. The accord would have committed OECD members to abolishing by the end of next year long-standing requirements that much of the aid they provide be spent on goods and services purchased from suppliers in their own countries. Clare Short, the secretary of state for international development, said: \"We deeply regret that members of the DAC [development assistance committee] have failed to reach a consensus on proposals for untying financial aid. We have done our best to seek consensus, for example by accepting that other categories of aid would not be covered at least at the outset. \"It's highly regrettable that narrow considerations of self interest have prevented an agreement which would have made it much easier for developing countries to access aid on a harmonised basis free from commercial distortions. This demonstrates very clearly the ulterior motives behind aid which prevent it being spent on poverty reducation.\" Ms Short will now press for the practice of tied aid, attacked by the World Bank and development charities as wasteful, selfish and anti-competitive, to be put on the main agenda at next month's Group of Eight summit in Okinawa, embarrassing the Japanese hosts who are planning to discuss how globalisation can be made to work for the poor. Japan's reservations stem from fears that its technical consultancy companies will lose out if they are forced to compete for aid contracts in an open market, undermining domestic political support for aid spending, while both France and Denmark are also concerned about the potential loss of business at a time when so much of their aid is tied. Jeff Chinnock of Action Aid said: \"It is an utter disgrace that rich countries, who claim that they are trying to tackle extreme poverty, cannot take even the smallest step towards reducing the commercial abuse of their aid programmes.

Mr Cross acknowledged that Mr Mugabe, whose term runs until 2002, had the right under the constitution to appoint a minority government and rule by decree if he lost control of parliament. \"But it would be tantamount to a coup and I don't think South Africa will accept it. They can cut his electricity and oil at any time.\" Mr Mugabe has the right to appoint 30 members to the parliament, and only 120 constituencies are being contested this weekend. If the MDC were to win more than 60 seats but less than 76, \"Mugabe might try to hang on to power, but we would block his budget,\" Mr Cross warned. Mr Tsvangirai was less ebullient about the imminence of Mr Mugabe's departure, but he was confident the MDC ought to win more than half the contested seats. \"Any result that does not give the MDC a majority will have been seriously rigged,\" Mr Tsvangirai said. The candidates' agents as well as independent monitors from local civic groups will be able to stay with the ballot boxes at night on the two polling days to ensure there is no tampering, the government-appointed chairman of the election directorate, Dr Mariyawanda Nzuwa, said yesterday. However, the MDC has expressed concern about the security of the boxes when they are later taken to the counting centre. The Legal Resources Foundation yesterday made an urgent application to the supreme court to overturn a ruling that election monitors cannot accompany the boxes.",

      "body": "<p>Mike Tyson loves Frank Warren but sometimes he does not like himself very much. And he enjoys hurting people. Really likes it a lot. But no, sir, he did not try to throw Frank Warren out of a window. Why not? Because there's a long line ahead of him.</p> <p>Two days before he enters the ring at Hampden Park, Mike Tyson spent yesterday parrying questions on his behaviour outside of it.</p> <p>At an often farcical press conference in his Glasgow hotel, the heavyweight boxer was pressed on newspaper allegations that he had assaulted Mr Warren, the fight promoter, over an unpaid jewellery bill.</p> <p>It emerged yesterday that lawyers for the jewellers, Graff Diamonds, had started high court proceedings over the bill for $630,000 (\u00a3429,000). Graff says Tyson has had the jewellery since January, when he bought it on his last visit to Britain, but it has not received a penny. A statement from Anthony Kerman, of Kerman &amp; Co solicitors, said: \"Tyson is saying Warren promised to pay for the jewellery, while Warren is denying this and saying Tyson is liable.\" A number of newspaper reports, meanwhile, have alleged that Tyson attacked Mr Warren in London after learning of the court action.</p> <p>Asked yesterday if he had assaulted Mr Warren, Tyson replied: \"I love Frank Warren.\"</p> <p>\"So you didn't try to throw him out of a window?\" asked a journalist. \"No, sir,\" said Tyson.</p> <p>\"Why not?\"asked another reporter, to gales of laughter.</p> <p>\"Because there's a long line ahead of him,\" said Tyson.</p> <p>Mr Warren was not present at yesterday's media event. His spokesman, Bernie Dillon, said his company, Sports Network, was preparing writs against a number of publications for \"false and libellous\" statements.</p> <p>\"Mr Warren is at home right now, dealing with several legal matters,\" he said. \"We delayed the press conference so he might attend but he missed the flight.\"</p> <p>Earlier, a broadcast journalist said he was forcibly removed from the press conference after asking for Tyson's reaction to the outrage among Scottish politicians and women's organisations at his arrival in the country. \"I love them all, and so does God,\" said Tyson. The question was almost drowned out by abuse from boxing supporters in the room.</p> <p>Appearing often distracted, Tyson picked at a logo on his baseball cap and made what appeared to be an obscene gesture when his opponent on Saturday, Lou Savarese, greeted members of the US press corps.</p> <p>Asked how he felt about the public's opinion of him, Tyson replied: \"I never cared about the public. I enjoy doing what I do. I enjoy hurting people. I really like it a lot.\" It did not matter that he was not more popular. \"I sometimes don't like myself, so I can understand them not liking me.\"</p> <p>Tyson was happy with his reception in Scotland. \"It does not matter if I don't understand the dialect. I understand their heart and their heart is for me.\" Earlier, he had emerged from a nearby gym, donned a kilt and danced on his Mercedes car. Glasgow, however, has appeared to be underwhelmed by the Tyson bandwagon. Since his arrival in the city on Wednesday night only a few fans have turned up at the Hilton hotel to see him.</p> <p>\"I have been surprised there's not more people here,\" said Andrew Diamond, 16, from Finnieston, who had been waiting four hours for a glimpse of the boxer. \"I thought there would have been crowds here, like there was in London.\"</p> <p>Another onlooker, Billy McGregor, 38, a taxi driver, was greeted by Tyson as he left the hotel. \"He's a lot smaller than I thought he would be,\" Mr McGregor said.</p> <p>Women's groups confirmed yesterday they will stage a protest at the fight. Sandy Brindley, of the Glasgow rape crisis centre, which was unsuccessful in a legal attempt to have Tyson blocked from entering Britain, said: \"We had decided not to do anything but we were contacted by so many people wanting to show their concern that we are going ahead.\"</p> <p>The centre has been inundated with offers of financial and other support after it emerged that Mr Warren planned to try to recoup the costs of the court case initiated by the centre. The question of costs will be decided at a court hearing next month.</p>",

Two days before he enters the ring at Hampden Park, Mike Tyson spent yesterday parrying questions on his behaviour outside of it. At an often farcical press conference in his Glasgow hotel, the heavyweight boxer was pressed on newspaper allegations that he had assaulted Mr Warren, the fight promoter, over an unpaid jewellery bill. It emerged yesterday that lawyers for the jewellers, Graff Diamonds, had started high court proceedings over the bill for $630,000 (\u00a3429,000). Graff says Tyson has had the jewellery since January, when he bought it on his last visit to Britain, but it has not received a penny. A statement from Anthony Kerman, of Kerman &amp; Co solicitors, said: \"Tyson is saying Warren promised to pay for the jewellery, while Warren is denying this and saying Tyson is liable.\" A number of newspaper reports, meanwhile, have alleged that Tyson attacked Mr Warren in London after learning of the court action. Asked yesterday if he had assaulted Mr Warren, Tyson replied: \"I love Frank Warren.\" \"So you didn't try to throw him out of a window?\" asked a journalist. \"No, sir,\" said Tyson. \"Why not?\"asked another reporter, to gales of laughter. \"Because there's a long line ahead of him,\" said Tyson. Mr Warren was not present at yesterday's media event. His spokesman, Bernie Dillon, said his company, Sports Network, was preparing writs against a number of publications for \"false and libellous\" statements. \"Mr Warren is at home right now, dealing with several legal matters,\" he said. \"We delayed the press conference so he might attend but he missed the flight.\" Earlier, a broadcast journalist said he was forcibly removed from the press conference after asking for Tyson's reaction to the outrage among Scottish politicians and women's organisations at his arrival in the country. \"I love them all, and so does God,\" said Tyson. The question was almost drowned out by abuse from boxing supporters in the room. Appearing often distracted, Tyson picked at a logo on his baseball cap and made what appeared to be an obscene gesture when his opponent on Saturday, Lou Savarese, greeted members of the US press corps. Asked how he felt about the public's opinion of him, Tyson replied: \"I never cared about the public. I enjoy doing what I do. I enjoy hurting people. I really like it a lot.\" It did not matter that he was not more popular. \"I sometimes don't like myself, so I can understand them not liking me.\" Tyson was happy with his reception in Scotland. \"It does not matter if I don't understand the dialect. I understand their heart and their heart is for me.\" Earlier, he had emerged from a nearby gym, donned a kilt and danced on his Mercedes car. Glasgow, however, has appeared to be underwhelmed by the Tyson bandwagon. Since his arrival in the city on Wednesday night only a few fans have turned up at the Hilton hotel to see him. \"I have been surprised there's not more people here,\" said Andrew Diamond, 16, from Finnieston, who had been waiting four hours for a glimpse of the boxer. \"I thought there would have been crowds here, like there was in London.\" Another onlooker, Billy McGregor, 38, a taxi driver, was greeted by Tyson as he left the hotel. \"He's a lot smaller than I thought he would be,\" Mr McGregor said. Women's groups confirmed yesterday they will stage a protest at the fight. Sandy Brindley, of the Glasgow rape crisis centre, which was unsuccessful in a legal attempt to have Tyson blocked from entering Britain, said: \"We had decided not to do anything but we were contacted by so many people wanting to show their concern that we are going ahead.\" The centre has been inundated with offers of financial and other support after it emerged that Mr Warren planned to try to recoup the costs of the court case initiated by the centre. The question of costs will be decided at a court hearing next month.",

      "bodyText": "The Japanese prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, was accused of being \"married to the mob\" yesterday as the political temperature picked up ahead of Sunday's general election. Mr Mori, whose verbal gaffes have made him one of the most unpopular prime ministers in the country's history, suffered the latest blow to his image when he admitted attending a wedding reception for the son of a former gangland boss. The scandal came only a day after Mr Mori provoked derision by suggesting that those who had not made up their mind on how to vote by Sunday morning should stay in bed all day. It provided fresh fuel to the opposition, which is trailing a long way behind the ruling Liberal Democratic party and its coalition allies in pre-election polls. The mob allegations were made in the Shukan Bunshun weekly magazine, which said Mr Mori had taken a prominent role as a nakodo\" (intermediary between the bride and groom) at the ceremony in 1996. An unnamed guest told the magazine that Mr Mori had given a speech in which he boasted of \"personal ties with the father of the groom\", a 59-year-old property developer who once led a crime syndicate in Fukuoka in southern Japan. The prime minister acknowledged being present at the event, but he said he was unaware of the background of the former gangster and had no connections with him. \"The fact that the report came out during an election campaign suggests certain motives,\" Mr Mori said in a counterattack against the magazine. This is not the first time that Mr Mori has been linked to the yakuza.. Last month, Shukan Bunshun revealed that he had given a speech at a wedding in 1995 that was attended by Yuko Inagawa, head of one of Japan's biggest crime syndicates. Mr Mori said he had not checked the guest-list in advance. According to the Asahi newspaper, Mr Mori also received a donation of more than 1m yen (\u00a36,000) from a construction firm with close ties to the mob. Accusations of gangster connections are nothing new for the conservative LDP. Former prime ministers have used the yakuza to intimidate opponents and four years ago there was an outcry when the LDP used public funds to bail out mortgage firms, many of which were run by crime syndicates. Mr Mori's ratings have been under 20% since he described Japan as a \"divine nation with the emperor at its core\" - a phrase reminiscent of the country's pre-war militarism. The impact of the scandal on the election in uncertain. The LDP - which has deliberately avoided showing its unpopular leader on TV campaign commercials - holds a strong lead and is expected to extend its almost unbroken 45-year grip on power. The only likelihood of an upset is if the huge number of undecided voters - about half of the electorate - use the ballot to express their disapproval of the prime minister.",

Olasky is an old time, American, rightwing, bible-belt fruitcake, who thinks women unsuited to office, called Jews members of the Church of Zeus, is anti-abortion and blames the personalities of the poor for their plight.

Tony Blair tried it on with the WI but they wouldn't be corralled. Now Hague is trying to lasso the religious - and risks getting the same response from most of them. In an article in the Times this week, he praised Olasky and his works, oozed with unction about \"values\" and \"a still, small voice that speaks quietly\" against bad things. He deplored the \"disregard for the faith dimension in national life and failure to promote the family\". It was a carefully crafted appeal. Just as he annexes anti-asylum seeker sentiment by raising the question without quite saying anything blatantly racist, so he tries the same trick with the religious. He doesn't, of course, say that he will be abandoning the welfare state to rely instead on religious charities: as a former social security minister he knows quite well it's all rubbish. (Under Mrs Thatcher, despite her exhortation to charities to take the welfare burden from the state, donations to charity fell sharply in her selfish there-is-no-such-thing-as-society years.) But he says just enough to try to plant his flag among what he thinks is the core religious vote. All this is preposterous stuff. Yet again the Tories make the serious mistake of looking to America for ideology and especially welfare ideas, where there are none to be had of relevance to our European traditions. Michael Portillo also made a speech this week extolling the American social way versus the European social model, laying out that choice. How these younger Tories yearn to be republicans, apeing and mouthing the delicious ideas of the US far right, but how badly they miss the British mood when they try it on.

William Hague should have examined the latest Mori figures. This is what they show: only 26% of the C of E members vote Tory, while 48% are Labour. The Catholics are even more leftwing: only 17% vote Tory while 48% vote Labour. Of the Muslims, 22% are Conservative, and 33% Labour. Reactionary religious leaders do not represent their flocks. Unlike in the US, most British practising Christians are the gentle, left-leaning souls who created the highly successful Jubilee 2000 third world debt campaign. They damned Thatcher on poverty with their devastating \"Faith in the City\" report and denied her a triumphalist service for the Falklands war. William Hague is wildly wrong to think he can suborn Christians who run welfare programmes, drug projects or homeless schemes. Those working with the poorest are least likely to embrace some hare-brained Tory wheeze to shift the welfare state on to charity. These believers might also give Labour a blasting for not doing enough to help the poor (but none the less vote for them).

Are they so short of secular morality that they need hired help? Now they talk of bringing in yet more religions to join the 25 bishops already crowding the Lords benches. They talk of handing over many more schools to religions to run, when already a third of all state schools are religious - wildly out of kilter with this unbelieving nation.

China welcomed her with the sharp message that it would be forced to increase its nuclear arsenal if the US went ahead with its plan.</p> <p>Ms Albright pressed her hosts to respond favourably to peace overtures by Taiwan's new president, Chen Shui-bian, and she raised US concerns about human rights abuses in China. Beijing's foreign minister, Tang Jiaxuan, retorted that the US should stop selling arms to Taiwan, exclude it from any defence arrangement and avoid encouraging pro-independence tendencies there.</p> <p>As the most senior US official to visit Beijing since last year's US bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, Ms Albright also hoped to give a boost to relations between China and the US. Mr Tang said cautiously that \"bilateral relations have shown a certain improvement, especially after the setback last year.\"</p> <p>The Chinese argument against Washington's national missile defence programme (NMD) has been strengthened by the success of last week's summit between the leaders of North and South Korea. This has been widely interpreted as reducing the threat of a \"rogue\" North Korean missile, which the US uses to justify its \"son of star wars\" project.</p> <p>Beijing strategists have already argued that the US project will \"compromise China's strategic capability\".</p> <p>A report to be issued by the Oxford Research Group, based on a recent conference with Chinese military experts in Beijing, warns that Chinese opposition to the NMD should not be under-estimated.</p> <p>In a paper written for the conference, Major-General Pan Zhengqiang said that the missile programme would force China and Russia \"to take measures to uphold the credibility of their respective strategic deterrents\". It would poison relations between the three major nuclear powers and prompt \"a new round of the arms race\".</p> <p>Chinese senior officials believe that since Beijing has helped to bring about d\u00e9tente on the Korean peninsula, the US should think again about the effects of the programme on its relations with China.</p> <p>The image of North Korea as a \"rogue state\" which might launch a suicidal nuclear attack on the US has been frequently invoked by Washington. The term was used only last week by the defence secretary, William Cohen, on Russian television. But in a sign of embarrassment this week, the US state department announced that it will instead refer in the future to North Korea and other former \"rogues\", including Iran and Iraq, as \"states of concern\". China's foreign ministry spokesman, Zhu Bangzao, said last night that Beijing's opposition to NMD was \"consistent and clear\". It was equally opposed to the theatre missile defence package being considered by Japan, in which Taiwan has expressed an interest.</p> <p>\"China has consistently held that the US pretext for developing [these] systems does not have a leg to stand on,\" he said.</p> <p>Another Chinese strategist quoted in the Oxford Research Group report, Dr Yan Xuetong, said the NMD would \"invigorate the US-Japan alliance and make Japan more likely to become involved in potential military conflicts in the Taiwan Straits.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The US secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, faced tough talking yesterday in Beijing as Chinese experts warned that American plans for a national missile defence shield would compromise their security. China welcomed her with the sharp message that it would be forced to increase its nuclear arsenal if the US went ahead with its plan. Ms Albright pressed her hosts to respond favourably to peace overtures by Taiwan's new president, Chen Shui-bian, and she raised US concerns about human rights abuses in China. Beijing's foreign minister, Tang Jiaxuan, retorted that the US should stop selling arms to Taiwan, exclude it from any defence arrangement and avoid encouraging pro-independence tendencies there. As the most senior US official to visit Beijing since last year's US bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, Ms Albright also hoped to give a boost to relations between China and the US. Mr Tang said cautiously that \"bilateral relations have shown a certain improvement, especially after the setback last year.\" The Chinese argument against Washington's national missile defence programme (NMD) has been strengthened by the success of last week's summit between the leaders of North and South Korea. This has been widely interpreted as reducing the threat of a \"rogue\" North Korean missile, which the US uses to justify its \"son of star wars\" project. Beijing strategists have already argued that the US project will \"compromise China's strategic capability\". A report to be issued by the Oxford Research Group, based on a recent conference with Chinese military experts in Beijing, warns that Chinese opposition to the NMD should not be under-estimated. In a paper written for the conference, Major-General Pan Zhengqiang said that the missile programme would force China and Russia \"to take measures to uphold the credibility of their respective strategic deterrents\". It would poison relations between the three major nuclear powers and prompt \"a new round of the arms race\". Chinese senior officials believe that since Beijing has helped to bring about d\u00e9tente on the Korean peninsula, the US should think again about the effects of the programme on its relations with China. The image of North Korea as a \"rogue state\" which might launch a suicidal nuclear attack on the US has been frequently invoked by Washington. The term was used only last week by the defence secretary, William Cohen, on Russian television. But in a sign of embarrassment this week, the US state department announced that it will instead refer in the future to North Korea and other former \"rogues\", including Iran and Iraq, as \"states of concern\". China's foreign ministry spokesman, Zhu Bangzao, said last night that Beijing's opposition to NMD was \"consistent and clear\". It was equally opposed to the theatre missile defence package being considered by Japan, in which Taiwan has expressed an interest. \"China has consistently held that the US pretext for developing [these] systems does not have a leg to stand on,\" he said. Another Chinese strategist quoted in the Oxford Research Group report, Dr Yan Xuetong, said the NMD would \"invigorate the US-Japan alliance and make Japan more likely to become involved in potential military conflicts in the Taiwan Straits.\"",

Digital television was still something for the futurologists - BSkyB is now talking about having 5m digital subscribers by next year. And the internet was then strictly for geeks.</p> <p>The need for new broadcasting legislation has been apparent for some time and in the autumn a communications white paper is due, with a view to new law being passed during the next parliament. </p> <p>The term of art here is \"convergence\". This is exemplified by America Online, the internet service provider, buying the venerable media company Time Warner. It is the blurring of distinctions between telecommunications and media industries that makes the need for new regulation all the more pressing. The phenomenon was in evidence again this week when Vivendi, the French telecoms and media company, bought Seagram, which owns the Universal music and film businesses. When content and distribution platforms are owned by the same company, who should be watching over what they do? Tellingly, the white paper is being put together by both the Department of Culture, Media and Sport and the Department of Trade and Industry. </p> <p>In telecommunications change has been as rapid. When mobile phone operator Orange floated on the London stock market in 1996 the share price fell below the offer and stayed there for some time. Last month France Telecom was prepared to pay \u00a327bn for the still loss-making company because of its potential for internet-related wireless services including video streaming. Most of Europe's markets were not open to competition in 1996 and BT was not facing an onslaught from the likes of France Telecom in its own backyard. Meanwhile, the broadcasting ban on BT's networks will be lifted next year enabling the company to set itself up in competition with BSkyB. BT has already begun video-on-demand trials over its networks with a company called Yes Television.</p> <p>The range of those with an interest in the white paper is large.

      "bodyText": "When the 1996 Broadcasting Act was promulgated there were still eight large cable companies in Britain. Two exist today. The BBC had two free-to-air channels instead of five (although the three extra barely affect viewing habits). There was no Channel 5 (ditto). Digital television was still something for the futurologists - BSkyB is now talking about having 5m digital subscribers by next year. And the internet was then strictly for geeks. The need for new broadcasting legislation has been apparent for some time and in the autumn a communications white paper is due, with a view to new law being passed during the next parliament. The term of art here is \"convergence\". This is exemplified by America Online, the internet service provider, buying the venerable media company Time Warner. It is the blurring of distinctions between telecommunications and media industries that makes the need for new regulation all the more pressing. The phenomenon was in evidence again this week when Vivendi, the French telecoms and media company, bought Seagram, which owns the Universal music and film businesses. When content and distribution platforms are owned by the same company, who should be watching over what they do? Tellingly, the white paper is being put together by both the Department of Culture, Media and Sport and the Department of Trade and Industry. In telecommunications change has been as rapid. When mobile phone operator Orange floated on the London stock market in 1996 the share price fell below the offer and stayed there for some time. Last month France Telecom was prepared to pay \u00a327bn for the still loss-making company because of its potential for internet-related wireless services including video streaming. Most of Europe's markets were not open to competition in 1996 and BT was not facing an onslaught from the likes of France Telecom in its own backyard. Meanwhile, the broadcasting ban on BT's networks will be lifted next year enabling the company to set itself up in competition with BSkyB. BT has already begun video-on-demand trials over its networks with a company called Yes Television. The range of those with an interest in the white paper is large. They include, as well as BT, the actors' union Equity. The new act will need to consider competition and culture. In a market where there are hundreds of channels to choose from, do we need tight regulation on terrestrial companies' output? Critics of the BBC argue that the corporation is dumbing down to hang on to viewers in the face of competition instead of finding its character more easily defined among the detritus. The debate still raging about ITV's News at Ten is a prime example of how difficult regulation has become. ITV has argued, perhaps reasonably, that its prime-time schedule was hamstrung by the need for a 10pm news slot. Without it, ITV's prime time share improved after years of decline.

At the same time, should the BBC be allowed to use the licence fee to support a 24-hour news channel in a market where there are already commercial operators? BSkyB certainly thinks not after its own Sky News was bumped off a number of cable networks because the BBC offered its channel free. ITV demands to be allowed to merge into a single company and to end its licence payment to the government, which amounts to some \u00a3400m a year. For BSkyB, the grievance is open access to cable platforms just as anyone can transmit over the satellite broadcaster's platform. For Channel 4, the issue is entrenching its public service broadcaster status and warding off privatisation.

Dudley's daughter, Kathleen Bailey, was convicted of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm to Cornwall, and was given a two year suspended sentence. Her conviction is also to be referred to the appeal court. The killings were dubbed the \"torso murders\" after parts of Moseley's body were found in the Thames.

      "bodyText": "One of Britain's longest running and most controversial alleged miscarriage of justice cases is to be referred to the court of appeal, it was revealed yesterday. The cases of two men convicted for the \"torso murders\" in 1974 were recommended for review by the criminal cases review commission, which has spent three years examining the convictions for the double murder in north London. Reg Dudley, 75, and Robert Maynard, 61, who have always protested their innocence, were convicted in 1977 of the gangland executions of Billy Moseley and Micky Cornwall, and both were sentenced to life imprisonment. Dudley's daughter, Kathleen Bailey, was convicted of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm to Cornwall, and was given a two year suspended sentence. Her conviction is also to be referred to the appeal court. The killings were dubbed the \"torso murders\" after parts of Moseley's body were found in the Thames. Cornwall's body was found in a shallow grave in Hertfordshire. Since the quashing of the convictions in the Guildford Four, Birmingham Six and Bridgewater Three cases, the double murder has become one of Britain's longest running and most controversial cases. At their trial, the judge, Mr Justice Swanwick, recommended that Dudley and Maynard should serve a minimum of 15 years, but Maynard is still in prison and Dudley served 21 years before being given parole in August 1997. The key prosecution witness against Dudley and Maynard was Tony Wild, a small-time criminal who later confessed to the Guardian that he made up his evidence because he wanted a lighter sentence on a robbery charge. He was jailed for five years when his fellow robbers received 18-year sentences after he agreed to give evidence against Maynard and Dudley. He claimed he had heard them confess to the crimes while he was in the same wing of Brixton prison in south London. Dudley and Maynard, who both had long criminal records, claimed at their 136 day trial that they would never have confessed to a stranger in prison. But after he was released from prison, Wild, by then a born-again Christian, contacted the Guardian to say he had made up his evidence and that the men had never confessed to him at all. Yesterday Ms Bailey said her father was \"over the moon\" at the commission's decision. While an appeal does not automatically lead to the quashing of a conviction, the vast majority of cases referred back by the commission have led to convictions being overturned. The case against Maynard and Dudley, both from Islington, north London, was that they had killed Moseley either because he was having an affair with another criminal's wife or because he had accused Dudley of being an informer. It was suggested that Cornwall, a bank robber, was killed because he sought to avenge the death of his friend. There were no witnesses to the crimes or any forensic evidence and the case rested chiefly on remarks which detectives claimed had been made to them, which Dudley and Maynard denied, and Wild's claims that Dudley said he had taken Moseley's head to Brighton to show it to a friend. Two fellow prisoners also gave evidence. A campaign to clear the men was launched after their conviction but a 1979 appeal was unsuccessful despite new evidence. Wild's confession and two TV documentaries failed to bring further appeals. New evidence slowly emerged indicating the innocence of the men but Wild has so far declined to give evidence for an appeal unless he is given immunity from a perjury charge.

      "body": "<p>Heaven is empty and the Frog and Fern is closed. The war vets are on the warpath and Chimanimani's lodges are desolate. It is election time in Zimbabwe and I have come home. Although it's been years since I lived here, Chimanimani (which used to be called Melsetter, after the Orkney town) remains stuck in my mind as that central reference point from which all other places radiate. It lies in an isolated valley along the eastern border with Mozambique, nestled in the crook of a winding range of glittering granite mountains from which the village now takes its name. In recent times it has become even more remote; cyclone Eline swept away its bridges earlier this year, leaving it cut off by road for more than a month. As my car strains up the hillside from the Biriwiri valley, the road is reduced to one lane, the other has been washed down into the valley below.</p> <p>The shadows of war are long here. In 1964, on this road etched into the cliff-side, the first attack of the Chimurenga, the liberation war, was carried out by a band of guerrillas called the Crocodile Gang. The victim was our next-door neighbour, Piet Oberholzer. My mother was the attending doctor. By independence in 1980, one of every four white farmers had been killed by guerrillas. And now, 20 years later, Chimanimani is under siege once more by remnants of those same guerrillas. But the power struggle has changed dramatically since then. Now Robert Mugabe's ruling Zanu-PF party is fighting for its political life against an upsurgent opposition, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), a party that didn't even exist a year ago.</p> <p>I wander over to the Msasa cafe where I find its owner, John Barlow, in the back carving an African drum from a log of blue mahogany. \"This was supposed to be the best year of my life,\" says Barlow sadly, as we sit in his newly renovated, empty, cafe, sipping fresh local coffee by the fire and discussing evacuation routes, the subject du jour around many Zimbabwean dinner tables this week.</p> <p>Most white Zimbabweans, and indeed many middle-class black people, have what they call \"gap bags\" packed and ready, in case the election results trigger a spasm of violence. My sister and her friends have a complicated plan that involves various rendezvous along the route from Harare, then crossing the Zambezi into Zambia. (The Zanu-PF candidate in my sister's garden suburb of northern Harare is Comrade Stalin Mau Mau - a deliberately unsettling nom de guerre that jumps out at you from posters on every lamppost there.) They have food supplies and visas and have registered their cars with the police so they can drive across the border. Some here have acted pre-emptively, going \"on holiday\" for the next couple of weeks, deaf to the entreaties of the opposition MDC that everyone with a vote should stay and use it.</p> <p>President Mugabe appears convinced that his present travails are all the fault of the whites, and his racial rhetoric has become white hot. Never mind that there are only 70,000 whites left here (in a population of over 12m) many of whom have been in deep political hibernation. Or that only four of the MDC's 120 candidates are white. The veterans' leader Chenjerai \"Hitler\" Hunzvi has said - in fact he keeps saying it - that if Zanu-PF loses the election, he and his men will go back to war. Add these two ingredients together: a threat of war and conveniently colour-coded culprits, and the evacuation plans don't seem quite so nutty.</p> <p>Evacuating from Chimanimani however, is particularly tricky. With its back to the soaring mountains, there are only two roads in, and one of them has been blocked by cyclone Eline. If the other one is controlled by war vets, how to get out? The whites here have already evacuated once, last month, when several truckloads of vets became incensed at a rumour that Hunzvi's house in Harare had been torched (it was just another of a spate of wild rumours) and decided to take out their ire on the local whites. There aren't very many of them left, only about 20 families. Warned first by their domestic workers and black colleagues, and then by the local police chief (who has since been demoted and transferred for his troubles), the whites formed a convoy and drove up to Skyline junction, and out of the valley, to lie low till it cooled down.</p> <p>John Barlow was about the only white to stay that time, but even he is taking evacuation seriously now. He has decided that if it comes down to it, the only way out for him might be to grab his kids and do a Sound of Music - climb up over the mountains and into Mozambique. The very idea of going to Mozambique for sanctuary strikes me as absurd: it is officially one of the poorest countries in the world after being ravaged by 30 years of civil war.</p> <p>Having stripped and beaten the black school teachers in front of their pupils, and threatened the black managers at some of the saw mills, the vets in Chimanimani are particularly interested in one white man, Roy Bennet, the owner of Charleswood. This 7,000-acre farm is arguably the prettiest farm in the country, tucked up against the national park. It is latticed with irrigation canals, which feed the red earth and the neat rows of coffee bushes that sprout from it. The local Ndau people call Bennet, Pachedu . It means \"one of us\". A pitch-perfect Shona speaker, he was approached by a delegation of local councillors and kraal (village) heads who were sick of absentee MPs and stagnant development, and asked to stand as their candidate. After flirting with Zanu-PF, he's now standing for the MDC, a white man standing in a rural constituency where over 99.9% of the electorate is black. He shows me a file fat with letters from black supporters. Some address him as Father Chimanimani, others thank him for helping to repair bridges after the cyclone.</p> <p>Bennet's rival, the Zanu-PF candidate, is Munacho Mutezo, an engineering graduate from Birmingham and Glasgow universities. His father was detained by the old Rhodesian authorities, Bennet tells me, for being involved with the Crocodile Gang. Now the battle lines are drawn once more. But this time the homeboy is a white man who spends most of his time here. Mutezo on the other hand, is based five hours away in Harare.</p> <p>Judging by his reception from the locals, Bennet is probably a shoo-in - if he can just stay alive until the polls open tomorrow. He has had a steady stream of death threats. His farm is guarded by dozens of youths armed with clubs and iron bars, and he has informers in the village and the black township who warn him of approaching danger.</p> <p>Bennet has only just moved back on to his farm after war vets invaded it. They seized his wife, Heather, who was pregnant at the time, put a machete to her throat and made her chant Zanu-PF slogans. They beat up several of the workers and then they occupied the farmhouse and trashed it over several weeks, stealing many of its contents and smearing shit on the walls. They cut the paws off the lion skin rug, to use them for muti - a type of traditional medicine. Heather miscarried. But Bennet negotiated a return and the vets eventually left, feeling vulnerable to a hostile workforce that had had a gut-full of being bullied.</p> <p>\"These white farmers who appease - I've got no time for them. Appeasement has never worked, just look at history,\" says Bennet, a great bear of a man, who played polo-cross for the national side and often goes barefoot in public. \"What's so heartening about these elections is that there's a good percentage of Zimbabwean whites who've said, 'sod it, let's get involved,' and we've suffered together with the blacks, and feared together with them. We've made a stand and shown that we're prepared to sacrifice ourselves for this country. And isn't that what a patriot is, after all? It's the first time I've felt really Zimbabwean.\"</p> <p>As we sit talking under the tall thatch by the fire, the radio crackles into life with a message of trouble - a truck of war vets has been spotted coming this way. All Roy's hunting rifles are in police custody, but one of his mechanics peels down a horse blanket on the sofa to reveal a shotgun and a bandolier of cartridges.</p> <p>\"Our guys,\" as Bennet calls his MDC guards, are gathering in strategic points to repulse the attack. \"I'm sick of running now,\" he says. \"If they're gonna come, they must come and let's get this over with.\"</p> <p>But tonight is not to be the night and I eventually fall asleep to the gurgling of the river and the call of the nightjars. I wake up once to the sound of murmuring outside the window and peep out to see the MDC guards huddled round a fire there, with blankets draped over their shoulders, hands clasped around enamel mugs of coffee. These are brave men, many are kids still, who are taking on the full wrath of the state for their vision of better Zimbabwe, and they are in just as much danger as Bennet.</p> <p>Later, I accompany Bennet to the police station where he has been summoned for a meeting with the vets. They tell him that they intend to reoccupy his farm, but they are prepared to do it peacefully, cooperatively. \"That's what you said last time,\" spits Bennet, raising his voice and reeling off a litany of the crimes they committed when they first visited Charleswood. The room is thick with tension and several of the vets look as though they would shoot him this second, if they were armed.</p> <p>We discover en route from Bennet's election agent, James Mukwaya, that the rally Bennet is supposed to address this morning in the Ngorima communal lands has been cancelled. Gangs from Zanu-PF have been there overnight, moving from house to house, warning people that if they attend they will be killed. But Bennet is not down hearted. They're all on our side anyway, he says, so why risk their lives with public rallies, we know how they'll vote when the time comes.</p> <p>Along the foothills from Charleswood, the Steyns aren't quite so optimistic about the future. They are having a bad week and to make it worse, a bush fire has just crossed the mountain from Mozambique and is threatening to burn down their farm. In the old farmhouse with its Cape Constantia gables, Louis Steyn seems lost in a kind of numbed reverie. He sits in his plum-coloured draylon chair, sucking heavily on his pipe, while Daleen, his wife, keeps up a cheerful chatter.</p> <p>Louis Steyn's grandfather came here in 1893, leading the Steyn trek up from the Orange Free State in South Africa. There have been Steyns farming these lush hillsides ever since, but it looks like Louis could be the last. His farm has been designated by the government for compulsory takeover, though he vows: \"We'll fight it to the bloody end.\" A delegation of ministry envoys arrived by car last week, having driven all the way from Harare to deliver the designation letter by hand.</p> <p>\"I offered them a sandwich and a cup of tea,\" says Daleen, \"but they were in a hurry because they had lots more designation orders to deliver to white farmers.\"</p> <p>The Steyns have also been \"occupied\" by war veterans for some months now. When the vets first arrived, Daleen told them: \"We worship the same God you and I, let's pray together to him for justice.\" And so they did, the vets and the Steyns, they got down on their knees on the lawn outside the farmhouse and prayed together, and then the vets went off and pegged their land.</p> <p>Between occupation and designation it does look pretty bleak for the Steyns. Not that they haven't been through tough times before. For nearly a decade during the war they had to commute to the farm from the village because it was too dangerous to stay overnight.</p> <p>\"Then we got ambushed in our car,\" remembers Daleen. \"They shot at us and fired at us with a rocket launcher. There was so much smoke it was dark and we saw tracer bullets flying all over the place, it was like a starry night.\" The car took 11 hits, but Louis managed to coax it to the next bend in the road. \"I drove out of there on the rims of the tyres spinning on the road,\" adds Louis.</p> <p>Their Rhodesian ridgeback canters after my car as the Steyn's wave goodbye, having asked me to give their apologies to Lord and Lady Plunket who are holding a tea party this afternoon. The Plunkets own a modest timber est ate and have been migratory residents here ever since I can remember. Lady Plunket has laid on quite a spread - the table is laden with plates of buttered gingerbread and delicate triangles of crustless sandwiches. Pretty much the whole white community is here. They fit comfortably on to the Plunket's veranda. Though it has brought much oppro brium down upon them, most of the whites here support Roy Bennet's stand. \"He's my hero,\" says Lady Plunket, clasping her hands to her heart.</p> <p>As the first fingers of the night mist creep down the mountain gorges, and pine-scented smoke from the hearth fire fills the air, we fall inevitably to discussing the election; the chances of a fair ballot, or of the government accepting a defeat; the possibility of a coup.

      "bodyText": "Heaven is empty and the Frog and Fern is closed. The war vets are on the warpath and Chimanimani's lodges are desolate. It is election time in Zimbabwe and I have come home. Although it's been years since I lived here, Chimanimani (which used to be called Melsetter, after the Orkney town) remains stuck in my mind as that central reference point from which all other places radiate. It lies in an isolated valley along the eastern border with Mozambique, nestled in the crook of a winding range of glittering granite mountains from which the village now takes its name. In recent times it has become even more remote; cyclone Eline swept away its bridges earlier this year, leaving it cut off by road for more than a month. As my car strains up the hillside from the Biriwiri valley, the road is reduced to one lane, the other has been washed down into the valley below. The shadows of war are long here. In 1964, on this road etched into the cliff-side, the first attack of the Chimurenga, the liberation war, was carried out by a band of guerrillas called the Crocodile Gang. The victim was our next-door neighbour, Piet Oberholzer. My mother was the attending doctor. By independence in 1980, one of every four white farmers had been killed by guerrillas. And now, 20 years later, Chimanimani is under siege once more by remnants of those same guerrillas. But the power struggle has changed dramatically since then. Now Robert Mugabe's ruling Zanu-PF party is fighting for its political life against an upsurgent opposition, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), a party that didn't even exist a year ago. I wander over to the Msasa cafe where I find its owner, John Barlow, in the back carving an African drum from a log of blue mahogany. \"This was supposed to be the best year of my life,\" says Barlow sadly, as we sit in his newly renovated, empty, cafe, sipping fresh local coffee by the fire and discussing evacuation routes, the subject du jour around many Zimbabwean dinner tables this week. Most white Zimbabweans, and indeed many middle-class black people, have what they call \"gap bags\" packed and ready, in case the election results trigger a spasm of violence. My sister and her friends have a complicated plan that involves various rendezvous along the route from Harare, then crossing the Zambezi into Zambia. (The Zanu-PF candidate in my sister's garden suburb of northern Harare is Comrade Stalin Mau Mau - a deliberately unsettling nom de guerre that jumps out at you from posters on every lamppost there.) They have food supplies and visas and have registered their cars with the police so they can drive across the border. Some here have acted pre-emptively, going \"on holiday\" for the next couple of weeks, deaf to the entreaties of the opposition MDC that everyone with a vote should stay and use it. President Mugabe appears convinced that his present travails are all the fault of the whites, and his racial rhetoric has become white hot. Never mind that there are only 70,000 whites left here (in a population of over 12m) many of whom have been in deep political hibernation. Or that only four of the MDC's 120 candidates are white. The veterans' leader Chenjerai \"Hitler\" Hunzvi has said - in fact he keeps saying it - that if Zanu-PF loses the election, he and his men will go back to war. Add these two ingredients together: a threat of war and conveniently colour-coded culprits, and the evacuation plans don't seem quite so nutty. Evacuating from Chimanimani however, is particularly tricky. With its back to the soaring mountains, there are only two roads in, and one of them has been blocked by cyclone Eline. If the other one is controlled by war vets, how to get out? The whites here have already evacuated once, last month, when several truckloads of vets became incensed at a rumour that Hunzvi's house in Harare had been torched (it was just another of a spate of wild rumours) and decided to take out their ire on the local whites. There aren't very many of them left, only about 20 families. Warned first by their domestic workers and black colleagues, and then by the local police chief (who has since been demoted and transferred for his troubles), the whites formed a convoy and drove up to Skyline junction, and out of the valley, to lie low till it cooled down. John Barlow was about the only white to stay that time, but even he is taking evacuation seriously now. He has decided that if it comes down to it, the only way out for him might be to grab his kids and do a Sound of Music - climb up over the mountains and into Mozambique. The very idea of going to Mozambique for sanctuary strikes me as absurd: it is officially one of the poorest countries in the world after being ravaged by 30 years of civil war. Having stripped and beaten the black school teachers in front of their pupils, and threatened the black managers at some of the saw mills, the vets in Chimanimani are particularly interested in one white man, Roy Bennet, the owner of Charleswood. This 7,000-acre farm is arguably the prettiest farm in the country, tucked up against the national park. It is latticed with irrigation canals, which feed the red earth and the neat rows of coffee bushes that sprout from it. The local Ndau people call Bennet, Pachedu . It means \"one of us\". A pitch-perfect Shona speaker, he was approached by a delegation of local councillors and kraal (village) heads who were sick of absentee MPs and stagnant development, and asked to stand as their candidate. After flirting with Zanu-PF, he's now standing for the MDC, a white man standing in a rural constituency where over 99.9% of the electorate is black. He shows me a file fat with letters from black supporters. Some address him as Father Chimanimani, others thank him for helping to repair bridges after the cyclone. Bennet's rival, the Zanu-PF candidate, is Munacho Mutezo, an engineering graduate from Birmingham and Glasgow universities. His father was detained by the old Rhodesian authorities, Bennet tells me, for being involved with the Crocodile Gang. Now the battle lines are drawn once more. But this time the homeboy is a white man who spends most of his time here. Mutezo on the other hand, is based five hours away in Harare. Judging by his reception from the locals, Bennet is probably a shoo-in - if he can just stay alive until the polls open tomorrow. He has had a steady stream of death threats. His farm is guarded by dozens of youths armed with clubs and iron bars, and he has informers in the village and the black township who warn him of approaching danger. Bennet has only just moved back on to his farm after war vets invaded it. They seized his wife, Heather, who was pregnant at the time, put a machete to her throat and made her chant Zanu-PF slogans. They beat up several of the workers and then they occupied the farmhouse and trashed it over several weeks, stealing many of its contents and smearing shit on the walls. They cut the paws off the lion skin rug, to use them for muti - a type of traditional medicine. Heather miscarried. But Bennet negotiated a return and the vets eventually left, feeling vulnerable to a hostile workforce that had had a gut-full of being bullied. \"These white farmers who appease - I've got no time for them. Appeasement has never worked, just look at history,\" says Bennet, a great bear of a man, who played polo-cross for the national side and often goes barefoot in public. \"What's so heartening about these elections is that there's a good percentage of Zimbabwean whites who've said, 'sod it, let's get involved,' and we've suffered together with the blacks, and feared together with them. We've made a stand and shown that we're prepared to sacrifice ourselves for this country. And isn't that what a patriot is, after all? It's the first time I've felt really Zimbabwean.\" As we sit talking under the tall thatch by the fire, the radio crackles into life with a message of trouble - a truck of war vets has been spotted coming this way. All Roy's hunting rifles are in police custody, but one of his mechanics peels down a horse blanket on the sofa to reveal a shotgun and a bandolier of cartridges. \"Our guys,\" as Bennet calls his MDC guards, are gathering in strategic points to repulse the attack. \"I'm sick of running now,\" he says. \"If they're gonna come, they must come and let's get this over with.\" But tonight is not to be the night and I eventually fall asleep to the gurgling of the river and the call of the nightjars. I wake up once to the sound of murmuring outside the window and peep out to see the MDC guards huddled round a fire there, with blankets draped over their shoulders, hands clasped around enamel mugs of coffee. These are brave men, many are kids still, who are taking on the full wrath of the state for their vision of better Zimbabwe, and they are in just as much danger as Bennet. Later, I accompany Bennet to the police station where he has been summoned for a meeting with the vets. They tell him that they intend to reoccupy his farm, but they are prepared to do it peacefully, cooperatively. \"That's what you said last time,\" spits Bennet, raising his voice and reeling off a litany of the crimes they committed when they first visited Charleswood. The room is thick with tension and several of the vets look as though they would shoot him this second, if they were armed. We discover en route from Bennet's election agent, James Mukwaya, that the rally Bennet is supposed to address this morning in the Ngorima communal lands has been cancelled. Gangs from Zanu-PF have been there overnight, moving from house to house, warning people that if they attend they will be killed. But Bennet is not down hearted. They're all on our side anyway, he says, so why risk their lives with public rallies, we know how they'll vote when the time comes. Along the foothills from Charleswood, the Steyns aren't quite so optimistic about the future. They are having a bad week and to make it worse, a bush fire has just crossed the mountain from Mozambique and is threatening to burn down their farm. In the old farmhouse with its Cape Constantia gables, Louis Steyn seems lost in a kind of numbed reverie. He sits in his plum-coloured draylon chair, sucking heavily on his pipe, while Daleen, his wife, keeps up a cheerful chatter. Louis Steyn's grandfather came here in 1893, leading the Steyn trek up from the Orange Free State in South Africa.

      "body": "<p>Typical. You take off on holiday for a month and when you come back, nothing's the same.</p> <p>They've even changed the money on you. My first financial transaction on landing Stateside involved my surrendering $10 and getting back a fistful of what to my eye looked like quarters, worth 25 cents.</p> <p>\"You're fucking kidding,\" I said with the hair-trigger temper that is jetlag's most troublesome symptom. \"I gave you a 10-spot. Gimme my money, asshole.\"</p> <p> The man behind the cash register was a model of Jeevesian emollience: \"Uh, these are the all-new dollar coins, sir. If you'll permit me to open the register I can also show you the new five-dollar bill. It's awful nice-looking.\"</p> <p>I apologised profusely, in shamed and anguished terms, and walked into a glass door on my way out. I'd left all my purchases on the counter and had to return rather sheepishly for them an hour later.</p> <p> Just as I got used to the fact that all American money was the same size and colour - and it only took me a couple of decades - all of a sudden the Fed goes all Bank of England on me. And whenever I return to England these days I have to get used to the money being all different.</p> <p>I had a similar encounter in London thanks to what I thought were the inadequate distinctions between a tenner and a twenty-quid note.</p> <p> In the following days, as the 'lag loosened its satanic grip on me, I encountered the rejigged, toy-money fives and squinted sceptically at the \"all-new\" dollar coin. It's the same size and weight as a quarter-dollar, but gold, not silver, and bears on its obverse the raised legend \"E Pluribus Unum\" - \"From Many, One\" - which prompted from me a sarcastic guffaw, given the hideously balkanised state of the American Republic these days (forget the melting-pot theory of America: today it's a compartmentalised salad bar in a rundown Sizzler steak-and-lobster joint).</p> <p>And if they're going to change the money, why not change it a lot ? This new shit still features the same boring founding farts as the old: Hamilton, Ben Franklin, pot-farmer George. Why can't they put some decent people on the money, like Sly Stone or Jayne Mansfield or Warren Oates? Will Alan Greenspan never learn?</p> <p> Turning from money to movies, as sadly we must, there's little that, on a cursory examination of the box-office charts, could possibly be termed \"all-new\". In fact it was so \"all-old\" that I wondered for a moment if George Pal hadn't had his wicked way with me and time-zapped me back to the early 70s.</p> <p>Shaft and Gone in 60 Seconds at numbers one and two? And a Mission: Impossible film at number four? I looked out of my window for planet-sized Afros and aircraft-carrier lapels. Nothing. What gives?</p> <p> Turns out it's all remakes, rip-offs, retreads and sequels this week. Lurking down at numbers 11 and 12 we've even got Fantasia 2000 and Jesus' Son (I hope the poster shrieks, \"With All-New Testament!\"), which is at least a better title than Son of Kong.</p> <p> Mission: Impossible 2, to take one example, is the sequel to a big-screen remake of a TV series that was itself heavily indebted to the Bond movies and Our Man Flint. On top of that, it's also a redux version of Hitchcock's Notorious and even cops a few moves from John Woo's own Once a Thief. Although I rather like it, I lost count of how many degrees of separation from originality that involves.</p> <p> Likewise the crowd-pleasing Gladiator, still hanging in there at number eight after seven weeks of boffo receipts. You can carve this movie up into the elements it nicks from old sword-and-sandal epics: the Imperial household familiar to us from Anthony Mann's sublime Fall of the Roman Empire, married to the up-from-slavery narrative trajectory of Kubrick's Spartacus - even down to Djimon Hounsou in the Woody Strode role - and force-mated with Leni Riefenstahl's cinema gargantua aesthetic. Been here before.</p> <p> And Shanghai Noon is a retread of the 48 Hours comedy formula that Walter Hill refined from Stanley Kramer's po-faced The Defiant Ones, and which has been replicated ad nauseam et infinitum ever since in movies ranging (and not widely) from Lethal Weapon and Chill Factor all the way to Rush Hour. All that's changed is that the template has been relocated Way Out West. Oh sorry, I forgot about Red Sun, the 1970 Eastern Western starring Charles Bronson and Toshiro Mifune. Nothing new here either, then.</p> <p> Need we mention Big Momma's House, whose star, Martin Lawrence, is a retread of his patron/mentor Eddie Murphy (himself a Richard Pryor xerox, minus the genius)? He's here doing an expanded version of Murphy's Grandma turn in The Nutty Professor - another remake, with a sequel of its own in the offing.</p> <p> I could keep this up all night, and believe me, I plan to, because up top we have Gone in 60 Seconds and Shaft. The former may be a step up from Gumball Rally and The Cannonball Run 2, but the title is its own best review. The director of the original was, if memory serves, killed in a car crash while filming its sequel, which has a certain symmetry to it. See it by all means - then rent Vanishing Point.</p> <p> Which brings us to Shaft, a remake that's not so bad, considering the conflicts that apparently raged during production between Samuel L Jackson, director John Singleton, producer Joel Silver and screenwriter Richard Price. It's saved by the Sam Jackson Solid Gold Guarantee, which decrees that if Jackson is in your movie, your movie will be saved (unless of course it's The Phantom Menace). Jackson was the one thing worth watching in Deep Blue Sea, apart from Saffron Burrows being torn to pieces, and The Negotiator would have been nothing without him.</p> <p>Shaft doesn't stretch him much - he really does little more than reprise his Exterminating Angel from Pulp Fiction - but Price writes great lines for him to roll around his mouth: \"I know motherfuckers who'd waste entire zip codes for that kinda cheese,\" is just one of the sillier.</p> <p> It was also nice to see a cameo from Richard Roundtree, who should have been Denzel-big and Fishburne-cool, but was thrown out with the blaxploitation bathwater when the studios whitened back up in the Lucas-loving late 70s. Roundtree and Jackson meant I didn't storm the box office and demand my money back. They can keep their low-down dirty dollar coins.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Typical. You take off on holiday for a month and when you come back, nothing's the same. They've even changed the money on you. My first financial transaction on landing Stateside involved my surrendering $10 and getting back a fistful of what to my eye looked like quarters, worth 25 cents. \"You're fucking kidding,\" I said with the hair-trigger temper that is jetlag's most troublesome symptom. \"I gave you a 10-spot. Gimme my money, asshole.\" The man behind the cash register was a model of Jeevesian emollience: \"Uh, these are the all-new dollar coins, sir. If you'll permit me to open the register I can also show you the new five-dollar bill. It's awful nice-looking.\" I apologised profusely, in shamed and anguished terms, and walked into a glass door on my way out. I'd left all my purchases on the counter and had to return rather sheepishly for them an hour later. Just as I got used to the fact that all American money was the same size and colour - and it only took me a couple of decades - all of a sudden the Fed goes all Bank of England on me. And whenever I return to England these days I have to get used to the money being all different. I had a similar encounter in London thanks to what I thought were the inadequate distinctions between a tenner and a twenty-quid note. In the following days, as the 'lag loosened its satanic grip on me, I encountered the rejigged, toy-money fives and squinted sceptically at the \"all-new\" dollar coin. It's the same size and weight as a quarter-dollar, but gold, not silver, and bears on its obverse the raised legend \"E Pluribus Unum\" - \"From Many, One\" - which prompted from me a sarcastic guffaw, given the hideously balkanised state of the American Republic these days (forget the melting-pot theory of America: today it's a compartmentalised salad bar in a rundown Sizzler steak-and-lobster joint). And if they're going to change the money, why not change it a lot ? This new shit still features the same boring founding farts as the old: Hamilton, Ben Franklin, pot-farmer George. Why can't they put some decent people on the money, like Sly Stone or Jayne Mansfield or Warren Oates? Will Alan Greenspan never learn? Turning from money to movies, as sadly we must, there's little that, on a cursory examination of the box-office charts, could possibly be termed \"all-new\". In fact it was so \"all-old\" that I wondered for a moment if George Pal hadn't had his wicked way with me and time-zapped me back to the early 70s. Shaft and Gone in 60 Seconds at numbers one and two? And a Mission: Impossible film at number four? I looked out of my window for planet-sized Afros and aircraft-carrier lapels. Nothing. What gives? Turns out it's all remakes, rip-offs, retreads and sequels this week. Lurking down at numbers 11 and 12 we've even got Fantasia 2000 and Jesus' Son (I hope the poster shrieks, \"With All-New Testament!\"), which is at least a better title than Son of Kong. Mission: Impossible 2, to take one example, is the sequel to a big-screen remake of a TV series that was itself heavily indebted to the Bond movies and Our Man Flint. On top of that, it's also a redux version of Hitchcock's Notorious and even cops a few moves from John Woo's own Once a Thief. Although I rather like it, I lost count of how many degrees of separation from originality that involves. Likewise the crowd-pleasing Gladiator, still hanging in there at number eight after seven weeks of boffo receipts. You can carve this movie up into the elements it nicks from old sword-and-sandal epics: the Imperial household familiar to us from Anthony Mann's sublime Fall of the Roman Empire, married to the up-from-slavery narrative trajectory of Kubrick's Spartacus - even down to Djimon Hounsou in the Woody Strode role - and force-mated with Leni Riefenstahl's cinema gargantua aesthetic. Been here before. And Shanghai Noon is a retread of the 48 Hours comedy formula that Walter Hill refined from Stanley Kramer's po-faced The Defiant Ones, and which has been replicated ad nauseam et infinitum ever since in movies ranging (and not widely) from Lethal Weapon and Chill Factor all the way to Rush Hour. All that's changed is that the template has been relocated Way Out West. Oh sorry, I forgot about Red Sun, the 1970 Eastern Western starring Charles Bronson and Toshiro Mifune. Nothing new here either, then. Need we mention Big Momma's House, whose star, Martin Lawrence, is a retread of his patron/mentor Eddie Murphy (himself a Richard Pryor xerox, minus the genius)? He's here doing an expanded version of Murphy's Grandma turn in The Nutty Professor - another remake, with a sequel of its own in the offing. I could keep this up all night, and believe me, I plan to, because up top we have Gone in 60 Seconds and Shaft. The former may be a step up from Gumball Rally and The Cannonball Run 2, but the title is its own best review. The director of the original was, if memory serves, killed in a car crash while filming its sequel, which has a certain symmetry to it. See it by all means - then rent Vanishing Point. Which brings us to Shaft, a remake that's not so bad, considering the conflicts that apparently raged during production between Samuel L Jackson, director John Singleton, producer Joel Silver and screenwriter Richard Price. It's saved by the Sam Jackson Solid Gold Guarantee, which decrees that if Jackson is in your movie, your movie will be saved (unless of course it's The Phantom Menace). Jackson was the one thing worth watching in Deep Blue Sea, apart from Saffron Burrows being torn to pieces, and The Negotiator would have been nothing without him. Shaft doesn't stretch him much - he really does little more than reprise his Exterminating Angel from Pulp Fiction - but Price writes great lines for him to roll around his mouth: \"I know motherfuckers who'd waste entire zip codes for that kinda cheese,\" is just one of the sillier. It was also nice to see a cameo from Richard Roundtree, who should have been Denzel-big and Fishburne-cool, but was thrown out with the blaxploitation bathwater when the studios whitened back up in the Lucas-loving late 70s. Roundtree and Jackson meant I didn't storm the box office and demand my money back. They can keep their low-down dirty dollar coins.",

      "body": "<p>Film noir is one of those movie terms that drive people crazy. For aficionados, the films are as difficult to shut up about as they are to define. Is noir a genre? A mood? A style? Or just some moody lighting and a sax riff? Why is The Maltese Falcon noir, but not Bonnie and Clyde? Why The Last Seduction but not The Usual Suspects? Why Raging Bull but never, ever Rocky? Or do you simply have to shrug and say, \"It's like art, you'll know it when you see it\"? </p> <p>Certainly, Raymond Chandler did. The essential qualities have never been better described than by that noir archetype of the disillusioned outsider, Philip Marlowe, when he looks down on LA in The Little Sister: \"Now we've got big money, the sharp shooters, the percentage workers, the fast dollar boys, the hoodlums out of New York and Chicago. We've got the flashy restaurants and nightclubs they run, and the hotels and apartment houses they own, and the grifters and con men and female bandits that live in them. The riffraff of a big hard-boiled city with no more personality than a paper cup.\" </p> <p> But that was then - the time of chain-smoking loners in the rain-slicked streets of film noir's heyday in the 40s and early 50s. What is noir now? And, more to the point, why does it never die? The answer is paranoia. The fear - especially during the Reagan/Thatcher years of the late 80s - that the world was, in fact, not on an extended 50s rerun of \"be happy\" innocence, that Reagan's \"City on the Hill\" was at best a mirage, at worst a tip or, as the downbeat noir novelist Jim Thompson suggested in the 50s, \"Things are not what they seem.\" Because, like its grumpy, grizzled grandfather, today's film noir is paranoid, nihilistic, maybe even sadistic.</p> <p>The world it inhabits looks out of kilter and dangerous; there are shadows everywhere, and garish swatches of brightness - usually coming out of gun barrels. Yet the actors aren't just framed in darkness, they're shrouded in it - or sliced by the stabbing shadows of venetian blinds. </p> <p>But noir isn't just a style, an art director's plundering of pre-war French and German movies. It's wisecracking and know-it-all but with something romantic in it too. In all the best noir movies, there's a yearning for something more. Film noir - and, for that matter, neo-noir - tells us that by refusing the illusion of solace and sentimentality, by looking into the shadows, we may find something more solid and trustworthy than anything our pipe dreams can offer us. Because films noirs are visions in the dark. They are our voluptous nightmares. </p> <p><strong>Classic Noir</strong></p> <p><strong>The Maltese Falcon</strong> (1941): The first and and some say the finest noir, John Huston's debut movie gave Humphrey Bogart his most exciting role. Even after a dozen viewings, Bogart's Sam Spade shocks us with his sudden outburts of greed and rage, with his shifts between self-interest and moral rectitude and back again. That is the film's strength and the reason why it defined film noir - good and evil are handcuffed together in all its characters. </p> <p><strong> Murder, My Sweet </strong>(1945): Based on Raymond Chandler's Farewell, My Lovely, this film's use of shadows, mirrors and disorienting fogs - not to mention venetian blinds - gave noir its visual style. Curiously, Chandler thought that its star, the ex-crooner Dick Powell, rather than Bogart, came closest to his conception of Philip Marlowe. </p> <p><strong> Double Indemnity</strong> (1944): The result of an uneasy alliance between three of noir's greatest names, Double Indemnity was taken from a James M Cain novel, directed by Billy Wilder and adapted by Wilder and Raymond Chandler. And it's got everything: style, sex and murder. There are no happy endings in noir, but who wouldn't kill for Barbara Stanwyck's femme fatale? </p> <p><strong> The Big Heat</strong> (1953): The director, Fritz Lang, is the link between film noir and its visual roots in German expressionism, but it's the sadism in The Big Heat that poleaxes you - from a hero imbued with obsession and loneliness to the heavy played by Lee Marvin rearing back from his scarred moll after he's thrown scalding coffee in her face. </p> <p><strong>Touch of Evil </strong>(1958): In a famous essay, director Paul Schrader says this movie is \"film noir's epitaph\". But what a way to bow out. By then noir had been whitewashed and transplanted to TV shows like Dragnet but this lurid, flamboyantly exhibitionist thriller from Orson Welles is as palpably nasty as the murky waters of the canal featured in its deadly climax. </p> <p><strong>Neo-noir</strong></p> <p><strong>Chinatown</strong> (1974): In Robert Towne's original script, Evelyn (played by Faye Dunaway) shoots her father and is saved from jail by JJ Gittes (Jack Nicholson). But director Roman Polanski insisted that the forces of darkness were unbeatable. No one makes any difference, and Gittes' meddling probably only makes matters worse. Polanski, as Towne said, \"saw the darkness at the end of the tunnel\". </p> <p><strong> Night Moves </strong>(1975): Noir in the 70s was about deflating myths and puncturing film genres, and one of the most effective deflators was Arthur Penn. Here, the shamus (Gene Hackman) has a fatal flaw. He needs to know the facts, the answers. But Hackman can't save anyone, much less himself. His increasing frustration is the film's message: to search for the truth is futile. </p> <p><strong> Body Heat </strong>(1981): This is a film noir about a man who's seen too many films noirs, a dim Florida attorney who, in time-honoured noir tradition, gets trapped by a beautiful, mysterious woman into murdering her husband. Though the film clings almost too closely to the femme fatale's coat-tails, Lawrence Kasdan's steamy, sex-driven camera takes you back to the slinky, good old, bad old days. </p> <p><strong>Devil in a Blue Dress</strong> (1995): An underrated urban drama with a difference, a neo-noir about outsiders - African-Americans, non-fatal femmes and, most of all, its hero, Easy Rawlins, straddling the \"color line\" in late-40s LA. \"Nervous?\" asks the heroine. \"Here I was in the middle of the night,\" says Easy, \"in a white neighborhood with a white woman in my car. Naw, I wasn't nervous. I was stupid.\" </p> <p><strong>LA Confidential </strong>(1997): A high-low conspiracy writ large, Curtis Hanson's movie lacked the ruthless bite of James Ellroy's original novel. More a nostalgic homage than a searing rejuvenation of noir, but the film recognised how deep the tradition of police corruption runs in LA, and that made it as outrageous as today's headlines. </p> <p><strong>From page to screen</strong></p> <p><strong>Out of the Past</strong> (1947): It was the little-known British pulp writer Frank Fenton who put some structural backbone into this adaptation of Daniel Mainwaring's flabby novel, Build My Gallows High. He rounded out the characters, made them believable and, after the comment \"She can't be all bad - no one is\", provided Robert Mitchum's punchline: \"She comes the closest.\" </p> <p><strong> Kiss Me Deadly</strong> (1955): Robert Aldrich's film simultaneously exploits and ridicules Mickey Spillane's high-octane novel. Spillane's hero, Mike Hammer, still engages in his trademark roughhousing, but Aldrich lifts the earthbound Hammer into the ethereal with his final scene: Spillane's conventional black bag containing money from a drug deal becomes a Pandora's box - the bomb that defined the mid-50s blows up into a nuclear noir. </p> <p><strong>Point Blank</strong> (1967): The film that launched neo-noir is based on one of a series of novels written by Donald Westlake under the pen-name Richard Stark. The pulp writer said: \"This is a rare instance of where the auteur theory works; John Boorman took a mediocre script and turned it into a terrific movie.\" </p> <p><strong>The Grifters</strong> (1990): In the late 80s, not a month seemed to go by without a screen adaptation of one of Jim Thompson's novels. But this sun-streaked, bleached noir was the only one worthy of the \"dime-store Dostoyevsky\". So how was the pulp-meister's work adapted and updated? \"It was easy,\" says Donald Westlake. \"I took their hats off.\" </p> <p><strong>Get Carter</strong> (1971): It was the way Mike Hodges brought Ted Lewis's novel Jack's Return Home to the screen that earned this film its cult status. Newcastle replaces nowhere specific in the book, Carter is toughened up - he no longer bites his nails - and, in spite of pressure from MGM, who wanted a sequel, and in contrast to the book, Carter dies - thus ensuring his immortality. </p> <p><strong>The bottom line</strong></p> <p><strong> Fred MacMurray </strong>saying goodbye after meeting Barbara Stanwyck's sinuous siren in Double Indemnity: \"Will you be here? Same chair, same perfume, same anklet?\" \"I wonder if I know what you mean.\" \"I wonder if you wonder.\" </p> <p>Bogart's <strong>Sam Spade</strong> to Mary Astor's femme fatale in The Maltese Falcon: \"I won't play the sap for you. If I send you over, I'll be sorry as hell. I'll have some rotten nights - but that'll pass.\" </p> <p>The private eye, <strong>Bradford Galt</strong>, at bay in The Dark Corner: \"I'm backed up in a dark corner and I don't know who's hitting me.\" </p> <p><strong>Kathie</strong>, the devious dame in Out of the Past, appealing to Robert Mitchum: \"I don't want to die.\" \"Neither do I, baby - but if I have to, I'm going to die last.\" </p> <p>A dying <strong>Richard Widmark</strong> to Cornell Wilde after he's been shot by Ida Lupino's torch singer in Road House: \"I told you she was different.\" </p> <p>John Garfield's <strong>Mob lawyer</strong> in Force of Evil: \"I didn't have enough strength to resist corruption but I had enough strength to fight for a piece of it.\" </p> <p><strong>Marlene Dietrich</strong> greeting an oversized, padded-up, false-nosed Orson Welles in Touch of Evil: \"You're a mess, honey. You've been eating too much candy.\" </p> <p>A young <strong>Charles Bronson</strong> to his boss, after levelling his gun at an interfering woman in Crime Wave: \"You want I should clip a curl off the cutie?\" </p> <p><strong>Easy Rawlins </strong>in Devil in a Blue Dress: \"When somebody tells me ain't nothing to worry about, I usually look down to see if my fly is open.\" </p> <p>Roman Polanski's <strong>hood</strong>, poking a switchblade up Jack Nicholson's nostril in Chinatown: \"You know what happens to nosy fellows? They lose their noses.\" </p> <p>Kathleen Turner's <strong>femme fatale</strong>, Matty Walker, to Racine, the patsy in Body Heat: \"You're not too smart, are you?\" \"No.\" \"I like that in a man.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Crime Scene 2000 runs at London's NFT from July 14-16.

We've got the flashy restaurants and nightclubs they run, and the hotels and apartment houses they own, and the grifters and con men and female bandits that live in them. The riffraff of a big hard-boiled city with no more personality than a paper cup.\" But that was then - the time of chain-smoking loners in the rain-slicked streets of film noir's heyday in the 40s and early 50s. What is noir now? And, more to the point, why does it never die? The answer is paranoia. The fear - especially during the Reagan/Thatcher years of the late 80s - that the world was, in fact, not on an extended 50s rerun of \"be happy\" innocence, that Reagan's \"City on the Hill\" was at best a mirage, at worst a tip or, as the downbeat noir novelist Jim Thompson suggested in the 50s, \"Things are not what they seem.\" Because, like its grumpy, grizzled grandfather, today's film noir is paranoid, nihilistic, maybe even sadistic. The world it inhabits looks out of kilter and dangerous; there are shadows everywhere, and garish swatches of brightness - usually coming out of gun barrels. Yet the actors aren't just framed in darkness, they're shrouded in it - or sliced by the stabbing shadows of venetian blinds. But noir isn't just a style, an art director's plundering of pre-war French and German movies. It's wisecracking and know-it-all but with something romantic in it too. In all the best noir movies, there's a yearning for something more. Film noir - and, for that matter, neo-noir - tells us that by refusing the illusion of solace and sentimentality, by looking into the shadows, we may find something more solid and trustworthy than anything our pipe dreams can offer us. Because films noirs are visions in the dark. They are our voluptous nightmares. Classic Noir The Maltese Falcon (1941): The first and and some say the finest noir, John Huston's debut movie gave Humphrey Bogart his most exciting role. Even after a dozen viewings, Bogart's Sam Spade shocks us with his sudden outburts of greed and rage, with his shifts between self-interest and moral rectitude and back again. That is the film's strength and the reason why it defined film noir - good and evil are handcuffed together in all its characters. Murder, My Sweet (1945): Based on Raymond Chandler's Farewell, My Lovely, this film's use of shadows, mirrors and disorienting fogs - not to mention venetian blinds - gave noir its visual style. Curiously, Chandler thought that its star, the ex-crooner Dick Powell, rather than Bogart, came closest to his conception of Philip Marlowe. Double Indemnity (1944): The result of an uneasy alliance between three of noir's greatest names, Double Indemnity was taken from a James M Cain novel, directed by Billy Wilder and adapted by Wilder and Raymond Chandler. And it's got everything: style, sex and murder. There are no happy endings in noir, but who wouldn't kill for Barbara Stanwyck's femme fatale? The Big Heat (1953): The director, Fritz Lang, is the link between film noir and its visual roots in German expressionism, but it's the sadism in The Big Heat that poleaxes you - from a hero imbued with obsession and loneliness to the heavy played by Lee Marvin rearing back from his scarred moll after he's thrown scalding coffee in her face. Touch of Evil (1958): In a famous essay, director Paul Schrader says this movie is \"film noir's epitaph\". But what a way to bow out. By then noir had been whitewashed and transplanted to TV shows like Dragnet but this lurid, flamboyantly exhibitionist thriller from Orson Welles is as palpably nasty as the murky waters of the canal featured in its deadly climax. Neo-noir Chinatown (1974): In Robert Towne's original script, Evelyn (played by Faye Dunaway) shoots her father and is saved from jail by JJ Gittes (Jack Nicholson). But director Roman Polanski insisted that the forces of darkness were unbeatable. No one makes any difference, and Gittes' meddling probably only makes matters worse. Polanski, as Towne said, \"saw the darkness at the end of the tunnel\". Night Moves (1975): Noir in the 70s was about deflating myths and puncturing film genres, and one of the most effective deflators was Arthur Penn. Here, the shamus (Gene Hackman) has a fatal flaw. He needs to know the facts, the answers. But Hackman can't save anyone, much less himself. His increasing frustration is the film's message: to search for the truth is futile. Body Heat (1981): This is a film noir about a man who's seen too many films noirs, a dim Florida attorney who, in time-honoured noir tradition, gets trapped by a beautiful, mysterious woman into murdering her husband. Though the film clings almost too closely to the femme fatale's coat-tails, Lawrence Kasdan's steamy, sex-driven camera takes you back to the slinky, good old, bad old days. Devil in a Blue Dress (1995): An underrated urban drama with a difference, a neo-noir about outsiders - African-Americans, non-fatal femmes and, most of all, its hero, Easy Rawlins, straddling the \"color line\" in late-40s LA. \"Nervous?\" asks the heroine. \"Here I was in the middle of the night,\" says Easy, \"in a white neighborhood with a white woman in my car. Naw, I wasn't nervous. I was stupid.\" LA Confidential (1997): A high-low conspiracy writ large, Curtis Hanson's movie lacked the ruthless bite of James Ellroy's original novel. More a nostalgic homage than a searing rejuvenation of noir, but the film recognised how deep the tradition of police corruption runs in LA, and that made it as outrageous as today's headlines. From page to screen Out of the Past (1947): It was the little-known British pulp writer Frank Fenton who put some structural backbone into this adaptation of Daniel Mainwaring's flabby novel, Build My Gallows High. He rounded out the characters, made them believable and, after the comment \"She can't be all bad - no one is\", provided Robert Mitchum's punchline: \"She comes the closest.\" Kiss Me Deadly (1955): Robert Aldrich's film simultaneously exploits and ridicules Mickey Spillane's high-octane novel. Spillane's hero, Mike Hammer, still engages in his trademark roughhousing, but Aldrich lifts the earthbound Hammer into the ethereal with his final scene: Spillane's conventional black bag containing money from a drug deal becomes a Pandora's box - the bomb that defined the mid-50s blows up into a nuclear noir. Point Blank (1967): The film that launched neo-noir is based on one of a series of novels written by Donald Westlake under the pen-name Richard Stark. The pulp writer said: \"This is a rare instance of where the auteur theory works; John Boorman took a mediocre script and turned it into a terrific movie.\" The Grifters (1990): In the late 80s, not a month seemed to go by without a screen adaptation of one of Jim Thompson's novels. But this sun-streaked, bleached noir was the only one worthy of the \"dime-store Dostoyevsky\". So how was the pulp-meister's work adapted and updated? \"It was easy,\" says Donald Westlake. \"I took their hats off.\" Get Carter (1971): It was the way Mike Hodges brought Ted Lewis's novel Jack's Return Home to the screen that earned this film its cult status. Newcastle replaces nowhere specific in the book, Carter is toughened up - he no longer bites his nails - and, in spite of pressure from MGM, who wanted a sequel, and in contrast to the book, Carter dies - thus ensuring his immortality. The bottom line Fred MacMurray saying goodbye after meeting Barbara Stanwyck's sinuous siren in Double Indemnity: \"Will you be here? Same chair, same perfume, same anklet?\" \"I wonder if I know what you mean.\" \"I wonder if you wonder.\" Bogart's Sam Spade to Mary Astor's femme fatale in The Maltese Falcon: \"I won't play the sap for you. If I send you over, I'll be sorry as hell. I'll have some rotten nights - but that'll pass.\" The private eye, Bradford Galt, at bay in The Dark Corner: \"I'm backed up in a dark corner and I don't know who's hitting me.\" Kathie, the devious dame in Out of the Past, appealing to Robert Mitchum: \"I don't want to die.\" \"Neither do I, baby - but if I have to, I'm going to die last.\" A dying Richard Widmark to Cornell Wilde after he's been shot by Ida Lupino's torch singer in Road House: \"I told you she was different.\" John Garfield's Mob lawyer in Force of Evil: \"I didn't have enough strength to resist corruption but I had enough strength to fight for a piece of it.\" Marlene Dietrich greeting an oversized, padded-up, false-nosed Orson Welles in Touch of Evil: \"You're a mess, honey. You've been eating too much candy.\" A young Charles Bronson to his boss, after levelling his gun at an interfering woman in Crime Wave: \"You want I should clip a curl off the cutie?\" Easy Rawlins in Devil in a Blue Dress: \"When somebody tells me ain't nothing to worry about, I usually look down to see if my fly is open.\" Roman Polanski's hood, poking a switchblade up Jack Nicholson's nostril in Chinatown: \"You know what happens to nosy fellows? They lose their noses.\" Kathleen Turner's femme fatale, Matty Walker, to Racine, the patsy in Body Heat: \"You're not too smart, are you?\" \"No.\" \"I like that in a man.\" \u0095 Crime Scene 2000 runs at London's NFT from July 14-16.
