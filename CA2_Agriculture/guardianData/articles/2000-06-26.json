      "bodyText": "A close ally of the prime minister, Tony Blair, last night damned the civil service for its white domination. Lord Alli said progress among senior mandarins was so slow that it would take nearly two centuries for ethnic minorities to be fairly represented at the top of the civil service . Giving the annual Greenwich Lecture in London in memory of three murdered black students, including Stephen Lawrence, Lord Alli said senior civil servants prided themselves on being meritocratic. \"But they are to a man - and woman - white,\" said the millionaire business man. \"Put at its clearest - and bluntest - 0% of the very top civil servants are black. \"There are no black permanent secretaries. There are no black ambassadors. Is this a reflection of the world we live in?\" Lord Alli said the time had come for Britain to have its first black ambassador and called for a \"step change\" in the slow progress in promoting black talent. Just 1.7% of the top 3,000 civil servants are black or Asian, compared to over 5% of the working population. Lord Alli said: \"At the current rate it will take 190 years before our communities are fairly represented in the most senior ranks of the civil ser vice. We cannot wait that long.\" He added: \"My challenge now to government ministers - black and white - is to take the action needed to deliver what we promised. Put the undoubted energy and intelligence of your senior civil servants into seeking out black talent. \"And if you cannot find a suitable candidate to be Britain's first black ambassador or permanent secretary, let us help you find the right people to do these jobs.\" Recent Cabinet Office figures show that the proportion of black and Asian top civil servants fell between from 1.8% in 1989 to 1.7% in 1999. The government has vowed to double the number by 2005 to 3.2% amid allegations that the \"old boy network\" is hampering progress. The government figures showed that black and Asian staff were paid up to pounds 3,500 less than white colleagues, and were more likely to resign . A Cabinet Office spokeswoman would not respond directly to Lord Alli's attack but said: \"We have a strong commitment to equal opportunities and we value the diversity of our staff. \"We fully recognise that people from ethnic minorities are underepresented at senior levels, that is why a key part of the programme to modernise the civil service is to achieve a dramatic increase in diversity and to tackle under representation. \"We therefore set challenging targets to double the representation of ethnic minorities in the senior civil service by 2005.\" Lord Alli also attacked the Conservative leader, William Hague, over his demands for tougher asylum and immigration policies. He suggested he was worse than Enoch Powell. Lord Alli also called for a new \"contract\" between the black population in London and the Metropolitan police. This would involve the Met giving commitments to the black community and, in return, receiving more encouragement for young blacks to join the force.",

One investor said: \"This is, in broad terms, a takeover by Warner but they don't have the guts to make an offer.\" Another shareholder, John Farmer, said: \"If you and your board are as good as you would have us believe, it is surely a mistake to relinquish that control.\" Mr Nicoli defended the deal, saying it would create \"the world's premier music company\", with the firepower to take advantage of new distribution channels using the internet. He said the transaction was structured as a partnership for tax reasons, and he suggested the make-up of the board was unimportant because members would usually agree anyway: \"It's unlikely we'll find ourselves voting very often, if ever.\" The meeting was packed with several hundred investors at the Waldorf Hotel in central London. Nearly all the speakers were opposed to the deal. One said: \"I just don't see why it's advantageous to shareholders and to the industry as a whole.\" Mr Nicoli insisted the transaction had received \"overwhelming support\" from EMI's employees and from artists on the group's books - who include the Spice Girls, Robbie Williams and David Bowie. However, he admitted 2,000 redundancies were likely when one shareholder asked: \"How many of the employees who've given you overwhelming support are going to be laid off?\" EMI cannot complete the deal until it receives approval from the European Commission, which has launched an investigation expected to last up to four months. Mr Nicoli said he was \"absolutely confident\" any competition concerns could be addressed. He insisted that the group had heard nothing about a bid from a rival consortium, tipped to include the US private equity firm Hicks Muse, Spanish telecoms company Telefonica, German media group Bertelsmann and Hong Kong's Pacific Century Cyberworks. Proxy votes from institutional shareholders meant the deal was approved and EMI's shares rose 15.5p to 656p.",

That was in the 1986 World Cup final in a game that summed him up as a player: in the first half he gave as good as he got from Diego Maradona; in the second half he freed up and became the intelligent multi-faceted player we all know him to be. </p> <p>He had the spirit of a stoker in an engine-room and the depth of vision of an architect: this made him the most typically German player of the last 20 years. </p> <p>But his flaw, like that of the German team as a whole, was to keep going beyond his time. Germany is going through a period of harsh criticism but Matth\u00e4us has a long series of great results to defend himself with. </p> <p>Hagi is a national hero who means so much for Romanian football that the only thing he has not done yet is play football while mounted on a white horse. With his persistence and sense of vision he could continue playing until he was 100, but with this disadvantage: his team-mates would be overly ready to distort their game in order to give him the ball. </p> <p>He was like a magnet that sucked the life out of his team's game and they actually played their best without him. He took a walk on his worst side during the game against Italy: one of his shots hit the post, he intentionally gave Conte a knock on the knee, he faked a penalty and, when a TV camera closed in on him en route to the changing rooms, he shouted at it in frustration. </p> <p>It was all very shoddy but he does have an alibi: for almost 20 years he has been a marvellous player. </p> <p>Both of them did something extremely normal in this ill-mannered, low-budget game: they left football by the tradesmen's entrance in order to join the history books by the front door. </p> <p><strong> Who dares</strong><br>It is very difficult for Italy to get confused because their football has very few ingredients to it: a lot of players behind the ball, constant pressure and a fast counter-attack with long balls once they regain possession. </p> <p>Filippo Inzaghi zooms forward (unless he is stopped by the linesman), Francesco Totti comes up from behind (doing as much as he can within some strict limits) and the attacking manoeuvre is backed up by one of Demetrio Albertini's two shield-bearers, Stefano Fiore or Antonio Conte. (If they both attack at the same time, it is potentially lethal.) </p> <p>They are the ace, king and queen of the Italian game, all armed to the teeth with a murderous self-confidence. </p> <p>If one considers Italy as a team, one needs only to ask oneself how they attacked and how they defended. It is irrelevant to think about how they actually played. </p> <p>An Italian friend of mine says that he never gets nervous watching his side in action. He is right not to do so but the way Italy play reminds me of those mothers who prefer their kids to rot away their youth inside the family homes: outside, as everybody knows, there is a violent world full of temptations, not to mention flowerpots poised to fall off balconies on to their heads as they pass by underneath. </p> <p>Portugal's game, on the other hand, has far more links in its chain, which makes it much more risky and open to attack. If they start an offensive from a long way back they can lose the ball, as happened when Fernando Couto gave the Turks a penalty. If they dribble the ball for a long way up the pitch, their playing style gets cramped, as happened when Turkey were reduced to 10 men. </p> <p>If they do not play down the wings, their game ends up losing its speed and Luis Figo becomes irrelevant, something that occurs all too frequently when they get edgy because they need a quick goal. </p> <p>I could go on and on about all these failings and risk-takings, the practical (and cynical) answer to all of which would be that it is regrettable but inevitable. But then I could tell a completely different story about all of Portugal's virtues, a team who love adventure for its own sake, something that makes them beguiling to watch. Italy's style is completely legitimate but Portugal's has greatness: that is the difference between them.</p>",

Both of them did something extremely normal in this ill-mannered, low-budget game: they left football by the tradesmen's entrance in order to join the history books by the front door. Who dares It is very difficult for Italy to get confused because their football has very few ingredients to it: a lot of players behind the ball, constant pressure and a fast counter-attack with long balls once they regain possession. Filippo Inzaghi zooms forward (unless he is stopped by the linesman), Francesco Totti comes up from behind (doing as much as he can within some strict limits) and the attacking manoeuvre is backed up by one of Demetrio Albertini's two shield-bearers, Stefano Fiore or Antonio Conte. (If they both attack at the same time, it is potentially lethal.) They are the ace, king and queen of the Italian game, all armed to the teeth with a murderous self-confidence. If one considers Italy as a team, one needs only to ask oneself how they attacked and how they defended. It is irrelevant to think about how they actually played. An Italian friend of mine says that he never gets nervous watching his side in action. He is right not to do so but the way Italy play reminds me of those mothers who prefer their kids to rot away their youth inside the family homes: outside, as everybody knows, there is a violent world full of temptations, not to mention flowerpots poised to fall off balconies on to their heads as they pass by underneath. Portugal's game, on the other hand, has far more links in its chain, which makes it much more risky and open to attack. If they start an offensive from a long way back they can lose the ball, as happened when Fernando Couto gave the Turks a penalty. If they dribble the ball for a long way up the pitch, their playing style gets cramped, as happened when Turkey were reduced to 10 men. If they do not play down the wings, their game ends up losing its speed and Luis Figo becomes irrelevant, something that occurs all too frequently when they get edgy because they need a quick goal. I could go on and on about all these failings and risk-takings, the practical (and cynical) answer to all of which would be that it is regrettable but inevitable. But then I could tell a completely different story about all of Portugal's virtues, a team who love adventure for its own sake, something that makes them beguiling to watch. Italy's style is completely legitimate but Portugal's has greatness: that is the difference between them.",

As the bodies were being removed from the building, an English backpacker who featured on a victims list in Australia turned up alive. Nicola Morgan approached the police today after attending the memorial service for the dead yesterday. The Foreign Office said she had never appeared on their list of missing victims, but was reported to have been a victim of the blaze in Australia. \"It certainly seems that she contacted her parents soon after the fire, but we cannot be sure. We are just glad she is safe and well,\" spokeswoman Katy Parker said. Six British nationals and one Irish national remain unaccounted for. \"We have spoken to their families, but we are still awaiting confirmation when the bodies are recovered and identified,\" said Miss Parker. She said it was likely that the earliest the bodies could be formerly identified is tomorrow. A police spokesman said that eight bodies have yet to be retrieved from the building. \"This is a slow and painstaking process,\" he said. \"The teams are working in cramped, dangerous conditions and we are finding it is taking about one and a half to two hours per body.\" The cause of the blaze, which is known to have started on the ground floor of the two-storey building, is still being treated as suspicious. The 70 survivors were yesterday joined by local residents, politicians and rescuers in an emotional memorial service.",

      "bodyText": "In Boston recently, I was visiting WGBH, the flagship station of the US Public Broadcasting System (PBS), where I came across the preparations for an auction to raise funds for the channel. The volunteers lining up at trestle tables appeared more akin to a church jumble sale than an important component in the economics of a major television station. The point is that here was a group of citizens who cared as passionately about their public service television station as their local school. Pledge weeks in which viewers donate to PBS have been a a part of the funding base of the system for many years and, in case you think this is irrelevant, WGBH co-produce a huge amount of classic British drama as well as making current affairs and science programmes of high ambition. When Newt Gingrich tried to destroy PBS funding a few years ago, it was viewers all over the country, the equivalents of those Boston volunteers, who turned the tide against \"nuking Newt\". PBS, like public sector broadcasters all over the world, is wrestling with a fundamental question. Should it compete with commercial services or stay distinctive by offering viewers unique programmes? In Britain, the fierce bidding for soccer rights has highlighted that dilemma for the BBC, and Mark Thompson's radical Banff speech (which David Elstein wrote about here last week) has indicated where their intentions lie. The war over ITV's news has only served to highlight the confusion surrounding the role of public service on all channels. On Friday, broadcasters and other interested parties handed in their evidence for the Communications Bill White Paper. Here the shape of broadcasting will be hammered out but underpinning almost every clause in the bill will be one key issue. Public service broadcasting now needs to be framed in a multi-channel landscape with internet access. And finding a new definition will be as difficult as catching blancmange. Crucial judgments affecting all channels will be informed by the future framework as defined by public service obligations. What is the role of news on ITV when there are four 24/7-news channels? How far should the BBC's commercial partnerships stretch? What is the Channel 4 remit when it expands into more entertainment-based channels? In the digital world the anchor points of public service broadcasting will be ever more important. In the gold rush of commercial services, impartial information, cultural access, educational opportunity and indigenous drama and entertainment should be there for all. Social exclusion is almost as relevant to information as it is to jobs or housing. Digital division is a significant obstacle in the new media world. Andrew Graham and Gavyn Davies were right when they wrote: \"Public service broadcasting is not an optional add-on but central to the health of all broadcasting.\" This is the same Andrew Graham who will be advising the government on this issue as White Paper submissions are assessed. The BBC's obsession with market measurement, now imported in part into Channel 4, has meant that for too long public service broadcasting has been defined in a mechanistic way. It was as if efficiency and focus groups had replaced creativity and diversity as key elements of public service broadcasting's genetic make-up. Serving the viewer is more than audience measurement, \"value\" in public service broadcasting is more than value for money. Walking with Dinosaurs, Warriors, The 1900 House, Elizabeth, The Murder of Stephen Lawrence and The Royle Family, show that good programme-making of ambition can still make commercial and cultural value indivisible. The underlying core principle of universality of access laid down by John Reith in 1924 still applies but we should delete \"broadcasting\" from the phrase public service broadcasting because the concept should now be enshrined in much more than conventional television. New technology merely offers a different delivery mechanism for public service functions. News, education, regionalism, community debate, participation and internationalism are renewed opportunities in the new world. When access is fast, cheap and universal there is a huge potential for a more interactive, more democratic form of public service than in old media. I hope that, as the crucial debate hots up, the notion of public service broadcasting is not trapped in history but rather redefined for the future.

The raw data is not being patented but patents are being granted on data that has been identified as a gene and for which the function is known to some extent. Celera has made 6,500 patent applications. What next? The information unveiled today is a mass of raw data that, were it typed on single spaced on A4 paper, would fill 750,000 pages. In the years ahead scientists will try to interpret this data, which could be used to find cures for a range of diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's, haemophilia, cystic fibrosis and heart disease. Some forecast that we may one day be looking at a way to stop ageing. In Japan, a research group has announced it will sequence the entire genome of humankind's nearest relative, the chimpanzee, in the hope of shedding light on the origins of language, logic and thinking. Is decoding the genome a good thing? Critics argue that housing, prosperity, education and improved nutrition have done more to improve human health in the last 100 years than radically improved medicine. Others raise the fear that decoding the genome will lead to a form of eugenics whereby tests on unborn babies will reveal a range of diseases and lead to an increase in terminations of \"defective\" babies. Another fear is that genetic tests that pinpoint inherited (and maybe incurable) diseases will lead to insurance companies charging high premiums on those deemed at high risk of developing conditions such as Huntington's or cancer.",

      "body": "<p>It's a guilt trip that most of us have made. It's the middle of the night, you've got 200 miles to go, and you're knackered. There's a service station a couple of miles ahead; Knutsford services, however, isn't quite your idea of an enticing place to stop. Besides, the road ahead is empty, and most of the police have knocked off for the evening. Of course you can make it.</p> <p>However, as is becoming increasingly apparent, your chances of success may be lower than you think. Because it is emerging that the chief cause of road deaths is not booze, drugs, excessive speed or mobile phones; it is good old-fashioned fatigue.</p> <p>The seriousness of the problem is highlighted by new research carried out at Loughborough University. Using a custom-built driving simulator in the university's sleep laboratory, Professor Jim Horne and his team have been subjecting volunteers to a series of tests to discover how their road-handling skills were affected by lack of sleep.</p> <p>My experience showed just how risky the game can be. The night before my test I went to bed, as instructed, at 2am. Next morning, at the sleep laboratory, after the prescribed four hours and 50 minutes' sleep, I was festooned in electronic ligaments that feed eye movement and evidence of brain activity back to the monitors. Thus wired, I got into the cabin and began my virtual motorway drive to oblivion.</p> <p>Just 30 minutes in, I was starting to flag. The technical assistant would periodically shout, \"Sleep check!\" whereupon I would be expected to give a rating of one to 10 (10 being perky, one being zonked) supplemented by an A to E (A meaning you don't expect to fall asleep in the next five minutes, E indicating you're comatose). Within a few miles, I'd moved from the relative safety of being an 8A to the sleep-infested waters of a 7C. But when I watched the video afterwards, I could see that I was more of a 5D - head leaning back against the headrest in a pathetic attempt to disguise my desire to flop.</p> <p>I was not the only one to disgrace myself. After my test, Professor Horne showed me the tape of another subject (let's call him Patient X). Head lopped over, eyes rolled back, foot to the floor, Patient X was doing a steady 70. The vibrations from the hard shoulder rumble strip were pulsing through the cabin, but still he slumbered, arms hanging loosely from the steering wheel. After 15 minutes, he stirred, lifted his leaden lids and said he was feeling better. Soon afterwards, however, he was back in a slumber, charging on, eyes wide shut.</p> <p>Having professed a tendency to doze off, Patient X had been a willing guinea pig for Horne's experiments. But he was so embarrassed by the recorded footage that he insisted that his identity be protected.</p> <p>Horne's full test goes on for two to three hours and participants take it four times. His \"success\" rate would have the makers of Mogadon and Classic FM compilations seething with resentment; in the cosy, dark confines of a sawn-off Vauxhall Cavalier, after five hours' sleep, you have only a 10% chance of staying fully awake for a lengthy journey.</p> <p>The proportion of people who fall asleep is not the only surprising statistic. Forget the image of doddery old ladies nodding off at the traffic lights; the highest risk group is that of male drivers aged under 30. And no matter what your age or gender, driving between 2am and 6am puts a spanner in your body clock, because at this time our bodies are programmed to sleep. Age is more likely to be a factor in the daytime; the older you are, the more susceptible you are to the corollary of the \"afternoon dip\", the time when most Europeans have wisely gone back to bed. And if you're a student, journalist, nurse, sales rep, commercial driver, doctor, pilot or night-shift worker, you're even more likely to suffer from drowsiness at the wheel.</p> <p>The annual report on road accidents by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions revealed that 3,500 deaths occurred on Britain's roads in the year to 1998. Of these, police believe, SRVAs, or sleep-related vehicle accidents, claimed more lives than drink-driving. The problem is becoming so familiar to emergency services working on motorways and trunk roads that nicknames have been coined. Part of the M6 is called \"the Sleepy Corridor\" and the M1 at Boot Hill in Northants has become the \"Nod-off Zone\".</p> <p>As part of Professor Horne's work, researcher Diane Flatley is compiling a league table of the UK's most soporific highways, the details of which will land somewhere on a desk in the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions this autumn. Top of the list is likely to be the M180, a popular haunt of Grimsby commuters. It has recently been the setting for four fatal crashes.</p> <p>The SRVA figures are a wake-up call to road designers, many of whom seem to have overlooked the fact that if you drop drivers into a closed loop of repetitive tarmac, things will go wrong. Professor Horne wouldn't disagree - indeed, highways authorities have taken his team's advice and removed many lay-bys on gradual right-hand bends because they are a magnet not just to tired drivers but also to those who have already fallen asleep.</p> <p>Professor Horne's focus, however, is more on the driver than on the road. He believes the real issue is personal: \"People know when they are sleepy, they know if they are reaching the point of fighting sleep. But those who survive sleep-drive accidents will often say, 'I just suddenly fell asleep.' There is no truth in this. You can say, 'There but for the grace of God go I,' but there is simply no excuse for falling asleep at the wheel. We know the signs, but we choose to ignore them.\"</p> <p>So what can be done to reduce your chances of succumbing to sleep? \"Everyone has their own pet theory,\" says Horne. \"We try all sorts of things, from turning up the radio, opening the window, chewing lemons and taking your shoes off. But there's no escape - if you're tired, you can even fall asleep with your eyes open.\" With luck, these results may help the DETR to formulate a sleep-drive rule equivalent to the recommendations on drinking and driving.</p> <p>One of the likely guidelines is that five hours is not enough. Anything less than 300 minutes' sleep gives you Margaret Thatcher eyes and puts you on the cusp of sleep deprivation. Later that day, drive for more than two hours and the chances are that you'll feel the onset of fatigue - as 90% of Horne's guinea pigs did. (If, by the way, you've ever felt your head dip when behind the wheel, you've satisfied the lab definition of nodding off; slack neck muscles signal an advanced stage of sleep.)</p> <p>The verdict will also nail the truth about coffee. The team has explored its potential to prevent sleepiness, but found that the all-important caffeine levels vary so widely both between and within brands that the results could not be measured. Subsequent tests of coffee at motorway service stations across Britain showed that while you need a shot of 150mg of caffeine to resharpen your senses, many service-station coffees contained no more than 30mg. So you'd need at least five cups of coffee (and a jumbo bladder) before you would be safe to drive again.</p> <p>Furthermore, no brand of coffee lists its caffeine content, which is why the lab tests on the effect of caffeine were conducted with the help of the makers of the energy drink Red Bull. Two of the slimline cans packs the required 150mg punch; the efficacy of these countermeasures, when combined with a brief nap (and double-blind-tested using a caffeine-free version), looked promising.</p> <p>\"The results are not conclusive, but are becoming more so. So much advice, like stretching your legs and getting fresh air, is a waste of time; if you're tired, the only thing worth doing is sleep - a 15-minute nap is ideal, because it stops short of deep sleep, which can leave you groggy. Take half an hour's break in all to allow time for the caffeine to take effect.\"</p> <p>All of which is helpful, but what of the prime victims, males under 30? Why are they so vulnerable to the risk of sleeping at the wheel? There is no conclusive data here, but the team have some inkling. \"Fewer women drive at the high-risk times and women are quicker to recognise that they might be sleepy in the next five minutes; men take more risks; they deny being tired and say they can get through it. If they're half an hour from home, they won't stop. Which is why some never make it.\"</p> <p>* <b> Plan your journey</b></p> <p>Avoid driving for extended periods between the hours of 2am and 5am, and in the early afternoon.

They enable the courts to threaten to jail teenagers and neighbours who indulge in persistent disorder but which falls short of full-blown criminal behaviour.</p> <p>So far only 70 orders have been made, mostly against neighbours who engage in criminal behaviour.

      "bodyText": "The home secretary, Jack Straw, is to tell the police and councils to make much greater use of anti-social behaviour orders against young thugs as part of a new drive against alcohol-fuelled violence. Mr Straw is to tell the police they do not need to wait for local authority backing before they take out the orders against loutish behaviour. They enable the courts to threaten to jail teenagers and neighbours who indulge in persistent disorder but which falls short of full-blown criminal behaviour. So far only 70 orders have been made, mostly against neighbours who engage in criminal behaviour. But the home secretary will tell the Local Government Association on Wednesday that they \"should be used swiftly where circumstances demand it, not just against the very hard cases of unacceptable behaviour\". Mr Straw confirmed yesterday that he expects the next batch of annual recorded crime figures, to be published next month, will show a sharp rise in violent crime - possibly by up to 19% and a 3.8% rise in all recorded crime over the past year. \"We have a general problem of drink-related violence in our society, particularly amongst younger men, which we have got to deal with, and it's one of the reasons why the violent crime figures are going up,\" Mr Straw told BBC1's Breakfast with Frost yesterday. \"When crime goes up, it's not good news, of course ... What we have got is a particular problem in our society, which we all have to talk about and deal with, which is of drink-related violence. We have also, in some of the main cities, London, Birmingham, Manchester and so on, got problems of street crime. We have put \u00a320m into those police forces to be able to target the robbers.\" The home secretary renewed his call to the crown courts to follow the guidance of the court of appeal and pass much tougher sentences on those convicted of street robbery. He said recent figures showed that sentences for street robbery were becoming shorter on average while prison terms for every other offence were getting longer. The Home Office is also to bring in measures to tackle the link between drink and violent crime including ending uniform closing times and cracking down hard on rogue landlords. Shadow home secretary Ann Widdecombe said the expected rise in the violent crime figures wasn't surprising \"when police numbers have fallen sharply, when violent prisoners are being let out before their due release date, and when the automatic life sentence, which we introduced for a second serious violent offence, is accompanied by low tariffs\". \u0095Police cadet forces could be introduced in secondary schools under plans being considered by the Conservatives.

      "body": "<p><strong>SIR MISS-A-LOT</strong></p> <p>\"Curses!\" This very noise echoed around the corridors of Castle Milosevic last night as the ungainly lord of the manor struggled to come to terms with events. He, Savo Milosevic, had gone into that day's quarter-final against Holland as the leading scorer at Euro 2000 with four goals - and he scored again taking his total to... hang on a second... five. But, at the same time, that Patrick Kluivert goes and scores four goals to take him to six for the tournament. The hairy oracle of Osijek said nothing about that! Graaarrr!</p> <p>As night settled itself into a comfortable position, Savo travelled to see the oracle and berate her with his big bumfluff moustache. Through wind and rain he rode and over hill and crag, but never did he waver from his path and at long last he arrived in the town. Savo asked the locals where to find the oracle. None would respond and he was on the verge of giving up when a shadowy figure appeared from behind a nearby Inn, the Cow's Arse and Banjo. \"I am the hairy witch woman you seek,\" said the voice. \"But you needn't have bothered, cos Uefa have decided that Kluivert's third was an own-goal off of Dejan Govedarica - you're joint top scorer again.\"</p> <p>Savo closed his eyes for a moment to soak in the news, and when he opened them the witch had gone. Joint top scorer, and still with a chance to claim the boot of gold, Savo was pleased with himself as his horse headed off into the buffeting rain (it was eating cheese on sticks and a slice of broccoli quiche). As the countryside rolled by, Savo counted his luck and pledged his allegiance anew to the god of tap-ins.</p> <p>Tomorrow: Sinisa Mihajlovic goes in search of the missing central defender (only to find that it's him).</p> <p><strong>BOBBY ROBSON SPEAKS</strong></p> <p>Dear me. You should see the amount of work I've got on at the moment. I've enough on my plate being openly laughed at by Sideshow Bob, Terry Venables and Glenn Hoddle on ITV's Euro 2000 football show, so the last thing I needed was a big pile of jobs to be getting on with at Newcastle. I'm 67, you know.</p> <p>Don't get me wrong. It's good news that 26-year-old Argentinian striker Daniel Cordone has agreed to join us from Racing Club in a one-year \u00a3500,000 deal with the option of a two-year extension. But have I got time to talk to the press about it? I have not, bonny lad. So I'll just get some spokesperson to say, \"The club and the player have agreed terms and he is due to come to Newcastle this week for a medical. Subject to the medical, we believe this should go through this week.\" That's dealt with that.</p> <p>Now look at this! I've flipping got to sell Alessandro Pistone. I don't really want to lose the big Italian defender, but Everton's \u00a33m bid was far too good to turn down. I'll tell you this, mind - the press can whistle if they think I'm explaining this one away. That spokesperson can just say, \"The clubs have agreed terms and it is now down to the player. He's due to speak to Everton this week and we'll take it from there.\" Done and dusted.</p> <p>But there's always something else, isn't there? Little Kieron Dyer's just spent a night in hospital after being reportedly glassed in the face at a nightclub, only a day after the News of the World accused him of indulging in a spot of videotaped slap 'n' tickle. Ee, kids, eh? Tell you what, I'll just get the spokesperson to say, \"Clearly, the manager will be having words with Kieron on his return to training in July.\" Heh, heh! That gives me a couple of weeks to play with... plenty of time for a snooze, I reckon!</p> <p><strong>QUOTES OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"They've got great players without a doubt but playing the way they do is a bit risky if you ask me\" - Paolo Maldini is underwhelmed by Holland's sexy football.</p> <p>\"I would like to play a perfect match in Euro 2000.

Yes, not only are the players not arguing with themselves, they're not arguing with Johan Cruyff either.</p> <p>At the weekend, Cruyff offered the Oranje a rather stinging appraisal of their abilities: telling Kluivert he didn't do enough, Bergkamp that he was too weak, and Davids that he was an ordinary player. But after Kluivert scored a hat-trick yesterday, while Bergkamp was man of the match and Davids ran the midfield, Johan has seen fit to change his mind. The team are now \"fantastic\" and they should \"enjoy the future\", he says. Will that be possible, the Fiver wonders, with environmental disaster seemingly inevitable?</p> <p>But, for now at least, everything is cheery in the Dutch camp - and nobody suspects any gamesmanship at all on the part of Cruyff, a good pal of coach Frank Rijkaard. However, as much as the Fiver is a supporter of positive thinking, it can go too far. Here, for example, is Dutch defensive dyke (watch it) Jaap Stam speaking today: \"I felt very sorry for Phil Neville.\" Gaah! \"He's a player you can always count on and he's always there for the team. It doesn't matter where he plays, he's always backing everybody up.\" It's appreciation of your fellow pros gone mad!</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Spurs have made a \u00a32m bid for Belgian striker Emile Mpenza.

It was as if efficiency and focus groups had replaced creativity and diversity as key elements of public service broadcasting's genetic make-up. Serving the viewer is more than audience measurement, \"value\" in public service broadcasting is more than value for money. Walking with Dinosaurs, Warriors, The 1900 House, Elizabeth, The Murder of Stephen Lawrence and The Royle Family, show that good programme-making of ambition can still make commercial and cultural value indivisible. The underlying core principle of universality of access laid down by John Reith in 1924 still applies but we should delete \"broadcasting\" from the phrase public service broadcasting because the concept should now be enshrined in much more than conventional television. New technology merely offers a different delivery mechanism for public service functions. News, education, regionalism, community debate, participation and internationalism are renewed opportunities in the new world. When access is fast, cheap and universal there is a huge potential for a more interactive, more democratic form of public service than in old media. I hope that, as the crucial debate hots up, the notion of public service broadcasting is not trapped in history but rather redefined for the future. Without a cultural and economic framework in which to progress, some of the most valued strengths of British television are in jeopardy. Public service broadcasting needs looking after. It's like hair on a middle-aged man - by the time you've noticed it's disappeared, it's too late. John Willis is chief executive, United Productions",

      "byline": "Richard Scudamore",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The great thing about being chief executive of the Premier League is that you are never short of advice. In the course of a season it comes at you from everywhere - passions are aroused, strong views expressed. The last few weeks are no exception with added opinion deflected from the sports pages in the sale of our media rights. </p> <p>Most of the media speculation has been measured and well intentioned but Mathew Horsman's article in last week's Media Guardian was remarkable in its tone, bias and lack of understanding. The record needs to be put straight. </p> <p>When the Premier League embarked on the process of selling its media rights in January, the inevitable press speculation talked of a \u00a32bn price tag for a five-year deal. We did not fuel this estimate and rather expected to douse it by announcing that we were offering rights for a three-year term only. We have now realised over \u00a31.1bn for the live 66-game package, \u00a3328m for 40 pay-per-view games and \u00a3183m for highlights - \u00a31.645bn so far, with international rights, video on demand, mobile telephony and internet rights still to be sold. </p> <p>It is perhaps just as well we did not take Mr Horsman's advice - back in November last year he was extensively quoted in the press as saying that \u00a31bn for the subscription package was an inflated estimate: \"Something like \u00a3750m over three years might be nearer the mark,\" he said. We are grateful for the advice of others which got us over \u00a31.1bn. When we started the process it was our intention to adhere to key principles. The quality of broadcasting must exceed exacting thresholds; the Premier League brand must be safeguarded; access for viewers and promotion of the game enhanced. The process should be clear to all bidders and take account of the regulatory concerns being expressed by the office of fair trading and the European Commission. It should be kept confidential. It should allow our current partners and new entrants a fair chance. It should ensure long-term competition for the rights. We have upheld these principles. </p> <p>The first decision was to give all bidders clear guidance on the rights on offer. This was done in an invitation to tender, agreed by the clubs and issued in early April.

      "bodyText": "The great thing about being chief executive of the Premier League is that you are never short of advice. In the course of a season it comes at you from everywhere - passions are aroused, strong views expressed. The last few weeks are no exception with added opinion deflected from the sports pages in the sale of our media rights. Most of the media speculation has been measured and well intentioned but Mathew Horsman's article in last week's Media Guardian was remarkable in its tone, bias and lack of understanding. The record needs to be put straight. When the Premier League embarked on the process of selling its media rights in January, the inevitable press speculation talked of a \u00a32bn price tag for a five-year deal. We did not fuel this estimate and rather expected to douse it by announcing that we were offering rights for a three-year term only. We have now realised over \u00a31.1bn for the live 66-game package, \u00a3328m for 40 pay-per-view games and \u00a3183m for highlights - \u00a31.645bn so far, with international rights, video on demand, mobile telephony and internet rights still to be sold. It is perhaps just as well we did not take Mr Horsman's advice - back in November last year he was extensively quoted in the press as saying that \u00a31bn for the subscription package was an inflated estimate: \"Something like \u00a3750m over three years might be nearer the mark,\" he said. We are grateful for the advice of others which got us over \u00a31.1bn. When we started the process it was our intention to adhere to key principles. The quality of broadcasting must exceed exacting thresholds; the Premier League brand must be safeguarded; access for viewers and promotion of the game enhanced. The process should be clear to all bidders and take account of the regulatory concerns being expressed by the office of fair trading and the European Commission. It should be kept confidential. It should allow our current partners and new entrants a fair chance. It should ensure long-term competition for the rights. We have upheld these principles. The first decision was to give all bidders clear guidance on the rights on offer. This was done in an invitation to tender, agreed by the clubs and issued in early April. Bidders had to respond with qualitative descriptions of their editorial proposition and scheduling, their valuations for individual packages and the value they might place on any combinations of packages. This constituted the first round of bidding and indicated that selling different packages to different bidders would yield high values. And with the regulators wanting to see competition in the broadcasting market the Premier League would face the serious probability of regulatory intervention if, with a totally exclusive arrangement, we ignored several qualified bidders who were prepared to buy our rights. Once we knew there was serious competition for the packages and that we could meet regulatory concerns our course was clear. We recommended a further round of sealed bids. We also stated that if the bids were close we would go to further rounds to establish a definitive winner. The idea that we would not consider a second round is wrong and a misunderstanding of the process. It was in fact each winning bid being sufficiently clear of the runner-up that rendered further rounds obsolete. The club chairmen unanimously agreed with the process. The winning bids in June were all significantly higher than those submitted in the first round in May, including any received for a combined or \"exclusive\" bid.

      "trailText": "<p>As the PA's launch of the virtual newscaster Ananova shows, the internet is forcing once-shy news agencies into the limelight. How will they adapt, asks  Elen Lewis</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>News agencies such as Reuters have traditionally been one of the best-kept secrets of the media industry. However, the growth of the internet is set to change all that. Over the past year, driven by the digital age, both Reuters and its local UK competitor PA have been dipping their toes into the brave new world of the consumer. </p> <p>The two media companies have reacted differently to the new economy. PA noisily launched a virtual newscaster, Ananova, before swiftly announcing its green-haired consumer brand was for sale and that it intended to consolidate its \"B2B\" (business-to-business) wholesaler role. </p> <p>Reuters has taken a different tack. It announced in February that it would invest \u00a3500m in refashioning itself into a new media company and has made a paradigm shift from B2B into a \"B2B4C\" (business-to-business for consumers) model via the internet. This entails selling its live news feeds to a large number of websites (the B2B part), which can be accessed directly by the public (the 4C part.) </p> <p>The anonymity of news agency journalists is renowned. A poignant example of this was when a Reuters journalist died while reporting on the Sierra Leone conflict in May, \"although not many people knew the name of Kurt Schork, his material ended up everywhere,\" says Rodney Pinder, head of video news at Reuters. </p> <p>Look at any daily newspaper and it is likely that a Reuters picture will be on the front or the back page. Watch international news and Reuters will probably be providing the footage. Remember the harrowing Eritrean famine pictures? The Blair baby? Reuters got there first. </p> <p>PA can also boast a string of exclusives that would not have been apparent to the man on the street. PA was first with Diana's death; it was also a PA journalist who was granted an interview with Prince William on his recent 18th birthday. </p> <p>But news agency journalists are coming out of the shadows and into the limelight. \"We're becoming far more visible as a result of the internet,\" says Pinder. Not only can the public access undiluted news via 1,000 news feeds to different websites, but the transparency of the medium ensures Reuters is credited for its pictures and copy in a way that did not exist in the traditional world. In the UK, it has linked content deals with the likes of Yahoo!, WH Smith, FT.com, Excite, AOL and Altavista. </p> <p>Thus, the 149-year-old company, whose roots lie in specialist financial services and as wholesaler to the media business, is crossing into the realm of retailer. \"We're looking to expand our client base in the B2C [business-to-consumer] and the B2B4C range,\" a spokesman says. \"Our competence fits neatly into the new world,\" says Geoffrey Wheating, Reuters' director of strategic media development. </p> <p>Consumer feedback is not something a news agency is accustomed to, but the the web enables readers to respond to news-story writers. The agency says this will help it to tweak content to suit readers. But is there not a danger that Reuters could be dumbed-down through its contact with the tabloid-loving public? \"Feedback is valuable because it provides pointers. However, our coverage won't change. Our ethos is that we exist to tell people what they don't know and what they need to know, and that wouldn't be driven in a popular market,\" says Pinder. </p> <p>PA has been more receptive to the fads of a popular market. Last April saw the debut of its \"world's first-ever virtual newscaster\" Ananova, modelled on a cross between Posh Spice, Carol Vorderman and Kylie Minogue. But PA announced its intention to spin off and sell the android before she had made her entrance on the cyber stage. Sceptics suggest that Ananova was merely a rebranding exercise that transformed PA New Media into a consumer brand. </p> <p>But Robert Simpson, PA's chief executive, insisted at the time: \"This is not another dot.com story. This is about the internet becoming an integral feature of everyday life. Most of us in the future will still be technophobes who prefer to get information from a friendly face.\" </p> <p>Besides, Ananova did not appear out of nowhere, it was a product of the five-year-old PA new media division, founded to exploit the internet. Similarly, PA already had a news site for consumers to access its news, and this boasted 10m page impressions. Ananova is a profitable business with over 100 employees and forecast revenues of \u00a323m for 2003. Before the dot.com hype floundered, it was estimated that the sale of Ananova could raise \u00a3400m: estimates are now more conservative - \u00a320m to \u00a3100m. </p> <p>She has since been joined by the BT and C5 newsreading avatar Vandrea, modelled on real newsreader Andrea Calderwood. PA's decision to spin off Ananova, aside from being a money-making exercise, was taken because the board felt (says the annual report) that Ananova conflicted with the core B2B component of the media company. \"Ananova is being sold as a consumer-facing brand so PA can go back to its roots as a wholesaler. We don't want to compete with clients - we're a B2B business. We're retreating out of the public eye,\" says a spokesman. </p> <p>The renewed focus on B2B appears to be PA's strategy for the next few years. \"PA has both the ability and the scope to develop more new media B2B ventures (particularly in sport),\" wrote the chairman Robert Simpson in his annual report, \"and we will also be alert for further joint ventures in the B2C market.\" </p> <p>PA already has a joint venture with the Trinity Mirror newspaper group in sportinglife.com, which in turn launched totalbet.com through a partnership with Tote. Apart from joint ventures, once Ananova is sold, it is unlikely PA will launch another consumer-focused product, whether it be a consumer portal or an avatar. </p> <p>It is unlikely that Reuters would launch a newsreading android to boost its presence in the public eye.

      "bodyText": "News agencies such as Reuters have traditionally been one of the best-kept secrets of the media industry. However, the growth of the internet is set to change all that. Over the past year, driven by the digital age, both Reuters and its local UK competitor PA have been dipping their toes into the brave new world of the consumer. The two media companies have reacted differently to the new economy. PA noisily launched a virtual newscaster, Ananova, before swiftly announcing its green-haired consumer brand was for sale and that it intended to consolidate its \"B2B\" (business-to-business) wholesaler role. Reuters has taken a different tack. It announced in February that it would invest \u00a3500m in refashioning itself into a new media company and has made a paradigm shift from B2B into a \"B2B4C\" (business-to-business for consumers) model via the internet. This entails selling its live news feeds to a large number of websites (the B2B part), which can be accessed directly by the public (the 4C part.) The anonymity of news agency journalists is renowned. A poignant example of this was when a Reuters journalist died while reporting on the Sierra Leone conflict in May, \"although not many people knew the name of Kurt Schork, his material ended up everywhere,\" says Rodney Pinder, head of video news at Reuters. Look at any daily newspaper and it is likely that a Reuters picture will be on the front or the back page. Watch international news and Reuters will probably be providing the footage. Remember the harrowing Eritrean famine pictures? The Blair baby? Reuters got there first. PA can also boast a string of exclusives that would not have been apparent to the man on the street. PA was first with Diana's death; it was also a PA journalist who was granted an interview with Prince William on his recent 18th birthday. But news agency journalists are coming out of the shadows and into the limelight. \"We're becoming far more visible as a result of the internet,\" says Pinder. Not only can the public access undiluted news via 1,000 news feeds to different websites, but the transparency of the medium ensures Reuters is credited for its pictures and copy in a way that did not exist in the traditional world. In the UK, it has linked content deals with the likes of Yahoo!, WH Smith, FT.com, Excite, AOL and Altavista. Thus, the 149-year-old company, whose roots lie in specialist financial services and as wholesaler to the media business, is crossing into the realm of retailer. \"We're looking to expand our client base in the B2C [business-to-consumer] and the B2B4C range,\" a spokesman says. \"Our competence fits neatly into the new world,\" says Geoffrey Wheating, Reuters' director of strategic media development. Consumer feedback is not something a news agency is accustomed to, but the the web enables readers to respond to news-story writers. The agency says this will help it to tweak content to suit readers. But is there not a danger that Reuters could be dumbed-down through its contact with the tabloid-loving public? \"Feedback is valuable because it provides pointers. However, our coverage won't change. Our ethos is that we exist to tell people what they don't know and what they need to know, and that wouldn't be driven in a popular market,\" says Pinder. PA has been more receptive to the fads of a popular market. Last April saw the debut of its \"world's first-ever virtual newscaster\" Ananova, modelled on a cross between Posh Spice, Carol Vorderman and Kylie Minogue. But PA announced its intention to spin off and sell the android before she had made her entrance on the cyber stage. Sceptics suggest that Ananova was merely a rebranding exercise that transformed PA New Media into a consumer brand. But Robert Simpson, PA's chief executive, insisted at the time: \"This is not another dot.com story. This is about the internet becoming an integral feature of everyday life. Most of us in the future will still be technophobes who prefer to get information from a friendly face.\" Besides, Ananova did not appear out of nowhere, it was a product of the five-year-old PA new media division, founded to exploit the internet. Similarly, PA already had a news site for consumers to access its news, and this boasted 10m page impressions. Ananova is a profitable business with over 100 employees and forecast revenues of \u00a323m for 2003. Before the dot.com hype floundered, it was estimated that the sale of Ananova could raise \u00a3400m: estimates are now more conservative - \u00a320m to \u00a3100m. She has since been joined by the BT and C5 newsreading avatar Vandrea, modelled on real newsreader Andrea Calderwood. PA's decision to spin off Ananova, aside from being a money-making exercise, was taken because the board felt (says the annual report) that Ananova conflicted with the core B2B component of the media company. \"Ananova is being sold as a consumer-facing brand so PA can go back to its roots as a wholesaler. We don't want to compete with clients - we're a B2B business. We're retreating out of the public eye,\" says a spokesman. The renewed focus on B2B appears to be PA's strategy for the next few years. \"PA has both the ability and the scope to develop more new media B2B ventures (particularly in sport),\" wrote the chairman Robert Simpson in his annual report, \"and we will also be alert for further joint ventures in the B2C market.\" PA already has a joint venture with the Trinity Mirror newspaper group in sportinglife.com, which in turn launched totalbet.com through a partnership with Tote. Apart from joint ventures, once Ananova is sold, it is unlikely PA will launch another consumer-focused product, whether it be a consumer portal or an avatar. It is unlikely that Reuters would launch a newsreading android to boost its presence in the public eye. However, as part of its commitment to delivering news in a multimedia format, it is likely that its reports will be injected with more personality. Last week, it signed a joint venture with an independent radio production company to supply hourly audio updates across four of its online news reports. It is currently seeking (real) newsreaders for each of the four news feeds. For its quirky \"And finally\" news report it is targeting thirtysomething males and females in its search for \"the next John Craven meets Trevor McDonald\". But, would it ever consider launching a Reuters news portal enabling readers to access its content directly rather than via its partner sites, thus becoming a pure B2C operation? The clue lies in Reuters' roots as a financial services company and in a separate department: Reuters Personal. It has announced plans to launch a personal finance portal later this year, which will tap into the consumer retail market. \"As more products go online, there is an increasingly grey area between B2B and B2C, as you get more professional users at home. In due course there will be more products that we will be providing for the business retail user but they may be for the SME [small-to-medium enterprise] environment,\" says a spokesman. As he adds, the separate brokerage subsidiary of Reuters, Instinet is set to launch an online retail arm, Instinet.com later this year. \"It is an electronic equity broker. It will provide the individual with the ability to transact with the same competitive pricing as institutional brokers are used to.\" Questions may be raised over Reuters' shift towards the consumer market, especially in the light of PA's announced return to the wholesaler business as a pure B2B operation. However, despite this insistence, PA is still operating a B2B4C operation with its news feeds to websites. As large media players use the internet to distribute content, traditional news agencies must face the general commodification of news, eating into its core business. It therefore makes sense to expand from its core offering into creating new products and accessing new audiences. \"Reuters is in an interesting position,\" says Rebecca Ulph, a Forrester analyst. \"It's not a traditional consumer-facing brand, but people have heard of it. It's in a strong position.\" \u0095 Elen Lewis is features editor of New Media Age",

      "body": "<p>As the war of words between the dusty old men of the independent television commission and the smart suits at ITV intensifies, the broadcaster which actually provides the programmes over which they are fighting is preparing to enter a new battle of its own. </p> <p>Today, ITN unveils its new 24-hour news channel, due to go on air later in the summer; also today, Sky News launches a new interactive service for digital viewers. As executives at all news organisations steel themselves for the 21st-century fight for audiences in the new-media age, the News at Ten debate begins to appear drearily parochial. </p> <p>Yet however much ITN wants to be part of this brave new world, it is trapped by the past. The PR launch of the new channel had been scheduled for this morning because ITN believed that the News at Ten issue would finally have been settled by the independent television commission last Thursday. Instead, the argument is now expected to drag on through the summer and possibly into a protracted court battle later in the year. For an organisation which is already playing catch-up, it is an unappetising prospect. </p> <p>Richard Tait, the editor of ITN, is bullish. He insists that the broadcaster's image has not been tarnished by the row, but believes that the organisation will suffer if it does not jump on to the digital bandwagon. \"I don't think our brand has eroded. But I do think that if we are not universally available, our brand will erode. Our news channel is part of the process of ensuring this doesn't happen.\" </p> <p>Tait says that the new channel is crucial to safeguard ITN's future. For while there will be an appetite for traditional news services for some time to come - and its contracts with ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 are secure for the next few years - the broadcasting landscape is on the verge of significant upheaval. \"No one is obliged to watch news programmes any more. We want to get away from the traditional notion of news services, that viewers get everything the broadcaster thinks they need, rather than what the viewer wants,\" he says. </p> <p>The channel goes on air later this month. Last week, Tait and launch editor Bill Dunlop were refusing to reveal the name of the venture, nor its line-up of presenters, nor its on-screen look - one wonders why they bothered talking about it in the first place. Perhaps they were a little embarrassed: one bright spark came up with the idea of calling it simply ITN, but that idea was dropped a few weeks ago. </p> <p>ITN later relented and named the principal faces of the channel, who will be familiar to terrestrial viewers: John Suchet and Julia Somerville will present in the morning and evening respectively, and Carol Barnes will be on air at weekends, allowing her to continue her day job at Brighton magistrates' court. (Suchet will swap studios later in the morning to slip alongside his colleague Kirsty Young for his regular slot on the ITV Lunchtime News.) </p> <p>Launching a new channel would be pointless without poaching a few names from key rivals, so there's Andrew Harvey from BBC News 24 and Leyla Day Belge from Sky News. Viewers of Sky Digital and customers of the NTL cable operator - which is a partner in the new venture - will see it from day one. Negotiations are also under way with Telewest, and ONDigital viewers will get it in the mornings. </p> <p>The format of the channel will be somewhat different from the competition. While both News 24 and Sky tend to stick to the model of a 30-minute news bulletin at the top of the hour followed by a \"back half-hour\" of business, sport or other documentary, ITN has decided to go for a rolling news service, in 15-minute loops. A key difference is that there will be one, not two on-screen presenters even in peak times. The channel's look is expected to be straightforwardly slick, with no Channel 5-type desk-perching or Jon Snow-style studio wandering. </p> <p>Material will be gathered from ITN's existing reporters and production staff, and the regular agencies, augmented by dedicated 24-hour channel staff. ITN has already set up a \"core\" group which will direct material to ITN's different outlets - principally ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5 and Euronews - and to the new channel. The system should ensure that reporters in the field are not called up by commissioners from competing programmes in the same office - a practice which is the bane of BBC reporters' lives. </p> <p>While some would say it has left it a bit late to get into 24-hour news, ITN believes it is coming to the business at exactly the right time. Not least, says Tait, advances in technology have made it less troublesome financially. \"There is no doubt that the digital technology makes it cost-effective. We have every intention of making it a commercial as well as an editorial success.\" And that doesn't mean doing everything on a shoestring: \"I don't believe the way to commercial success is through cost-cutting. It is through investment in quality journalism.\" Nevertheless, Tait refuses to say how many staff are dedicated to the channel - revealing only that at any one time, about 120 people will be working for it, including those also spending time on other outlets. </p> <p>Nick Pollard, the head of Sky News, believes it is a difficult challenge. Sky News made a small profit before the launch of BBC News 24, now it is understood to have slipped just below the red line once again. \"I think they will find it tough, because we all find it tough. It is a very competitive market. We are all already fighting hard for a small percentage of the audience.\" </p> <p>Nevertheless, says Pollard, it is the right decision for ITN to make. \"I think everybody has to assume that they have to get into different types of media. If you start from that premise, it is not that difficult to see how to advance. I think television news is quite well suited to unpredictable things, anyway.\" </p> <p>Clearly, the terrestrial landscape is changing forever. \"Even the mighty BBC1 and BBC2 may become themed channels, and the idea of 'hammocking' worthy programmes between a couple of popular programmes is out of the window, and rightly so. In general, news is bound to be marginalised on the terrestrial channels.\" </p> <p>Sky, too, is determined to stay ahead of the game. From today, viewers of Sky Digital will be able to take advantage of yet more gimmicks (sorry, interactive services) on Sky News. At the touch of a button, Sky News Active is launched and news junkies can access headlines, weather, business and showbiz news at any given moment. The technology - still in its early stages - is nevertheless impressive: a split screen comes into view with four panels showing the four options. At a flick of the Sky digital handset, viewers can call up whatever service they require, without having to wait for it to come around on the main Sky News service. Any of the four \"play school\" type windows (unfortunately for the analogy, all are square) can be replaced with a live feed, so important press conferences can be played out in full on Sky News Active while the main service continues with other stories. </p> <p>Pollard believes such developments are key for broadcasters who who don't want to be left behind. In a declaration which should be plastered on the walls of every television executive, he says: \"If we don't do it, somebody else will.\" </p> <p><strong>Bring back News at Ten, or else (er, or else what?)</strong></p> <p>Pulling on his biggest pair of Doc Martens, the independent television commission's chairman Sir Robin Biggam declared last month that he was giving ITV one last chance to come up with a plan to corral the country into watching its news. \"The uncertainty cannot be allowed to continue,\" boomed the man who once told an industry audience that his family do jigsaws at Christmas instead of watching TV. </p> <p>On Thursday, Sir Robin - his DMs buffed up for the occasion - \"got tough\" and insisted ITV move its Nightly News programme to an earlier time slot. Or so we were told. The thing was that, despite the headlines the next day, he did no such thing: no formal direction emerged from Foley Street, the ITC's London home. </p> <p>The regulator, having stepped up to the brink last month, got vertigo. To force ITV's hand at this stage would almost certainly - as this newspaper reported last week - have resulted in the network hauling the commission before the high court to explain its actions.

      "bodyText": "As the war of words between the dusty old men of the independent television commission and the smart suits at ITV intensifies, the broadcaster which actually provides the programmes over which they are fighting is preparing to enter a new battle of its own. Today, ITN unveils its new 24-hour news channel, due to go on air later in the summer; also today, Sky News launches a new interactive service for digital viewers. As executives at all news organisations steel themselves for the 21st-century fight for audiences in the new-media age, the News at Ten debate begins to appear drearily parochial. Yet however much ITN wants to be part of this brave new world, it is trapped by the past. The PR launch of the new channel had been scheduled for this morning because ITN believed that the News at Ten issue would finally have been settled by the independent television commission last Thursday. Instead, the argument is now expected to drag on through the summer and possibly into a protracted court battle later in the year. For an organisation which is already playing catch-up, it is an unappetising prospect. Richard Tait, the editor of ITN, is bullish. He insists that the broadcaster's image has not been tarnished by the row, but believes that the organisation will suffer if it does not jump on to the digital bandwagon. \"I don't think our brand has eroded. But I do think that if we are not universally available, our brand will erode. Our news channel is part of the process of ensuring this doesn't happen.\" Tait says that the new channel is crucial to safeguard ITN's future. For while there will be an appetite for traditional news services for some time to come - and its contracts with ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 are secure for the next few years - the broadcasting landscape is on the verge of significant upheaval. \"No one is obliged to watch news programmes any more. We want to get away from the traditional notion of news services, that viewers get everything the broadcaster thinks they need, rather than what the viewer wants,\" he says. The channel goes on air later this month. Last week, Tait and launch editor Bill Dunlop were refusing to reveal the name of the venture, nor its line-up of presenters, nor its on-screen look - one wonders why they bothered talking about it in the first place. Perhaps they were a little embarrassed: one bright spark came up with the idea of calling it simply ITN, but that idea was dropped a few weeks ago. ITN later relented and named the principal faces of the channel, who will be familiar to terrestrial viewers: John Suchet and Julia Somerville will present in the morning and evening respectively, and Carol Barnes will be on air at weekends, allowing her to continue her day job at Brighton magistrates' court. (Suchet will swap studios later in the morning to slip alongside his colleague Kirsty Young for his regular slot on the ITV Lunchtime News.) Launching a new channel would be pointless without poaching a few names from key rivals, so there's Andrew Harvey from BBC News 24 and Leyla Day Belge from Sky News. Viewers of Sky Digital and customers of the NTL cable operator - which is a partner in the new venture - will see it from day one. Negotiations are also under way with Telewest, and ONDigital viewers will get it in the mornings. The format of the channel will be somewhat different from the competition. While both News 24 and Sky tend to stick to the model of a 30-minute news bulletin at the top of the hour followed by a \"back half-hour\" of business, sport or other documentary, ITN has decided to go for a rolling news service, in 15-minute loops. A key difference is that there will be one, not two on-screen presenters even in peak times. The channel's look is expected to be straightforwardly slick, with no Channel 5-type desk-perching or Jon Snow-style studio wandering. Material will be gathered from ITN's existing reporters and production staff, and the regular agencies, augmented by dedicated 24-hour channel staff. ITN has already set up a \"core\" group which will direct material to ITN's different outlets - principally ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5 and Euronews - and to the new channel. The system should ensure that reporters in the field are not called up by commissioners from competing programmes in the same office - a practice which is the bane of BBC reporters' lives. While some would say it has left it a bit late to get into 24-hour news, ITN believes it is coming to the business at exactly the right time. Not least, says Tait, advances in technology have made it less troublesome financially. \"There is no doubt that the digital technology makes it cost-effective. We have every intention of making it a commercial as well as an editorial success.\" And that doesn't mean doing everything on a shoestring: \"I don't believe the way to commercial success is through cost-cutting. It is through investment in quality journalism.\" Nevertheless, Tait refuses to say how many staff are dedicated to the channel - revealing only that at any one time, about 120 people will be working for it, including those also spending time on other outlets. Nick Pollard, the head of Sky News, believes it is a difficult challenge. Sky News made a small profit before the launch of BBC News 24, now it is understood to have slipped just below the red line once again. \"I think they will find it tough, because we all find it tough. It is a very competitive market. We are all already fighting hard for a small percentage of the audience.\" Nevertheless, says Pollard, it is the right decision for ITN to make. \"I think everybody has to assume that they have to get into different types of media. If you start from that premise, it is not that difficult to see how to advance. I think television news is quite well suited to unpredictable things, anyway.\" Clearly, the terrestrial landscape is changing forever. \"Even the mighty BBC1 and BBC2 may become themed channels, and the idea of 'hammocking' worthy programmes between a couple of popular programmes is out of the window, and rightly so. In general, news is bound to be marginalised on the terrestrial channels.\" Sky, too, is determined to stay ahead of the game. From today, viewers of Sky Digital will be able to take advantage of yet more gimmicks (sorry, interactive services) on Sky News. At the touch of a button, Sky News Active is launched and news junkies can access headlines, weather, business and showbiz news at any given moment. The technology - still in its early stages - is nevertheless impressive: a split screen comes into view with four panels showing the four options. At a flick of the Sky digital handset, viewers can call up whatever service they require, without having to wait for it to come around on the main Sky News service. Any of the four \"play school\" type windows (unfortunately for the analogy, all are square) can be replaced with a live feed, so important press conferences can be played out in full on Sky News Active while the main service continues with other stories. Pollard believes such developments are key for broadcasters who who don't want to be left behind. In a declaration which should be plastered on the walls of every television executive, he says: \"If we don't do it, somebody else will.\" Bring back News at Ten, or else (er, or else what?) Pulling on his biggest pair of Doc Martens, the independent television commission's chairman Sir Robin Biggam declared last month that he was giving ITV one last chance to come up with a plan to corral the country into watching its news. \"The uncertainty cannot be allowed to continue,\" boomed the man who once told an industry audience that his family do jigsaws at Christmas instead of watching TV. On Thursday, Sir Robin - his DMs buffed up for the occasion - \"got tough\" and insisted ITV move its Nightly News programme to an earlier time slot. Or so we were told. The thing was that, despite the headlines the next day, he did no such thing: no formal direction emerged from Foley Street, the ITC's London home. The regulator, having stepped up to the brink last month, got vertigo. To force ITV's hand at this stage would almost certainly - as this newspaper reported last week - have resulted in the network hauling the commission before the high court to explain its actions. So instead of stepping out, it dangled a foot over the edge to test the wind. It \"insisted\" that ITV move the news, but didn't \"direct\" it to do so. In PR terms, it was a neat move, reflected in the following day's headlines; in substance, it was typical of the ITC's timidity, and has prolonged the agony at least until the ITC's next meeting, in a month. All through this sorry saga, the ITC has bottled the key decisions.

      "bodyText": "One of the most racist chapters in the history of 20th century South Africa came to a close at the weekend when a political party was born out of the merger of the Democratic party with the New National party. The former rivals over apartheid agreed on Saturday to form a new party, the Democratic Alliance, headed by the Democratic party leader Tony Leon, a white English speaker, with the New National leader Marthinus van Schalkwyk, a white Afrikaner, as his deputy. The move is designed to strengthen opposition to the governing African National Congress, although the new party is not expected to pose a threat to the political supremacy of the ruling party which won 266 seats in the 400-seat parliament at the last general election. South Africa's last white president FW de Klerk said on Sunday he supported the merger of his former party with the Democratic party to forge a new opposition alliance. The National party enforced apartheid after coming to power in 1948 and then proceeded to dismantle it in the early 1990s, allowing the rise to power of the ANC with Nelson Mandela at its helm. The first problem the merging parties face is finding enough common ground for the Nationals' right wing to co-exist comfortably with more liberal elements in the Democratic party. The Democratics' predecessor, the Progressive party, formed in 1959 to oppose the system of racial segregation that was being put into place by the National party. Differences could emerge on social issues such as capital punishment, abortion and affirmative action. But both parties are pro-market and take a tough line on crime in a country where it is rife. The New National party, which added New to its name to try to shed its racist legacy, saw its support slump in last year's election, with the number of seats in the national assembly falling from 82 seats to 28. The first test for the new party will be in the November local elections. At the last general election, the two parties gained 16% of the vote between them.",

      "body": "<p>Last February, an air of euphoria seeped into the corridors of the Necker Hospital for Sick Children in the Montparnasse district of Paris. Wondrous cures, great courage and the heart-hollowing grief of parents left behind by children who could not be saved, make the Necker and its ilk emotionally charged places at any time, but this was different.</p> <p>What was happening to the 11-month-old baby boy in the airtight bubble in a room in the hospital's immunology and haematology unit was an incredible transformation, and more: it was history. For the first time, doctors had used mankind's knowledge of the genes involved in a fatal disease to cure it. After over eight years of inconclusive experiments, gene therapy's promise to correct nature's flaws was being realised. Now that humans' genetic code has been cracked, more and more of those flaws will come within reach of repair. </p> <p>When the little boy was admitted to hospital, he was facing death within a year from a rare inherited disorder called X-linked SCID, one of a family of diseases that cause children to be born without a working immune system. The slightest infection can be deadly.</p> <p>The boy lay in his bubble, his only direct contact with mother, father and nurse through plastic gloves, for several days while doctors Alain Fischer, Marina Cavazzana-Calvo and Salima Hacein-Bey, took out a few million of his bone marrow cells and coaxed the healthy gene to enter them. Then they put them back - a single, simple infusion of 20 to 30 millilitres of fluid. It took half an hour to buy the boy what they hope will be a lifetime of normal immunity.</p> <p>Doctors knew in 15 days from tests that the new gene was working. But the marvel for the parents was watching the change in their sickly, underweight boy. Before their eyes, he began to thrive. The ugly red blotches on his skin faded away, his diarrhoea disappeared, he put on weight, his breathing became easier.</p> <p>Three months after the infusion, his astonished parents were told they could take him home. There he remains, a normal, healthy two-year-old boy.</p> <p>\"We lived three months of euphoria in the lab,\" said Cavazzana-Calvo. \"Everyone was so happy. For three to six months we talked about nothing else except the results. Nothing else was important.\"</p> <p>Adrian Thrasher, a consultant in child immunology at Great Ormond Street hospital, said: \"This is the first time we can say unequivocally that gene therapy is effective on its own. Patients have not received any other treatment, yet have got better.\"</p> <p>Three other children, one French, one Dutch and one American, have since been treated at the Necker Hospital with similar success. A fifth boy, Shah Rayhman from London, has done less well, because the disease had already caused serious complications, but the Necker is pressing ahead with further trials later this year, and similar gene therapy is to be carried out in London and Maryland.</p> <p>This first gene therapy success, formally announced in April's issue of the journal Science, will have to be further proven over time, and does not translate into working gene therapies for other, more common genetic diseases like cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy or Down's syndrome. But it is a stride forward after last year's pessimism about gene therapy in the wake of the death of Jesse Gelsinger, the 18-year-old gene therapy guinea pig who died in a poorly designed trial in Pennsylvania.</p> <p>\"I think this is the first case where we can say: here are human beings who have received no other treatment than gene therapy,\" said Dr Jennifer Puck, a leading genetics researcher specialising in the immune system at the US National Institute of Health in Maryland. \"When they started, they had no immunity, and now they're exactly as good as any babies their age.</p> <p>\"The immune system is not totally mature until they're two or three or four years of age. Then the question is, is this going to last a lifetime?\"</p> <p>Dr Cavazzana-Calvo said: \"Curing is one thing. Correcting an illness for two or three years is another. We have not had enough follow-up time to claim that it's a definitive treatment: it's a success so far. But the importance of this work is to have made the proof of principle that this strategy can work.</p> <p>\"We stress that our success is a success for this particular disease. But after the problem in the States, this has been a fresh breath of air for gene therapy.\"</p> <p>Seen through the eyes of the genetics researcher, the human body is a humblingly vast world, made up of 75 trillion cells. In this world, each cell is like a city state in its own right. Each has walls bristling with communications equipment. Inside, it has stockpiles of chemical raw materials; its own power plant; factories making products according to the city state's own needs and the needs of its import-export operations; and an army of couriers carrying instructions to the factories.</p> <p>At the centre of each of these city states (with the exception of one specialised kind, the red blood cells) is the library where these couriers find their instructions. This is the genome. The tens of thousands of volumes in this library contain orders for the couriers, such as \"tell the factory to make this much insulin, now\". Sometimes the couriers will bring instructions into the library from another city, telling them to seal or unseal this or that volume.</p> <p>Now imagine that in each of these billions of libraries there is an identical mistake in one book - a missing page, an extra page, a figure out of place. The obedient couriers will do their best to fulfil the bad instructions, and something will go wrong. It may not do the cell much harm. It may make it seriously defective. In the worst case, the whole world goes dark and dies.</p> <p>Looked at this way, it is possible to understand how hard the task facing gene therapy scientists is. First, they see that there is trouble in some of the cities: the walls are the wrong shape, say, making them vulnerable to attack from outside. Then, scientists have to work out which of the volumes in the libraries is causing this by giving out false instructions about wall-building. To make it harder, several volumes, cross-referencing each other, could be involved.</p> <p>Finally, they have to work out how to transport a correct replacement book on an often treacherous journey to the gates of millions of cities, smuggle it inside, and sneak it on to the library shelves in such a way that the couriers will read it and obey.</p> <p>With X-linked SCID, researchers identified the flaw in 1993. It lay on the x-chromosome, which in boys is one of 46 sets of genes in the genome. (Girls have a spare set of x-chromosomes so are not affected by the disease.) The flaw, a tiny genetic mutation, is a tragic broken link in a vital sequence.</p> <p>In every person's bone marrow is a group of cells known as stem cells, which, when they receive the right chemical signals, evolve and multiply to become red and white blood cells. The white blood cells are central to the body's daily fight against infection, identifying and killing alien organisms. In order to turn into white blood cells, the stem cells have to receive a signal from other cells in the body telling them to do so. In babies with X-linked SCID, the faulty gene fails to produce one of the proteins which enable the cells to receive the signals - so the cell does not hear, there are no white blood cells, and no immunity.</p> <p>So how did Cavazzana-Calvo, Hacein-Bey and their eleven collaborators crack it? They took bone marrow from the little boy and isolated the cells most likely to be stem cells. Then they sent in mercenaries, in the form of a virus. Viruses do what the scientists cannot do themselves, break inside a cell with a set of genes and squeeze the genes into the host genome. It is possible to slip a human gene into a harmless virus and have it infect human cells, which can then be returned to the patient. That was what the Necker team did. The cells given the good gene entered the baby's body and produced the missing component.</p> <p>X-linked SCID is rare, afflicting 0.002% of the population. But when it threatens the lives of 100% of your children, as it did with Ann Vincent from Tewkesbury, the rarity is no comfort. For a mother to be told her baby has the disease, the shock is threefold. First, your son could die before his second birthday. Second, you are the carrier. Third, your mind flashes back over family history; the mysterious infant deaths of brothers generations back become mysteries no longer.</p> <p>\"I come from a family which has a history of losing baby boys when they were six months old. They all died of different things, so we never thought they were connected. But when my son became really, really ill, he was diagnosed with X-linked SCID. It was the same hospital where my brother Richard had been treated 30 years ago, and they got out his notes.</p> <p>\"Suddenly, I felt so terrible for my mother. She'd been going through the same thing as me. She had three brothers who died and now we know why. I always thought there was a family curse.\"</p> <p>Mercifully, since 1968, there has been another treatment for SCID patients: a bone marrow transplant. A donor was found for Ann's first son, Owen, and he was saved. Later, she accidentally became pregnant again, with another son, Niall, who also had the defective gene. Doctors were able to save him using his older brother's rejuvenated bone marrow.</p> <p>But marrow transplants have severe limitations. Even patients with compatible donors have to endure months of chemotherapy, with all its ghastly side effects. Patients with non-compatible donors have only a 60% chance of survival, and many of those who do survive have only partially restored immune systems.</p> <p>Craig Smith, from High Wycombe, who died last March aged four, was beaten by the imperfection of bone marrow transplants and the sheer obscurity of the disease. His parents Penny and Peter kept him alive for almost three years - an astonishing figure for an X-linked SCID patient - while a succession of GPs and consultants failed to see through his myriad infections to the root cause.</p> <p>Craig had a transplant at Great Ormond Street. At first, things looked good, but then his body began to reject the donor marrow, his liver failed and he started to slip away. Penny Smith remembers her doctors talking about gene therapy, but had no idea it was so far advanced. </p> <p>Many false hopes have been raised before, and bone marrow transplants will continue to save lives for the foreseeable future, but the signs look good that X-linked SCID, at least, can within a few years be held at bay by better means. Ultimately, children could be treated in the womb. As the human genome reveals its secrets, other inherited diseases, in children and in adults, should follow.</p> <p>Penny Smith is 41. \"If Craig was still here, or I did, by chance, have any more children, I would go for gene therapy,\" she said. \"I really do wish them every success, the children and the doctors.\"</p>",

Inside, it has stockpiles of chemical raw materials; its own power plant; factories making products according to the city state's own needs and the needs of its import-export operations; and an army of couriers carrying instructions to the factories. At the centre of each of these city states (with the exception of one specialised kind, the red blood cells) is the library where these couriers find their instructions. This is the genome. The tens of thousands of volumes in this library contain orders for the couriers, such as \"tell the factory to make this much insulin, now\". Sometimes the couriers will bring instructions into the library from another city, telling them to seal or unseal this or that volume. Now imagine that in each of these billions of libraries there is an identical mistake in one book - a missing page, an extra page, a figure out of place. The obedient couriers will do their best to fulfil the bad instructions, and something will go wrong. It may not do the cell much harm. It may make it seriously defective. In the worst case, the whole world goes dark and dies. Looked at this way, it is possible to understand how hard the task facing gene therapy scientists is. First, they see that there is trouble in some of the cities: the walls are the wrong shape, say, making them vulnerable to attack from outside. Then, scientists have to work out which of the volumes in the libraries is causing this by giving out false instructions about wall-building. To make it harder, several volumes, cross-referencing each other, could be involved. Finally, they have to work out how to transport a correct replacement book on an often treacherous journey to the gates of millions of cities, smuggle it inside, and sneak it on to the library shelves in such a way that the couriers will read it and obey. With X-linked SCID, researchers identified the flaw in 1993. It lay on the x-chromosome, which in boys is one of 46 sets of genes in the genome. (Girls have a spare set of x-chromosomes so are not affected by the disease.) The flaw, a tiny genetic mutation, is a tragic broken link in a vital sequence. In every person's bone marrow is a group of cells known as stem cells, which, when they receive the right chemical signals, evolve and multiply to become red and white blood cells. The white blood cells are central to the body's daily fight against infection, identifying and killing alien organisms. In order to turn into white blood cells, the stem cells have to receive a signal from other cells in the body telling them to do so. In babies with X-linked SCID, the faulty gene fails to produce one of the proteins which enable the cells to receive the signals - so the cell does not hear, there are no white blood cells, and no immunity. So how did Cavazzana-Calvo, Hacein-Bey and their eleven collaborators crack it? They took bone marrow from the little boy and isolated the cells most likely to be stem cells. Then they sent in mercenaries, in the form of a virus. Viruses do what the scientists cannot do themselves, break inside a cell with a set of genes and squeeze the genes into the host genome. It is possible to slip a human gene into a harmless virus and have it infect human cells, which can then be returned to the patient. That was what the Necker team did. The cells given the good gene entered the baby's body and produced the missing component. X-linked SCID is rare, afflicting 0.002% of the population. But when it threatens the lives of 100% of your children, as it did with Ann Vincent from Tewkesbury, the rarity is no comfort. For a mother to be told her baby has the disease, the shock is threefold. First, your son could die before his second birthday. Second, you are the carrier. Third, your mind flashes back over family history; the mysterious infant deaths of brothers generations back become mysteries no longer. \"I come from a family which has a history of losing baby boys when they were six months old. They all died of different things, so we never thought they were connected. But when my son became really, really ill, he was diagnosed with X-linked SCID. It was the same hospital where my brother Richard had been treated 30 years ago, and they got out his notes. \"Suddenly, I felt so terrible for my mother. She'd been going through the same thing as me. She had three brothers who died and now we know why. I always thought there was a family curse.\" Mercifully, since 1968, there has been another treatment for SCID patients: a bone marrow transplant. A donor was found for Ann's first son, Owen, and he was saved. Later, she accidentally became pregnant again, with another son, Niall, who also had the defective gene. Doctors were able to save him using his older brother's rejuvenated bone marrow. But marrow transplants have severe limitations. Even patients with compatible donors have to endure months of chemotherapy, with all its ghastly side effects. Patients with non-compatible donors have only a 60% chance of survival, and many of those who do survive have only partially restored immune systems. Craig Smith, from High Wycombe, who died last March aged four, was beaten by the imperfection of bone marrow transplants and the sheer obscurity of the disease. His parents Penny and Peter kept him alive for almost three years - an astonishing figure for an X-linked SCID patient - while a succession of GPs and consultants failed to see through his myriad infections to the root cause. Craig had a transplant at Great Ormond Street. At first, things looked good, but then his body began to reject the donor marrow, his liver failed and he started to slip away. Penny Smith remembers her doctors talking about gene therapy, but had no idea it was so far advanced. Many false hopes have been raised before, and bone marrow transplants will continue to save lives for the foreseeable future, but the signs look good that X-linked SCID, at least, can within a few years be held at bay by better means. Ultimately, children could be treated in the womb. As the human genome reveals its secrets, other inherited diseases, in children and in adults, should follow. Penny Smith is 41. \"If Craig was still here, or I did, by chance, have any more children, I would go for gene therapy,\" she said. \"I really do wish them every success, the children and the doctors.\"",

Geneticists have long understood that genetics is a far more subtle business than counting genetic beads along chromosome strings, and then isolating those particular beads that have some association with a trait or disease. Genes do not have a clear one-to-one correspondence with some external effect. There is no gene for blue eyes, or flat feet. No matter what you read in the papers, there is no gene for violence, homosexuality or maternal instinct. Genes do not work alone - they work in large, cooperative networks. Many, if not most genes contain instructions for proteins whose task is to interact with the DNA of other genes - to act as regulators.</p> <p>This much has been suspected since the birth of genetics, perhaps even earlier. The problem is that we have had no way to get to grips with the issue in any larger, rounded way. Until genomics, we were limited by technology to studying genes laboriously, one at a time, making it impossible to grasp the big picture.

Now scientists are able to look at whole genomes and map the genes within them, they see that genes do get clustered and organised according to their function, and the proximity of the genes with which they must interact. This seems obvious in hindsight: after all, what is an organism but the product of a single, gigantic operon, the genome itself?</p> <p>As scientists get to know more about genomes, the bridegroom's bedsheet will literally fall away. They will see how genes interact to produce not just metabolic pathways, but whole organisms. Increasingly, the growth and development of organisms will be described in terms of interactions of genes in complex networks. Complexity theorists have long understood that the behaviour of such networks cannot be predicted from the behaviour of any of its isolated units. This is, at root, why there is no single gene for any specified trait.

This view relies on a certain independence of genes, yet evolutionary biologists have long had trouble understanding how, if this view were universally true, genes could cooperate to create organisms. The selfish genes theory would solve this by suggesting that cooperation reaps more long-term dividends than selfishness. In other words, selfish genes act by a form of enlightened self-interest. The advent of genomics could expose this view as needlessly complicated. Genes are cooperative because they are simply cooperative: selfishness need not come into the equation. To say that cooperative behaviour is a way of furthering the selfishness of genes more effectively, is like the introduction of planetary \"epicycles\" to shore up the Ptolemaic earth-centred universe, when the Copernican sun-centred model is much simpler.

This will forge a long-desired link in biology, that of understanding how phylogeny (the relatedness of organisms) is connected with changes in their ontogeny (their individual development from egg, to embryo, to adult). In the late 19th century, Darwin's German proselyte Ernst Haeckel promoted the view that \"ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny\". This phrase has been endlessly argued over since then, without much hope of resolution. Genomic information will help us find the answers (because, yes, there will be more than one).

The biggest effects of genomics on everyday life, as the next century wears on, will be practical ones. Genomics will allow us to alter entire organisms out of all recognition, to suit our needs and tastes.

Critics said it it would cost insane sums of money, take decades to complete and deliver only a stream of data encoded in an alphabet of four letters, nine-tenths of which would have no meaning at all. </p> <p>When scientists proposed the idea in the 1980s, it took hours of painstaking effort using exquisitely tricky chemistry, to \"read\" even a few thousand bits of DNA. The cost was put at $5 to $10 for each one of the four \"letters\" - sometimes called nucleotides, sometimes base pairs - in the 3 billion-letter human alphabet. When, in the teeth of grumbling from fellow biologists, foot-dragging by politicians in Britain and America and explicit public concern in Germany, the project gathered momentum, the international cost was set at $3bn in total - $1 for each base pair. Right now the cost has fallen to 10 or 20 cents.</p> <p>The first \"rough draft\" is complete, thanks to astonishing advances in robotics and computing, and subtle tricks with electrochemistry.</p> <p>The challenge was to decipher the entire DNA of one representative human, selected from a group of anonymous donors. But the DNA of one human is an invisible double-stranded molecule arbitrarily chopped up by nature into 46 chromosomes - 23 inherited from the mother, 23 from the father - and folded into impenetrable tangles. It was then, and still is impossible to read in that form: impossible even to see, let alone manipulate. </p> <p>So researchers took lengths of human DNA and inserted them into bacteria, and then grew the bacteria, much in the way dairymen \"grow\" yoghurt, allowing each bacterial specimen to \"clone\" the same bit of DNA indefinitely, so that it could be preserved in dishes in a human DNA \"library\".</p> <p>But that was the equivalent of simply tearing random paragraphs out of a book, hoping to read them later.</p> <p>So the first step was to try to make a \"map\" of the human genome: to establish recognisable genes, or telltale lengths of DNA, at points along all the chromosomes so that those given the challenge of \"reading\" the sequence would start with a rough idea of where, in a particular chapter, their paragraph might fall. That effort continued throughout the 90s, as individual groups in the worldwide community of biologists began to identify then locate genes associated with diseases such as muscular dystrophy and cystic fibrosis.</p> <p>By this time, too, teams within the Human Genome Project, in industry, in the medical charities and in government research laboratories were getting experience with the genetic codes of complex creatures such as yeast, a little member of the mustard family called Arabidopsis, the nematode worm or the fruit fly. </p> <p>Since DNA is the machinery of evolution, the genes of all creatures would show similarities, and make recognition easier. </p> <p>All the researchers used a technique developed by Frederick Sanger, the Cambridge scientist who deciphered the protein structure of insulin, won a Nobel Prize for it, and then went back to his laboratory to decipher the code of DNA. A feat which earned him another Nobel prize. </p> <p>The Sanger method, then done by hand (but now by specially commissioned robots) was simple. You shredded the DNA sample into a large number of lengths ending up with very short bits, medium lengths and long bits. If you did it often enough, you would end up with bits of every possible length. Then you would tag the end of each with a fluorescent dye, dribble them into a tiny, jelly-filled capillary tube the thickness of a human hair, using electricity to help them settle. The shortest would settle first, then the next shortest and so on until the fragments were in order. </p> <p>When you had enough fragments, all overlapping each other, you could get a computer to match them, rather like reassembling the Bible from fragments that said \"Saul\" or \"Psalm\" or \"Solomon\".</p> <p>But the process also has to be fast. To read a base-pair sequence of a human being out loud - at, say, five letters a second - it would take 20 sleepless years. The original Sanger method could deliver thousands of letters a day, but the project demanded millions. </p> <p>So what began as a meticulous matter of test tubes and syringes and white-coated laboratory staff became rooms full of robots: St Louis, Missouri; Cambridge, England; Cambridge, Massachusetts or Rockville, Maryland. Biology, invented by gentlemen-amateurs became big science, demanding engineering skills and computing power far greater than needed for the Apollo programme. Although the researchers have blown a whistle, posted their latest results and declared a milestone passed, it isn't complete. </p> <p>\"There is roughly 10%we haven't sequenced,\" says Don Powell, a molecular biologist at the Sanger Centre in Cambridge. \"The attitude in the Human Genome Project is that we are putting this data out, it is only going to be done once and it absolutely has to be done properly. Everybody is agreed you need to do everything tenfold in order to get yourself down to 99.99% accuracy. We will achieve better than that. Because the genome is only going to be sequenced once to this level of completion - no other organisation is going to do all this finishing and all the work to plug all the holes we can - it has to be done properly.\"</p>",

When scientists proposed the idea in the 1980s, it took hours of painstaking effort using exquisitely tricky chemistry, to \"read\" even a few thousand bits of DNA. The cost was put at $5 to $10 for each one of the four \"letters\" - sometimes called nucleotides, sometimes base pairs - in the 3 billion-letter human alphabet. When, in the teeth of grumbling from fellow biologists, foot-dragging by politicians in Britain and America and explicit public concern in Germany, the project gathered momentum, the international cost was set at $3bn in total - $1 for each base pair. Right now the cost has fallen to 10 or 20 cents. The first \"rough draft\" is complete, thanks to astonishing advances in robotics and computing, and subtle tricks with electrochemistry. The challenge was to decipher the entire DNA of one representative human, selected from a group of anonymous donors. But the DNA of one human is an invisible double-stranded molecule arbitrarily chopped up by nature into 46 chromosomes - 23 inherited from the mother, 23 from the father - and folded into impenetrable tangles. It was then, and still is impossible to read in that form: impossible even to see, let alone manipulate. So researchers took lengths of human DNA and inserted them into bacteria, and then grew the bacteria, much in the way dairymen \"grow\" yoghurt, allowing each bacterial specimen to \"clone\" the same bit of DNA indefinitely, so that it could be preserved in dishes in a human DNA \"library\". But that was the equivalent of simply tearing random paragraphs out of a book, hoping to read them later. So the first step was to try to make a \"map\" of the human genome: to establish recognisable genes, or telltale lengths of DNA, at points along all the chromosomes so that those given the challenge of \"reading\" the sequence would start with a rough idea of where, in a particular chapter, their paragraph might fall. That effort continued throughout the 90s, as individual groups in the worldwide community of biologists began to identify then locate genes associated with diseases such as muscular dystrophy and cystic fibrosis. By this time, too, teams within the Human Genome Project, in industry, in the medical charities and in government research laboratories were getting experience with the genetic codes of complex creatures such as yeast, a little member of the mustard family called Arabidopsis, the nematode worm or the fruit fly. Since DNA is the machinery of evolution, the genes of all creatures would show similarities, and make recognition easier. All the researchers used a technique developed by Frederick Sanger, the Cambridge scientist who deciphered the protein structure of insulin, won a Nobel Prize for it, and then went back to his laboratory to decipher the code of DNA. A feat which earned him another Nobel prize. The Sanger method, then done by hand (but now by specially commissioned robots) was simple. You shredded the DNA sample into a large number of lengths ending up with very short bits, medium lengths and long bits. If you did it often enough, you would end up with bits of every possible length. Then you would tag the end of each with a fluorescent dye, dribble them into a tiny, jelly-filled capillary tube the thickness of a human hair, using electricity to help them settle. The shortest would settle first, then the next shortest and so on until the fragments were in order. When you had enough fragments, all overlapping each other, you could get a computer to match them, rather like reassembling the Bible from fragments that said \"Saul\" or \"Psalm\" or \"Solomon\". But the process also has to be fast. To read a base-pair sequence of a human being out loud - at, say, five letters a second - it would take 20 sleepless years. The original Sanger method could deliver thousands of letters a day, but the project demanded millions. So what began as a meticulous matter of test tubes and syringes and white-coated laboratory staff became rooms full of robots: St Louis, Missouri; Cambridge, England; Cambridge, Massachusetts or Rockville, Maryland. Biology, invented by gentlemen-amateurs became big science, demanding engineering skills and computing power far greater than needed for the Apollo programme. Although the researchers have blown a whistle, posted their latest results and declared a milestone passed, it isn't complete. \"There is roughly 10%we haven't sequenced,\" says Don Powell, a molecular biologist at the Sanger Centre in Cambridge. \"The attitude in the Human Genome Project is that we are putting this data out, it is only going to be done once and it absolutely has to be done properly. Everybody is agreed you need to do everything tenfold in order to get yourself down to 99.99% accuracy. We will achieve better than that. Because the genome is only going to be sequenced once to this level of completion - no other organisation is going to do all this finishing and all the work to plug all the holes we can - it has to be done properly.\"",

      "body": "<p>When Robert Raine was born one hundred years ago, Queen Victoria was still Empress of India, 82 acres of land in Kensington was about to go under the hammer for half a million pounds and the government had just raised the minimum age of coalminers to 13.</p> <p>The Essex centenarian is living witness to all the wonder, grief and fads of the last century. He is still going strong. Apart from some arthritis in his knees, he suffers from no significant illnesses. He lives by himself, in his own house, with the occasional assistance of the social services and Age Concern. He goes for a walk every afternoon.</p> <p>And yet, of course, he is old. His skin has lost its youthful elasticity. His limbs respond more slowly to his will. His eyesight and hearing are less acute, and although his memory for the immense canvas of the past is still magnificent, his short-term memory is not so sharp. Today, for the first time, scientists are daring to look at that most natural and seemingly unstoppable of human processes, ageing, and ask some startling questions. Should ageing itself be seen as a disease? If so, why does everyone get it? And can it be stopped?</p> <p>Of all the strange new horizons made visible by the decoding of the human genome, none is more hazy and more tantalising than this one. For our genes do not only contain the secrets of life, they also hold the secrets of death. And some researchers are looking to a future where knowledge and manipulation of our genes places the 100th year at the halfway mark in an active life spanning 200 years - or more.</p> <p>\"If you walk into the doctor's surgery, and you're fine, and you're 80, you're given a pat on the back and told it's great,\" says Gordon Lithgow, a lecturer and researcher into ageing at the University of Manchester. \"If you're 20 and illness-free but have the body of an 80-year-old man, you'd be hospitalised immediately. There is something going on which we've never called a disease. I think perceptions will change.\"</p> <p>Even before the prospect of knowing the function of all our genes came into view, biologists pondered on death. What, they wondered, was the point? Why should evolution have designed a creosote bush in the desert which would live for 11,000 years, a human being who was lucky to reach 70 and a mouse which burned out in a couple of years, when in theory cells should be able to reproduce and repair themselves indefinitely?</p> <p>Some genetics researchers, particularly in the US, believe in the notion of programmed death - that there is a clock ticking away in our body which begins to kill us when we reach a certain age, and that the clock can be wound back.</p> <p>The more popular theory comes from evolutionary biologists, and seems to be borne out by research. It reminds us that human beings are the products of evolution which crafted us to live successfully in the wild, not in the sheltered, well-fed, medicine-rich environment of the modern developed world. In the wild, our ancestors never had a chance to grow old: predators, accidents and disease took them in their prime. There was no point in a creature evolving which had the biochemistry necessary to live for hundreds of years if it was going to be swiftly torn apart by a sabre-toothed tiger before its 30th birthday.</p> <p>\"The evolutionary biologists have come up with a powerful idea,\" says Lithgow, \"that says it wasn't worth building for the long term. In the wild, animals don't age. Something gets them first. Natural selection doesn't care what happens to us. We are disposable once we reproduce. We are not programmed to die.\" </p> <p>Ageing research is a young field, with no more than a couple of dozen labs around the world regularly producing papers. But some of the results already achieved have been remarkable. By tinkering with the genes of a favourite lab animal, the nematode worm, scientists have been able to treble its lifespan.</p> <p>Last year, by modifying the genes of mice, an Italian team was able to extend their lifespan by 30%. The mouse genome is very similar to that of humans.</p> <p>Some of the causes and obstacles to ageing have been on the suspect list for a long time. Free radicals, molecules produced in cells as a by-product of the body's use of oxygen, go careering through our metabolism, jamming awkward atoms in vital molecular mechanisms and causing wear and tear. High levels of stress seem to accelerate ageing, as do toxins like alcohol and tobacco. On the other side, any animal which has its calorie intake sharply reduced seems to become healthier and live longer.</p> <p>With increased knowledge of how our genes work, scientists are poised to look into what governs these processes.</p> <p>\"The impact of the genome sequence is going to be incredible,\" said Lithgow. \"We can't complete our understanding of ageing without the genome. It may be another 50 years before it's turned into something useful, but you start by sequencing the DNA.\"</p> <p>Targeting the genes involved in ageing is a hazardous business. The line between rejuvenating cells and turning them into tumours is a delicate one. The US firm Geron Corporation, one of the few companies set up to exploit ageing research for profit, has made persuasive claims for the properties of an enzyme called telomerase, which it says confers \"immortality\" or \"mortality\" upon cells, depending on whether it is present or not.</p> <p>Yet Geron's commercial activity is focused more on the dangers of telomerase - its role in cancer - than on its potential use to defeat ageing.</p> <p>The dual nature of telomerase is reflected in the broader challenge facing scientists as they struggle with no less a task than engineering evolution. It took millions of years for natural selection to produce our wild ancestors: are we prepared to wait millions of years for natural selection to modify the naked hunter in us to best use the world of medicines, soft furnishings and burger bars?</p> <p>We think of early-onset Alzheimer's disease, which strikes people in their 40s or 50s, as the result of inherited genetic flaws. In fact, it may be a consequence of an original, ancient gene which served a useful purpose before its owner died in his or her 30s.

      "bodyText": "When Robert Raine was born one hundred years ago, Queen Victoria was still Empress of India, 82 acres of land in Kensington was about to go under the hammer for half a million pounds and the government had just raised the minimum age of coalminers to 13. The Essex centenarian is living witness to all the wonder, grief and fads of the last century. He is still going strong. Apart from some arthritis in his knees, he suffers from no significant illnesses. He lives by himself, in his own house, with the occasional assistance of the social services and Age Concern. He goes for a walk every afternoon. And yet, of course, he is old. His skin has lost its youthful elasticity. His limbs respond more slowly to his will. His eyesight and hearing are less acute, and although his memory for the immense canvas of the past is still magnificent, his short-term memory is not so sharp. Today, for the first time, scientists are daring to look at that most natural and seemingly unstoppable of human processes, ageing, and ask some startling questions. Should ageing itself be seen as a disease? If so, why does everyone get it? And can it be stopped? Of all the strange new horizons made visible by the decoding of the human genome, none is more hazy and more tantalising than this one. For our genes do not only contain the secrets of life, they also hold the secrets of death. And some researchers are looking to a future where knowledge and manipulation of our genes places the 100th year at the halfway mark in an active life spanning 200 years - or more. \"If you walk into the doctor's surgery, and you're fine, and you're 80, you're given a pat on the back and told it's great,\" says Gordon Lithgow, a lecturer and researcher into ageing at the University of Manchester. \"If you're 20 and illness-free but have the body of an 80-year-old man, you'd be hospitalised immediately. There is something going on which we've never called a disease. I think perceptions will change.\" Even before the prospect of knowing the function of all our genes came into view, biologists pondered on death. What, they wondered, was the point? Why should evolution have designed a creosote bush in the desert which would live for 11,000 years, a human being who was lucky to reach 70 and a mouse which burned out in a couple of years, when in theory cells should be able to reproduce and repair themselves indefinitely? Some genetics researchers, particularly in the US, believe in the notion of programmed death - that there is a clock ticking away in our body which begins to kill us when we reach a certain age, and that the clock can be wound back. The more popular theory comes from evolutionary biologists, and seems to be borne out by research. It reminds us that human beings are the products of evolution which crafted us to live successfully in the wild, not in the sheltered, well-fed, medicine-rich environment of the modern developed world. In the wild, our ancestors never had a chance to grow old: predators, accidents and disease took them in their prime. There was no point in a creature evolving which had the biochemistry necessary to live for hundreds of years if it was going to be swiftly torn apart by a sabre-toothed tiger before its 30th birthday. \"The evolutionary biologists have come up with a powerful idea,\" says Lithgow, \"that says it wasn't worth building for the long term. In the wild, animals don't age. Something gets them first. Natural selection doesn't care what happens to us. We are disposable once we reproduce. We are not programmed to die.\" Ageing research is a young field, with no more than a couple of dozen labs around the world regularly producing papers. But some of the results already achieved have been remarkable. By tinkering with the genes of a favourite lab animal, the nematode worm, scientists have been able to treble its lifespan. Last year, by modifying the genes of mice, an Italian team was able to extend their lifespan by 30%. The mouse genome is very similar to that of humans. Some of the causes and obstacles to ageing have been on the suspect list for a long time. Free radicals, molecules produced in cells as a by-product of the body's use of oxygen, go careering through our metabolism, jamming awkward atoms in vital molecular mechanisms and causing wear and tear. High levels of stress seem to accelerate ageing, as do toxins like alcohol and tobacco. On the other side, any animal which has its calorie intake sharply reduced seems to become healthier and live longer. With increased knowledge of how our genes work, scientists are poised to look into what governs these processes. \"The impact of the genome sequence is going to be incredible,\" said Lithgow. \"We can't complete our understanding of ageing without the genome. It may be another 50 years before it's turned into something useful, but you start by sequencing the DNA.\" Targeting the genes involved in ageing is a hazardous business. The line between rejuvenating cells and turning them into tumours is a delicate one. The US firm Geron Corporation, one of the few companies set up to exploit ageing research for profit, has made persuasive claims for the properties of an enzyme called telomerase, which it says confers \"immortality\" or \"mortality\" upon cells, depending on whether it is present or not. Yet Geron's commercial activity is focused more on the dangers of telomerase - its role in cancer - than on its potential use to defeat ageing. The dual nature of telomerase is reflected in the broader challenge facing scientists as they struggle with no less a task than engineering evolution. It took millions of years for natural selection to produce our wild ancestors: are we prepared to wait millions of years for natural selection to modify the naked hunter in us to best use the world of medicines, soft furnishings and burger bars? We think of early-onset Alzheimer's disease, which strikes people in their 40s or 50s, as the result of inherited genetic flaws. In fact, it may be a consequence of an original, ancient gene which served a useful purpose before its owner died in his or her 30s. The \"normal\" gene of people who don't get the disease may, in fact, be a more recent mutation. \"You could be taking something out that in evolutionary history has been very useful. It's almost like a genetic appendix. Now it's no longer useful to us and is causing us harm,\" says Lithgow. \"We don't want to tamper with youth, growth or reproduction. But the genes doing that, making sure we reproduce and grow properly, have side effects in late life. The better we can deal with the side effects, the better we can deal with ageing.\" Ageing research in mice and worms has the advantage that if the animal lives longer, the scientists know relatively soon. In humans, researchers could grow old and die themselves before they know whether their experimental treatments have really worked. According to Lithgow, society has no choice. For economic reasons, it must tackle the diseases of old age, not to extend lifespan but to extend \"healthspan\", the span of a person's active, healthy life. Yet lifespan will inevitably end up being lengthened too. \"We're not in the business of changing lifespan. That's not why we are funded,\" he says. \"What we are trying to do is understand ageing, which causes a hell of a lot of misery through things like Alzheimer's and arthritis. We can't afford it as a society because the number of people who are going to reach a great age, and the demand for long-term care of the elderly, is going up dramatically. That's what we've created with 20th-century medicine - a population of aged individuals who reach the point where they get these diseases. \"If we end up understanding ageing, we can design drugs which interfere with its effects. We would be interfering with the ageing process.\" In other words, changing lifespan. It may not be the aim, but it seems likely to be the achievement. One of the most low-tech approaches may ultimately be the most rewarding: studying the longest-lived families, working out how their lifestyles have worked with their genetic inheritances to keep them healthy so long - the Raine family, for example. \"The whole family eats everything in moderation,\" says Robert Raine's 70-year-old son, also called Robert, a former Ford worker and keen golfer. \"We are not big drinkers, we are not smokers and we've always eaten normal, healthy food, rather than lots of chips and fatty things.

Others, like cancer and heart disease, are thought to be the result of the complex interaction of many genes with environmental factors. The importance of deciphering the human genome is that it will help researchers understand how genes work with each other, rather than in isolation. The success of existing gene therapy research varies from disease to disease, but scores of labs around the world are involved, with some successes among the disappointments.</p> <p><strong> Haemophilia </strong> </p> <p>One of the most promising areas is haemophilia, an inherited disease afflicting males which forces about 10,000 people in Britain to take regular injections of a protein called Factor IX. The protein is essential to make blood clot; without it, sufferers can spontaneously bleed inside, which can lead to permanent disability. The problem is caused by a fault in the gene which should produce Factor IX.</p> <p> Recently a team of US researchers announced promising results in tests. Six human patients were enrolled in a trial after haemophiliac dogs given the engineered virus were cured of the condition. The first three humans were given doses too low to affect the dogs - yet, unexpectedly, the implanted genes began producing enough of the missing protein to allow them to cut back on their injections.</p> <p><strong> Cancer </strong> </p> <p>Clinical trials are under way or about to start - some in the UK - of three promising gene therapies. Phase III trials, the last step before a treatment is authorised for general clinical use, are imminent for an anti-cancer therapy which focuses on a gene called p53. This is known as a \"tumour suppressing gene\", one built into our bodies to halt the runaway growth of cells which marks the beginning of cancer.</p> <p>In many tumour cells, the p53 gene is missing or damaged. Scientists have devised a way to engineer a virus which will only thrive in p53-deficient cells. It can be injected into a patient, and will only enter and damage the harmful cancer cells, leaving healthy cells alone.</p> <p> Other trials focus on the set of so-called \"oncogenes\". In healthy people, they promote normal cell growth and then get switched off. In some cancers, the oncogenes get switched on when they should be dormant. Scientists hope to zoom in on the gene which turns the \"on\" switch and fuse it to another gene called a suicide gene, which activates an anti-tumour drug, killing the cancer cells. </p> <p> A third, more radical approach is to use an engineered gene as a vaccine. In tumours, mutant genes emerge so unfamiliar to the body that its immune system would attack them if only it knew they were there. Researchers hope to identify the mutations, replicate them in the lab and inject them into patients to alert the immune system, which would then attack the cancer as \"foreign\".</p> <p><strong> Cystic fibrosis </strong> </p> <p>Cystic fibrosis is the most common life-shortening illness in Britain linked to a single gene. There are 6,000 sufferers in the UK. Conventional treatment advances have extended their average life expectancy from five to 31, but all-out efforts here and in the US are under way to find an effective gene therapy. The problem gene's worst effect is to reduce the amount of water in the lining of the lungs, leading to a build up of infection-prone mucus. Researchers are trying, with some success, to get \"good\" genes through the mucus barrier.</p> <p> In the US, they are using a virus to get the \"good\" gene to where it is needed. In Britain, scientists are focusing on another delivery system, a fine vapour of synthetic fat droplets. </p> <p>Early results from spraying the gene-enhanced fat into the nose, and now the lungs, have been good, but the effects last only for a short time. The Cystic Fibrosis Trust cautions that the technique is \"gene transfer\" rather than gene therapy. The breakthrough has yet to be made.</p>",

Others, like cancer and heart disease, are thought to be the result of the complex interaction of many genes with environmental factors. The importance of deciphering the human genome is that it will help researchers understand how genes work with each other, rather than in isolation. The success of existing gene therapy research varies from disease to disease, but scores of labs around the world are involved, with some successes among the disappointments. Haemophilia One of the most promising areas is haemophilia, an inherited disease afflicting males which forces about 10,000 people in Britain to take regular injections of a protein called Factor IX. The protein is essential to make blood clot; without it, sufferers can spontaneously bleed inside, which can lead to permanent disability. The problem is caused by a fault in the gene which should produce Factor IX. Recently a team of US researchers announced promising results in tests. Six human patients were enrolled in a trial after haemophiliac dogs given the engineered virus were cured of the condition. The first three humans were given doses too low to affect the dogs - yet, unexpectedly, the implanted genes began producing enough of the missing protein to allow them to cut back on their injections. Cancer Clinical trials are under way or about to start - some in the UK - of three promising gene therapies. Phase III trials, the last step before a treatment is authorised for general clinical use, are imminent for an anti-cancer therapy which focuses on a gene called p53. This is known as a \"tumour suppressing gene\", one built into our bodies to halt the runaway growth of cells which marks the beginning of cancer. In many tumour cells, the p53 gene is missing or damaged. Scientists have devised a way to engineer a virus which will only thrive in p53-deficient cells. It can be injected into a patient, and will only enter and damage the harmful cancer cells, leaving healthy cells alone. Other trials focus on the set of so-called \"oncogenes\". In healthy people, they promote normal cell growth and then get switched off. In some cancers, the oncogenes get switched on when they should be dormant. Scientists hope to zoom in on the gene which turns the \"on\" switch and fuse it to another gene called a suicide gene, which activates an anti-tumour drug, killing the cancer cells. A third, more radical approach is to use an engineered gene as a vaccine. In tumours, mutant genes emerge so unfamiliar to the body that its immune system would attack them if only it knew they were there. Researchers hope to identify the mutations, replicate them in the lab and inject them into patients to alert the immune system, which would then attack the cancer as \"foreign\". Cystic fibrosis Cystic fibrosis is the most common life-shortening illness in Britain linked to a single gene. There are 6,000 sufferers in the UK. Conventional treatment advances have extended their average life expectancy from five to 31, but all-out efforts here and in the US are under way to find an effective gene therapy. The problem gene's worst effect is to reduce the amount of water in the lining of the lungs, leading to a build up of infection-prone mucus. Researchers are trying, with some success, to get \"good\" genes through the mucus barrier. In the US, they are using a virus to get the \"good\" gene to where it is needed. In Britain, scientists are focusing on another delivery system, a fine vapour of synthetic fat droplets. Early results from spraying the gene-enhanced fat into the nose, and now the lungs, have been good, but the effects last only for a short time. The Cystic Fibrosis Trust cautions that the technique is \"gene transfer\" rather than gene therapy. The breakthrough has yet to be made.",

      "body": "<p>One way to classify people is by the tumbler test: pessimists say it is half empty, optimists half full. In most of the great debates about human nature people place themselves somewhere on the continuum between these two poles. </p> <p>There is an obvious application of the tumbler test to political theory, with people like Hobbes in the pessimist camp. Because of his low estimate of human nature, he called for strong princes to control the brutal excesses of society. John Stuart Mill, on the other hand, believed that human nature was rational and capable of altruism, so he argued for liberty and democracy. Science is the dominant narrative of our day, so it is fascinating to watch this ancient debate conduct itself in a new language. Pessimists mistrust science, optimists celebrate the enormous contribution it has made to human progress, but many people are just not sure what to make of it. </p> <p>Reaching a considered judgment on the complex issues that science presents is particularly difficult in Britain at the moment, because of the approach of certain newspapers. The science correspondents in the better papers play an important part in educating the public about science and its implications, but some of the other sheets present the subject as a shoot-out between ordinary decency and overweening arrogance. This may sell papers, but it hardly does justice to the importance of the subject.</p> <p>There are real anxieties, of course. The biotech revolution we are now entering will make the industrial revolution look like a minor blip on the chart of human history. Change always induces anxiety, particularly among natural pessimists, of whom Britain always seems to have more than its fair share, so it's not surprising that recent advances in genetics have provoked alarm in certain quarters. </p> <p>The paradox is that this country has so far managed to pilot a steady course through the scientific revolutions of our era. The paradigm is the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act of 1990. Like any human construct, it is far from perfect, but it does provide us with a model approach to the negotiation of current perplexities. Depending on which side of the pitch you stood, the 1990 Act was a masterly example of either moderate pessimism or moderate optimism, which steered a middle way through the field of reproductive science, between unfettered experimentation and the outlawing of procedures that were novel and controversial at the time. After a certain amount of ritual grandstanding on both sides of the debate, this is the approach we will almost certainly adopt to the new advances in human genetics. But we ought to keep our minds open to some of the sensitive issues that will confront us.</p> <p>One of the difficulties is that the subject is inescapably linked to memories of the pseudo-science of eugenics, with its fascist echoes. The word eugenics is probably beyond rehabilitation, but behind it lies a morally complex issue. Theoretically, it will soon be possible to perform gene therapy to cure or prevent inheritable genetic disease. These therapies in themselves raise interesting ethical problems to which I'll return, but the issue I want to look at briefly now is their likely impact upon existing people with disabilities. </p> <p>It is not too difficult to see why the disabled community might come to interpret these procedures as an attack upon their own value as human beings. We might argue that to try to mend a particular defect is far from saying that those who possess it are less human than the rest of us. </p> <p>Even more complex will be the ethics of the reverse possibility, whereby a disabled couple, such as a profoundly deaf one, might invoke the process in order to design the birth of a disabled child who can be fully at home in its parent's culture. Is there any way in which a truly multicultural society could learn to live with intentionally produced disability? If, as the disabled community claims, disability is socially constructed, might it not be possible to deconstruct it in this way and thereby create genuinely plural communities? We are going to have to breathe deeply and keep our wits about us as we negotiate some of these possibilities.</p> <p>When gene therapy is perfected, it will come in two possible forms, each with its own ethical difficulties. It could be performed using somatic cells, which make up most of the cells in the body, or germ cells from sperm or eggs. Somatic cell gene therapy would only affect the individual who was treated, whereas germ cell therapy would pass the altered genes on to the next generation. In 1989 the government set up a committee to consider the ethics of gene therapy. Its report in 1992 concluded that \"somatic cell gene therapy will be a new kind of treatment, but it does not represent a major departure from established medical practice; nor does it pose new ethical challenges.\"</p> <p>Where it is likely to become controversial, however, is when it is applied to procedures for the enhancement of physical characteristics, such as height or appearance. Though it will doubtless provoke debate, it would be hard to argue that using somatic cell gene therapy for these purposes would be more ethically problematic than getting a nose job or a breast enhancement using existing procedures. Nevertheless, we can expect the tabloids to have a field day with this therapy when it comes on-stream.</p> <p>Germ cell gene therapy, if it is ever made safe, will raise a much more difficult issue. Would it be unethical to apply a technique that would affect an individual prior to conception? The philosopher John Harris argues that, if the technique is proved to be safe and efficacious, it would be unethical not to apply it, because parents have an obligation to avoid harm to their unborn children.</p> <p>However, the real issue here is the moral status of the human embryo.

      "bodyText": "One way to classify people is by the tumbler test: pessimists say it is half empty, optimists half full. In most of the great debates about human nature people place themselves somewhere on the continuum between these two poles. There is an obvious application of the tumbler test to political theory, with people like Hobbes in the pessimist camp. Because of his low estimate of human nature, he called for strong princes to control the brutal excesses of society. John Stuart Mill, on the other hand, believed that human nature was rational and capable of altruism, so he argued for liberty and democracy. Science is the dominant narrative of our day, so it is fascinating to watch this ancient debate conduct itself in a new language. Pessimists mistrust science, optimists celebrate the enormous contribution it has made to human progress, but many people are just not sure what to make of it. Reaching a considered judgment on the complex issues that science presents is particularly difficult in Britain at the moment, because of the approach of certain newspapers. The science correspondents in the better papers play an important part in educating the public about science and its implications, but some of the other sheets present the subject as a shoot-out between ordinary decency and overweening arrogance. This may sell papers, but it hardly does justice to the importance of the subject. There are real anxieties, of course. The biotech revolution we are now entering will make the industrial revolution look like a minor blip on the chart of human history. Change always induces anxiety, particularly among natural pessimists, of whom Britain always seems to have more than its fair share, so it's not surprising that recent advances in genetics have provoked alarm in certain quarters. The paradox is that this country has so far managed to pilot a steady course through the scientific revolutions of our era. The paradigm is the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act of 1990. Like any human construct, it is far from perfect, but it does provide us with a model approach to the negotiation of current perplexities. Depending on which side of the pitch you stood, the 1990 Act was a masterly example of either moderate pessimism or moderate optimism, which steered a middle way through the field of reproductive science, between unfettered experimentation and the outlawing of procedures that were novel and controversial at the time. After a certain amount of ritual grandstanding on both sides of the debate, this is the approach we will almost certainly adopt to the new advances in human genetics. But we ought to keep our minds open to some of the sensitive issues that will confront us. One of the difficulties is that the subject is inescapably linked to memories of the pseudo-science of eugenics, with its fascist echoes. The word eugenics is probably beyond rehabilitation, but behind it lies a morally complex issue. Theoretically, it will soon be possible to perform gene therapy to cure or prevent inheritable genetic disease. These therapies in themselves raise interesting ethical problems to which I'll return, but the issue I want to look at briefly now is their likely impact upon existing people with disabilities. It is not too difficult to see why the disabled community might come to interpret these procedures as an attack upon their own value as human beings. We might argue that to try to mend a particular defect is far from saying that those who possess it are less human than the rest of us. Even more complex will be the ethics of the reverse possibility, whereby a disabled couple, such as a profoundly deaf one, might invoke the process in order to design the birth of a disabled child who can be fully at home in its parent's culture. Is there any way in which a truly multicultural society could learn to live with intentionally produced disability? If, as the disabled community claims, disability is socially constructed, might it not be possible to deconstruct it in this way and thereby create genuinely plural communities? We are going to have to breathe deeply and keep our wits about us as we negotiate some of these possibilities. When gene therapy is perfected, it will come in two possible forms, each with its own ethical difficulties. It could be performed using somatic cells, which make up most of the cells in the body, or germ cells from sperm or eggs. Somatic cell gene therapy would only affect the individual who was treated, whereas germ cell therapy would pass the altered genes on to the next generation. In 1989 the government set up a committee to consider the ethics of gene therapy. Its report in 1992 concluded that \"somatic cell gene therapy will be a new kind of treatment, but it does not represent a major departure from established medical practice; nor does it pose new ethical challenges.\" Where it is likely to become controversial, however, is when it is applied to procedures for the enhancement of physical characteristics, such as height or appearance. Though it will doubtless provoke debate, it would be hard to argue that using somatic cell gene therapy for these purposes would be more ethically problematic than getting a nose job or a breast enhancement using existing procedures. Nevertheless, we can expect the tabloids to have a field day with this therapy when it comes on-stream. Germ cell gene therapy, if it is ever made safe, will raise a much more difficult issue. Would it be unethical to apply a technique that would affect an individual prior to conception? The philosopher John Harris argues that, if the technique is proved to be safe and efficacious, it would be unethical not to apply it, because parents have an obligation to avoid harm to their unborn children. However, the real issue here is the moral status of the human embryo. Germ cell gene therapy will only be perfected and made safe after years of experimentation on embryos. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act permits experiments on embryos up to 14 days, or on the appearance of the neural or primitive streak. But this is one of the most controversial aspects of the act and one which significant elements in British society still reject. Most of us would probably apply a doctrine of incremental potentiality to human gametes, so that the moral status of the entity increases the closer it gets to term. The Roman Catholic Church, however, accords full human status to the embryo from the beginning, so it condemns experiments on embryos as the moral equivalent of the torture of human beings. This is an example of the kind of disagreement that is inevitable in a plural society. But those of us who find these developments unproblematic ought to remember that they will be painful for intact moral communities that have a fixed perspective on the status of human gametes. If we are to avoid the culture wars that so disfigure the USA we'll have to negotiate these complexities with great care. \u0095 Richard Holloway is bishop of Edinburgh and from 1991-97 was a member of the Human Fertilisation and Embryo Authority",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>A year ago, I debunked the choice of Janet Street-Porter as editor of the Independent on Sunday. I argued then that she didn't have the nous to run the paper and, worse still, might do it irreparable harm. The Sindy, I predicted, would lose senior staff, credibility and sales in that order. </p> <p>Naturally enough, the man who appointed her, Simon Kelner, editor-in-chief of the Independent titles, thought both the tone of my article and many of its specific criticisms were wholly wrong. When we bumped into each other days later at the Groucho club - where else? - he held on to his temper, shrugged his shoulders, and said, in effect, time will tell, you'll see, Janet is a winner. </p> <p>You may recall her own ambitions for her paper. A multicultural society, she wrote at the time, requires \"a polymorphous journal . . . all-encompassing, tolerant in our sympathies, generous in our coverage\". More prosaically, she told me that she aimed to make it \"slightly more accessible, less austere and improve the presentation\". </p> <p>So, as she prepares to celebrate the first anniversary of her appointment, it's an appropriate moment to consider whether Street-Porter has accomplished what she set out to do and if my trenchant assault was wide of the mark. </p> <p>First, let's admit that meltdown hasn't occurred. The paper is not in imminent danger of collapse. She hasn't done anything outrageous or eccentric enough to frighten the horses. Indeed, she has wisely chosen to make evolutionary changes rather than risking a revolution. </p> <p>She weathered the storm of initial desertions by writers such as AN Wilson and Craig Brown (creator of the sadly-missed Wallace Arnold). For a long time, apart from changes of emphasis to the culture and reality sections, and the introduction of her own column on the leader page, it was difficult to divine that the former editor, Kim Fletcher, had departed. </p> <p>That, in fairness, confirmed what she had originally told me: \"I have ideas about what I'd like to do, but I intend to settle into the job first, talk to everyone and discover what they think.\" Street-Porter's first key decision was to appoint Michael Williams as her deputy. An experienced journalist, with a background as both a news and production executive, he was seen as a sensible, complementary, steadying hand. </p> <p>After that, we had to wait until February for the arrival of Street-Porter's revamp. Reality became an A4-sized magazine; the Sunday Review magazine was remade; a business section emerged from its hiding place within sport and travel took its place; the culture pages were reconfigured with Will Self joining as TV critic; and the front page itself took on a new appearance. </p> <p>Undoubtedly, these changes have made the paper more accessible. A rival editor thought it \"much warmer\" and \"really quite good\", though he was uncertain why the review, which had long been viewed as the Sindy's unique selling proposition, was changed unnecessarily. </p> <p>I couldn't, and still can't, see the point of Reality. Its content seems to cry out for a larger format. Then again, the content is so marginal it really wouldn't matter if it wasn't there at all. It looks like an advertising supplement and is in desperate need of improved production values. </p> <p>My main criticism in February was about the lack of regular, serious, heavyweight pundits. This has recently been addressed: Steve Richards, the New Statesman's ornament, is to become chief political commentator from September, and Colin Brown is to be political editor. </p> <p>A raft of new appointments were also announced last week in other sections too. The business section, which was dire, has certainly improved under the energetic leadership of Jason Nisse, but there is a way to go yet. </p> <p>Kelner says: \"I think Janet's year has gone very well and she has put her stamp on the paper. It is developing into a strong product.\" How then have the public reacted to the Street-Porter Sindy? It has to be said, before we consider the paper's own circulation since her arrival, that the whole market has been hit by a slump in the past year. </p> <p>Selling papers, especially on a Sunday, has been very difficult indeed.

      "bodyText": "A year ago, I debunked the choice of Janet Street-Porter as editor of the Independent on Sunday. I argued then that she didn't have the nous to run the paper and, worse still, might do it irreparable harm. The Sindy, I predicted, would lose senior staff, credibility and sales in that order. Naturally enough, the man who appointed her, Simon Kelner, editor-in-chief of the Independent titles, thought both the tone of my article and many of its specific criticisms were wholly wrong. When we bumped into each other days later at the Groucho club - where else? - he held on to his temper, shrugged his shoulders, and said, in effect, time will tell, you'll see, Janet is a winner. You may recall her own ambitions for her paper. A multicultural society, she wrote at the time, requires \"a polymorphous journal . . . all-encompassing, tolerant in our sympathies, generous in our coverage\". More prosaically, she told me that she aimed to make it \"slightly more accessible, less austere and improve the presentation\". So, as she prepares to celebrate the first anniversary of her appointment, it's an appropriate moment to consider whether Street-Porter has accomplished what she set out to do and if my trenchant assault was wide of the mark. First, let's admit that meltdown hasn't occurred. The paper is not in imminent danger of collapse. She hasn't done anything outrageous or eccentric enough to frighten the horses. Indeed, she has wisely chosen to make evolutionary changes rather than risking a revolution. She weathered the storm of initial desertions by writers such as AN Wilson and Craig Brown (creator of the sadly-missed Wallace Arnold). For a long time, apart from changes of emphasis to the culture and reality sections, and the introduction of her own column on the leader page, it was difficult to divine that the former editor, Kim Fletcher, had departed. That, in fairness, confirmed what she had originally told me: \"I have ideas about what I'd like to do, but I intend to settle into the job first, talk to everyone and discover what they think.\" Street-Porter's first key decision was to appoint Michael Williams as her deputy. An experienced journalist, with a background as both a news and production executive, he was seen as a sensible, complementary, steadying hand. After that, we had to wait until February for the arrival of Street-Porter's revamp. Reality became an A4-sized magazine; the Sunday Review magazine was remade; a business section emerged from its hiding place within sport and travel took its place; the culture pages were reconfigured with Will Self joining as TV critic; and the front page itself took on a new appearance. Undoubtedly, these changes have made the paper more accessible. A rival editor thought it \"much warmer\" and \"really quite good\", though he was uncertain why the review, which had long been viewed as the Sindy's unique selling proposition, was changed unnecessarily. I couldn't, and still can't, see the point of Reality. Its content seems to cry out for a larger format. Then again, the content is so marginal it really wouldn't matter if it wasn't there at all. It looks like an advertising supplement and is in desperate need of improved production values. My main criticism in February was about the lack of regular, serious, heavyweight pundits. This has recently been addressed: Steve Richards, the New Statesman's ornament, is to become chief political commentator from September, and Colin Brown is to be political editor. A raft of new appointments were also announced last week in other sections too. The business section, which was dire, has certainly improved under the energetic leadership of Jason Nisse, but there is a way to go yet. Kelner says: \"I think Janet's year has gone very well and she has put her stamp on the paper. It is developing into a strong product.\" How then have the public reacted to the Street-Porter Sindy? It has to be said, before we consider the paper's own circulation since her arrival, that the whole market has been hit by a slump in the past year. Selling papers, especially on a Sunday, has been very difficult indeed. To mitigate the problem - or perhaps that should be crisis - papers have adopted a range of tactics to maintain their headline sales figures, including price-cutting, pre-paid subscriptions, bulk \"freebies\" and publishing in foreign lands. The Sindy's preferred methods have been cutting the cover price and relying on bulks. In June last year, when Street-Porter took over, the paper's total sale was 242,238. Of these, some 29,000 were sold at a discount and 22,000 were given away. Last month, the total was 250,142. But 66,000 were discounted and bulk sales had reached more than 35,000. For the past three weeks, the Sindy - which is supposed to cost \u00a31.10 - has been selling in various regions for just 50p. It is estimated that the paper is regularly sacrificing at least \u00a3300,000 a week in revenue to boost its sale. The true cost is greater when bulks are added on. The positive side of these figures is that the Sindy's owner, Tony O'Reilly's Independent Newspapers, is obviously still very committed to the paper.

Mr Blair told reporters in Downing Street: \"I am very pleased that the agreement that was made a few weeks ago in Northern Ireland has been honoured. The confidence measure that we were promised has been put in place\". The inspectors \"were shown a substantial quantity of IRA arms, including explosives\" and \"have ensured the weapons are secure and cannot be used without their becoming aware that this has happened\", they said in a report to Ulster's decommissioning body. Agreement to inspections of arms dumps broke the deadlock which threatened to unravel the peace process earlier this year. However, Ulster Unionist MP Jeffrey Donaldson expressed caution about whether, if inspections had taken place, it represented a breakthrough. On BBC Radio 4, Mr Donaldson said: \"I think the question we need to know is that, if these arms dump inspections have taken place, whether this is the beginning of a process that will lead to the actual decommissioning of those weapons as required by the Belfast agreement, or whether this is as good as it gets? \"I think that is the key question.\" The Lagan Valley MP added: \"If these IRA arms dumps have now been identified - and my understanding was that it was to have been three arms dumps made available for inspection - then we want to know if General de Chastelain, the head of the independent commission, can report if the IRA have appointed their go-between again. \"And whether they have given any indication to him at this stage that they are actually going to decommission any of these weapons.\"",

      "body": "<p>After qualifying for the knock-out stage thanks to two goals in injury time against Yugoslavia last Wednesday, Spain last night spurned the chance to repeat the feat against the world champions. </p> <p>They were trailing 2-1 with one minute left when Fabien Barthez impeded Abelardo after spilling the ball near his goalline. But Raul drove the penalty kick - Spain's second of the match - over the bar, allowing the tournament favourites to proceed to a semi-final meeting with Portugal on Wednesday. </p> <p>Both sides began the match as though they had just watched the Dutch putting six goals past Yugoslavia and fancied themselves capable of emulating the feat. Spain lined up with three forwards - Alfonso, Raul and Pedro Munitis - while France emphasised the resources available to Roger Lemerre by laying aside the experiment with the Thierry Henry-Nicolas Anelka twin spearhead and trying a formula involving Christophe Dugarry and Youri Djorkaeff on the wings, flanking Henry. Emmanuel Petit, kept out by a knee injury suffered in the match against the Czech Republic, was replaced alongside Didier Deschamps by his Arsenal team-mate Patrick Vieira. </p> <p>Spain were confronting a back four that had not lost a match together since first appearing en bloc in the 3-1 defeat of Bulgaria in Euro 96. All seven of France's subsequent defeats had come with some disruption or other to the defensive alignment of Lilian Thuram, Laurent Blanc, Marcel Desailly and Bixente Lizarazu. That meant four years and 23 matches of invincibility for this remarkable quartet, now averaging 30 years of age and with an aggregate of 279 caps. </p> <p>\"Over time, we've learnt that we can trust each other,\" Blanc said last week. \"There's a great complicity between us.\" \"Maybe you could find better individual players,\" Desailly added, \"but together we're very, very strong.\" </p> <p>The size of the task facing the Spanish was illustrated when Thuram gave the ball away to Raul in a dangerous position wide on the right after 15 minutes and then, caught badly out of position, used his telescopic legs to block the cross. The assault continued when Barthez tipped Guardiola's free-kick over the bar after 18 minutes, and two minutes later Alfonso split the France defence with a ball that Raul accepted before clipping a lob that drew another fingertip save from the goalkeeper. </p> <p>Just when the crowd was becoming convinced that no player of any era had ever controlled the ball with a more perfect touch than Zidane, on the half-hour the two-goal hero of the World Cup final met Dugarry's centre from the right with an astonishingly comprehensive miskick when alone in front of the unprotected Santiago Canizares. </p> <p>Two minutes later Zidane put matters right when he curled a right-footed free-kick from 25 yards past Canizares's right hand, the goalkeeper's anticipation insufficient to counter the accuracy of the strike. </p> <p>Within five minutes Spain had drawn level. When Thuram caught the back of Raul's legs as the Real Madrid forward ran on to another pass from Alfonso, Pierluigi Collina's reaction was immediate and Mendieta coolly converted the penalty. </p> <p>But the scoring in such a free-flowing and wholehearted match did not deserve to be restricted to dead-ball kicks, and two minutes before half-time Djorkaeff ran on to Vieira's pass across the edge of the area to smash a rising drive through the gap between Canizares's left hand and the near post, the forward's second goal of the tournament. </p> <p>A fiercely but cleanly contested game yielded a flurry of yellow cards in the third quarter: Alfonso for bringing down Didier Deschamps, Deschamps for fouling Munitis, Guardiola for tripping Djorkaeff and Paco for dragging Henry down. Meanwhile Mendieta had been replaced by Ismael Urzaiz, which meant that Lizarazu had won the battle of the Basques on his side of the pitch. </p> <p>Spain's pressure was unrelenting but was being neutralised outside the danger zone by the efforts of the French midfield, with Vieira's tackling always prominent. But Guardiola's free-kicks were looking increasingly dangerous and Vieira needed all his height to glance one diagonal effort behind for a corner.</p>",

      "bodyText": "After qualifying for the knock-out stage thanks to two goals in injury time against Yugoslavia last Wednesday, Spain last night spurned the chance to repeat the feat against the world champions. They were trailing 2-1 with one minute left when Fabien Barthez impeded Abelardo after spilling the ball near his goalline. But Raul drove the penalty kick - Spain's second of the match - over the bar, allowing the tournament favourites to proceed to a semi-final meeting with Portugal on Wednesday. Both sides began the match as though they had just watched the Dutch putting six goals past Yugoslavia and fancied themselves capable of emulating the feat. Spain lined up with three forwards - Alfonso, Raul and Pedro Munitis - while France emphasised the resources available to Roger Lemerre by laying aside the experiment with the Thierry Henry-Nicolas Anelka twin spearhead and trying a formula involving Christophe Dugarry and Youri Djorkaeff on the wings, flanking Henry. Emmanuel Petit, kept out by a knee injury suffered in the match against the Czech Republic, was replaced alongside Didier Deschamps by his Arsenal team-mate Patrick Vieira. Spain were confronting a back four that had not lost a match together since first appearing en bloc in the 3-1 defeat of Bulgaria in Euro 96. All seven of France's subsequent defeats had come with some disruption or other to the defensive alignment of Lilian Thuram, Laurent Blanc, Marcel Desailly and Bixente Lizarazu. That meant four years and 23 matches of invincibility for this remarkable quartet, now averaging 30 years of age and with an aggregate of 279 caps. \"Over time, we've learnt that we can trust each other,\" Blanc said last week. \"There's a great complicity between us.\" \"Maybe you could find better individual players,\" Desailly added, \"but together we're very, very strong.\" The size of the task facing the Spanish was illustrated when Thuram gave the ball away to Raul in a dangerous position wide on the right after 15 minutes and then, caught badly out of position, used his telescopic legs to block the cross. The assault continued when Barthez tipped Guardiola's free-kick over the bar after 18 minutes, and two minutes later Alfonso split the France defence with a ball that Raul accepted before clipping a lob that drew another fingertip save from the goalkeeper. Just when the crowd was becoming convinced that no player of any era had ever controlled the ball with a more perfect touch than Zidane, on the half-hour the two-goal hero of the World Cup final met Dugarry's centre from the right with an astonishingly comprehensive miskick when alone in front of the unprotected Santiago Canizares. Two minutes later Zidane put matters right when he curled a right-footed free-kick from 25 yards past Canizares's right hand, the goalkeeper's anticipation insufficient to counter the accuracy of the strike. Within five minutes Spain had drawn level. When Thuram caught the back of Raul's legs as the Real Madrid forward ran on to another pass from Alfonso, Pierluigi Collina's reaction was immediate and Mendieta coolly converted the penalty. But the scoring in such a free-flowing and wholehearted match did not deserve to be restricted to dead-ball kicks, and two minutes before half-time Djorkaeff ran on to Vieira's pass across the edge of the area to smash a rising drive through the gap between Canizares's left hand and the near post, the forward's second goal of the tournament. A fiercely but cleanly contested game yielded a flurry of yellow cards in the third quarter: Alfonso for bringing down Didier Deschamps, Deschamps for fouling Munitis, Guardiola for tripping Djorkaeff and Paco for dragging Henry down. Meanwhile Mendieta had been replaced by Ismael Urzaiz, which meant that Lizarazu had won the battle of the Basques on his side of the pitch. Spain's pressure was unrelenting but was being neutralised outside the danger zone by the efforts of the French midfield, with Vieira's tackling always prominent. But Guardiola's free-kicks were looking increasingly dangerous and Vieira needed all his height to glance one diagonal effort behind for a corner.",

We accepted our appointment on the basis of terms of reference set out in a joint statement issued by the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach and the statement by the leadership of the IRA on 6 May 2000. In its statement of 6 May, the IRA leadership pledged to initiate a process that will completely and verifiably put IRA arms beyond use in the context of the statement made by the two Governments on 5 May, 2000. Besides undertaking to resume contact with the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning (IICD), the IRA leadership agreed to put in place within weeks a confidence-building measure to confirm that their weapons remain secure. We see our mandate as being the inspection of the contents of a number of IRA arms dumps, reporting to the IICD that we have done so, and re-inspecting these dumps regularly to ensure that the weapons have remained secure. In preparing for the first inspection visit, we were briefed by the British Prime Minister, the Irish Foreign Minister, the British Secretary of State and the Commissioners of the IICD. We also consulted most of the parties that have endorsed the Good Friday Agreement. In addition, we consulted independent specialists in the field of arms control, who had previously participated in arms inspections elsewhere and had expertise in the area of verification.

But this is only the first step in a much longer process of discovery.\" </p> <p>But today's announcement, which is likely to accelerate the new biotech gold rush, may only be about to happen because British scientists forced the pace. Until late last week, their American partners were denying knowledge of an announcement and were still trying to strike an accord with Craig Venter, head of the US biotech firm Celera Genomics, which entered the field late but threatened to finish first - and offer the human genome for sale. </p> <p>This move provoked furious exchanges between human genome scientists and Dr Venter. The British scientists and their US colleagues have always insisted that the data should be available freely, immediately, and to everybody. Earlier this year President Bill Clinton and Tony Blair declared their joint support for this approach. </p> <p>Britain has undertaken one-third of the $3bn project, funded by the Wellcome Trust, the world's leading medical charity. The US share was underwritten by the taxpayer through the national institutes of health. </p> <p>Today's announcement, in London and Washington, is likely to be made jointly with Celera. That both sides are prepared to declare a draw is because of weeks of behind-the-scenes diplomacy in the scientific networks. </p> <p>\"All of us in the scientific community have been a little bit appalled by all of the negative press that's surrounding what we view as a real pivotal event in the history of mankind,\" said Roy Whitfield, chief of Incyte, a biotech firm in California. \"So it would be lovely if people would get back to how this builds for the future.\" </p> <p>Last week, as word of a joint or at least simultaneous statement leaked out, Celera's stock shot up by $18.50 to $138.50 before falling to $125 on Friday. The betting in Washington is that the announcement will be made without reference to the bitter exchanges of recent months, and that both teams will later publish their papers simultaneously, in the same journal, Science. </p> <p>\"I think this is a great time in biology. I would describe it as the beginning of thousands of races,\" said Dr Whitfield. \"If you have colon cancer, the race is about curing colon cancer. If you have arthritis, it's a race to cure arthritis. It's the start of a really long race to have a tremendous impact on human health.\" </p> <p>The \"first draft\" is a milestone rather than a winning post, a beginning rather than an end. But the new data will trigger a flurry of new kinds of research. A Japanese group has just announced that it will sequence the entire genome of humankind's nearest relative, the chimpanzee - in the hope of shedding light on the origins of intelligence, such as language, logic and thinking, which only human beings possess. Other teams have begun to apply genetics to the problems of ageing, of neurodegenerative diseases, and of cancer. </p> <p>Francis Collins of the US national institutes of health said: \"It is probably the most important scientific effort mankind has ever mounted, and that includes splitting the atom and going to the moon.\" </p> <p>Roland Wolf of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund said: \"The sequencing of the human genome represents one of the great achievements in human science. It really will be a landmark in the evolution of man.\"</p>",

That both sides are prepared to declare a draw is because of weeks of behind-the-scenes diplomacy in the scientific networks. \"All of us in the scientific community have been a little bit appalled by all of the negative press that's surrounding what we view as a real pivotal event in the history of mankind,\" said Roy Whitfield, chief of Incyte, a biotech firm in California. \"So it would be lovely if people would get back to how this builds for the future.\" Last week, as word of a joint or at least simultaneous statement leaked out, Celera's stock shot up by $18.50 to $138.50 before falling to $125 on Friday. The betting in Washington is that the announcement will be made without reference to the bitter exchanges of recent months, and that both teams will later publish their papers simultaneously, in the same journal, Science. \"I think this is a great time in biology. I would describe it as the beginning of thousands of races,\" said Dr Whitfield. \"If you have colon cancer, the race is about curing colon cancer. If you have arthritis, it's a race to cure arthritis. It's the start of a really long race to have a tremendous impact on human health.\" The \"first draft\" is a milestone rather than a winning post, a beginning rather than an end. But the new data will trigger a flurry of new kinds of research. A Japanese group has just announced that it will sequence the entire genome of humankind's nearest relative, the chimpanzee - in the hope of shedding light on the origins of intelligence, such as language, logic and thinking, which only human beings possess. Other teams have begun to apply genetics to the problems of ageing, of neurodegenerative diseases, and of cancer. Francis Collins of the US national institutes of health said: \"It is probably the most important scientific effort mankind has ever mounted, and that includes splitting the atom and going to the moon.\" Roland Wolf of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund said: \"The sequencing of the human genome represents one of the great achievements in human science. It really will be a landmark in the evolution of man.\"",

      "bodyText": "The Royal Navy could set out to sea in a maritime version of Ikea furniture, if a novel plan to build DIY ship kits succeeds on the Tyne. A \u00a36m steel-cutting plant is set to test the new system of making boxed and numbered parts, which can then be sent like flat-pack cupboards for assembly anywhere in the world. Modelled on a Dutch experiment, the computer-aided process aims to bring shipbuilding back to Swan Hunter, one of the industry's most famous names, which has survived on offshore rig work since bankruptcy and partial rescue in 1994. The grand old days of champagne launches are less likely to return, however, with most of the expected orders leaving the Tyne in flat-pack containers on cargo ships. The ship kit steel plant has the potential to bring 350 jobs to Swan's Tyneside yard, according to the company, more than doubling the 300-strong workforce in an area with 13% unemployment. The site will specialise in robot-controlled steel-cutting. \"This will be our industry's equivalent of Ikea,\" said Jaap Kroese, the Dutch businessman who resurrected Swan's name when the company closed in 1994. \"It may not be like the old days when people lined the riverbanks to see the ships sailing out but, nonetheless, Swan Hunter will be building ships and, more importantly, there will be a future for workers.\" Two troop landing ships for the Ministry of Defence could be the first kit-built vessels in Britain if Swan wins a \u00a3140m tender in competition with two other British yards.",

So, even with his natural solidity, he has gone down the injury path of so many young bowlers. But there is no evidence of a suspect temperament, which is regarded as yeoman-solid. \"Give him the ball and he gets on with it, no fuss,\" is the general observation. He may not get the chance just yet but clearly he is one for the future.

      "body": "<p>I bumped into a familiar face in the Grand Place, Brussels, last week; he was an ITN cameraman. \"We've got some brilliant pictures of Turks and Belgians kicking shit out of each other, Charlie,\" he told me. \"That should help to balance the coverage,\" I naively replied. \"Nah, we've been told they only want pics of the English causing trouble.\" </p> <p>For 10 days I followed England's football fortunes with the BBC Radio 5 Live news team and the realisation that TV news was actually conniving with the buffoons from Uefa to get England kicked out of Euro 2000 made me even more angry with them than I was with the hooligans. </p> <p>My experience in dealing with the media has taught me that television news can easily distort events, but never have I seen such distortion as I witnessed in Holland and Belgian last week. It is of course not all the fault of some TV editor who wants pictures to fit his story - the very fact that the Belgium police decided to try out their new toy, which they call water cannon, meant that there would only be one image left on our minds. No amount of explanation of what really happened on the radio by the 5 Live team could alter that. </p> <p>The media had come to the Low Countries prepared for trouble from the England fans. Some were more prepared than others. Having learned from their experience in France in 1998, the 5 Live team had spent months preparing \"safe\" venues for reporters and presenters to send their stories back to England. Talksport covered events from a hotel room in Amsterdam and ITN and BBC TV news used Bill Neely and Jon Sopel - reporters with whom I enjoyed battling in my past life as a government press officer, but who are more used to covering diplomatic summits than football thugs. No one, however, had a better view of what was happening in Eindhoven and Charleroi than 5 Live. All the papers of course had their \"hoolie watch\" teams ready to report on \"England's shame\". The problem for them was that as we approached the first game in Eindhoven there were very few hoolies to report on. </p> <p>The Dutch police had done their homework and ensured that the few were not going to wreck the party for the many. For the first time since I began following England I actually enjoyed the pre-match festivities and was not ashamed to be English. I spent my first England away trip in a campsite in Turin in 1980 and ended up being tear-gassed by the Italian police. This was my sixth campaign away with England and I began to believe that although we had no chance of winning the championship, or even getting past the first stage, at least the fans were behaving themselves. This did not suit everyone, however. </p> <p>Following the police press conference where we were told that all was peaceful and that there had been three arrests for ticket touting and one for a fan getting up to \"hanky-panky\" with a flag pole, Jon Sopel for BBC TV news had to file his report. He could have done what every other foreign TV reporter had done and filmed his piece in the main square where everyone was having a party. Instead he found a spot miles away where the backdrop was a line of police vehicles and police horses. The image was clear for viewers back home to see, but it was a false one. Why let the facts get in the way of good pictures? </p> <p>Once inside the stadium it was clear that thousands of genuine England fans had procured most of the tickets. There were hundreds of them at the Portugal end but not a hint of trouble, and for the first time ever they all sat in silence during the opposition's anthem and actually applauded it. Even though we lost the game we set off for Charleroi happy that for once the England fans had behaved and that there seemed to be a new mood amongst them. </p> <p>The long break before the next game against Germany meant that we had time to visit the England training camp. The English media centre in Spa was bigger than for a European political summit, and the control of the press even more blatant than by Alastair Campbell. Before my colleague Victoria Derbyshire was allowed to interview Sol Campbell she had to agree not to ask him anything about Spurs, even though this was the day that they had agreed to sell David Ginola. The players had been so well briefed not to say anything interesting that the interviews were hardly worth broadcasting. </p> <p>Following a quick spin from the FA that the BBC was the \"people's choice\" for their live games, we returned to Charleroi and the most unforgettable night of the tournament as thousands of Italians celebrated their victory over Belgium. We broadcast the celebration into Up All Night on 5 Live, believing that Chaleroi would be one long party. </p> <p>We reported all next day about the England fans arriving and enjoying themselves and the brief altercation with a French fan chasing some English people with an cosh, and later the stabbing of an English fan (in the back) by a local Turkish youth. When we were told that his life was in danger we held back from reporting it. Five Live was being broadcast in Charleroi on an FM frequency twice daily for the fans, and such a report would undoubtedly have inflamed the situation. Actually, the fan was OK but the incident showed how important it was to have experienced producers around. </p> <p>Meanwhile, back in Brussels, the Belgian police and the TV news got what they wanted. Violence. Once the telly had the pictures of the Belgian police firing teargas into pubs and arresting everyone inside, they had their story. The real story of the fans just having a quiet drink, being held for 10 hours and sent home without their luggage would have to wait for the inside pages of the posh papers a few days later or the Nicky Campbell show on 5 Live. </p> <p>The police in Charleroi just could not wait for their turn. Also waiting in the main square were the world's media. I counted at least 50 TV cameras ready to witness the inevitable. On the radio, our team reported the events from 6am. No chairs had been cleared, strong beer was readily available and the police let gangs of Germans into the square. They obligingly tipped off the TV crews that they were going in to arrest some Germans and the rest is history. Gordon Farquhar, the experienced 5 Live sports news reporter, scored the level of violence as three out of 10, but who cared about the radio? The incident with the water cannon that the TV reported actually lasted no more than 10 minutes, while 15,000 England fans enjoying themselves with Germans in the hundreds of bars around the square received no coverage. ITN reported the water cannon scenes as effective policing, so effective that Bill Neely got hit in the face by a fan. Those nutters in the square loved every minute of it and even cheered when the water cannon returned. </p> <p>These great TV pictures enabled those not there, and some who were, to talk rubbish. The Independent leader talked about the fans' \"rampage through the Low Countries\". What rampage? Charles Bremner of the Times, who normally covers the bureaucrats in Brussels, told us that \"the battered Charleroi residents were happy to see England fans go home\". I was in Charleroi for seven days and that is simply not true. </p> <p>The tabloids, as you would expect, were even worse. Jeff Powell for the Mail, allegedly writing from Charleroi but probably from his five-star hotel in Spa, said that the rest of the tournament has been relieved of the \"rioting fans\". Powell had obviously not read the local paper in Charleroi which was actually very complimentary about the English, and reported \"Riot, what riot?\". Ian Wooldridge, writing from the safety of a bar in South Africa after \"a couple of whiskies\", said: \"This mindless minority nonsense won't wash any more.\" He complains about academic pontificating on Radio 5 Live and being patronising about football writers. How can anyone take seriously someone who in the same rant tells us that the only man who ever got it right was [ex-sports minister] Colin Moynihan? </p> <p>No one has criticised the racist scum, plankton and pond life that follows England more than me, but Jack Straw also failed to act decisively and gave Uefa the opportunity to threaten our expulsion. Their hypocrisy is staggering. Turkish fans can murder Leeds fans and that is \"nothing to do with football\". If so, then neither were the English nutters anything to do with football. The lowest point of our coverage of Euro 2000, however, was arriving back at our hotel following our exit to see the Panorama film on the \"hoolies\". They would have loved it and Panorama has just made them heroes amongst their peers, just as they did the Millwall F Troop in the 70s. </p> <p>The Guardian's \"fan in a van\" is relieved it is all over. He took his life in his hands by driving through parts of Belgium in a British van, but maybe he should take a video camera with him next time and record the fans' view for TV. The pen may be mightier than the sword but it's not as powerful as television. How else could you explain someone as intelligent as Martin Kelner telling us in the Guardian that he thought it was \"a shame the Belgium riot police were not equipped with real bullets\"?</p>",

Last week he did, proving two things: that we are not against wearing of suits per se and that we have the good sense to dress for the occasion. This particular occasion was a trip to the Houses of Parliament. </p> <p>We have approached a prominent public figure to take a place on our board as a non-executive director. The questions he asked are a measure of how the e-commerce environment has changed. </p> <p>Almost immediately, he rattled off questions such as: \"what are your revenue streams?\" and: \"how many customers do you need to move into profit?\" </p> <p>Six months ago, profit was almost considered a dirty word in the world of e-commerce. Now it is one of the first things people ask about. We impressed on him that Rools is a sustainable business and will eventually generate profits. </p> <p>The atmosphere relaxed a little and our host gave us a quick summary of his involvement in internet businesses and went into what motivated him. To his credit, it seemed that he was getting involved because they are of interest to him, not based on the simple economics and who pays the most. </p> <p>A brief interruption in the form of the division bell for a vote and we wrapped up the conversation. </p> <p>The final point he made was that although the personal incentive to get involved would not be the deciding factor, there had to be enough of an incentive to make the devotion of time and energy worthwhile. </p> <p>Trying to get celebrity endorsement has so far been only a marginally less exacting experience. Since William Shatner made a well-publicised second fortune through his involvement with US dot.com Priceline, celebrities have become very switched on to the potential upside of getting involved in the new economy. </p> <p>A few days ago it was announced that David Beckham and Britney Spears were each going to be heavily involved in separate online ventures. We have been to see a couple of celebrity agents, in settings that are not quite as imposing as the House. These agents have been at least as commercially clued-up as any of our partners and in each case they wanted to gain a thorough understanding of the business. Their celebrity clients have very clear strategies and have put far more thought into the next five years and how they want to position themselves than either of us ever did for our careers. They have a further requirement, beyond enthusiasm for the business and the incentives it can offer. The business has to fit the professional and media profile they have built and are going to develop in the future. </p> <p>For instance we know of one celebrity who plans to move from children's television to mainstream programming next year and is looking to get involved with e-commerce companies that will help support such a move. </p> <p>All these meetings last week seemed to go well. Whatever comes out of them, they were certainly a colourful and welcome addition to the wide range of positive, negative and downright unusual experiences that we have had since we started this business. </p> <p>\u0095 Adam Hamdy and Guy Mallison are the co-founders of Rools.com, a service that enables teenagers to buy online without a credit card.</p>",

      "bodyText": "One colleague who insists on wearing suits all the time was convinced he would catch each of us in one before long. Last week he did, proving two things: that we are not against wearing of suits per se and that we have the good sense to dress for the occasion. This particular occasion was a trip to the Houses of Parliament. We have approached a prominent public figure to take a place on our board as a non-executive director. The questions he asked are a measure of how the e-commerce environment has changed. Almost immediately, he rattled off questions such as: \"what are your revenue streams?\" and: \"how many customers do you need to move into profit?\" Six months ago, profit was almost considered a dirty word in the world of e-commerce. Now it is one of the first things people ask about. We impressed on him that Rools is a sustainable business and will eventually generate profits. The atmosphere relaxed a little and our host gave us a quick summary of his involvement in internet businesses and went into what motivated him. To his credit, it seemed that he was getting involved because they are of interest to him, not based on the simple economics and who pays the most. A brief interruption in the form of the division bell for a vote and we wrapped up the conversation. The final point he made was that although the personal incentive to get involved would not be the deciding factor, there had to be enough of an incentive to make the devotion of time and energy worthwhile. Trying to get celebrity endorsement has so far been only a marginally less exacting experience. Since William Shatner made a well-publicised second fortune through his involvement with US dot.com Priceline, celebrities have become very switched on to the potential upside of getting involved in the new economy. A few days ago it was announced that David Beckham and Britney Spears were each going to be heavily involved in separate online ventures. We have been to see a couple of celebrity agents, in settings that are not quite as imposing as the House. These agents have been at least as commercially clued-up as any of our partners and in each case they wanted to gain a thorough understanding of the business. Their celebrity clients have very clear strategies and have put far more thought into the next five years and how they want to position themselves than either of us ever did for our careers. They have a further requirement, beyond enthusiasm for the business and the incentives it can offer. The business has to fit the professional and media profile they have built and are going to develop in the future. For instance we know of one celebrity who plans to move from children's television to mainstream programming next year and is looking to get involved with e-commerce companies that will help support such a move. All these meetings last week seemed to go well. Whatever comes out of them, they were certainly a colourful and welcome addition to the wide range of positive, negative and downright unusual experiences that we have had since we started this business. \u0095 Adam Hamdy and Guy Mallison are the co-founders of Rools.com, a service that enables teenagers to buy online without a credit card.",

The poll showed 58% of GPs arranged complementary treatments for patients, with the most popular therapies being acupuncture (47%), osteopathy (30%) and homeopathy (25%). The BMA called on the body charged with assessing drugs and treatments, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (Nice), to issue guidance on how acupuncture should be used within the health service.

Each year more than 1m workers are injured, and 400 people are killed in work-related activities, at an annual cost to the country of around \u00a318bn. To combat the risks, the government has joined the Health and Safety Commission to set targets to reduce work-related deaths and injury. They have introduced a 10-point strategy and an action plan, to help employers improve conditions. </p> <p> \u0095 Hot stuff</p> <p> If you sit by a sunny window at work, you'll be almost as hot as if you were sitting outside, because glass lets through 90% of the sun's heat.

      "bodyText": "\u0095 Danger at work For many British employees, the workplace is a potentially dangerous environment. Each year more than 1m workers are injured, and 400 people are killed in work-related activities, at an annual cost to the country of around \u00a318bn. To combat the risks, the government has joined the Health and Safety Commission to set targets to reduce work-related deaths and injury. They have introduced a 10-point strategy and an action plan, to help employers improve conditions. \u0095 Hot stuff If you sit by a sunny window at work, you'll be almost as hot as if you were sitting outside, because glass lets through 90% of the sun's heat.

      "bodyText": "The Liberal Democratic party, which has ruled Japan for all but two of the past 45 years, was returned to power last night despite the unpopularity of its prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, and a government that has overseen four years of record unemployment, bankruptcy and suicide. With 95% of the votes counted, the LDP was certain of victory with the help of its coalition allies. In effect, Japan opted for the devil it knows - a decision which will mean business as usual for the world's second biggest economy. But strong gains by the opposition and a low turnout will ensure that the heat remains on Mr Mori, whose verbal slips have driven his approval rating below 20% and prompted some LDP leaders to plot his replacement. Opinion polls last week suggested an easy win, but the LDP had to wait until the final dozen results before it reached the modest 229-vote target it had set itself in the 480-seat lower house of parliament. A tense Mr Mori said on television that it was too early to make a judgment on whether he should stand down, although the victory will probably ensure that he can stay in place at least long enough to host next month's G8 summit in Okinawa. \"If there is criticism from within the party about this result, I will accept that and make a final decision about my future,\" he said. The prime minister has looked shaky since he took over the reins of power from Keizo Obuchi, who suffered a fatal stroke on April 2. His verbal gaffes have undermined much of the sympathy vote that the LDP expected to attract from Mr Obuchi's death. Mr Mori kicked off his campaign in the worst possible way by declaring that \"Japan is a divine nation with the emperor at its core\", a comment that critics said was an echo of the emperor-worship ping Shinto creed of the pre-war military regime. Last week he attracted fresh criticism by admitting that he had played a key role at the wedding of a former mobster's family. He then sparked off a furore by suggesting that floating voters - estimated to be about half the electorate - should stay in bed on polling day. Such comments have distracted attention from a long-awaited improvement in the economy. The government confirmed this month that Japan had finally emerged from its worst recession since the second world war, albeit with a tiny growth rate of 0.5% and one of the biggest public debts in its history. During the election campaign Mr Mori promised to keep spending taxpayers' money until the growth rate passed 2%, which is not expected for at least a year. The government has already pumped billions of yen into the economy to lift Japan out of the two-year slump. Much of this has gone on public works in rural areas, ensuring the support yesterday of the LDP's two biggest sources of votes: the construction industry and farmers. The opposition DPJ promised to raise taxes and cut spending. Despite this prudent, but politically damaging, platform, the party made gains, mainly in urban areas It was expected to win about 130 seats, a solid improvement on its pre-election strength of 95. \"We have won the trust of voters because we were honest in our campaign. We are prescribing bitter medicine, not sweet talk,\" its leader, Yukio Hatoyama, said. Only 63% of the 101m eligible voters bothered to go to the polls, the second lowest turnout, after the 1996 general election. This apathy reflected the dreary weather - most voters had to brave downpours - and the even drearier state of national politics. Almost 50 years of virtually continuous one-party rule and the perception that the prime minister is a figurehead rather than a leader disillusioned many. Mr Mori's two coalition partners also suffered a setback. New Komei, which is backed by the Soka Gakkai lay Buddhist group, lost about a quarter of its 42 seats yesterday and the number of New Conservative party MPs fell from 20 to single figures. Foot in his mouth Yoshiro Mori's spate of slip-ups during the campaign sent his approval rating below 20%. 'Japan is a divine nation with the emperor at its core' Critics said this expression, used during a speech to a Shinto group, harked back to the pre-war belief that the emperor was a god. 'We must protect the national polity from the communists' 'Kokutai' (national polity) is another pre-war expression. It referred to Japan's unique emperor-centred political system. 'Undecided voters should stay in bed on polling day' Mori's democratic credentials were called into question after this gaffe - a sign of his fear that non-aligned voters could cause an upset. 'Yes, I was a go-between, but I didn't know the man's background' Mori admits playing a key role at the wedding of a former gangster's son. 'My condolences to the souls of dead soldiers' In a ceremony to mark the 55th anniversary of the Battle of Okinawa, Mori upset his hosts by mentioning only the military sacrifices and forgetting the 120,000 civilians who died in the fighting.",

No doubt, he is wondering why he didn't stick with making stars out of people such as Chris Rea - and avoid ever getting mixed up in this brutal business of politics. His claims of no wrong-doing are falling on deaf ears because that's not the point. He may be technically, legally, entirely in the clear but London mansions, Bentleys - and a \u00a35,000 tax bill - just doesn't look good. And since politics has become largely about image, then how something looks is critical. And this looks like a glimpse into that cosy world in which wealth, privilege and power work the system to their own and each other's benefit.</p> <p>The problem is Lord Levy's tiny tax bill falls neatly into a narrative which is gaining an obsessive grip on the chattering classes: a crisis of political legitimacy. David Lammy's \"victory\" in Tottenham's byelection last week, when only 25% of voters bothered to turn out, is one more example to add to the mounting pile of evidence. If people don't vote, what kind of legitimacy does the winning MP, or government have? Even worse, when a local council organises an innovative idea like a referendum on GM crops, a subject believed to arouse great passions in consumers, and only 14% voted, the whole exercise is rendered meaningless.</p> <p>Lots of books have been published, and more are due, agonising over this ebbing of trust in political institutions, and what kind of democracy we will be left with in a couple of decades. Disaffected Democracies: What's Troubling the Trilateral Countries? edited by Susan Pharr and Robert Putnam, is one such study. It charts the nosedive between the mid-60s and mid-90s in public respect and faith in politics in almost all western democracies (only countries such as the Netherlands and Iceland manage to buck the trend).</p> <p>The editors sensibly point out that this does not mark the death of democracy, because faith in it as the best form of government remains high. It is just that we don't have very high expectations of it any more - either in the honesty of its participants, or its capacity to promote our interests.

      "bodyText": "Lord Levy must have had a horrible weekend. No doubt, he is wondering why he didn't stick with making stars out of people such as Chris Rea - and avoid ever getting mixed up in this brutal business of politics. His claims of no wrong-doing are falling on deaf ears because that's not the point. He may be technically, legally, entirely in the clear but London mansions, Bentleys - and a \u00a35,000 tax bill - just doesn't look good. And since politics has become largely about image, then how something looks is critical. And this looks like a glimpse into that cosy world in which wealth, privilege and power work the system to their own and each other's benefit. The problem is Lord Levy's tiny tax bill falls neatly into a narrative which is gaining an obsessive grip on the chattering classes: a crisis of political legitimacy. David Lammy's \"victory\" in Tottenham's byelection last week, when only 25% of voters bothered to turn out, is one more example to add to the mounting pile of evidence. If people don't vote, what kind of legitimacy does the winning MP, or government have? Even worse, when a local council organises an innovative idea like a referendum on GM crops, a subject believed to arouse great passions in consumers, and only 14% voted, the whole exercise is rendered meaningless. Lots of books have been published, and more are due, agonising over this ebbing of trust in political institutions, and what kind of democracy we will be left with in a couple of decades. Disaffected Democracies: What's Troubling the Trilateral Countries? edited by Susan Pharr and Robert Putnam, is one such study. It charts the nosedive between the mid-60s and mid-90s in public respect and faith in politics in almost all western democracies (only countries such as the Netherlands and Iceland manage to buck the trend). The editors sensibly point out that this does not mark the death of democracy, because faith in it as the best form of government remains high. It is just that we don't have very high expectations of it any more - either in the honesty of its participants, or its capacity to promote our interests. We all now agree with Winston Churchill's adage: democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others. But there are lots of people who for different reasons don't think passive support is good enough. The government for a start.

He suspected he was not on the guest list to offer his views on business regulations but rather for the size of the cheque he might make out to Labour.</p> <p>\"Most people only get invited to those things if it is thought they will give a donation,\" admitted a Labour business adviser. \"It's all very subtle and it's not so subtle, if you know what I mean.\"</p> <p>The crunch call follows the intimate and genial evening, when Millbank moves in for its money and Lord Levy is already after his next target.</p> <p>\"He can be very charming when he is trying to get money out of people - but equally he can be quite vicious,\" said the adviser. \"I would not want to cross him.\"</p> <p>With his even tan, mane of silver hair, firm handshake and fixed smile, and the ear of the prime minister, Lord Levy is prominent among \"Tony's cronies\".</p> <p>The prime minister's millionaire tennis partner is a spectacularly successful fundraiser and personal peace envoy to the Middle East. Ennobled in 1997 by a grateful Mr Blair, his address book has helped raise an estimated \u00a37m for Labour's election victory.</p> <p>Much of the cash was channelled through the then leader of the opposition's blind trust. Lord Levy remains an active fundraiser for the people's party.</p> <p>A secretive sort who normally shuns the spotlight, Lord Levy will hate the embarrassing publicity triggered by yesterday's disclosure that he paid only \u00a35,000 in taxes for 1998/99.</p> <p>The 55-year-old music industry impresario drives a Bentley, and the grounds of his large north London home boast a pool, palm trees and tennis court.</p> <p>He collected \u00a34.25m last year by selling an eight-bedroom house in Tel Aviv, buying a more modest second home after scrapping plans to emigrate to Israel.</p> <p>Lord Levy yesterday denied allegations that he had salted cash away in an offshore trust to beat the taxman, admitting only an overseas Israeli bank account (declaring the \u00a3150 interest on his tax return) to pay bills in that country.</p> <p>During the 1998/99 financial year, the peer emphasised, he devoted himself to voluntary work, living off the capital from selling a music business.</p> <p><b> Shouter</b><br></p> <p>But how did he get by on around \u00a320,000? \"He does not live a five-star lifestyle,\" said a senior Labour figure.</p> <p>Known as a \"bit of a shouter\" who can be abrasive with his staff, legend also has it that while he persuades others to finance Labour he keeps his own hand in his pocket.</p> <p>Lord Levy was a key figure in persuading Bernie Ecclestone to hand over the ill-starred \u00a31m returned by Labour after the motor racing mogul's No 10 talks with Mr Blair were disclosed shortly after the election. Along with the three trustees of Mr Blair's blind trust - one of whom, Lady Jay, yesterday mounted a staunch defence of Lord Levy - he knows where Labour's financial bodies are buried.</p> <p>As controversial as his low taxes has been Lord Levy's unusual role as Mr Blair's US-style emissary to the Middle East. Since April last year the unelected peer, who has no formal Foreign Office role, has visited eight states: Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, Syria and Israel.</p> <p>When an RAF plane landed at Damascus airport just before midnight earlier this month for the funeral of Syria's president Hafez al-Assad, it carried two representatives of the British government. One was Robin Cook, the foreign secretary; the other was Lord Levy.</p> <p>Mr Cook is Britain's official representative for foreign affairs, Lord Levy the unofficial go-between. While Mr Cook acts solely for Britain, the peer also works for Ehud Barak, the Israeli prime minister. Questions are being asked about whether it is right that someone can in effect buy their way into international diplomacy.</p> <p>Sources in Whitehall and Damascus maintain he plays a useful role, his shuttle diplomacy helping bring Syria and Israel together in January for peace talks in Shepherdstown, West Virginia. Yet Lord Levy remains sensitive about domestic criticism of his role. A friend of the peer maintains that his value to Mr Blair is because the prime minister sees him as \"someone he could confide in, an objective voice\" rather than a fundraiser.</p> <p>Making his way to the top from a relatively poor background in Hackney, east London, Lord Levy is proud of his title, although he rarely attends debates in the second chamber.</p> <p>Asked yesterday how one so rich could pay so little in tax, he pointed out that his family's flat did not have a bathroom until he was nine.</p> <p>Leaving school at 16, Lord Levy qualified as an accountant before moving into the music industry to give us Alvin Stardust, Chris Rea and Bad Manners. He made around \u00a310m when he sold Magnet Records in 1983 and set up M&amp;G Records, sold in 1997 for another considerable sum.</p> <p><b> Hostile</b><br></p> <p>He is one of the country's most prominent Jews, giving up the record business to devote himself to raising money for Jewish charities.He is patron or a post holder with 21 charities and trusts, and his support benefits cancer, community and music organisations.</p> <p>The Foreign Office was initially hostile to Lord Levy's freelance activities, unhappy to see Downing Street pursuing an independent line. Some ambassadors were rash enough to be dismissive of him when he turned up at their embassies. None makes that mistake now: they all know that he is Downing Street's man.</p> <p>There are repeated reports that Mr Cook and Lord Levy have a poor relationship, so much so that when the two turned up together in a limousine a diplomat asked: \"Are they talking?\"</p> <p>Those who know the duo best, however, insist that the relationship is good. Lord Levy and his wife, Gilda, are frequently entertained at Chevening by Mr Cook and his wife, Gaynor.</p> <p>Peter Hain, a Foreign Office minister, defended the peer. \"He is giving up a lot of his energy and personal resources to help the peace process,\" said Mr Cook's deputy. \"That deserves plaudits, not criticism.\"</p>",

He suspected he was not on the guest list to offer his views on business regulations but rather for the size of the cheque he might make out to Labour. \"Most people only get invited to those things if it is thought they will give a donation,\" admitted a Labour business adviser. \"It's all very subtle and it's not so subtle, if you know what I mean.\" The crunch call follows the intimate and genial evening, when Millbank moves in for its money and Lord Levy is already after his next target. \"He can be very charming when he is trying to get money out of people - but equally he can be quite vicious,\" said the adviser. \"I would not want to cross him.\" With his even tan, mane of silver hair, firm handshake and fixed smile, and the ear of the prime minister, Lord Levy is prominent among \"Tony's cronies\". The prime minister's millionaire tennis partner is a spectacularly successful fundraiser and personal peace envoy to the Middle East. Ennobled in 1997 by a grateful Mr Blair, his address book has helped raise an estimated \u00a37m for Labour's election victory. Much of the cash was channelled through the then leader of the opposition's blind trust. Lord Levy remains an active fundraiser for the people's party. A secretive sort who normally shuns the spotlight, Lord Levy will hate the embarrassing publicity triggered by yesterday's disclosure that he paid only \u00a35,000 in taxes for 1998/99. The 55-year-old music industry impresario drives a Bentley, and the grounds of his large north London home boast a pool, palm trees and tennis court. He collected \u00a34.25m last year by selling an eight-bedroom house in Tel Aviv, buying a more modest second home after scrapping plans to emigrate to Israel. Lord Levy yesterday denied allegations that he had salted cash away in an offshore trust to beat the taxman, admitting only an overseas Israeli bank account (declaring the \u00a3150 interest on his tax return) to pay bills in that country. During the 1998/99 financial year, the peer emphasised, he devoted himself to voluntary work, living off the capital from selling a music business. Shouter But how did he get by on around \u00a320,000? \"He does not live a five-star lifestyle,\" said a senior Labour figure. Known as a \"bit of a shouter\" who can be abrasive with his staff, legend also has it that while he persuades others to finance Labour he keeps his own hand in his pocket. Lord Levy was a key figure in persuading Bernie Ecclestone to hand over the ill-starred \u00a31m returned by Labour after the motor racing mogul's No 10 talks with Mr Blair were disclosed shortly after the election. Along with the three trustees of Mr Blair's blind trust - one of whom, Lady Jay, yesterday mounted a staunch defence of Lord Levy - he knows where Labour's financial bodies are buried. As controversial as his low taxes has been Lord Levy's unusual role as Mr Blair's US-style emissary to the Middle East. Since April last year the unelected peer, who has no formal Foreign Office role, has visited eight states: Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, Syria and Israel. When an RAF plane landed at Damascus airport just before midnight earlier this month for the funeral of Syria's president Hafez al-Assad, it carried two representatives of the British government. One was Robin Cook, the foreign secretary; the other was Lord Levy. Mr Cook is Britain's official representative for foreign affairs, Lord Levy the unofficial go-between. While Mr Cook acts solely for Britain, the peer also works for Ehud Barak, the Israeli prime minister. Questions are being asked about whether it is right that someone can in effect buy their way into international diplomacy. Sources in Whitehall and Damascus maintain he plays a useful role, his shuttle diplomacy helping bring Syria and Israel together in January for peace talks in Shepherdstown, West Virginia. Yet Lord Levy remains sensitive about domestic criticism of his role. A friend of the peer maintains that his value to Mr Blair is because the prime minister sees him as \"someone he could confide in, an objective voice\" rather than a fundraiser. Making his way to the top from a relatively poor background in Hackney, east London, Lord Levy is proud of his title, although he rarely attends debates in the second chamber. Asked yesterday how one so rich could pay so little in tax, he pointed out that his family's flat did not have a bathroom until he was nine. Leaving school at 16, Lord Levy qualified as an accountant before moving into the music industry to give us Alvin Stardust, Chris Rea and Bad Manners. He made around \u00a310m when he sold Magnet Records in 1983 and set up M&amp;G Records, sold in 1997 for another considerable sum. Hostile He is one of the country's most prominent Jews, giving up the record business to devote himself to raising money for Jewish charities.He is patron or a post holder with 21 charities and trusts, and his support benefits cancer, community and music organisations. The Foreign Office was initially hostile to Lord Levy's freelance activities, unhappy to see Downing Street pursuing an independent line. Some ambassadors were rash enough to be dismissive of him when he turned up at their embassies. None makes that mistake now: they all know that he is Downing Street's man. There are repeated reports that Mr Cook and Lord Levy have a poor relationship, so much so that when the two turned up together in a limousine a diplomat asked: \"Are they talking?\" Those who know the duo best, however, insist that the relationship is good. Lord Levy and his wife, Gilda, are frequently entertained at Chevening by Mr Cook and his wife, Gaynor. Peter Hain, a Foreign Office minister, defended the peer. \"He is giving up a lot of his energy and personal resources to help the peace process,\" said Mr Cook's deputy. \"That deserves plaudits, not criticism.\"",

      "body": "<p>It takes the death of 58 men and women in an airtight trailer in Dover to bring home the reality of what it is to be an asylum seeker in the 21st century. Far from \"sponging off the state\", the life of an economic migrant is fraught with risk and can end in a container that becomes a tomb. </p> <p>Treating this tragedy as a law and order matter misses the point, because it fails to distinguish between symptom and cause. The conventional wisdom is that governments need to take tougher action against criminal gangs who, for a fee of \u00a310,000 per head, promise that they can smuggle people into the west. </p> <p>Actually, this case says more about the perils of globalisation than it does about the failings of governments to stamp out crime, highlighting that the liberalisation of capital markets has been accompanied by ever tighter controls on free movement of labour. </p> <p>Until the debacle in Seattle last December, it was assumed that what was good for Bill Gates and Monsanto was good for everyone. Governments are no longer quite so confident that they are carrying their electorates with them and have been forced to reassess not just what globalisation is, but how it can be shaped to maximise economic welfare. </p> <p><strong> No virgin territory</strong><br> </p> <p>Britain's contribution to the debate will be a white paper being prepared by international development secretary Clare Short and due to be published this autumn. A gathering last week discussed how globalisation compared with the previous epoch of economic liberalism in the two decades before the Great War, and what could be done to make globalisation work for the world's poor. </p> <p>One big difference between now and 100 years ago is that economic migrants from Europe were encouraged to start new lives in the US, southern Africa, Australasia and Latin America. The dislocation and the misery of mass migration should not be minimised, but labour mobility was a shock absorber that gave the international system stability. Today, there is no virgin territory left and governments are wary about granting rights to citizenship now that welfare states are far more wide-ranging than before 1900.</p> <p>In years to come this approach will look increasingly short-sighted as falling birth rates and the ageing of the baby boomer generation leads to a shortage of prime-age workers in the west. Had they settled in Britain, the 54 men and four women would almost certainly have added to the economy by finding work and paying taxes. As far as the government is concerned, there are lessons to be learned from what went before. The first, which perhaps has to be emphasised after Seattle, is that there really is not any alternative to a market-based economic system. </p> <p>Lots of the hardline, anti-globalisation protesters are good at saying what they don't like, not so adept at what they envisage once capitalism has been smashed and the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the World Trade Organisation have been reduced to rubble. What it would actually mean is lives that would be - as Hobbes put it - nasty, brutish and short. However, letting markets rip is equally daft. The story of the period 1850 to 1950 is of governments exploring ways of shaping, managing, directing and controlling markets to spread the benefits of growth and to ensure that the risks of economic failure did not all fall on the poorest and weakest. </p> <p>Progressive taxation, welfare states, health and safety regulations, anti-trust laws, state ownership of key industries were all born out of the sense that wider democracy and ever-greater inequality of income were incompatible. With the gap between rich and poor today widening all the time, the challenges that faced reformers from Shaftesbury to Keynes now face policymakers.</p> <p>How can a market system - which operates globally as well as nationally - be governed to maximise economic and social welfare? As was said at Ms Short's seminar, the task is much harder than a century ago because nation states exercised more control over their own markets than they now do over global ones. </p> <p>That is one reason why the good side of internationalism - the spread of ideas, technology transfer, lower costs to consumers - has been accompanied by a dark side - money laundering, drug smuggling, trafficking in prostitution, financial instability. So unless some action is taken to shape globalisation the world will become an even more dangerous and volatile place. </p> <p>So the third and final lesson for the government is to ignore those who say that the discredited policies of the 1980s and 1990s can do the trick, and that a system of global trickledown will work for rich and poor. This is like people in mid-Victorian Britain trying to pretend that a limited franchise, the defence of property rights and regular crackdowns by the militia would keep the industrial proletariat under control. In fact, it soon became obvious that the alternative to reform was revolution. </p> <p><strong> Pitifully slow progress</strong><br> </p> <p>Likewise, it may be tempting for governments in rich, western nations to believe that all will be well - provided the global marketplace is only lightly regulated and poor countries fast-track liberalisation policies. But this would be a mistake. Today the United Nations meets in Geneva to assess progress towards meeting the 2015 development targets set in Copenhagen five years ago. </p> <p>On each of the three main counts - income poverty, child mortality and universal primary education - results have been pitifully slow and targets will not be met unless governments take more decisive action. There is less unanimity, however, on what should be done. World Bank economists David Dollar and Aart Kraay argue that the main driving force for eliminating poverty is growth, and that there is no real evidence that redistribution has much of an impact. Growth is neutral in its distributional effects, with a 5% increase leading to a 5% increase in incomes for the poor. The trickledown brigade cite this as evidence that those who support managed markets and redistribution are utterly misguided. </p> <p>But if growth is all you need, and the invisible hand of the market will do the rest, why did poverty in Britain soar in the 1980s and 1990s when liberalisation was all the rage? Why have the past 10 years seen so many financial crises, resulting in governments pursuing anti-growth policies - higher interest rates and fiscal retrenchment - to prevent hot money leaving their shores? </p> <p>Of course, growth is necessary to lift people out of poverty, but strategies that fail to recognise the need to tackle inequality are actually anti-growth, resulting in the waste of productive potential. As Oxfam's Kevin Watkins puts it: \"Highly unequal countries are bad at converting growth into poverty reduction because they have to grow faster than more equal countries to achieve the same level of income gain for the poor.\" East Asia, where policymakers have pursued egalitarian economic policies, has been far more successful in eradicating poverty than Latin America, where there has been less emphasis on equity. </p> <p>The events since the devaluation of the Thai baht three years ago this week should act as a wake-up call for governments. We have been living through the first crisis of globalisation, and there is a need for policies to increase the flow of aid, reduce developing country debt, open up protected markets to goods from poor countries and manage capital flows to minimise financial disruption. </p> <p>Governments should ask not whether they can risk trying to shape and manage global markets, but whether they can risk not doing so.</p> <p><a href=\"larry.elliott@theguardian.com\">larry.elliott@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Treating this tragedy as a law and order matter misses the point, because it fails to distinguish between symptom and cause. The conventional wisdom is that governments need to take tougher action against criminal gangs who, for a fee of \u00a310,000 per head, promise that they can smuggle people into the west. Actually, this case says more about the perils of globalisation than it does about the failings of governments to stamp out crime, highlighting that the liberalisation of capital markets has been accompanied by ever tighter controls on free movement of labour. Until the debacle in Seattle last December, it was assumed that what was good for Bill Gates and Monsanto was good for everyone. Governments are no longer quite so confident that they are carrying their electorates with them and have been forced to reassess not just what globalisation is, but how it can be shaped to maximise economic welfare. No virgin territory Britain's contribution to the debate will be a white paper being prepared by international development secretary Clare Short and due to be published this autumn. A gathering last week discussed how globalisation compared with the previous epoch of economic liberalism in the two decades before the Great War, and what could be done to make globalisation work for the world's poor. One big difference between now and 100 years ago is that economic migrants from Europe were encouraged to start new lives in the US, southern Africa, Australasia and Latin America. The dislocation and the misery of mass migration should not be minimised, but labour mobility was a shock absorber that gave the international system stability. Today, there is no virgin territory left and governments are wary about granting rights to citizenship now that welfare states are far more wide-ranging than before 1900. In years to come this approach will look increasingly short-sighted as falling birth rates and the ageing of the baby boomer generation leads to a shortage of prime-age workers in the west. Had they settled in Britain, the 54 men and four women would almost certainly have added to the economy by finding work and paying taxes. As far as the government is concerned, there are lessons to be learned from what went before. The first, which perhaps has to be emphasised after Seattle, is that there really is not any alternative to a market-based economic system. Lots of the hardline, anti-globalisation protesters are good at saying what they don't like, not so adept at what they envisage once capitalism has been smashed and the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the World Trade Organisation have been reduced to rubble. What it would actually mean is lives that would be - as Hobbes put it - nasty, brutish and short. However, letting markets rip is equally daft. The story of the period 1850 to 1950 is of governments exploring ways of shaping, managing, directing and controlling markets to spread the benefits of growth and to ensure that the risks of economic failure did not all fall on the poorest and weakest. Progressive taxation, welfare states, health and safety regulations, anti-trust laws, state ownership of key industries were all born out of the sense that wider democracy and ever-greater inequality of income were incompatible. With the gap between rich and poor today widening all the time, the challenges that faced reformers from Shaftesbury to Keynes now face policymakers. How can a market system - which operates globally as well as nationally - be governed to maximise economic and social welfare? As was said at Ms Short's seminar, the task is much harder than a century ago because nation states exercised more control over their own markets than they now do over global ones. That is one reason why the good side of internationalism - the spread of ideas, technology transfer, lower costs to consumers - has been accompanied by a dark side - money laundering, drug smuggling, trafficking in prostitution, financial instability. So unless some action is taken to shape globalisation the world will become an even more dangerous and volatile place. So the third and final lesson for the government is to ignore those who say that the discredited policies of the 1980s and 1990s can do the trick, and that a system of global trickledown will work for rich and poor. This is like people in mid-Victorian Britain trying to pretend that a limited franchise, the defence of property rights and regular crackdowns by the militia would keep the industrial proletariat under control. In fact, it soon became obvious that the alternative to reform was revolution. Pitifully slow progress Likewise, it may be tempting for governments in rich, western nations to believe that all will be well - provided the global marketplace is only lightly regulated and poor countries fast-track liberalisation policies. But this would be a mistake. Today the United Nations meets in Geneva to assess progress towards meeting the 2015 development targets set in Copenhagen five years ago. On each of the three main counts - income poverty, child mortality and universal primary education - results have been pitifully slow and targets will not be met unless governments take more decisive action. There is less unanimity, however, on what should be done. World Bank economists David Dollar and Aart Kraay argue that the main driving force for eliminating poverty is growth, and that there is no real evidence that redistribution has much of an impact. Growth is neutral in its distributional effects, with a 5% increase leading to a 5% increase in incomes for the poor. The trickledown brigade cite this as evidence that those who support managed markets and redistribution are utterly misguided. But if growth is all you need, and the invisible hand of the market will do the rest, why did poverty in Britain soar in the 1980s and 1990s when liberalisation was all the rage? Why have the past 10 years seen so many financial crises, resulting in governments pursuing anti-growth policies - higher interest rates and fiscal retrenchment - to prevent hot money leaving their shores? Of course, growth is necessary to lift people out of poverty, but strategies that fail to recognise the need to tackle inequality are actually anti-growth, resulting in the waste of productive potential. As Oxfam's Kevin Watkins puts it: \"Highly unequal countries are bad at converting growth into poverty reduction because they have to grow faster than more equal countries to achieve the same level of income gain for the poor.\" East Asia, where policymakers have pursued egalitarian economic policies, has been far more successful in eradicating poverty than Latin America, where there has been less emphasis on equity. The events since the devaluation of the Thai baht three years ago this week should act as a wake-up call for governments. We have been living through the first crisis of globalisation, and there is a need for policies to increase the flow of aid, reduce developing country debt, open up protected markets to goods from poor countries and manage capital flows to minimise financial disruption. Governments should ask not whether they can risk trying to shape and manage global markets, but whether they can risk not doing so. larry.elliott@theguardian.com",

Surely only the Tories could draw pleasure from the case of a millionaire Labour peer exposed for having paid just \u00a35,000 in taxes to the inland revenue last year. For them the delight is obvious: they have already begun to use Lord Levy the way they used the tangled business affairs of the former Treasury minister, Geoffrey Robinson - as evidence of Labour hypocrisy. This is the government, cry the Conservatives, which is happy to slap taxes on all of us - only to keep their own money to themselves. In the time-honoured, crowd-pleasing slogan: \"It's one rule for us, another rule for them.\"</p> <p>The specifics are even more prickly for Labour. The party condemned tax avoidance schemes in opposition, yet now it faces the charge that its richest supporters have somehow found ways to keep their own tax bills down to the bare minimum. For that reason, there will be no smiles on Labour faces at this twist of events. The party did so well by identifying the last government with sleaze that it has created an extra-high standard for itself to be judged by: Labour has to be whiter than white. Luckily, not even Lord Levy's accusers suggest he did anything illegal or even improper to get his tax bill down to pocket change levels. We should be clear: this is not sleaze in the Tory sense of the word. But any financial question mark over Labour is damaging, including this one.</p> <p>The millionaire himself is bound to be the most cheerless of all this morning. He will be embarrassed to have had his financial arrangements laid out for all to see, humiliated to have to go on the radio to protest that he grew up in a flat with no inside WC. As it turns out, he defended himself quite ably yesterday: he said that he paid such low taxes because he didn't earn any money last year. He'd invested all his cash in property, which pays no interest. Lord Levy may also be helped by speculation that his tax returns were somehow eased into public view by those hostile to his efforts at mediation in the Middle East: they may be hoping that a tainted Lord Levy will be less effective as the prime minister's personal envoy to the region. In a perverse way, that is a compliment to his efforts.</p> <p>Still, despite all the aggravation this expose will have brought Lord Levy and the government, all friends of democracy and an open society have cause for celebration in this episode. It is not the conduct of the Labour peer we should applaud - but rather the actions of the High Court judge who brought it to light. At midnight on Friday, Mr Justice Coulson issued what could well be a ground-breaking ruling. Lord Levy had sought to gag the Sunday Times, which had obtained his tax records, but the judge found in favour of the paper. \"He who actively involves himself in public life, as Lord Levy has, cannot altogether complain if he is caught by the heat,\" he said.</p> <p>Let those words be emblazoned in bold type in every newsroom in the land. For they amount to a statement of a concept that British law so sorely lacks: a public interest defence. Ever since the landmark Sullivan ruling of 1964, the US has been clear that a free press has a right and even a duty to report on matters of public import. No such right has existed in British law. Yet Mr Justice Toulson effectively bowed to that concept in his judgment. He said that if Lord Levy had been a purely private citizen, his right to confidentiality would have been paramount. But as a Labour eminence, his conduct was \"a matter of legitimate public reporting\".</p> <p>That view is precisely our own. We have long advocated a proper respect for the privacy of individuals where there is no public interest - to be balanced by a legally enshrined right to report on the publicly-relevant conduct of public figures. This is just such a case and we applaud Mr Justice Toulson for seeing it.</p>",

He'd invested all his cash in property, which pays no interest. Lord Levy may also be helped by speculation that his tax returns were somehow eased into public view by those hostile to his efforts at mediation in the Middle East: they may be hoping that a tainted Lord Levy will be less effective as the prime minister's personal envoy to the region. In a perverse way, that is a compliment to his efforts. Still, despite all the aggravation this expose will have brought Lord Levy and the government, all friends of democracy and an open society have cause for celebration in this episode. It is not the conduct of the Labour peer we should applaud - but rather the actions of the High Court judge who brought it to light. At midnight on Friday, Mr Justice Coulson issued what could well be a ground-breaking ruling. Lord Levy had sought to gag the Sunday Times, which had obtained his tax records, but the judge found in favour of the paper. \"He who actively involves himself in public life, as Lord Levy has, cannot altogether complain if he is caught by the heat,\" he said. Let those words be emblazoned in bold type in every newsroom in the land. For they amount to a statement of a concept that British law so sorely lacks: a public interest defence. Ever since the landmark Sullivan ruling of 1964, the US has been clear that a free press has a right and even a duty to report on matters of public import. No such right has existed in British law. Yet Mr Justice Toulson effectively bowed to that concept in his judgment. He said that if Lord Levy had been a purely private citizen, his right to confidentiality would have been paramount. But as a Labour eminence, his conduct was \"a matter of legitimate public reporting\". That view is precisely our own. We have long advocated a proper respect for the privacy of individuals where there is no public interest - to be balanced by a legally enshrined right to report on the publicly-relevant conduct of public figures. This is just such a case and we applaud Mr Justice Toulson for seeing it.",

The revelation that dome staff are to receive performance-related bonus payments - with the four board directors, including the ousted chief executive Jennie Page, eligible to share up to \u00a3500,000 - came as ministers announced that the future of the dome is to be decided in a fortnight. The deputy prime minister, John Prescott, will chair a meeting on July 10, also attended by Lord Falconer, min ister with responsibility for the dome, to decide which of the two shortlisted buyers, Legacy plc and Dome Europe, will take over the site with an estimated price tag of \u00a3100m. The government is under pressure to cut the dome losses - now \u00a3110m - after a barrage of criticism over the decision to grant a further \u00a329m to the attraction. A spokesman for the dome - which is expecting its three millionth visitor this week - yesterday dismissed reports that almost \u00a36m had been set aside for bonus payments to staff, but confirmed the figure came to more than \u00a32m. The spokesman said the payouts were retention bonuses to ensure staff would stay to the end of their fixed-term contracts and would be made despite a round of cutbacks, including the axing of \"land trains\" for elderly and disabled people, and a decision to abandon late opening during the summer. The dome's four board directors, including Ms Page, are eligible to share a maximum of \u00a3500,000 in performance-related bonuses, while 350 managers will receive payments based on length of service. The 900 dome \"hosts\" will receive less, around 10% of their salaries, with under \u00a31.25m set aside for them. The spokesman added: \"The figures that have been quoted are ridiculously over-hyped.

You'd know - 19 times out of 20 - what comes next: a cabinet reshuffle. Yet, no - this old dog is neither barking nor biting. Why on earth not?</p> <p>One easy answer. Both Mr Blair and Mr Campbell have let it be known that there will be no ministerial movements this summer. Perhaps you can't take that wholly on trust, since the last time they said there would be a shuffle, there wasn't: but even the gossipmongers believe them and the surface of that Westminster lake is millpond calm. Such odd tranquillity, though, is a condition described, not an explanation offered.</p> <p>The real reasons come in two stages. First, some piecemeal changes - the departing of Dobbo, the resurrection of O'Mandy - have shifted cabinet chairs pretty regularly of late. Hoon takes the Treasury 2 slot as Byers heads Defence and Smith claims Industry? You can hear Dr Gallup's pollsters snoring already. It would be a zero sum game yielding zero benefits.</p> <p>The plain fact - especially now that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland only employ ministers to polish their nails - is that the number of jobs which matter, which impinge on public consciousness, has contracted into immobility. David Blunkett is well dug in, Alan Milburn is still digging. Immediately we're into the second stage. Any pre-election shuffle worth a headline would have to involve Messrs Prescott, Cook, Straw and Brown G. Therefore there can be nothing doing. It is deeply instructive to examine why that should be so.</p> <p>Mr Prescott hasn't flourished in the mega-department where local government, ozone layers and train timetables meet. An impossibly stretched brief - and he'd surely do better in the defined area where his enthusiasm still runs high: transport alone. But restructuring now would be too public a u-turn, particularly if it involved the deputy prime minister. Silence falls.</p> <p>Jack Straw, too, after a start of charmed competence, is beginning to find his house blowing down. You can be a good home secretary for three years or so, but then your luck - in the unluckiest, most impossible office - starts to run out. It would be an act of mercy to rescue him - and such freedom of information as remains. But now the moment of truth approaches.</p> <p>Any proper refettling of this government - either ahead of an election or, much more probably, in victory after it - has to include the chancellor of the exchequer. Unless that piece is in play, the process itself is hobbled. Chancellors - like economic booms - don't last for ever. The Stafford Cripps memorial lecture as delivered by Nigel Lawson. Any chancellor with ambitions of higher office needs, like Jim Callaghan, to keep himself busy in other great departments of state until Downing Street does (or doesn't) fall vacant.</p> <p>But pause for a moment and latch this bit of basic political wisdom into the present tumult which begins to afflict Mr Blair's fortunes. Who's in charge of euro policy? Is it Mr Cook and Mr Byers (with Number 10 egging them on sotto voce) or is it the dominant Brown with his five sacred tests? Tests to be applied when the time is right - which can only be after the election and, on current form, maybe a year or two beyond that? Let's schedule, for the sake of argument, a referendum in 2003, so that the impact of abolishing the franc, mark and peseta in 2002 can be duly assessed.</p> <p>Logical hiatus time. For the current squabbling to make any sort of sense, you have to believe that the chancellor of decision, three years' hence, will be the chancellor we've had for the past three years. In short, to see Gordon Brown as the great unshiftable. The tests, as we know, are really political, not economic. A Chancellor Cook or a Chancellor Byers would surely interpret them differently. Indeed, any new chancellor - say Alistair Darling - would be much more under Downing Street's thumb, since he would only have been appointed in the first place if he'd signed up to Mr Blair's inner strategy. Who knows? Foreign Secretary Brown might have turned turtle inside the FO, too.</p> <p>Which, on examination, is what makes Labour's euro debate so bizarre. It is an exercise in time travel down a narrow tube which shuts out the rest of the political world. It assumes only a once and future Brown, immutable in his hegemony.</p> <p>There are added scenarios, of course: there are always scenarios. One - beloved of Brown supporters - is the sporting retirement of Tony Blair half way through the next parliament to spend more time with his family. But what prime minister, pray, will be able to walk away from the helm in the midst - the very midst - of euro transition turbulence, abdication at a moment of national crisis? You don't cement your place in history thus. Mr Blair will never think that time can be right.</p> <p>And anyway - a proliferation of much more imminent scenarios - there is a general election to win, and win well. A poor result and much reduced majority, for instance, would spread blame far beyond No 10. No recriminations for the chancellor? Hardly. It will be open season for Mr Brown's enemies. Why did he rock the boat so openly? Why did he leave the government stuck in a muddle of euro mumbling which William Hague was able to exploit so ripely? Anyone (attention Mr Cook and Mr Byers) could see that coming. Why were the pensioners alienated in parsimony? Why did the NHS cash come too late to make a difference? What price all the micro-fiddling the voters did not understand? Who needed wobbly interventions on elite this or public school that which merely got the Daily Mail excited?</p> <p>Some of that, to be sure, may be unfair: but fairness has nothing to do with politics. Either Gordon Brown will be an associated villain of the piece - or, in triumph, he'll be so strong as to harden the arteries of the next administration and actively sabotage its coherence and chances of overall success. The first Westminster cry of the day will be: who's in charge?</p> <p>Welcome, then, to July in limbo. The frontbench team you see is the team you'll get. The ructions that ripple just below the icy surface are doomed to go on. The two sides of the debate are frozen in personnel permafrost. But inside cabinet, people matter just as much as policies - and the threat of reshuffling is the boss's only real sanction for order. No shuffles, no sanctions, no possibility - as we see all too plainly - of clear leadership.</p> <p>The dogs who aren't barking this summer will be dogs of war in the end.</p> <p><a href=\"peter.preston@theguardian.com\">peter.preston@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Unless that piece is in play, the process itself is hobbled. Chancellors - like economic booms - don't last for ever. The Stafford Cripps memorial lecture as delivered by Nigel Lawson. Any chancellor with ambitions of higher office needs, like Jim Callaghan, to keep himself busy in other great departments of state until Downing Street does (or doesn't) fall vacant. But pause for a moment and latch this bit of basic political wisdom into the present tumult which begins to afflict Mr Blair's fortunes. Who's in charge of euro policy? Is it Mr Cook and Mr Byers (with Number 10 egging them on sotto voce) or is it the dominant Brown with his five sacred tests? Tests to be applied when the time is right - which can only be after the election and, on current form, maybe a year or two beyond that? Let's schedule, for the sake of argument, a referendum in 2003, so that the impact of abolishing the franc, mark and peseta in 2002 can be duly assessed. Logical hiatus time. For the current squabbling to make any sort of sense, you have to believe that the chancellor of decision, three years' hence, will be the chancellor we've had for the past three years. In short, to see Gordon Brown as the great unshiftable. The tests, as we know, are really political, not economic. A Chancellor Cook or a Chancellor Byers would surely interpret them differently. Indeed, any new chancellor - say Alistair Darling - would be much more under Downing Street's thumb, since he would only have been appointed in the first place if he'd signed up to Mr Blair's inner strategy. Who knows? Foreign Secretary Brown might have turned turtle inside the FO, too. Which, on examination, is what makes Labour's euro debate so bizarre. It is an exercise in time travel down a narrow tube which shuts out the rest of the political world. It assumes only a once and future Brown, immutable in his hegemony. There are added scenarios, of course: there are always scenarios. One - beloved of Brown supporters - is the sporting retirement of Tony Blair half way through the next parliament to spend more time with his family. But what prime minister, pray, will be able to walk away from the helm in the midst - the very midst - of euro transition turbulence, abdication at a moment of national crisis? You don't cement your place in history thus. Mr Blair will never think that time can be right. And anyway - a proliferation of much more imminent scenarios - there is a general election to win, and win well. A poor result and much reduced majority, for instance, would spread blame far beyond No 10. No recriminations for the chancellor? Hardly. It will be open season for Mr Brown's enemies. Why did he rock the boat so openly? Why did he leave the government stuck in a muddle of euro mumbling which William Hague was able to exploit so ripely? Anyone (attention Mr Cook and Mr Byers) could see that coming. Why were the pensioners alienated in parsimony? Why did the NHS cash come too late to make a difference? What price all the micro-fiddling the voters did not understand? Who needed wobbly interventions on elite this or public school that which merely got the Daily Mail excited? Some of that, to be sure, may be unfair: but fairness has nothing to do with politics. Either Gordon Brown will be an associated villain of the piece - or, in triumph, he'll be so strong as to harden the arteries of the next administration and actively sabotage its coherence and chances of overall success. The first Westminster cry of the day will be: who's in charge? Welcome, then, to July in limbo. The frontbench team you see is the team you'll get. The ructions that ripple just below the icy surface are doomed to go on. The two sides of the debate are frozen in personnel permafrost. But inside cabinet, people matter just as much as policies - and the threat of reshuffling is the boss's only real sanction for order. No shuffles, no sanctions, no possibility - as we see all too plainly - of clear leadership. The dogs who aren't barking this summer will be dogs of war in the end. peter.preston@theguardian.com",

Sean's role in Fast Times At Ridgemont High was basically rejigged for Chris by writer Cameron Crowe for this less interesting high school picture. He branched out a bit by appearing in martial arts flick Best Of The Best, then finally got critical acclaim as Nice Guy Eddie in Reservoir Dogs. The tough-guy image stuck, but also spread into his private life - he was recently pictured in the National Enquirer smoking crack in an alley (after which Sean came to the rescue, and Chris entered rehab).

      "bodyText": "Chris Penn in The Wild Life (Art Linson, 1984) Who? Mostly known for being Sean's fatter, younger and less talented sibling, Christopher started as he meant to go on - by doing a sorry impression of his big brother. Sean's role in Fast Times At Ridgemont High was basically rejigged for Chris by writer Cameron Crowe for this less interesting high school picture. He branched out a bit by appearing in martial arts flick Best Of The Best, then finally got critical acclaim as Nice Guy Eddie in Reservoir Dogs. The tough-guy image stuck, but also spread into his private life - he was recently pictured in the National Enquirer smoking crack in an alley (after which Sean came to the rescue, and Chris entered rehab). He's now working with notorious director Abel Ferrara. Is that a good idea, Chris? The role: Tom Drake, knuckleheaded high school wrestler who works in a bowling alley with the preppy Bill (Eric Stoltz). When the two start sharing an apartment, it all goes very, very wrong. Best line: His catch-phrase, which can be applied to any situation, from not being served alcohol to being turned down by a girl: \"It's casual.\" Cringe factor: He probably looks back with regret, but only because he was so much thinner then. Other wannabes: A pre-Ghostbusters Rick Moranis, and a very pre-Twin Peaks Sherilyn Fenn. Critical judgement: Leonard Maltin deemed it an \"unfunny youth comedy,\" and a \"meagre attempt to clone Fast Times At Ridgemont High, with Christopher Penn trying to ape brother Sean's flaky character - unsuccessfully.\" Also not starring in: Teen classic Rumblefish and alongside Tom Cruise in All The Right Moves, both in 1983. The Wild Life, Sky Cinema, Thursday June 29, 10pm &amp; 3.05am.",

This is a milestone in the western scientific quest to understand the workings of our own bodies. We are told that this moment is so significant, it will revolutionise medicine and the treatment of disease - making our efforts until now appear medievally clumsy and crude. But there is also a need to step back from the hyperbole: this may be a crucial development, but its full impact will take a long time to unfold. For a start, although the full map of the human genome will be published on the internet, it will, as one scientist has quipped already, read like Hungarian to most of us. For no one knows the language and no one has the dictionary. It will be many, many years before we have begun to understand what our genes do or the complex way in which they interact to create a living organism - let alone use that knowledge to develop treatments. The promised cures to such illnesses as cystic fibrosis and haemophilia are still some time away.</p> <p>The promise of the human genome project is that it begins to untangle how almost all diseases have some genetic origins. The explanation for why some people develop cancer or malaria while others do not, why some die when some recover, lies partly in our genes. Already we can now glimpse an era of medicine in which all of us have our genome printed on a swipe-card; we will know which diseases we are vulnerable to, and how treatment can be customised to meet exactly our requirements. It opens up the possibility of eliminating certain inherited, genetic diseases, bringing relief to the suffering of families whose lives have been scarred for generations.</p> <p>But we also have to be clear about what the human genome will not tell us. A string of news stories in recent years claiming the \"gene for homosexuality\" or for criminality have conjured up fanciful myths. People have imagined a straight genetic determinism, in which the secrets of human nature are directly foretold by our genes. In this imagining, the human genome is little more than a kind of software programme which explains everything about our personality and our bodies. Such a fantasy is misleading, to say the least. Lest we forget, personality is the product of the complex interaction of our genes and our environment.</p> <p>Along with the hope for medical breakthroughs, the human genome triggers a number of legitimate anxieties, starting with two existing concerns. The first fear is of a kind of eugenics, in which certain forms of disability can be eliminated. The second relates to the response of the life- and medical insurance industry: might they deny or charge extra for cover to those born with \"dodgy\" genes? The former is highly charged with religious belief and emotion; just as we struggle now over the morality of aborting a foetus with Down's Syndrome, so in time we will struggle over a much wider range of inheritable diseases identifiable in foetuses. The second question is one for politicians, whose task it will be to stop the insurance industry and employers engaging in genetic discrimination.</p> <p>A more immediate concern is the danger that a monumental scientific advance could be commercialised. The US geneticist Craig Venter is often cast as the villain of the piece, a flamboyant maverick intent on being the first bio-tech billionaire. To give Mr Venter his due, he has dramatically brought forward this first draft of the human genome by turning the publicly-funded effort into a competitive race. But what irks scientists around the world is that his research remains on a subscription-only basis, supplying rich pharmaceutical and bio-technology companies with the headstart to apply for patents, thus staking out territory to deter other scientists. Of course, patenting is a necessary protection for the financial and intellectual investment made by inventors and scientists. But there are some areas of the law in both the US and Europe which have shown themselves to be dangerously unclear when it comes to this brave new world of genetic information.</p> <p>Beyond these concerns lie much broader questions about who will benefit from this scientific endeavour. A central fear is that the great discoveries we expect the human genome to yield will only exacerbate the (already grotesque) inequalities in health-care across the world. Billions will have been poured into the human genome project. Billions more will be invested in using its results to fight western maladies like heart disease and cancer.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>At the age of 69, Alfred Brendel has discovered Mozart. Which is, to borrow a phrase once used by Brendel himself, \"a statement that looks round for applause\". And one that is only partly true. The pianist has always played the concertos and is especially pleased with his recent recordings with the Scottish Chamber Orchestra. </p> <p>Nevertheless, Brendel is full of the excitement of discovering Mozart's sonatas, which have eluded him for the best part of 60 years. \"This is my Mozart period,\" he says. He pauses. \"There is a very good remark by Artur Schnabel about Mozart's sonatas: 'Too easy for children. Too difficult for artists.' \" He beams an Eric Morecambe beam. </p> <p>We are talking in the library of Brendel's home in Hampstead, directly above the room in which he practises, with its brace of Steinways and collection of Lisztiana, including a death mask that hovers just above his left hand as he plays. He is on a flying visit home. The previous night he was playing in Vienna; that afternoon he is setting off for Stuttgart. It would have been easier to fly direct, but his daughter is sitting her A-levels and he has been persuaded to spend one night in London. I must not come too early - he is practising. And he must be out of the house by three o'clock sharp to make the plane. There is just time to talk. </p> <p>Some soloists relax a little as they approach old age. Brendel is hardly easing up, though it cannot be for want of laurels on which to rest. He still plays around 90 concerts a year - 90 repetitions of the experience he once described as \"the sudden burst of sweat in a spasm of anxiety\". Last year saw him performing in 53 towns and cities from Tokyo to Minnesota, from New York to Plush, Dorset. </p> <p>Eight years ago we could not have had this conversation. It was then that he suffered what he simply refers to as \"a sort of crisis\". \"I had to stop playing because I had pains in my arms and I was not at all sure whether I could continue,\" he recalls in tones that still have a touch of Austrian formality. \"I went to see several doctors, physiotherapists, chiropractors and got more and more desperate because they did not seem to know what they were talking about, until about a year later I found a doctor in Munich who specialises in sports injuries. </p> <p>\"He seems to have helped me. I probably owe him the fact that I am still active and do not feel impeded in what I am doing. But of course I also regulated some of it by changing my repertoire, taking out a few particularly athletic pieces, like the Brahms concertos or the Liszt sonata - pieces I had lived with for a long time. </p> <p>\"I am also playing fewer programmes than before. In my 30s, I think there was one year when I played 13 completely different recital programmes within about 12 months. I am not dreaming of doing that sort of thing again.\" </p> <p>Maybe not 13 recital programmes. But in 1999/2000 he played four different recital programmes, three different Mozart concertos, one Beethoven concerto and Schubert's Winterreise with the young German singer Matthias Goerne. The Hamburg doctor does seem to have done the trick. And if giving up Liszt is partly responsible for leading Brendel to Mozart, who would complain? </p> <p>He explains why he remained aloof from Mozart for so long. \"Mozart's sonatas do not have such a good reputation. People think that, beside the piano concertos and Beethoven's sonatas, they are no great shakes, and I must confess that I myself did underestimate some of them before. Well, I take everything back. </p> <p>\"They are in a way the most difficult pieces to play - quite contrary to what people think. Everything is completely exposed. You are all by yourself. You have very few lines to play. It should be poised and seemingly casual at the same time. This is one of the reasons you'll hear Mozart's sonatas so rarely in recital programmes. </p> <p>\"So I told myself, 'If I don't do it now, then it may be too late.' There is still - at least in some of my recitals - the control that I want to be there, and at least I give it a try. It's never good enough.\" </p> <p>On Wednesday Brendel plays the C minor sonata K457 at London's Royal Festival Hall. That leads him to talk about his perception that Mozart's sonatas are \"not piano works in the narrow sense\". </p> <p>Meaning? \"Most great piano pieces are not conceived precisely in terms of the piano sound. They are put on the piano because one player can master a whole piece without the interference of other players. That is the main reason piano literature is so incomparably rich. </p> <p>\"So for me the C minor sonata is much more an orchestral piece than anything else; within 20 years of Mozart's death there were at least three orchestrations. That doesn't show that it needs the orchestra, but it shows how big in scale it is, and what it contains. The point for me is to make some of these latent possibilities manifest on the piano.\" </p> <p>Even allowing for self-deprecation, a Mozart sonata surely does not present Brendel with great technical problems? \"No,\" he counters. \"People are very wrong when they think that technical difficulties in Mozart are secondary. They are not. They are intimately linked to the psychological under standing of what happens in every single second.\" </p> <p>At this stage of Brendel's life, one senses, he invests more energy in working out every piece second by second - certainly more than he did during his 13-programmes-a-year life. And after the preparation comes the culmination of all that effort. This is Brendel's description of what happens once he is up there on stage - white tie, tails, sweat, anxiety: \"The piece is first, then there is me who tries to transmit it and the public where it should arrive. </p> <p>\"That means that, sitting in the middle, I have to be in contact with both sides and also with myself as I do contradictory things at the same time, like controlling and losing myself. Like anticipating what I should do next and at the same time taking in what I have played and reacting to it.

      "bodyText": "At the age of 69, Alfred Brendel has discovered Mozart. Which is, to borrow a phrase once used by Brendel himself, \"a statement that looks round for applause\". And one that is only partly true. The pianist has always played the concertos and is especially pleased with his recent recordings with the Scottish Chamber Orchestra. Nevertheless, Brendel is full of the excitement of discovering Mozart's sonatas, which have eluded him for the best part of 60 years. \"This is my Mozart period,\" he says. He pauses. \"There is a very good remark by Artur Schnabel about Mozart's sonatas: 'Too easy for children. Too difficult for artists.' \" He beams an Eric Morecambe beam. We are talking in the library of Brendel's home in Hampstead, directly above the room in which he practises, with its brace of Steinways and collection of Lisztiana, including a death mask that hovers just above his left hand as he plays. He is on a flying visit home. The previous night he was playing in Vienna; that afternoon he is setting off for Stuttgart. It would have been easier to fly direct, but his daughter is sitting her A-levels and he has been persuaded to spend one night in London. I must not come too early - he is practising. And he must be out of the house by three o'clock sharp to make the plane. There is just time to talk. Some soloists relax a little as they approach old age. Brendel is hardly easing up, though it cannot be for want of laurels on which to rest. He still plays around 90 concerts a year - 90 repetitions of the experience he once described as \"the sudden burst of sweat in a spasm of anxiety\". Last year saw him performing in 53 towns and cities from Tokyo to Minnesota, from New York to Plush, Dorset. Eight years ago we could not have had this conversation. It was then that he suffered what he simply refers to as \"a sort of crisis\". \"I had to stop playing because I had pains in my arms and I was not at all sure whether I could continue,\" he recalls in tones that still have a touch of Austrian formality. \"I went to see several doctors, physiotherapists, chiropractors and got more and more desperate because they did not seem to know what they were talking about, until about a year later I found a doctor in Munich who specialises in sports injuries. \"He seems to have helped me. I probably owe him the fact that I am still active and do not feel impeded in what I am doing. But of course I also regulated some of it by changing my repertoire, taking out a few particularly athletic pieces, like the Brahms concertos or the Liszt sonata - pieces I had lived with for a long time. \"I am also playing fewer programmes than before. In my 30s, I think there was one year when I played 13 completely different recital programmes within about 12 months. I am not dreaming of doing that sort of thing again.\" Maybe not 13 recital programmes. But in 1999/2000 he played four different recital programmes, three different Mozart concertos, one Beethoven concerto and Schubert's Winterreise with the young German singer Matthias Goerne. The Hamburg doctor does seem to have done the trick. And if giving up Liszt is partly responsible for leading Brendel to Mozart, who would complain? He explains why he remained aloof from Mozart for so long. \"Mozart's sonatas do not have such a good reputation. People think that, beside the piano concertos and Beethoven's sonatas, they are no great shakes, and I must confess that I myself did underestimate some of them before. Well, I take everything back. \"They are in a way the most difficult pieces to play - quite contrary to what people think. Everything is completely exposed. You are all by yourself. You have very few lines to play. It should be poised and seemingly casual at the same time. This is one of the reasons you'll hear Mozart's sonatas so rarely in recital programmes. \"So I told myself, 'If I don't do it now, then it may be too late.' There is still - at least in some of my recitals - the control that I want to be there, and at least I give it a try. It's never good enough.\" On Wednesday Brendel plays the C minor sonata K457 at London's Royal Festival Hall. That leads him to talk about his perception that Mozart's sonatas are \"not piano works in the narrow sense\". Meaning? \"Most great piano pieces are not conceived precisely in terms of the piano sound. They are put on the piano because one player can master a whole piece without the interference of other players. That is the main reason piano literature is so incomparably rich. \"So for me the C minor sonata is much more an orchestral piece than anything else; within 20 years of Mozart's death there were at least three orchestrations. That doesn't show that it needs the orchestra, but it shows how big in scale it is, and what it contains. The point for me is to make some of these latent possibilities manifest on the piano.\" Even allowing for self-deprecation, a Mozart sonata surely does not present Brendel with great technical problems? \"No,\" he counters. \"People are very wrong when they think that technical difficulties in Mozart are secondary. They are not. They are intimately linked to the psychological under standing of what happens in every single second.\" At this stage of Brendel's life, one senses, he invests more energy in working out every piece second by second - certainly more than he did during his 13-programmes-a-year life. And after the preparation comes the culmination of all that effort. This is Brendel's description of what happens once he is up there on stage - white tie, tails, sweat, anxiety: \"The piece is first, then there is me who tries to transmit it and the public where it should arrive. \"That means that, sitting in the middle, I have to be in contact with both sides and also with myself as I do contradictory things at the same time, like controlling and losing myself. Like anticipating what I should do next and at the same time taking in what I have played and reacting to it. Like overlooking the whole piece in the way you overlook a landscape and at the same time unfolding it, giving birth to it, starting from the first note like a new experience. Then there is the contradiction of pleasing yourself as much as possible but also thinking of the person in the 30th row and a way of transmitting something into the distance. This is particularly extreme in the American summer festivals when you play for 5,000 or 10,000 people. You are hardly seen by some of these people, and still something has to come across, if possible.\" Does it become more or less difficult with age? \"I think I can do certain things better, in terms of control of, let us say 'ornaments'. But this is also tied to the mind. One gets more experienced. One knows more precisely what one should do. One has a wider reach of characterisation of pieces. So it becomes at the same time freer and more accurate. Music-making is full of contradictions.

      "body": "<p>\"Architects are doomed to extinction within 15 years.\" So says Ron German, a director of Stanhope plc, a major property development company. It is tempting to dismiss the remark as the barking of some no-nonsense chap with a dislike for the bow-tie-and-funny-glasses brigade after a few G&amp;Ts. But German is no fool. He has been part of a decades-long process in which buildings are increasingly assembled from mass-produced components, much like cars. In the future, he says, the architect's role could be confined to \"tweaking\" components. \"Making things special may be important to architects, but it does not make much difference to occupiers. Standardisation will be vital.\" </p> <p>German was speaking at the annual British Council for Offices conference two weeks ago. Also on the bill was Michael Aukett of Michael Aukett Architects Ltd, who pointed out that his firm's standardised design system for Tesco supermarkets means that the company no longer needs to consult an architect each time it wants a new store. As a result, costs have come down by 32%. </p> <p>German and Aukett's comments should come as no surprise. Just check out all those mass-produced supermarkets fronting Britain's A roads, that prefab litany of warehouses, distribution depots, shopping malls, business parks, sports stadia and executive hotels: an amorphous, anodyne, anonymous collection of sheds. The architectural input seems to be less than zero. Occasionally you'll drive past a shed - it could be Toys \"R\" Us, or Iceland, or Tesco - with some notional architectural input: it amounts to a fancy, tented porch, a split postmodern pediment and a lick of Jim Stirling-style lime green or mauve paint.

      "bodyText": "\"Architects are doomed to extinction within 15 years.\" So says Ron German, a director of Stanhope plc, a major property development company. It is tempting to dismiss the remark as the barking of some no-nonsense chap with a dislike for the bow-tie-and-funny-glasses brigade after a few G&amp;Ts. But German is no fool. He has been part of a decades-long process in which buildings are increasingly assembled from mass-produced components, much like cars. In the future, he says, the architect's role could be confined to \"tweaking\" components. \"Making things special may be important to architects, but it does not make much difference to occupiers. Standardisation will be vital.\" German was speaking at the annual British Council for Offices conference two weeks ago. Also on the bill was Michael Aukett of Michael Aukett Architects Ltd, who pointed out that his firm's standardised design system for Tesco supermarkets means that the company no longer needs to consult an architect each time it wants a new store. As a result, costs have come down by 32%. German and Aukett's comments should come as no surprise. Just check out all those mass-produced supermarkets fronting Britain's A roads, that prefab litany of warehouses, distribution depots, shopping malls, business parks, sports stadia and executive hotels: an amorphous, anodyne, anonymous collection of sheds. The architectural input seems to be less than zero. Occasionally you'll drive past a shed - it could be Toys \"R\" Us, or Iceland, or Tesco - with some notional architectural input: it amounts to a fancy, tented porch, a split postmodern pediment and a lick of Jim Stirling-style lime green or mauve paint. And yet Britain has something like 30,000 architects. What do they do? Few seem to be involved at any great depth in the design of what really matters, such as new housing, even though Britain is being smothered in a feverish rash of the red-brick, three-bedroom stuff.

      "body": "<p>\"Don't look at us. Oh no. She's seen us. Go away. Don't look. Go away.\" Charles Webb, the author of The Graduate, and his ex-wife Fred, the feminist artist, were standing on the corner of a shopping precinct in a backwater on the south coast, scowling at me. \"You can't miss them,\" the woman in the pet shop downstairs had said. \"Couple of oddbods,\" her assistant had added, giggling. Then hissed: \"She wears a scarf.\" </p> <p>It had been intended that I should pick up the key to their flat from under the mat, let myself in, look around a bit, and then meet them an hour later. But I hadn't been able to find their door and then . . . well, there they were. </p> <p>\"Hello!\" I called. </p> <p>\"What kind of a stalker are you?\" growled Webb, a shambling creature in dark glasses and a ponytail. Fred, a dainty figurine in shades of grey, looked like she wanted to cry. \"It's ruined,\" she said. \"It's all ruined.\" </p> <p>They still wanted me to go into their flat. They waited outside while I let myself in. There was a bed in one room, a yoga mat, but no furniture, no television, no food. There were handwritten Post-It notes saying: \"Wash back\", \"Shave\", \"Put drawings away\". The windows were boarded up with corrugated paper. There were animal smells drifting up from downstairs. When I left, Fred said hopefully: \"Did you leave anything behind? A sign that you'd been there? Stalkers usually do.\" </p> <p>They had wanted to know what it felt like to be stalked. They're working on something on the subject. There's a woman in Paris who comes, like Webb, from Pasadena, California, and thinks she knows the real Mrs Robinson. She's got the number of their mobile phone somehow and keeps calling them. She's an osteopath and is coming to an osteopaths convention in Maidstone soon, and wants to meet them there. \"Maid Stone? Do you know Maid Stone?\" asked Webb, for a disconcerting moment The American Tourist. The moment passed. \"We've got very interested in what's behind this mentality,\" he went on. \"It seems sexuality might be the common denominator.\" </p> <p>It is fair to say that Webb and Fred (no surname) are not conventional people. They've been on the run most of their lives. Ever since The Graduate was published in 1963, in fact. The book became a classic, a movie, a soundtrack, and now a play; Benjamin Braddock, its rebellious protagonist, caught forever as icon of dissent, a \"set\" text. Its author, though, has just kept on moving, continuing to shun success, conformity, materialism. There's Benjamin Braddock in the West End taking off Kathleen Turner's clothes. There's the man who created him, in his 60s now, living with no furniture in a rented flat smelling of guinea pigs. \"Nomads, I suppose,\" said Fred. </p> <p>They've lived in England for 12 months now. Before that, they lived all over America, in nudist colonies and campsites and, for five years, in one room in a motel. They taught their children, two boys, at home - \"unschooling\" it's called in the US, even when it was illegal and involved going into hiding. They have few possessions, and give most of their money away. They rejected some inheritances: Webb's father was a wealthy heart surgeon in California; Fred's family used to run Connecticut. Her mother cried when she wouldn't come out at the debutantes ball at the Plaza Hotel in New York. </p> <p>And they got divorced one day, too. \"Irreconcilable differences with the institution of marriage,\" it says on their form. \"My mother was gay,\" said Webb. \"She couldn't be married to the kind of person she would have liked to marry, and it was a sort of protest for that reason. Although,\" he added, \"it was sort of lost on her since she didn't know she was gay.\" Fred, who has also been called Sasha and Anxiety, shaves her head daily. \"It's part of a ritual, sort of, to disengage from material things. I just don't like hair. It is such a bore, you know.\" </p> <p>Their arrival in England a year ago marked the end of their retirement, which they decided to take in the middle of their lives instead of at the end. \"It seemed like another way to approach something that was fairly conventional,\" explained Webb. He was 23 when he wrote The Graduate, and spent the ensuing 38 years trying to escape it. \"Everything he wrote was always compared to it,\" said Fred. So he stopped. Until now. He has just sold his first novel for 25 years, New Cardiff. Illustrated by Fred, who describes herself as a satirical artist, it is about an English painter who takes refuge from a ruined love affair in a small Vermont town. The movie rights are under negotiation. A huge deal is due to be announced. </p> <p>\"You know what?\" said Fred. \"Talk to our agent about that. We've kind of distanced ourselves from the whole selling process.\" She added that, whatever the figure is, they'll give it all away. \"No I don't think so,\" said Webb. \"I don't think we would.\" \"We would,\" she said. \"I would. We have. We always have.\" Later, when we were talking about something else, she turned to him and said: \"I don't know why you say you won't give it all away.\" \"Because we don't plan ahead, that's why,\" he said softly. \"That's true,\" she said, softer still. </p> <p>We had repaired, for the sake of anonymity, to a Harvester's on the nearby ring road for an early lunch. They don't want the locals to know who they are; and they made me promise not to name their town. They did seem a bit hungry. Fred even ate the orange peel that came with her salad. Hungry for conversation, too. It must be lonely being a nomad. They both talked slowly and wonderingly as if the world was still a surprise to them. Fred took the lead, though usually stopped when Webb spoke, smiled at him when he did so. </p> <p>They couldn't believe, they said, when they saw in the paper shortly after they arrived here that The Graduate was coming to the West End (they had no stage rights, they'd sold the movie rights for $18,000). \"I'd said to Charles, 'It's time to graduate from The Graduate and then there it was.'\" They went to visit the cast. All anyone wanted to know was whether it was autobiographical. Was it? \"In terms of milieu and character, yes. Charles is Ben, I'm Elaine, the parents were like that . . .\" But did he have an affair with Mrs Robinson? \"What do you think?\" I said I thought probably not. \"Well, you're right. I think it was a love story based on our feelings for each other.\" (They had met at college.) \"Pretty much,\" agreed Webb. </p> <p>They love being in England which they think is \"pre-corruption\". Even France has let them down on that front. They took a trip recently to the Naked City, the nudist camp which introduced them to the genre, near Marseille in France. \"Now it's just a bunch of obese elderly Germans plodding around in bare feet looking at the girls,\" said Webb. Here, they feel relaxed. Their last calling point was west Hollywood, a gay town, which \"wasn't too bad because people were at odds basically with society\". But, even there, people would ask Fred about her hair all the time. \"I'll tell you something that happened to me every day and I just dreaded it. I'd be standing in the grocery line and it would be, 'Oh, I'm so sorry you've had chemotherapy', or, 'Gee, I love the way you tie your scarves.' They sound nice, but really they're disapproving, calling attention to it, pointing it out. Here not one person has mentioned it.\" </p> <p>\"Over here,\" continued Webb, \"people have feelings for each other in a family. Parents. Fathers. Sons. Mothers.\" Fred picked up the thread. \"Sisters. Brothers. Holding hands, talking.\" \"Grandmothers. Grandchildren,\" said Webb. \"They're having fun together,\" said Fred. \"In the States, you don't see children talking to their parents unless it's, 'Can you give me some money to buy some Reeboks?' In the States, there is a mindset that you hate people over 40.\" Webb: \"In a cold, hostile, cynical way.\" \"Oh golly,\" said Fred. </p> <p>As for their sons, both in their 30s, they've turned out pretty conventional, the children perhaps their grandparents might have wanted. Both took themselves off to college. Webb said: \"They'd had enough of us.\" The eldest is \"very corporate. He's a Russian criminologist. His field is political science and he works for an energy thinktank in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and he tells investors where they should put their money.\" The youngest is more conventional still. \"He is doing a performance art piece,\" said Fred. \"He calls it spending his inheritance.\" \"It's a very long performance,\" added Webb. </p> <p>Later, when I was giving them a lift back to their flat, Fred expressed anxiety about the number of girls that seem to come in and out of her boys' lives. \"There are just so many. You meet one and you think that's the one and then it's a different girl next time.\" You can tell that what she'd really like them to do is settle down. So what about them? When will they be moving on? Webb says they have to go back to the US at some point; there's some furniture in storage to be sorted out, for one thing. \"They're taking $85 a month out of our account over there to store $50 worth of stuff.\" \"We got the furniture free,\" said Fred. \"I thought we ought to have something.\" They're in the process of applying for an artist and writer residency visa which will allow them to work here for three years. </p> <p>Webb was out of earshot when Fred said in a small voice: \"I think Charles'll want to move on, but I want to be here for ever.\" And she shrugged.</p>",

His field is political science and he works for an energy thinktank in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and he tells investors where they should put their money.\" The youngest is more conventional still. \"He is doing a performance art piece,\" said Fred. \"He calls it spending his inheritance.\" \"It's a very long performance,\" added Webb. Later, when I was giving them a lift back to their flat, Fred expressed anxiety about the number of girls that seem to come in and out of her boys' lives. \"There are just so many. You meet one and you think that's the one and then it's a different girl next time.\" You can tell that what she'd really like them to do is settle down. So what about them? When will they be moving on? Webb says they have to go back to the US at some point; there's some furniture in storage to be sorted out, for one thing. \"They're taking $85 a month out of our account over there to store $50 worth of stuff.\" \"We got the furniture free,\" said Fred. \"I thought we ought to have something.\" They're in the process of applying for an artist and writer residency visa which will allow them to work here for three years. Webb was out of earshot when Fred said in a small voice: \"I think Charles'll want to move on, but I want to be here for ever.\" And she shrugged.",

With the annual election for the important post as shop steward for the backbenches not due until November, it is far from clear whether other challengers will now join the contest - or whether anyone can beat the well entrenched Mr Soley. But the decision by the MP for Thurrock to break ranks is a further sign of disquiet in what has been a surprisingly loyal, even docile parliamentary party, in a year which has finally seen the cabinet run into difficulties with both policy and the voters. Mr Soley, a former probation officer, MP for Acton and Shepherd's Bush, is well liked, but has laid himself open to criticism for sometimes seeming to be the government's messenger to the backbenches, not the other way round. His challenger will demand better accountabilty - and more listening - from ministers. Mr Mackinlay, 51, a former local government officer, is a product of the old trade union right wing of the Labour party, but one whose passion for the historic rights of parliament has turned him into one of the most outspoken backbench critics of the Blair government's style. A year after Mr Blair's election, he caught the mood of many MPs when he reminded him how much Labour had loathed what he called \"the fawning, obsequious, soft-ball, well rehearsed planted question\" that John Major had faced from his own side and how some MPs felt it was their duty to challenge ministers \"without fear or favour\".

The propaganda art, depicting jubilant scenes of flag-flying Nazis after Germany's annexation of Austria in 1938, are to be restored and transferred to a museum in the province. The decision has been held up by Mr Haider's allies as proof that the controversial politician, renowned abroad for praising Hitler and hailing SS veterans, has no sympathies with National Socialism. But his opponents have denounced it as a cheap, populist move aimed at appeasing his critics around the world, and have asked why the paintings were allowed to survive for so long in a building meant to embody democratic values. The Carinthian-born artist Switbert Lobisser was commissioned by the Nazi party in 1938 to paint the frescoes to decorate the central chamber of the parliament building. They remained in place when British troops established their base in the building at the end of the war. \"They did not cover them up, which I think is grotesque, but then swastikas were everywhere in Austria at that time,\" the director of the Carinthian Art Gallery in Klagenfurt, Professor Arnulf Rohsmann, said. The new government which moved back into the building in 1948 cursorily whitewashed the frescoes.

Mr Haider, still de facto leader of the Freedom party, even though he has relinquished the formal leadership, and self-appointed chief cultural watchdog of Carinthia, has taken a close interest in the fate of the frescoes. In removing them, he said, the provincial government hoped to \"send out a positive signal to its EU partners\", who imposed sanctions on Austria in protest at his party joining the coalition government. Some say the paintings should be destroyed, others say that would be tantamount to censorship. \"If we destroy the pictures we destroy the past,\" said Wilhelm Wadl, historian at the Carinthian state archives. \"That would be to react the same way the Nazis did.\" In fact the paintings, regarded as \"primitive\" and of negligible importance by art critics but of historical value as pieces of propaganda, are subject to a preservation order and cannot be destroyed.",

      "body": "<p>And now for a bulletin from the Department of the Patently Obvious: psychiatrists have just discovered that women shop too much. And a percentage of them, they say, spend so aggressively and shop so passionately that they are in serious danger of hurting themselves, if not ruining their lives. Death by Prada, anyone?</p> <p>It's easy to make jokes and indeed American women kid themselves about coming down with bouts of \"aspendicitis\". But psychiatrists at Stanford University in California studying shopaholic women say the kind of spending they are tracking is not your standard case of heading out for some retail therapy after a bad day at work. \"These are people who are preoccupied with shopping and buying above everything else,\" says study leader, psychiatrist Dr Lorrin Koran. \"They buy things they don't need, don't use, don't open. Most never take the tags off the clothes. The pleasure for them is in the buying, not the possession.\"</p> <p>In some cases, shopaholics \"black out\" and don't remember their buying binges. When family and friends start to vent about their purchases, they begin hiding the things they buy. Koran says compulsive shoppers, 90% of whom are women, report a release of tension after buying, followed by feelings of guilt, anger and sadness. Many never remove purchases from the packaging; others return them days after a spree. \"We have people in our study who are between $5,000 and $100,000 in debt from compulsive shopping. Their spending has led to divorce, bankruptcy, second mortgages.\"</p> <p>But why are women and not men so afflicted by a problem Koran views as part of a cluster of obsessive-compulsive disorders? \"I believe it is because women are assigned the role of shopper in our culture. The act itself is done to relieve anxiety and shopping is a culturally acceptable way for women to behave. If you look at another impulse control disorder, pulling one's hair out, that is also 90% women and I think this may be because women are socialised to be more attentive to their appearance. So in all these impulse control disorders, there may be a cultural component.\"</p> <p>But in studying 19 female and two male compulsive shoppers at the Obsessive Compulsive Disorders Clinic at Stanford, Koran has run smack into controversy. Typically, in cases of compulsions such as alcohol or food, behavioural therapy in conjunction with 12-step programmes is considered the most powerful cure. But Koran is trying a different tack: drugs. He is giving patients the antidepressant SSRI (a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor), in the Prozac family, testing the theory that compulsive shopping is a response to low levels of serotonin, which are linked to depression.</p> <p>\"There is a study to suggest cognitive behaviour therapy is helpful,\" Koran says. \"But if you look at the disorder as a symptom of depression - and we know drugs counteract depression - then it is reasonable to try it.\"</p> <p>But is compulsive buying a disease of a broken psyche or a robust economy? Shopping today is not what it once was, a humble trip down the high street. The internet, catalogues and home shopping on TV all allow you to shop around the clock and indulge your every whim. You feel like owning a Fendi baguette bag at 3am? No problem.</p> <p>Compulsive shopping is not listed as a mental disorder in the official diagnostic manual of the American Psychiatric Association and Koran has been questioned about prescribing drugs for a problem some believe is not neurochemical. Worse, there are assertions in the US that drug companies, eager to expand the use of their products, fund research into a \"new\" disorder for which they, conveniently, have a cure.</p> <p>Koran says he approached a drug company, not the other way round. \"Critics suggest drug companies are creating the disorder to market their drug. But these people are truly suffering. We didn't create the problem - they are compulsive spenders and we are looking to help them.\"</p> <p>Despite a 1997 study at the University of Iowa which found little difference between drugs and a placebo in curing shopaholics, Koran says his studies have been promising. \"Patients are reporting feeling less anxiety, less depression, less impulsivity. The women in the study are saying: 'I'm not thinking about shopping'.\"</p> <p>But can you really cure shopaholics with a drug? Los Angeles clinical psychologist Robert Butterworth says the Stanford study is bunk. \"Business is getting bad for drug companies, so they have to create new diseases they can 'cure'. I think the idea that you can cure compulsive spending with a pill is a giant con.\" He says women shop to reduce feelings of anxiety, isolation and low self-esteem. \"Shopping gives them a temporary emotional lift. But it never lasts.\"</p> <p>Typically, when women overshop, they buy clothes, jewellery and cosmetics, Koran says. They think if they look better, they might feel better. Conversely men, who constitute 10% of compulsive shoppers, buy items that relate to their idealised selves. In a study of 61 British students between 1994 and 1996, University of Sussex psychologist Helga Dittmar PhD found spendaholic men buy hi-tech toys, electronic and sports equipment - purchases that boost their self-image.</p> <p>This all sounds very rational, but what about sex? There is a school of psychology, much of it Freudian, that suggests shopping is a substitute for sex. Entering the store is foreplay, finding an item is penetration, buying the item, hearing that ka-ching! of the register, is climax. Maybe women do shop simply to sublimate sexual tension: if they can't find release in the bedroom, are they finding it at Bloomingdale's or Harrods?</p> <p>Butterworth says this is not as ridiculous as it sounds. \"Women shop primarily to relieve feelings of emptiness and shopping makes them feel full. Certainly if a woman is shopping compulsively, I would advise her husband to ask himself what is happening, or not happening, in the bedroom. If women are looking for love, the answer is to go find love, don't look for bargains.\"</p> <p>Koran sees the problem predominantly in medical terms. He believes therapy is an important adjunct, but says if low serotonin is driving these women to impulsive behaviour, increasing their serotonin levels could be the answer. And while the study isn't finished, he is confident that, for some women, it will work.</p> <p>Butterworth, on the other hand, believes talk therapy, giving women insights into their behaviour so they take steps to curtail it, is the only long-term answer. \"The problem today is that we are all victims and have no power over ourselves. If you allow women to take a pill, you are creating a dependency and they will never take responsibility for their lives. The only way for women to overcome overspending is to learn to control it themselves by identifying the void in their lives. And cutting up their credit cards wouldn't hurt either.\"</p>",

As the rock jamboree in Somerset drew to a close, Mr Eavis suggested 10,000-15,000 wormed their way through gaps in the wall or climbed over, but other official sources put the number of fence-jumpers at nearer to 30,000. Security guards struggled to patrol the 11-mile perimeter fence and chase away the gangs of baseball capped boys levering open sections of corrugated metal and collecting \u00a35 from those wanting to get through the fence. Police warned at the weekend of thieves stealing bags as fans tried to jump over, but thousands still flooded in to mingle with 80,000 legitimate ticket holders who had paid \u00a387 per head. Mr Eavis said security guards were partly to blame for the problem of fans sneaking in without paying. \"We need better security. They're not brilliant, I must say.

Neither side pressed charges. As ever, theft of possessions from tents - and sometimes the entire tent - was the most common crime. Nearly 900 tent related thefts had been reported by yesterday morning, on course to match last year's figure of over 1,300 for the weekend. Despite the freeloaders, Mr Eavis voted this year: \"The best I've ever had.\" He added: \"I plan to carry on with it as long as I am fit, and I am feeling exceedingly fit at the moment.\" He revealed that this year's festival had cost around \u00a37m and has made \u00a37.5m from ticket sales and vendors' fees. Festival organisers seek to give \u00a3600,000-\u00a3700,000 to charities each time it is held. This year those donations will swallow up any profits. As glorious sunshine broke out over Worthy Farm yesterday, festival goers said it had been superlative. Macy Gray had asked the crowd on Friday: \"Do you like getting muddy?\" But no one had to get too dirty this weekend as even Travis - whose hit Why Does It Always Rain On Me? is thought to be jinxed - failed to provoke a downpour. Travis, this year's Saturday headliners on the main pyramid stage, played a humble afternoon slot on the \"Other\" stage last year. A clearly awe-struck lead singer Fran Healy could not stop grinning as he walked on stage after sunset. Before him, as far as the eye could see, was a vast cheering crowd holding up torches here and there and waving flags. Introducing a track from the band's hugely successful album, The Man Who, Healy declared: \"This song is about lowering the guard you put up as you grow old. Once you pull it down someone might slap you or kiss you, but whether they slap you or kiss you, you still feel alive.\" Earlier the Pet Shop Boys had proved a surprise hit, pleasing the crowd with a selection of their best known 1980s numbers and bringing on Catatonia singer Cerys Matthews for a duet. She took the place of Dusty Springfield on What Have I Done To Deserve This? The crowd lapped it all up, cheerfully waving their arms in unison to group's encore, the camp anthem Go West. Lounging on the grass in front of the main stage yesterday, Vicki Bateman, 24, from Guildford said: \"This is my eighth time and it's one of the best. There are fewer drug pushers around and you are free to do what you want to do.\" David Bowie was due to take the main stage last night for the first time since 1971, when he played the free festival.

He wanted to find his wife and family, and with several police officers on hand to guard the voting precinct and a long line of people patiently queuing to cast their ballots in Zimbabwe's parliamentary election he hoped he might be safe.</p> <p>Mr Chamunoro used to be district chairman of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change in one of the most tense places in this election campaign - Murehwa North, north-east of Harare. He was beaten unconscious and taken captive on April 25 by a gang working for President Robert Mugabe's party, Zanu-PF.</p> <p>Remarkably, he was not let go, like other prominent MDC supporters once they have been worked over. He was taken to a base camp and forced to sign a Zanu-PF membership card. Then, he says, for a period of several weeks after his captors felt they had broken him, he was taken with the gangs as they terrorised local villagers.</p> <p>His inside story of how the intimidation works is unique.</p> <p>\"We used to go out about six days a week,\" he said. \"The leader would take us for drinks and pay for everything. Then we would move into a village and seek out the local headman, and ask him for a list of all MDC supporters. We would then hunt them down and administer severe beatings.</p> <p>\"I was forced to take part myself. I was carrying a whip and axe handle. I was afraid for my life and had to go along.</p> <p>\"I was also taken to four rallies attended by Zanu-PF candidates. Our gang and other Zanu-PF youth forced people to take part. We would go into the villages and round people up.\"</p> <p>Another tactic, he said, was to put on MDC T-shirts, \"and if people responded positively they would be beaten\".</p> <p>Mr Chamunoro has a gap where one of his front teeth used to be. The last thing he remembers before he was captured was a stone slamming into his mouth. But the Zanu-PF gang at least took him to the health clinic in Murehwa, and he has a medical card confirming that he was an assault victim.</p> <p>After five weeks he managed to escape late one night when, he said, he was allowed for the first time to visit the lavatory without escort. He ran into the bush, and walked for several miles before finding a house where he spent the night. Early next morning he took a bus to Harare.</p> <p>As we drove to Murehwa on Saturday, he nervously tapped the dashboard for much of the journey. He had found no way of sending word to his family that he was still alive, and was not sure what reprisals might have been visited on them because of his escape.</p> <p>But he was optimistic that the MDC would win the election. \"I voted for Zanu-PF in 1995 but changed my mind because of the constant rise in the cost of living and the corruption of ministers. When the MDC appeared, I soon joined it.\"</p> <p>Until Zanu's intimidation of opponents - intensified in recent weeks as the election drew close - it was easy to recruit people, he said. \"A lot in my village joined. They pay Z$10 [about 16p] for a party card. Young people and women were the main supporters. About 80% in my village support the MDC.</p> <p>\"It's the headman and the older men who are pro-Zanu. The headman has been promised Z$10,000 (\u00a3167) if Zanu wins, but they also use the argument that Mugabe will do nothing to help our village if he loses. They also say that Zanu is the party which won our freedom, and the ancestors will be angry if we don't support it. That seems to affect the older men particularly.\"</p> <p>Arriving in Chitimbe, where the voting was taking place - about 3 miles from his village - Mr Chamunoro pointed out the burnt-out chassis of a car, saying it belonged to a teacher who had fled to Harare with his family.</p> <p>Five other teachers from nearby villages had done likewise, he said. Teachers have been special targets of the Zanu-PF gangs because they are all thought to be pro-MDC and have local influence as the best educated people.</p> <p>His anxiety visibly rising, Mr Chamunoro wanted to drive right into the school grounds, as close to the voters' queue as we could get. We stopped beside a wall. Neighbours waved in astonishment. Most thought he was dead.</p> <p>But he was too scared to get out of the car. \"I can see some of the Zanu-PF people,\" he whispered. A neighbour found Mr Chamunoro\"s wife in the queue and she came over with their nine-month-old baby, the youngest of their five children.</p> <p>She greeted him with a warm slapping handshake - the Shona culture not being a demonstrative one - and handed him the baby before getting in the car. A few more people came and chatted before we drove off and parked several hundred metres away while he and his wife discussed what to do.</p> <p>Of those who had come to greet him, Mr Chamunoro said: \"One of them was a member of the Zanu gang. He actually asked how I was...But they think you are armed, which is why they will not do anything.\"</p> <p>Naomi Chamunoro said the gang had come several times to their house to search for her husband, most recently the night before the voting began on Saturday. Having seen him now, they were bound to come back. It was unsafe for her to stay.</p> <p>We drove the three miles towards the family's remote village, parked, crossed the fields and waded through a small river. The Chamunoros grow a little cotton, and vegetables, which Kudzi sells in Harare.</p> <p>Naomi packed a bag, locked the house, and sent word by a neighbour to her mother, who lives 500 metres away, to look after the girls until their parents' return.</p> <p>\"How long do you think that will be?\" I asked as we drove the 50 miles back to Harare.</p> <p>The couple consulted in Shona. \"If Zanu-PF wins, they are sure to go after anyone who supported MDC. We may have to stay away for several week,\" Mr Chamunoro replied eventually.</p> <p>\"If we win, and I am sure we will, we'll have to give them time to get over their anger and adjust to the new reality. Perhaps we can go home already next weekend.\"</p>",

They are anxious to state publicly that we have 120,000 medical practitioners who are highly compe tent, hardworking, compassionate and dedicated,\" Dr Armstrong said. </p> <p>\"Inevitably, they will feel bruised by the sustained period of criticism.

It would also relieve the shortage of intensive care beds that was a main cause of cancelled admissions for surgery. </p> <p>Dr Armstrong said the conference was unlikely to pass a motion calling for the disbandment of the GMC, but there would be calls for its reform. </p> <p>The conference will debate a motion from senior hospital medical staff expressing \"no confidence in the GMC as currently constituted and functioning\". </p> <p>\u0095 The commission for health improvement will today start a programme of hospital inspections to check on quality and involvement of patients in decisions. </p> <p>\u0095 A Tory government would scrap taxes on workers who sign up to free medical insurance in an attempt to expand private healthcare use, Liam Fox, shadow health secretary, said yesterday on BBC1's On the Record.</p>",

Mr Armstrong said today's conference would show that doctors were angry, bruised and cynical about the government's promises of extra NHS funding. The profession felt unjustly criticised after the recent spate of medical scandals, including the serial killer GP Harold Shipman and disgraced gynaecologist Rodney Ledward. \"I have no doubt you will hear doctors who are battered and angry with the government and media. They are anxious to state publicly that we have 120,000 medical practitioners who are highly compe tent, hardworking, compassionate and dedicated,\" Dr Armstrong said. \"Inevitably, they will feel bruised by the sustained period of criticism. In recent weeks the tide has begun to turn with ministers stating publicly that doctors do a brilliant job. But that vote of confidence will not have sunk in for the majority of doctors. \"You will detect cynicism about the government's modernisation agenda and any announcement about increased spending.\" Extra money coming into the NHS had so far done little but pay off past debt. If the government wanted early improvements, it would create jobs for 150 newly qualified obstetricians who could not find posts as consultants. It would also relieve the shortage of intensive care beds that was a main cause of cancelled admissions for surgery. Dr Armstrong said the conference was unlikely to pass a motion calling for the disbandment of the GMC, but there would be calls for its reform. The conference will debate a motion from senior hospital medical staff expressing \"no confidence in the GMC as currently constituted and functioning\". \u0095 The commission for health improvement will today start a programme of hospital inspections to check on quality and involvement of patients in decisions. \u0095 A Tory government would scrap taxes on workers who sign up to free medical insurance in an attempt to expand private healthcare use, Liam Fox, shadow health secretary, said yesterday on BBC1's On the Record.",

In January Mr Sanchez was arrested as an illegal immigrant and jailed pending deportation. His detention has provoked the anger of his supporters, who include the radical state senator Tom Hayden. Last month they placed a full-page advert in the New York Times urging his release. \"If Alex is deported to El Salvador, the police chief of San Salvador says he'll likely be killed by death squads, who make no distinction between current and former gang members,\" the advert said. \"In recent month three leaders of Homies Unidos San Salvador [where the group originally started] have been gunned down...Alex keeps people out of prison. Isn't he the kind of person Los Angeles needs?\" Five leading LA lawyers have filed a civil rights case claiming that police from the Rampart division assaulted and harassed members of Homies Unidos. This is a deliberate imitation of a current anti-gang initiative by the police, whereby gang members are served with an injunction which puts them under a local curfew. One of the lawyers, Paul Hoffman, said: \"We want the police to stop acting like gangs,\" he said. The action seeks damages against the police on behalf of four Homies Unidos members. The LAPD would not comment on the case yesterday. Last year a former Rampart division member, Rafael Perez, who had been arrested for reselling seized drugs, gave information against dozens of his former colleagues in exchange for a five-year jail sentence. Eighty-one convictions of people arrested by Rampart division officers have now been overturned. The city is facing many claims for wrongful arrest, totalling millions of dollars. Perez's revelations have led to the disbandment of the police anti-gang unit, Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums, (Crash). A replacement unit is being assembled. \"They say Crash was dissolved, but its officers are still working the same neighbourhoods,\" said the founder of Homies Unidos, Magdaleno Rose-Avila. \"You can call a doberman pinscher a chihuahua, but it's still a doberman pinscher.\" Mr Hayden, who has been involved in a number of peace talks between rival gangs in LA, said: \"He [Alex] and Homies Unidos were trying to save lives.\"",
