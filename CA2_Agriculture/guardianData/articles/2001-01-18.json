They are life's first lesson that \"there's no such thing as a free lunch.\" </p> <p>My youngest grandchild had her first \"music lesson\" recently. Maisie is just one year old. This, I know, may be enough to appal those currently worried that formal education is creeping ever earlier and stealing childhood from the very young.

Maisie's music lesson falls into this category. </p> <p>A young mother who is keen on music has round to her home some 10 children to share in musical play. She provides simple, small instruments - shakers, drums, a xylophone - and everyone sits round on the floor learning to listen. She teaches them to distinguish long sounds - a jug pouring water - from short sounds - something dropped into water. </p> <p>And there is even a taste of classical music, too.

The danger occurs when ambitious parents sign up their children for formal lessons with the glint of grades and exams in their eye. </p> <p>Some of my grandchildren do Kumon, the system of maths-teaching in the home that instils by regular practise an easy familiarity with numbers and tables. In my schooldays, we chanted them until we could recite them in our sleep. Even today, faced with a tricky calculation, I still resort to a quick chant. But all that went out of fashion, condemned as rote learning with all its attendant ills (what were they exactly?). </p> <p>Now Kumon is sneaking back into the same territory, though they perhaps wouldn't admit it. The daily paper - 10 minutes' worth of sums to fill in - teaches both an understanding of how numbers work and also, by regular repetition, a rapid recall of what they amount to. This makes children comfortable with maths at school. My grandchildren nominate maths as their favourite subject - probably because they get the sums right. </p> <p>But there is another benefit of equal value. Ten minutes in a quiet room, with no distractions, no talk, no television, no moving around, teaches concentration - a skill worth having in almost any job, in any walk of life. Classrooms in today's schools, especially in primary schools, can't provide that utter quiet. Most homes probably can, and most mothers welcome it - not to mention grandmothers. </p> <p>But there is an issue on which the generations differ in my family. The Commons select committee on education has just declared the idea of allowing childminders to smack as \"totally unacceptable\". I agree: I am totally against assaulting children - especially when they're so small!

      "body": "<p>Crystal Palace kept this tie alive into extra-time before bowing to their Premiership visitors.</p> <p> Despite losing Daniele Dichio, sent off after picking up two yellow cards in his 14-minute cameo, Sunderland went through to a fourth-round tie at home to Ipswich with goals from Kevin Phillips and Kevin Kilbane. </p> <p> Thomson's goal, struck from a Hayden Mullins cross, came after Thomas Sorensen had denied Dougie Freedman on a late one-on-one and was reward for Crystal Palace's refusal to accept defeat after being overrun for much of the second half. </p> <p> Although Sunderland's rise to second place in the Premiership meant they began this replay as favourites, they must have arrived with some trepidation. They were beaten here by Palace in a Worthington Cup quarter-final last month and were relegated on this ground in 1997. </p> <p> Yet they started promisingly, looking the more composed team, and could easily have taken the lead. When Alex Kolinko raced out of his area to hack clear of Kevin Phillips, Alex Rae had a chance to lob into an empty net from around 30 yards but missed the target. </p> <p> Gradually, though, Palace found their range and began to dominate. Mixing some neat passing with plenty of long balls designed to exploit the pace of Clinton Morrison down the centre or the speed of the lively Latvian Andrejs Rubins on the left flank, they might have scored three times in quick succession. </p> <p> After Morrison and Stephen Thomson had wasted chances, it needed a fine save from Thomas Sorensen to prevent Morrison converting a Rubins cross from close range.

      "bodyText": "Crystal Palace kept this tie alive into extra-time before bowing to their Premiership visitors. Despite losing Daniele Dichio, sent off after picking up two yellow cards in his 14-minute cameo, Sunderland went through to a fourth-round tie at home to Ipswich with goals from Kevin Phillips and Kevin Kilbane. Thomson's goal, struck from a Hayden Mullins cross, came after Thomas Sorensen had denied Dougie Freedman on a late one-on-one and was reward for Crystal Palace's refusal to accept defeat after being overrun for much of the second half. Although Sunderland's rise to second place in the Premiership meant they began this replay as favourites, they must have arrived with some trepidation. They were beaten here by Palace in a Worthington Cup quarter-final last month and were relegated on this ground in 1997. Yet they started promisingly, looking the more composed team, and could easily have taken the lead. When Alex Kolinko raced out of his area to hack clear of Kevin Phillips, Alex Rae had a chance to lob into an empty net from around 30 yards but missed the target. Gradually, though, Palace found their range and began to dominate. Mixing some neat passing with plenty of long balls designed to exploit the pace of Clinton Morrison down the centre or the speed of the lively Latvian Andrejs Rubins on the left flank, they might have scored three times in quick succession. After Morrison and Stephen Thomson had wasted chances, it needed a fine save from Thomas Sorensen to prevent Morrison converting a Rubins cross from close range. When Sunderland fell behind to Morrison's 17th goal of the season, it was scarely a surprise. The visitors were responsible for their own misfortune, Rae misdirecting a header that sent Morrison through. The 21-year-old striker, wanted by Jamaica and Ireland and on this form perhaps soon by England, finished powerfully from just inside the area. Palace continued to press, more than matching Sunderland's renowned strength and work-rate in midfield and looking particularly dangerous whenever they got the ball wide and crossed. All the same, it needed two good saves by Kolinko to deny Sunderland an equaliser before half-time. Having first stopped a Phillips snap-shot after Niall Quinn had set up the chance, he impressively blocked another Phillips effort with his body. The Quinn-Phillips combination should have brought Sunderland level inside two minutes of the restart, but the England striker clipped the ball wide from close range. That was the start of virtual one-way traffic from Sunderland as Palace, forced to reorganise when Fan Zhiyi went off injured, lost their zip. Yet for all their dominance the Premiership side were struggling to find a way past Kolinko. Having denied Gavin McCann, the Latvian saved well from Darren Williams and Don Hutchison. A moment of magic from Quinn, though, turned the tie on its head. Chesting the ball down with his back to goal the Irishman spun and sent a brilliant volley into the corner. A minute later Phillips shook off Hayden Mullins and, unpeturbed by his earlier misses, sent a low shot in off the post. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

But Collymore has already guaranteed himself a feisty Glaswegian welcome by declaring his love for Rangers. </p> <p>\"Without wishing to be contentious, how could I ever sign for Celtic when my soft spot is, and always has been, for the blue half of Glasgow?\" he told Rangers Monthly in October. </p> <p>\"Everyone down south is either a Celtic or Rangers fan and I am a Gers supporter. It stems from my mid-teens when I never seemed to have the Rangers shirt off my back. At the time guys like Terry Butcher were moving to Glasgow, and the Graeme Souness era really settled it for me. </p> <p>\"Even now I always look for Rangers' results every weekend, and if anyone asks me who I support it's definitely Rangers.

      "bodyText": "Stan Collymore's remarkable talent for controversy could undermine his proposed move to Celtic even before he arrives in Scotland for talks. The out-of-favour Bradford City striker, who turns 30 on Monday, hopes to rejoin Celtic's manager Martin O'Neill in an deal that would see Tommy Johnson move to Valley Parade. But Collymore has already guaranteed himself a feisty Glaswegian welcome by declaring his love for Rangers. \"Without wishing to be contentious, how could I ever sign for Celtic when my soft spot is, and always has been, for the blue half of Glasgow?\" he told Rangers Monthly in October. \"Everyone down south is either a Celtic or Rangers fan and I am a Gers supporter. It stems from my mid-teens when I never seemed to have the Rangers shirt off my back. At the time guys like Terry Butcher were moving to Glasgow, and the Graeme Souness era really settled it for me. \"Even now I always look for Rangers' results every weekend, and if anyone asks me who I support it's definitely Rangers. I would love to play at Ibrox one day.\" As only he can, Collymore appeared to have had a change of allegiance last night. \"Celtic would definitely appeal to me,\" he said. \"They are a massive club and obviously geared up for success.\" Collymore has been surplus to Jim Jefferies' requirements at Bradford since the manager decided that, along with Benito Carbone and Dan Petrescu, the talented but troublesome striker would not be a part of the fight against relegation. Celtic are due to have further talks with Bradford today. Monaco, meanwhile, have made discreet inquiries of Manchester United about Mark Bosnich's availability.

      "body": "<p>Thursday was my first full day alone again now that Josh has gone back, and I though I'd be at a loss for what to do. As it happened, myself and two others from the hostel went to watch the Adidas International tennis at the Olympic park, Sydney so I didn't have time to feel sorry for myself! We arrived early and stayed 'til late so we could enjoy as much tennis as possible plus have a look round the park itself. </p> <p>The whole place, like Sydney, is incredibly clean and has all the signs of having been recently done up for the Olympics - there was plenty going on throughout the day. As for the tennis, some of the highlight matches included Martinez winning, Lleyton Hewitt winning (backed by an extremely enthusiastic and biased Aussie crowd), and Anna Kournikova in a doubles match. I think it's safe to say a lot of the crowd weren't interested in her tennis ability, which I would imagine gets pretty frustrating (not that I'd complain if I was her!) </p> <p>The next day myself and Brian, a fellow hosteller from LA, walked to Randwick just outside of Coogee to make use of the university's internet facilities. There are some advantages to looking like a student. We spent the afternoon on the beach - my first trip there since arriving in Coogee - which is pretty remarkable as it's only two minutes walk away. We played electronic chess and Brian wasn't too happy that I managed to beat him - still it entertained me! </p> <p>That evening we went to Centennial Park to watch a 'Moonlight cinema' showing - films shown at night on a large outdoor screen. But the evening didn't run as planned. The film we thought we were going to see was Grease, so after a few minutes of watching a film about insects we were beginning to get concerned.. . it wasn't until I plucked up the courage to ask someone that we realised our mistake. Yes Grease was on, but in Adelaide. The film we'd been watching was Microcosmos - literally, a film about insects. </p> <p>The next evening I went into Sydney to listen to a huge free jazz concert held in the domain (a large grassy area). It was brilliantly well attended, the bands were lively and funky, which made for an enjoyable evening drinking wine on the grass. Despite the fact I didn't get to bed until 4am, I was rudely awakened at 8am by the arrival of a new room-mate, Steve, who just would not stop chatting despite my monosyllabic replies. Deciding that now I was awake I may as well get up, myself, Steve and our Canadian room-mate Gabrielle headed out for a walk and a stop at the Clovelly hotel just along the coast. I got a lot of stick that day for insisting on drinking orange juice, but to be honest, drinking every day wears thin very quickly - although some people seem to manage it! </p> <p>That evening a whole group of us stayed in to watch videos. It made a pleasant change, although the whole thing seems a far cry from the exhilaration of the blue mountains - I've promised to treat myself to do something special every so often so I don't start to feel like I could easily be in England. </p> <p>Monday was incredibly hot - 40C. I headed into Sydney to try and avoid the heat by getting some jobs done such as open-ending my flight ticket - I no longer have any set dates on it - and to get a tax code for when I start work. Even the city was pretty sticky so I was quite glad for the cool of the evening and the chance to test out my improved cooking skills with spaghetti bolognese. Well, it's a start! </p> <p>A group of us from the hostel took the bus to Palm Beach, the location for the filming of Home and Away. Besides seeing the beach itself, we were disappointed by how little there was there. I suppose we'd hoped to see some filming, even though I'm not a fan myself, but all we saw was the shooting of a deodorant advert for the UK - so when it comes out remember I saw it first! </p> <p>In the evening Brian and I made another attempt to watch a film at Centennial Park. Over the last few days he's been insisting that The Breakfast Club was a classic film and was shocked that I hadn't heard of it (I think he put it down to me being English). I doubted his judgement, but I have to admit it was brilliant - an 80s brat-pack classic. We'd even brought a proper picnic this time so it definitely compensated for the last one - and hopefully put an end to the days of teasing we've had from the others at the hostel! </p> <p>I'm looking forward more than anything to the time when I can move on again - and I've made the decision to go to New Zealand and the South Island, largely due to many people who've emailed me to tell me it's unmissable. But until then, I'm going to have to settle down a bit - but hopefully not too much! </p> <p>Yesterday morning I had a job interview at a local hotel. I was fairly nervous, as the hotel is both incredibly posh and enormous, but the interview itself was surprisingly relaxing. In fact the interviewer was English and more keen to talk about how much better than Australian pubs English ones are! I felt pretty good about it, but I won't find out until next week if I got it - I'll let you know. </p> <p>That afternoon I started making myself a proper temporary Australian resident - I got a phone and a bank account, which made me feel disturbingly like I was setting up a short-term life here - and a pretty good life all in all. Later there was a barbeque to celebrate a hosteller's last day. That's one good thing about hostel life - there constantly seems to be something to celebrate! Despite it raining heavily - see, it does rain here too - it was a fun afternoon and a great feed. Australians definitely have the right idea with barbeques, you can find public ones everywhere, so anybody at any time can get together and have a 'barbie'. </p> <p>There is an incredibly strong backpacker presence in Coogee, and there have been plenty of local newspaper reports complaining about their behaviour and particularly that of the English. I think some people just see travelling as a way to party every night without restrictions and don't consider that other people actually live in these places too.</p> <p>'Til next week (hopefully employed) milly</p>",

      "bodyText": "Partnerships and mergers within the voluntary sector have been moving steadily up the agenda of many charities. Drivers for closer links between organisations include pressure from funders and growing media and public concern about duplication of services. Increased pressures on fundraising mean a growing number of charities face financial problems and are seeking to share infrastructure costs or, in some cases, merge with a larger organisation. But despite these pressures, closer collaboration is proving to be a slow process thanks to the practical difficulties or pooling resources, and reluctance by many trustees and managers to give up their independence. Des Palmer, a consultant who has studied mergers in the carers' sector, says: \"Often, staff in charities find it difficult to move outside their set roles and many staff are keen to protect what they see as their domains.\" He adds that he was involved in a joint application from two charities for lottery funding recently: \"It took applications twice as long as usual because one of the problems was who would take overall responsibility for the project. There is always a danger in joint working that unless someone is put in overall charge, responsibilities fall between two stools.\" Yet there are a growing number of joint working examples and of merger talks. One of the most important was the announcement by the Cancer Research Campaign and the Imperial Cancer Research Fund recently that they were considering a merger. Another example is the partnership between the homeless charities Shelter and Crisis in the government-funded Millennium Plus homelessness project. In this, Shelter provides the advice to homeless people and Crisis the accommodation. Rebecca Carpenter, project manager of Millennium Plus, said: \"We set up the partnership because we both felt we had different expertise and it was important to focus on that rather than each try and do everything.\" But the partnership has not been without its problems. \"It's not been easy because different organisations have different ways of working.\" She stresses the importance of being clear from the outset what the goals of the collaboration are and that there must be agreed protocols governing practical issues such as how often meetings will be held between the two organisations, what they will cover and who will chair them. \"We've both learned a lot from the experience and once you've built a relationship with another voluntary organisation it's much easier to repeat it in the future,\" says Ms Carpenter. Sharon Norrish, director of consulting and development at Charities Aid Foundation, said the organisations have had more enquiries from charities about collaboration and merger in the past year than ever before. She said: \"One of the main drivers is that charities want to organise their resources more effectively and that often means a partnership of some form. Whether it leads to merger is another question.\" Such partnerships range from sharing infrastructure costs, such as a finance manager or computer system, to delivering a charity's mission through an alliance with another voluntary organisation in a similar field. \"We've had enquires from a large variety of charities, ranging from healthcare and care of the elderly to recreational areas like caving clubs,\" said Ms Norrish. She believes the increasing experience many charities have of working in partnerships with statutory organisations such as health authorities or councils is giving them the confidence to consider alliances with other voluntary groups. Yes there is still a long way to go, argues Mr Palmer: \"You can find examples of joint working and merger in the sector but they tend to be few and far between and there's a lot more potential for collaboration in campaigning, lobbying and service provision.\"",

Where Wilson lost 15 byelections in just under five years, this government hasn't lost any, making it the first in 45 years (except for the short-lived outfit of February 1974) to keep a clean sheet.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair last night infuriated William Hague and Charles Kennedy by rejecting proposals by the BBC and ITV for a three-way televised election debate on the grounds that Britain's democratic combat is lively enough without one. The prime minister's decision not to risk such a high-profile contest had been widely expected but prompted taunts that Mr Blair is what the Tory leader dubbed \"a real chicken\". Mr Kennedy said the prime minister was unwilling to debate without the \"400 cheerleaders\" who sit behind him in the Commons. Mr Hague even urged the broadcasters to go ahead with the two proposed debates anyway. \"If Tony Blair still refuses to show, we'll just leave an empty chair with a big sign of 'coward' for where Tony Blair would have sat if he'd had the guts to turn up,\" he said. The televising of prime minister's questions in the Common, and the robust traditions of parliamentary and media debate in Britain, were used to justify Labour's refusal to take part in the American-style debates. \"The UK is not electing a president and our constitutional positions are entirely different,\" Mr Blair's official spokesman, Alastair Campbell, told reporters yesterday. Mr Campbell had raised broadcasters' hopes in December, saying publicly that the idea was \"perfectly good in principle\" and that \"my hunch is that at some stage it will happen\". But he and other senior advisers concluded this week that media obsession with election \"process\" - of which two TV debates would be an obsessive example - would only serve to detract from Labour's policy message. \"We want to concentrate on the issues which really matter to people,\" the Scottish secretary, John Reid, told Channel 4 News last night. Peter Mandelson and Labour pollster Philip Gould are said to have backed the \"withdrawal with dignity\" strategy. Labour was determined to say yes or no before the campaign starts, probably in late March, to stop the issue being a distraction - as it was in 1997 when John Major made a desperate plea for a confrontation on TV. Party officials and MPs engaged in campaign planning on all sides were therefore not surprised that Mr Blair would find an excuse. \"There's not much in it for him,\" said one. But the reasons given in a letter by Labour's communications director, ex-BBC journalist Lance Price, are those that have always existed. \"By comparison with other democracies, we have in the UK very lively political and media debate on a constant basis,\" he said. Ministers will also be available to voters to discuss all the relevant issues outside \"the Westminster village\" in the election, he promised. Blair aides denied that George W Bush's success in America - where he had been seen as the underdog but performed well in debates - was a factor. The TV proposals had raised the prospect of legal challenges - demanding equal time or other restrictions - by smaller parties, notably the Scottish Nationalists. When Mr Blair took part in a \"meet the prime minister\" session with voters in Leeds on ITV last month, the SNP successfully complained to the Independent Television Commission because a byelection was taking place in Falkirk at the time. The BBC and ITV had buried their differences in favour of two debates - one chaired by David Dimbleby on the BBC, the other by his brother, Jonathan, on ITV. But despite Mr Kennedy and Mr Hague saying they would agree without condition, the January 31 deadline loomed without real negotiation taking place. Mr Price explained: \"Much is made of that fact that US presidential candidates hold TV debates. But we are not the US.\" He pointed out that \"when a sitting president is being challenged, his opponent is not known until a few months before the election. When a president is retiring, neither candidate is known until that time\".

      "body": "<p>My worst present was my whole Xmas stocking. Two ties (one comedy/musical), one pair of fake Versace pants, and a jar of aubergine pickle. I know I'm a just-turned-30 new dad, but did my wife have to rub it in? <br><strong>Joe Hallgarten </strong></p> <p>The worst Christmas present I ever had was a local history of Auchterarder - a place I've never been to. <br><strong>James Andrew </strong></p> <p>My mother gives two kinds of presents: solid thoughtful ones and small worrying ones. Last year the small worrying presents included parsley-oil breath freshener pills. This year we got several pine-scented car deodorizers and little pillows of cedar shavings. I'm afraid she's trying to tell us something. <br><strong>Martha Bridgegam, USA </strong></p> <p>Had a bit of a run recently... Christmas 1998... Q) What to get for grandad, the man with everything? A) As a last resort, a Body Shop shaving kit. Christmas 1999... the exact same shaving kit, re-wrapped in exactly the same paper is returned to me. Christmas 2000... a brand spanking new B-B-Q... excellent except it was from relatives who have visited my 4th floor, balcony-less, roof-terrace-less apartment... thanks! <br><strong>Chris Raybould</strong></p> <p>Relatives - you've got to love them. No, you've GOT to love them, it's the law, even in the face of the most blatant \"Don't love me\" provocation. My darling auntie, as thoughtful as ever, asked me what I wanted for Xmas. Well, being a young go-ahead kind of a thing, I'd just got hold of a new dinky mobile to keep my cool and social life flowing nicely. \"Something for my new moby, auntie\" I foolishly hinted, forgetting that the devil's in the detail, and expecting a nice new fascia, hands free kit or some such. <br>Come Christmas Day and a nicely wrapped box dropped in my lap from auntie. Ripping open the wrapping with none-too-indecent haste, my eyes alighted on... a piece of plastic. With some blue liquid and two other bits of grey plastic trapped inside, and a gap. <br>Hmm... turning it over, I found the instructions: \"Oil Dolphin Phone Holder\", and next to them a sticker professing the true quality of my gift: \"Made in China\" (no offence to your chinese readers, but come on...). So, there's these two proto-dolphins trapped in blue oily stuff, and a gap for the phone... which is far too big for my new dinky phone, which just slips over every time I try to prop it up to show my new gift doing it's thing. Much as my smile kept slipping every time I tried to convince my aunt that I was pleased with her gift. This 'product' is a true challenge to the taste of the e-Bay audience. Roll on next year... <br><strong>Shashi Desai</strong></p> <p>One of the worst and most soul destroying Christmas presents I ever received was a jar of pickled onions from my grandmother. This is after spending a year cleaning, organising and running the fairly large B&amp;B she owns on the west coast of Scotland. She thought her present was genuinely generous as she thought I liked 'that kind of spicy food'. <br><strong>Martin Lockhart </strong></p> <p>The worst Christmas present that I ever received was a few years ago when we were very short of money. I didn't expect very much for Christmas - a small box of chocolates maybe. But on Christmas Eve hubby said mysteriously that he had to go out for an hour or so. On his return he was smiling like the cat that had got the cream and eventually admitted that he had been out to get my present. I deduced from his manner that he had got me something I really wanted. <br> On Christmas morning everyone opened their presents - but there was nothing there for me. Hubby smiled mysteriously again and said it wasn't in the house and I'd have to find it. I wrapped up warmly and began a systematic search of the coal-shed, garage, garden and hut. An hour later, fingers becoming numb, I pleaded for a clue. He informed me it was in the car. Silly me! I searched the glove compartment, under the seats, in the boot - nothing! \"Try under the bonnet\" he hinted. Curiously I opened the bonnet - and there it was: a new battery, plumbed in. He still can't understand why I didn't say thank you! <br><strong>Amanda Fergusson</strong></p> <p>My least favourite present this year was a pack of dishtowels, dusters and a can of polish. However, it didn't come from my husband as a heavy hint that I needed to brush up on my housekeeping skills, but from my eight year old daughter who had saved very very hard from her pocket money. I told her it was the nicest present I had ever received and in that moment I meant it too! <br><strong>Irene Hunter </strong></p> <p>My worst Christmas present was an umbrella that wouldn't stay up - ever. On it's first outing it collapsed on me, knocking my glasses off,which subsequently broke on the pavement! <br><strong>Robert Ridler</strong></p> <p>We were poor when I was a lad. And we were Northern. Poor And From Wigan is quite a different poor to Poor And From Kent. Now we have set the scene, cast back your mind to (about) 1980. BigTracks. I had spent an entire year dropping hints to my parents that I needed a BigTrack. BigTrack was the robot which could, using its catterpillar tracks, follow such simple commands as to go forward 5, turn right 90, and then forward 2. These simple joys would be lost on the children of today, but back then it was the very pinnacle of electronic advances. The advert on TV displayed BigTrack fetching an apple for Dad, and carrying drinks a la R2D2 in Star Wars - Return of the Jedi. It was not merely a toy, but a companion, and a highly desirable item. The rather indelicate hints I had landed had hit home, and my mother did no doubt, set out with all good intentions to buy me my prize. What I did in fact receive was a BigTrack trailer. Mum never really seemed to understand why a trailer without a BigTrack isa disappointment. She tried to sedate me with the half-promise that perhaps next Xmas I might get a BigTrack to pull my Trailer. In fact, in January she stood on my accessory and broke it. I never did receive the vehicle. <br><strong>Christian Stretton </strong></p> <p>My auntie usually sends something rather strange (ballet books for my brother and tank books for me!) but this year was particularly special...she gave me a pepper pot but no salt to match! I wonder if I should ask around the rest of my family to see if someone else has been given the salt cellar, so we can re-unite the set! <br><strong>Colette Healy</strong></p> <p>One year I was lucky enough to get this beautifully wrapped gift from a new(ish) boyfriend. What can it be I thought, chocolates , jewellery, cd player etc.? No. It was a plastic \"can crusher\"! The idea being if you crush your baked bean or soup cans before putting them into your dustbin you can fit more rubbish in the bin. Exciting git, I mean gift, or what? Needless to say our relationship did not blossom! <br><strong>Elaine Henderson </strong></p> <p>My worst ever Christmas gift that I received was this year! Last year my husband walked away with a packet of Biro's from my sister and a book on trains. This year it was his family's turn to surprise me with some interesting gifts. The most notable of which I received with deep thanks from his Nan. The main gift came neatly wrapped in last years paper. As I gently unwrapped the package so as not to \"spoil the paper for next year\" I came across a glimpse of blue material peeping out from behind the offending scent. <br> As I delved further time stood still as I pulled out a blue 1950's half pinny - the sort that housewives with the white picket fences and perfect children might have used to make homebaked cookies. To add insult to injury was the detail on the pinny of a wonderful swirly red and black pattern, which could only be described as \"Margaret Ledbetters' housecoat\". I am a full-time working Mother, I teach, and I have a career. Somewhere here was the message that I should be staying at home. I smiled, said thank you and went upstairs to gently place it into a charity bag along with a collection of other items from Christmas. <br><strong>Sarah Cooper</strong></p> <p>My worst Christmas present was a laced thong and bra set, being male did not help, but all was resolved when I found my brother had mixed up the gift tags. One good thing is that at least I know what my sister in law is wearing or is it? <br><strong>Andy Davies </strong></p> <p>Year before last from work colleagues...the Gary Glitter story on video. <br><strong>Martin Lampen</strong></p> <p>I received a nightie from my boyfriends mum for an age 12-13 girl when I am 24 years old. <br><strong>Lucy Merrick</strong></p> <p>My worst ever Christmas present was a dusty roll-on deodorant from my mother-in-law. It turned out she'd forgotten to buy me a present, so she'd ransacked her bathroom cabinet for some unused bottle or jar. Either she was oblivious to the implied insult orshe just didn't care. The last two years she's given me a set of pink towels (for our blue bathroom) and a necklace that turns my neck green, so I'm beginning to suspect the latter. <br> The very same Christmas my sister-in-law gave me a cafetiere. It was actually quite nice, apart from the sticker indicating that it was a promotional freebie from the company she worked for! It must be some sort of family tradition. <br><strong>Sue Plenty, Belgium</strong> </p> <p>My nan hasn't got much money so when she asked me what I would like for Christmas I said that I would like some razors. Imagine my surprise when on Christmas day I opened up a giant packet of raisins. Mind you I didn't cut myself for a change. <br><strong>Richard Francis</strong></p> <p> 2 particularly bad presents: 1) from my gran a white cabbage accompanied by \"Well you like coleslaw don't you?\" 2) from my auntie a pair of men's ski gloves - I'm female, with very small hands and I've never been skiing in my life. <br><strong>Lucy Batcup </strong></p> <p>Throughout December I had dropped hints to close friends and family that a camera would be an excellent present for me, especially because mine was stolen the previous Christmas. Excitement set in whilst opening presents as one present turned out to be a camera bag, and another a book on photography. The final present lay before me, the right shape and the right size and as I tore off the last shred of wrapping paper I held in my hands, with an ironic pride...a disposable camera !!! <br><strong>Simon Powell </strong></p> <p>The worst gift I ever received was a box of truffles from my Aunt. The problem was, I gave them to her the previous Christmas. She'd kept them in a cupboard for a year, rewrapped it (using the same paper) and gave them back to me - they were past their sell by date! <br><strong>Gerard Egan </strong></p> <p>My nomination is the three pairs of \"Holy Socks\" illustrative of the story of Jonah and the Whale given to me this year by my mother, a Church of Scotland elder. The whale looks more of a slug to me. She assures me that she has sufficient stores of the dratted things (on assorted biblical themes) to be able to make similar gifts, birthdays and Christmases, for the remainder of my natural life. The worst of it is that, through a temporary hiatus in my laundry arrangements, I've actually been forced to wear them. <br><strong>Graeme Smillie</strong></p> <p>My mum's sister bought me a sack truck, yes... a sack truck for Christmas. What is a sack truck, well.... it allows for easy movement of sacks around the garden.... One problem, I have no garden, don't ever have the inclination to buy sacks. Have tried to find other uses for the amazing gift, works wellish as a TV stand, but not on BBC2, antenna causes lines, and have tried unsuccessfully to lend it to friends... Would you like it??? <br><strong>Mark Woods </strong></p> <p>This year I received \u00a350 of clothes vouchers for my daughter - lovely, really useful prezzie you'd think - but they'd expired! <br><strong>Dawn Quadling </strong></p> <p>My husband shot out of the house before having breakfast and was missing for one and a half hours. On his return he wished me happy Christmas, then proceeded to shove a small parcel in my hand. I opened my present and upon first glance threw it in the air shouting at the top of my voice \"kill it\".I thought it was some kind of spider but in fact it was something called an air plant, it was fluffy and kind of hairy and unfortunately the only thing my husband could could buy on Christmas morning from a garden shop. Every year I think how ugly a plucked turkey is but nothing could compare to the strange air plant that I had never seen before and with luck, hoped never to see again. <br><strong>Leigh Addis </strong></p> <p>My worst Christmas present was a knitted scarf, glove and bobble hat set from my grandma. There was nothing wrong with them. Unfortunately I was serving in the infantry in Cyprus so the instruction to 'wrap up warm' was not helpful. The worst was to come - my sargeant thought it was amusing to make me wear the said articles on parade for an entire week and being nicknamed Private Pike. <br><strong>Martin Woodhead </strong></p> <p>I had been dating my husband for about five years. One Christmas I went to his mother's house on Christmas eve and his mother asked me to drive her to the store to pick up some last minute gifts. When we got there she told me I needed to wait in the car because she was buying my gift too. The next morning I opened it up and there was a wallet-sized picture frame with the clearance sticker still on it for $1.77!! <br><strong>Brandie Pettus</strong></p> <p>Woe is me! Being a newly married bloke this was the first Xmas my wife and I had spent together. I had expected a decent present to get over the disappointment of having tons of chinz as wedding presents (thats the trouble with Indian weddings - you get hundreds of guests remotely related to you who fob off their unwanted wedding presents to you by tippexing out their name on stuff like packs of argos student saucers and putting yours on etc.). <br>Anyway, my wife comes from Essex and unfortunately she must think that cuddly toys which stick to car windows are cool and therefore got me a girl and boy holding hands with \"TRUE LOVE\" emblazoned on each torso of the toy - sometimes there is not enough puke in the world.

      "bodyText": "My worst present was my whole Xmas stocking. Two ties (one comedy/musical), one pair of fake Versace pants, and a jar of aubergine pickle. I know I'm a just-turned-30 new dad, but did my wife have to rub it in? Joe Hallgarten The worst Christmas present I ever had was a local history of Auchterarder - a place I've never been to. James Andrew My mother gives two kinds of presents: solid thoughtful ones and small worrying ones. Last year the small worrying presents included parsley-oil breath freshener pills. This year we got several pine-scented car deodorizers and little pillows of cedar shavings. I'm afraid she's trying to tell us something. Martha Bridgegam, USA Had a bit of a run recently... Christmas 1998... Q) What to get for grandad, the man with everything? A) As a last resort, a Body Shop shaving kit. Christmas 1999... the exact same shaving kit, re-wrapped in exactly the same paper is returned to me. Christmas 2000... a brand spanking new B-B-Q... excellent except it was from relatives who have visited my 4th floor, balcony-less, roof-terrace-less apartment... thanks! Chris Raybould Relatives - you've got to love them. No, you've GOT to love them, it's the law, even in the face of the most blatant \"Don't love me\" provocation. My darling auntie, as thoughtful as ever, asked me what I wanted for Xmas. Well, being a young go-ahead kind of a thing, I'd just got hold of a new dinky mobile to keep my cool and social life flowing nicely. \"Something for my new moby, auntie\" I foolishly hinted, forgetting that the devil's in the detail, and expecting a nice new fascia, hands free kit or some such. Come Christmas Day and a nicely wrapped box dropped in my lap from auntie. Ripping open the wrapping with none-too-indecent haste, my eyes alighted on... a piece of plastic. With some blue liquid and two other bits of grey plastic trapped inside, and a gap. Hmm... turning it over, I found the instructions: \"Oil Dolphin Phone Holder\", and next to them a sticker professing the true quality of my gift: \"Made in China\" (no offence to your chinese readers, but come on...). So, there's these two proto-dolphins trapped in blue oily stuff, and a gap for the phone... which is far too big for my new dinky phone, which just slips over every time I try to prop it up to show my new gift doing it's thing. Much as my smile kept slipping every time I tried to convince my aunt that I was pleased with her gift. This 'product' is a true challenge to the taste of the e-Bay audience. Roll on next year... Shashi Desai One of the worst and most soul destroying Christmas presents I ever received was a jar of pickled onions from my grandmother. This is after spending a year cleaning, organising and running the fairly large B&amp;B she owns on the west coast of Scotland.

Amid spiralling anxiety about teacher shortages, this looked disastrous. </p> <p>Eleven days later, the same agency, the Graduate Teacher Training Registry, reported that having counted all the applications received by December 15, there had, in fact, been a 10% rise in post-graduate applications. The Liberal Democrats were sceptical of this \"miracle\" turnaround. The GTTR blamed the slow Christmas post and the early start to the holiday which meant staff finished processing applications on December 22, rather than December 24. </p> <p>That small kerfuffle offers some illustration of the difficulties in assessing the scale of recruitment problems - a rather more perilous exercise than it should be. The most recent government figures show that teacher vacancies are running at an acceptable 0.8%, although with wide regional variation - in inner London vacancies ran at 2.6%. But those figures relate to a census on the third Thursday in January 2000, rather than this year. They also rely on a narrow definition of what a vacancy is; one which unions argue persistently underestimates the true figure. </p> <p>The Department for Education and Employment is sticking to a definition introduced in the early 1990s, that a vacancy is a post which is not covered for less than a term. Which means that a post covered by a teacher on a year's contract cannot be defined as a vacancy, which may be right; less easy to accept that a post covered by a teacher taken on a rush for one term is not vacant. </p> <p>In their report, Attracting Teachers, Alan Smithers and Pamela Robinson at the Centre for Employment Research at Liverpool University question why the DfEE has been able to report generally low levels of vacancies when the government has persistently missed its targets for recruitment to teacher training in secondary schools. </p> <p>They attribute it to the ingenuity of head teachers in juggling timetables, teaching themselves, employing untrained teachers, and bringing in staff from Australasia, Canada and South Africa. There are clearly hundreds of foreign teachers working in the UK; how many exactly is apparently impossible to say. Smithers and Robinson reckon that about one in ten posts fall vacant each year. About half the full-time posts in primary schools and a quarter of those in secondary schools were filled by temporary contracts, mostly of a term or more. And around 50% of schools had difficulty filling posts, say Smithers and Robinson, not only in the south-east but also in places like Cornwall and the West Midlands. </p> <p>Unions do believe the vacancy problem is worse than last year. The Local Government Association says it is not, and that in some parts of the country it may even be better. The government believes that primary schools are generally well covered, but accepts that recruitment may be more difficult this year than last in secondary schools in outer London and the home counties The two leading teacher unions, the NUT and the NASUWT, regard short weeks as a preferable alternative to stretching staff to the limit.

In the 1970s, ministers cut the number of teacher training colleges for non-graduates as the birth rate fell. Post-graduate teacher training places were shaved too, hitting a low in 1983. The pruning went too far, and by the time places started going up again to deal with the rising birth rate, teacher training was competing for space in a much more crowded and confident graduate market. Starting salaries and conditions looked much more attractive in other professions. Since then, only in recession years have secondary school entries kept up with targets. </p> <p>While targets for primary school teachers continued to be met, serious shortfalls in specific secondary subjects began to emerge. Last year, the secondary school trainees fell 13% short; 14,508 compared with a target of 16,615. Even then, there is huge wastage: about 40% of the 30,000 or so who enter teacher training do not enter the classroom. </p> <p> Some 28,700 people have started teacher training this year, 2,250 (9%) more than at the same time last year. It is the first increase since 1992. Since 1997, the number of teachers in English state schools has increased by 5,400; and since 1998, by 7,000. All post-graduates teacher trainees now receive a \u00a36,000 salary. Trainee teachers in the shortage subjects of maths, science, technology and modern languages have receive \"golden hellos\" of \u00a34,000.

Baptist minister Jackson, 59, issued a statement about the 20-month-old child, saying that he had fathered her and had provided \"emotional and financial support since her birth\". He continued: \"I fully accept responsibility and I am truly sorry for my actions\u0085 As her mother does, I love this child very much.\" \"I was born of these circumstances, and I know the importance of growing up in a nurturing, supportive and protected environment. So I am determined to give my daughter and her mother the privacy they both deserve.\" While he refused to reveal their identity, Jackson did state that he would be stepping aside from his public duties for a time. Jackson's New York-based spokesman John Scanlon later revealed that the minister had acted to pre-empt anticipated tabloid reports about the child. Scanlon said the birth was the result of an affair Jackson had with one of his employees in the Washington office of his advocacy group, the Rainbow-PUSH Coalition. The National Enquirer first reported the story. \"This is no time for evasions, denials or alibis,\" Jackson's statement said. \"No doubt, many close friends and supporters will be disappointed in me.

      "bodyText": "Racist incidents reported to the police rose by 107% last year, the Home Office disclosed today. The total number of race crimes spiralled from 23,049 in 1998/99 to nearly 48,000 the following year in England and Wales, a new report shows. In some police forces, the increases were huge - up 459% in West Mercia and 364% in Devon and Cornwall - and none of the 43 forces showed a reduction. A separate report on how police are dealing with race and homophobic crime, and with recruiting ethnic minority staff, found most forces were doing well. However, more effort was needed to end \"complacency regarding this proportionality in the use of stop-and-search tactics\" and in retaining and promoting ethnic minority staff. North Yorkshire was found to be failing in six of the 10 areas examined in the study and City of London police was failing in five. Gwent Police were failing in eight areas, but were rated good in two and satisfactory in one. Meanwhile, the race statistics showed more than 818,000 stop and searches were recorded by police, down from more than 1m the previous year. Police use of stop-and-search tactics - criticised in the Macpherson report into the racist murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence for targeting ethnic minorities more frequently than whites - fell by 40% in the Metropolitan police area and 14% in the rest of England and Wales. Black people were five times more likely to be stopped and searched than whites and four times more likely to be arrested. Nearly 60% of the people arrested by the Met for robbery were black, said the report. Home secretary Jack Straw said that the figures \"reflected the different breakdown of who is committing robbery on the streets of London\". Figures show black people accounted for 57.2% of arrests for robbery in the Met's area compared to an average of 28.2% in the whole of England and Wales. \"In London, there's bound to be a higher proportion of black people stopped for street crime because a higher proportion of black people commit street crime - that is not because they are black but because of their social background, age group and educational attainment,\" said Mr Straw. Commenting on the large rise in recorded race incidents, Home Office statistician Professor Paul Wiles said: \"This increase most probably reflects better reporting and recording of incidents rather than an absolute increase in the numbers. \"The new simplified definition of a racist incident - any incident is racist if perceived to be so by the victim or any other person - may have assisted officers in better identifying such incidents.\" Evidence from the British Crime Survey indicated that racist incidents were falling, he added. Mr Straw said that the sharp rise in the reporting of racial incidents was \"good news\" because it showed an increasing confidence on the part of minorities that their concerns would be dealt with by the police. He told BBC Radio 4's World at One: \"We know from the British Crime Survey that the total amount of racial crime seems to have gone down a bit. \"Why has the recording doubled? Because it shows an increased confidence by the black and Asian population to report these incidents and then have something done about them.\" He dismissed as \"utter nonsense\" suggestions that the recent rise in violent offences was directly linked to a drop in the use of stop-and-search by police wary of being branded racist in the wake of the Macpherson Report. Claims that police were being required to conform to the strictures of \"political correctness\" were a \"smokescreen\" put up by right-wingers who wanted to allege that the police had \"gone soft on the black community\", but did not have the guts to say so openly, he said. He added: \"Robbery has gone up in areas where there are no black people at all. \"It happens that the police division with the highest rate per thousand for robberies is Newcastle upon Tyne Central, where there are virtually no black people. \"There is a problem with robbery and it has got to be dealt with, and where the people committing the robberies happen to be black, the police have got to be able to deal with that as effectively and forcefully as if these people were white.\" Stopping and searching of people about whom police had a reasonable suspicion was backed both by the Home Office and by the Macpherson Report, said Mr Straw.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>BYE BYE, BOS BOS</strong></p> <p>As far as Mark Bosnich was concerned, today was just another day. Same as any other. And so, after crawling out of bed this morning and sitting down to a hearty breakfast of cake swilled down with Alka Seltzer, the lithe Manchester United goalkeeper went about his usual business: cruising slowly to Old Trafford, ambling out onto the pitch to shank a few balls into touch, and then settling down in the corner of the dressing room for a quick snooze under a large pile of warm burger wrappers.</p> <p>But sadly, today was not just another day, and Bosnich would soon find his world crashing down around him faster than a 23-stone goalkeeper under a heavy challenge. Because, once Alex Ferguson had roused him from his post-lunch slumber by poking him from afar with a long pole - do you seriously expect a knight of the realm to touch an antipodean? - Mark realised his time at United was about to come to an abrupt end. And sure enough, one quick one-sided chat later saw the club terminate his contract \"by mutual consent\".</p> <p>\"In doing so, we wish him well for the future!\" a United spokesman bellowed above the snorts and guffaws emanating from the manager's office. But exactly what \"the future\" holds for poor Bos Bos is unclear. It has been said that both Celtic and Monaco are looking for someone to fill their goal, and that's something certainly within the limits of Bosnich's abilities. But these are nothing more than rumours and, in the meantime, everyone's favourite Australian \"athlete\" is unwanted, resigned to a life bereft of hope and direction, where every empty day is as lonely as the next. Either that or he'll sign for Chelsea.</p> <p>***STOP PRESS*** Mark Bosnich has just signed for Chelsea. Gah! There goes his lie-in with breakfast on a tray!</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>GROB SMACKED</strong></p> <p>For a while there, Bruce Grobbelaar must have been pretty chuffed with his lot in life. Living in South Africa, probably with a big gun, he had been awarded \u00a385,000 in libel damages by the High Court and had his name cleared of murky allegations of match-fixing. Indeed, so clear was his name that many people actually thought he had conceded loads of crap goals by accident.</p> <p>Sadly, those same many people are likely to have changed their minds today after the Court of Appeal found in favour of the Sun \"newspaper\" and overturned the libel award. They told Grob he will also have to pay upwards of \u00a3500,000 in costs and told the world they were rectifying \"a miscarriage of justice which this court can, and must, correct\". </p> <p>\"All that had to be decided,\" said Lord Justice Simon Brown, \"was whether Mr Grobbelaar took corrupt payments and, as to that, in my judgment only one rational view was possible, namely that the defendants' allegations were proved true.\" </p> <p>All of which allowed the Sun to crow a bit this morning (we were just as surprised as you are). \"The court has found unanimously and unambiguously in a devastating judgement that Bruce Grobbelaar corruptly accepted bribes to throw football matches,\" said their lawyer, Daniel Taylor. Grob, meanwhile, was \"devastated\" by the ruling and is set to take an appeal to the House of Lords. The Fiver suggests waggling his knees while he does it, it's worked before.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"I know that there is no hope for me at Celtic and I don't even want to continue playing there. Perhaps I will manage to find another club, but in the meantime I am prepared to suffer. I'm not going to give up my chance to make as much money as possible, because in four or five years when my career is over that is all that I will have left. I will not forfeit a single shekel at Celtic\" - Eyal Berkovic speaks frankly from his home in Israel. It'll be a waste of time sending Martin O'Neill a postcard.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>DISNEY DO WELL!</strong></p> <p>Disney have not become the multinational conglomerate that's so close to our hearts without being astute business brains. By changing the name of Eurodisney to Disneyland Paris, they transformed an ailing theme park into one that sounded like it was almost in Florida. By opening their own stores and offering punters across the world the chance to buy plastic Mickey Mouse hats, they changed the face of consumerism as we know it. Undoubtedly Disney are the Walt Disney of our age. So can someone tell the Fiver why they want to hire Celtic?</p> <p>For some reason, it seems that Disneyland - the real, sunny one - want the bowler-hatted Bhoys as a regular attraction. Martin O'Neill's men are currently spending a week's break in the resort (\"Help! Help! Ramon Vega's fallen into Thunder Canyon!\") and the hyperactive Irishman has been using his time to broker deals with Disney's sports marketing executive. \"We spoke about the possibility of some kind of tie-up,\" said O'Neill, jumping up and down on the spot. \"The idea is that we would come out once or twice a season. Nothing has been agreed at this stage but the facilities here are certainly very good.\"</p> <p>So good, in fact, that Ted Turner's Atlanta Braves baseball team has already agreed a 10-year-deal to perform and train in Disneyland's Wide World of Sports complex. Which makes you wonder why they've turned to a bunch of Aston Villa rejects as their next clients. Speaking of Alan Thompson, if a deal goes through it could be worth \u00a33m for the Queen's Own Hoops, roughly the same as what O'Neill paid for the occasionally sharp-shooting midfielder.

      "bodyText": "BYE BYE, BOS BOS As far as Mark Bosnich was concerned, today was just another day. Same as any other. And so, after crawling out of bed this morning and sitting down to a hearty breakfast of cake swilled down with Alka Seltzer, the lithe Manchester United goalkeeper went about his usual business: cruising slowly to Old Trafford, ambling out onto the pitch to shank a few balls into touch, and then settling down in the corner of the dressing room for a quick snooze under a large pile of warm burger wrappers. But sadly, today was not just another day, and Bosnich would soon find his world crashing down around him faster than a 23-stone goalkeeper under a heavy challenge. Because, once Alex Ferguson had roused him from his post-lunch slumber by poking him from afar with a long pole - do you seriously expect a knight of the realm to touch an antipodean? - Mark realised his time at United was about to come to an abrupt end. And sure enough, one quick one-sided chat later saw the club terminate his contract \"by mutual consent\". \"In doing so, we wish him well for the future!\" a United spokesman bellowed above the snorts and guffaws emanating from the manager's office. But exactly what \"the future\" holds for poor Bos Bos is unclear. It has been said that both Celtic and Monaco are looking for someone to fill their goal, and that's something certainly within the limits of Bosnich's abilities. But these are nothing more than rumours and, in the meantime, everyone's favourite Australian \"athlete\" is unwanted, resigned to a life bereft of hope and direction, where every empty day is as lonely as the next. Either that or he'll sign for Chelsea. ***STOP PRESS*** Mark Bosnich has just signed for Chelsea. Gah! There goes his lie-in with breakfast on a tray! * * * * * * * * * * * * * GROB SMACKED For a while there, Bruce Grobbelaar must have been pretty chuffed with his lot in life. Living in South Africa, probably with a big gun, he had been awarded \u00a385,000 in libel damages by the High Court and had his name cleared of murky allegations of match-fixing. Indeed, so clear was his name that many people actually thought he had conceded loads of crap goals by accident. Sadly, those same many people are likely to have changed their minds today after the Court of Appeal found in favour of the Sun \"newspaper\" and overturned the libel award. They told Grob he will also have to pay upwards of \u00a3500,000 in costs and told the world they were rectifying \"a miscarriage of justice which this court can, and must, correct\". \"All that had to be decided,\" said Lord Justice Simon Brown, \"was whether Mr Grobbelaar took corrupt payments and, as to that, in my judgment only one rational view was possible, namely that the defendants' allegations were proved true.\" All of which allowed the Sun to crow a bit this morning (we were just as surprised as you are). \"The court has found unanimously and unambiguously in a devastating judgement that Bruce Grobbelaar corruptly accepted bribes to throw football matches,\" said their lawyer, Daniel Taylor. Grob, meanwhile, was \"devastated\" by the ruling and is set to take an appeal to the House of Lords. The Fiver suggests waggling his knees while he does it, it's worked before. * * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"I know that there is no hope for me at Celtic and I don't even want to continue playing there. Perhaps I will manage to find another club, but in the meantime I am prepared to suffer. I'm not going to give up my chance to make as much money as possible, because in four or five years when my career is over that is all that I will have left. I will not forfeit a single shekel at Celtic\" - Eyal Berkovic speaks frankly from his home in Israel. It'll be a waste of time sending Martin O'Neill a postcard. * * * * * * * * * * * * * DISNEY DO WELL! Disney have not become the multinational conglomerate that's so close to our hearts without being astute business brains. By changing the name of Eurodisney to Disneyland Paris, they transformed an ailing theme park into one that sounded like it was almost in Florida. By opening their own stores and offering punters across the world the chance to buy plastic Mickey Mouse hats, they changed the face of consumerism as we know it. Undoubtedly Disney are the Walt Disney of our age. So can someone tell the Fiver why they want to hire Celtic? For some reason, it seems that Disneyland - the real, sunny one - want the bowler-hatted Bhoys as a regular attraction. Martin O'Neill's men are currently spending a week's break in the resort (\"Help! Help! Ramon Vega's fallen into Thunder Canyon!\") and the hyperactive Irishman has been using his time to broker deals with Disney's sports marketing executive. \"We spoke about the possibility of some kind of tie-up,\" said O'Neill, jumping up and down on the spot. \"The idea is that we would come out once or twice a season. Nothing has been agreed at this stage but the facilities here are certainly very good.\" So good, in fact, that Ted Turner's Atlanta Braves baseball team has already agreed a 10-year-deal to perform and train in Disneyland's Wide World of Sports complex. Which makes you wonder why they've turned to a bunch of Aston Villa rejects as their next clients. Speaking of Alan Thompson, if a deal goes through it could be worth \u00a33m for the Queen's Own Hoops, roughly the same as what O'Neill paid for the occasionally sharp-shooting midfielder. It's been said before, and it'll be said again, but God Bless Disney! * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Bradford want Newcastle winger Stephen Glass. Bobby Robson may consider an offer from the Bantams as Glass will be available for nothing at the end of the season. Bayern Munich are ready to offer Sol Campbell an \u00a380,000-a-week tax-free package to join them next season.

Boca Juniors vice-president Roberto Digon claims Arsenal have been told they can have Cordoba for \u00a32.7m. \"The English club Arsenal are evaluating the options for the position, and one of those is Cordoba, who is available for $4m,\" Digon said.

I know that Beckham would be a great success in Spain.\" Leicester have completed the signing of former Italian international striker Roberto Mancini on a short-term basis. Christian Dailly this morning completed his \u00a31.75m move from Blackburn to West Ham. Brentford are to leave Griffin Park, their home of 97 years, and are looking for a possible ground-sharing option. Ian Bishop will decide this weekend whether to leave Manchester City for Barnsley, Sheffield Wednesday or Miami Fusion. Tommy Wright has been offered a one-year player-coaching role at Manchester City next season. The Northern Ireland goalkeeper, who has just joined Bolton for three months on loan, would have been out of contract this summer.

In an open letter to Khamenei, the student-led Office for Fostering Unity claimed that the supreme leader was trampling the people's freedoms.</p> <p>\"Our main concern is freedom and justice. We don't want to taste oppression and remain silent,\" the group said.</p> <p>Among Iran's fast growing population, the majority of people is too young to remember the revolution. As the ranks of these younger generations expand, pressure is growing - especially from women - for a relaxation of the strict Islamic social codes imposed by Khomenei, and for greater democracy and transparency in public affairs.</p> <p>The symbol and leader of this movement for change is Iran's President, Mohammad Khatami, whose election in 1997 heralded the beginning of the present struggle for reform.</p> <p>While upholding Islamic values and bowing to Khamenei's spiritual leadership, Khatami has sought to create a law-based civil society and to end Iran's self-imposed isolation from the outside world, in particular the West.</p> <p>But Khatami's powers are severely circumscribed. He has been forced onto the defensive in recent months. Now he faces increasing discontent among his own youthful supporters at his perceived failure to deliver and at parliament's similar impotence.</p> <p>This week's jail sentences have been seen as yet more evidence that Khatami cannot protect his own.</p> <p>Khatami admits there is a problem. He has expressed his frustrations at the pace of reform and at interventions by Khamenei in the political sphere - such as his insistence on the dismissal of the popular, liberal culture minister, Ataollah Mohajerani.</p> <p>Speculation has thus begun to grow that he may not run for a second term this June. Without the moderate and level-headed Khatami at the helm, however, there are fears that public frustration at the clerics' stranglehold on Iranian society could spill over into street violence and unrest (as has happened sporadically in the past two years).</p> <p>Perhaps the most famous opponent of the mullahs is Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri. He could provide a new rallying point for reformers if Khatami gives up the fight.

Those imprisoned included Mehrangiz Kar, a leading lawyer and advocate of women's rights, and Akbar Ganji, an investigative reporter who embarrassed the regime by linking Islamic hardliners to the unexplained murders of dissidents. The accused were charged with anti-state activities after attending a conference in Berlin last year sponsored by the Heinrich B\u00f6ll Foundation. The meeting's theme was \"post-elections Iran\", and involved a discussion of the implications of last spring's landslide Majlis (parliament) victory by reform parties. But far from bringing an opening of Iranian society, the reformers' advances have since provoked a reactionary backlash by the clerical establishment that is guided by Iran's supreme spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Khamenei is the principal guardian of the legacy of the late Ayatollah Khomenei and the 1979 revolution that toppled the Shah. He and his supporters continue to wield the main levers of power, including control of the judiciary, the police and armed forces, and the media.

The arrests and trials \"represent a setback for human rights and a clear violation of the individual's right to freedom of expression and association,\" spokesman Richard Boucher said. Within Iran itself, student groups - among the most vocal of the regime's critics - added their voices to the protests. In an open letter to Khamenei, the student-led Office for Fostering Unity claimed that the supreme leader was trampling the people's freedoms. \"Our main concern is freedom and justice. We don't want to taste oppression and remain silent,\" the group said. Among Iran's fast growing population, the majority of people is too young to remember the revolution. As the ranks of these younger generations expand, pressure is growing - especially from women - for a relaxation of the strict Islamic social codes imposed by Khomenei, and for greater democracy and transparency in public affairs. The symbol and leader of this movement for change is Iran's President, Mohammad Khatami, whose election in 1997 heralded the beginning of the present struggle for reform. While upholding Islamic values and bowing to Khamenei's spiritual leadership, Khatami has sought to create a law-based civil society and to end Iran's self-imposed isolation from the outside world, in particular the West. But Khatami's powers are severely circumscribed. He has been forced onto the defensive in recent months. Now he faces increasing discontent among his own youthful supporters at his perceived failure to deliver and at parliament's similar impotence. This week's jail sentences have been seen as yet more evidence that Khatami cannot protect his own. Khatami admits there is a problem. He has expressed his frustrations at the pace of reform and at interventions by Khamenei in the political sphere - such as his insistence on the dismissal of the popular, liberal culture minister, Ataollah Mohajerani. Speculation has thus begun to grow that he may not run for a second term this June. Without the moderate and level-headed Khatami at the helm, however, there are fears that public frustration at the clerics' stranglehold on Iranian society could spill over into street violence and unrest (as has happened sporadically in the past two years). Perhaps the most famous opponent of the mullahs is Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri. He could provide a new rallying point for reformers if Khatami gives up the fight. Trouble is, he, too, is currently under arrest.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the story of the Kilshaws' adoption of the girls and their fight to smuggle them out of America could be made into a Hollywood movie. Mr Kilshaw told the Express that he had begun talks with Hollywood film studios. He is quoted as saying: \"I told the studio bosses, 'Let's get it on!' I really want to see this movie made. \"We were contacted on Tuesday night and they say they want to look at the possibility of turning our story into a movie. And they, like us, are very keen to make sure that happens. I think it would make a great film and I see no reason why that shouldn't happen.\" Mr Kilshaw also said he was taking legal advice about whether he could take court action to recover some of the \u00a324,000 the couple spent getting the girls out of America. He told the Express he and his wife incurred extra expenses because of the way Ms Johnson, of the Caring Heart Agency, had handled the adoption. A third set of parents has also come forward to say they were offered the twin girls by Ms Johnson. Amy and Eddie White, from New York State, agreed to pay her \u00a35,800, but the deal collapsed when they failed to produce the money quickly enough, the Sun reported.

The Asian satellite TV broadcaster went live in the UK this week without Kaun Banega Crorepati? - or Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? - on its schedule, leaving the station's biggest hit on the sidelines. \"Certainly the issue is that we are a licensee of the format for parts of Asia, but it is not a blanket agreement. It is simply a question of not having the rights and we are talking to all the relevant parties about it,\" said James Murdoch, son of Rupert and chief executive of Star TV. Celador, the UK production outfit that owns the rights to Millionaire, will not allow licensees to broadcast the programme outside the country it is made in. So far ITV, holder of the UK licence, has resisted any change in the terms and today said there was little chance of Star TV getting its way. \"Star TV will not be able to show its version, as ITV needs to protect its contractual position,\" said an ITV spokeswoman. However, she added that there was a small chance that ITV would broadcast Millionaire on its ITV2 channel if there was demand from the Asian community. The success of the Indian Millionaire, which is hosted by Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan, has been the key to Star TV's dominance of the ratings in India. Mr Murdoch's BSkyB will carry the Star Plus Hindi entertainment channel and 24-hour Star News channel on its digital network, charging \u00a316 per month for both channels. There are no plans as yet to offer the service on rival networks such as ONdigital and NTL. Star will be seeking to repeat its performance in India and knock close rival Zee TV from the top of the UK market, which has a potential audience of around 1.5m Indian and South Asian viewers. \"Our product is of a much higher quality than Zee's.

The sheer scale of the Tory operation demoralised Labour.</p> <p>The size of Mr Wheeler's gift, coupled with the trio of \u00a32m donations to Labour, is bound to sharpen calls for the state funding of political parties.

The firm took tax-free bets on the price of gold, and since then the business has diversified into all the leading commodities, stock indices and sport.</p> <p>The recent addition of betting on individual shares allowed the firm to treble annual profits to \u00a310.1m. The company also takes bets on politics. When the company floated in July on the stock market shares were 240p. Since then the price has more than doubled.</p> <p>In 1998 the company's internet division launched the first site to offer online spread betting and that has become one of its main arms. Last year turnover rose 58% to \u00a315.8m.</p> <p>Despite his faith in the Tories, Mr Wheeler is a shrewd gambler and in the last election put his money on the Labour party. He is also a former finalist in the world poker championships.</p> <p>Mr Wheeler is also on the national council of Business for Sterling.</p> <p><b>Related stories</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/theissues/article/0,6512,419530,00.html\">The issue explained: party funding</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Tories/story/0,7369,423897,00.html\">Tory glee at \u00a35m gift</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Tories/story/0,7369,423891,00.html\">Tories accused over religious drive</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Tories/story/0,7369,423924,00.html\">The player who bet \u00a35m on Hague</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.igindex.co.uk/\" target=\"new\">IG Index</a><br><a href=\"http://www.public-standards.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Committee on Standards in Public Life</a><br><a href=\"http://www.labour.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Labour party</a><br><a href=\"http://www.conservatives.com\" target=\"_new\">Conservative party</a><br><a href=\"http://www.no-euro.com/\" target=\"_new\">Business for Sterling</a></p>",

The money, from Stuart Wheeler, the 65-year-old head of the IG betting index, is said to come without strings and was prompted by his \"admiration\" for the Tory leader, William Hague. The move takes political parties another step away from funding by ordinary memberships and small-scale voluntary donations.

If, as expected, the Labour government imposes a \u00a315m ceiling on election campaign spending, Mr Wheeler's largesse will cover a third of the Conservatives' election expenditure. Mr Wheeler - who floated his betting firm for \u00a3145m in July - said last night: \"I think William Hague would make a much better prime minister than Tony Blair.

His donation gives a boost to the Conservatives following polls that showed them trailing Labour by as much as 15 points. Mr Hague and Mr Wheeler have met but are not described as being close personal friends. \"Clearly this was a very friendly act, and they will become close friends,\" said a senior Tory MP involved in talks with Mr Wheeler. IG, which makes spreads on the financial markets and sporting events, is predicting that the Tories will win 212 to 220 seats in the next election, giving Labour a clear winning majority with between 372 and 380 seats. At the time of his company's flotation, Mr Wheeler took out \u00a35m but retained a one-third stake in the firm valued at \u00a341m. Although the government is imposing a spending cap on election campaign expenditure, parties still badly need cash to run their day-to-day operations, as well as to fund pre-election campaigning such as the current poster campaign being undertaken by the Conservatives. Up until the 1997 election, the Tories managed to massively outspend Labour in elections with a bombardment of posters and newspaper adverts. The sheer scale of the Tory operation demoralised Labour. The size of Mr Wheeler's gift, coupled with the trio of \u00a32m donations to Labour, is bound to sharpen calls for the state funding of political parties. Tony Blair has said he is personally opposed to state funding, largely because he believes it would be politically unpopular. However, the Labour general secretary, Margaret McDonagh, has said that she thinks there is a case for state funding. The parliamentary Labour party chairman, Clive Soley, is also a supporter. Mr Wheeler was educated at Eton and Oxford before joining the Welsh Guards and then qualifying as a barrister. He started his firm with a \u00a35,000 loan in 1974. The firm took tax-free bets on the price of gold, and since then the business has diversified into all the leading commodities, stock indices and sport. The recent addition of betting on individual shares allowed the firm to treble annual profits to \u00a310.1m. The company also takes bets on politics. When the company floated in July on the stock market shares were 240p. Since then the price has more than doubled. In 1998 the company's internet division launched the first site to offer online spread betting and that has become one of its main arms. Last year turnover rose 58% to \u00a315.8m. Despite his faith in the Tories, Mr Wheeler is a shrewd gambler and in the last election put his money on the Labour party. He is also a former finalist in the world poker championships. Mr Wheeler is also on the national council of Business for Sterling.

      "bodyText": "The BBC is promising to increase the money it spends annually on original UK children's programming by \u00a330m to supply output for its two new children's services. The pre-school service has been allocated \u00a320m in its first two years, while the channel for six to 13-year-olds will get \u00a362m over the same period. By comparison, the BBC spent \u00a355m on children's programming in 1999-2000. The BBC is promising to spend 75% of this money on UK-originated programming. The pre-school channel is expected to be the first of the BBC's four proposed new digital TV services on-air, with a launch date pencilled in for the summer. The pre-school service is targeted at children under six and will broadcast during the day on the same channel as BBC3 between 6am and 7pm. The new Children's BBC pre-school offering will carry 90% British programming, a quarter of which will be new material. The BBC is promising \"selective\" use of library shows such as Teletubbies and Tweenies, plus a \"much greater proportion\" of British programming and educational output than its commercial competitors. It will \"offer a range of new high quality UK-produced educative and entertaining programmes for young children\" according to the BBC. \"The service will provide a consistently safe environment for the youngest audience, enhanced by the availability over time of an interactive television wrap around service.\" The second CBBC service is aimed at six to 13-year-olds and is pencilled in for a launch in early 2002, with around 75% British programming. A quarter of the schedule will be new programming, with a further 50% made up of repeated CBBC1 and 2 output and CBBC archive material. This service will broadcast on BBC4's bandwidth, 7am-8pm, \"with a broadly interactive agenda\". The BBC said the older children's service \"will offer new UK-produced drama, comedy, entertainment and factual programmes with the best of current CBBC output\". Live Newsround bulletins will feature \"at least three times a day\" and a Newsround interactive service and children's rolling news website are also being developed. The BBC said: \"Connecting with children through the various means at their disposal - letter, phone, email, SMS messaging and web-based communities - will be at the heart of the channel's purpose and an interactive live 'core' to the channel will create a service that children can truly call their own.\"",

      "bodyText": "The court of appeal today overturned an \u00a385,000 libel award made to former Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar over newspaper allegations accusing him of match-fixing. A panel of judges sitting at the appeal court in London ruled in favour of an appeal brought by the Sun newspaper. The ruling means Mr Grobbelaar stands to lose the original \u00a385,000 and also faces the prospect of a legal bill estimated to be well in excess of \u00a31.5m. Costs awarded against the Sun after the libel verdict last year were put at \u00a3900,000. Appeal costs will add several hundred thousand to that. Mr Grobbelaar, a former Zimbabwe goalkeeper, won the libel damages after a high court jury held that a series of articles in 1994 accusing him of matchfixing was libellous. But in December last year the Sun appealed, with its lawyer Richard Spearman accusing Mr Grobbelaar of lying over taped interviews which he said backed the paper's claims. \"The defendants say that sadly the badges of dishonesty and corruption belong to Bruce Grobbelaar because he is condemned out of his own mouth on the admissions made on the tapes,\" Mr Spearman told the appeal court. Mr Grobbelaar, 43, brought his libel action against the Sun after he was acquitted of conspiracy to fix football matches in a criminal trial. The goalkeeper, along with the ex-Wimbledon players Hans Segers and John Fashanu and the businessman Richard Lim, was cleared in a 1997 re-trial after the first court action ended in deadlock. After reviewing in detail the evidence heard at the high court hearing, Lord Justice Simon Brown said: \"I come at last to consider the probabilities of the case, and it is at this point that, to my mind, Mr Grobbelaar's story falls apart. \"He had, as it seems to me, just too much to explain away - his entire dealings with Mr Lim, his remarkable visits to Manchester and to London, his large cash transactions at around the time of the Liverpool-Newcastle match, his confessions on tape ...\" He added: \"There are simply too many improbabilities piled one upon another inherent in Mr Grobbelaar's case for it to begin to be credible. \"His whole account of his relationship and dealings with Mr Lim beggars belief at every turn.\" Daniel Taylor, company solicitor for The Sun's publishers News International, said later that the historic ruling was without precedent. \"For the first time in English legal history, a jury verdict in a libel action has been set aside on appeal on the grounds that it was perverse and unreasonable and, in the words of the judgment, an affront and a miscarriage of justice.\" Mr Taylor added: \"He stands today condemned by three of the nation's most senior judges as a man who betrayed his team mates, his fans and the national game. \"It has been over six years since the Sun first exposed his duplicity, but today that investigation has been fully vindicated.\" Lord Justice Simon Brown said that he had \"some misgiving\" about allowing the appeal on the defence of justification. \"That, however, is not because I entertain the least doubt about Mr Grobbelaar's guilt, but rather because, as I earlier observed, the court must inevitably be reluctant to find a jury's verdict perverse and anxious not to usurp their function.\" He said it would have been easy to reject the newspaper's challenge on the basis that the issue was one for the jury. \"Some, no doubt, will say that that is the decision we should have reached.

      "bodyText": "Scotland Yard have suspended one of their highest ranking ethnic minority officers over allegations of misconduct. Superintendent Ali Dizaei faces a \"significant number\" of allegations that police say cover a range of internal disciplinary and criminal issues. Mr Dizaei is legal advisor to the National Black Police Association and was based at Kensington and Chelsea station in London. This morning's suspension is said by Scotland Yard sources to be one of the most challenging issues to face the force in the post-Macpherson era. A spokesman said that the allegations cover matters of dishonesty, attempting to pervert the course of justice, personal misconduct and integrity. Mr Dizaei was formally suspended this morning, following an eight-month internal investigation. He joined the Met two years ago from the Thames Valley force and is a trained lawyer. Mr Dizaei was unavailable for comment. The Met say that they have voluntarily referred the case to the Police Complaints Authority. Mr Dizaei hit the headlines in 1999 when he accused the police service of \"ethnic cleansing\" black and Asian candidates. Testing procedures used to pick senior ranks were \"culturally biased\", he said. The Iranian-born law graduate recently criticised Home Secretary Jack Straw for reinstating a PC who called a teenager a \"black bastard\" during a struggle to arrest him.

      "bodyText": "The Panorama reporter responsible for exposing the Omagh bombing suspects has launched a scathing attack on the dearth of investigative journalism on British television. John Ware, who made the acclaimed Who Bombed Omagh? documentary last autumn, berated programme controllers and TV audiences for neglecting truly penetrative investigations that reveal how the country is run. \"There are fewer and fewer truly tough-minded TV investigations - the kind that take significant amounts of time, money and tenacity,\" he said. Mr Ware's attack will add to concern that even so-called \"investigative\" series, such as BBC's popular McIntyre Undercover, tend to favour style over substance. Meanwhile, the BBC is launching another personality-led investigative series, fronted by Panorama reporter Paul Kenyon, while Sky recently announced it was forming an investigative news unit. Mr Ware said: \"A lot of TV journalism which calls itself investigative is now focused on consumer affairs - which is not that testing - or involves hidden cameras which occasionally produce programmes of some importance but also many which are of no importance. \"Some are very watchable but ultimately more sexy than significant,\" he added. Mr Ware also criticised the media for failing to fight back against government spin and corporate PR. \"The leakage of reality - the political, commercial and administrative presentation of events as opposed to the way they really are - is the great sickness of the age,\" he said. Who Bombed Omagh? was seen by over 4m people and was the last Panorama to be shown in its Monday peaktime slot before it move to late Sunday nights. Mr Ware's naming of the four men who are suspected of the bombing was the conclusion of a gruelling and ambitious five-month investigation. \"If television invested more in investigations like these we might make audiences more enquiring and revive interest in current affairs,\" said Mr Ware.",

An extra \u00a3235m has been set aside for new programming for the two channels over the next two years. In addition, shows made for the new digital services will be repeated on the main channels. \"The 70% of households who have not yet switched to digital receivers will therefore also benefit from the BBC's investment in new digital services,\" the corporation argued. \"Investment by the BBC in its digital services will remain a modest proportion of overall BBC spending - less than 15%.\" The BBC has also set out how it believes each of the proposed new digital TV services will be distinct from what commercial broadcasters already offer. Arts and culture channel BBC4 \"will feature a far wider and more ambitious range of subject matter than either [commercial rivals] Artsworld or Performance Channel, including science, business, social issues, philosophy, politics and global affairs\". The BBC also emphasised that its proposed new children's services \"are not designed to replace existing commercial channels for children\", but to complement them in pay-TV homes and ensure \"services for children are also available to those who cannot or do not wish to pay subscriptions\".

The crew-only Air France Concorde flight took off without incident from Paris's Charles de Gaulle airport, bound for a military aviation base at Istres, southern France. Half a dozen fire engines and at least one ambulance stood by as the plane took off, watched by Concorde enthusiasts lining the runway fence. At the base, engineers will simulate fuel leaks on the underside of one of the aircraft's wings, as part of the work needed to bring Concorde back into passenger service and to better understand the chain of events that led to last year's crash. A fuel-tank fire triggered by flying debris from a gashed tyre caused Air France Concorde flight AF4590 to crash near Paris on 25 July last year. All 109 people on board and four on the ground were killed. The disaster prompted safety investigations into the ageing Concorde fleet. Until today, no Air France Concorde has flown since the accident and British Airways' seven-strong Concorde fleet has also been grounded since mid-August. British Airways and Air France have joined forces to develop and test new safety measures for the planes. The ground work at Istres complements tests being carried out on BA Concordes at London's Heathrow airport. This week, BA began outfitting one of its Concordes with liners made from material used in bullet-proof vests, designed to contain fuel if the plane's wing is ruptured. Within eight to 10 weeks, it is hoped a BA Concorde will be ready to take a test flight.

      "body": "<p>MPs last night endorsed overwhelmingly a total ban on fox hunting, paving the way for a confrontation with the Lords which will spill over into the general election campaign.</p> <p>MPs voted by 399 to 155 to reject the option of keeping the status quo, a result that tallied closely with the 411 to 151 vote to ban fox hunting when MPs in November 1997 gave a second reading to Michael Foster's private member's bill.</p> <p>A further proposal to have hunting regulated through a licensing system was rejected by 382 to 182 votes.</p> <p>Tony Blair again told MPs he opposed fox hunting but signalled his uneasiness at the wider politics of a ban by missing the vote, flying instead to Belfast in a bid to revive the peace process.</p> <p>But earlier Mr Blair gave a veiled warning to peers not to defy the Commons. He said: \"We will wait and see what happens in the other house.\"</p> <p>The MPs' decision last night came as hundreds of fox hunters held rallies around the country and vowed to defy the law if a ban is imposed.</p> <p>The bill will go into committee for detailed scrutiny and then pass to the Lords by the end of February. Peers are expected to vote for a middle way option of state licensed hunts backed by a legally enforceable code of conduct.</p> <p>It is unlikely that MPs would then have time to overturn the Lords before March 29, the last date on which parliament can sit prior to the expected May 3 election.</p> <p>The Tory leader in the Lords, Lord Strathclyde, confirmed that the bill had little chance of reaching the statute book before the election.</p> <p>He promised: \"When the bill reaches the House of Lords, it will be subjected to the same scrutiny as any other government bill. No bill, not even the shortest and least controversial one, can normally pass the Lords in less than six to seven weeks from when it leaves the Commons,\" he said.</p> <p>\"That means that if there is an election called for April or May this bill has no chance of becoming law, for timing reasons alone.\"</p> <p>Jockeying has already started in the Labour high command over the wording of the manifesto commitment on a ban. Labour faces a choice between offering another free vote backed by government time, or promising to invoke the Parliament Act and so short-circuit further opposition from peers.</p> <p>In the Commons the Tories attacked Labour for showing a warped set of priorities. David Lidington, the shadow home affairs spokesman, said: \"In my view a ban would criminalise thousands of law-abiding citizens and do nothing to improve animal welfare.\"</p> <p><b>Related stories</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/hunt/Story/0,2763,423787,00.html\">Emotions runs high</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/hunt/Story/0,2763,423798,00.html\">Weary, defiant riders find the going hard</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/hunt/Story/0,2763,423885,00.html\">Unintelligable in pursuit of the debatable</a><br><a href=\"http://talk.guardianunlimited.co.uk/WebX?13@@.ee7e1cf\">Talk about it</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "MPs last night endorsed overwhelmingly a total ban on fox hunting, paving the way for a confrontation with the Lords which will spill over into the general election campaign. MPs voted by 399 to 155 to reject the option of keeping the status quo, a result that tallied closely with the 411 to 151 vote to ban fox hunting when MPs in November 1997 gave a second reading to Michael Foster's private member's bill. A further proposal to have hunting regulated through a licensing system was rejected by 382 to 182 votes. Tony Blair again told MPs he opposed fox hunting but signalled his uneasiness at the wider politics of a ban by missing the vote, flying instead to Belfast in a bid to revive the peace process. But earlier Mr Blair gave a veiled warning to peers not to defy the Commons. He said: \"We will wait and see what happens in the other house.\" The MPs' decision last night came as hundreds of fox hunters held rallies around the country and vowed to defy the law if a ban is imposed. The bill will go into committee for detailed scrutiny and then pass to the Lords by the end of February. Peers are expected to vote for a middle way option of state licensed hunts backed by a legally enforceable code of conduct. It is unlikely that MPs would then have time to overturn the Lords before March 29, the last date on which parliament can sit prior to the expected May 3 election. The Tory leader in the Lords, Lord Strathclyde, confirmed that the bill had little chance of reaching the statute book before the election. He promised: \"When the bill reaches the House of Lords, it will be subjected to the same scrutiny as any other government bill. No bill, not even the shortest and least controversial one, can normally pass the Lords in less than six to seven weeks from when it leaves the Commons,\" he said. \"That means that if there is an election called for April or May this bill has no chance of becoming law, for timing reasons alone.\" Jockeying has already started in the Labour high command over the wording of the manifesto commitment on a ban. Labour faces a choice between offering another free vote backed by government time, or promising to invoke the Parliament Act and so short-circuit further opposition from peers. In the Commons the Tories attacked Labour for showing a warped set of priorities. David Lidington, the shadow home affairs spokesman, said: \"In my view a ban would criminalise thousands of law-abiding citizens and do nothing to improve animal welfare.\" Related stories Emotions runs high Weary, defiant riders find the going hard Unintelligable in pursuit of the debatable Talk about it",

Its proposals were submitted to the government today for approval as part of a statutory consultation process. In total, BBC director general Greg Dyke is proposing a \u00a3313m investment in four new digital TV services and five digital radio services between April 2001 and March 2003, subject to the approval of culture secretary Chris Smith. Nearly half the money - \u00a3152m - will go to BBC3, the youth-oriented TV channel due to relaunch from the ashes of BBC Choice towards the end of this year. BBC4, the highbrow arts and culture channel that has been described as the Radio 3 and Radio 4 of TV, will get \u00a357m over the next two years. This is a fraction of the current \u00a389m annual budget of Radio 4 and the \u00a364m Radio 3 gets. The new service is due to replace BBC Knowledge on digital cable, satellite and terrestrial networks before the end of 2001. The lengthy proposals also reveal that the BBC is planning to launch one of its planned children's services as early as this summer. This is despite howls of protest from the commercial sector, which claims that the BBC should not be allowed use licence-payers money on services already provided by channels such as Nickelodeon and Disney. The BBC has set aside \u00a382m for two new children's TV channels. One is a pre-school service for children under six and is slated to go on air in mid 2001, with a second service for six to 13-year-olds due to launch early next year. In addition, the BBC is proposing to invest \u00a322m over the next two years in five new digital radio services, including a music service aimed at a young black audience, a new best of BBC speech radio station, an Asian network and Five Live Sports Plus. A BBC spokesman said: \"We believe that our new television and radio service proposals will provide a distinctive but complementary alternative to commercial services. \"The proposals will add substantially to viewers' and listeners' choice, with a wide range of high quality British-made programmes, universally available and free to people with digital equipment,\" he added.

      "bodyText": "Health minister Alan Milburn faces another challenge to his health and social care bill today after a Department of Health committee attacked his proposals to reform the provision of family doctor services as \"flawed\" and \"outdated\". The medical practices committee (MPC), which ensures the fair distribution of GPs across the NHS, has warned Mr Milburn that its proposed abolition will pitch health authorities into a chaotic scramble to recruit scarce doctors. The MPC, whose abolition is likely to be debated by MPs in the Commons today, said the removal of national controls over GP distribution will lead to \"an open market for a scarce commodity\". The row over the abolition of the MPC - which both the British Medical Association and the Royal College of GPs oppose - follows widespread criticism last week of the government's plans to replace community health councils. MPC chairwoman Ro Day has written to Mr Milburn saying his justification for abolishing the committee is outdated and that latest data gives the lie to his claim that the current system has led to a shortage of GPs in deprived areas in the north of England. Mrs Day claims that Mr Milburn misled MPs last week when he claimed there were \"50% more GPs in Kingston and Richmond or Oxfordshire than there are in Barnsley and Sunderland\". She says: \"Using up-to-date figures there will now be proportionally more GPs in both Sunderland and Barnsley than in either Kingston and Richmond or Oxfordshire.\" She adds: \"I am writing to express my serious concern that incorrect and misleading information is being presented as justification for the proposed abolition of the medical practices committee.\" The government is determined to correct what it sees as a historical bias in GP distribution that has led what it has claimed is an over-provision of family doctor provision in the shires at the expense of Labour's northern and inner-city heartlands. It wants to hand local health authorities and primary care trusts the power to organise their own GP provision through a financial allocations formula. But the MPC argues this will create an inequitable internal market in which health authorities \"battle\" each other to hire doctors - a battle that the wealthiest authorities will win. It says: \"The MPC feels strongly that there should continue to be an over-arching national body empowered to undertake an active role in the management in the equitable national distribution of GPs. \"Over its 52-year stewardship of the distribution of general medical practitioners, the MPC has made a valuable and important contribution towards achieving equity in the distribution of doctors Distributing GPs according to a financial allocations formula can only create an open market for a scarce commodity. \"Health authorities may well be able to attract GPs to their under-doctored areas through the offer of enhanced financial packages, but with a finite number of GPs available, this can only be at the expense of other areas.\"",

The MPC's success has been limited by its powers of negative direction, which allow it to declare vacancies in needy areas but not to direct GPs to work there - issues largely centred on socio-economic forces. As the GPC/RCGP response states: \"Successive governments could have created the necessary financial inducements to counter these forces but have failed to do so.\" The government has thrown itself wholeheartedly into the quest for more efficient and innovative working in general practice, via the NHS primary care pilots, but has, as with fundholding, failed to commission any robust research into its effectiveness before rolling out the programme.

A. David Lynch's Blue Velvet B. Bob Rafelson's The King of Marvin Gardens C. John Cassavetes's The Killing of a Chinese Bookie 9. Which featured director, once interviewed by Malcolm on the toilet, commanded the writer to \"come on in. I can deal with two shits at once.\" A. John Huston B. John Ford C. Ingmar Bergman 10. The plot concerns the wife of a political prisoner who tells the man's sick mother that her son is away pursuing a Hollywood career. Malcolm judges it \"one of the most moving commentaries of life under political tyranny that I have ever seen.\" It's one of the lesser known choices on the Century of Film. But which one? A. Ousmane Sembene's Xala B. Ermanno Olmi's The Tree of Wooden Clogs C. Karoly Makk's Love \u0095 We have five copies of the book to give away.

      "trailText": "<p>Prime minister attacks 'deplorable' sale of babies to British couple and promises action to deny recognition of some adoptions.</p>",
      "byline": "John Carvel, Helen Carter  and Duncan Campbell in Los Angeles",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Early legislation to prohibit the \"deplorable\" practice of trading children for adoption was promised by Tony Blair yesterday after the case of the British couple who bought American baby twins through an internet site run by a Californian child broker. </p> <p>The prime minister said a bill in the current parliamentary session would remove bureaucratic obstacles that were hindering adoptions in this country and stop parents bringing in children adopted irregularly abroad. </p> <p>\"I think everyone feels it is absolutely deplorable that children are traded in this way. Adoption should always be about the interests of the child first,\" he told MPs after the issue was raised in the House of Commons by the Tory leader, William Hague. </p> <p>Mr Blair also promised to implement the Adoption (Intercountry) Aspects Act. The act was passed in 1999, but was not brought into force. It could be used to refuse recognition to adoptions conducted abroad in countries that do not comply with the Hague convention which gives protection to children in these circumstances. </p> <p>The prime minister's spokesman said: \"He thinks the whole business is disgusting and shares people's horror that you can buy and sell children as a commodity and end up in a situation where you have got two sets of people who claim to be these children's parents.\" </p> <p>Alan and Judith Kilshaw, the couple who paid thousands of pounds to adopt twin baby girls they found on the internet, said Mr Blair's criticism of their behaviour was unacceptable as they had not broken any laws. </p> <p>Mrs Kilshaw stormed out of a television studio in the middle of a live interview for ITV at lunchtime. </p> <p>She pulled out her earpiece leaving her husband Alan behind. When asked: \"Where do you go from here?\" she replied: \"I go home and clean my house, clean my carpets, get a duster and give it a good Hoover and go through the place.\" She then stood up and said: \"Last comment. I'm not doing any more for you,\" before walking away. </p> <p>She is understood to have been responding to newspaper reports that her farmhouse in Buckley, north Wales, is dirty and unkempt. </p> <p>Mrs Kilshaw already has four other children - two girls Louisa, 22, and Caley, 18, from her first marriage and James, seven, and Rupert, four, from her second marriage. </p> <p>The prime minister's intervention caused a flurry in Whitehall among officials who did not expect adoption legislation until after the election and were still consulting on proposals in a white paper published in December. </p> <p>Adoption charities were puzzled as to why Mr Blair thought legislation was needed so quickly. It is already an offence to trade children for adoption within the UK and the government can refuse recognition to adoptions conducted abroad in countries with slacker standards. </p> <p>Felicity Collier, chief executive of the British Agencies for Adoption and Fostering, said the big political problem was whether to derecognise adoptions in the US. \"The government has to decide: are we going to take the US off the designated list of countries whose adoptions we accept if they do not ratify the Hague convention,\" she said. </p> <p>The FBI is carrying out what is described as a \"preliminary inquiry\" into the adoption, according to a spokeswoman. The inquiry, based at the bureau's Los Angeles office, is likely to focus on the exact circumstances in which the children were handed over and to examine who paid what and to whom. </p> <p>An FBI spokeswoman said that the issue of internet adoption was not the subject of the inquiry as many firms now use the internet to advertise their services in this way. </p> <p>The inquiry comes as concern is being voiced by children's organisations in the US about the growing practice of internet agencies offering babies for adoption. </p> <p>The babies offered are usually from a small group of countries which still have loose adoption laws. They include Guatemala, China, Russia, India and Vietnam. Within the US, there are varying standards on how adoptions are undertaken with some states, such as California, enforcing strict policies of checking that children have not been sold while other states, such as Arkansas, have less stringent laws. </p> <p>Social services in Flintshire, where the Kilshaws live, launched an investigation as soon as they heard of the adoption. On Tuesday, social workers unsuccessfully tried to contact the couple, who were holed up in a hotel near Cheshire giving interviews to journalists. </p> <p>Yesterday, two social workers conducted a preliminary assessment of the children. </p> <p><strong>Related stories</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/leaders/story/0,3604,423698,00.html\">18.01.2001: Leader, Shopping for babies</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,424815,00.html\">18.01.2001: Social services take internet twins into care</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/internetnews/story/0,7369,423875,00.html\">18.01.2001: Blair demands law on internet baby trade</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,423855,00.html\">18.01.2000: Once children are settled, welfare considerations may ensure they stay</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,423308,00.html\">17.01.2001: The route to adoption</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,423306,00.html\">17.01.2001: Difficulties parents face</a></p> <p><strong>Online debate</strong><br><a href=\"http://talk.guardianunlimited.co.uk/WebX?13@@.ee7e12e\">Talk about it</a></p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.abcadoptions.com/index.html\">ABC Adoptions: online adoption resources</a><br><a href=\"http://www.adoption-net.co.uk/faq/faqindex.htm\">Adoption-Net.co.uk</a><br><a href=\"http://www.baaf.org.uk/\">British Agencies for Adoption and Fostering</a><br><a href=\"http://www.doh.gov.uk/adoption/intercountry/index.htm\">Intercountry adoption: Department of Health</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Early legislation to prohibit the \"deplorable\" practice of trading children for adoption was promised by Tony Blair yesterday after the case of the British couple who bought American baby twins through an internet site run by a Californian child broker. The prime minister said a bill in the current parliamentary session would remove bureaucratic obstacles that were hindering adoptions in this country and stop parents bringing in children adopted irregularly abroad. \"I think everyone feels it is absolutely deplorable that children are traded in this way. Adoption should always be about the interests of the child first,\" he told MPs after the issue was raised in the House of Commons by the Tory leader, William Hague. Mr Blair also promised to implement the Adoption (Intercountry) Aspects Act. The act was passed in 1999, but was not brought into force. It could be used to refuse recognition to adoptions conducted abroad in countries that do not comply with the Hague convention which gives protection to children in these circumstances. The prime minister's spokesman said: \"He thinks the whole business is disgusting and shares people's horror that you can buy and sell children as a commodity and end up in a situation where you have got two sets of people who claim to be these children's parents.\" Alan and Judith Kilshaw, the couple who paid thousands of pounds to adopt twin baby girls they found on the internet, said Mr Blair's criticism of their behaviour was unacceptable as they had not broken any laws. Mrs Kilshaw stormed out of a television studio in the middle of a live interview for ITV at lunchtime. She pulled out her earpiece leaving her husband Alan behind. When asked: \"Where do you go from here?\" she replied: \"I go home and clean my house, clean my carpets, get a duster and give it a good Hoover and go through the place.\" She then stood up and said: \"Last comment. I'm not doing any more for you,\" before walking away. She is understood to have been responding to newspaper reports that her farmhouse in Buckley, north Wales, is dirty and unkempt. Mrs Kilshaw already has four other children - two girls Louisa, 22, and Caley, 18, from her first marriage and James, seven, and Rupert, four, from her second marriage. The prime minister's intervention caused a flurry in Whitehall among officials who did not expect adoption legislation until after the election and were still consulting on proposals in a white paper published in December. Adoption charities were puzzled as to why Mr Blair thought legislation was needed so quickly. It is already an offence to trade children for adoption within the UK and the government can refuse recognition to adoptions conducted abroad in countries with slacker standards. Felicity Collier, chief executive of the British Agencies for Adoption and Fostering, said the big political problem was whether to derecognise adoptions in the US. \"The government has to decide: are we going to take the US off the designated list of countries whose adoptions we accept if they do not ratify the Hague convention,\" she said. The FBI is carrying out what is described as a \"preliminary inquiry\" into the adoption, according to a spokeswoman. The inquiry, based at the bureau's Los Angeles office, is likely to focus on the exact circumstances in which the children were handed over and to examine who paid what and to whom. An FBI spokeswoman said that the issue of internet adoption was not the subject of the inquiry as many firms now use the internet to advertise their services in this way. The inquiry comes as concern is being voiced by children's organisations in the US about the growing practice of internet agencies offering babies for adoption. The babies offered are usually from a small group of countries which still have loose adoption laws. They include Guatemala, China, Russia, India and Vietnam. Within the US, there are varying standards on how adoptions are undertaken with some states, such as California, enforcing strict policies of checking that children have not been sold while other states, such as Arkansas, have less stringent laws. Social services in Flintshire, where the Kilshaws live, launched an investigation as soon as they heard of the adoption. On Tuesday, social workers unsuccessfully tried to contact the couple, who were holed up in a hotel near Cheshire giving interviews to journalists. Yesterday, two social workers conducted a preliminary assessment of the children.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>January 2000 - Villa Killer</p> <p> The new Millennium started off in pretty good fashion with two goals in the last five minutes at Newcastle to snatch a point. But that was as good as it got for a while, as the next two games saw us face Aston Villa twice - once in the Worthington Cup quarter-final replay (which we lost 3-1), and then in the league (Paolo Di Canio snatching a point with a late equaliser).</p> <p>Still, spirits were lifted with a comprehensive win at Leicester thanks to a brace from Paolo Wanchope - his first league goals since November.</p> <p><strong>February - It's Frank v Paolo! </strong></p> <p>There were only three games in February - which brought a total of sixteen goals. Unfortunately 10 of those were in our end!</p> <p>Gary Charles got his Hammers career off to a flyer with a last-gasp oggie at Southampton to gift Hoddle's disciples all three points. But the Hammers came back to win an extraordinary match at Upton Park against Bradford 5-4 - a game which saw Frank Lampard and Paolo Di Canio literally fighting over the ball for the right to take a penalty. Needless to say Di Canio won.</p> <p>The month ended with a 4-0 defeat at home to Everton - most notable for the worst goalkeeping debut ever witnessed at Upton Park, thanks to Sasa Ilic who had joined on loan from Charlton as injury cover.</p> <p><strong>March - Goal of the Season</strong></p> <p>With the Hammers Euro hopes faltering, the team put on a spirited burst during March which saw us gain 10 points from a possible 15. Consecutive wins against Watford and Southampton were followed by a disappointing defeat at doomed Sheffield Wednesday and a bore draw at home to Chelsea. March probably summed up the season - good in patches but too inconsistent to mount a serious challenge for a European spot.</p> <p>However, the month ended in spectacular fashion. Not the result - a fairly reasonable 2-1 win over Wimbledon - but Paolo Di Canio's stunning volley which rightly earned him the award for Goal of the Season. </p> <p><strong>April - April Fools</strong></p> <p>When the 99/00 fixture list was announced everybody groaned when they saw us pitted against Man.Utd at Old Trafford on April Fools Day. And despite Paolo Wanchope giving us all a glimmer of hope with a 10th minute opener we ended up losing 7-1 - our heaviest defeat for many a year. Pity poor Craig Forrest who four years earlier had conceded 9 whilst playing there for former club Ipswich.</p> <p>Typical of our season we followed that disaster by winning three on the trot; against Newcastle (2-1), Derby (2-1) and Coventry (5-0). Almost as typical we lost to 'Boro at the Riverside again thanks to a goal from our arch nemesis, Brian Deane.</p> <p><strong>May - Foe Goes</strong></p> <p>The last three games of the 99/00 season saw us gain just one point. First a sickening 2-1 defeat at Arsenal; after we had led for so long and against one of the most biased performances you will ever see by a referee - thank you Mr.Durkin. A 1-0 defeat at Sunderland swiftly followed, which left the home game with Leeds.</p> <p>And what a disappointing way to end the season. 0-0 was enough to secure a 'Champions' League place for Leeds, whilst the Upton Park faithful were treated to the outgoing Marc-Vivien Foe receiving his marching orders for a well placed kick at a prone Leeds defender. We finished ninth - out third top ten finish in a row, but only a C- at best for Harry's men after we had seemed destined for European football again. One piece of good news - Freddy Kanoute signed a four-year contract.</p> <p><strong>June - Video Nasties</strong></p> <p>With no domestic football to look forward to until August heads turned to the Euro Championships. But whilst a nation was yet again experiencing the disappointment of another poor England show Rio and Frank were living it up in Ayia Napa turning heads of their own, and 'shocking' a nation with their antics according to the tabloids.</p> <p>The latest arrivals from our second academy at Highbury arrived in the shape of Nigel Winterburn and Davor Suker. Neither cost us a penny in transfers but at nearly \u00a350k a week in wages for the pair they didn't come cheap. </p> <p><strong>July - MD Talks</strong></p> <p>West Ham made their biggest signing of pre-season in July - Bobby Moore's collection of medals and other memorabilia came home for a little under \u00a32m.</p> <p>Hammers MD Paul Aldridge gave it up to complete an extensive Q&amp;A with KUMB (read it <a href=\"http://www.westhamunited-fc.com/Q&amp;A.shtml\">here</a>). The transfer rumour mill was in full flow - Rio Ferdinand was apparently about to sign for Leeds, and we were said to be hot on the trail of little known defender Hayden Foxe.</p> <p>The football started again with a 2-1 friendly defeat at Celtic. The South Coast tour began well with comprehensive wins at Bournemouth and Plymouth.</p> <p><strong>August - Goodbye Julian</strong></p> <p>Exeter and Swindon were duly disposed of in the latest legs of the pre-season programme, which continued later in the month with wins at Barnet and Rushden &amp; Diamonds. The transfer market went haywire before the season began - Paulo Wanchope went to Man.City, Gary Alexander to Swindon. Hayden Foxe arrived - and saw his permit application knocked back. Christian Basilla also arrived on a season long loan.</p> <p>Julian Dicks says goodbye to West Ham with an emotional farewell at Upton Park. The season started with a 4-2 defeat at Chelsea - which was swiftly followed by a 1-0 defeat at home to Leicester, and also saw the club up for misconduct under the new FA rules. The first point of the season came in a thrilling 2-2 draw with Man.Utd at Upton Park.</p> <p><strong>September - Goodbye to a legend</strong></p> <p>A 1-1 draw at Sunderland started the month off. That was swiftly followed by a 1-0 defeat at Spurs - a result which left the Hammers in the bottom three. The fuel crisis briefly threatened to disrupt the game with Liverpool which eventually finished 1-1 and left the Hammers bottom of the league still looking for a win.</p> <p>That duly arrived with the 1-0 win at Walsall in the Worthington Cup, thanks to a debut goal from late sub Jermain Defoe. The second leg finished 1-1 - and could have been much worse. The first league win came at Coventry - a 3-0 demolition which quelled the mounting calls for Redknapp's head. The month ended in disappointment with a 1-1 draw at home to Bradford thanks to a last minute Petrescu equaliser. Meanwhile, the reserves recorded their last win of 2000 at Notts.Forest. </p> <p>Paul Kitson went to Palace on a months loan, Gary Charles went to Birmingham and Marc Keller to Portsmouth for the same period. Kaba Diawara came in from PSG for the season. </p> <p>The month ended with the sad news of the death of Hammers legend John Dick (read our tribute <a href=\"http://www.westhamunited-fc.com/dick.shtml\">here</a>).</p> <p><strong>October - Light at the end of the tunnel? </strong></p> <p>The Hammers started life in October still bottom of the league - and were lucky to escape with a point at Ipswich. A footballing lesson duly followed from Arsenal before we finally climbed out of the bottom three with back to back wins against Newcastle (1-0) and Blackburn (2-0) in the Worthington Cup.</p> <p>Jon Vinton launched the 'Retire the 6' campaign which continues today. We talked to Daniel Sjolund (read it <a href=\"http://www.westhamunited-fc.co.uk/news1610001.shtml\">here</a>) and Paolo Di Canio (<a href=\"http://www.westhamunited-fc.co.uk/news2210002.shtml\">here</a>). KUMB launched on Teletext (Page 520).</p> <p><strong>November - Bye bye Rio</strong></p> <p>The fans were stunned by the news that the club had finally agreed to sell Rio Ferdinand to Leeds following months of speculation. The \u00a318m received for the Peckham born lad constituted a world record for a defender. Predictably the fans were up in arms until an impeccably-timed good run of form softened opinion somewhat.</p> <p>Our best month of the year (football wise) by far.

      "bodyText": "January 2000 - Villa Killer The new Millennium started off in pretty good fashion with two goals in the last five minutes at Newcastle to snatch a point. But that was as good as it got for a while, as the next two games saw us face Aston Villa twice - once in the Worthington Cup quarter-final replay (which we lost 3-1), and then in the league (Paolo Di Canio snatching a point with a late equaliser). Still, spirits were lifted with a comprehensive win at Leicester thanks to a brace from Paolo Wanchope - his first league goals since November. February - It's Frank v Paolo! There were only three games in February - which brought a total of sixteen goals. Unfortunately 10 of those were in our end! Gary Charles got his Hammers career off to a flyer with a last-gasp oggie at Southampton to gift Hoddle's disciples all three points. But the Hammers came back to win an extraordinary match at Upton Park against Bradford 5-4 - a game which saw Frank Lampard and Paolo Di Canio literally fighting over the ball for the right to take a penalty. Needless to say Di Canio won. The month ended with a 4-0 defeat at home to Everton - most notable for the worst goalkeeping debut ever witnessed at Upton Park, thanks to Sasa Ilic who had joined on loan from Charlton as injury cover. March - Goal of the Season With the Hammers Euro hopes faltering, the team put on a spirited burst during March which saw us gain 10 points from a possible 15. Consecutive wins against Watford and Southampton were followed by a disappointing defeat at doomed Sheffield Wednesday and a bore draw at home to Chelsea. March probably summed up the season - good in patches but too inconsistent to mount a serious challenge for a European spot. However, the month ended in spectacular fashion. Not the result - a fairly reasonable 2-1 win over Wimbledon - but Paolo Di Canio's stunning volley which rightly earned him the award for Goal of the Season. April - April Fools When the 99/00 fixture list was announced everybody groaned when they saw us pitted against Man.Utd at Old Trafford on April Fools Day. And despite Paolo Wanchope giving us all a glimmer of hope with a 10th minute opener we ended up losing 7-1 - our heaviest defeat for many a year. Pity poor Craig Forrest who four years earlier had conceded 9 whilst playing there for former club Ipswich. Typical of our season we followed that disaster by winning three on the trot; against Newcastle (2-1), Derby (2-1) and Coventry (5-0). Almost as typical we lost to 'Boro at the Riverside again thanks to a goal from our arch nemesis, Brian Deane. May - Foe Goes The last three games of the 99/00 season saw us gain just one point. First a sickening 2-1 defeat at Arsenal; after we had led for so long and against one of the most biased performances you will ever see by a referee - thank you Mr.Durkin. A 1-0 defeat at Sunderland swiftly followed, which left the home game with Leeds. And what a disappointing way to end the season. 0-0 was enough to secure a 'Champions' League place for Leeds, whilst the Upton Park faithful were treated to the outgoing Marc-Vivien Foe receiving his marching orders for a well placed kick at a prone Leeds defender. We finished ninth - out third top ten finish in a row, but only a C- at best for Harry's men after we had seemed destined for European football again. One piece of good news - Freddy Kanoute signed a four-year contract. June - Video Nasties With no domestic football to look forward to until August heads turned to the Euro Championships. But whilst a nation was yet again experiencing the disappointment of another poor England show Rio and Frank were living it up in Ayia Napa turning heads of their own, and 'shocking' a nation with their antics according to the tabloids. The latest arrivals from our second academy at Highbury arrived in the shape of Nigel Winterburn and Davor Suker. Neither cost us a penny in transfers but at nearly \u00a350k a week in wages for the pair they didn't come cheap. July - MD Talks West Ham made their biggest signing of pre-season in July - Bobby Moore's collection of medals and other memorabilia came home for a little under \u00a32m. Hammers MD Paul Aldridge gave it up to complete an extensive Q&amp;A with KUMB (read it here). The transfer rumour mill was in full flow - Rio Ferdinand was apparently about to sign for Leeds, and we were said to be hot on the trail of little known defender Hayden Foxe. The football started again with a 2-1 friendly defeat at Celtic. The South Coast tour began well with comprehensive wins at Bournemouth and Plymouth. August - Goodbye Julian Exeter and Swindon were duly disposed of in the latest legs of the pre-season programme, which continued later in the month with wins at Barnet and Rushden &amp; Diamonds. The transfer market went haywire before the season began - Paulo Wanchope went to Man.City, Gary Alexander to Swindon. Hayden Foxe arrived - and saw his permit application knocked back. Christian Basilla also arrived on a season long loan. Julian Dicks says goodbye to West Ham with an emotional farewell at Upton Park. The season started with a 4-2 defeat at Chelsea - which was swiftly followed by a 1-0 defeat at home to Leicester, and also saw the club up for misconduct under the new FA rules. The first point of the season came in a thrilling 2-2 draw with Man.Utd at Upton Park. September - Goodbye to a legend A 1-1 draw at Sunderland started the month off. That was swiftly followed by a 1-0 defeat at Spurs - a result which left the Hammers in the bottom three. The fuel crisis briefly threatened to disrupt the game with Liverpool which eventually finished 1-1 and left the Hammers bottom of the league still looking for a win. That duly arrived with the 1-0 win at Walsall in the Worthington Cup, thanks to a debut goal from late sub Jermain Defoe. The second leg finished 1-1 - and could have been much worse. The first league win came at Coventry - a 3-0 demolition which quelled the mounting calls for Redknapp's head. The month ended in disappointment with a 1-1 draw at home to Bradford thanks to a last minute Petrescu equaliser. Meanwhile, the reserves recorded their last win of 2000 at Notts.Forest. Paul Kitson went to Palace on a months loan, Gary Charles went to Birmingham and Marc Keller to Portsmouth for the same period. Kaba Diawara came in from PSG for the season. The month ended with the sad news of the death of Hammers legend John Dick (read our tribute here). October - Light at the end of the tunnel? The Hammers started life in October still bottom of the league - and were lucky to escape with a point at Ipswich. A footballing lesson duly followed from Arsenal before we finally climbed out of the bottom three with back to back wins against Newcastle (1-0) and Blackburn (2-0) in the Worthington Cup. Jon Vinton launched the 'Retire the 6' campaign which continues today. We talked to Daniel Sjolund (read it here) and Paolo Di Canio (here). KUMB launched on Teletext (Page 520). November - Bye bye Rio The fans were stunned by the news that the club had finally agreed to sell Rio Ferdinand to Leeds following months of speculation. The \u00a318m received for the Peckham born lad constituted a world record for a defender. Predictably the fans were up in arms until an impeccably-timed good run of form softened opinion somewhat. Our best month of the year (football wise) by far. Ten points from four league games including stunning wins at Southampton and Leeds - traditionally bogey grounds for us. Man.City were taught a footballing lesson in a four goal second half blitz at Upton Park. The form was only marred by a dreadful 0-0 draw at Derby. In typical West Ham fashion we followed up the impressive league form with defeat at home to first division Sheffield Wednesday in the Worthington Cup. KUMB talked to Tony Cottee (read that here) and Frank Lampard joined us for an excellent Q&amp;A (read here). We won an award for best Hammers site on the web. Which was nice. Transfer-wise Rigobert Song came in from Liverpool, and Daniel Sjolund went the other way in a \u00a31m deal. December - Hell freezes over ... The Hammers stretched their unbeaten run in the league to nine games with a win over Middlesbrough and draws against Villa and Everton, before Leicester ended the run with a 2-1 defeat at Filbert Street. Christmas was a day late at Upton Park as Charlton were thrashed 5-0 on Boxing Day; the Hammers biggest win for 8 months. Just as last year had ended in farce with the Manny Omoyinmi scandal so this year saw the last league game of the year cancelled just two hours from kick-off after the club had made Titanic-like boasts about it's \u00a31m undersoil heating system - which duly packed up at the first sign of ice. Hannu Tihinen joined the club on a three month loan deal. Titi Camara became the second Liverpool player to join inside a month as he signs for \u00a31.5m. Harry Redknapp's audacious \u00a310m bid for Inter's Robbie Keane fails. Paolo Di Canio wins plaudits worldwide for his amazing act of sportsmanship in the game against Everton. Harry Redknapp doesn't know whether to laugh or cry. The first KUMB Christmas jolly took place at the Hamilton Hall - hopefully you'll all be back next year!

How well travelled the list shows him: proof of diligence on critics' juries the world over. Refreshing, too: how assiduously he prefers the secondary work to the certified masterpiece, thus giving us all more oxygen to argue with. </p> <p>My own quibbles: surely Kubrick's Dr Strangelove, Antonioni's L'Avventura and Huston's The Dead (over Paths of Glory, The Passenger and Fat City). Weak on the comic - if Will Hay, why not George Formby? - and unexpectedly strong on the erotic: glad that Capra's Bitter Tea of General Yen, a tauntingly pre-Morality Code cockteaser, has beaten out It's a Wonderful Life. I hope some day, on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, I am asked who directed Pakeezah. Now I know. </p> <p> <strong> Nick Fisher, the Sun</strong> </p> <p> This is a buff's list, not a punter's list. Where's Erin Brockovich and Men In Black? Where's American Beauty or American Pie or American Movie, come to that? Long films with dense subtitles are not my cup of rosie. I think Derek and me would be hard pushed to ever pick a Saturday night out at the flicks together. Does he even eat popcorn?</p> <p>I think I read down to Kes before I even recognised any of these names as movies. Kinda smells of pretension to me. But hey, without buffs there would be no poncey foreign film festivals. And we know how important they are. Not. Kes, Apocalypse Now, Raging Bull and Night At The Opera ... yep, I go along with all of these as firm candidates for any Top 100. But, as for the other 96 titles, you're on your own Del. </p> <p> <strong> Jean Roy - L'Humanit\u00e9 (France)</strong> </p> <p> As any \"favourite\" list, as opposed to \"best\", Derek's one is very revealing. It proves his extensive knowledge of world cinema, whatever the country or the period, his preference for style over stars, and for films which deserve to be reminded over crowd-pleasers (no Gone With The Wind). </p> <p>It also shows his resistance to cliches (Strike, and not Potemkin, Touch of Evil and not Citizen Kane, Young Mr Lincoln and not Stagecoach, Beyond a Reasonable Doubt and not M, Boudu and not Rules of the Game), and his openness to everything from Fantasia to Behind the Green Door. He is a brave man. </p> <p> <strong> Geoff Andrew - Time Out</strong> </p> <p> A solid, admirably open-minded selection, albeit mostly somewhat classical. Putting aside personal taste (I detest Brief Encounter), I was surprised by the inclusion of the Reeves, Morrissey, Mitchell Brothers(!) and Blank films, and by the kitschiest Disney. Most glaring omissions: no Davies, Demy, Dovzhenko, Kiarostami, Leone, Malick, Yang - and no Lumi\u00e8res or M\u00e9li\u00e8s. </p> <p> <strong> Nick James - Sight and Sound</strong> </p> <p> Personal canons are always the best, and Malcolm's astute choice of one film per great auteur is rich with surprise and understanding of the quality of world cinema, but I regret the generational bias which excludes any current auteur or film made since 1985. </p> <p> <strong> Peter Keough - The Phoenix (USA)</strong> </p> <p> You've got to admire a 100 best movie list that omits Citizen Kane but includes Behind the Green Door. Derek Malcolm's favourites include many of the obvious auteurs, but not the obvious films - Ford's Young Mr. Lincoln rather than The Searchers, Renoir's Boudu Saved from Drowning rather than Rules of the Game, Capra's Bitter Tea of General Yen rather than anything else (but why Coppola's bloated Apocalypse Now, rather than The Conversation?) </p> <p>Also, a plus is the emphasis on non-Hollywood movies and developing countries (though where is Abbas Kiarostami?). In short, I disagree with about half, which is what a list like this should accomplish - provoke discussion and challenge preconceptions. </p> <p> <strong> Klause Eder - German critic</strong> </p> <p> I tried desperately to find favourite films which Derek might have missed. No chance: they're all in. I'm time and again surprised at the variety and openness of his film taste - avoiding the common-sense film history and engaging himself for outsiders as well as \"exotic\" directors, in particular from Asian cinematographers. See his favourites, and you know how exciting cinema can be. </p> <p> <strong> David Thomson - Independent on Sunday</strong> </p> <p> Glaring errors? Films that don't deserve to be there? What is the point of inventing such silly games and then reporting them to some Supreme Court? DM has every right to play top l00 films if it amuses you, but why should anyone else be dragged in, and why should a mere list be given such Schindlerian gravity? </p> <p> <strong> Philip French - The Observer</strong> </p> <p>Critics put their reputations on the line every week judging the new films, and every December, by picking the year's 10 best. To publish a book on the \"100 best films of the century\" is really putting your head on the block, even if that \"best\" is qualified as \"personal\". Derek Malcolm's choice strikes me as sound and stimulating, a mixture of the conservative and the adventurous. The usual suspects are there, but often represented by unexpected films (eg a Touch of Evil instead of Citizen Kane, The Bitter Tea of General Yen rather than Mr Deeds Goes to Town), and all the movies are of value. </p> <p>Personally, I regret the absence of Sirk, Boetticher, Donen, Vertov, Tourneur, Whale, Kazan, Boorman, Malle and Roeg, but recognise that Malcolm is making a statement by omitting Spielberg. There are no Australian directors represented, and no SF flicks. All lists reveal something about the compiler, and there's a lot of sex and socialism here.</p>",

Derek Malcolm's favourites include many of the obvious auteurs, but not the obvious films - Ford's Young Mr. Lincoln rather than The Searchers, Renoir's Boudu Saved from Drowning rather than Rules of the Game, Capra's Bitter Tea of General Yen rather than anything else (but why Coppola's bloated Apocalypse Now, rather than The Conversation?) Also, a plus is the emphasis on non-Hollywood movies and developing countries (though where is Abbas Kiarostami?). In short, I disagree with about half, which is what a list like this should accomplish - provoke discussion and challenge preconceptions. Klause Eder - German critic I tried desperately to find favourite films which Derek might have missed. No chance: they're all in. I'm time and again surprised at the variety and openness of his film taste - avoiding the common-sense film history and engaging himself for outsiders as well as \"exotic\" directors, in particular from Asian cinematographers. See his favourites, and you know how exciting cinema can be. David Thomson - Independent on Sunday Glaring errors? Films that don't deserve to be there? What is the point of inventing such silly games and then reporting them to some Supreme Court? DM has every right to play top l00 films if it amuses you, but why should anyone else be dragged in, and why should a mere list be given such Schindlerian gravity? Philip French - The Observer Critics put their reputations on the line every week judging the new films, and every December, by picking the year's 10 best. To publish a book on the \"100 best films of the century\" is really putting your head on the block, even if that \"best\" is qualified as \"personal\". Derek Malcolm's choice strikes me as sound and stimulating, a mixture of the conservative and the adventurous. The usual suspects are there, but often represented by unexpected films (eg a Touch of Evil instead of Citizen Kane, The Bitter Tea of General Yen rather than Mr Deeds Goes to Town), and all the movies are of value. Personally, I regret the absence of Sirk, Boetticher, Donen, Vertov, Tourneur, Whale, Kazan, Boorman, Malle and Roeg, but recognise that Malcolm is making a statement by omitting Spielberg. There are no Australian directors represented, and no SF flicks. All lists reveal something about the compiler, and there's a lot of sex and socialism here.",

Reports from Zimbabwe - including a source within the Zimbabwean government - say he died in a plane on route to receive medical treatment. The British and Belgian foreign ministries believe Kabila is dead. What is certain is that Kabila has not appeared in public since the shooting, but neither has his body been produced. His son, army leader Joseph Kabila, has been appointed interim leader by his father's officials. <p><b>Who wants Laurent Kabila dead?</b><br>Kabila has not been short of enemies during his nearly four years in power. The Democratic Republic of Congo has been embroiled in a bloody civil war for two and a half years and any of the competing factions could have been behind his death. Millions have died in the war; in June last year the International Rescue Committee, a US-based humanitarian organisation, estimated that 2,600 people were dying every day.</p> <p><b>Who would take over the country if Kabila is dead?</b><br>The attack on Kabila seems to have been an assassination attempt rather than part of a coup, so his government is still in charge. But Congo has never recovered from the vacuum of power left when the country's long-term dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko, fled the country in 1997. The intimate involvement of numerous and competing foreign interests makes the Congo difficult to govern effectively, and Kabila has no obvious successor. Much of the country's infrastructure has been destroyed in the civil war, particularly in the eastern part of the country nearest Rwanda and Uganda.</p> <p><b>Who are the main players in the civil war? </b><br>There are two main factions in the war, neither of which have popular support among the people of the Congo. The first are the anti-Kabila rebels backed by the governments and armies of Uganda and Rwanda. They are opposed by pro-Kabila troops backed by Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola. There are also numerous internal rebel armies, mostly backed by foreign powers.</p> <p><b>What is the war about? </b><br>The Democratic Republic of the Congo - known as Zaire before Kabila changed the name in 1997 - was ruled for over 30 years by Mobutu, a brutal dictator. Mobutu's grip on power was slipping seven years ago when a civil war in neighbouring Rwanda broke out. The Hutu, who make up the majority of the Rwandan population, began slaughtering the minority Tutsi. The genocidal murder of 800,000 Tutsis came to an end when Tutsi forces gained control of the country. The now outlawed Hutus fled to Zaire where they were sheltered by Mobutu.</p> <p><b>How did the Rwandan war spill over into Zaire? </b><br>Rwanda - along with another neighbouring country, Uganda - wanted to round up the Hutu rebels and bring them back, but the government felt it could not simply invade Zaire without a better excuse. To cover up its actions, Rwanda and Uganda recruited Kabila to lead an indigenous revolt within Zaire to bring down Mobutu. The Rwandans and Ugandans felt that if Kabila won power, he would protect their countries by stamping out the Hutu rebels. </p> <p><b>So is Kabila popular within the Congo?</b><br>Kabila was hailed as a conquering hero when he marched into Congo's capital, Kinshasa, in May 1997 to oust Mobutu. The people of Congo needed a change of leadership and hoped he would turn around the legacy of terror and corruption left behind by Mobutu. And Kabila's backers in Rwanda and Uganda felt they could now wage war on the Hutu rebels with his blessing.</p> <p><b>What went wrong? </b><br>One year later, Kabila changed his mind about the Hutus and refused to force them back into Rwanda. The Rwandans and Ugandans abruptly switched sides and began to support rebels seeking to overthrow Kabila. For his part, Kabila courted support from Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe, all of which had interests in using the vast nation of Congo for its own purposes. Angola wanted to fight the rebels from its own civil war who sheltered in Congo, and Zimbabwe was hoping to get rich off the mineral rights Kabila signed over. </p> <p><b>What is the future for Congo if Kabila is dead?</b><br>Congo sits at the centre of Africa and is the third largest nation on the continent. It has a vast wealth of minerals and plenty of land which can be used either for lucrative agriculture, mineral exploitation, or as has happened more recently, to shelter the rebels from other nations' wars. So many powerbrokers in the region want a hand in controlling Congo. Kabila's death would probably not end the civil war. The United Nations has long toyed with the idea of a peacekeeping mission there, but so far nothing has materialised. </p> <p><b>Audio report</b><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0117mcgreal.ra\">17.01.2001: Chris McGreal asks who is running the Congo</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,423426,00.html\">17.01.2001: Congo leader Kabila 'killed' by bodyguard in palace shooting</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4027821,00.html\">10.06.2000: 2,600 a day dying in Congolese war</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4009203,00.html\">18.04.2000: Congo airport death toll climbs to 109</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,3968090,00.html\">27.02.2000: Ethnic war deepens in Congo</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,3830886,00.html\">Central African timeline</a><br></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.facts.com/wnd/kabila.htm\" target=\"_new\">Biography of Laurent Kabila</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.newafrica.com/maps/drcongo.asp\" target=\"_new\">Map of DR Congo</a><br></p>",

      "body": "<p>Auberon Waugh is a difficult person to defend against the people who loathed him, or, more accurately, the people who had made up their minds about him many years ago and refused to read him. To them, he was the \"racist, sexist snob\" evoked by the BBC reporter Nick Higham in yesterday's instant radio obituary. More particularly, they saw him as a reduced version of Evelyn Waugh's renowned spite and conservatism; yet without the talent. </p> <p>The truth is that Bron didn't much care what people thought of him and in fact he used this as one of the longest-running jokes of his career, conjuring up in his numerous columns a blimpish figure who was all the things that Higham so automatically trotted out. It was a tease which worked from early in his career at the Daily Mirror through his work for the Spectator, Private Eye and the Telegraph. But, as with his father, it was often a problem to see where the tease ended and the real Waugh began. </p> <p>I first met Bron at a Private Eye lunch in the late 70s when he was doing his best to annoy everyone with an extravagantly funny and offensive diary that ran every fortnight in the Eye. Also at the lunch were Peter McKay, Richard Ingrams, Peter Cook, Willie Rushton and John Wells, the last three of whom are all sadly dead. It was an unforgettable day for a young journalist - a lot of laughter and very good jokes. </p> <p>Bron seemed to me to be a rather frightening figure, party because he said exactly what came to his mind but also because he was very shrewd and funny. Later, when I got to know him slightly better, he came round for supper and I made the mistake of asking him what he thought of a book I had just written about the failings of Fleet Street. \"I didn't like it much,\" he said. There was a pause while he searched for the word he wanted. \"Rather priggish, I thought.\" </p> <p>He was utterly fearless and possessed one of the most independent minds of his generation of journalists. He would not tolerate cant from either side of the political divide. Just as the Conservative press had decided that Princess Diana was thoroughly mad and bad, Bron became her champion, claiming that she had been ill-treated by the royal family. And of course he was absolutely right. </p> <p>Just as his colleagues, such as Christopher Booker, became convinced of the unwavering evil represented by the institutions of the European Union, Bron decided that our only hope was to become ever more integrated. He liked Europe and believed in its superior civilisation, whereas he nurtured a lifelong mistrust of American culture. </p> <p>He took such causes rather seriously - he could not have been so devastatingly funny if he hadn't been essentially earnest about them. But the one thing he never took seriously was himself. He could be teased and, while the most vicious attack would certainly provoke reprisal, he never once appeared to take it to heart. It was all part of the game. </p> <p>I once played a disastrous joke on him that ended in a long-running legal dispute between the then literary editor of the Sunday Times, Claire Tomalin, and Private Eye. The hoax involved a little volume called Recent Gay and Lesbian Fiction that I sent to Bron with a note purporting to come from Tomalin that asked him to review the book favourably. I seem to remember the phrase \"knowing your sympathy for the gay movement\" appeared fairly high up in the letter. I also advised him to make a phone call to the literary department of the Sunday Times before setting off on his review. </p> <p>This, unfortunately, he failed to do. If he had called Tomalin he would have discovered the hoax. Instead he rushed into print with a vituperative item in his diary that, needless to say, resulted in a writ from the Sunday Times. The point was that Bron didn't object to gays or gay fiction; he simply hated being told what to think and write. The letter seemed to confirm his suspicions about the then liberal Sunday Times. </p> <p>The case dragged on and became more and more bitter. Meanwhile nobody at Private Eye or the Sunday Times had the slightest idea who had written the letter. I kept my head down for two years while Bron fought it out with the paper's lawyers. Huge bundles of letters accumulated as he argued that he had not accused Tomalin of being a left winger or a lesbian, but that even if he had, it would have been insulting rather than damaging. </p> <p>At length Bron guessed I was the author and confronted me in the mildest possible terms at another Private Eye lunch. When I confessed he just laughed, a reaction that contrasted to the eruption that took place at the Sunday Times, where I was required to make a shaming public apology to Tomalin, the other victim of my idiotic hoax. </p> <p>When the case was over and the settlement agreed upon, I took Bron out to lunch by way of an apology. The whole affair had left him rather weary and cross about the libel laws, but he didn't take it out on me. Instead, he gave me a long lecture about effective lying. \"The thing is,\" he said, \"you should tell the truth as often as you can, but in such a way as people don't believe you or think that you're being funny.\" </p> <p>I learned quite a lot about him at that lunch. He appeared much more the melancholic than I would have ever guessed and was evidently prone to romantic yearnings. Except for male friends of long standing such as Richard Ingrams and the Guardian columnist Alexander Chancellor, he seemed to prefer women's company. And they liked him for his beady cleverness and the quality that many people will never credit - his sympathetic ear. In person he was also astoundingly polite. </p> <p>These traits never came over on TV and it was quite hard to spot the mildness and tolerance of his nature in his writing. But it was there and the irony is that he was more liberal in his attitudes than many self-proclaimed liberals. He simply couldn't stand the bossiness of modern society - one group of self- appointed nannies deciding what the rest of us can and can't do. Hence his long campaign against the MPs who voted against fox hunting. </p> <p>The other regular target of his astonishingly versatile pen (he wrote four very good novels) was the thuggery of the popular press and its degrading influence on national life. He hated the jeering of the tabloids and the way they descend on celebrities who fall from grace. Perhaps we have come to accept this as part of the British character, a congenial indulgence of the mob, but latterly it seemed he could never take much satisfaction from the downfall of people such as Jonathan Aitken, even though Aitken had resorted to the hated libel laws and very nearly won his case against the Guardian. </p> <p>But let me not get too carried away. Bron was exceptionally tough on his enemies. When he suspected that the leftwing columnist and campaigner John Pilger had been misled when he was exposing the exploitation of child labour in Cambodia, he never let go. Pilger had arranged to buy a young girl called Sunee in Bangkok as proof of his allegations. He movingly wrote an account of returning the child to her parents, only to discover that she had been legitimately studying in Bangkok. He could be forgiven for being hoaxed, but Bron never did and pursued him remorselessly in the Spectator, even coining the verb \"to pilger\". </p> <p> Bron wrote quickly and wittily, which enabled him to appear in a lot of publications over the course of a week. The tone of these articles varied enormously. In one publication you might find a cruel dismissal of some benighted minister's efforts; then in another an endearing account of how he had been looked after in one of his numerous stays in hospital. If he had formed one of his curious obsessions about you, you certainly felt it, as Jeremy Thorpe, the disgraced Liberal leader, will testify. On other occasions his campaigns, for instance against Harry Evans and Lord Gowrie, seemed frankly mystifying, and that was because there were private scores being settled, chiefly over women, one gathers. </p> <p>I often wondered about this part of Bron's character. It seemed so odd that a man who hated bullies and vindictiveness was capable of being both. Perhaps it was because he had so little self-pity and assumed that people were as robust as he was. It's difficult to know, but he was certainly aware that he had caused a great deal of offence over the years. \"Looking back over my career to date,\" he said in his 1991 autobiography Will This Do?, \"and at all the people I have insulted, I am mildly surprised that I am still allowed to exist.\" </p> <p>Now he no longer does, I shall miss reading him. He really was a cut above the rest, despite - and perhaps because of - his obvious failings. But surprisingly these did not actually include snobbery, racism and sexism.</p>",

Also at the lunch were Peter McKay, Richard Ingrams, Peter Cook, Willie Rushton and John Wells, the last three of whom are all sadly dead. It was an unforgettable day for a young journalist - a lot of laughter and very good jokes. Bron seemed to me to be a rather frightening figure, party because he said exactly what came to his mind but also because he was very shrewd and funny. Later, when I got to know him slightly better, he came round for supper and I made the mistake of asking him what he thought of a book I had just written about the failings of Fleet Street. \"I didn't like it much,\" he said. There was a pause while he searched for the word he wanted. \"Rather priggish, I thought.\" He was utterly fearless and possessed one of the most independent minds of his generation of journalists. He would not tolerate cant from either side of the political divide. Just as the Conservative press had decided that Princess Diana was thoroughly mad and bad, Bron became her champion, claiming that she had been ill-treated by the royal family. And of course he was absolutely right. Just as his colleagues, such as Christopher Booker, became convinced of the unwavering evil represented by the institutions of the European Union, Bron decided that our only hope was to become ever more integrated. He liked Europe and believed in its superior civilisation, whereas he nurtured a lifelong mistrust of American culture. He took such causes rather seriously - he could not have been so devastatingly funny if he hadn't been essentially earnest about them. But the one thing he never took seriously was himself. He could be teased and, while the most vicious attack would certainly provoke reprisal, he never once appeared to take it to heart. It was all part of the game. I once played a disastrous joke on him that ended in a long-running legal dispute between the then literary editor of the Sunday Times, Claire Tomalin, and Private Eye. The hoax involved a little volume called Recent Gay and Lesbian Fiction that I sent to Bron with a note purporting to come from Tomalin that asked him to review the book favourably. I seem to remember the phrase \"knowing your sympathy for the gay movement\" appeared fairly high up in the letter. I also advised him to make a phone call to the literary department of the Sunday Times before setting off on his review. This, unfortunately, he failed to do. If he had called Tomalin he would have discovered the hoax. Instead he rushed into print with a vituperative item in his diary that, needless to say, resulted in a writ from the Sunday Times. The point was that Bron didn't object to gays or gay fiction; he simply hated being told what to think and write. The letter seemed to confirm his suspicions about the then liberal Sunday Times. The case dragged on and became more and more bitter. Meanwhile nobody at Private Eye or the Sunday Times had the slightest idea who had written the letter. I kept my head down for two years while Bron fought it out with the paper's lawyers. Huge bundles of letters accumulated as he argued that he had not accused Tomalin of being a left winger or a lesbian, but that even if he had, it would have been insulting rather than damaging. At length Bron guessed I was the author and confronted me in the mildest possible terms at another Private Eye lunch. When I confessed he just laughed, a reaction that contrasted to the eruption that took place at the Sunday Times, where I was required to make a shaming public apology to Tomalin, the other victim of my idiotic hoax. When the case was over and the settlement agreed upon, I took Bron out to lunch by way of an apology. The whole affair had left him rather weary and cross about the libel laws, but he didn't take it out on me. Instead, he gave me a long lecture about effective lying. \"The thing is,\" he said, \"you should tell the truth as often as you can, but in such a way as people don't believe you or think that you're being funny.\" I learned quite a lot about him at that lunch. He appeared much more the melancholic than I would have ever guessed and was evidently prone to romantic yearnings. Except for male friends of long standing such as Richard Ingrams and the Guardian columnist Alexander Chancellor, he seemed to prefer women's company. And they liked him for his beady cleverness and the quality that many people will never credit - his sympathetic ear. In person he was also astoundingly polite. These traits never came over on TV and it was quite hard to spot the mildness and tolerance of his nature in his writing. But it was there and the irony is that he was more liberal in his attitudes than many self-proclaimed liberals. He simply couldn't stand the bossiness of modern society - one group of self- appointed nannies deciding what the rest of us can and can't do. Hence his long campaign against the MPs who voted against fox hunting. The other regular target of his astonishingly versatile pen (he wrote four very good novels) was the thuggery of the popular press and its degrading influence on national life. He hated the jeering of the tabloids and the way they descend on celebrities who fall from grace. Perhaps we have come to accept this as part of the British character, a congenial indulgence of the mob, but latterly it seemed he could never take much satisfaction from the downfall of people such as Jonathan Aitken, even though Aitken had resorted to the hated libel laws and very nearly won his case against the Guardian. But let me not get too carried away. Bron was exceptionally tough on his enemies. When he suspected that the leftwing columnist and campaigner John Pilger had been misled when he was exposing the exploitation of child labour in Cambodia, he never let go. Pilger had arranged to buy a young girl called Sunee in Bangkok as proof of his allegations. He movingly wrote an account of returning the child to her parents, only to discover that she had been legitimately studying in Bangkok. He could be forgiven for being hoaxed, but Bron never did and pursued him remorselessly in the Spectator, even coining the verb \"to pilger\". Bron wrote quickly and wittily, which enabled him to appear in a lot of publications over the course of a week. The tone of these articles varied enormously. In one publication you might find a cruel dismissal of some benighted minister's efforts; then in another an endearing account of how he had been looked after in one of his numerous stays in hospital. If he had formed one of his curious obsessions about you, you certainly felt it, as Jeremy Thorpe, the disgraced Liberal leader, will testify. On other occasions his campaigns, for instance against Harry Evans and Lord Gowrie, seemed frankly mystifying, and that was because there were private scores being settled, chiefly over women, one gathers. I often wondered about this part of Bron's character. It seemed so odd that a man who hated bullies and vindictiveness was capable of being both. Perhaps it was because he had so little self-pity and assumed that people were as robust as he was. It's difficult to know, but he was certainly aware that he had caused a great deal of offence over the years. \"Looking back over my career to date,\" he said in his 1991 autobiography Will This Do?, \"and at all the people I have insulted, I am mildly surprised that I am still allowed to exist.\" Now he no longer does, I shall miss reading him. He really was a cut above the rest, despite - and perhaps because of - his obvious failings. But surprisingly these did not actually include snobbery, racism and sexism.",

      "body": "<p>Auberon Waugh's death at the age of 61 is more sad than surprising. His immediate heredity wasn't promising - his father died at 62, his mother at 57 - and he suffered from ill-health all his life, partly resulting from severe wounds sustained during National Service at the age of 18.</p> <p>That may, in part, have accounted for the acidic personality which made him the most verbally brutal journalist of his age. Everyone who met him remarked on the contrast between his ferocity in print and his personal geniality, but this was hard to explain to those who didn't know him, especially if they had been on the rough end of his pen.</p> <p>Apart from health, his background shaped his career in one other respect. He spent much of his life trying to escape from the shadow of his father, the greatest English novelist of his age. This provided an obvious weapon for Auberon's enemies. Philip Larkin joked about \"my projected series, Talentless Sons of Famous Fathers - Waugh, Amis, Fuller...\", and for Polly Toynbee, \"Poor Bron is but a Randolph to a Winston.\" In fact, Auberon Waugh could be called many things, but not talentless, as he showed once he shook off that shadow.</p> <p>He was the second child and first son of Evelyn and Laura Waugh. Auberon Alexander - always Bron to those who knew him and to many who didn't - was born just as the war broke out, and just as his father was setting off on his quixotic and in the end bitterly thwarted search for military redemption. Bron barely saw his father until he was five, and even thereafter Evelyn boasted with chilling jocosity that he saw his children \"once a day for 10, I hope awe-inspiring, minutes\".</p> <p>After his father's death in 1966, Bron became his champion and continued many of his feuds. But his distinctly bleak autobiography Will This Do? (1991) casts a cold light on those early years, epitomised by the moment when father removed son's banana - a rare delicacy at the end of the war - from his plate and ate it. Coming clean, Bron would now admit that he had barely begun to like his father by the time of his death.</p> <p>For his part, Evelyn never concealed the boredom and vexation Bron caused him. Father wrote to 16-year-old son with considerable insight, \"You have a sense of humour and a gift of self- expression. On the other hand you are singularly imprudent and you have a defective sense of honour. These bad qualities can lead to disaster.\"</p> <p>Although Bron Waugh was often described as reactionary or rightwing, this missed the point about him personally as well as ideologically. If he was a Tory, he was a Tory anarchist, whose upbringing was a series of rebellions. He detested Downside, the Benedictine public school, quaintly claiming that the headmaster had \"set himself up in opposition to me\".</p> <p>He then loathed his National Service training, and never ceased to rail at the stupidity and brutality he had encountered at the Guards depot at Pirbright. Waugh was nevertheless commissioned into the Royal Horse Guards (The Blues), and sent to Cyprus. There one day he became annoyed by a fault in the Browning machine-gun of his armoured car, seized it by the muzzle and shook it, until it had fired several rounds through his chest at pointblank range. He was very lucky to survive.</p> <p>This later inspired one of his best columns, in the New Statesman. He had heard it said, Waugh wrote, that he had been shot by his own men, or that he had lost a testicle. In reality, the injury had been self-inflicted, and he had lost a lung, his spleen, several ribs, and a finger, \"but nothing else (my italics)\".</p> <p>While recuperating in Italy, he began his first novel. The Foxglove Saga (1960) was undoubtedly promising, and was undoubtedly helped by the name Waugh. It sold 14,000 in hardback, setting a mark for later disappointment. Waugh then went up briefly to Christ Church, Oxford, to which he had won an exhibition in English, to read PPE, but left after a year having failed to pass an exam, and taken a dislike to the academic authorities. After an unsuccessful attempt to join the Foreign Office - yet another part of the establishment which earned his undying enmity - he turned the obvious way.</p> <p>His early career in Fleet Street was chequered, working briefly for the Peterborough column on the Daily Telegraph, then joining the Daily Mirror. The highlight of his career as a Mirrorman was in 1967. During the Six Day war he flew to Israel, where Mandy Rice-Davies was said to have gone to the front as a nurse. In fact, she was pursuing her usual honest trade as a Tel Aviv night-club hostess but, in the best Scoop tradition, Waugh had her don a nurse's uniform for a photograph. He saw this as one of his proudest journalistic achievements, along with another some years later when a column of his in the Times, which included a flippant joke about the prophet Mohammed, led an enraged mob to burn down the British Council building in Rawalpindi.</p> <p>In 1967, he was made political columnist of the Spectator, an enterprising choice on the part of the then editor, Nigel Lawson. Waugh took his duties seriously enough, though attendance at Westminster only increased his aversion to politics and politicians. His time at the Spectator coincided with the Biafra war, when the Ibo-speaking, and largely Catholic, province seceded from Nigeria. This was the first serious cause to engage Waugh, who poured savage indignation on the Wilson government and Michael Stewart, the foreign secretary, for colluding at the conduct of the war, in which millions of Africans were starved into submission.</p> <p>In 1970, Waugh abruptly left the Spectator. He had been seeing the week's issue through the press, and on a whim changed George Gale's name to \"Lunchtime O'Gale\" in the contributors' list. When Lawson sacked him, Waugh sued for wrongful dismissal. After a court case worthy of Beachcomber, when Bernard Levin and Alan Watkins testified on his behalf, he surprisingly won damages of \u00a3600.</p> <p>Despite this, Lawson magnanimously re-employed Waugh as a novel reviewer, where he honed his talent for vituperation, which he later and even more brilliantly practised in the obscure magazine Books &amp; Bookmen. Like other \"slashing\" reviewers, he would point out that he often lavished praise on the writers he liked. These were far from predictable. One favourite was the Californian hippy novelist Richard Brautigan, another Angela Carter. And Martin Amis never forgot how \"very generous\" Waugh had been.</p> <p>In 1970 he found a natural billet at Private Eye. The \"Diary\" he wrote for the Eye over the next 16 years was unique, a combination of polemic, causerie, parody and fantasy. Those who liked it thought it very funny indeed, though its technique was partly pure abuse.</p> <p>Harold Wilson was an \"old crook\" (and a Soviet agent, Waugh sometimes suggested), with his \"revoltingly ugly\" colleague Barbara Castle. Not that Waugh was politically partisan. Heath was a buffoonish ninny, and Churchill a \"war criminal, mass murderer and persecutor of PG Wodehouse\".</p> <p>This taste for the calculatedly distasteful even extended to his wine columns: he compared one wine to \"a bunch of dead chrysanthemums on the grave of a still-born West Indian baby\". He ruthlessly used these columns, and the Spectator Wine Club, to stock his own cellar. Waugh was never squeamish about journalistic ethics. Once he discovered the delights of the \"freebie\", he gave breathless accounts of his trips to the Orient, and the wonderful \"Thai two-girl massage\".</p> <p>Sometimes his abuse was random. Watching television of an evening, Waugh caught the Tchaikovsky bio-pic, The Music Lovers. \"Hideous woman, dreadful film. One can't really blame Tchaikovsky for preferring boys. Anyone might become a homosexual who had once seen Glenda Jackson naked.\"</p> <p>But other diatribes were deliberate. Waugh had a truly Sicilian taste for vendetta, pursuing Lord Gowrie for decades because they had once competed, Gowrie successfully, for the same girl at Oxford. His tendresse for Tina Brown helped explain another long feud, with Harold Evans. His diatribes against Jimmy Goldsmith (on the possible size of whose \"organ\" he once dilated in print), or Shirley Williams, at any rate had no personal basis.</p> <p>If that sounded childish, Waugh's writing was valued by good judges. Anthony Howard took on Waugh for the New Statesman, where he wrote some of his best columns for what he imagined was his typical reader, a bad-tempered leftwing woman teacher in the Midlands.</p> <p>By now Waugh had finally given up fiction, after publishing five novels in all. He said that his novels were not selling any more and were not getting any better, though at least one, Consider the Lilies (1968) is still very funny and readable (the others are Path of Dalliance, 1963, Who Are the Violets Now, 1966, and A Bed of Flowers, 1971). Maybe the truth was that abandoning fiction was another way of escaping his father's shadow.</p> <p>Another was his increasingly detached attitude to Catholicism. Gradually he stopped going to church, later ceasing to be a practising or even believing Catholic.</p> <p>In 1976, the new editor of the Spectator, Alexander Chancellor, hired Waugh to write a weekly column. This decade, his own thirties, was perhaps the best of Waugh's writing life. His political as well as literary opinions were unpredictable. If he went on repetitiously about the \"foul-mouthed, dirty and drunk\" working classes, he disliked them not least because of their taste for punishment, especially capital punishment, which he abhorred. He also loathed war, and later opposed the Falklands, Gulf and Kosovo campaigns. In his idiosyncratic way, he was part of an authentic mood of revulsion against the bossy authoritarianism of left and right.</p> <p>Then he found another obsession. Jeremy Thorpe, the Liberal leader, had been caught up in a seamy scandal concerning a youth called Norman Scott, which led finally to Thorpe's departure as party leader and then his prosecution and acquittal. At the 1979 general election, Waugh stood against Thorpe in his North Devon constituency on behalf of the Dog Lovers' Party, an allusion to the strange episode when a hitman trying to frighten Scott, or worse, shot his pet dog. Waugh lost his deposit, but had the gratification of hearing Lord Denning say that his election address, which Thorpe had tried to suppress, could be published, and of seeing Thorpe lose his seat.</p> <p>Then Waugh published a book about the case, The Last Word. It showed his inability (shared by all the Eye gang) to understand the basic principles of justice, but it also supplied an appropriate note of black farce: as the journalist David Leigh said, Waugh gave a version of the affair in the style of Joe Orton.</p> <p>That North Devon constituency was near home for Waugh. He had married very young, in 1961, Lady Teresa Onslow, daughter of the Earl of Onslow, and lived with his family in the country, first in Berkshire and then at his father's old house, Combe Florey, in Somerset. After raising her family of two sons and two daughters, Teresa took a degree and made her own notable career as translator and novelist.</p> <p>By the 1980s, Waugh showed signs of restlessness, and looked for excuses to spend more time in London. When Ian Hislop became editor of Private Eye in 1986, Waugh left haughtily and abusively to take up the editorship of the Literary Review, a monthly owned, and heavily subsidised, by Naim Attallah. These later years were puzzling. Waugh devoted much energy to his beloved magazine, bullying all his friends to write for tiny fees, and he established an annual party for the magazine's Bad Sex Award, a back-handed prize for novels with excruciating sexual descriptions.</p> <p>And yet the truth was that the Literary Review was not so much bad as pointless. Equally, though Waugh was more prolific than ever, the columns he wrote for the Sunday Telegraph from 1980 and the Daily Telegraph from 1990 never quite matched the dash and bite of his best work for the Spectator or Private Eye.</p> <p>Part of the answer may have been that he was never quite at his best in national papers. But part was exhaustion. He kept working at a manic pace. Although he was earning more than most English journalists, Waugh seemed obsessed by the prospect of poverty, or at least by the need to provide for his family. Apart from the Thorpe book and his memoirs, the only books he published in his later years were collections from his various columns. He twice won the What the Papers Say Award for Columnist of the Year.</p> <p>To say that not everyone loved Bron Waugh would be an understatement. A certain kind of politician and journalist, often though not always female, found him repugnant, and his success incomprehensible. Such foes were baffled by the boyish camaraderie of old Fleet Street, not to say its tradition of ecumenical friendship: before he had a London flat of his own, Waugh used to stay with his great friend Paul Foot.</p> <p>In fact, apart from his vague dislike of male institutions, Waugh himself had many women friends. And he enjoyed holding court to pretty girls and jolly lads at the Academy Club, a bohemian joint he founded next to his office.</p> <p>Some of the more impassioned attacks on Waugh over the years appeared in the Guardian. Alexander Chancellor responded to one. He wasn't a disinterested witness: he had been a friend and colleague of Bron's for many years before their children Alexander Waugh and Liza Chancellor married. Nevertheless, when he wrote that Waugh was \"brave, generous, funny and an extremely skilful writer,\" it may not have been the whole story, but it was a large and true part of it.</p> <p>\u0095 Auberon Alexander Waugh, editor and writer, born November 17 1939; died January 16 2001</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,423759,00.html\">'Better to go than sit around being a terrible old bore'</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Auberon Waugh's death at the age of 61 is more sad than surprising. His immediate heredity wasn't promising - his father died at 62, his mother at 57 - and he suffered from ill-health all his life, partly resulting from severe wounds sustained during National Service at the age of 18. That may, in part, have accounted for the acidic personality which made him the most verbally brutal journalist of his age. Everyone who met him remarked on the contrast between his ferocity in print and his personal geniality, but this was hard to explain to those who didn't know him, especially if they had been on the rough end of his pen. Apart from health, his background shaped his career in one other respect. He spent much of his life trying to escape from the shadow of his father, the greatest English novelist of his age. This provided an obvious weapon for Auberon's enemies. Philip Larkin joked about \"my projected series, Talentless Sons of Famous Fathers - Waugh, Amis, Fuller...\", and for Polly Toynbee, \"Poor Bron is but a Randolph to a Winston.\" In fact, Auberon Waugh could be called many things, but not talentless, as he showed once he shook off that shadow. He was the second child and first son of Evelyn and Laura Waugh. Auberon Alexander - always Bron to those who knew him and to many who didn't - was born just as the war broke out, and just as his father was setting off on his quixotic and in the end bitterly thwarted search for military redemption. Bron barely saw his father until he was five, and even thereafter Evelyn boasted with chilling jocosity that he saw his children \"once a day for 10, I hope awe-inspiring, minutes\". After his father's death in 1966, Bron became his champion and continued many of his feuds. But his distinctly bleak autobiography Will This Do? (1991) casts a cold light on those early years, epitomised by the moment when father removed son's banana - a rare delicacy at the end of the war - from his plate and ate it. Coming clean, Bron would now admit that he had barely begun to like his father by the time of his death. For his part, Evelyn never concealed the boredom and vexation Bron caused him. Father wrote to 16-year-old son with considerable insight, \"You have a sense of humour and a gift of self- expression. On the other hand you are singularly imprudent and you have a defective sense of honour. These bad qualities can lead to disaster.\" Although Bron Waugh was often described as reactionary or rightwing, this missed the point about him personally as well as ideologically. If he was a Tory, he was a Tory anarchist, whose upbringing was a series of rebellions. He detested Downside, the Benedictine public school, quaintly claiming that the headmaster had \"set himself up in opposition to me\". He then loathed his National Service training, and never ceased to rail at the stupidity and brutality he had encountered at the Guards depot at Pirbright. Waugh was nevertheless commissioned into the Royal Horse Guards (The Blues), and sent to Cyprus. There one day he became annoyed by a fault in the Browning machine-gun of his armoured car, seized it by the muzzle and shook it, until it had fired several rounds through his chest at pointblank range. He was very lucky to survive. This later inspired one of his best columns, in the New Statesman. He had heard it said, Waugh wrote, that he had been shot by his own men, or that he had lost a testicle. In reality, the injury had been self-inflicted, and he had lost a lung, his spleen, several ribs, and a finger, \"but nothing else (my italics)\". While recuperating in Italy, he began his first novel. The Foxglove Saga (1960) was undoubtedly promising, and was undoubtedly helped by the name Waugh. It sold 14,000 in hardback, setting a mark for later disappointment. Waugh then went up briefly to Christ Church, Oxford, to which he had won an exhibition in English, to read PPE, but left after a year having failed to pass an exam, and taken a dislike to the academic authorities. After an unsuccessful attempt to join the Foreign Office - yet another part of the establishment which earned his undying enmity - he turned the obvious way. His early career in Fleet Street was chequered, working briefly for the Peterborough column on the Daily Telegraph, then joining the Daily Mirror. The highlight of his career as a Mirrorman was in 1967. During the Six Day war he flew to Israel, where Mandy Rice-Davies was said to have gone to the front as a nurse. In fact, she was pursuing her usual honest trade as a Tel Aviv night-club hostess but, in the best Scoop tradition, Waugh had her don a nurse's uniform for a photograph. He saw this as one of his proudest journalistic achievements, along with another some years later when a column of his in the Times, which included a flippant joke about the prophet Mohammed, led an enraged mob to burn down the British Council building in Rawalpindi. In 1967, he was made political columnist of the Spectator, an enterprising choice on the part of the then editor, Nigel Lawson. Waugh took his duties seriously enough, though attendance at Westminster only increased his aversion to politics and politicians. His time at the Spectator coincided with the Biafra war, when the Ibo-speaking, and largely Catholic, province seceded from Nigeria. This was the first serious cause to engage Waugh, who poured savage indignation on the Wilson government and Michael Stewart, the foreign secretary, for colluding at the conduct of the war, in which millions of Africans were starved into submission. In 1970, Waugh abruptly left the Spectator. He had been seeing the week's issue through the press, and on a whim changed George Gale's name to \"Lunchtime O'Gale\" in the contributors' list. When Lawson sacked him, Waugh sued for wrongful dismissal. After a court case worthy of Beachcomber, when Bernard Levin and Alan Watkins testified on his behalf, he surprisingly won damages of \u00a3600. Despite this, Lawson magnanimously re-employed Waugh as a novel reviewer, where he honed his talent for vituperation, which he later and even more brilliantly practised in the obscure magazine Books &amp; Bookmen. Like other \"slashing\" reviewers, he would point out that he often lavished praise on the writers he liked. These were far from predictable. One favourite was the Californian hippy novelist Richard Brautigan, another Angela Carter. And Martin Amis never forgot how \"very generous\" Waugh had been. In 1970 he found a natural billet at Private Eye. The \"Diary\" he wrote for the Eye over the next 16 years was unique, a combination of polemic, causerie, parody and fantasy. Those who liked it thought it very funny indeed, though its technique was partly pure abuse. Harold Wilson was an \"old crook\" (and a Soviet agent, Waugh sometimes suggested), with his \"revoltingly ugly\" colleague Barbara Castle. Not that Waugh was politically partisan. Heath was a buffoonish ninny, and Churchill a \"war criminal, mass murderer and persecutor of PG Wodehouse\". This taste for the calculatedly distasteful even extended to his wine columns: he compared one wine to \"a bunch of dead chrysanthemums on the grave of a still-born West Indian baby\". He ruthlessly used these columns, and the Spectator Wine Club, to stock his own cellar. Waugh was never squeamish about journalistic ethics. Once he discovered the delights of the \"freebie\", he gave breathless accounts of his trips to the Orient, and the wonderful \"Thai two-girl massage\". Sometimes his abuse was random. Watching television of an evening, Waugh caught the Tchaikovsky bio-pic, The Music Lovers. \"Hideous woman, dreadful film. One can't really blame Tchaikovsky for preferring boys. Anyone might become a homosexual who had once seen Glenda Jackson naked.\" But other diatribes were deliberate. Waugh had a truly Sicilian taste for vendetta, pursuing Lord Gowrie for decades because they had once competed, Gowrie successfully, for the same girl at Oxford. His tendresse for Tina Brown helped explain another long feud, with Harold Evans. His diatribes against Jimmy Goldsmith (on the possible size of whose \"organ\" he once dilated in print), or Shirley Williams, at any rate had no personal basis. If that sounded childish, Waugh's writing was valued by good judges. Anthony Howard took on Waugh for the New Statesman, where he wrote some of his best columns for what he imagined was his typical reader, a bad-tempered leftwing woman teacher in the Midlands. By now Waugh had finally given up fiction, after publishing five novels in all. He said that his novels were not selling any more and were not getting any better, though at least one, Consider the Lilies (1968) is still very funny and readable (the others are Path of Dalliance, 1963, Who Are the Violets Now, 1966, and A Bed of Flowers, 1971). Maybe the truth was that abandoning fiction was another way of escaping his father's shadow. Another was his increasingly detached attitude to Catholicism. Gradually he stopped going to church, later ceasing to be a practising or even believing Catholic. In 1976, the new editor of the Spectator, Alexander Chancellor, hired Waugh to write a weekly column. This decade, his own thirties, was perhaps the best of Waugh's writing life. His political as well as literary opinions were unpredictable. If he went on repetitiously about the \"foul-mouthed, dirty and drunk\" working classes, he disliked them not least because of their taste for punishment, especially capital punishment, which he abhorred. He also loathed war, and later opposed the Falklands, Gulf and Kosovo campaigns. In his idiosyncratic way, he was part of an authentic mood of revulsion against the bossy authoritarianism of left and right. Then he found another obsession. Jeremy Thorpe, the Liberal leader, had been caught up in a seamy scandal concerning a youth called Norman Scott, which led finally to Thorpe's departure as party leader and then his prosecution and acquittal. At the 1979 general election, Waugh stood against Thorpe in his North Devon constituency on behalf of the Dog Lovers' Party, an allusion to the strange episode when a hitman trying to frighten Scott, or worse, shot his pet dog. Waugh lost his deposit, but had the gratification of hearing Lord Denning say that his election address, which Thorpe had tried to suppress, could be published, and of seeing Thorpe lose his seat. Then Waugh published a book about the case, The Last Word. It showed his inability (shared by all the Eye gang) to understand the basic principles of justice, but it also supplied an appropriate note of black farce: as the journalist David Leigh said, Waugh gave a version of the affair in the style of Joe Orton. That North Devon constituency was near home for Waugh. He had married very young, in 1961, Lady Teresa Onslow, daughter of the Earl of Onslow, and lived with his family in the country, first in Berkshire and then at his father's old house, Combe Florey, in Somerset. After raising her family of two sons and two daughters, Teresa took a degree and made her own notable career as translator and novelist. By the 1980s, Waugh showed signs of restlessness, and looked for excuses to spend more time in London. When Ian Hislop became editor of Private Eye in 1986, Waugh left haughtily and abusively to take up the editorship of the Literary Review, a monthly owned, and heavily subsidised, by Naim Attallah. These later years were puzzling. Waugh devoted much energy to his beloved magazine, bullying all his friends to write for tiny fees, and he established an annual party for the magazine's Bad Sex Award, a back-handed prize for novels with excruciating sexual descriptions. And yet the truth was that the Literary Review was not so much bad as pointless. Equally, though Waugh was more prolific than ever, the columns he wrote for the Sunday Telegraph from 1980 and the Daily Telegraph from 1990 never quite matched the dash and bite of his best work for the Spectator or Private Eye. Part of the answer may have been that he was never quite at his best in national papers. But part was exhaustion. He kept working at a manic pace. Although he was earning more than most English journalists, Waugh seemed obsessed by the prospect of poverty, or at least by the need to provide for his family. Apart from the Thorpe book and his memoirs, the only books he published in his later years were collections from his various columns. He twice won the What the Papers Say Award for Columnist of the Year. To say that not everyone loved Bron Waugh would be an understatement. A certain kind of politician and journalist, often though not always female, found him repugnant, and his success incomprehensible. Such foes were baffled by the boyish camaraderie of old Fleet Street, not to say its tradition of ecumenical friendship: before he had a London flat of his own, Waugh used to stay with his great friend Paul Foot. In fact, apart from his vague dislike of male institutions, Waugh himself had many women friends. And he enjoyed holding court to pretty girls and jolly lads at the Academy Club, a bohemian joint he founded next to his office. Some of the more impassioned attacks on Waugh over the years appeared in the Guardian. Alexander Chancellor responded to one. He wasn't a disinterested witness: he had been a friend and colleague of Bron's for many years before their children Alexander Waugh and Liza Chancellor married. Nevertheless, when he wrote that Waugh was \"brave, generous, funny and an extremely skilful writer,\" it may not have been the whole story, but it was a large and true part of it. \u0095 Auberon Alexander Waugh, editor and writer, born November 17 1939; died January 16 2001 'Better to go than sit around being a terrible old bore'",

      "bodyText": "Lily Savage - the acid-tongued, cross-dressing host of ITV's Blankety Blank - is now officially a brand. Comedian Paul O'Grady, Lily's creator and alter ego, has registered the Lily Savage trade mark in 12 classes of product. These include cosmetics and beauty products, jewellery, leather - including imitation leather - alcoholic drinks, and even wigs. Lily joins a long line of entertainers and sport stars who have seen the value in registering their well-known names as brands. Linda McCartney trade-marked her vegetarian food recipes, Paul Newman his salad dressing, Rolf Harris his Stylophone, Bjorn Borg his underwear and Denise Van Outen her bikinis. Manchester United legend Eric Cantona even applied to the patent office to register the crowd chant \"Oooh, aaahh, Cantona!\" for use on boxer shorts, stationery and teaching materials. Twenty-first century icons to more recently jump on the bandwagon include England rugby captain Lawrence Dallaglio and footballer Alan Shearer. But while Alan Shearer duvets are all the rage in the north-east, it appears unlikely that a garish range of Lily Savage lipsticks is about to be launched in her native Liverpool. A spokeswoman for Mr O'Grady said the main reason for the registration was to protect the character against counterfeiters and rogue products. Ian Buchan of the Institute of Trade Mark Attorneys said: \"Paul O'Grady is doing the sensible thing in seeking trade mark protection for the remarkable character that he has developed. It is a valuable asset. \"While I can't actually see myself in a Lily Savage wig, I'm sure there are many people out there who would gladly buy such merchandise,\" he said.",

Academic institutions might attract more students from ethnic minority groups, if they were less culturally biased when considering applicants with similar academic grades suggested John Randall, the head of the quality assurance agency for higher education. The comments came during the second hearing of the House of Commons education committee's inquiry into student drop outs.

The community and the group spirit mean a lot: \"the Aquarian is involved with people, humanity is his thing!\" (Alan Oken). </p> <p> But Aquarians sometimes lock on to unconventional ideas which they refuse to give up on principle, whatever the opposition or the evidence. Starting with his 1999 Royal Television Society Lecture, Young has come out fighting for the cause of soaps in the betterment of society.

Most of us don't paralyse the local dope dealer by pushing him off a railway bridge (the current EastEnders plot), or bury troublesome people under the patio (Brookside). Here we hit a peculiarity common to Aquarians. Despite all their humanitarianism, an Aquarian is \"the most lovable robot in the world, but there's a bolt missing. This tragic bolt is the capacity for intimacy\" (Debbi Kempton-Smith). This is especially so in Mal Young's horoscope because he lacks water, the emotional element which engenders empathy and hooks the viewer, so despite all his clever Mr Soap ideas, he sometimes seriously loses the plot. </p> <p> He could be in danger of doing so again this year. Boundless Neptune is conjunct the Sun on his birthday, dominating the year. Its self-deceptive downside could give him confusing and unattainable goals, although strong Capricorn influences - bonnet soaps and historical dramas? - bring him benefits through tried and tested formulas. But if his Aquarian social conscience is really serious, this year Neptune calls his bluff as a redeemer. Phil Mitchell handing out hot soup to the homeless?

The black and scarlet coats were a striking contrast to the icy fields, while the horses' breath froze into clouds. The scene could have been taken from a painting, the title: The Hunters' Last Stand.</p> <p>Around 500 riders and thousands of unmounted supporters had rallied to the call of the Countryside Alliance, staging a meet to coincide with mass hunts in Cornwall and Wales. The narrow lanes around Higham, a village near Colchester in Essex, were lined with Land Rovers and horseboxes.</p> <p>With so many riders and such hard going over the frozen ground, the Essex and Suffolk hunt had little hope of catching a fox. The real quarry yesterday was the government. Their presence was a gesture of defiance and the last ditch attempt to dissuade MPs from voting for a ban.</p> <p>It was an impressive show, complete with celebrity supporter Robin Page, presenter of One Man and His Dog.</p> <p>But despite the smooth organisation and fighting mood, you sensed that many of those present had already abandoned hope. The world they spoke of preserving yesterday has already gone; hunting is one of its last vestiges. The values they cherish -stability, tradition, conservatism in all its senses - have been eroded by the forces of modern life.</p> <p>Age is a virtue here. Foxhunting is a 300-year-old sport, they tell you; there are hounds with pedigrees which can be traced back for 250 years. \"We welcome you all to this little part of God's acre where we all have three things in common,\" Ian Finch, secretary of the Essex and Suffolk hunt, told the crowd. \"We are all countrymen, we are all sportsmen and we all have absolute resolve to remain on the rural map forever and a day.</p> <p>\"We have a terrific inheritance from our forefathers which we have a duty to hand on to our children.

      "bodyText": "As the sound of a horn cut through the winter air, dogs streamed through the gates with riders close behind. The black and scarlet coats were a striking contrast to the icy fields, while the horses' breath froze into clouds. The scene could have been taken from a painting, the title: The Hunters' Last Stand. Around 500 riders and thousands of unmounted supporters had rallied to the call of the Countryside Alliance, staging a meet to coincide with mass hunts in Cornwall and Wales. The narrow lanes around Higham, a village near Colchester in Essex, were lined with Land Rovers and horseboxes. With so many riders and such hard going over the frozen ground, the Essex and Suffolk hunt had little hope of catching a fox. The real quarry yesterday was the government. Their presence was a gesture of defiance and the last ditch attempt to dissuade MPs from voting for a ban. It was an impressive show, complete with celebrity supporter Robin Page, presenter of One Man and His Dog. But despite the smooth organisation and fighting mood, you sensed that many of those present had already abandoned hope. The world they spoke of preserving yesterday has already gone; hunting is one of its last vestiges. The values they cherish -stability, tradition, conservatism in all its senses - have been eroded by the forces of modern life. Age is a virtue here. Foxhunting is a 300-year-old sport, they tell you; there are hounds with pedigrees which can be traced back for 250 years. \"We welcome you all to this little part of God's acre where we all have three things in common,\" Ian Finch, secretary of the Essex and Suffolk hunt, told the crowd. \"We are all countrymen, we are all sportsmen and we all have absolute resolve to remain on the rural map forever and a day. \"We have a terrific inheritance from our forefathers which we have a duty to hand on to our children. If we do not pull our weight now we will be guilty of a serious crime.\" Speaker after speaker pledged their willingness to break the law and go to jail if necessary. \"Mr Blair cannot lock us all up,\" said David Trotman, a huntsman for 32 years. \"We shall be here next year and the year after and the year after that.\" But their own rhetoric gave them away. Once they believed they spoke for England. Now they cast themselves as members of an oppressed minority denied their basic liberties. \"When the House of Commons debates and votes on the hunting bill we will almost certainly see prejudice and bigotry prevail over tolerance and good governance,\" read a message of support from Sam Butler, chairman of the Countryside Alliance's campaign for hunting. \"The public see this assault as anti-democratic, unnecessary and unfair.

      "bodyText": "Mobile phone retailer Carphone Warehouse has reported a massive surge in handset sales, but is remaining cautious about the year ahead. Despite reporting that Christmas sales soared by 81% to \u00a3124m, the UK's largest mobile phone retailer said it was \"confident\" its full-year results will meet expectations. One analyst described the retailer's caution as a \"mystery\", given that the notoriously fragile retail margins had not been affected by increased competition. \"People might be wondering if this is as good as it gets,\" said the analyst. Carphone's shares fell 2.5% to 211.5p in early trading. Today's sales figures come as no surprise, following record yuletide sales for UK mobile phone operators Vodafone, BT Cellnet and Orange. However, it has been a mixed start to the year for the industry, as handset makers Motorola and Nokia reported dissappointing results. Their sales figures increased speculation that the mobile phone market may be reaching saturation point, with over 405m handsets sold last year. But Carphone Warehouse, which owns over 1,000 stores, should benefit from the massive market for phone upgrades, which will be created by the roll-out of next-generation services.",

But it takes a keener eye to establish the differences between a home bird, academic green fiend, carefree, techno-careerist and wrong choice Charlie. The polling group Mori has produced classifications of students with similar views in a survey on university experience being published today. The classifications will be used and updated in annual surveys for Unite, a student accommodation company, which commissioned the poll. The survey showed that home birds are mostly female, over 26 and living at home. Academic green fiends study arts and sciences at an old university and are in higher education mainly because they want to learn more about a chosen subject. Wrong choice Charlies are at a new university that is not their first choice. Techno-careerists are privately educated and make greatest use of IT and see money spent on university as a good investment. Carefrees are younger, middle class and studying at an old university.

Asked why they had gone to university, most said it was either \"to gain qualifications\", or \"improve chances of getting a good job\". Just 21% said it was \"to learn more about the subjects in which I am interested\". Mori polled 1,103 full time undergraduate and postgraduate students at 22 universities in October and November.

Chose university as can live at home, and are happy with this arrangement \u0095 Most likely to be working part time, less likely to owe money and have least help from parents/partner \u0095 Course is most likely to have fallen short of expectations \u0095 Least likely to have gained confidence while at university Academic Green Fiends \u0095 More likely to study arts and sciences at an old university \u0095 More likely to have gone to university to learn more about chosen subject, to mix and to gain independence \u0095 Most likely to be happy with quality of teaching and expectations of course \u0095 Most likely to go travelling after university \u0095 Most likely to be interested in world issues and least likely to be concerned with money Wrong Choice Charlies \u0095 Most likely to be at a new university, which was not their first choice \u0095 More likely to have problems with course, people they live with and accommodation \u0095 Most likely to be worried about debts Techno-Careerists \u0095 More likely to have private education \u0095 More likely to be studying at an old university \u0095 Went to university to gain qualifications for chosen career \u0095 Most likely to measure success in financial terms, but hold more traditional values about religion and marriage \u0095 Make greatest use of IT and the internet Carefree \u0095 More likely to be younger, middle class and studying at an old university \u0095 University seen as a natural progression from school \u0095 Social life and getting away from home are best aspects. Positive view of university \u0095 Greater debts than other groups \u0095 Most likely to receive help from parents \u0095 Least interested in world issues and the environment",

      "body": "<p>If I had \u00a31 for every time someone has asked me, \"what is your favourite film of all time?\", I wouldn't be writing this. I would be relaxing somewhere hot, under my favourite palm tree. Film critics will probably have the same question fired at them by St Peter at the entrance to the Pearly Gates. Woe betide anyone who nominates Monty Python's Life of Brian. </p> <p>The question is, of course, unanswerable, since the reply depends on mood, date, time and the questioner. It is no use telling an Alien-lover some obscure Japanese film he or she has never heard of (though that does stop the conversation in its tracks, which might be a good thing). But 100 favourites? Now that is a different matter. </p> <p>But I am not so sure, now, that I have completed my list. I have come to the conclusion that I need another 100. Don't worry, I won't do it. But my guilt at leaving particular film-makers and films out gets stronger by the day. I asked one director's agent whether he would like to come to the launch of my book, based on the Guardian 100. \"Is one of his films included?\" came the wary answer. \"Er - no,\" I replied. I don't think the film-maker even got the message. That is embarrassing, particularly as I had set myself only two rules, designed to include as many directors as possible. </p> <p>The first rule was to restrict my choices to one film by each director. I feared that otherwise I would slap half a dozen John Ford or Luis Bu\u00f1uel movies on to the list, to the exclusion of even more film-makers than are already missed out. So I am constantly apologising, particularly to British directors. John Boorman, Mike Leigh, Terence Davies - you were nearly in, and probably should have been for, respectively, Point Blank, Naked, and Distant Voices, Still Lives. Mea culpa thrice over. </p> <p>The second rule was to consider the whole history of the cinema and as many countries as possible - because so much has been largely forgotten nowadays, at least in this country, where film is not generally regarded as an art with much of a history at all. I wanted to remind people, especially the multiplex generation, who have more than doubled cinema attendances in Britain over the past 20 years, that the cinema didn't actually start with Star Wars (though it did help to start the revival.) </p> <p>If you don't think that is necessary, consider the letter that the Guardian received from a reader who complained that I had reached 80 films and he still hadn't heard of a single one of them. He even went so far as to say that he would bet a friend that the same would apply by the time the list was completed. What? Never heard of Hitchcock's Vertigo, Scorsese's Raging Bull, Coppola's Apocalypse Now or Carol Reed's The Third Man? </p> <p>And consider a recent talk I gave to 30 teenage media students. \"Why did you choose so many old films?\", I was asked at question time. \"Because there were rather more great directors then than there are now, like John Ford and Orson Welles. Hands up who has heard of either?\" No hand went up for Ford, and only one for Welles. Their teacher then hurriedly borrowed the book. </p> <p>There are, I'll admit, some names among the 100 films that are obscure even to those who are familiar with most of the great names. But it is a critic's privilege to remember and remind. I think those films - like Santiago Alvarez's amazing shorts, shot when the Cuban revolution was at its height, or the Filipino director Lino Brocka's Manila: In The Claws of Darkness, about a country boy immersed within the corruption of the big city - shouldn't be forgotten, because they each had something important to say, and said it amazingly well. </p> <p>Another obscure work, Karoly Makk's Love, made in Hungary in 1971 and about a political prisoner returning home to his wife and mother after years of incarceration, was recently rescued from the legion of the lost at a major European festival, and hailed by everyone there as a masterpiece. That was after I had included it in the Guardian list, and I felt doubly justified. </p> <p>The point is that so much of the cinema's past has been lost or forgotten, and since the cinema has only been going for 100 years or so, it shouldn't have been. No other art form is so sketchily remembered. </p> <p>Ask Martin Scorsese, America's most important director, and he will tell you the same. He has been running campaigns to save this heritage for over 20 years, and has had some notable successes. But deep in the vaults of Hollywood, and elsewhere around the world, movies of considerable importance still lie mouldering in untended graves. Thanks to Scorsese and others - such as the cash-strapped British Film Archive - many of them have been saved. The coming of DVD, which is cheap for transfers, should help considerably too. </p> <p>And if the letter writer who had heard of none of my choices would even care to know, I recently met a distinguished European critic who also happened to be writing a 100 best list for his newspaper. To my astonishment, we had agreed on 68 of the choices - and he, too, hadn't got many of his 100 from the last 15 years or so. </p> <p>The age of my choices, I must agree, may be a valid criticism of my list. But I can only say that one needs a bit of time to go by before deciding whether a more or less contemporary film or film-maker can be measured among the greats. Things look different from afar, and you suddenly realise how good a movie is that was totally disregarded in its time, such as Stroheim's slaughtered Greed, cut down to a fifth of its original length, or Tod Browning's famous horror show, Freaks. You also discover that films you thought were wonderful don't stand up to a second or third viewing, and I can't tell you how many contemporary films fit that bill. </p> <p>This is not a golden age in which great film-makers can be nurtured and can thrive. It is now too expensive to make movies, and thus there is too much dependence on the big corporations, which approve most projects and try to make them pay. In America, your average \"big\" film costs around $60m. It costs the same amount to put it out and hype it up. That's well over $100m to be made before you can even think of breaking even. And how many movies achieve that without making a few compromises? </p> <p>Scorsese, for instance, has had only two outright successes at the box office: Taxi Driver and Goodfellas. The rest, like Raging Bull, one of my 100, barely make their money back. Or only do so after years, through video, television and cinema revivals. Hollywood, for so long the exemplar of great popular entertainment, now has to cater largely for the under-25s, who make up around 70% of its audiences. </p> <p>It does so with enormous skill, and sometimes widens the age of that audience considerably. But the situation usually doesn't make for great films - just movies which hopefully catch the transient mood of the times. \"Don't call me a Hollywood director,\" Scorsese once said. \"I'm an in-spite-of-Hollywood director.\" A lot of other film-makers would say Amen to that. </p> <p>And where are the European masters now? Most have gone to those Pearly Gates, and haven't been replaced. When I started out as Guardian film critic, there was Bergman, Bu\u00f1uel, Rossellini, Visconti, Fellini, Antonioni, Truffaut, Bresson, Godard, Tarkovsky and all, working at the height of their powers. At every London film festival it was possible to see two or three films which have now become classics. Now you are relieved to see a few goodish films. </p> <p>This isn't the view of a cynical old codger, but an unfortunate fact. </p> <p>We can all make mistakes, and 20 years hence will probably accord the films of some now comparatively unregarded directors a status we could not now imagine. </p> <p>But my list is not the 100 best. It is 100 of the best, which is a slightly different thing - personal favourites, which I hope I have good reasons to celebrate. I couldn't go, for instance, without Laurel and Hardy, at whom some perfectly reasonable people scarcely smile, let alone laugh. </p> <p>But I can't actually say any of their films, including Sons of the Desert, my choice, should be accorded the title of masterpiece - whatever that means - with the exception of The Music Box, a short film in which they attempt to deliver a piano to a customer up a steep stone stairway. That got them their only Oscar, and certainly is a masterpiece. </p> <p>Some have suggested that mine is an anti-American, or rather anti-Hollywood, list. And I suppose it could be thought so, were it not for the fact that the principal task in my own mind was to try to persuade film-goers who don't already know that there really is such a thing as world cinema, and that great films have come from all parts, not just America. But having said all that, there are 31 American films in the 100 - a larger number than from any other country, although not all the Hollywood choices were actually directed by Americans. </p> <p>There is considerable truth in the theory, once put to me by the American director and writer, Paul Schrader, that Hollywood is world cinema, since so many talents from all over the world have made films there. It is certainly by far the greatest source of popular entertainment in the film business. </p> <p>But there are others things than Hollywood movies, and many of the best from elsewhere are only labelled \"arthouse fare\" here because they aren't in the English language. It would be a brave exhibitor, for instance, who placed Les Enfants Du Paradis in a multiplex now, or even in a commercial British cinema at the time it was made. But though directed and written by great artists (Marcel Carn\u00e9 and Jacques Pr\u00e9vert), it was to ordinary people in France what Gone With The Wind was to those in America - a popular film that could be seen again and again, along with the buffs. </p> <p>But then the division between art and commerce in the cinema has always been a bugbear of mine. It stops many people seeing the films that are made by great directors, who just happen to work in a foreign language, and it also stops others from even trying to appreciate popular culture. </p> <p>All I can do is to repeat the old, old adage: Let all the flowers in the garden bloom. A good many of them, I think, are in my 100 favourites.</p>",

We can all make mistakes, and 20 years hence will probably accord the films of some now comparatively unregarded directors a status we could not now imagine. But my list is not the 100 best. It is 100 of the best, which is a slightly different thing - personal favourites, which I hope I have good reasons to celebrate. I couldn't go, for instance, without Laurel and Hardy, at whom some perfectly reasonable people scarcely smile, let alone laugh. But I can't actually say any of their films, including Sons of the Desert, my choice, should be accorded the title of masterpiece - whatever that means - with the exception of The Music Box, a short film in which they attempt to deliver a piano to a customer up a steep stone stairway. That got them their only Oscar, and certainly is a masterpiece. Some have suggested that mine is an anti-American, or rather anti-Hollywood, list. And I suppose it could be thought so, were it not for the fact that the principal task in my own mind was to try to persuade film-goers who don't already know that there really is such a thing as world cinema, and that great films have come from all parts, not just America. But having said all that, there are 31 American films in the 100 - a larger number than from any other country, although not all the Hollywood choices were actually directed by Americans. There is considerable truth in the theory, once put to me by the American director and writer, Paul Schrader, that Hollywood is world cinema, since so many talents from all over the world have made films there. It is certainly by far the greatest source of popular entertainment in the film business. But there are others things than Hollywood movies, and many of the best from elsewhere are only labelled \"arthouse fare\" here because they aren't in the English language. It would be a brave exhibitor, for instance, who placed Les Enfants Du Paradis in a multiplex now, or even in a commercial British cinema at the time it was made. But though directed and written by great artists (Marcel Carn\u00e9 and Jacques Pr\u00e9vert), it was to ordinary people in France what Gone With The Wind was to those in America - a popular film that could be seen again and again, along with the buffs. But then the division between art and commerce in the cinema has always been a bugbear of mine. It stops many people seeing the films that are made by great directors, who just happen to work in a foreign language, and it also stops others from even trying to appreciate popular culture. All I can do is to repeat the old, old adage: Let all the flowers in the garden bloom. A good many of them, I think, are in my 100 favourites.",

She and TV presenter Kate Thornton will star in a new travel series set in Canada. The show has been billed as a cross between road movies Thelma and Louise and Priscilla, Queen of the Desert. Appleton, who is poised to leave the band with her sister Natalie, made the approach to the BBC personally. The deal with such a big star comes at a crucial period for BBC Choice, which from tonight will face direct competion from Channel 4's entertainment channel E4. Channel 4's new station features a series of heavy-hitting stars including Ali G, cult magician David Blain and all of Warner Brothers's hit series including ER, Friends and Ally McBeal. The travel series will be one of the linchpins of the first winter schedule for BBC3, which is expected to start at the end of this year or early 2002. In the series, Appleton and Thornton will travel from Toronto to Vancouver in silver Winnebagos. She has promised that her boyfriend, Oasis badboy Liam Gallagher, will also appear in the series, which will be filmed in September. Samantha Janus and Donna Air will also feature in the \u00a31m series.",

We came to know her when she was commissioned by the National Portrait Gallery to paint a group of us who worked on the Guardian women's page in the 1970s and 80s. It was an extraordinary and unexpected commission - both for her and for us, though she had already won distinguished prizes by then.</p> <p>We were, of course, astonished and flattered by the idea, which came about when Claire Tomalin, the feminist writer and biographer, joined the NPG board. Pacing the galleries, Claire had noted wryly how many contemporary men and how few women hung on its walls, and she set about commissioning more women.</p> <p>She proposed that a portrait of Guardian women should be painted by a leading young woman artist. So there it now hangs. On the right hand side sits Mary Stott, the founder of the first and only serious and feminist women's page in the days when \"women\" used to mean woollies, jellies and sillies.

      "bodyText": "How sad to learn of the death of the very talented painter Sarah Raphael. We came to know her when she was commissioned by the National Portrait Gallery to paint a group of us who worked on the Guardian women's page in the 1970s and 80s. It was an extraordinary and unexpected commission - both for her and for us, though she had already won distinguished prizes by then. We were, of course, astonished and flattered by the idea, which came about when Claire Tomalin, the feminist writer and biographer, joined the NPG board. Pacing the galleries, Claire had noted wryly how many contemporary men and how few women hung on its walls, and she set about commissioning more women. She proposed that a portrait of Guardian women should be painted by a leading young woman artist. So there it now hangs. On the right hand side sits Mary Stott, the founder of the first and only serious and feminist women's page in the days when \"women\" used to mean woollies, jellies and sillies. Now 93, all her gleaming marbles as bright as ever, she is still the resolutely unvain, unvarnished editor who was sometimes mistaken for a bag lady. Liz Forgan, whose legs we always thought were unjustly prominent in the picture, was women's editor from 1978 to 1981 and our convert: she arrived regarding the job as a temporary irritation on the way to more serious things, but underwent a Damascene conversion to feminist ideas and stayed to become one of the best editors ever. Posy Simmonds, on the far left, is the cartoonist who made the page compulsive reading with her long-running strip: her recent Emma Bovary is every bit as clever and perceptive. I am the one leaning over the back of the sofa where Jill Tweedie - the doyenne - was slowly dying of motor neurone disease. Jill was the centre of the painting, the centre of our thoughts then and the fount of energy, wit and wisdom that made the pages remarkable. It was not going to be easy for Sarah to ease herself into our group. The sittings were intense; Jill was weak, but full of passion, indignation and jokes. Sarah sat on the floor cross-legged in one corner and was a delightful extra presence, warm and sympathetic, as we reminisced, drank much wine and enjoyed the last chance to spend long hours with Jill. Sarah fell quickly under Jill's magnetic influence and loved the commission, spending far longer on the sittings than she had planned. For those months we came to know her well too, through those long conversations that went on into the dusk in Jill's sitting room.

      "body": "<p>At around 9am on May 22 1996, I stood at the door of a Bristol maternity unit, gazing through a locked glass door at Eleanor Ruth Penelope Roser, my first grandchild. The door was an uncomfortable symbol of the fact that, in reproductive terms, things had moved on. I was now firmly in the back seat.</p> <p>This I had to work out, painfully, over the coming days of cooking and cleaning at my daughter's house. But at that moment I was simply moved - and bemused - by the sight of the crumple-faced scrap lying in the arms of the woman whom I'd held as an equally frail scrap in my arms such a short time before. Oh, the heartbreaking brevity of it. I imagine most women feel this, in some way, at first sight of their first grandchild.</p> <p>In my case, there was the added poignancy of the early demise of all previous grandmothers in my mother's family. I was the first woman in four generations to know the pleasure of belonging to three generations of women. When I decided to make a book about grandmothers, it was largely in order to find myself a role model. My paternal grandmother, 88 when I was born, hardly figured. I didn't have a clue.</p> <p>It surprised me during my research to find how bemused many women now are - even those who've grown up with grandmothers. Things have changed for everyone; not least through the simple fact that, with increased longevity, we grandmothers have lost our rarity value. In 1900, only one in four people would have had four living grandparents. By 1976, two out of three did. One of my two granddaughters has all four; the other has three. Both have a living great-grandfather. Emily, the younger, has a great-grandmother besides.</p> <p>On top of that, any special knowledge we grandmothers might have had has been superseded by technology - who uses terry-towel nappies and safety-pins now? Our role as a daughter's helpmeet has equally been superseded by their ever more involved partners. It is not just our daughters and daughters-in-law (or out-law) we have to tread carefully with now in matters of child-rearing. It's our sons, also.</p> <p>One lasting memory of the first few days of Ellie's life was hearing my daughter and her partner in animated discussion with the health visitor about the colour of her shit. I, of course, belonged - choking with laughter - on the other side of the door. As Phyllida Law, one of my informants, said, succinctly, you have to edit yourself. Indeed. And fast.</p> <p>Nor do many of us fit the old stereotypes - if we ever did. Even in the 19th century I discovered some far-from-staid grandmothers. But now nobody expects us to look and dress like \"the older woman\". We work. We run. We go to the gym. We travel, often singly, to unlikely places - I, this Christmas, went by fairly rough means to Timbuktu. We take lovers and even the partnerless are nowadays urged in manuals aimed at the over-60s to enjoy themselves via masturbation.</p> <p>Above all, we think about where we're at, and write about it. In her autobiography, the anthropologist Margaret Mead commiserated with us on never being able to take ourselves, as grandmothers, for granted. It is hard work. On the other hand, we the generation that came of age with feminism have, throughout our lives, articulated areas of women's lives previously unarticulated, considered unseemly on the one hand, and too commonplace to be interesting, on the other. These range from menstruation to loss of virginity, to the more intimate and emotional sides of sexual partnerships - heterosexual and homosexual - to childbirth, divorce, and, as we've grown older, to the menopause and, now, grandmotherhood.</p> <p>Ironically enough, however particular our take on it, this place we've reached now leads us back to a much less particular, more fundamental matter: biology. Some of us are ill already. Even those who've managed to stay fit and well cannot deny the fact that though we may not feel old, we are ageing. Our sense of mortality is augmented by a not new, but fuller recognition that our adult lives contain completely the lives of the new parents, our children. We realise, seeing their children begin their lives, that we are that much nearer the ends of ours.</p> <p>For our grandchildren, that is our importance. We provide a sense of generations, the lack of which impoverished me. My granddaughters' gain from seeing their mother's or father's relationships with us, their mothers. Margaret Mead quoted the idea that a unit of human time is the space between the memory of grandparent and grandchild. I never saw my mother with her mother or knew what was held deep in my grandmother's memory.</p> <p>But I make sure that Ellie begins to know what mine holds. For her, at four, the childhood of her mother, let alone mine, is unimaginably long ago. But I can help shift her perception a little. When she's playing me up and wails: \"I want my mummy,\" I wail back: \"And I want my little girl.\" And I watch her stop, think and realise - with all the implications - that her mother and my little girl are one and the same person.</p> <p>As to how to be a grandmother, I sigh wearily at manuals suggesting I turn myself into an alternative kindergarten. We are all different. What I am is a storyteller, so I tell my grandchildren stories. Just as another grandmother I met the other day - a landscape historian - takes her granddaughter round Birmingham canals and discovers with her the different kinds of drain covers and bridges. Ellie's other grandmother is more patient than I am and cooks with her. I have a picture of Ellie whisking up egg whites for meringues, not something she's ever likely to do around me.</p> <p>I am equally aware of what my grandchildren give me. Precisely because I know how brief babyhood and childhood are and precisely because I am (thankfully) not bound up with the day-to-day routine of childcare, I appreciate, as I did not with my own children, where each child is now, at this moment. To be around small children again at a time in my life when I feel myself swept towards its ending comes with the welcome recognition that life renews itself endlessly, with or without me.</p> <p>It is also a wonderful excuse to be silly. Ellie and I play at bears in the bed, growling at each other. We skip wildly together along the pavement. We go down slides, side by side. We pretend we're both clockwork and have to be wound up before we start walking. Her smaller cousin, Emily, even insisted on climbing into the bath with me the other day and playing fishes. Despite the endless ailments they pass on to me, a much less touted aspect of grandparent hood - poor George Sand caught whooping cough from her grandchildren - it feels like pure privilege.</p> <p>It feels the more so because I know that grandparenthood can be no fun in other families, other parts of the world. Not all grandmas are fit, let alone carefree. Some are crippled by arthritis. Some become demented. For my book, I found accounts of heroic grandparents struggling to bring up the children of their Aids-stricken young, and distressing reports of granny abuse at home and in hospital.</p> <p>Too many grandparents, I discovered, never see their grandchildren after family break-up. Others have poverty-stricken children who don't acknowledge the aged parents they can't afford to support. A recent newsletter about the grandmother I sponsor in southern India announced that she is happy because, now she is provided for, her children dare visit her again. That leaves me very sober. And feeling still luckier.</p> <p>Last time I visited my younger granddaughter, she rushed to the door shouting, \"My Pennepy.\" Last time I saw the older one, we walked down to the local city farm together and she said: \"I was absolutely dying to see you, actually.\" They seem like the greatest compliments in the world.</p> <p>\u0095 The Virago Book of Grandmothers: An Autobiographical Anthology, written and compiled by Penelope Farmer, is published by Virago at \u00a317.99.</p>",

In her autobiography, the anthropologist Margaret Mead commiserated with us on never being able to take ourselves, as grandmothers, for granted. It is hard work. On the other hand, we the generation that came of age with feminism have, throughout our lives, articulated areas of women's lives previously unarticulated, considered unseemly on the one hand, and too commonplace to be interesting, on the other. These range from menstruation to loss of virginity, to the more intimate and emotional sides of sexual partnerships - heterosexual and homosexual - to childbirth, divorce, and, as we've grown older, to the menopause and, now, grandmotherhood. Ironically enough, however particular our take on it, this place we've reached now leads us back to a much less particular, more fundamental matter: biology. Some of us are ill already. Even those who've managed to stay fit and well cannot deny the fact that though we may not feel old, we are ageing. Our sense of mortality is augmented by a not new, but fuller recognition that our adult lives contain completely the lives of the new parents, our children. We realise, seeing their children begin their lives, that we are that much nearer the ends of ours. For our grandchildren, that is our importance. We provide a sense of generations, the lack of which impoverished me. My granddaughters' gain from seeing their mother's or father's relationships with us, their mothers. Margaret Mead quoted the idea that a unit of human time is the space between the memory of grandparent and grandchild. I never saw my mother with her mother or knew what was held deep in my grandmother's memory. But I make sure that Ellie begins to know what mine holds. For her, at four, the childhood of her mother, let alone mine, is unimaginably long ago. But I can help shift her perception a little. When she's playing me up and wails: \"I want my mummy,\" I wail back: \"And I want my little girl.\" And I watch her stop, think and realise - with all the implications - that her mother and my little girl are one and the same person. As to how to be a grandmother, I sigh wearily at manuals suggesting I turn myself into an alternative kindergarten. We are all different. What I am is a storyteller, so I tell my grandchildren stories. Just as another grandmother I met the other day - a landscape historian - takes her granddaughter round Birmingham canals and discovers with her the different kinds of drain covers and bridges. Ellie's other grandmother is more patient than I am and cooks with her. I have a picture of Ellie whisking up egg whites for meringues, not something she's ever likely to do around me. I am equally aware of what my grandchildren give me. Precisely because I know how brief babyhood and childhood are and precisely because I am (thankfully) not bound up with the day-to-day routine of childcare, I appreciate, as I did not with my own children, where each child is now, at this moment. To be around small children again at a time in my life when I feel myself swept towards its ending comes with the welcome recognition that life renews itself endlessly, with or without me. It is also a wonderful excuse to be silly. Ellie and I play at bears in the bed, growling at each other. We skip wildly together along the pavement. We go down slides, side by side. We pretend we're both clockwork and have to be wound up before we start walking. Her smaller cousin, Emily, even insisted on climbing into the bath with me the other day and playing fishes. Despite the endless ailments they pass on to me, a much less touted aspect of grandparent hood - poor George Sand caught whooping cough from her grandchildren - it feels like pure privilege. It feels the more so because I know that grandparenthood can be no fun in other families, other parts of the world. Not all grandmas are fit, let alone carefree. Some are crippled by arthritis. Some become demented. For my book, I found accounts of heroic grandparents struggling to bring up the children of their Aids-stricken young, and distressing reports of granny abuse at home and in hospital. Too many grandparents, I discovered, never see their grandchildren after family break-up. Others have poverty-stricken children who don't acknowledge the aged parents they can't afford to support. A recent newsletter about the grandmother I sponsor in southern India announced that she is happy because, now she is provided for, her children dare visit her again. That leaves me very sober. And feeling still luckier. Last time I visited my younger granddaughter, she rushed to the door shouting, \"My Pennepy.\" Last time I saw the older one, we walked down to the local city farm together and she said: \"I was absolutely dying to see you, actually.\" They seem like the greatest compliments in the world. \u0095 The Virago Book of Grandmothers: An Autobiographical Anthology, written and compiled by Penelope Farmer, is published by Virago at \u00a317.99.",

      "body": "<p>'Buddha, Joan of Arc and the spirit of all who believe in God live in the White House,\" Spencer Tracy was made to say in State of the Union, a dreadful film made by Frank Capra in 1948. It was the logical conclusion to the Sicilian immigrant's admiration for America, which admittedly produced much better movies, such as It Happened One Night and Mr Deeds Goes to Town.</p> <p>But even these affectionately remembered films look naive and sentimental now, despite the evident skill of their making. The former won Capra the Oscars he craved. He called them \"my holy grail\". Shrewd and talented as he was, Capra's espousal of the virtues of the little man reek of whimsy and wishful thinking and, though we were once taken in by their sheer entertainment value, they remain among American cinema's most cosily absurd fables.</p> <p>Not long after he made State of the Union, this somewhat unpleasing man was convinced that the America he once loved, and who had once loved his work, had been taken over by gays, druggies and draft dodgers. Unfortunately, he funked making a movie about that.</p> <p>But, much earlier in his pretty long career, he did make one extraordinary film.

      "bodyText": "'Buddha, Joan of Arc and the spirit of all who believe in God live in the White House,\" Spencer Tracy was made to say in State of the Union, a dreadful film made by Frank Capra in 1948. It was the logical conclusion to the Sicilian immigrant's admiration for America, which admittedly produced much better movies, such as It Happened One Night and Mr Deeds Goes to Town. But even these affectionately remembered films look naive and sentimental now, despite the evident skill of their making. The former won Capra the Oscars he craved. He called them \"my holy grail\". Shrewd and talented as he was, Capra's espousal of the virtues of the little man reek of whimsy and wishful thinking and, though we were once taken in by their sheer entertainment value, they remain among American cinema's most cosily absurd fables. Not long after he made State of the Union, this somewhat unpleasing man was convinced that the America he once loved, and who had once loved his work, had been taken over by gays, druggies and draft dodgers. Unfortunately, he funked making a movie about that. But, much earlier in his pretty long career, he did make one extraordinary film. It was called The Bitter Tea of General Yen, an exotic fable that showed him capable of what producer Harry Cohn called \"the sort of arty junk that wins Oscars\". It was neither arty nor junk, but a very skilful adaptation of a novel about a prim New England girl (Barbara Stanwyck) who arrives in Shanghai to marry a tight-arsed missionary as civil war breaks out. Attempting to save some children, she gets knocked flat and wakes up in the train of a notorious Chinese warlord (Nils Asther). Taken to his summer palace, and held by the fascinated infidel, she starts trying to convert him.

There's always a scene or two involving one cast member breaking the worst news to a grieving relative. Another in which a nervous neophyte has to do something grisly with a tube or needle, then either funks it or saves the day. Plus, hopping from background to foreground, some macabre mass accident, involving a dozen blood-drenched casualties, dressed as Vikings, Pilgrim Fathers or Santa Claus. </p> <p>Many new viewers feel nauseous after an ER encounter. This is only partially due to the litres of blood lapping around the set. Put bluntly, ER is a confusing experience.

But the precise nature of the hospital hierarchy is a mystery to most, as are - in a busy episode - the differences between the characters. </p> <p>The core cast is unwieldy - some 12 doctors and nurses, plus eight support staff. Writers who can keep all these people in our consciousness, and tell several stories in 40 minutes, are rarer than state-registered alchemists. There's also the additional problem that, in a high-action emergency situation, there's a limited range of ways in which a character can act. They have to get on with their jobs, after all, or they wouldn't be there. </p> <p>Of course there are well-drawn characters in ER. The wealthy recovering drug addict Dr Carter. The gruff but kindhearted Dr Benton, intent on self-advancement but ever pricked by his conscience. But this isn't soap. There might be an occasional visit to the diner across the road, but for the greater part, ER is \"precinct drama\" - the action limited to the workplace and seldom visiting characters' outside lives. Who even knows why Dr Weaver has a walking-stick? </p> <p>In fact, ER's success occurs because, rather than in spite of, these problems. Soaps can overload us with details about a person's life. But in precinct drama, glimpses of character become treats, made precious by being rarer. </p> <p>Remember the interest sparked when Dr Weaver's African lover, Mlungisi, came to visit.

A story about a miscarriage becomes relevant only when a nurse or doctor is pregnant, or in some related situation. This principle is at the core of every ER episode.

So a doctor who's studied hard to escape the ghetto has to turn away poor patients. Another, recently bereaved, deals with the implications of a DNR order (Do Not Resuscitate). </p> <p>And aside from the odd schmaltzy moment where the resident heart-throb cradles a baby, ER tells these stories in a bold manner. In a cautious TV-world, it's never afraid to tackle issues like AIDS, racism and homophobia head-on. This courage ensures that, whatever the formula, viewers are continually challenged. It's mirrored in the producers' readiness to experiment with the form - the live episode, Tarantino's guest-directed piece. </p> <p>So viewers of tonight's episode might feel that the tale of a certain doctor's divorce becomes engulfed by the usual tidal wave of saline fluid and fresh cadavers.

      "body": "<p>There are some words and phrases that are so quaint, so outdated that they make me literally shiver with glee. \"Living in sin\" is one; \"liberty bodice\" is another. And this week Barbara Castle, one of the greatest women of our age, came out with one I thought was surely lost and gone for ever: \"man-haters\".</p> <p>Oh, glory! The giggly, girly reality of modern me-too feminism recedes and once more we are faced with a monstrous regiment of dungareed sirens, charred bras borne proudly aloft, underarms unshaven, copies of the Scum Manifesto to the ready, chalking boldly on bare walls that A WOMAN NEEDS A MAN LIKE A FISH NEEDS A BIKE.</p> <p>Trouble is, they became extinct 30 years ago. That doesn't stop Barbara from wading in and having a bash, as is her wont. \"One of the biggest dangers women face today are men-haters,\" she said earlier this week. \"I love men. If there's a great deal of love you can get a great many things done. You don't have to be a man-hater to be a successful woman. In fact, all it can do is impede your progress.\"</p> <p>This statement may seem preposterous on first, second or even third reading, but dash it, she's right, you know. Look at that first sentence and just think about it for a moment. When it's two in the morning and you can't get a taxi and you're walking home and you hear footsteps behind you, you do instinctively think, \"Oh my god, it's one of those Men-Haters! Everyone knows they're one of the biggest dangers women face today. Any minute now she's going to run up to me and spin me round and rub my lipstick off AND STICK A FALSE MOUSTACHE ON ME! Quick - I'd better find a MAN!\"</p> <p>And dig that third sentence. She's a wise old bird, is Babs. You can tell she's thinking about the suffragettes and how they got us the vote. They didn't do anything unpleasant like smashing windows, setting postboxes on fire, slashing nude paintings and yelling \"VOTES FOR WOMEN AND CHASTITY FOR MEN!\", did they? Course not!</p> <p>They got in there, old Emmeline, Christabel and Sylvia, and gave Lloyd George and his cabinet a whole lot of neck rubs, foot massages and savoury snacks because, like Barbara, they knew that a) the way to a man's heart is through his stomach and b) if there's a great deal of love you can get many things done. Sensible, those Pankhursts; knew the importance of Pussy Power every time.</p> <p>But it's the second sentence that's the real giveaway: I LOVE MEN. Only one sort of woman ever has the brass neck to say this; and it's a woman in her 80s or 90s like Castle or her fellow Barbara, Cartland, who spent her entire life kicking men into touch, breaking their balls and generally making their lives a misery, as Castle has rightly done in the pursuit of her radical vision and as Cartland did in order to achieve the lifestyle she felt she was born for. Between them, they have probably bossed more men into early graves than the entire Lesbian Nation.</p> <p>But then, as they get older, they want to be seen as all soft and cuddly and feminine, which is a bit difficult when you can't wring out a drop of oestrogen to save your life. So they resort to these sad, man-pleasing tactics; belittling other, younger women in order to bolster their own sense of femininity.</p> <p>It's sad that 40 years ago Barbara Castle would have happily agreed with Rebecca West's definitive statement about feminism: \"I only know that people call me a feminist whenever I express sentiments that differentiate me from a doormat or a prostitute.\" For feminist, substitute man-hater.</p> <p>Shamefully, when women attempt to finger other woman (oo-er!) as man-haters, the implication also is that they are lesbians, and therefore not \"qualified\" to speak out on the mysterious, wondrous beauty of, say, men beating women to within an inch of their lives.</p> <p>Just last week Carol Sarler said as much about the magnificent Julie Bindel of Justice For Women in the Express. But this is as dumb as saying that a gay man can't be a gynaecologist because he has no practical experience of female genitalia. I know it's a bit of a cliche, but when women make such a to-do about man-haters and dykes, you really have to wonder how many of their own feelings they've repressed, and if they don't fancy a bit of dyke action themselves. It's like: \"Aaagh! Big hairy lesbians - PLEASE!\"</p> <p>Besides, the number of professional feminists who are gay is minuscule; you'll find a higher proportion of gay models, nuns or housewives. And as for real man-haters, they are - curiously - largely to be found in the man-pleasing sector of society. You'll never meet a lap dancer, phone sex worker or prostitute who doesn't despise men, while those ultra-feminine women who write manuals on how to successfully \"catch\" a man seem to see them as nothing more than walking wallets.</p> <p>Oh dear (snigger), surely that can't be right - that the more sexual contact women have with men, the more they hate them? Quick - the smelling salts for Baroness Castle!</p> <p>When the six o'clock news is a litany of men being oppressed, murdered and raped by women; when a female Taliban confines Afghan men to their homes; when African women emasculate boy children and call it \"tradition\"; when two men a week are routinely killed by their female partners; when boys are monthly molested, strangled and left to die in a ditch by female assailants; when the female equivalent of Eminem becomes the world's fastest selling popular singer with her songs about killing and mutilating men - come to me then, Barbara, and complain about man-haters.</p> <p>Until that day, concern yourself with the reality: that every day, in every way, in every country and in every culture, men are hating women to death. And getting away with it.</p>",

That doesn't stop Barbara from wading in and having a bash, as is her wont. \"One of the biggest dangers women face today are men-haters,\" she said earlier this week. \"I love men. If there's a great deal of love you can get a great many things done. You don't have to be a man-hater to be a successful woman. In fact, all it can do is impede your progress.\" This statement may seem preposterous on first, second or even third reading, but dash it, she's right, you know. Look at that first sentence and just think about it for a moment. When it's two in the morning and you can't get a taxi and you're walking home and you hear footsteps behind you, you do instinctively think, \"Oh my god, it's one of those Men-Haters! Everyone knows they're one of the biggest dangers women face today. Any minute now she's going to run up to me and spin me round and rub my lipstick off AND STICK A FALSE MOUSTACHE ON ME! Quick - I'd better find a MAN!\" And dig that third sentence. She's a wise old bird, is Babs. You can tell she's thinking about the suffragettes and how they got us the vote. They didn't do anything unpleasant like smashing windows, setting postboxes on fire, slashing nude paintings and yelling \"VOTES FOR WOMEN AND CHASTITY FOR MEN!\", did they? Course not! They got in there, old Emmeline, Christabel and Sylvia, and gave Lloyd George and his cabinet a whole lot of neck rubs, foot massages and savoury snacks because, like Barbara, they knew that a) the way to a man's heart is through his stomach and b) if there's a great deal of love you can get many things done. Sensible, those Pankhursts; knew the importance of Pussy Power every time. But it's the second sentence that's the real giveaway: I LOVE MEN. Only one sort of woman ever has the brass neck to say this; and it's a woman in her 80s or 90s like Castle or her fellow Barbara, Cartland, who spent her entire life kicking men into touch, breaking their balls and generally making their lives a misery, as Castle has rightly done in the pursuit of her radical vision and as Cartland did in order to achieve the lifestyle she felt she was born for. Between them, they have probably bossed more men into early graves than the entire Lesbian Nation. But then, as they get older, they want to be seen as all soft and cuddly and feminine, which is a bit difficult when you can't wring out a drop of oestrogen to save your life. So they resort to these sad, man-pleasing tactics; belittling other, younger women in order to bolster their own sense of femininity. It's sad that 40 years ago Barbara Castle would have happily agreed with Rebecca West's definitive statement about feminism: \"I only know that people call me a feminist whenever I express sentiments that differentiate me from a doormat or a prostitute.\" For feminist, substitute man-hater. Shamefully, when women attempt to finger other woman (oo-er!) as man-haters, the implication also is that they are lesbians, and therefore not \"qualified\" to speak out on the mysterious, wondrous beauty of, say, men beating women to within an inch of their lives. Just last week Carol Sarler said as much about the magnificent Julie Bindel of Justice For Women in the Express. But this is as dumb as saying that a gay man can't be a gynaecologist because he has no practical experience of female genitalia. I know it's a bit of a cliche, but when women make such a to-do about man-haters and dykes, you really have to wonder how many of their own feelings they've repressed, and if they don't fancy a bit of dyke action themselves. It's like: \"Aaagh! Big hairy lesbians - PLEASE!\" Besides, the number of professional feminists who are gay is minuscule; you'll find a higher proportion of gay models, nuns or housewives. And as for real man-haters, they are - curiously - largely to be found in the man-pleasing sector of society. You'll never meet a lap dancer, phone sex worker or prostitute who doesn't despise men, while those ultra-feminine women who write manuals on how to successfully \"catch\" a man seem to see them as nothing more than walking wallets. Oh dear (snigger), surely that can't be right - that the more sexual contact women have with men, the more they hate them? Quick - the smelling salts for Baroness Castle! When the six o'clock news is a litany of men being oppressed, murdered and raped by women; when a female Taliban confines Afghan men to their homes; when African women emasculate boy children and call it \"tradition\"; when two men a week are routinely killed by their female partners; when boys are monthly molested, strangled and left to die in a ditch by female assailants; when the female equivalent of Eminem becomes the world's fastest selling popular singer with her songs about killing and mutilating men - come to me then, Barbara, and complain about man-haters. Until that day, concern yourself with the reality: that every day, in every way, in every country and in every culture, men are hating women to death. And getting away with it.",

      "body": "<p>Sarah Raphael, who has died aged 40, was perfectly poised to establish herself as a brilliant society portraitist, like Emma Sargent, with an assured, highly lucrative career. She did not want this. She wanted to make her own way as a painter, on her own terms, rejecting the silver spoon she had been handed from her wealthy and cultivated family background.</p> <p>As with many artists, drawing and making paintings was a crucial part of her life from earliest childhood. As a little girl aged seven, she was dazzled by the beauty of the Greek island Ios, where she lived with her family.

She did not want this. She wanted to make her own way as a painter, on her own terms, rejecting the silver spoon she had been handed from her wealthy and cultivated family background. As with many artists, drawing and making paintings was a crucial part of her life from earliest childhood. As a little girl aged seven, she was dazzled by the beauty of the Greek island Ios, where she lived with her family. She started painting it then and there with her little box of paints, and she would return to the motif later in adult life. Her father, the Oscar-winning writer Frederic Raphael, recognised his daughter's early precocity and always encouraged it. Later, at Bedales, art continued to be central to her life, so much so that, unusually, at 16 she left to study at Camberwell School of Art, instantly recognised as a student of unusual gifts.

Dublin-based Treasury Holdings accused the government of attempting to change the terms of the sale during recent negotiations. Richard Barrett, Treasury's co-owner who will sit on the Legacy board, walked out of a meeting at the end of last week after a row over clauses guaranteeing Whitehall a share of any profits in the first 10 years and a slice of the money made if it is later sold. The Irish backers, who would own 80% of the dome, are believed to feel the government is attempting to tighten the clauses to avoid later charges that it sold the complex too cheaply. Legacy was made the \"preferred bidder\" last November when Japanese bank Nomura dropped out. The Irish deal is due to be signed next month. Treasury Holdings appear to be taking a tougher line than Robert Bourne, the British property developer who is Legacy's frontman and holds a 15% stake. As Treasury played up the problems, a source close to Mr Bourne said: \"There isn't anything that's going to be a deal breaker and we are confident that the deal will go ahead.\" Waiting in the wings if the deal does collapse are Frenchman Pierre-Yves Gerbeau, who would keep it as an entertainment centre, property group Stanhope, and engineering outift Pell Frischmann. These last two would develop the dome as a business complex. Dome minister Lord Falconer's office last night appeared unconcerned by the threatening noises from the Dublin camp. In difficult negotiations of this kind, ministers routinely expect the other side to complain of unfair treatment. But the Tories, who are determined to make the dome a symbol of Labour waste and incompetence at the coming election, seized on media reports that there was to be an investigation of the Greenwich project. Andrew Lansley, the shadow Cabinet Office spokesman, wrote to Sir John Bourn, the comptroller and auditor general who runs the national audit office. In the light of Mr Bourne's admission that, while Legacy was emerging as preferred bidder, he gave Labour \u00a330,000, part of a \u00a3100,000 gift to party funds, Mr Lansley asked Sir John \"to ensure that the scope of your inquiry is concerned not only with the value for money aspects of the [dome] sale, but also the financial propriety of the process for making decisions on the sale which have involved ministers\".",

But the president is the president, and there can be only one of him.</p> <p>It should therefore not be surprising that George W Bush's run-up to his inauguration on Saturday has been executively efficient. Only one minister, the would-be labour secretary, proved dead before arrival. The Republican party network didn't go cold in eight years' absence from the White House. Reaching back to Bush I and Gerald Ford, Bush II could draw on a large cohort of departmental chiefs with a track record in the politico-business complex, and create a cabinet in his own image, which is to say, even in American terms, decidedly rightwing.</p> <p>That's what the system permits, apparently requires. The newly elected president strides undeviating into office. And yet it is extraordinary. It knocks your eyes out. It may be what presidency needs, but its very smoothness is an amnesiac affront to what happened last November. It proceeds as if that election - at best inconclusive, at worst stolen - had nothing unusual about it, nothing that demanded a new kind of response. The transition has passed as if normality prevailed. This is a necessary consequence of the system, but it's one that surely won't stop there: a sleepwalk into pretence, from which Americans will one day wake up. The question is: when?</p> <p>Mr Bush's reliance on tranquillity was always striking. Even before he could know the outcome would be very close, he pledged himself to a new kind of politics. It was an insistent part of his campaign. He promised an end to acrimony and division, a purging of the Washington he ridiculed. When the outcome proved unclear, you might have expected these promises to be redoubled. Instead, he reneged on them at every turn. The tighter the result, it seemed, the less not more consensus had to be sought.</p> <p>First, his new agenda itself pays no regard to compromise. Bush thinks he was elected to do what he said he would do, irrespective of his failure to get a plurality of voters to back him. Thus, for example, he will now withdraw support from any aid organisation that promotes abortions abroad: a strident victory for anti-abortion colonisers. He will go ahead with energy prospecting in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, regardless of opposition. He announces a priority for reversing all Clinton's recent executive actions, especially in the environmental field. None of this has a unifying purpose.</p> <p>Second, his appointment of John Ashcroft as attorney-general is not a gift to the nation but a gesture to the hard right. Ashcroft is not just an anti-liberal but a throwback to days one naively thought had gone for good from respectable federal politics: a racist, a gun-lobby man, anti-choice and anti-gay, as well as a senator prepared, according to the distinguished columnist Anthony Lewis, to lie to block the nomination of a judge he didn't like. A president humbled by the narrowness of his victory would have found an attorney-general who enjoyed bipartisan respect. Instead Bush puts in charge of the justice system a politician whom few people trust, and the Christian right does not want, to administer laws he disagrees with.</p> <p>Third, Bush foreshadows a foreign policy which again moves far from the centre ground. He wants to rethink Russia, challenge China and build a national missile defence system. This may prove to be the policy zone where radical change is hardest to implement. We should wait and see what actually happens about NMD, under the hand of a sceptical secretary of state, Colin Powell. But the chorus demanding it, in Republican circles, deepens. All subtleties are swept aside by a state of mind that could hardly be further from the voice of a divided country. Before any of the technical or diplomatic arguments are heard, let alone concluded, comes the assertive claim to a power that brooks no interference. Hearing the voices of Republicanism triumphant, as I did at a recent American Enterprise Institute seminar, one can easily forget, as they do, that Bush got half a million fewer votes than Gore.</p> <p>Such forceful nonchalance may not seem as startling to Americans as to a European. Maybe America agrees that it must have, above all, a government. Perhaps it doesn't mind much what kind. Maybe it will stand by and watch a rightwing government behaving in a rightwing way. The distance of most voters from Washington makes that easier. The absence of a truly national conversation helps. The closer reality of state governments can make federal anomalies irrelevant in many people's minds. This is a vast country. Besides, George W seems a regular guy, inoffensive, all-American, one of us.</p> <p>Indifference to what's going on could run still deeper. Maybe the country, while evenly split as to voting, is not deeply divided as to the outcome. It is not, after all, an intensely ideological place. Visceral disagreements are confined to social/moral issues, pre-eminently guns and abortion. This is not a time for large statements, especially about the wider world. There being no Soviet menace, perhaps the identity of the national leader is no longer of vast importance. Such, at any rate, must be Bush's hope, as he reflects on the astounding fact that chance and chad have made him president.</p> <p>I don't believe it will be justified. The system may not allow for coalitions, but the divisions of the electorate call for a coalitionist mentality to handle them. However confidently he moves to take the oath of office, Bush must offer something more subtle than the simple assertion of his power. To that extent, his confident behaviour now is a kind of sham. For the divisions are in truth very deep, geographically and racially if not so much in old-fashioned ideology: between cities and the country, between south-and-west and north-centre-and-east, between black (90-9 the respective Gore-Bush percentages) and white, above all between those who think Bush won and those who know he didn't.</p> <p>Where these will cause explosions we cannot tell. But they will come. The serenity in which this surreal presidency begins is deceptive. Every mistake Bush makes will excite the same questions: who exactly is this man, and by what right is he there? The rituals of succession can take him to the White House, but provide no bulwark against the doubts that surround his locus, which he refuses, so far, to do anything to appease. The media, the Congress, many of the people, all conspire to make him seem as real as Ike or Reagan. But this can't last. Unless he finds a way to recognise the uniquely narrow limits of his victory, his presidency will unravel and Dubya will eventually be doomed.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:hugoyoung@compuserve.com\">hugoyoung@compuserve.com</a></p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The completion date of the new Wembley stadium was put back another six months last night as it emerged that an athletics track was unlikely to form part of the development. </p> <p> Sir Rodney Walker, the chairman of Wembley National Stadium Limited, is worried that the target date of autumn 2004 may slip even further and that he cannot guarantee that the stadium would be ready by the summer of 2005 for the world athletics championships. </p> <p> Walker said last night: \"I am leaning towards the proposition that athletics will not be included. The problem is not about design but time. </p> <p> \"There is a huge difference between a target date and the date you actually complete the stadium. It all depends on how quickly I can go to the banks and raise the cash. I want to be in a position where I can put a proposition to the banks as early as possible, raise the finance and then set a firm completion date.\" </p> <p> He added: \"It's impossible to know when the stadium will be ready. If, for some reasons beyond my control, the target date slips further back then it would not be in anybody's interest to commit ourselves to athletics.\" </p> <p> Walker will announce either today or tomorrow whether athletics should be included in the plans. </p> <p> \"We need to get the 2005 process under way as quickly as possible,\" he said. \"We need to be sure about 2005 and about where the event takes place so that it can be organised properly. We can't have this uncertainty hanging over such a high-profile event.\" </p> <p> It is now likely that the championships will be held in a stadium to be built at Picketts Lock in north-east London, where a feasibility study into the site has begun. </p> <p> On Tuesday the culture secretary Chris Smith said it was highly unlikely that Wembley could accommodate athletics and stage the championships. </p> <p> He told a meeting of UK Athletics, local and national government officials, UK Sport, transport authorities and the sports minister Kate Hoey that \u00a31.3m had been set aside for the feasibility study and preparation should begin on constructing a stadium for the championships. </p> <p> The Picketts Lock project is expected to cost \u00a395m. Sport England has already pledged \u00a360m of lottery money and the remainder will be raised through private investment and regeneration budgets. </p> <p> In the absence of finalised plans and costs, Walker has not yet been able to approach City institutions to raise finance for Wembley. He is worried that this could take time, given the failure last year to raise \u00a3410m. Investor confidence in the project was low during the tenure of Chelsea's chairman Ken Bates, who was replaced by Walker as chair of WNSL last month. Bates's plans for a hotel and banqueting facilities were also shelved. </p> <p> Architects agree that a track could be included within the new Wembley but say more land might be required. It was initially thought that the inclusion of athletics would benefit the project financially. Around \u00a340m of lottery money has been pledged for the staging of the world championships and WNSL would not have to return \u00a320m of lottery money, which it promised to do last year when athletics was first ruled out. </p> <p> However, Walker said last night that, after careful examination, the inclusion of athletics would have been financially neutral because any extra money would have gone towards staging the 2005 championships and building a warm-up track. As it stands WNSL will now have to return the \u00a320m to Sport England; money that has already been spent on buying the site. </p> <p> Walker added: \"I feel sure that with more time a solution could have been found which would have allowed us to include athletics and stage the 2005 championships. However, we have not even started the funding process and we can't take any risks with 2005. We don't know how long it will take to raise the finance.\" </p> <p> Walker added that he was examining other ways to cut the original \u00a3660m cost of the project. He will report on his proposals for the new stadium at the end of the month.</p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "bodyText": "The completion date of the new Wembley stadium was put back another six months last night as it emerged that an athletics track was unlikely to form part of the development. Sir Rodney Walker, the chairman of Wembley National Stadium Limited, is worried that the target date of autumn 2004 may slip even further and that he cannot guarantee that the stadium would be ready by the summer of 2005 for the world athletics championships. Walker said last night: \"I am leaning towards the proposition that athletics will not be included. The problem is not about design but time. \"There is a huge difference between a target date and the date you actually complete the stadium. It all depends on how quickly I can go to the banks and raise the cash. I want to be in a position where I can put a proposition to the banks as early as possible, raise the finance and then set a firm completion date.\" He added: \"It's impossible to know when the stadium will be ready. If, for some reasons beyond my control, the target date slips further back then it would not be in anybody's interest to commit ourselves to athletics.\" Walker will announce either today or tomorrow whether athletics should be included in the plans. \"We need to get the 2005 process under way as quickly as possible,\" he said. \"We need to be sure about 2005 and about where the event takes place so that it can be organised properly. We can't have this uncertainty hanging over such a high-profile event.\" It is now likely that the championships will be held in a stadium to be built at Picketts Lock in north-east London, where a feasibility study into the site has begun. On Tuesday the culture secretary Chris Smith said it was highly unlikely that Wembley could accommodate athletics and stage the championships. He told a meeting of UK Athletics, local and national government officials, UK Sport, transport authorities and the sports minister Kate Hoey that \u00a31.3m had been set aside for the feasibility study and preparation should begin on constructing a stadium for the championships. The Picketts Lock project is expected to cost \u00a395m. Sport England has already pledged \u00a360m of lottery money and the remainder will be raised through private investment and regeneration budgets. In the absence of finalised plans and costs, Walker has not yet been able to approach City institutions to raise finance for Wembley. He is worried that this could take time, given the failure last year to raise \u00a3410m. Investor confidence in the project was low during the tenure of Chelsea's chairman Ken Bates, who was replaced by Walker as chair of WNSL last month. Bates's plans for a hotel and banqueting facilities were also shelved. Architects agree that a track could be included within the new Wembley but say more land might be required. It was initially thought that the inclusion of athletics would benefit the project financially. Around \u00a340m of lottery money has been pledged for the staging of the world championships and WNSL would not have to return \u00a320m of lottery money, which it promised to do last year when athletics was first ruled out. However, Walker said last night that, after careful examination, the inclusion of athletics would have been financially neutral because any extra money would have gone towards staging the 2005 championships and building a warm-up track. As it stands WNSL will now have to return the \u00a320m to Sport England; money that has already been spent on buying the site. Walker added: \"I feel sure that with more time a solution could have been found which would have allowed us to include athletics and stage the 2005 championships. However, we have not even started the funding process and we can't take any risks with 2005. We don't know how long it will take to raise the finance.\" Walker added that he was examining other ways to cut the original \u00a3660m cost of the project. He will report on his proposals for the new stadium at the end of the month. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

Many substances release more energy than high explosives when they burn. A thermobaric bomb could be five to 10 times as powerful as a standard one of the same weight, even before the added effects of a fuel-air blast are taken into account. </p> <p>Developing a fuel-air weapon involves major technical challenges. Ideally, a warhead would release a perfectly uniform cloud of gas which would mix perfectly with the air before being ignited. But the unpredictable effects of the wind, terrain and climate meant that the early fuel-air bombs were more useful for engineering tasks than as weapons. The most famous was the fearsome BLU-82 \"Big Blue 82\". At more than seven tonnes, it is too large for a bomber or attack aircraft, and has to be rolled out of the back of a modified Hercules transport. In Vietnam it was used to create instant helicopter landing pads out of the thickest jungle. </p> <p>Another use was mine clearance. The pressure wave from a BLU-82 can detonate mines over a wide area. One was tested against the minefields in Iraq in 1991 with limited success, though the blast was awesome. The hot air rose rapidly, taking a column of smoke and dust with it, until it reached a layer of cooler air in the atmosphere and flattened out to make a mushroom cloud. The partial vacuum at ground level sucked in more air - hence the name 'vacuum bomb' sometimes given to these weapons. </p> <p>An SAS patrol is reported to have mistaken the cloud for a nuclear attack, and nearby Iraqis probably thought the same.

The high temperature and rising cloud would have dispersed the chemical agent completely, while the blast destroyed any signs on the ground. </p> <p> A lthough the blast from a thermobaric weapon is very powerful, blast is not a very effective way of killing people. Some 200 years ago, Henry Shrapnel, an English artillery officer, invented a shell that scattered musket balls when it burst. This made it far more lethal than those which relied on gunpowder alone. The same principle has been used ever since, leading to fragmentation grenades and the horribly effective nail-bomb. The stun grenade, on the other hand, is designed with a cardboard casing so as not to throw out any dangerous fragments and cause concussion only. Shrapnel is indiscriminate; a grenade is lethal to a range of three metres or so, but there is still a risk of injury 60 metres away. Fuel-air weapons which produce little shrapnel are less likely to cause \"collateral damage\" in this way. </p> <p>The ultimate development of the fragmentation weapon is the cluster bomb. A hundred small bombs give more deadly coverage than one big one, creating an intermeshing pattern of deadly metal shards over a wide area. The problem is that fuses are not entirely reliable, leaving several unexploded but dangerous bomblets scattered about every time one is used. If a fuel-air bomb does not detonate, the explosive cloud blows away and disperses on the wind. </p> <p>The weapon that the Ministry of Defence is developing would be carried and fired by a single soldier. It is intended for use in an urban environment, where soldiers are often faced with snipers holed up in buildings. The only choices are to storm the building or use enough explosives to virtually demolish it. A thermobaric weapon may be able to break through a brick wall. It may not need to: the cloud from a fuel-air weapon will permeate open windows and doors, and the blast inside a closed space is greatly magnified. The only real defence is a hermetically sealed bunker. </p> <p>The injuries caused by blast are as unpleasant as anything on the battlefield. Most damage is caused when the shockwave passes from tissue to fluid or air, resulting in collapsed lungs and multiple internal haemorrhages. Anyone inside the cloud when it is detonated will probably be killed instantly. </p> <p>The drive to gain hard currency means that many of these weapons are already on the open market. These include the 11kg disposable Shmel rocket, and a new fuel-air warhead for the venerable RPG rocket launcher favoured by guerrillas around the world.

      "body": "<p>If there is one thing keeping internet executives from throwing themselves off the window ledge at the moment it is the beckoning of a new Golden Age. They are praying they will be among the survivors of the current bloodletting and able to take advantage of the reduced competition that will ensue to do what they always wanted to do but could not: charge for the services they offer. </p> <p>There is a growing feeling among producers - not yet shared, it has to be said, by consumers - that the web's digital free lunch has got to end. Businesses are not the International Red Cross. They exist to make a profit. Never in history have commercial companies been set up to provide free services for the general public. </p> <p>The only exceptions have been products such as television programmes or free newspapers where advertising revenues have amply compensated for the lack of point-of-sale income. The lesson of the last year is that the banner advertising model for internet companies has failed to produce a formula for survival. There are alternatives - like being required to watch a streaming video advertisement (like those on commercial TV) before you access sites, but they are a year or two away and may meet consumer resistance, at least for the pioneers. Meanwhile, web companies must get income or pack it all in. </p> <p>It is worth pondering how long this unusual culture can continue. We not only expect our email and web access to be free but we are quite prepared to ring up the host company and complain bitterly when it isn't being delivered reliably - even threatening to take our custom elsewhere. The cheek of it! </p> <p>Yet how much would you be prepared to pay for email if it were not free? At 5p a throw it would be a bargain against a first class letter at 27p and the latter cannot be delivered anywhere in the world instantaneously complete with colour, or even moving, pictures. </p> <p>What would you be prepared to pay for a search engine such as Google, a web browser like Netscape or Explorer or the facility to build your own website with 100MB of free web space (as FortuneCity offers)? </p> <p>You would never expect oil companies to sell their product for nothing, what is so different about web companies? The answer is: a lot. First, and most important, the marginal cost of production of a web product is zero. You may spend millions building a product like a search engine or email facility but thereafter you can \"produce\" millions more at no extra cost (the consumer pays the very modest delivery charge when they download). </p> <p>If Microsoft started charging for email, there would be a mass migration to Yahoo!. And if all the main email providers decided simultaneously to charge, then a free alternative would soon emerge from the mutuality of the web. Remember, Mosaic, the browser that changed the world when it mutated into Netscape started life as a free-to-all product developed in academia. Likewise Napster. </p> <p>To escape from the - truly wonderful - mutuality of the web, companies must do one of three things. First provide such irresistible value added that people are prepared to pay for it. </p> <p>The trouble is that value added - as Yahoo and MSN know to their cost, is also replicable: Yahoo! soon becomes Metoo. The newly fashionable variant of this, I am informed, is a big move by telcos, cable companies and carriers into \"aggregated content packages\". Consumers will be offered content as part of a package bundled into their telecom or cable charges so they do not realise what they are actually paying for. </p> <p>Second, companies will try to exploit a monopoly or quasi-monopoly situation in order to charge. Microsoft's 95% armlock on operating systems enables it to charge for its spreadsheets and word processing packages while AOL's walled garden of services enables it to charge its members. Why is it that email is free but text messages (ludicrously, when you consider how little system capacity they use up) cost 10p a throw? It's because the telcos control the portals. </p> <p>Third, companies will try to fill in the missing link of web commerce - the absence of a micro-payments system for charging for small activities. If this had happened at the beginning of the web explosion then punters may have been prepared to pay, say, 1p or 5p for accessing premium pages (BT's pioneering Prestel service succeeded on a modest scale) and we would not have become immunised against paying for web activity. </p> <p>If this had happened it would have inverted the paradigm of web commerce and could have led to an unprecedented empowerment of individuals. Instead of the telcos creaming off all the money from web traffic (which would not exist without web sites to go to) part of the revenue would have gone to the people who created the web sites - maybe you. </p> <p>The next few years will see a breakthrough in web payment schemes. Which one will win - paying by email, prepayment cards, secure credit cards or on your utility bills - I do not know. I suspect that it will lead to a new breed of quasi-mutual companies which combine making enough small profits to keep going without attracting interest from institutional or stock market investors. Will Yahoo! be the first?</p>",

      "bodyText": "If there is one thing keeping internet executives from throwing themselves off the window ledge at the moment it is the beckoning of a new Golden Age. They are praying they will be among the survivors of the current bloodletting and able to take advantage of the reduced competition that will ensue to do what they always wanted to do but could not: charge for the services they offer. There is a growing feeling among producers - not yet shared, it has to be said, by consumers - that the web's digital free lunch has got to end. Businesses are not the International Red Cross. They exist to make a profit. Never in history have commercial companies been set up to provide free services for the general public. The only exceptions have been products such as television programmes or free newspapers where advertising revenues have amply compensated for the lack of point-of-sale income. The lesson of the last year is that the banner advertising model for internet companies has failed to produce a formula for survival. There are alternatives - like being required to watch a streaming video advertisement (like those on commercial TV) before you access sites, but they are a year or two away and may meet consumer resistance, at least for the pioneers. Meanwhile, web companies must get income or pack it all in. It is worth pondering how long this unusual culture can continue. We not only expect our email and web access to be free but we are quite prepared to ring up the host company and complain bitterly when it isn't being delivered reliably - even threatening to take our custom elsewhere. The cheek of it! Yet how much would you be prepared to pay for email if it were not free? At 5p a throw it would be a bargain against a first class letter at 27p and the latter cannot be delivered anywhere in the world instantaneously complete with colour, or even moving, pictures. What would you be prepared to pay for a search engine such as Google, a web browser like Netscape or Explorer or the facility to build your own website with 100MB of free web space (as FortuneCity offers)? You would never expect oil companies to sell their product for nothing, what is so different about web companies? The answer is: a lot. First, and most important, the marginal cost of production of a web product is zero. You may spend millions building a product like a search engine or email facility but thereafter you can \"produce\" millions more at no extra cost (the consumer pays the very modest delivery charge when they download). If Microsoft started charging for email, there would be a mass migration to Yahoo!. And if all the main email providers decided simultaneously to charge, then a free alternative would soon emerge from the mutuality of the web. Remember, Mosaic, the browser that changed the world when it mutated into Netscape started life as a free-to-all product developed in academia. Likewise Napster. To escape from the - truly wonderful - mutuality of the web, companies must do one of three things. First provide such irresistible value added that people are prepared to pay for it. The trouble is that value added - as Yahoo and MSN know to their cost, is also replicable: Yahoo! soon becomes Metoo. The newly fashionable variant of this, I am informed, is a big move by telcos, cable companies and carriers into \"aggregated content packages\". Consumers will be offered content as part of a package bundled into their telecom or cable charges so they do not realise what they are actually paying for. Second, companies will try to exploit a monopoly or quasi-monopoly situation in order to charge. Microsoft's 95% armlock on operating systems enables it to charge for its spreadsheets and word processing packages while AOL's walled garden of services enables it to charge its members. Why is it that email is free but text messages (ludicrously, when you consider how little system capacity they use up) cost 10p a throw? It's because the telcos control the portals. Third, companies will try to fill in the missing link of web commerce - the absence of a micro-payments system for charging for small activities. If this had happened at the beginning of the web explosion then punters may have been prepared to pay, say, 1p or 5p for accessing premium pages (BT's pioneering Prestel service succeeded on a modest scale) and we would not have become immunised against paying for web activity. If this had happened it would have inverted the paradigm of web commerce and could have led to an unprecedented empowerment of individuals. Instead of the telcos creaming off all the money from web traffic (which would not exist without web sites to go to) part of the revenue would have gone to the people who created the web sites - maybe you. The next few years will see a breakthrough in web payment schemes. Which one will win - paying by email, prepayment cards, secure credit cards or on your utility bills - I do not know. I suspect that it will lead to a new breed of quasi-mutual companies which combine making enough small profits to keep going without attracting interest from institutional or stock market investors. Will Yahoo! be the first?",

The number of females making secure connections at retail sites increased almost fourfold on 1999. </p> <p>Six of the top 10 most visited secure websites were financial, an indication that internet users are becoming less worried about carrying out financial transactions online. In fact, research from Nilesen//NetRatings indicates that the UK is one of the most developed e-banking markets in Europe. </p> <p>As the old-economy companies adapt to the internet, so the net is becoming more acceptable to the general populace. </p> <p>According to research company the Henley Centre, Britain's online numbers have grown from 30% of the adult population (46.5m) in 1999 to 39% in 2000. Even more dramatically, the number of users going online at home has more than doubled in just a year from 12% to 28% of the total adult UK population. </p> <p>In this category, the proportion of women users is growing rapidly, a finding that chimes with data gleaned from the Christmas period. The Henley Centre found that women account for 44% of home users, a 4% increase from 1999. </p> <p>\"Women now have more confidence,\" said Andrew Curry, associate director for new media at the Henley Centre. \"Before it was a case of 'my husband will kill me if I use his computer.'\" </p> <p>Curry says women also tend to go online more purposively, with a definite task in mind, unlike men, who have a tendency to spend hours surfing haphazardly. </p> <p>In that sense men's and women's online behaviour is very similar to their TV watching patterns. With more women coming online, the Henley Centre reckons that Britain is probably about 18 months away from the landmark reached by the US in the middle of last year, when the number of women online overtook the number of men. The current ratio of men to women online in the UK is 55 to 45. </p> <p>Another feature of online use from home is that the social composition is becoming more like the population as a whole, albeit slowly. In particular, the proportion of less well-off people going online has risen sharply. The at home group of 13.1m people is also getting older with people aged 35 to 64 have made ground while the proportion aged 15-34 has declined. The Henley Centre argues that this augurs well for e-commerce, as the older users have more money to spend than their younger counterparts. </p> <p>But the biggest category for online purposes is what the Henley Centre calls the nearly group. These are people who have the strong potential to get online and are reasonably confident with other technological gadgets, in particular personal computers and game consoles. But people in this group - 14.8m - are not yet users. </p> <p>This large group notwithstanding, the trend is clear, argues Curry: internet use, a minority activity only two years ago, is becoming increasingly mainstream and with each year, the picture of the UK online population starts to look more and more like the population at large. </p> <p><strong> Total number of adults in each segment: June 2000</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Total UK adult population</strong> 46.5 million </p> <p><strong> @home </strong> 13.1 million </p> <p><strong> ne@rly</strong> 14.8 million </p> <p><strong> m@ybe</strong> 4.6 million </p> <p><strong> not@ll</strong> 8.8 million </p> <p> Source: Planning for Consumer Change 11/2000</p>",

Almost half of all school leavers will soon go to university.

Analysts predict that the e-university industry will be worth $2bn in two years. This is leading to a number of higher education institutions to forge alliances with the private sector. For example, the London School of Economics, together with Chicago, Columbia and Stanford universities, is now offering degree modules online via, UNext, a private internet-based company. And with other academic institutions grappling with their own funding crises other companies are realising that there is money to be made in wiring Britain's universities. </p> <p>Up until now e-learning has been mostly a US phenomenon. But just before Christmas a UK start-up, founded by three former Oxford University students, launched its first ever e-lecture. Why the World Wars were Won is a 40 minute lecture by Oxford professor Niall Ferguson. The e-lecture comprises of an audio-video stream of Ferguson's head, interspersed occasional archive film footage and accompanied by a rolling transcript with additional footnotes and links. The lecture has been archived and can be watched anytime. </p> <p>Professor Niall Ferguson, professor of Political and Financial History at the University of Oxford is head of <a href=\"http://www.boxmind.com\" target=\"_new\">Boxmind's</a> editorial board and is a director of the company. Boxmind's chief executive officer is Richard Halkett, who gained a double first in history from Merton College, Oxford. Halkett, along with two college mates, Richard Comish and David Auckland, hatched the idea for Boxmind while the trio were studying for finals - a mere three years ago. </p> <p>With Ferguson's help Boxmind has recruited a team of internationally renowned dons to its editorial board. They include Richard Dawkins, Peter Atkins, John Kay and Dr David Womersley. Boxmind is based in Oxford, but has no formal links with the university. </p> <p>Over the summer Boxmind hired 30 people, mostly students, to help build an online library - a kind of academic Yahoo! The students filtered 150,000 academic websites down to 17,000 and referenced them across 27 core subject areas. </p> <p>Boxmind has no intention of becoming an online university. It is more of an e-publisher that buys up the rights to specific lectures and is now trying to license them out to the universities. </p> <p>\"There maybe some start-ups out there who will decide to set up a net university,\" admits Halkett. \"But when people want a degree they want one from Warwick, LSE, Oxford, Cambridge or Stamford. People still want those affiliations.\" So academic content providers like Boxmind are attempting to step in to provide online resources for the UK's cash-strapped universities. </p> <p>But although most academics agree that online resources are becoming an essential component of most undergraduate degrees, not all see the e-lecture as the only way forward. </p> <p>\"I don't think that the lecture is a method that should persist,\" argues Diana Laurillard, pro-vice chancellor of learning technologies and teaching at the Open University. \"It is wonderful for occasional moments when you have an inspirational speaker. But it is not suitable for the way in which you deliver the bulk of the learning. You have to have something that is much more interactive.\" </p> <p>What the OU does have is something called Lyceum - a kind of virtual classroom where groups of two or three students complete exercises. Lyceum uses audio software that means that the students can literally talk to each other. They share a number of visual aids and a lecturer moves between various \"rooms\" monitoring progress and setting fresh exercises. </p> <p>Britain's oldest distance learning institution began experimenting with webcasting as long ago as 1995 and recently announced a \u00a312m investment over three years aimed at \"extending and enhancing\" the OU's position as an e-university. The OU learning community now has 200,000 students online and numbers are growing rapidly. </p> <p>The OU say that it will never be a totally online but by 2004 all courses will have some online component. Already 85% of OU students have access to computers. Laurillard admits that there will always be \"some small group that will not have net access.\" But the OU is pursuing a regional programme that is putting students in touch with \"the plethora of community centres, libraries and schools that give net access.\" </p> <p>But it is not just specialist universities that are going online. Traditional universities are beginning to offer online courses too. The University of Greenwich will offer its first online post-graduate courses in September. An MSc in e-commerce has been developed jointly by the university's schools of business and of computing, maths and statistics. Other online resources will be integrated to many of its undergraduate courses as well. </p> <p>John Dunne, a lecturer in French history, agrees that online resources give a university like Greenwich the chance to compete with the best universities in the country - not least through knowledge of the internet. \"With lecturers developing their web awareness we can have access to materials that otherwise we couldn't afford,\" he admits. </p> <p> But, interestingly enough, Dunne argues that online resources have other benefits too. The use of the internet helps \"narrow the gap between traditional undergraduate learning and research because more and more students can visit the internet and get access to the kind of sources that they used to get from books. Now books - the secondary sources - are no longer their staple.\" </p> <p>No one is quite suggesting that the internet will lead to a more egalitarian university system in the UK. Not yet, perhaps never. If companies like Boxmind and UNext manage to secure some of the most prominent academics in the country, how long will the universities - who pay their wages - allow their dons to moonlight? What would be the point of going to Oxford, it could be argued, if you can study the same curriculum taught by the same lecturer at a local university like Greenwich, Paisley or Huddersfield? </p> <p>Indeed, this very problem is currently being thrashed out in the US courts. Arthur Miller, a Harvard law professor, has been freelancing with Concorde - the US's first ever online law school. Harvard says that Miller has no right to advertise himself on Concorde as a Harvard professor. So Miller is taking it to court over the right to use his title. </p> <p>But battles over copyright aside, should we be so keen to embrace the flexibility of online learning? Many in the e-learning fraternity are quick to point out how the internet will benefit many special groups like the disabled and single or working parents. In the US, over half of online students are over 30; most already have a degree and work full time. This, say the online universities, is the key to success - allowing people to study whenever and wherever they want. </p> <p>But some say that it could also let universities off the hook. Many disabled groups want better wheelchair access, not internet access, and single parents seeking the social aspect of university would probably opt for a campus creche over a series of e-lectures, no matter how well referenced and easy to use they are. </p> <p>Still, it is also worth remembering that only in the UK do the majority of students relocate vast distances to study. Ultimately, if students have the same access to the same resources then perhaps online learning could lead to the development of a fairer university system that would put a local university on the same footing as the academic big hitters.

They want to find the monetary worth, each year, of Britain's elderflower blooms, chestnut coppices, wild samphire, whortleberries and other wild plants. </p> <p>Scientists at the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew long ago established that a hectare of flourishing Amazon rainforest could be more valuable in cash terms as a sustainable harvest for the local community than as a stand of timber to be cleared once. </p> <p>\"But it's never been done here, right under our noses,\" says Hew Prendergast, who leads research at the economic botany centre at Kew. Five years ago, he supervised a master's thesis on the value of the market for elderflower cordial, spritzer and presse. Elder is a rampant tree that most gardeners curse. </p> <p>\"Most of it was still coming from the wild. The companies that made these drinks were sending out hundreds of pick ers at the right time of year, picking elder, and we concluded that the retail value of these elder products was at least \u00a310m a year.\" </p> <p>The researchers then looked at other plants that make money for small industries. Burdock and dandelion go into popular soft drinks. Are they harvested wild? Or are they imported? Who is it that gathers the fleshy perennial samphire from the sea shore and serves it up as an expensive foodie item in the London markets? Who braves the thorns to pick the sloes that go into sloe gin? </p> <p>\"What about the whortleberries of upland Britain?\" Dr Prendergast asks. \"How many people are earning a living from collecting whortleberries and turning them into jam and so forth? Whortleberries are a central part of the landscape: lose the whortleberries and you have lost an important component.\" </p> <p>His point is that there is an intimate connection between economics and conservation: make the wild landscape something of value and people will conserve it. Conserve it, and it will have extra value for the nation. The British make and drink birch wine, but what about birch brooms? These are harvested from the north Hampshire heathlands and used at Kew. </p> <p>\"When they are long, they are good for light sweeping. As they are worn down, they are very good for heavier things like wet leaves and snow,\" he says. \"Why aren't these birch brooms in places like B&amp;Q?\" </p> <p>The reedbeds of Norfolk are an example of wild economics, he argues. They shelter wildlife and add to natural beauty, and the RSPB recently calculated that the natural history and beauty of the north Norfolk coast was worth 3,000 jobs and an income of \u00a3120m a year to the local economy. But reeds had other direct value. The value of a thatched house is, he says, going through the roof. Britain has about 50,000 thatched homes, which keep between 600 and 1,000 professional thatchers busy every year. But over the years, most of the reed has been imported from eastern Europe. </p> <p>\"Wouldn't it be nice if all these thatchers were earning a living from our native reedbeds, which were managed in a sustainable way which was good for wildlife?\" </p> <p>Reedbeds have another direct economic use: they can be used to turn sewage into clean water. \"That is a wild plant for direct economic use. If you didn't have reeds, would you need some purification plant that was going to cost the earth? So the wild plant and its habitat has a replacement value. If you are not going to use the plant, the alternative is going to be some complex chemistry which will cost_ whatever. It's a very interesting concept. If you don't have marram grass to stabilise sand dunes, how the heck are you going to do it?\" </p> <p>A team of US economists and biologists asked themselves such questions and proposed, in Nature in May 1997, that plants, insects and microbes provided humans with services - pollination, water purification, nutrient recycling and so on - worth \u00a321 trillion a year. That is, wild things were very big business. But Dr Prendergast is content, for the moment, to put an economic value on the kind of small business that never gets counted in the Gross National Product. </p> <p>The invasive weed, bracken, has suddenly acquired value again: in a recent hot summer, when crop yields were low and straw prices soared, farmers in Wales went back to an old tradition and began harvesting bracken and drying it to for use as bedding for animals over winter. In Ashdown Forest, Sussex, commoners had - and still have - the right to take bracken, heather, grass and rushes as bedding for animals. It does not happen much these days, and so bracken has to be grubbed up. The forest authorities want to mix cleared bracken with animal manure and turn it into compost - except in the New Forest, where they want to conserve it because it shelters Britain's only wild gladiolus. </p> <p>Who knows? There could be other economic uses. Take the flowering stem of the bulrush, or greater reed mace, used for cleansing effluent. \"I threw the whole lot on the bonfire once and the bloom ing things wouldn't burn. These things will not burn. If we wanted a fire retardant material, we could stick these in.\" </p> <p>The Kew scientists hope to find out more about the economics of harvesting Sussex wealden wildflower seed to recreate old hay meadows. They want to make an inventory of the charcoal burning business. They want to hear more about the pickers of wild mushrooms for the upmarket restaurant industry. They want to count the hazel hurdle makers and the gatherers of Kentish cobnuts and the people who gather willow withies for log baskets and garden trugs. They want to find out who gathers seaweed for Irish and Welsh delicacies, for cattle feed and for compost. </p> <p>\"How many people are involved? How much more can be done? How can we help raise the profile of all these things?\" Dr Prendergast asks. \"One can come up with all these ideas, but one hopes all sorts of other things will come out of the woodwork.\"</p>",

They want to count the hazel hurdle makers and the gatherers of Kentish cobnuts and the people who gather willow withies for log baskets and garden trugs. They want to find out who gathers seaweed for Irish and Welsh delicacies, for cattle feed and for compost. \"How many people are involved? How much more can be done? How can we help raise the profile of all these things?\" Dr Prendergast asks. \"One can come up with all these ideas, but one hopes all sorts of other things will come out of the woodwork.\"",

Demonstrating a prototype Xbox in London last week, J Allard, general manager of Xbox development in Seattle, said true, movie-style lighting is what had been missing from video games. Add lighting and realistic shadows and you get 3D games that look more like Toy Story 2, and generate more emotion. </p> <p>\"One of our objectives is to shift from a programming model to an art-driven model\" for games, Allard said. Game designers should be able to implement what they imagined, instead of working around hardware limitations. </p> <p>The power of the new machine was evident from Malice, a bug-crushing game developed by Jez San's Argonaut Software in London. Microsoft chairman Bill Gates used the game to demonstrate the prototype Xbox at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas earlier this month. Malice looks better than anything on the Sony PlayStation 2, or today's typical PC game, but it is still only a demo. </p> <p>The Xbox hardware is now complete except for the new Nvidia NV2A graphics chips which will be plugged in at the last minute. However, the Nvidia processor will only run at 250MHz instead of the promised 300MHz, compared with the PS2's 150MHz equivalent. Allard claimed the Xbox would still deliver a threefold improvement over the PS2 because the main processor speed had been increased from 600MHz to 733MHz. \"We've rebalanced the system,\" he added. </p> <p>The prototype also showed that the Xbox would not ship with standard USB (Universal Serial Bus) ports, as fitted to most of today's personal computers. Allard said this was to prevent consumers from plugging things in and finding that they do not do anything, which happened with the PS2. The different socket will ensure that only Xbox peripherals can be used. </p> <p>Also, according to Allard, \"We've put more voltage in the wire\" to provide more force feedback (vibration) in the controller. </p> <p>Another change from the specification announced last year is that the standard Xbox will not play movies on DVD, although it will play DVD scenes from game discs. To play DVD movies, consumers will have to buy an accessory remote controller for $20-$30. Allard claimed consumers prefered to use a video controller for movies, rather than a game controller, and that it meant hard-core gamers would not have to pay for DVD playback facilities they did not want. </p> <p>Further, there are no plans to launch a keyboard and mouse. Allard stressed that the Xbox had been \"designed by gamers for gamers\" and was not intended to be a general purpose device. </p> <p>\"The general purpose computer is the PC,\" he said. \"We decided we did not want to be the minivan of computer games, we wanted to be the Ferrari.\" </p> <p>Allard also confirmed that the Xbox will provide \"region coding\" for games. This will enable publishers to code games so that they can only be played on one or two of the three versions of the Xbox built for North America, Europe and Japan. Gamers do not like regionalisation, and Microsoft intends to discourage it, but \"we put the power in the publishers' hands to make these decisions\". </p> <p>Xbox consoles will be built by Flextronics, which is based in Singapore, in factories in Mexico, Hungary, and one location in Asia. </p> <p>Although Microsoft did not make any announcements about the Xbox's size and weight, the device is bigger and heavier than might have been expected: it is larger than many of the PCs with which it shares parts. \"That's due to the power supply and the bad-ass graphics chip we've got in there,\" Allard explained. </p> <p>Both the size and weight are missing from the comparison specifications of the Xbox, PS2 and Sony Gamecube posted on the official site at <a href=\"http://www.xbox.com/xbox/flash/specs.asp\">www.xbox.com/xbox/flash/specs.asp</a>. </p> <p> One detail that remains undecided is the price. Traditionally, games consoles are sold at close to cost price, with the difference being covered by royalties on the sales of very profitable games. However, it is hard to envisage a system with a 733MHz Intel Pentium 3, Nvidia graphics processor, 64MB of memory, an 8GB hard drive and 100Mbit/sec Ethernet networking going for less than \u00a3299. </p> <p>By the time the Xbox arrives in the UK - perhaps March next year - the Sony PS2 may well be cheaper than that and have a better selection of games.

Scribble a diagram, or a complicated mathematical equation, and make a few freehand notes: anything written on the 40-sheet A4 notepad with the TransNote's special pen is automatically transferred to the computer's flat panel display, and stored on the PCs hard drive for later use. You get, says IBM, the best of both worlds. </p> <p>The TransNote does have a keyboard but it is aimed at people who prefer to make handwritten notes, including lawyers, bankers, and many journalists. It could also appeal to people whose notes are not easily typed, such as science and engineering students.

      "bodyText": "IBM is combining a paper notebook with a notebook PC in its TransNote computer, which will be launched next month. Scribble a diagram, or a complicated mathematical equation, and make a few freehand notes: anything written on the 40-sheet A4 notepad with the TransNote's special pen is automatically transferred to the computer's flat panel display, and stored on the PCs hard drive for later use. You get, says IBM, the best of both worlds. The TransNote does have a keyboard but it is aimed at people who prefer to make handwritten notes, including lawyers, bankers, and many journalists. It could also appeal to people whose notes are not easily typed, such as science and engineering students. The user's jottings, stored by IBM's Ink Manager software, can also be converted to standard JPEG (.jpg) files and sent by email. Another advantage is that notebooks stored on the PC remain readily available long after the paper versions have been used up and either filed or thrown away.

By looking around the screen, it is usually possible to discover what you need to do, without having to learn obscure commands and key combinations. However, this is a very slow and inefficient way of doing things that you need to do often, and over-use of computer mice can also lead to physical pains in the forearm. It can help to learn the keystroke commands for these regular actions. This is easy to do, and soon you won't even have to think about them. </p> <p>For example, I regularly grab texts from news wires, copy them into Microsoft Word, and save them. The sequence is: Ctrl-A (selects everything), Ctrl-C (copies what has been selected), Alt-Tab (switches to Word), Ctrl-N (creates a new blank document), Ctrl-V (inserts copy) and Ctrl-S (for save). Once you've done it a few times, it takes only a few seconds. </p> <p>I'm not starting a war against mice. One really useful thing about this string of key combinations is it can be performed with the left hand, so I can keep my right hand on the mouse. </p> <p>All these keystrokes are worth learning, whichever applications you use. If you are browsing the web, for example, there is no quicker or easier way to open a new browser window than Ctrl-N. The mousy alternative is to move the cursor to the File menu, select New, then move across to Window. Even doing it with keystrokes is fussy (Alt-F, right arrow, Enter). However, if you do that, you will notice that Microsoft has included the Ctrl-N tip on the pull-down menu. </p> <p>There are four key combinations you should master first, and fortunately they are easy to remember. Use Ctrl-C to copy things (C stands for copy) and Ctrl-X to cut them (the X is like a pair of scissors). Use Ctrl-V to insert what you've copied (the V is an insert sign, upside down), and Ctrl-S to save it (S stands for save). </p> <p>The same keystrokes may work on other systems, too, though on the Apple Macintosh, you have to press the Command key instead of the Control key. Other useful keyboard shortcuts are provided on the Mac's drop-down menus. The Mac does not have as many shortcuts as Windows, but they are much more consistent across applications: this means they are easier to learn and even more useful. </p> <p>Another interface convention is to underline a letter to indicate a keyboard shortcut. For example, in Windows, the File menu always has the F underlined. This means that pressing Alt-F will select the file menu, then pressing O on its own will select Open (the O is underlined). A few of these shortcuts are worth knowing, especially if you use Notepad a lot: Alt-F S Alt-F X saves a file and exits, for example. The drawback is that Format has the o underlined because the F has already been used for the File command. It is probably not worth trying to learn that, unless you use it several times a day. </p> <p>Learning underlines can also be dangerous, because the same keystroke shortcut may do different things in different applications. </p> <p>Some of the PCs dozen function keys, labelled F1 to F12, are also useful. In Windows Explorer, for example, highlighting a filename and pressing F2 lets you rename it, while pressing F3 brings up a search box. If you high light a folder in the left-hand pane, pressing F5 makes Windows re-read the directory and update the list of files. </p> <p>Files can also be copied using Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V, just like bits of text. </p> <p>And on both the PC and the Mac, pressing the first letter of the file you want will take you to the first file that begins with that letter. If there are a lot of files in a directory, this is usually quicker than scrolling to it. </p> <p>People who suffer from disabilities or strain injuries may want to use keystrokes even for things that most people are happy to do with a mouse. And, indeed, a surprising amount can be done. In Windows, for example, the Alt-spacebar combination provides access to control menus, so you can minimise a program (make it disappear from the desktop) by pressing Alt-spacebar then N. Not many people know that. </p> <p>Pressing Alt-spacebar then M (for Move) lets you move a window to a new position on the screen. Move the window using the cursor keys and press Enter to accept the new position. Pressing Alt-spacebar then S lets you use the cursor keys to make a window bigger or smaller. Microsoft's aim for certified Windows 2000 programs is that users should be able to perform \"every\" action from the keyboard, without using a mouse at all. </p>",

Many smaller enemies can be disposed of by the simple but satisfying technique of stomping on them. </p> <p>The problem is that you have to control your mech while moving, aiming and firing, which is like driving a tank and aiming the gun at the same time. It is not a good idea to stand still, as your enemies may include pilots with even bigger and nastier mechs than yours. Oh, you are also leading a squadron of mechs, which is something else to think about. </p> <p>What helps make Mech 4 accessible is the carefully graded series of missions you must perform. It is restricting compared with the old days when you could roam the universe picking fights, but it works. The action is also backed by a heroic backstory, which Frank Herbert could have used as a sequel to Dune. (Your family has been murdered.

A psychedelic take on the 3D first-person shooter, Alice pits you against all manner of unlikely foes, and throws in a few traps and puzzles to boot. </p> <p>Making full use of the Quake 3 engine, Alice looks a treat. Lighting and weapon effects are distractingly beautiful, and the sinister soundtrack is every bit as good. You could quite easily play the opening levels just looking and listening in awe. </p> <p>Fortunately, there's plenty to do as well. A surprisingly high number of elements from the original story have been worked into the plot, usually in ingenious ways: in the course of the game you will fight (rather too many) card guards, take hints from the Cheshire cat, and struggle to decipher the ramblings of the Mad Hatter. The tools you get to do the job are also fun: take your pick from lethal jacks, death-dealing dice and jack-in-the-box bombs. </p> <p>As ever, there is a price to pay for quality - and that price will probably be around \u00a3100 for a top-of-the-range graphics card. The game's demanding specifications require at least a 400MHz processor, too. </p> <p>A more legitimate gripe is the difficulty level; odd, given its use of the Quake 3 engine, that Alice features enemies significantly less intelligent than Quake 3 bots. And it might have been nice if gameplay had been weighted slightly more in favour of story ahead of mindless combat. </p> <p>Frankly, though, with its luscious visuals, relentlessly atmospheric music and intelligent level design, you will be well into the action before you notice any of these drawbacks. </p> <p>This is one game that deserves to have a little label attached saying, \"Buy me.\" (AB) </p>",

As ever, there is a price to pay for quality - and that price will probably be around \u00a3100 for a top-of-the-range graphics card. The game's demanding specifications require at least a 400MHz processor, too. A more legitimate gripe is the difficulty level; odd, given its use of the Quake 3 engine, that Alice features enemies significantly less intelligent than Quake 3 bots. And it might have been nice if gameplay had been weighted slightly more in favour of story ahead of mindless combat. Frankly, though, with its luscious visuals, relentlessly atmospheric music and intelligent level design, you will be well into the action before you notice any of these drawbacks. This is one game that deserves to have a little label attached saying, \"Buy me.\" (AB)",

      "body": "<p>It is Thursday night, and San Francisco is being battered by high winds, lashing rain and pounding seas, but inside a Chinese restaurant on the fringes of the city's Chinatown a group of 200 Apple veterans are having a whale of a time. </p> <p>It's the annual Netters' dinner, which started out 16 years ago as an intimate gathering of the handful of MacWorld attendees who had managed to connect their Macs to the internet. </p> <p>These days, the Netters take over the whole restaurant. And while Apple's slogan is \"Think Different\", they appear to be proving that geeks are still geeks, whether they have been weaned on the Mac's graphical interface or the PC's command line. In the queue for the buffet of fiery hot food there is talk of just how cool Apple's wireless networking is, at the bar there's unbridled lust for Apple's new top-end machines, and around the tables there's technically intimate my-Mac's-better-than-yours bragging between mouthfuls of kung po chicken. </p> <p>The undoubted winner of the king system bragathon, as determined by a rowdy show of hands later on, is a plump Californian who boasts a quarter of a terabyte of hard disk space, 1.5 gigabytes of memory on his desktop machine but, to jeers, \"only a gigabyte on my laptop\". </p> <p>\"What do you keep on all that?\" asks the master of ceremonies. \"Porn,\" jokes one diner, to laughter. \"Word 6,\" shouts another, referring to the notoriously bloated Microsoft product, and the attendees are rolling about, clutching their sides. It is the quip of the night. </p> <p>Spirits are high - this has been a good Macworld for Apple and its devotees. Two days earlier, Apple chief executive Steve Jobs had appeared before a cheering 5,000 strong crowd, who had stampeded into the hall with a fevered expectation normally reserved for rock stars. </p> <p>Jobs had started his 90-minute keynote with a concession - that the last few months of the previous year had been \"extremely challenging\" for Apple, and the rest of the industry. But he said he wanted to start 2001 \"with a bang\", and went on to deliver machines designed to appeal to this hardcore audience. They include a top-end G4 desktop machine with built-in SuperDrive which allows users to create CDs and DVDs for playback on household machines - a first in the PC industry. </p> <p>And he used the now famous \"and another thing\" segment at the end of his presentation, as an apparent afterthought, to introduce the sleek new G4 PowerBook, called Titanium after the metal its casing is made from. </p> <p>The machine is only an inch thick, sports a 15.1 inch wide screen and faster processors, giving performance which Apple says beats Pentium III laptops. There were whoops from the floor of the vast Moscone convention center as Jobs whipped a sheet off the new machine. One attendee at the Netters dinner claimed he had ordered his machine using his existing laptop and a wireless connection to the AppleStore website within minutes of it being unveiled. </p> <p><strong> Mac OSX</strong><br> But, despite the excitement, the hardware was not necessarily the most important announcement Apple had to make. The Mac has long needed a new operating system to match some of the features Windows users take for granted, including better protection against crashes and multitasking, and Jobs finally gave the date when the new Mac OS X will arrive in its final form - March 24. </p> <p>The new system, said Jobs, would be worth the wait: Apple had expected to sell 10,000 of its beta version of OS X - it sold 100,000, with 75,000 people giving feedback, \"some of it quite long\", joked Jobs. OS X won praise for its stability and feedback on the classic environment, which will run non-OS X programs, was also good. \"I think a lot of you were really surprised to find it actually works,\" said Jobs. </p> <p>The greatest criticisms admitted by Apple centred on missing features in the beta which will appear in the final version and, more important to these style-conscious Mac users, the aesthetics of OS X and its new Aqua interface. Jobs unveiled several subtle changes to make the switch to the new OS more palatable for Apple old-timers, including the return of the Apple menu to the top left-hand corner of the screen. </p> <p>Jobs also unveiled a number of new features in the final version which did not make the beta - including improvements to the dock, a new navigation device at the bottom of the screen which will combine many of the elements of today's control strip, launcher, Apple menu and finder and a new in-built screen saver. </p> <p>Memory requirements for the finished OS X remain high - Apple recommends that you have at least 128MB of RAM to run it - although it is only the classic environment that pushes the requirement that high: if you were to use only OS X-native applications that requirement would fall, says Apple. </p> <p>Exactly how many native applications there will be for OS X by this summer remains to be seen. The day after Jobs' keynote, Microsoft - the biggest Mac software developer - handed a major boost to the system by saying that it would release a new version of Mac Office for OS X in the autumn, only a year after its last major revision. </p> <p>But other major developers have been more reluctant to announce new versions, despite Jobs claiming repeatedly in his keynote that the bulk of new OS X applications would arrive in the summer. </p> <p>Most significantly, at the show stalls of Adobe and Quark - makers of market-leading programs Photoshop and XPress - representatives would not reveal their companies' plans for updating their applications for OS X. </p> <p><strong> Lifestyle change</strong><br> In the keynote, Jobs also revealed his vision of a \"digital lifestyle\" where increasingly sophisticated gadgets around the home are linked together - with a Mac at the centre. The digital lifestyle, he said, would include the internet and emerging movement towards digital media, including MP3 music, DVD video and programming \"broadcast\" over the net. But, instead of PCs disappearing inside glorified internet-enabled TV sets, as predicted by some, Jobs said the desktop computer's power, flexibility and superior interface would still be needed. </p> <p>He said Apple's strategy was \"laying the foundation for the next decade, possibly the next decade and a half of Apple products.\" </p> <p>Continuing this theme, Jobs unveiled the first two software products of this new era from Apple - iTunes and iDVD. iTunes, free to download from Apple's website, is an all-in-one digital music program sporting Apple's new Aqua interface, bringing together functions such as MP3 playback, cataloguing, internet radio and CD writing, which are normally only run in separate applications. While Apple's aentry into the digital music arena is late, iTunes looked impressive, offering the most important features of its paid-for rivals except the MP3 cross-mixing features included in some. </p> <p>The only complaint from the conference masses was that no current Macs can produce CDs without additional hardware and, with no new iMacs or iBooks announced at this MacExpo, consumers will still have to splash out for a CD \"burner\" to make full use of the software. </p> <p>Inevitably, there is now speculation that new iMacs and iBooks boasting CD-RW drives will appear - either at Macworld Tokyo next month (Japan buys more iMacs than any other country) or at Macworld in New York this June, where new consumer products have aften been announced. </p> <p>Similarly, iDVD looked a strong product, but out of reach of the users it seemed made for. It looked like a consumer product, with drag-and-drop simplicity, easily applied \"themes\" for DVD menus and Jobs' suggestion that you could put together some home movies and \"post them over to Grandma\". But iDVD will only come bundled with the top end G4 PowerMac - a professional machine costing \u00a32,499 plus VAT, and with standalone DVD writing machines costing thousands it is difficult to see Apple creating a huge new market with the software. </p> <p><strong> On the floor</strong><br> Away from the keynote and Apple, there were the two huge and bustling Expo halls filled with hardware and software vendors showing off their wares. With OS X around the corner, however, there was not a great deal of new software to get excited about - upgrades were largely incremental, with most vendors likely to announce their major upgrades at Macworld in New York in June. </p> <p>With big players saying little, smaller exhibitors had a chance to shine. And they did not come much smaller than the International Hypercard Users' Group. IHUG is devoted to the pioneering multimedia program distributed with pre-internet era Macs for years. </p> <p>\"We raised the $5,000 for the stand through contributions from our group on the internet\" says R Charles Flickinger, a leading light of the group dressed in an IHUG T-shirt with a floral baseball cap atop his shoulder-length grey hair. \"We just want Apple to carbonise Hypercard and bring this great program into a new era.\" </p> <p>But, I ask him, hasn't Hypercard - which has its own English-like programming language HyperTalk - been left behind by the arrival of the web and languages like Java? It is clearly a question he has been fielding all day. The full version is still on sale at the AppleStore, he points out, and play-only versions are built into the system still. </p> <p> And he's only too happy to reel off a list of applications. \"NorthWest airlines is using a custom stack [Hypercard program] to manage its airline maintainence. Nabisco is using stacks to help run the world's biggest bakery,\" he says. \"They've got Macs on the factory floor - how many places does that happen?\" </p> <p>\"Apple needs to know that Hypercard has a big user base - people who would not be using Apple computers if it wasn't for Hypercard.\" </p> <p>He leans conspiratorially towards me and adds: \"I've got a great source at Apple who tells me it would take one engineer just six months to carbonise this - yet it's not a priority. Why not?\" </p> <p>Flickinger's comments sum up the air of devotion to Mac at this biannual Apple lovefest - and a distrust for all that is not Mac. In a PC-dominated world, this is a rare opportunity for Macolites to feel part of the majority and, there's a strong antipathy towards Microsoft, despite its position as number one developer for the Mac and its huge conference stall. </p> <p>That ill-feeling can catch you unawares, sometimes. Back at the Netters dinner, deep into their show of hands voting, compere Adam Engst - author of the bestselling Internet Starter Kit for Macintosh books - polls who uses which email program. Qualcom's Eudora gets a forest of hands, but I do not quite catch the note of sarcasm in Engst's voice when he calls out \"Outlook\", and I stick my hand up without thinking, owning up to using the Microsoft program. </p> <p>The jeers, some good-natured, ring out as the five of us who owned up quickly lower our hands, shamefaced. Thinking different, at least for these Mac veterans, goes far beyond your choice of hardware - it is a way of life. </p> <p><strong> What Apple announced... </strong> </p> <p> <strong> Titanium PowerBook G4</strong> </p> <p>A lighter, thinner and more powerful remake of the PowerBook, Apple's laptop for the professional market. Key features include faster processors and a 15.2-inch wide screen TFT active-matrix display. The 400MHz version has 128MB RAM, 10GB hard drive, slot-loading CD/DVD-ROM drive, ATI Range Mobility 128 graphics card, 8MB of video memory, VGA and S-Video ports, 10/100Base-T Ethernet and FireWire and USB ports. It is available to order now from \u00a31,899 plus VAT. The 500MHz version has 256MB RAM and a 20GB hard drive. </p> <p><strong> Power Mac G4</strong> </p> <p>Apple has \"speed-bumped\" its desktop G4 range after 18 months stuck at a maxi mum processor speed of 500MHz. G4s can now come with processors at 466MHz, 533MHz, 667MHz and 733MHz, with improved internal architecture twice as fast as before. All the G4s now boast CD-RW drives and the top-end machine comes with a combination CD-RW/DVD-R SuperDrive, which allows users to read and create CDs and DVDs, which can then be played back in consumer DVD players. Memory starts at 128MB, expandable to 1.5GB. There are new graphics cards options, including the Nvidia GeForce2 MX. Hard drives are available to 60GB. Prices start at \u00a31,199 plus VAT, and go to \u00a32,499 plus VAT for the top-end machine. </p> <p><strong> Max OS X</strong> </p> <p>The much delayed next- generation operating system will finally be released in its final version on March 24. The system is a complete rewrite of the Mac OS, based on a version of Unix, although it will run your old applications in its 'classic' environment. </p> <p><strong> iTunes</strong> </p> <p>The first of two big surprises in Jobs' keynote: software that brings Apple's customary ease of use to MP3 management. iTunes plays, creates and manages MP3 music files, allowing you to organise your digital music collection, search through it and watch dramatic visual representations of the tracks. It will also help you tune into internet radio. With the top-end G4 Power Mac, iTunes will make 'burning' CD-ROMs a case of drag and drop. iTunes is available as a free download from <a href=\"http://www.apple.com\">www.apple.com</a> </p> <p><strong> iDVD</strong> </p> <p>The second of the big surprises is iDVD - an application which makes creating DVD disks for playback on ordinary DVD machines very easy. Indeed, its drag and drop 'themes' for DVDs and general straightforward interface makes it look like a consumer product. </p> <p>It's just a shame that the only Mac it comes free on, or is guaranteed to work with, is the most expensive desktop Apple produces - the 766 MHz G4, with the all-important SuperDrive to burn those DVDs.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, which ended last week, was not a place for Britons prone to a condition called \"gadget envy\". For, in a series of enormous halls, makers paraded the high-tech toys they plan to introduce into the market this year. The bad news is that by \"market\", manufacturers invariably mean the US. In many instances, European launches were not even on the agenda. So here is the best of this year's CES. Those of a jealous disposition had better look away now. </p> <p><strong> Timex internet watch</strong><br> OK, so it does not exactly access full web pages, but this $99 timepiece works with Yahoo to deliver selected internet feeds (football scores, financial news, etc) direct to your wrist. It will also receive and store emails, although you will have to find a PC if you want to answer them. </p> <p> <strong> UK launch? </strong> Do not reserve a space on your wrist just yet. There are no plans for a UK version. </p> <p> <strong> Any rivals? </strong> Samsung touted the latest version of its watch phone at CES, but was not forthcoming about possible launch dates. </p> <p><strong> RCA/Thomson MP3 player</strong><br> The latest contender for the world's smallest MP3 player, the K@zoo, can be worn on your wrist or as jewellery dangling from your neck. Its storage capacity is a not-very-generous 32MB. </p> <p> <strong> UK launch? </strong> The Americans can buy the K@zoo in March for around $179. We will have to wait until the summer. </p> <p> <strong> Any rivals? </strong> Plenty. CES was full of MP3 players from top-end models from Panasonic and Toshiba, to the cheap and cheerful from the Far East. </p> <p><strong> Dataplay discs</strong><br> Does the world really need another small storage format for digital music, images, software etc? Dataplay thinks so. Its tiny disc can store up to 500MB, yet is very cheap, with blank discs for \u00a35. </p> <p> <strong> UK launch? </strong> Both Dataplay discs and devices are scheduled to reach the UK by early 2002. </p> <p> <strong> Any rivals? </strong> Take your pick. Iomega championed both its 40MB Hip Zip optical magnetic disc, and a 20 gigabyte portable hard disk system called Peerless. Panasonic was promising 256MB SD (Secure Digital) cards by the end of the year, Sony displayed plenty of new Memory Stick products and several companies displayed devices compatible with IBM's 340MB Microdrive. </p> <p><strong> Iomega CD-R/ RW drive</strong><br> The Predator could well be the coolest looking external CD-R/RW drive ever. Early models are USB-only ($269), although there is a super-fast IEEE1394 (Firewire) compatible recorder ($329) waiting in the wings. </p> <p> <strong> UK launch? </strong> You do not have to wait too long for this one. The USB version is expected in the UK in the spring. </p> <p> <strong> Any rivals? </strong> Sony unveiled its debut CD-R/RW burner, the $400 CRX10U-A2. It is designed to work as a standalone portable PC player, too, and comes with rechargeable batteries. </p> <p><strong> Echo CD/MP3 recorder/player </strong><br> The Echo is a CD player and a MP3 recorder/player that can archive on to a built-in 6 gigabyte hard disk, yet is small enough to fit in your pocket. It also features an integrated FM radio tuner, and has an option that lets you store a tune that the DJ has just finished playing. </p> <p> <strong> UK launch? </strong> Do not bet on it. The company, <a href=\"http://www.echomobilemusic.com\">Echo Mobile Music</a> has not yet secured distribution in the US. Nice product though. </p> <p> <strong> Any rivals? </strong> IF CES is anything to go by, very soon almost every personal CD player will play back MP3 files stored on CDs. </p> <p><strong> Motorola V series mobile phone </strong><br> Could the V-66 be the Nokia-busting mobile phone that Motorola execs have been dreaming of? It is a classy makeover of the company's tiny V Series models complete with funky styling and strokeable silver finish. </p> <p> <strong> UK launch? </strong> We predict a spring/summer delivery date for the UK. The phone's spec has not yet been confirmed, though it should include a Wap browser and voice dialling facilities. </p> <p> <strong> Any rivals? </strong> Apart from a few new Samsung phones, Motorola pretty much had the show to itself. </p> <p><strong> Philips Internet radio hi-fi system </strong><br> The $400 FW-i1000 is a bog-standard mini hi-fi system that is capable of one very clever trick. Once hooked up to a broadband connection it will pull in more than 1,000 internet radio stations. </p> <p> <strong> UK launch? </strong> The key word is broadband. Philips believes there are not enough punters with ADSL connections to merit a UK launch just yet. </p> <p> <strong> Any rivals? </strong> Internet radio was big news at CES with large companies such as RCA Thomson joining a host of small Far East brands in offering standalone units. </p> <p><strong> Other CES highlights </strong><br> <strong> Sony MZ-R700DPC</strong> Sony's first MDLP-compatible MiniDisc personal player/recorder. It can store up to five hours of music on one standard MD. Due in the UK in spring. </p> <p> <strong> Harman Kardon DMC 100</strong> DVD/CD player that also features a 30 gigabyte hard drive and broadband internet connectivity. It features software that enables owners to download and CD artwork and track information. </p> <p> <strong> Casio LK-40</strong> A keyboard that teaches you how to play music by lighting up the keys before you play them. </p> <p> <strong> JVC RS-WP1</strong> A CD-based portable music system built into a rucksack. Thomson showed an MP3 player integrated into a pair of sunglasses.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, which ended last week, was not a place for Britons prone to a condition called \"gadget envy\". For, in a series of enormous halls, makers paraded the high-tech toys they plan to introduce into the market this year. The bad news is that by \"market\", manufacturers invariably mean the US. In many instances, European launches were not even on the agenda. So here is the best of this year's CES. Those of a jealous disposition had better look away now. Timex internet watch OK, so it does not exactly access full web pages, but this $99 timepiece works with Yahoo to deliver selected internet feeds (football scores, financial news, etc) direct to your wrist. It will also receive and store emails, although you will have to find a PC if you want to answer them. UK launch? Do not reserve a space on your wrist just yet. There are no plans for a UK version. Any rivals? Samsung touted the latest version of its watch phone at CES, but was not forthcoming about possible launch dates. RCA/Thomson MP3 player The latest contender for the world's smallest MP3 player, the K@zoo, can be worn on your wrist or as jewellery dangling from your neck. Its storage capacity is a not-very-generous 32MB. UK launch? The Americans can buy the K@zoo in March for around $179. We will have to wait until the summer. Any rivals? Plenty. CES was full of MP3 players from top-end models from Panasonic and Toshiba, to the cheap and cheerful from the Far East. Dataplay discs Does the world really need another small storage format for digital music, images, software etc? Dataplay thinks so. Its tiny disc can store up to 500MB, yet is very cheap, with blank discs for \u00a35. UK launch? Both Dataplay discs and devices are scheduled to reach the UK by early 2002. Any rivals? Take your pick. Iomega championed both its 40MB Hip Zip optical magnetic disc, and a 20 gigabyte portable hard disk system called Peerless. Panasonic was promising 256MB SD (Secure Digital) cards by the end of the year, Sony displayed plenty of new Memory Stick products and several companies displayed devices compatible with IBM's 340MB Microdrive. Iomega CD-R/ RW drive The Predator could well be the coolest looking external CD-R/RW drive ever. Early models are USB-only ($269), although there is a super-fast IEEE1394 (Firewire) compatible recorder ($329) waiting in the wings. UK launch? You do not have to wait too long for this one. The USB version is expected in the UK in the spring. Any rivals? Sony unveiled its debut CD-R/RW burner, the $400 CRX10U-A2. It is designed to work as a standalone portable PC player, too, and comes with rechargeable batteries. Echo CD/MP3 recorder/player The Echo is a CD player and a MP3 recorder/player that can archive on to a built-in 6 gigabyte hard disk, yet is small enough to fit in your pocket. It also features an integrated FM radio tuner, and has an option that lets you store a tune that the DJ has just finished playing. UK launch? Do not bet on it. The company, Echo Mobile Music has not yet secured distribution in the US. Nice product though. Any rivals? IF CES is anything to go by, very soon almost every personal CD player will play back MP3 files stored on CDs. Motorola V series mobile phone Could the V-66 be the Nokia-busting mobile phone that Motorola execs have been dreaming of? It is a classy makeover of the company's tiny V Series models complete with funky styling and strokeable silver finish. UK launch? We predict a spring/summer delivery date for the UK. The phone's spec has not yet been confirmed, though it should include a Wap browser and voice dialling facilities. Any rivals? Apart from a few new Samsung phones, Motorola pretty much had the show to itself. Philips Internet radio hi-fi system The $400 FW-i1000 is a bog-standard mini hi-fi system that is capable of one very clever trick. Once hooked up to a broadband connection it will pull in more than 1,000 internet radio stations. UK launch? The key word is broadband. Philips believes there are not enough punters with ADSL connections to merit a UK launch just yet. Any rivals? Internet radio was big news at CES with large companies such as RCA Thomson joining a host of small Far East brands in offering standalone units. Other CES highlights Sony MZ-R700DPC Sony's first MDLP-compatible MiniDisc personal player/recorder. It can store up to five hours of music on one standard MD. Due in the UK in spring. Harman Kardon DMC 100 DVD/CD player that also features a 30 gigabyte hard drive and broadband internet connectivity. It features software that enables owners to download and CD artwork and track information. Casio LK-40 A keyboard that teaches you how to play music by lighting up the keys before you play them. JVC RS-WP1 A CD-based portable music system built into a rucksack. Thomson showed an MP3 player integrated into a pair of sunglasses.",

Stanley was commissioned by King Leopold II of the Belgians, who gained personal title to the vast territory at the Berlin conference of 1885 and proceeded to make a tidy pile from ivory, rubber and slave labour.</p> <p>What subsequently became the Belgian Congo and, after independence, the Democratic Republic and then Mobutu's Zaire and then the Democratic Republic again has seen further, various interventions by French-led Moroccan irregulars, Belgian mercenaries, assorted UN peacekeepers, and Angolan, Cuban and Soviet-backed \"communists\".

      "bodyText": "The North Korean tank that stands guard outside the Marble Palace, the official residence of Congo's president, is a fitting symbol for a country plagued by foreign intervention since the day in 1877 when the American explorer, Henry Stanley, made his way up the Congo river and struck a deal with tribal chiefs. Stanley was commissioned by King Leopold II of the Belgians, who gained personal title to the vast territory at the Berlin conference of 1885 and proceeded to make a tidy pile from ivory, rubber and slave labour. What subsequently became the Belgian Congo and, after independence, the Democratic Republic and then Mobutu's Zaire and then the Democratic Republic again has seen further, various interventions by French-led Moroccan irregulars, Belgian mercenaries, assorted UN peacekeepers, and Angolan, Cuban and Soviet-backed \"communists\". Most recently it was the turn of Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi whose pursuit of genocidal Hutu militias was transformed in 1998 into a war in the east against their former Kinshasa puppet, Mobutu's successor, Laurent Kabila.

Dr John Riordan North West London Hospitals NHS Trust \u0095 I was dismayed by your mention of the \"delicate racial dimension\". This tip-toeing around issues of race has to stop. You seem intrigued by two black professionals who didn't take this case further. Well, the bottom line is that we're all human beings and Afro-Caribbean and Asian people may be just as incompetent as their white colleagues. Fatima Mirza Forest Row, E Sussex",

With the cabinet deeply divided on whether to pledge more constitutional change for the next term in Labour's forthcoming manifesto, the local government minister, Beverley Hughes, hinted to MPs that the party might press ahead with regional referendums to test support. In a Commons debate, Labour, the Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru - the Welsh nationalist party - backed the case for a network of English assemblies as a counterweight to devolution in Scotland, Wales, and London.

A spokeswoman for the watchdog Centre for Responsive Politics said that opposition to legislation to stop public money being earmarked for big stadiums could be involved. The presidential transition continued on Capitol Hill yesterday with a series of confirmation hearings for Mr Bush's cabinet nominees. Among them, John Ashcroft defended his record before sceptical Democrats on the Senate judiciary committee, who have argued that he is too extreme a rightwinger to hold the post of attorney general. Mr Ashcroft distanced himself from several of the more inflammatory statements he made in his role as hero of the religious right, such as a claim that gun ownership was an essential counterweight to a \"tyrannical government\". \"I really regret it if anyone is offended by it,\" he said. \"I mean no injury or disrespect to those individuals who don't have my views.\"",

Earlier the Iraqi leader's wayward son Uday had called for a map incorporated in the Iraqi parliament's emblem to be redrawn to include Kuwait as part of \"greater Iraq\". This was interpreted by Kuwait as evidence that Iraq still has territorial designs on the oil-rich state. The Iraqi deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz, described Uday's comments as a personal view, but added: \"Iraq was the victim of conspiracy against its sovereignty and its national interests, and Kuwait was part and parcel of that conspiracy. So Kuwait deserves what it had in 1990.\" Uday's views on the map of Iraq were contained in a \"working paper\" presented recently to the Iraqi parliament. In the document - a copy of which has been obtained by the Guardian - Uday accuses government officials of using sanctions to conceal their own incompetence and corruption. He also points to widespread discontent among the Iraqi public. Uday, who publishes a daily newspaper, Babel, says the poor quality of the official media has driven people to rely on \"hostile media channels\" for their news. Uday, 36, who is alleged to be heavily involved in oil smuggling, often uses his own media to denounce corruption and espouse populist causes. His election to parliament last year - with 99.9% of the vote in his Baghdad constituency, has given him an additional platform from which to pursue the rivalry with his younger brother, Qusay, 34, who appears to be Saddam's favoured successor. Uday, much feared because of his violent moods, has a playboy image but is described by opposition groups as a rapist and serial killer.",

The fact that DU rounds used by British and US forces contain far more radioactive isotopes than uranium, which are more likely to cause cancer, is bound to fuel the controversy over Gulf war syndrome. But the additional risk to British and US servicemen was minimal because the amounts of contaminants were so small, a MoD spokeswoman in London said yesterday, echoing a Nato statement issued in Brussels. The International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna was not so sure that the dangers of uranium containing even traces of plutonium were small, saying there was no data on what happened to contaminated depleted uranium when released into the atmosphere. David Kyd, spokesman for the agency, said: \"The science simply can't provide the answers in terms of the long-term consequences. It is definitely worth investigating further, not only in the Balkans but also in Iraq.\" In Germany, the defence minister, Rudolf Scharping, yesterday summoned the US charge d'affaires in Berlin to brief him on the issue. The Ministry of Defence said the increase in radiation dose to British servicemen handling the shells and operating in tanks with DU shielding because of the contaminates was only 0.8%, so small as to be minimal. However, other experts disagreed. John Large, of Large Associates, said: \"Once this has been fired in anger and is lying about in dust, there is a huge difference in the dangers.

The uranium had been supplied from the same civil source in the US and had accidently been contaminated because it had been placed in the same containers as reprocessed material. Mr Kyd emphasised that the research so far on the effects of DU was derived from monitoring miners dealing with natural uranium or the consequences of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. Over the past 10 years of controversy about the impact of particles released when DU shells hit their target, there had been no civilian research on the battlefield until Nato told the UN where to find sites it examined in Kosovo last year. The IAEA, which is taking part in the UN investigation, was offered some information about the effects of DU munitions by military sources, but Mr Kyd said it was \"still sketchy on what happens after vaporisation\". Mr Scharping also ordered a German laboratory, testing samples from Kosovo, to look specifically for traces of plutonium. The University of Bristol is also testing Kosovo samples of depleted uranium.

      "bodyText": "The government last night signalled its intent to drive through legislation, perhaps as soon as tomorrow, aimed at preventing animal activists violently intimidating staff at research laboratories. In another clear indication that the government is putting its weight behind the beleaguered research firm, Huntingdon Life Sciences (HLS), the home secretary, Jack Straw, also revealed that a one-off payment of \u00a31m would go to help Cambridgeshire police's battle against extremists. The announcements demonstrate the government's growing concern about the future of HLS, which could be forced to close tomorrow if the Royal Bank of Scotland bows to pressure from anti-vivisection campaigners and calls in a \u00a322m loan which it has been extending since August. Both Tony Blair and the science minister, Lord Sainsbury, have spoken out this week against the protesters. There is fear that jobs and millions pounds of business could be lost if laboratories like HLS are driven out of business. Mr Straw's intervention stepped up the pressure both on the protesters, who have picketed branches of the Royal Bank of Scotland this week, and on the bank itself not to withdraw the loan. Until now, both politicians and business have been accused of appeasing the animal rights lobby - and yesterday Whitehall acknowledged the point in tougher language. Mr Straw said: \"We are absolutely determined to tackle these so-called animal rights protesters, many of whom do not hesitate to use violence and intimidation to achieve their ends. It is wholly unacceptable for this small minority to attempt to stop individuals and businesses going about their legitimate business.\" Though ministers already have what Mr Straw called \"tough laws in this area\" they have ordered a rapid review of the police and criminal justice bill - the so-called \"yobs\" bill - which is due to be published tomorrow, with a view to adding late amendments. It could lead to an expansion of restrictions on what is known as \"watching and besetting\" outside people's homes - picketing houses and acting in an intimidatory way, for instance, by shouting \"scab\" during an industrial dispute. Sending intimidatory mail, a frequent tactic in the HLS dispute, may also be made harder to do by removing the \"reasonable grounds\" defence. Mr Straw's announcement alarmed civil liberty bodies who fear that a sledgehammer is again being taken to crack a nut - in ways that would jeopardise the rights of free assembly and expression, both enshrined in the 1998 Human Rights Act now in force. Mr Straw's move also failed to impress the Research Defence Society, which represents scientists in the frontline of animal rights militancy. \"These half-measures will do little or nothing to prevent the harassment, intimidation and violence that animal rights campaigners have been meting out over the last couple of years,\" said Mark Matfield, the society's executive director. Tomorrow, the Royal Bank of Scotland will decide whether to extend its loan to HLS. Campaigners have picketed the bank fiercely, calling for it to withdraw the loan. The bank is under pressure from government ministers to continue supporting the controversial lab, which has suffered a collapse in its share price as investors have pulled out of the company. Yesterday, Citibank, an arm of one of America's big banks, admitted it had severed its links with Huntingdon. Police confirmed for the first time yesterday that a series of nail bomb attacks sent through the mail to addresses in Cheshire, East Yorkshire, North Wales, West Midlands and North Yorkshire were the work of animal extremists.",

The supersonic fighters will serve on two new aircraft carriers due to enter service in 2012 at a cost of \u00a32.7bn.</p> <p>Doubts were raised about whether the George W Bush administration or US congress would sanction the JSF programme though the incoming president pledged to raise defence spending by $60bn a year. Donald Rumsfeld, Bush's defence secretary, has put all big projects under review. But Mr Hoon said yesterday he was confident it would go ahead.</p> <p>The sheer scale of the project into which the government has locked itself raises profound financial and military issues for Britain's relationship with both the US, its traditional ally, and with the emerging European joint defence force.</p> <p>Britain so far plans to buy only 150 JSFs, while the USAF, its navy and marines intend buying 3,000 of the fighters, which, according to Sir Robert Walmsley, chief of defence procurement, should cost $30m-40m each. Export orders could boost the programme to 5,000 aircraft involving both conventional and short take-off and vertical landing models.</p> <p>Mr Hoon said the JSF would play a \"crucial part in continuing our transatlantic partnership, maintaining Nato interoperability and improving European military capability\".</p> <p>Britain has one of four votes on key decisions of the project such as choice of prime contractor. Boeing and Lockheed Martin, America's two biggest defence contractors, are head to head bidders to win the lucrative contract. Industry sources said yesterday the Pentagon should choose its prime contractor in September, and production would begin in 2004, with the first planes in service in the US in 2008.</p> <p>British firms have won at least 15% of the work on the project, a share that may seem disproportionate to the US. The UK's share of the cost of the engineering, manufacturing and design phase meanwhile is just 10% (\u00a31.3bn), with a further \u00a3600m for UK communications equipment, weapons systems and missiles.</p> <p>Phil Lader, outgoing US ambassador, said the success of British firms in winning a substantial work share reflected \"transatlantic linkage\" which had seen British firms, such as BAE Systems, taking over American defence firms.</p> <p>Menzies Campbell, Liberal Democrat defence spokesman, said of the project: \"The government is between a rock and a hard place. Unless we participate, employment and technology opportunities will be lost. But if the [project] founders... it's by no means certain we'd get value for money.\"</p>",

The JSF, which will replace Royal Navy and RAF Harrier jump jets, could ultimately cost the UK \u00a310bn and create or guarantee a further 7,000 jobs. The supersonic fighters will serve on two new aircraft carriers due to enter service in 2012 at a cost of \u00a32.7bn. Doubts were raised about whether the George W Bush administration or US congress would sanction the JSF programme though the incoming president pledged to raise defence spending by $60bn a year. Donald Rumsfeld, Bush's defence secretary, has put all big projects under review. But Mr Hoon said yesterday he was confident it would go ahead. The sheer scale of the project into which the government has locked itself raises profound financial and military issues for Britain's relationship with both the US, its traditional ally, and with the emerging European joint defence force. Britain so far plans to buy only 150 JSFs, while the USAF, its navy and marines intend buying 3,000 of the fighters, which, according to Sir Robert Walmsley, chief of defence procurement, should cost $30m-40m each. Export orders could boost the programme to 5,000 aircraft involving both conventional and short take-off and vertical landing models. Mr Hoon said the JSF would play a \"crucial part in continuing our transatlantic partnership, maintaining Nato interoperability and improving European military capability\". Britain has one of four votes on key decisions of the project such as choice of prime contractor. Boeing and Lockheed Martin, America's two biggest defence contractors, are head to head bidders to win the lucrative contract. Industry sources said yesterday the Pentagon should choose its prime contractor in September, and production would begin in 2004, with the first planes in service in the US in 2008. British firms have won at least 15% of the work on the project, a share that may seem disproportionate to the US. The UK's share of the cost of the engineering, manufacturing and design phase meanwhile is just 10% (\u00a31.3bn), with a further \u00a3600m for UK communications equipment, weapons systems and missiles. Phil Lader, outgoing US ambassador, said the success of British firms in winning a substantial work share reflected \"transatlantic linkage\" which had seen British firms, such as BAE Systems, taking over American defence firms. Menzies Campbell, Liberal Democrat defence spokesman, said of the project: \"The government is between a rock and a hard place. Unless we participate, employment and technology opportunities will be lost. But if the [project] founders... it's by no means certain we'd get value for money.\"",

The mother of Liam MacIntosh brought the civil action on behalf of her son over the death of his father, Matthew Jackson, killed in a road accident in 1995 at the age of 19. Lynsey MacIntosh, 23, from Monifieth, near Dundee, had been unaware that she was pregnant at the time of her fiance's death but told the court of session in Edinburgh that Matthew Jackson would have made a wonderful father. She said Liam, born almost eight months after Mr Jackson's death, had been deprived of his father's guidance, company and financial support and would grieve when he was old enough to appreciate the circumstances of his father's death. The court heard that Liam had been told about his father, and had photos and a video of him. Mr Jackson was a passenger in a car being driven by his friend, Stuart Findlay, 19, which crossed on to the opposite carriageway near Arbroath on September 5, 1995, and collided with a lorry.

But the fame of the 31-year-old rapper and record producer better known as Puff Daddy is such that his lawyers warned the judge trying him for gun possession and bribery that it might be impossible to find a single unbiased juror. In some ways it was his fame and wealth that landed him in court in the first place. During a nightclub fracas on December 27 1999 an unidentified man - apparently incensed by the star's gold jewellery, mink coat and enormous diamond ring - is understood to have thrown thousands of dollars into his face. Jamal Barrow, aka \"Shyne\", Mr Comb's 19-year-old protege, is alleged to have taken such offence at this that he opened fire into the crowd, injuring three innocent clubgoers. Mr Combs allegedly then rushed out of the club with his girlfriend, the film star Jennifer Lopez, and his bodyguard, Anthony \"Wolf\" Jones, and began a car ride which took them across several pavements and through 11 red lights. The police officers who stopped them found a loaded gun under the passenger seat, moments after another had been tossed out of the window, according to court documents. Mr Combs is charged with offering his driver, Wardel Fenderson, $50,000 to say that the gun was his. It is claimed that he offered his $40,000 diamond ring - a gift from Ms Lopez - as collateral. Mr Barrow is charged with attempted murder, Mr Combs and Mr Jones with illegal gun possession. If found guilty Mr Combs can be jailed for 15 years. The defence lawyers say they have 30 witnesses ready to testify that Mr Combs had no gun. The rapper is using some of his estimated $400m fortune on the services of two of America's best known defence lawyers. In court yesterday he sat be tween Johnnie Cochran, who led the so-called \"dream team\" hired to defend OJ Simpson, and Ben Brafman, whose past clients include the mobster Sammy \"The Bull\" Gravano. Mr Brafman asked for a week's delay, citing what he called negative media reports about the rapper's past run-ins with the law. He said: \"A lot of what I read in the papers has been totally inaccurate and sometimes so patently false that it doesn't even warrant a response.\" The assistant district attorney, Matthew Bogdanos, has already asked for a gagging order after taking exception to some positive newspaper articles. In several interviews since being arrested, Mr Combs has spoken of the pain he was causing his two sons, Justin, six, and Quincy, eight, and his fear on the night of the fight. \"I was definitely scared to death,\" he told the New York Daily News. \"I was especially scared because I had Jennifer with me. I'm an innocent man and I want everyone to know.\" The prosecution is also afraid that the respect many rap fans feel for Puff Daddy could make it harder to select a jury. Each potential juror will face a 30-minute grilling by the defence team. Judge Charles Solomon said he was satisfied that sufficient precautions had been taken to ensure a fair trial when he denied a defence request for more time yesterday. The selection of a jury is likely to take at least a week. The trial is expected to last five weeks.",

The night following its eclipse, splendid here, it shone above Finnavara and our bay like a beautiful peach, one just plucked from the tree, with a delicate bloom, a perfect moon. It cast its light on hill and sea, warming their cold and icy look with its \"sprinkled blush\" (Marianne Moore). So the first year of the millennium has ended, though for many it now begins with 2001. What has our small country done to celebrate this past year? Each baby born on January 1, 2000 received a silver salver, and silver tokens were given to those who turned 100. How, it might be asked, did the environment fare? - it got the biggest grant. In 14 forests 1,200,000 trees (oaks and other broad-leaved varieties) were planted, one for each household, with a certificate issued of the location and species. To match this, people here paid 10 punt each to plant a belt of trees beside the new playing field. As the old Irish poem Cill Cais asks, \"Cad a dheanfaimid feasta gan adhmaid?\" (What will we do without wood?) Brigid was released on Cullenstown Strand, the 100th seal cared for and then freed from the National Sanctuary. Golden eagles, extinct here for years, will, it is hoped, fly over Donegal from their new breeding sites in Glenveagh National Park. Dublin's River Liffey was enhanced by a new pedestrian bridge and a short boardwalk. Amy Sweeney, aged 11, wrote of her hopes for the new millennium. \"That all the problems of the world - war, famine, poverty, pollution - will be solved. I also would like Sligo to win an all-Ireland football final.\" (Gaelic football)",

      "bodyText": "The surrender to the Thai authorities on Tuesday of the twin boys who led a mystical band of Burmese rebels consigns one of the world's most romantic independence movements to the history books. Ever since taking dozens of people hostage in a Thai hospital 12 months ago, Johnny and Luther Htoo's ragtag militia, God's Army, has captured the imagination of the west. These ardent Christian child warriors - thought to be barely more than 13 years old - with allegedly supernatural powers were seen as bravely standing up to the Burmese and Thai armies in their quest for a homeland for the Karen people. The deeper truth is that the boys were driven to their desperate acts by the unrelenting pressure of constant military bombardment by both the Thais and Burmese. The struggle continues The folly at the hospital in Ratchaburi, where all the hostage-takers were murdered by Thai commandos, was the last roll of the dice by a movement on the brink of elimination. But the fall of Johnny, Luther and God's Army does not mean that the wider Karen struggle for an independent homeland along the Thai-Burmese border, which began 52 years ago, has come to an end. The Karen, variously Buddhist, Buddhist-animist and Christian, fought alongside the British against the Japanese in the second world war but received no reward for their efforts. Since Burmese independence they have never really lived in peace. Although eclipsed in fame by the twins, the Karen National Union (KNU) and the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) are much larger organisations and still very much alive, if not that well. Both have suffered extremely heavy losses in the past few years as the onslaught against them has intensified. But some analysts believe that the defeats have actually transformed them, particularly the KNU, into much more effective fighting forces. Instead basing itself in big camps susceptible to attack, the Karen resistance now concentrates on hit-and-run raids. A typical recent example was an attack at the end of last year on half a dozen illegal sawmills deep inside Burma. Not only do they have to contend with the official armies, the Karen also constantly suffer at the hands of the myriad armed narcotics gangs taking their wares across the Burmese border into Thailand. It is thought that one of these gangs was responsible for the murder of six Thai villagers on December 30, although the Burmese and the Thais have tried to blame the KNU. The KNU responded immediately with a strong condemnation of the killing in a statement which also summarised the movement's goals. \"Together with the Burmese democratic forces and the non-Burman ethnic nationalities,\" it said, \"we, the KNU, are struggling for freedom and democracy, against the ruthless military dictatorship, in order to establish a peaceful and friendly Burma for all the neighbours of the country, and will always oppose tyranny, oppression and terrorism against the innocent people\". Refugee camps The most visible legacy of all this oppression is the 150,000 Karens (out of an ethnic population of about 7m) living in appalling conditions in refugee camps in Thailand. Recent research shows that tens of thousands of them have malaria, tuberculosis is rife and HIV and Aids are starting to take a grip. Foreign aid does reach the camps on a periodic basis but there are no signs of a long-term solution anywhere in sight. The same can be said for the main independence struggle. The Karen receive next to nothing by way of international support for their cause as they get squeezed into an ever smaller area. Their plight could well deteriorate further once the new Thai prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, takes office and seeks to strengthen relations with Rangoon. But despite their invisibility to most of the wider world, the Karen people show no signs of giving up their fight.",

They have survived a succession of foreign occupations, from the Persians to the Soviet Union. Vrej Nersessian, the library's Armenian specialist, said: \"We have been part of at least 30 empires - it is such a long history that time does not matter. \"The Soviets are no longer there but our culture remains. The church is a strong part of our identity.\" He recalled grimly the Turks scoffing \"Who now remembers the Armenians?\" after they had perpetrated the first act of genocide of the 20th century, wiping out vast numbers of the Armenian population in 1915. The exhibition - called Treasures from the Ark, in commemoration of the belief that Noah landed on Mount Ararat, Armenia's national symbol, after the flood - has been 10 years in the making. It will run from March 2 until May 28. Treasures on display will include an Armenian stone cross, strikingly similar to Celtic crosses dating from the same period in Ireland, reliquaries, a 17th century altar cloth from the Armenian patriarchate in Jerusalem, and even the 15th century doors from a monastery. The organisers have cajoled exhibits from 20 countries, including the Hermitage at St Petersburg and collections in Venice and Vienna, both homes of the Armenian diaspora, though not from Georgia or Iran as relations remain too fraught. The library itself already has one of the world's best collections of Armenian manuscripts, many of them donated by Lord Curzon in 1917 though it started collecting much earlier when the curators were impressed by an Armenian dictionary in 1836. The Christian world is preparing to commemorate the 1,700th anniversary of Armenia's conversion by King Trdat I and St Gregory the Illuminator. The Pope hopes to pay a visit later in the year and the Archbishop of Canterbury has spoken of the inspiration of the country's enduring faith.",

Consumer groups have welcomed the judgment, but the British Dental Association is standing by its decision to endorse Ribena ToothKind as \"a soft drink dentists can recommend with confidence\" and has renewed its accreditation. GlaxoSmithKline had challenged a ruling from the Advertising Standards Authority which said the claim was \"misleading\" and condemned posters which depicted bottles of the drink as bristles on a toothbrush.

Three \"value\" retailers - Peacocks, QS Group and Brown &amp; Jackson, which operates Poundstretcher and What Everyone Wants - issued profit warnings yesterday as they were forced to admit to lacklustre Christmas trading and pressure on profit margins. The damage has been done by companies the discounters have hurt in the past couple of years - including C&amp;A, Bhs, Littlewoods and Arcadia. C&amp;A has been holding a clearance sale before pulling out of Britain, Bhs clearing the decks with big reductions before relaunching under new managment, and Littlewoods and Arcadia - which operates clothing chains including Dorothy Perkins and Miss Selfridge - have cut prices to compete with the value chains. The discounters have been forced to trim prices further to hold on to market share - with serious impact on profit margins. The discount groups had been thriving as traditional retail names suffer.

Pricewaterhouse Coopers was commissioned to investigate the error, and while clearing the management of a cover up its report said the museum had suffered \"reputational damage\" as a result. The sum of \u00a31.74m was spent on the south portico of the Great Court as part of a renovation programme funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund. But the museum was \"deceived\" by Easton Masonry which supplied Anstude stone from France rather than Portland stone from Dorset, according to the report, published on the museum's website. In 1998 one of the companies which expected to supply the stone queried why it had not received an order and the report added that it was unfortunate that this early indication was not followed up. The problem was, in fact, first brought to light in March 1999, when the museum's project manager received a tip-off letter. A period of testing was carried out which confirmed the wrong stone had been used. The museum has withheld \u00a3200,000 of the final bill, but has confirmed that, at the moment, it is not planning any legal action. The report also criticised the museum for the lack of liaison between trustees and management and said: \"The delays in determining the facts and engaging early the professional advisers, trustees and stakeholders has resulted, more significantly, in damage to the reputation of the mu seum and those involved in its management, which might have been avoidable.\" Graham Greene, chairman of the British Museum, said: \"The British Museum regrets that its project team was unable to prevent deception by a contractor and we accept responsibility for our part in any disappointment caused. \"We are pleased that the report confirms there was no attempt at a cover up and that decisions made were appropriate, but we are determined to learn lessons for the future.\" The report is available at: The British museum website",

      "body": "<p>\"Who is this angel descending from heaven?\" sings Mandryka at the start of the second act of Richard Strauss's Arabella, as the heroine walks towards him down a colossal flight of stairs. It is a moment riddled with symbolic resonance. Mandryka is a baritone, a hunky, earthy type, a man of instinct tethered to his low voice as well as the floor of the stage. Arabella is a soprano, a creature whose voice flies above the world of mortals. Her descent of the staircase is, on one level, the progress of a seraph or goddess from the stratospheres towards earth. </p> <p>What awaits Arabella at the bottom is no terrestrial paradise but the all too human ambivalence of reality. The steps bring her not only to Mandryka, whom she loves, but also to an awareness of the sexual, moral and emotional precariousness of existence. </p> <p>The staircase is located in a Viennese ballroom, where a carnival is taking place. Amid the frenzy of couplings, the lovers lose their idealistic visions of each other. Mandryka comes to believe that his angel has descended to earth only to be transformed into a whore; Arabella has to face the fact that her dream man can be a cantankerous bully. The staircase that brought them together has also betrayed them, setting in motion events that may pull them apart. </p> <p>Staircases, by their nature, are causes of confusion. None of us knows what lies in wait for us at the bottom or top, while with each step our perspective changes. In opera, steps are blown up to become emblems of disturbance, images of moral ricketiness or metaphysical convulsion, the Jacob's ladders of the human psyche. The presence of an operatic staircase is a portent of at best chaos, and at worst catastrophe. </p> <p>Strauss, whose operas, more than those of any other composer, describe a universe reeling from Nietzsche's announcement of the \"death of God\", seems almost staircase-mad. The stage directions for Salome specify a staircase leading from Herod's palace down to the terrace where the action takes place. At the top is a world of repression, where desires are unspoken and emotions fester. At the bottom lurks a landscape of erotic savagery in which the neuroses heave their way to the surface. </p> <p>At the top of the stairs, Salome is an innocent, technically a virgin. Her descent is a gradual submersion into her own sexuality, culminating in her necrophiliac orgasm over John the Baptist's head. Herod later tries to flee his monstrous stepdaughter by retreating up the stairs, but he cannot escape. All he can do is dither halfway. </p> <p>With Elektra, Strauss pushes opera into Freudian extremism, and staircases proliferate, mirroring the opera's emphasis on the bifurcation between conscious action and subconscious thought. We see a flight of steps leading from the courtyard to the palace, but within the building, unseen by us, lurks a multiplicity of stairs that twist and turn like the psyche and lead to windows through which the characters peer in vain attempts to make sense of their lives. The guilt-ridden Klytemnestra pokes her head through one such aperture and decides that her demented daughter is calm for once. </p> <p>But her view from the staircase is deceptive. She descends, only to be savagely taunted by Elektra. Klytemnestra retreats upstairs to an illusory safety. Her murderer, her son Orest, eventually ascends after her and, having slaughtered her, waits for his next victim. Elektra cannot follow her brother inside, but leads his next victim to him. \"Watch the steps,\" she tells Aegistheus, before he too ascends to his death. Long before Hitchcock's Psycho, Strauss knew of the fear that in the dark at the top of the stairs someone with a blade is waiting to puncture your skull. </p> <p>Strauss's staircases hint not only at psychic chaos but at social change and the blurring of class boundaries. The carnival confusion into which Arabella descends is a cabmen's ball, at which social roles are reversed and servants entertain their masters. In Der Rosenkavalier, the second act takes place in the house of the upwardly mobile arms dealer Faninal, in a salon from which staircases lead both up and down. The aristocratic Octavian ascends to this midpoint to present the bourgeois Faninal's daughter Sophie with a silver rose. </p> <p>\"It's heavenly, not earthly,\" Sophie sings as she sniffs the rose. Her words might refer to the room in which they are standing, though her rapture does not last long. The boorish Baron Ochs crashes up the lower staircase after Octavian, and the web of stairs becomes a social battleground as the tottering aristocracy is forced into conflict with the emergent bourgeoisie. </p> <p>Strauss may have been the ultimate staircase composer - Arabella's stairs even have their own tune - but he was not alone. Deception and death lie in wait for Puccini's Tosca and her lover Cavaradossi on the steps of the Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome. His predatory Turandot tantalises men by despatching riddles and death from a stair-linked platform, only to be deflowered into submission when she descends. </p> <p>Berg's Lulu, the sex goddess incarnate, descends a flight of stairs to entertain the males who desire her, only to find her divinity profaned and sullied. In Lohengrin, Wagner ascribed to Antwerp cathedral a flight of steps that it does not in reality possess, and used them as the setting for the climactic showdown between Elsa and Ortrud. </p> <p>Elsa is defenceless when she moves from level ground. Ortrud can only undermine Elsa's faith in her nameless saviour when she is off the flat, and proceeds to do so, impeding her ascent. By the time Elsa gets to the top, her moral certainty is fatally undermined, and her climb has been a journey into psychological darkness. </p> <p>The process is reversed in the comedy of Die Meistersinger. Walter sings his Prize Song, which brings life to jaded aesthetic tradition, from the top of a staircase. Walter, like God, is a creator. The song is addressed to \"Eva in paradise\", and below the heroine waits for him in a world restored to its prelapsarian state. </p> <p>In John Adams's Nixon in China, steps hint at the fragility of diplomacy as political worlds collide. A rickety staircase is trundled into place beneath the presidential plane, down which the morally flawed leader of the capitalist world descends to confront the equally flawed strictures of communism. At the end of the opera, the process is reversed. Nixon climbs into his plane, the staircase is removed, and the two worlds come apart. </p> <p>Operatic producers have similarly exploited the dramatic and symbolic potential of staircases. Franco Zefirelli's staging of Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor made musical history and turned Joan Sutherland into a star when it opened in 1959. </p> <p>Sutherland, by her own admission, was no actress, though she had the extraordinary ability to move at speed while singing some of the trickiest music written. Zefirelli staged the famous mad scene on a colossal flight of stairs, up and down which Sutherland sprinted and fluttered like a wounded bird, conveying the tortuous twists of Lucia's damaged psyche. </p> <p>More controversial was Graham Vick's use of a staircase in his 1999 Glyndebourne production of Debussy's Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande, where stairs form the entrance to an alluring, deceptive prison. M\u00e9lisande, the creature of light, descends into the oppressive gilded bell jar that forms the set, where her life, drop by drop, is slowly extinguished. </p> <p>Opera illuminates the human condition by combining music and drama to probe our deepest emotions. In its strange, phantasmagoric world, the staircase is an icon of the confusion and uncertainty that govern our lives.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong> Tuesday, December 19, 2000</strong> </p> <p> Read-through of Resident Alien at New York Theatre Workshop. There are 43 people for the meet-and-greet, all called Randy or Larry. We have five kinds of doughnuts, four kinds of bagels, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, muffins, bananas, apples, crunchy granola, muesli, six kinds of tea, cinnamon hazelnut decaf ... and Bette Bourne, who plays Quentin Crisp, has a cigarette. Everyone nervously looks at the sprinkler system but says nothing. </p> <p> <strong> Wednesday, December 20</strong> </p> <p> Costume fittings. There's a whole rail of new jackets, coats, shirts, scarves and pants. Bette doesn't like any of them, so they all go away for alterations. Tom Watson, wigmeister at the Met, fits Bette for a new wig. In London he looked like a badger in a shower cap. </p> <p> <strong> Thursday, December 21</strong> </p> <p> Tim Fountain, the Bush's literary manager, arrives and moves into his apartment. It's freezing. When he complains, his landlord gives him a coat. The set is almost finished; it looks terrific. Neil Patel, the designer, has taken the original Bush Theatre design, turned it 90 degrees, put a roof on it and stuck it on the Workshop's vast stage. It looks like the Tardis floating in space. </p> <p> <strong> Friday, December 22</strong> </p> <p> The visas for the cast of Howie the Rookie have not turned up. The US consulate is about to close for Christmas and in London the office is going mad. Happy holidays. </p> <p> <strong> Christmas Day</strong> </p> <p> Helen and Flora, my partner and daughter, have arrived for Christmas. We go to Central Park with Tim to watch the skaters. The wind-chill factor is minus 19. I try to cook Christmas dinner in my apartment. This sets off the smoke alarm. The handle falls off the lavatory door and I get locked in. The others can't hear my cries for help. They're listening to Christmas With Liberace. </p> <p> <strong> Tuesday, December 26</strong> </p> <p> In America they don't have Boxing Day. Our first day on set with Resident Alien. It turns out there are two prop departments: one for \"props\" and one for \"hand props\", the latter being props that get moved about. Quentin had a television set, which he kept on the box it came in. In the play, the television set moves but the box doesn't. So the dilemma is which department is responsible for purchasing a) the television and b) the box. I suggest props buy the TV and sell the box to hand props. They do not consider this suggestion to be satirical. </p> <p> <strong> Wednesday, December 27</strong> </p> <p> The Workshop is putting on new doors. They are magnificent neo-brutalist postmodern affairs, but unfortunately they don't have any handles, so they have to take them off again. The Howie visas still haven't arrived. </p> <p> <strong> Friday, December 29</strong> </p> <p> Still no visas. Tom Watson turns up with the new wig. It's fabulous. He fits it on Bette. \"You will be here every night to do this, won't you darling?\" says Bette. \"I'm sorry,\" says Tom, \"but I've got other work on.\" \"Who could be more important than me?\" jokes Bette. After a beautifully measured pause, Tom says, \"Pavarotti.\" Bette is silent. </p> <p>The Weather Channel says there is a snowstorm brewing, the biggest since 1996, with 8in to 10in of snow expected. Fiona Clark, executive producer at the Bush, is due to fly in from London. After five hours on the tarmac her plane is cancelled. </p> <p> <strong> Saturday, December 30</strong> </p> <p> Fiona and the snow blow in to New York - Fiona via Washington and several planes, trains and automobiles. The city closes down. Tim moves out of freezing apartment and into new pad. Disturbed in the middle of the night, he looks up through his skylight. A plague of rats looks back. He moves into a hotel. </p> <p> <strong> New Year's Eve</strong> </p> <p> Fourteen inches of snow. Flora and Helen having gone back, I spend the evening in a rock'n'roll bar watching a Frank Zappa tribute band with half of Circus Oz and a Vietnam vet called Charlie. I am really too old for this kind of thing, but then Fiona falls asleep before midnight, so who knows? </p> <p> <strong> New Year's Day, 2001</strong> </p> <p> Fiona is permanently on the phone to the Bush, the actors, the consulate and the state department. The Howie boys will not be leaving today. Their set has arrived at its venue, PS122, and Gareth, our technical director, and Steve, their technician, start practising their Irish accents. </p> <p> <strong> Tuesday, January 2</strong> </p> <p> At the Workshop we tech Resident Alien and in the evening we do the first stagger-through. Fiona has ascertained that the Howie visas were processed last week but are sitting in a mailbag in Grosvenor Square. The boys - Karl Shiels and Aidan Kelly - finally arrive in New York at midnight, to be met by Fiona and Mark Russell of PS122. They drink heavily. </p> <p> <strong> Wednesday, January 3</strong> </p> <p> We tech Howie in the morning, dress-rehearse Resident Alien in the afternoon, and preview Howie in the evening. The boys are magnificent. More drinking. Mark Ravenhill shows up for a wedding and joins the party. </p> <p> <strong> Thursday, January 4</strong> </p> <p> We attend a snow-machine training session at the Workshop but the motor fails to materialise. Production manager Larry Ash has to work it from up a ladder. Outside it snows. At 7pm we do the public dress of Resident Alien and are suddenly struck by the poignancy of doing this show just a block from where Quentin lived. At PS122 Fiona sees the opening night of Howie. Larry Eilenberg, artistic director of the Magic Theatre in San Francisco, turns up - Howie tours there next. There's an amazing buzz. </p> <p> <strong> Friday, January 5</strong> </p> <p> First preview of Resident Alien. Press in to see Howie. Ben Brantley from the New York Times sees Howie.

      "bodyText": "Tuesday, December 19, 2000 Read-through of Resident Alien at New York Theatre Workshop. There are 43 people for the meet-and-greet, all called Randy or Larry. We have five kinds of doughnuts, four kinds of bagels, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, muffins, bananas, apples, crunchy granola, muesli, six kinds of tea, cinnamon hazelnut decaf ... and Bette Bourne, who plays Quentin Crisp, has a cigarette. Everyone nervously looks at the sprinkler system but says nothing. Wednesday, December 20 Costume fittings. There's a whole rail of new jackets, coats, shirts, scarves and pants. Bette doesn't like any of them, so they all go away for alterations. Tom Watson, wigmeister at the Met, fits Bette for a new wig. In London he looked like a badger in a shower cap. Thursday, December 21 Tim Fountain, the Bush's literary manager, arrives and moves into his apartment. It's freezing. When he complains, his landlord gives him a coat. The set is almost finished; it looks terrific. Neil Patel, the designer, has taken the original Bush Theatre design, turned it 90 degrees, put a roof on it and stuck it on the Workshop's vast stage. It looks like the Tardis floating in space. Friday, December 22 The visas for the cast of Howie the Rookie have not turned up. The US consulate is about to close for Christmas and in London the office is going mad. Happy holidays. Christmas Day Helen and Flora, my partner and daughter, have arrived for Christmas. We go to Central Park with Tim to watch the skaters. The wind-chill factor is minus 19. I try to cook Christmas dinner in my apartment. This sets off the smoke alarm. The handle falls off the lavatory door and I get locked in. The others can't hear my cries for help. They're listening to Christmas With Liberace. Tuesday, December 26 In America they don't have Boxing Day. Our first day on set with Resident Alien. It turns out there are two prop departments: one for \"props\" and one for \"hand props\", the latter being props that get moved about. Quentin had a television set, which he kept on the box it came in. In the play, the television set moves but the box doesn't. So the dilemma is which department is responsible for purchasing a) the television and b) the box. I suggest props buy the TV and sell the box to hand props. They do not consider this suggestion to be satirical. Wednesday, December 27 The Workshop is putting on new doors. They are magnificent neo-brutalist postmodern affairs, but unfortunately they don't have any handles, so they have to take them off again. The Howie visas still haven't arrived. Friday, December 29 Still no visas. Tom Watson turns up with the new wig. It's fabulous. He fits it on Bette. \"You will be here every night to do this, won't you darling?\" says Bette. \"I'm sorry,\" says Tom, \"but I've got other work on.\" \"Who could be more important than me?\" jokes Bette. After a beautifully measured pause, Tom says, \"Pavarotti.\" Bette is silent. The Weather Channel says there is a snowstorm brewing, the biggest since 1996, with 8in to 10in of snow expected. Fiona Clark, executive producer at the Bush, is due to fly in from London. After five hours on the tarmac her plane is cancelled. Saturday, December 30 Fiona and the snow blow in to New York - Fiona via Washington and several planes, trains and automobiles. The city closes down. Tim moves out of freezing apartment and into new pad. Disturbed in the middle of the night, he looks up through his skylight. A plague of rats looks back. He moves into a hotel. New Year's Eve Fourteen inches of snow. Flora and Helen having gone back, I spend the evening in a rock'n'roll bar watching a Frank Zappa tribute band with half of Circus Oz and a Vietnam vet called Charlie. I am really too old for this kind of thing, but then Fiona falls asleep before midnight, so who knows? New Year's Day, 2001 Fiona is permanently on the phone to the Bush, the actors, the consulate and the state department. The Howie boys will not be leaving today. Their set has arrived at its venue, PS122, and Gareth, our technical director, and Steve, their technician, start practising their Irish accents. Tuesday, January 2 At the Workshop we tech Resident Alien and in the evening we do the first stagger-through. Fiona has ascertained that the Howie visas were processed last week but are sitting in a mailbag in Grosvenor Square. The boys - Karl Shiels and Aidan Kelly - finally arrive in New York at midnight, to be met by Fiona and Mark Russell of PS122. They drink heavily. Wednesday, January 3 We tech Howie in the morning, dress-rehearse Resident Alien in the afternoon, and preview Howie in the evening. The boys are magnificent. More drinking. Mark Ravenhill shows up for a wedding and joins the party. Thursday, January 4 We attend a snow-machine training session at the Workshop but the motor fails to materialise. Production manager Larry Ash has to work it from up a ladder. Outside it snows. At 7pm we do the public dress of Resident Alien and are suddenly struck by the poignancy of doing this show just a block from where Quentin lived. At PS122 Fiona sees the opening night of Howie. Larry Eilenberg, artistic director of the Magic Theatre in San Francisco, turns up - Howie tours there next. There's an amazing buzz. Friday, January 5 First preview of Resident Alien. Press in to see Howie. Ben Brantley from the New York Times sees Howie. I walk between the two theatres in the snow. This is mad. Tuesday, January 9 6.30am: Fiona is at the airport. She's going to Chicago to meet producers interested in Howie. She buys the New York Times. The review is out - it's phenomenal. She calls me. She calls everyone. We are over the moon. Don't fully comprehend the significance of this until the phones start ringing, and ringing, and ringing. In Chicago, Fiona gets the same response.

      "body": "<p>BBC executives are planning an overhaul of the Ten O'Clock News amid fears of falling ratings and increased competition from ITV's revived 10pm bulletin. </p> <p>In a memo that has caused staff concern, BBC news chiefs said the programme would have a \"broader agenda\" and \"more intelligent coverage\". A former ITN editor takes over after the general election, and some fear he will import a populist agenda to the bulletin, which has concentrated on politics and foreign news. Some Ten O'Clock News journalists are reportedly upset at the slur about coverage not being intelligent enough. </p> <p>But executives are understood to be concerned at the prospect of a head-to-head clash with ITV's News at Ten, which returns to screens on Monday. This week, the BBC Ten O'Clock News recorded its lowest ratings since being moved from the 9pm slot last year, scoring 3.4m viewers on Monday night. </p> <p>The BBC director general, Greg Dyke, is thought to believe the old Nine O'Clock News too austere, and be keen to recreate a bulletin with the impact of ITV's old News at Ten. He supports the new editor, Mark Popescu, responsible for relaunching the BBC's Six O'Clock News. </p> <p>One BBC producer said the \"middle class intellectuals\" behind the 10pm bulletin were worried: a staff member reportedly said Mr Popescu's agenda would be \"more Madonna than Macedonia\". </p> <p>But executives said such reports were \"twaddle\". In a memo signed by the deputy director of news, Richard Sambrook, and the head of television news, Roger Mosey, staff were told the Ten O'Clock News would be more ambitious and make more use of specialist correspondents. </p> <p>The comments raised eyebrows at the BBC.

      "bodyText": "BBC executives are planning an overhaul of the Ten O'Clock News amid fears of falling ratings and increased competition from ITV's revived 10pm bulletin. In a memo that has caused staff concern, BBC news chiefs said the programme would have a \"broader agenda\" and \"more intelligent coverage\". A former ITN editor takes over after the general election, and some fear he will import a populist agenda to the bulletin, which has concentrated on politics and foreign news. Some Ten O'Clock News journalists are reportedly upset at the slur about coverage not being intelligent enough. But executives are understood to be concerned at the prospect of a head-to-head clash with ITV's News at Ten, which returns to screens on Monday. This week, the BBC Ten O'Clock News recorded its lowest ratings since being moved from the 9pm slot last year, scoring 3.4m viewers on Monday night. The BBC director general, Greg Dyke, is thought to believe the old Nine O'Clock News too austere, and be keen to recreate a bulletin with the impact of ITV's old News at Ten. He supports the new editor, Mark Popescu, responsible for relaunching the BBC's Six O'Clock News. One BBC producer said the \"middle class intellectuals\" behind the 10pm bulletin were worried: a staff member reportedly said Mr Popescu's agenda would be \"more Madonna than Macedonia\". But executives said such reports were \"twaddle\". In a memo signed by the deputy director of news, Richard Sambrook, and the head of television news, Roger Mosey, staff were told the Ten O'Clock News would be more ambitious and make more use of specialist correspondents. The comments raised eyebrows at the BBC. One journalist said: \"The Ten O'Clock News people think they are the top brains in the BBC. You can imagine how that went down.\" The BBC chairman, Sir Christopher Bland, had said that if audiences fell drastically the news would be moved back to 9pm, and he promised a review in a year's time. But that commitment is watered down; in yesterday's memo, Mr Sambrook and Mr Mosey said success would be judged over \"a couple of years\". Some in the BBC believe Mr Popescu must ease out the programme's current presenters.

The scientific community fears that, should the facility close, it would end Britain's reputation as a centre of excellence in science and research. \"We'd become known as a world leader in the world of animal rights terrorism instead,\" says a spokesman for Harlan UK, the leading privately owned wholesaler of laboratory animals, and itself a target.</p> <p>Such sentiments will be taken as a compliment at the more extreme end of the animal welfare movement, a diverse community that spans a broad spectrum. At one end are the mainstream lobbying groups such as the RSPCA and the International Fund for Animal Welfare (Ifaw), groups that draw on the Brits' soft spot for animals to fuel the letter writing campaigns and placard-waving demonstrations by which they lobby for change.</p> <p>Away from the mainstream however lies a loose collection of activists, allied more by common purpose than action, who favour more extreme measures. The committed volunteers of the Hunt Saboteurs Association regularly rise at 4am throughout the winter in order to place themselves in between a hunt and its prey. But they rarely go further than obstruction and the occasional scrap.</p> <p>Other individuals and groups are willing to harass employees of animal testing laboratories and hunts, smash windows at meatpacking factories, firebomb haulage firms involved in live animal transportation, plant incendiary devices under cars and even post parcels packed with homemade explosives, nails and ballbearings.</p> <p>There has been a spate of such actions recently. Since September three members of the Old Surrey and Burstow hunt have had incendiary devices planted under their cars in attacks believed to be connected to serious injuries received by a saboteur, Steve Christmas, who was run down on a hunt in September. A man has been charged with GBH with intent.</p> <p>Since December 15, six letter bombs have been received at addresses in the north of England, Wales and the West Midlands. A chip shop, pet shop and estate agency were among the targets. A girl was injured and a woman could lose the sight in an eye.</p> <p>No one has claimed responsibility for the attacks but North Yorkshire police confirmed yesterday that they believe animal activists are to blame. So seriously are the attacks being taken that, for only the third time in police history, a formal \"linked investigation\" headed by North Yorkshire and involving more than 50 officers is being undertaken.</p> <p>The Animal Liberation Front (ALF) is as close as this radical end of the movement gets to an organising force. Founded 25 years ago, the ALF has no membership and no designated leaders. \"The ALF could be said only to exist for the period it takes to carry out an act of ALF policy,\" says Robin Webb, the front's veteran spokesman.</p> <p><b> Extreme measures</b><br></p> <p>\"We aim to release and protect animals in danger, and support economic sabotage to the businesses and property of animal abusers, looking to put them out of business, but we do not support any action that puts any life, animal or human, in danger,\" he says. Broadly speaking, fire bombing an empty car is acceptable, sending a nail bomb is not.</p> <p>Beyond the ALF are groups such as the Animal Rights Militia, the Hunt Retribution Squad and the Justice Department. These groups favour more extreme measures. \"They see themselves as like the ANC in South Africa,\" says Mr Webb. \"Their argument is that if you believe that life is of intrinsic value then it is justifiable to commit short-term violence in the interests of a longer peace.\"</p> <p>Mr Webb claims the current spate of incidents does not mark the start of an organised militant campaign. Most acts are carried out by individuals or cells of two or three people with limited resources. \"You get peaks and troughs of activity and we're in a peak right now. There is an awful lot of disillusionment and frustration around though, and if you are asking is it likely that animal abusers will be assassinated, I think it is probable.\"</p> <p>Graham (not his real name) was an activist with an extreme group in the early 90s and admits to planting incendiary devices. He supports Mr Webb's analysis of the current spate of activity.</p> <p>\"The movement is only as organised as people can be botherd to be. We used to plant devices and then read in the papers about being a major terrorist threat - it used to make us laugh,\" he says. \"You can make a firebomb for \u00a31.50, buying all the bits in Woolworths, and cause \u00a3500,000 of damage.</p> <p>\"Recruitment is really haphazard and ad hoc. You might be involved in some naughty stuff yourself and spot someone who is quite militant who lives in, say, Middlesbrough. You might pass them a leaflet or a video in the hope of setting up another cell.</p> <p>\"I was recruited like that. Someone sent me a video anonymously with a note that said 'You might be interested in this'. It showed someone making devices.</p> <p>\"These things go in waves. People are part of the same social scene, maybe doing a bit of [hunt] sabbing on the weekend, a bit of grafitti and it grows from there. There's this understanding that people find their level. It might be smashing windows, it might be a nail bomb. Someone has a success so someone else has a go. It lasts for a while and then the police make a few arrests and things go quiet.\"</p> <p>But since the early 90s there has been a shift away from isolated incidents towards targeted campaigns of direct action and harassment. Under the umbrella of the Animal Rights Coalition, a loose grouping of activists who share information via a website and newsletter, tactics and methods have been refined to great effect.</p> <p>Several small animal farms have been closed by these tactics and HLS, targeted by the sophisticated and dogged group Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty (Shac), would be the greatest scalp yet.</p> <p>Led by Gregg Avery, who was jailed last year for four months after threatening to kill an HLS executive, Shac has some 10,000 subscribers to its mailing list. Around 1,000 people visit the website every day.</p> <p>HLS has always claimed that its work is crucial in the development of medicines but demonstrators point out that products such as weedkiller, fertiliser and domestic cleaning products are tested on animals there. A Channel 4 documentary screened in 1997 showed beagle puppies being abused by staff, and undercover investigations have produced evidence of maltreatment of monkeys, mice and rats.</p> <p>According to the Research Defence Association, which represents medical researchers in the debate over animal research, Shac is the Animal Liberation Front by another name. They believe there are a dozen hardcore campaigners nationwide who they will continue to have success in closing down small animal suppliers and breeders unless legislation banning demonstrations is introduced.</p> <p>The home secretary, Jack Straw, yesterday indicated that he would consider new measures. Under the new Terrorism Act, which broadens the definition of terrorism to include \"the use or threat, for the purpose of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause, of action which involves serious violence against any person or property\", MI5 may have an increased role.</p> <p>Counter-terrorism and protecting Britain's economic wellbeing are central functions of the service. Should the financial interests of British science be threatened, Shac, the ALF and others may find themselves facing formidable opposition.</p> <p><b>Hunger strikes, threats and anger in the world of the activists</b></p> <p><b> Barry Horne</b><br></p> <p>Horne's prison hunger strikes have made him one of the animal rights movement's most famous names. To hardcore activists, he is a prisoner of conscience.</p> <p>Horne was jailed for 18 years following an Animal Liberation Front firebomb attack on the Isle of Wight, which caused \u00a33m of damage. He has been on hunger strike three times. During one strike, supporters drew up a hit list of 10 scientists and breeders who they said would be assassinated if he died.</p> <p>During his most famous hunger strike in the autumn of 1998, his supporters claimed he was close to death. But his campaign was undermined by claims that he had drunk orange juice and sugary tea and was not as ill as had been made out. Horne, 48, is in the high-security Belmarsh prison in south-east London and remains a category A inmate.</p> <p><b> Robin Webb </b><br></p> <p>Webb has never made any secret of his role as an animal rights activist. As a self-styled spokesman for the Animal Liberation Front, the 56-year-old has long been the public face of a movement with no formal membership.</p> <p>Believed to be a leading player in the loose network of animal welfare extremists, he says he is the target of MI5 surveillance and warns reporters that his phone calls are monitored.</p> <p>Webb only concedes ALF responsibility for actions that do not injure or kill, laying more extreme action at the door of anonymous groups such as the Hunt Retribution Squad. He says that in 25 years no-one has been injured or killed as a result of an ALF action.</p> <p>He claims not to know who is responsible for nail bomb attacks in the north of England: \"The ALF would not condemn or condone such actions but we would understand the anger and frustration that would lead people to action of this kind,\" he said.</p> <p>Webb was remanded in custody in 1995 for seven months on a public order charge linked to a food-contamination hoax, but was acquitted at trial.</p> <p><b>Related stories</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,423757,00.html\">Company that fell from grace</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,423734,00.html\">Comment: Treating animals with cruelty</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,423756,00.html\">Huntingdon Life: facing collapse in 36 hours\"</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,423755,00.html\">Workers living in fear</a></p>",

The committed volunteers of the Hunt Saboteurs Association regularly rise at 4am throughout the winter in order to place themselves in between a hunt and its prey. But they rarely go further than obstruction and the occasional scrap. Other individuals and groups are willing to harass employees of animal testing laboratories and hunts, smash windows at meatpacking factories, firebomb haulage firms involved in live animal transportation, plant incendiary devices under cars and even post parcels packed with homemade explosives, nails and ballbearings. There has been a spate of such actions recently. Since September three members of the Old Surrey and Burstow hunt have had incendiary devices planted under their cars in attacks believed to be connected to serious injuries received by a saboteur, Steve Christmas, who was run down on a hunt in September. A man has been charged with GBH with intent. Since December 15, six letter bombs have been received at addresses in the north of England, Wales and the West Midlands. A chip shop, pet shop and estate agency were among the targets. A girl was injured and a woman could lose the sight in an eye. No one has claimed responsibility for the attacks but North Yorkshire police confirmed yesterday that they believe animal activists are to blame. So seriously are the attacks being taken that, for only the third time in police history, a formal \"linked investigation\" headed by North Yorkshire and involving more than 50 officers is being undertaken. The Animal Liberation Front (ALF) is as close as this radical end of the movement gets to an organising force. Founded 25 years ago, the ALF has no membership and no designated leaders. \"The ALF could be said only to exist for the period it takes to carry out an act of ALF policy,\" says Robin Webb, the front's veteran spokesman. Extreme measures \"We aim to release and protect animals in danger, and support economic sabotage to the businesses and property of animal abusers, looking to put them out of business, but we do not support any action that puts any life, animal or human, in danger,\" he says. Broadly speaking, fire bombing an empty car is acceptable, sending a nail bomb is not. Beyond the ALF are groups such as the Animal Rights Militia, the Hunt Retribution Squad and the Justice Department. These groups favour more extreme measures. \"They see themselves as like the ANC in South Africa,\" says Mr Webb. \"Their argument is that if you believe that life is of intrinsic value then it is justifiable to commit short-term violence in the interests of a longer peace.\" Mr Webb claims the current spate of incidents does not mark the start of an organised militant campaign. Most acts are carried out by individuals or cells of two or three people with limited resources. \"You get peaks and troughs of activity and we're in a peak right now. There is an awful lot of disillusionment and frustration around though, and if you are asking is it likely that animal abusers will be assassinated, I think it is probable.\" Graham (not his real name) was an activist with an extreme group in the early 90s and admits to planting incendiary devices. He supports Mr Webb's analysis of the current spate of activity. \"The movement is only as organised as people can be botherd to be. We used to plant devices and then read in the papers about being a major terrorist threat - it used to make us laugh,\" he says. \"You can make a firebomb for \u00a31.50, buying all the bits in Woolworths, and cause \u00a3500,000 of damage. \"Recruitment is really haphazard and ad hoc. You might be involved in some naughty stuff yourself and spot someone who is quite militant who lives in, say, Middlesbrough. You might pass them a leaflet or a video in the hope of setting up another cell. \"I was recruited like that. Someone sent me a video anonymously with a note that said 'You might be interested in this'. It showed someone making devices. \"These things go in waves. People are part of the same social scene, maybe doing a bit of [hunt] sabbing on the weekend, a bit of grafitti and it grows from there. There's this understanding that people find their level. It might be smashing windows, it might be a nail bomb. Someone has a success so someone else has a go. It lasts for a while and then the police make a few arrests and things go quiet.\" But since the early 90s there has been a shift away from isolated incidents towards targeted campaigns of direct action and harassment. Under the umbrella of the Animal Rights Coalition, a loose grouping of activists who share information via a website and newsletter, tactics and methods have been refined to great effect. Several small animal farms have been closed by these tactics and HLS, targeted by the sophisticated and dogged group Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty (Shac), would be the greatest scalp yet. Led by Gregg Avery, who was jailed last year for four months after threatening to kill an HLS executive, Shac has some 10,000 subscribers to its mailing list. Around 1,000 people visit the website every day. HLS has always claimed that its work is crucial in the development of medicines but demonstrators point out that products such as weedkiller, fertiliser and domestic cleaning products are tested on animals there. A Channel 4 documentary screened in 1997 showed beagle puppies being abused by staff, and undercover investigations have produced evidence of maltreatment of monkeys, mice and rats. According to the Research Defence Association, which represents medical researchers in the debate over animal research, Shac is the Animal Liberation Front by another name. They believe there are a dozen hardcore campaigners nationwide who they will continue to have success in closing down small animal suppliers and breeders unless legislation banning demonstrations is introduced. The home secretary, Jack Straw, yesterday indicated that he would consider new measures. Under the new Terrorism Act, which broadens the definition of terrorism to include \"the use or threat, for the purpose of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause, of action which involves serious violence against any person or property\", MI5 may have an increased role. Counter-terrorism and protecting Britain's economic wellbeing are central functions of the service. Should the financial interests of British science be threatened, Shac, the ALF and others may find themselves facing formidable opposition. Hunger strikes, threats and anger in the world of the activists Barry Horne Horne's prison hunger strikes have made him one of the animal rights movement's most famous names. To hardcore activists, he is a prisoner of conscience. Horne was jailed for 18 years following an Animal Liberation Front firebomb attack on the Isle of Wight, which caused \u00a33m of damage. He has been on hunger strike three times. During one strike, supporters drew up a hit list of 10 scientists and breeders who they said would be assassinated if he died. During his most famous hunger strike in the autumn of 1998, his supporters claimed he was close to death. But his campaign was undermined by claims that he had drunk orange juice and sugary tea and was not as ill as had been made out. Horne, 48, is in the high-security Belmarsh prison in south-east London and remains a category A inmate. Robin Webb Webb has never made any secret of his role as an animal rights activist. As a self-styled spokesman for the Animal Liberation Front, the 56-year-old has long been the public face of a movement with no formal membership. Believed to be a leading player in the loose network of animal welfare extremists, he says he is the target of MI5 surveillance and warns reporters that his phone calls are monitored. Webb only concedes ALF responsibility for actions that do not injure or kill, laying more extreme action at the door of anonymous groups such as the Hunt Retribution Squad. He says that in 25 years no-one has been injured or killed as a result of an ALF action. He claims not to know who is responsible for nail bomb attacks in the north of England: \"The ALF would not condemn or condone such actions but we would understand the anger and frustration that would lead people to action of this kind,\" he said. Webb was remanded in custody in 1995 for seven months on a public order charge linked to a food-contamination hoax, but was acquitted at trial.

So they were quick to say yesterday that his death at the hands of one of his own soldiers presented a chance to end a conflict that has claimed more than 1m lives.

This will offer online share dealing in 15 stock market and a supermarket of 175 investment funds.</p> <p>Halifax is shortly due to launch its offering, a private bank using its subsidiary, St James's Place Capital.</p> <p>The mass affluent are those with between \u00a325,000 to \u00a3250,000 to invest. Many have acquired the money through events that are far from out of the ordinary, such as owning a property in an area where prices have risen steeply. </p> <p>It is estimated around 11 million people now fall into this category, with around four million people having at least \u00a350,000 in liquid assets. </p> <p>Abbey National believes this group will grow by 9% a year and that the potential market is worth \u00a3600 billion. Two thirds of those who fall into the mass affluent category are male and aged 45 to 64.</p> <p>But some independent financial advisers are critical of what's on offer.

      "bodyText": "Britain's growing number of 'mass affluent' people now not only have to ponder how to spend their money, they also have to decide between a plethora of new banks and advisers, all of whom want to look after it. The provision of wealth management services has become a major new industry in the UK, but some independent advisers are questioning whether some services provided by banks offer sufficient choice for investments. Abbey National's Inscape venture and NatWest private banking are among the high street names targeting the mass affluent - or in Abbey National' words, \"the privileged many.\" Others include Alliance &amp; Leicester, which has also launched a web-based wealth management service and Credit Suisse recently set up a web portal aimed at those with \u00a330,000 or more to invest. This will offer online share dealing in 15 stock market and a supermarket of 175 investment funds. Halifax is shortly due to launch its offering, a private bank using its subsidiary, St James's Place Capital. The mass affluent are those with between \u00a325,000 to \u00a3250,000 to invest. Many have acquired the money through events that are far from out of the ordinary, such as owning a property in an area where prices have risen steeply. It is estimated around 11 million people now fall into this category, with around four million people having at least \u00a350,000 in liquid assets. Abbey National believes this group will grow by 9% a year and that the potential market is worth \u00a3600 billion. Two thirds of those who fall into the mass affluent category are male and aged 45 to 64. But some independent financial advisers are critical of what's on offer. Craig Wetton, marketing manager for Bath-based Chartwell Investment Management says: \"Many IFAs are able to offer a virtually the same service to these banks and in some cases it is a lot better. Some banks expect clients to buy their own investment products, which is some cases have performed appallingly. It is not good for anyone to be with a bank that skews its products towards one provider.\" NatWest, which launched its private banking arm for those with more than \u00a375,000 to invest has no up front charges, but it does required that at least \u00a375,00 is invested within the NatWest group. The newcomers have also placed pressure on existing providers of wealth management services. Martin Smith, managing director of Close Wealth Management, which is part of the private bank, Close Brothers, says he believes many of these new providers will not do enough to educate clients. \"It is vital that clients understand the concept of risk and return and in particular the benefits of investing directly and avoiding hidden charges.\" Smith says so-called stealth charges are a serious problem. \"We don't invest any of our clients' money in unit trusts, for example. These are not transparent and equally insurance with-profit bonds tend to have lots of charges and be awful investments.\" He explains that Close instead uses five model portfolios based on blue chip shares, gilts and investment trusts. Despite the growth of wealth management services, those at the top of the market say they are not threatened by the new providers. Coutts, for example seeks clients with at least \u00a3500,000 in liquid assets. But Coutts does face a challenge from Rothschilds, which is launching a pan-European venture aimed at the super rich.",
