He has also ordered him to take part in six months of community service, including visits to hospitals, old people's homes and schools. </p> <p>However, the apparent lack of contrition displayed by Collymore in attempting to dismiss his behaviour as the norm is certain to intensify O'Neill's anger only a week after offering the controversial 29-year-old a chance to salvage his career. </p> <p>\"Maybe in the circumstances I will hold up my hands and say it was naivety but at the end of the day I haven't killed anybody,\" said Collymore. \"OK, I let off a fire extinguisher and it was a mistake.

I feel bad that everyone has jumped on the bandwagon and it has caused embarrassment to the club. I fully accept the fine but a million players have done it and a million more will in the future. It seems there are certain high-profile players who cannot have fun these days. The bottom line is that everyone knows the stories and everyone knows about Stan Collymore, when I just want a laugh with the lads. The alternative is to sit at home, not go out and not enjoy the best years of your life.\" </p> <p>Collymore let off the fire extinguisher after several hours of drinking with his new colleagues in the Piano Bar of the five-star Hyatt Regency Hotel. The incident led to the entire Leicester squad being thrown out and banned less than 24 hours after arriving at the 1,400-acre complex for a three-day break as part of their preparations for the Worthington Cup final against Tranmere Rovers. </p> <p>\"In football parlance Stan is now on a yellow card. That means if anything else happens he'll be in serious danger of losing his job,\" said O'Neill. </p> <p>\"When I signed Stan I always felt he would be involved in an incident that would make me wonder if it was a sackable offence, perhaps after six or seven weeks but definitely not just five or six days. </p> <p>\"No doubt there are a lot of people saying 'I told you so' and I could not argue with them at the moment. If he gets that red card, then I will have to say I have definitely failed. </p> <p>\"I signed Stan because he is a talented player who has been wasting every single Saturday of his life for the last 12 months. These events suggest that maybe I need my head examining but I still believe he was a risk worth taking. This is his last chance and there is still an opportunity for him to prove everyone wrong.\" </p> <p>O'Neill, who had been due to join his team a day late, called them home immediately after the club's assistant manager John Robertson interrupted his breakfast on Wednesday morning with a telephone call which began with the words: \"You won't be happy with this.\" </p> <p>He has warned several other players about their conduct, as well as admonishing Robertson for his lack of supervision. The estimated \u00a316,000 costs of the abortive trip, which include the bill for the damage caused, will be deducted from the wages of everyone involved and plans for an end-of-season break in the Caribbean have been scrapped. </p> <p>A week earlier O'Neill had hailed Collymore's signing from Aston Villa as the final chance for the player to re-establish himself after the off-field problems that have plagued his turbulent career. Collymore is still having counselling for clinical depression and O'Neill hopes his new signing will benefit from the community-based work. \"It will do him good to see how the other half live.

(Education questions are conducted almost entirely in jargon. Speaking about schools with specialist status, Mr Blunkett promised to `cascade both their resources and their work outwards', whatever that might mean.) Finally Theresa May rose to complain that the government had failed to fund the teachers' pay award. It was, she trembled, `the mathe matics of the madhouse! `This government is all mouth and no delivery!' she added, as I silently shouted: `trousers, the correct phrase is `no trousers'.' Mr Bercow's moment came next. Why should grammar schools be forced to become non-selective because of `10 local malcontents'? he asked. Estelle Morris, the minister, seized on this. `Aha, the new Tory word for `parents' - they are `malcontents'!' Mr Bercow looked glum as his phantom rottweiler slumbered beside him. The four female Labour education ministers then filed out for the obligatory orgy scene - yes, yes, I did make that up.",

The Madonna and Child by Cimabue, thought to have been painted around 1274, was found at Benacre Hall, Southwold, by experts from Sotheby's, who were valuing the Hall's contents following the death of its owner, Sir John Gooch. \"It's a discovery of enormous significance,\" said Old Master specialist Richard Charlton-Jones. \"It's one of only seven or eight independent panel paintings by Cimabue that survive, and the only one in private hands. It's a picture of the greatest rarity and beauty.\" The painting, which measures only ten inches by eight, will go under the hammer in July, when it is estimated it will fetch in excess of \u00a32m. Whilst art experts are licking their lips, however, reaction amongst local villagers has been slightly more muted. \"I thought a Cimabue was like a sort of gerbil,\" commented one Southwold resident. \"When I heard they'd found one up at the hall I said they'd better call Rentokil.\" <b>East Anglian Daily Times</b> <p><b> Monk flunk </b><br> It's been a week of mixed fortunes for Magnificent Men and their Flying Machines.

Not such good news from Malmesbury, though, where plans to re-enact one of the earliest recorded instances of human flight have been scuppered because of high insurance premiums and complaints from English Heritage. Almost 1000 years ago, in 1010 AD, a Benedictine monk named Eilmer attached a pair of home-made wings to his arms and leapt from the tower of Malmesbury Abbey, gliding for some 660 feet before crashing to earth and breaking both his legs. His feat, which entered the history books as the first known example of an Englishman flying, was re-enacted in 1962 and 1976 with the help of a safety wire. Plans to do so again this year as part of Malmesbury's millennium celebrations have been dashed because of the huge cost of insuring the stunt, and concerns by English Heritage that it might damage the Abbey's exterior. Eilmer enthusiasts are now exploring the possibility of using a dummy to re-create their hero's flight, or even a hologram. \"You can get a sex-change on the National Health,\" complained one man, \"But you can't dress up as a monk and jump off a tower with wings on your arms.

The first reported incident occurred at the beginning of February, when a 2ft high concrete trough with moulded pig-snouts along the side disappeared from a garden on the Isle of Axholme. Since then, barely a night has gone by without at least one more trough disappearing, including one from a house in Crowle that weighed the best part of half a ton.

      "bodyText": "The Science Museum in London is in 'crisis talks' with the government over funding, with fears that either free admission for all, some of the expanding museum's facilities, or jobs will have to be sacrificed to meet a cash shortfall. The museum administration declined to comment yesterday for fear of jeopardising delicate negotiations with the culture minister, Chris Smith, and his civil servants. But one source close to the museum told the Guardian that, based on the government's initial grant offer for the next financial year, the institution would face a \u00a34 million shortfall - even if it kept charging adults, as it does now. There are concerns that redundancies might be the only way to bridge the gap, although no plans for cuts are thought to have been drawn up yet. There was anger that the government was holding back on support for the Science Museum, the national repository of the country's scientific heritage, when it could afford a \u00a332 million loan for the ailing Dome, the source said. The museum trustees have refused to fix a budget for 2000-01 on the basis of the government's initial proposals, complaining of a lack of clarity over Mr Smith's intentions on free admission. 'There are crisis talks going on with the government literally daily, trying to sort this out,' said another source, adding that the stumbling block was less free admission than grants for the running costs of a huge new extension to the museum due to be unveiled on June 27. The \u00a350 million Wellcome Wing, built with cash from the Wellcome Foundation and the Heritage Lottery Fund, will increase the museum's public space by almost a third and include an IMAX cinema. One plan had been to use the new attraction as justification to increase the admission charge for adults to \u00a38.50 from \u00a36.90. The trustees would rather scrap the entrance fee altogether, as the government wants - but it is not clear where the money is going to come from. A spokesman for the department of culture, media and sport said that talks were under way involving all museums, not just the Science Museum. The minister would make an announcement about 'further steps to increase free access to museums' before the end of March, he said. But nothing could be settled until the government had agreed with Customs and Excise on museums' VAT status. After that, it would be up to the museums themselves to decide whether they wanted to charge admission or not. 'We can't compel them to scrap admission charges,' the spokesman said.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>There is a widely held view that if Jude Law had been born in America, he would be where Matt Damon is now - a box office name you don't have to fish about in your memory to recognise. He is cut, after all, in the Hitler Youth mould of the American male lead: firm tits, stone jaw and the sort of petulant screen charm that flushes away disapproval with sheer gut fascination.</p> <p>It is easy to watch him in his role as Dickie Greenleaf, the arrogant playboy in The Talented Mr Ripley for which he has just won an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor, and imagine that it is an exaggerated version of himself - charming, beautiful, imperially conceited. But at six o'clock on a Wednesday evening, standing in a puddle two miles from Berlin, it is a vision that is hard to sustain. </p> <p>\"Raff, Raff, don't get in a tizz.\" He is consoling his two year old son Rafferty, who is screaming at the thought of travelling into town in a different car from daddy. Law has been out here, in Berlin's abandoned Russian army barracks, filming scenes for Enemy at the Gates. \"Don't cry, bubba,\" he says, picking the boy up and offering him a fistful of comics. \"Daddy's following right behind you.\" </p> <p>The boy, angel-haired like a fresco cherub, is momentarily distracted by a platoon of extras marching past in the direction of Red Square, a to-scale reconstruction built on waste ground. It's here that Law and Joseph Fiennes are daily playing Russian soldiers in Jean-Jacques Annaud's new film which is set during the battle of Stalingrad in the second world war. The film, which also stars Ed Harris and Rachel Weisz, is the true story of a duel between a Russian sniper and German officer. </p> <p>It is dark now, wet from the snow machine and about minus five degrees. The SS men have retired to their trailers and two German drivers, waiting to take us back to the city centre, are shooting air guns at each other and shivering at the weirdness of the scene before them. \"There are black shirts - SS men - marching about,\" says one. \"It is very strange, very strange to see.\" </p> <p>It couldn't be further from the scenes that Law, from next Friday, can be seen enjoying in The Talented Mr Ripley, the Anthony Minghella film that so meticulously recreates 1950s Italy that with every shot you expect Audrey Hepburn to come scooting round the corner, Tony Curtis in pursuit. \"I was hugely seduced by the era,\" says Law, when Rafferty, whose mother is the actress Sadie Frost, has agreed to go in the car with his grandparents. </p> <p>Law's voice is hoarse from shouting at SS men and he has a little moan about doing interviews after a long day's shooting. It is only a lapse in his charm, however. He takes talking seriously. \"Before the film, my image of the 50s came out of the Levi's ad. But it was an era of naive rebellion, when young people started expressing new found philosophies about having a good time, without using the shock tactics that came with the 60s.\" </p> <p>Law's character in the film, the son of an American shipping magnate living in louche style on the Italian coast, shocks in the same way that Gatsby did: by showing how bad behaviour is excused, and by extension enabled, by beauty. Dickie Greenleaf is loved, hated and indulged in equal measure because he is the person who everyone wants to be. \"I don't judge the characters I play,\" says Law. He is interesting on Greenleaf, since his public profile shares some of his characteristics. \"When I first read the part I did what I think it is natural in Britain to do: I recoiled from him as this spoilt, golden boy. But Anthony won me over. I am fascinated by the challenge of trying to make nasty characters likeable and vice versa, because everyone is made up of all those facets.\" </p> <p>Law's initial dismay at the part may also have come from the fact that he dies half way through the film. \"Before I went through it with Anthony, I hadn't seen how the part of Dickie resonates throughout the whole film. But he is always there, in a sense.\" This sounds a bit like the school teacher trying to persuade little Johnny that the donkey really is a pivotal part in the nativity play and every bit as important as Joseph - except that Law's performance is dazzling enough to do just as Minghella promised, and keep the audience thinking about him throughout the film. It brings home that while his roles in the science fiction films Gattaca and eXistenZ were played with conviction, this is the first time Law has really looked like a star. </p> <p>The irony is that in terms of his background, the 27 year old really has more in common with the Matt Damon role, Tom Ripley, the ordinary Joe with the talent for mimicry. Law's parents are both retired teachers from South London and he was educated at a comprehensive school before the bullying got too bad and he was transfered to a private one in Dulwich. \"We have all been in positions where we've been Tom Ripley - where we've hated ourselves and wanted to be someone else. But it was more interesting for me to play Greenleaf and to assume all these airs and graces, rather than to draw on my own demons.\" </p> <p>Admittedly, his demons aren't that ferocious. The tenor of his upbringing was such, says Law, that his confidence is mistaken for arrogance. He doesn't think he is better than anyone else, he just knows who he is and what he does best. </p> <p>\"I remember the first school play I did when I was six. It wasn't a case of me looking at the other kids and thinking that I was better. It was just that I immediately understood it, the concept of creating an imaginative scenario. I took it very seriously. I probably drove people mad.\" </p> <p>He was emboldened by the relationship he had with his parents - a very adult one that included going regularly to the theatre and talking about the plays they had seen. \"Perhaps that's what made me seem cocky at school. But I always assumed that I would get what I wanted in terms of my acting. Not that I was going to be a star or anything, but I didn't see why I should do that British thing of playing down my ambitions. 'You can't be an actor,' they said to me at school. 'Why not?' I said. It's a clich\u00e9, but that's how it was.\" </p> <p>Confidence is in his make-up, he says, and so is thoughtfulness. \"I have always been someone who can't do something that I know will hurt others. Whether success will breed arrogance I don't know, but I'll never deny what I can do and I'll never knowingly upset someone.\" </p> <p>The success of his school plays encouraged him to join the National Youth Theatre where, at 13 years old, he met Jonny Lee Miller, now one of his best friends and a partner in Natural Nylon, the production company they own with Sean Pertwee and Ewan McGregor. At 16, he left school with his parents' blessing and won a small part in the Granada soap, Families, before getting a breakthrough role in Les Parents Terribles. When it transferred from the National Theatre to New York, Law won a Tony nomination for best supporting actor and the film roles followed. </p> <p>\"The plan was always to go to university and train to be an actor after that,\" he says. \"But I didn't enjoy the institution of school. I like the accumulated knowledge and the minds of good teachers, but I hated rules and regulations. It's the same on set. If you're not having a good time, why are you standing there doing it? It's your life.\" </p> <p>He loves to tackle a thick reading list before starting a new project. On eXistenZ, a film about a virtual reality game, the director David Cronenberg had Law reading Dostoevsky and Kierkegaard as well as putting in some essential hours playing Tomb Raider. For Enemy at the Gates he is ploughing through Russian history books. </p> <p>His parents have flown out with Rafferty to congratulate him on the Oscar nomination, something he is \"thrilled\" about naturally, and has been keeping his mind off as a grace too many to wish for. Harvey Weinstein, the co-chairman of Miramax, is thrilled also and we have to stop on the way to the set to buy Law a bottle of Dom Perignon in Weinstein's name. </p> <p>He won't be seduced into moving to the States with the movie movers and shakers, however, and has Rafferty enrolled in a state school in north London, where he and Sadie intend to stay. He is not the kind of movie dad who disappears for nine months at a time. As on set, he knows his own value at home. \"There's no need to go to Hollywood. I have all my friends around and I know how it feels to be a kid growing up here. Besides, meetings can be held in London.\" Modest, see?</p> <p>\u0095 The Talented Mr Ripley opens on February 25.</p>",

But scooping the jackpot is Hollinger Telegraph New Media, a sister company of the Telegraph newspaper, whose \u00a35m investment 15 months ago (topped up by loans last year) is now worth \u00a3156m.</p> <p>The share offer was 26 times oversubscribed, with 82,000 small investors - a record for a UK internet float - applying for shares. But yesterday they bombarded the firm's chat rooms and bulletin boards with angry emails after allocations were scaled back to a flat 145 shares. By the end of yesterday's trading each parcel of shares was worth \u00a3485.75, a profit of just \u00a3268.25. For the 240 investors who applied for \u00a350,000 or more worth of shares the news was even worse - they will not receive any stake and their cheques will be returned to them.</p> <p>Many had expected windfalls of \u00a31,000-\u00a32,000 from the float. Small investors were particularly furious that 80% of the shares were set aside for institutional investors, even though the vast majority of applicants were the firm's own customers, who use the site to swap tips and information on hi-tech shares. Many threat ened to quit the site and switch to the firm's main rivals, Hemscott and Motley Fool.</p> <p>But Interactive Investor's chief executive, Tom Carruthers, said the proportion of shares set aside for retail investors was higher than in other net flotations. \"We believe this [20% allocation] is entirely appropriate and reinforces our ongoing commitment to our users. In addition, we believe this proportion is significantly higher than in previous internet IPOs in the UK.\"</p> <p>Interactive Investor has 389,000 registered users for its service, which allows individuals to identify, compare and monitor financial products. Around half of its \u00a32.6m revenues last year came from advertising and fees from product providers who obtain customers through the site. The other half came from consultancy fees from designing and building an online capability for other financial services providers.</p> <p>\"The market is valuing the company appropriately considering that we have the largest number of users and the longest running personal finance website in the UK,\" said Mr Carruthers, who holds a 3% stake in the company through option schemes.</p>",

The share offer was 26 times oversubscribed, with 82,000 small investors - a record for a UK internet float - applying for shares. But yesterday they bombarded the firm's chat rooms and bulletin boards with angry emails after allocations were scaled back to a flat 145 shares. By the end of yesterday's trading each parcel of shares was worth \u00a3485.75, a profit of just \u00a3268.25. For the 240 investors who applied for \u00a350,000 or more worth of shares the news was even worse - they will not receive any stake and their cheques will be returned to them. Many had expected windfalls of \u00a31,000-\u00a32,000 from the float. Small investors were particularly furious that 80% of the shares were set aside for institutional investors, even though the vast majority of applicants were the firm's own customers, who use the site to swap tips and information on hi-tech shares. Many threat ened to quit the site and switch to the firm's main rivals, Hemscott and Motley Fool. But Interactive Investor's chief executive, Tom Carruthers, said the proportion of shares set aside for retail investors was higher than in other net flotations. \"We believe this [20% allocation] is entirely appropriate and reinforces our ongoing commitment to our users. In addition, we believe this proportion is significantly higher than in previous internet IPOs in the UK.\" Interactive Investor has 389,000 registered users for its service, which allows individuals to identify, compare and monitor financial products. Around half of its \u00a32.6m revenues last year came from advertising and fees from product providers who obtain customers through the site. The other half came from consultancy fees from designing and building an online capability for other financial services providers. \"The market is valuing the company appropriately considering that we have the largest number of users and the longest running personal finance website in the UK,\" said Mr Carruthers, who holds a 3% stake in the company through option schemes.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>AN OLD STORY</strong></p> <p>\"Help the aged, please don't put them in a home!\" sang floppy-haired pop fop Jarvis Cocker from The Pulp. That's at least one person who'll be happy with the news that Newcastle United have given Bobby Robson, 67 today, a 12-month rolling contract with no expiry date. Although approximately 36,834 regulars at St James Park may be quite pleased as well.</p> <p>The generous contract rewards the Bobster for turning Newcastle from an inept laughing stock rooted to the bottom of the league into one of the sexiest outfits in the Premiership - no mean feat with a team that includes Duncan Ferguson and Nobby Solano. Newcastle's board issued a statement which explained how Bob has earned his reward - they're \"delighted with what Bobby has achieved in such a short period\".</p> <p>Gentlemanly words indeed. Until you read on. \"We look forward to working with him to bring us the success that the Newcastle supporters deserve,\" they continue, in the most blatant example of bandwagon jumping the Fiver has seen for years. Do you think they're after some of Bob's credit just in case the Toon win the FA Cup? Howay, the very thought!</p> <p><strong>WHERE ARE YOUR MANNERS?</strong></p> <p>Some poor bloke is having to haul himself out of bed on Sunday morning just to provide you with live minute-by-minute coverage of Leeds v Manchester United. He'll probably have a hangover as well. So the least you can do is follow every kick at http://www.footballunlimited.co.uk.</p> <p><strong>GET CELESTINE</strong></p> <p>Chelsea still haven't found Celestine Babayaro, who has gone AWOL since Nigeria were defeated by Cameroon in the final of the African Nations Cup. The Chelse have given his London pad a bell - no answer - and faxed the Nigerian FA in Lagos - no dice. So where is he?</p> <p>James Sanders thinks he might know his whereabouts: \"Celesline - as he calls himself, on account of not being able to cross a T, let alone a ball - is being kept away from Stamford Bridge by a group of deeply satisfied Chelsea supporters. Satisfied that is, with young Jon Harley.\"</p> <p>Rick doesn't agree. He thinks Stan Collymore may be the root of the problem, as he reckons Babs was last spotted in La Manga. By Rick's account, Celestine is \"now encased, mummy-like, in fire extinguisher foam\".</p> <p>And the improbably named Matthew Cock adds a bit of bull when he explains that, \"During one of his celebratory back-flips, Celestine momentarily escaped the earth's gravitational pull.\" It's unlikely, but thanks for that, Mr Cock.</p> <p>Other places Fiver readers have spotted Babayaro are: Manly beach in Sydney, Bangor High Street, the Duck &amp; Ferret, the Vatican, the Tesco cafe in Cambridge, the Andes, Goldigger's Nightclub in Cheltenham and \"down the back of the sofa\". Rather spookily, if you plot all these places on a map of the world and join the dots up, you get a picture of Ken Bates. The mystery deepens...</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"I haven't had a good Saturday night since we beat Tottenham in December. When you win, you know you can go out and enjoy yourself. I haven't been going out on Saturday nights.\" - Poor Bryan Robson, who must be gasping for a Middlesbrough victory.</p> <p><strong>KEEP UP WITH THE CUP</strong></p> <p>This week's biggest game is in the Premiership. But seeing as Manchester United ignored the FA Cup, we're going to ignore them. So quarter-final weekend it is. Mind you, come Sunday morning, we'll be tuned in to events at Elland Road like everyone else - but don't tell anyone or we'll sound like hypocrites.</p> <p>Bolton v Charlton (Saturday) Bolton's Ricardo Gardner and Mark Fish are back from international duty, and Mike Whitlow and Dean Holden return from suspension. Mark Kinsella is back for Charlton, which should make up for the enforced absence of recent signing Mathias Svensson, who is cup-tied. This match guarantees a Nationwide presence in the semi-finals, so please note how we have treated the tie with the gravitas it warrants. [Nice excuse - Fiver ed.]</p> <p>Chelsea v Gillingham (Sunday) Seeing that Celestine Babayaro is gadding around somewhere, Jon Harley continues to deputise. He may be the only defender in Chelsea's team, as Frank Leboeuf is suspended, Emerson Thome is cup-tied and Graeme Le Saux, Jes Hogh and Albert Ferrer are all knackered. Hilarity awaits! Meanwhile, Gills striker Carl Asaba may be on the bench after a long-term hernia injury, while Adrian Pennock and Mark Saunders are expected to ignore slight knocks just so they can be patronised by pundits and papers alike.</p> <p>Everton v Aston Villa (Sunday) Enckelman. He sounds a pan-European long-haired lounge singer from the Sixties. But he's not. He's a Finnish Under-21 international goalkeeper called Peter, and he may replace Villa's hapless flapper David James, who has a thigh strain. Meanwhile, Gustavo Bartelt, on loan from Roma, may make his first start in a Villa shirt. The home side welcome back David Unsworth - well someone has to be glad to see him.</p> <p>Tranmere v Newcastle (Sunday) Talented young Irishman Alan Mahon may not make the game after picking up a bit of ankle-knack against Wolves. David Kelly, Graham Allen, Gary Jones and Gareth Roberts all return, but Clint Hill, Steve Yates and Wayne Allison are missing for one reason or another - injuries, being cup-tied, you know the sort of thing. Shock news for the Toon - Duncan Ferguson is injured!</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Everton are interested in Numancia midfielder Txomin Nagore, according to Opta Soccer. However, Nagore is likely to rejoin Numancia's parent club, Athletic Bilbao.</p> <p>Newcastle are interested in Lens midfielder Olivier Dacourt.</p> <p>Southampton are now favourites to sign Rangers defender Colin Hendry.</p> <p><strong>NEWS IN BRIEF</strong></p> <p>Four members of the Newcastle youth academy have been involved in a serious car crash. Kevin Wealleans, 18, is critically ill with serious internal injuries after the car he was driving hit another vehicle after crossing the central reservation on the A189 near Cramlington, Northumberland.

      "bodyText": "AN OLD STORY \"Help the aged, please don't put them in a home!\" sang floppy-haired pop fop Jarvis Cocker from The Pulp. That's at least one person who'll be happy with the news that Newcastle United have given Bobby Robson, 67 today, a 12-month rolling contract with no expiry date. Although approximately 36,834 regulars at St James Park may be quite pleased as well. The generous contract rewards the Bobster for turning Newcastle from an inept laughing stock rooted to the bottom of the league into one of the sexiest outfits in the Premiership - no mean feat with a team that includes Duncan Ferguson and Nobby Solano. Newcastle's board issued a statement which explained how Bob has earned his reward - they're \"delighted with what Bobby has achieved in such a short period\". Gentlemanly words indeed. Until you read on. \"We look forward to working with him to bring us the success that the Newcastle supporters deserve,\" they continue, in the most blatant example of bandwagon jumping the Fiver has seen for years. Do you think they're after some of Bob's credit just in case the Toon win the FA Cup? Howay, the very thought! WHERE ARE YOUR MANNERS? Some poor bloke is having to haul himself out of bed on Sunday morning just to provide you with live minute-by-minute coverage of Leeds v Manchester United. He'll probably have a hangover as well. So the least you can do is follow every kick at http://www.footballunlimited.co.uk. GET CELESTINE Chelsea still haven't found Celestine Babayaro, who has gone AWOL since Nigeria were defeated by Cameroon in the final of the African Nations Cup. The Chelse have given his London pad a bell - no answer - and faxed the Nigerian FA in Lagos - no dice. So where is he? James Sanders thinks he might know his whereabouts: \"Celesline - as he calls himself, on account of not being able to cross a T, let alone a ball - is being kept away from Stamford Bridge by a group of deeply satisfied Chelsea supporters. Satisfied that is, with young Jon Harley.\" Rick doesn't agree. He thinks Stan Collymore may be the root of the problem, as he reckons Babs was last spotted in La Manga. By Rick's account, Celestine is \"now encased, mummy-like, in fire extinguisher foam\". And the improbably named Matthew Cock adds a bit of bull when he explains that, \"During one of his celebratory back-flips, Celestine momentarily escaped the earth's gravitational pull.\" It's unlikely, but thanks for that, Mr Cock. Other places Fiver readers have spotted Babayaro are: Manly beach in Sydney, Bangor High Street, the Duck &amp; Ferret, the Vatican, the Tesco cafe in Cambridge, the Andes, Goldigger's Nightclub in Cheltenham and \"down the back of the sofa\". Rather spookily, if you plot all these places on a map of the world and join the dots up, you get a picture of Ken Bates. The mystery deepens... QUOTE OF THE DAY \"I haven't had a good Saturday night since we beat Tottenham in December. When you win, you know you can go out and enjoy yourself. I haven't been going out on Saturday nights.\" - Poor Bryan Robson, who must be gasping for a Middlesbrough victory. KEEP UP WITH THE CUP This week's biggest game is in the Premiership. But seeing as Manchester United ignored the FA Cup, we're going to ignore them. So quarter-final weekend it is. Mind you, come Sunday morning, we'll be tuned in to events at Elland Road like everyone else - but don't tell anyone or we'll sound like hypocrites. Bolton v Charlton (Saturday) Bolton's Ricardo Gardner and Mark Fish are back from international duty, and Mike Whitlow and Dean Holden return from suspension. Mark Kinsella is back for Charlton, which should make up for the enforced absence of recent signing Mathias Svensson, who is cup-tied. This match guarantees a Nationwide presence in the semi-finals, so please note how we have treated the tie with the gravitas it warrants. [Nice excuse - Fiver ed.] Chelsea v Gillingham (Sunday) Seeing that Celestine Babayaro is gadding around somewhere, Jon Harley continues to deputise. He may be the only defender in Chelsea's team, as Frank Leboeuf is suspended, Emerson Thome is cup-tied and Graeme Le Saux, Jes Hogh and Albert Ferrer are all knackered. Hilarity awaits! Meanwhile, Gills striker Carl Asaba may be on the bench after a long-term hernia injury, while Adrian Pennock and Mark Saunders are expected to ignore slight knocks just so they can be patronised by pundits and papers alike. Everton v Aston Villa (Sunday) Enckelman. He sounds a pan-European long-haired lounge singer from the Sixties. But he's not. He's a Finnish Under-21 international goalkeeper called Peter, and he may replace Villa's hapless flapper David James, who has a thigh strain. Meanwhile, Gustavo Bartelt, on loan from Roma, may make his first start in a Villa shirt. The home side welcome back David Unsworth - well someone has to be glad to see him. Tranmere v Newcastle (Sunday) Talented young Irishman Alan Mahon may not make the game after picking up a bit of ankle-knack against Wolves. David Kelly, Graham Allen, Gary Jones and Gareth Roberts all return, but Clint Hill, Steve Yates and Wayne Allison are missing for one reason or another - injuries, being cup-tied, you know the sort of thing. Shock news for the Toon - Duncan Ferguson is injured! THE RUMOUR MILL Everton are interested in Numancia midfielder Txomin Nagore, according to Opta Soccer. However, Nagore is likely to rejoin Numancia's parent club, Athletic Bilbao. Newcastle are interested in Lens midfielder Olivier Dacourt. Southampton are now favourites to sign Rangers defender Colin Hendry. NEWS IN BRIEF Four members of the Newcastle youth academy have been involved in a serious car crash. Kevin Wealleans, 18, is critically ill with serious internal injuries after the car he was driving hit another vehicle after crossing the central reservation on the A189 near Cramlington, Northumberland. Ryan Hogg, 17, and Paul Dunn, 17, were also admitted to hospital in Ashington but were described as being in a stable condition. A fourth player, Jonathan Mann, 17, was released from hospital after being treated for minor head wounds. Dundee United manager Paul Sturrock today confirmed he is staying at Tannadice. Sturrock hinted he was thinking of resigning after the CIS Cup semi-final defeat by Aberdeen but has changed his mind. He said: \"On Sunday I was ready to go. But I feel we have committed ourselves to young players and others and it would be unfair to walk out on them and the fans who have been supportive.\" Jorge Cadete has said goodbye to his Benfica team-mates and will fly in to complete his switch to Bradford early next week. Chelsea, West Ham, Aston Villa and Middlesbrough have all put their names down as prospective entrants for this summer's Intertoto Cup. Lou Macari has brought a wrongful dismissal claim against Stoke nearly three years after his resignation. Stoke are \"vigorously defending\" the claim. The German Soccer Federation has announced that the World Cup 2002 qualifier between Germany and England on September 1 2001 will be played in Munich's Olympic Stadium. Argentina squad to face England: Goalkeepers: German Burgos (Real Mallorca), Pablo Cavallero (Espanyol).

      "body": "<p>\"How did you become a fashion editor?\" is a question I am asked more than is seemly. What they really mean is: what on God's earth qualifies me to comment on clothes and suggest what people should wear? Good dress sense? A keen eye? An art school education? A way with words? A brass neck? I don't know. Maybe I should have been a teacher. </p> <p>All fashion folk are scared of being divulged as frauds and never more so than during London Fashion Week. London throws up so much diverse talent, with such enthusiasm, that it's easy to get carried away and start proclaiming a sow's ear is a silk purse. This is why you hear loud and purposeful remarks such as: \"I hated them last season but I love them now.\" Or: \"Truly cerebral, though the Prada referencing was a bit heavy.\" Everyone tries to convince everyone else they know what they're talking about. </p> <p>It was an exciting season, or \"vintage London\", as one buyer remarked. We laughed, we cried, we clapped tremendously. Hurrah! The British Fashion Council had invited some lesser-known designers on to the official schedule and the five days were all the more lively for this. Boudicca's folded, draped, military-inspired vision came to Kensington's West Lawn tent for the first time, proving that the avant-garde doesn't turn into a pumpkin when it leaves EC1. Round the corner in a scout hall was Dai Rees, who showed neutral heavy knits with outsize cable details, stiff tweed skirts with embossed panels and dramatic leather millinery. </p> <p>A short taxi ride away was Marcus Constable, who put out an incredibly slick collection, given that this was his first show. The invitations were library tickets, the inspiration sexually frustrated librarians. Long-haired models in knee-length boots, bottle-green culottes and buttoned-up blouses sashayed down the carpet. Long pleated belts made from fake hair were an imaginative touch. </p> <p>\"Daddy, who were The Clash?\" said the ticket to Luella's show, setting the scene far better than a page-long press release about \"the raw energy of the peasant folk of Bali\" ever could. Luella managed something very rare indeed: she sent out a collection that was different and exciting. Black V-necks, white Aertex shirts and black pencil skirts shot through with Lurex thread looked not just mod but modern. Of course, \"mod\" always did mean modern, but who'd have thought a movement that started in the 60s could look so right for now? The ultra-tidy, scruffy-round-the-edges mod/punk aesthetic is the only one that hasn't been plundered recently: those who say Milan is where trends start should watch this space and see if the Italians follow Luella's lead. Maybe, in a few years' time. </p> <p>Shelley Fox put on a great show: it began with four men spinning plates and ended with distressed sequin dresses in burnished copper and brown. To the heart-rending strains of Are You Lonesome Tonight, Fox had her cunning way with geometric shapes and clever detailing, in felted wool dresses, the skirts multi-layered, the bodices cascading with bunched-up petals. Brown leather coats with tie belts and narrow shoulders looked supple and sharp. </p> <p>Jasper Conran and Betty Jackson are positively old-skool compared with new designers like Luella, Constable and Fox. One wonders how many of the young guns will still be around next decade. It's a tough old world. Conran had a bit of an Yves moment, with mannish pinstripe suits, stiff white shirts and black ties tucked into trouser waistbands. There was also an abundance of leather nappa: floor-sweeping white coats and black full-skirted halterneck dresses looked light and sensuous. </p> <p>Jackson was also nappa-happy: red was her colour of choice for wide-sleeved leather blouson jackets with pussy bows, soft calf-length boots which wrinkled at the ankle and thick belts with heavy buckles. With a nod to the 80s, she put out iridescent halterneck dresses and tight jeans with a paint-splatter print. </p> <p>Alexander McQueen went all tribal for autumn/winter: African head-dresses, thick wooden bangles and heavy astrakhan or rabbit skin combined with giant chunky knits and horsehair in a raw, vicious collection full of rich, contrasting textures. This was a lion of a show - possibly too savage at times, unless you have a penchant for long silver spikes that hold your lips back in a perpetual snarl. My favourite was a beaded dress with a swishing horsehair skirt, though it's the bumster jeans, three-quarter-length frock coats and wide-legged grey trousers that will actually make it into Harvey Nicks, more's the pity. </p> <p> What's the opposite of McQueen? Clements Ribeiro. They never frighten the horses and they certainly wouldn't use horsehair. You wouldn't be arrested in CR, but you might be wolf-whistled. This season's collection had a disco feel, with fantastic glitter shoes and boots, chiffon skirts with glittery flowers stencilled on top and rainbow-striped Lurex jumpers. Camel coats with voluminous sleeves and thin tie belts provided neutral contrasts. These are designers with a great sense of colour: too much is never enough. </p> <p>Like Clements Ribeiro, Tracey Boyd's show was sponsored by Top Shop. Both do lines for the mammoth high street chain: now it was payback time. Boyd's show was a mixed bag, but cherry red corduroy trenchcoats, peach Lurex sweater dresses and cord A-line skirts stood out - as did the cashmere knits. Respect to Boyd for the Top Shop link-up, which shows sound business sense. As does Elspeth Gibson, whose range of toiletries, alongside her Sweetpea range of childrenswear for Debenhams, is a clever diversification. In what was one of Gibson's more commercially risky shows, burgundy velvet pantaloons were combined with purple cashmere jumpers, while lacy tops were paired with soft tweed pencil skirts and matching fedoras. </p> <p>A world apart from all of this, though, is Hussein Chalayan: a magician and a genius. He turns chairs into dresses and tables into skirts. He builds clothes like an architect builds houses, mindful of all their corners. Let's put it plainly, in cabbie-speak: \"There were these four chairs, right, on this stage, and they just sat there like props throughout the show, until at the end, these four birds started unfastening the covers and putting them on. Then - I'm telling you - the chair legs and bases folded up into wooden suitcases!\" </p> <p>In addition to the furniture alchemy, there were stiff black suits with corrugated collars, their borders trimmed with thin white piping; beige shearling coats with mitten-shaped pockets and red bell-shaped, box-pleated corduroy skirts worn with floral-sprigged blouses which swung off the body. It was an amazing show: as complete, controlled and perfect as a Shakespearean sonnet. </p> <p>I'm sorry there isn't enough room to review everyone. This week made me proud to be British. British designers - so little money, but so much style.</p>",

A world apart from all of this, though, is Hussein Chalayan: a magician and a genius. He turns chairs into dresses and tables into skirts. He builds clothes like an architect builds houses, mindful of all their corners. Let's put it plainly, in cabbie-speak: \"There were these four chairs, right, on this stage, and they just sat there like props throughout the show, until at the end, these four birds started unfastening the covers and putting them on. Then - I'm telling you - the chair legs and bases folded up into wooden suitcases!\" In addition to the furniture alchemy, there were stiff black suits with corrugated collars, their borders trimmed with thin white piping; beige shearling coats with mitten-shaped pockets and red bell-shaped, box-pleated corduroy skirts worn with floral-sprigged blouses which swung off the body. It was an amazing show: as complete, controlled and perfect as a Shakespearean sonnet. I'm sorry there isn't enough room to review everyone. This week made me proud to be British. British designers - so little money, but so much style.",

There's the season that's just beginning, but for which the shows took place six months ago (spring/summer 2000) - hotpants, pussycat bows and snakeskin. And there's the season at which the clothes now on the catwalks are aimed (autumn/winter 2000/2001) - which looks set to be about leather, fur, sexy boots and looking grown-up.

Husband and wife team Richard and Lili Zanuck had hoped to lure the stars for the gong-fest to add a little extra sparkle to the show, but as they haven't been nominated for anything this year the Hollywood hunks are refusing to attend. A miffed Richard Zanuck says, \"It's disturbing that stars who are neither nominated nor presenters don't show up. The show is what we do and we celebrate movies at the Oscars in an entertaining way.

All involved in the project are still reading scripts for the parts, but it's believed that Aziz - now frontman in his own band - will play a gangland drugs boss. Shaun Ryder, who previously starred opposite Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman in the flop that was The Avengers, is also up for a major part, but according to a friend of the singer he's having a few problems with the script. Not with his character's motivation, just with his own. Says his friend, \"Shaun's definitely up for a part in the film, he just needs to read the script.

      "bodyText": "In Britain, as on the continent, sleaze became a political issue in the 1990s. Indeed, it is widely thought to have been one of the factors responsible for the downfall of John Major's government. Three senior Conservative politicians, the cabinet minister Jonathan Aitken, and the junior ministers Neil Hamilton and Tim Smith, were found guilty of serious financial improprieties, and their political careers ended as a result. In 1994, following allegations that two Conservative backbenchers, David Tredinnick and Graham Riddick, had accepted money for asking parliamentary questions, public disquiet led to the formation of a standing committee on standards in public life. Yet from a continental perspective, these scandals must appear almost inconsequential. British sleaze has on the whole been confined to those not in the political front rank. Moreover, sleaze in Britain, since the days of Lloyd George, has never involved senior government ministers, much less heads of government. There has been nothing like the massive money laundering and misuse of patronage of which Helmut Kohl, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and Bettino Craxi have been accused. So why are we so comparatively free of sleaze? Britain is often seen as a political system dominated by the party. Yet in truth, party patronage pays a much smaller role here than it does on the continent. In Italy the \"southernisation\" of the civil service resulted in 350,000 people being recruited through patronage between 1973 and 1990, as compared with 250,000 recruited by a competitive examination. In Austria - an extreme example - public posts, including teaching appointments, have long been divided among the two main parties, the Social Democrats and the People's party. Indeed, popular resentment of this practice was one of the main factors responsible for J\u00f6rg Haider's rise to power. In Britain, by contrast, there is a firm line demar cating political authority, derived from success in competitive elections, from administrative authority, derived from success in competitive examinations. The civil service remains a career service, founded on the values of political neutrality and impartiality. Special advisers - who comprise about 70 of the 2,500 senior civil servants - have no executive authority; while appointments to quangos, which are by and large semi-official bodies without executive powers, are generally short-term. As a result, political parties can do little to reward their supporters; a seat in the House of Lords or an honour is perhaps the most that can be offered. Tony Blair, however, is divesting himself of patronage in the House of Lords by placing the nomination of cross-bench peers into the hands of an independent appointments committee. The proposals of the committee on standards in public life, currently the subject of legislation to introduce greater transparency in party funding, are also likely to limit the scope of patronage. Sunlight, said the US supreme court justice Louis Dembitz Brandeis, is the best disinfectant. With much to teach our counterparts on the continent, how sad it is that successive Eurosceptic governments have weakened our regional prestige.

Last month a Milan court overturned a jail term for false accounting, but he still faces other charges of false accounting and bribing tax inspectors. Rory Carroll, Rome",

Why all this high-level nuclear waste? Nuclear waste remains dangerous for around 250,000 years Can you do anything about it? Turn it into glass blocks and cool it for 50 years and then store it deep underground for at least 200,000 years.

      "bodyText": "Europe's leaders yesterday began trying to rebuild faith in the continent's political institutions, battered by the biggest spate of scandals since the second world war. Still in shock from the worst of them, Germany's Christian Democrats (CDU) launched a search for a new leader untainted by the \u00a314m slush fund scandal that threatens to destroy the party in the polls. In Brussels the European commission confirmed that its reform white paper will be launched on March 1. Tony Blair is likely to discuss reform when he meets the commission president, Romano Prodi, in Brussels next week. The devastating revelations in Germany follow a series of financial scandals that have rocked political parties in France, Italy, Russia and many other continental countries. Although the scandals are not related, a trend is emerging across Europe of irregularities in party funding that are damaging the reputations of the continent's political leadership. Neil Kinnock, the European commission vice-president given responsibility last September for reform of the body, said last night: \"Britain has taken its major steps to deal with the issue of standards in public life in recent years, with the Nolan and Neill committees. Other European countries are also dealing with it.\" He added: \"In the commission reform strategy I have proposed a European committee of standards in public life to ensure that the European public can have fresh confidence in all of the situations of the European Union. \"It wouldn't guarantee perfection. It would help to promote probity everywhere.\" Leading conservatives in Germany urged the CDU to take its time choosing a successor to Wolfgang Scha\u00fcble, who stood down on Wednesday. The refusal of the former chancellor and long-time CDU leader Helmut Kohl to say who gave him the money has tarnished his reputation as a European statesman. In a separate scandal, Edith Cresson, a former French prime minister, is to be questioned by Belgian police over corruption allegations. EU insiders say the commission's decision to strip Mrs Cresson of diplomatic immunity underlines what is at stake. \"If the issue goes off the boil, then resistance to the proposed reforms could get stronger,\" an official warned. \"There is massive political pressure for the commission to change. Publicity helps.\" Mrs Cresson, a former European commissioner, has denied any wrongdoing. France has also seen scandals involving tainted blood, the former finance minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn and the former foreign minister Roland Dumas. One of the keystones of Mr Kinnock's reform package is an inter-institutional committee on standards in public life - designed to ensure that the commission, the EU council of ministers and the European parliament all live up to the sort of criteria laid down by the Nolan commission on public standards in Britain. Mr Kinnock said: \"Obviously, dirt in public life is despicable anywhere - but there's no 'country of origin' stamp on it. The essential requirement is to combat sleaze so effectively that it is deterred.\" Some MEPs fiercely resist attempts to look at their generous expenses and allowances. The EU's anti-fraud office, Olaf, now has operational independence, but there are still concerns in Strasbourg about it becoming too powerful a watchdog.

A win may be a win, but this was a poor effort by England. </p> <p>Amid all the excitement it was easy to forget the outstanding contribution of man of the match Craig White, who followed figures of 5-21 with a crucial 26. White's best day in an England shirt began when he got rid of Zimbabwe\u00d5s danger man, Neil Johnson, for 30, caught at midwicket by the ubiquitous Nasser Hussain to leave Zimbabwe 60 for 2 (Alistair Campbell had already perished, caught by Graeme Hick in the gully off Andy Caddick for 6). White, helped by a fruity pitch, proceeded to cut a swathe through Zimbabwe\u00d5s fragile middle order.</p> <p>Stuart Carlisle was his second victim, caught behind for 31 as he tried to cut a ball that was too close to him (76 for 3), and White then dismissed both the Flower brothers in the space of four runs: Andy edged a ball that left him and was spectacularly held by Chris Read for 3, diving high to his left to cling on one-handed (80 for 4), before Grant was bowled for 2 by one that nipped back (84 for 5).</p> <p>White then claimed his first five-wicket haul in ODIs by having Dirk Viljoen caught behind for a 20-ball 2, and Zimbabwe were in desperate trouble at 98 for 6. It was soon 98 for 7 when Murray Goodwin pulled Mullally straight to Hick at square-leg, and, although the tail resisted for a while, Zimbabwe were eventually dismissed for 131 with three balls of their 48 overs remaining, Ealham finishing the job by bowling Gary Brent (10) and Henry Olonga (0) with successive deliveries.</p> <p>A total of 132, even on this pudding of a pitch, should not have stretched England. But when has that ever stopped them making a hash of things? They lost Nick Knight for 0, given out caught behind off Heath Streak in the first over (although replays suggested he the noise may have been bat against pad), and Nasser Hussain, leg before to Streak for 2 as he pushed forward. That made it 6 for 2, and suddenly 132 was looking a mile away.</p> <p>Graeme Hick and Darren Maddy took the score to 30, before Hick perished to a needless pull at a delivery from Streak that was too full and top-edged a simple catch to Andy Flower behind the stumps for 13. The required run-rate (2.75 at the start of the innings) seemed to pass England by, and Maddy followed, pulling Gary Brent straight to Henry Olonga at deep backward square-leg for 13 to leave England 58 for 4. Where calm heads were required England were playing as if they needed 300. </p> <p> Vikram Solanki played another innings that summed up his embryonic international career so far: studded with shots that revealed a rare talent (such as the rasping, wristy pull for four off Brent), it again came to a self-induced end as he tried to sweep Grant Flower and got a top edge to Streak, running back at square-leg. His innings of 24 may have been his best effort yet for England, but they needed him to go on. Now they were in trouble at 73 for 5.</p> <p>But White and Ealham began to turn things round, with Ealham slog-sweeping Viljoen's left-arm spin for six, and White driving Streak through the covers for four the ball after England's hundred had come up. </p> <p>England were doing it easily, and required just 12 more with plenty of overs to spare, when things began to go horribly wrong. White slashed Olonga straight to Goodwin in the covers for 26 (120 for 6), before Chris Read, impatient after failing to score from his first 10 balls, pulled his 11th, from Brent, tamely to Craig Wishart, the substitute fielder at square-leg. England were 124 for 7, yet remained favourites. But Ealham then went lbw, playing around a slower ball from Brent for 32 (125 for 8), and Caddick followed almost immediately, bowled off stump for 0 by Viljoen as he advanced down the wicket. It was unbelievably dense cricket: from nowhere England had lost four wickets for five runs and had turned sure-fire victory into potential defeat. </p> <p>But Gough worked Brent fine on the legside for four, and, from the final ball of the next over, Mullally took a single to keep the strike. Two to win, one to tie. Two balls later, Mullally edged Brent to third man for four, and England had crept ignominiously to victory. Never before has a total of 131 looked so forbidding.</p> <p> <em>Lawrence Booth is assistant editor of wisden.com</em></p>",

It was soon 98 for 7 when Murray Goodwin pulled Mullally straight to Hick at square-leg, and, although the tail resisted for a while, Zimbabwe were eventually dismissed for 131 with three balls of their 48 overs remaining, Ealham finishing the job by bowling Gary Brent (10) and Henry Olonga (0) with successive deliveries. A total of 132, even on this pudding of a pitch, should not have stretched England. But when has that ever stopped them making a hash of things? They lost Nick Knight for 0, given out caught behind off Heath Streak in the first over (although replays suggested he the noise may have been bat against pad), and Nasser Hussain, leg before to Streak for 2 as he pushed forward. That made it 6 for 2, and suddenly 132 was looking a mile away. Graeme Hick and Darren Maddy took the score to 30, before Hick perished to a needless pull at a delivery from Streak that was too full and top-edged a simple catch to Andy Flower behind the stumps for 13. The required run-rate (2.75 at the start of the innings) seemed to pass England by, and Maddy followed, pulling Gary Brent straight to Henry Olonga at deep backward square-leg for 13 to leave England 58 for 4. Where calm heads were required England were playing as if they needed 300. Vikram Solanki played another innings that summed up his embryonic international career so far: studded with shots that revealed a rare talent (such as the rasping, wristy pull for four off Brent), it again came to a self-induced end as he tried to sweep Grant Flower and got a top edge to Streak, running back at square-leg. His innings of 24 may have been his best effort yet for England, but they needed him to go on. Now they were in trouble at 73 for 5. But White and Ealham began to turn things round, with Ealham slog-sweeping Viljoen's left-arm spin for six, and White driving Streak through the covers for four the ball after England's hundred had come up. England were doing it easily, and required just 12 more with plenty of overs to spare, when things began to go horribly wrong. White slashed Olonga straight to Goodwin in the covers for 26 (120 for 6), before Chris Read, impatient after failing to score from his first 10 balls, pulled his 11th, from Brent, tamely to Craig Wishart, the substitute fielder at square-leg. England were 124 for 7, yet remained favourites. But Ealham then went lbw, playing around a slower ball from Brent for 32 (125 for 8), and Caddick followed almost immediately, bowled off stump for 0 by Viljoen as he advanced down the wicket. It was unbelievably dense cricket: from nowhere England had lost four wickets for five runs and had turned sure-fire victory into potential defeat. But Gough worked Brent fine on the legside for four, and, from the final ball of the next over, Mullally took a single to keep the strike. Two to win, one to tie. Two balls later, Mullally edged Brent to third man for four, and England had crept ignominiously to victory. Never before has a total of 131 looked so forbidding.

      "bodyText": "The government has given British Nuclear Fuels two months to prove they can change unsafe management practices at Sellafield exposed by three safety reports published today. Energy minister Helen Liddell said she was \"incensed\" at how things had gone so badly wrong at Sellafield and instructed BNFL's management to devise \"comprehensive and radical suggestions for change\" at the plant, the largest nuclear facility in the country. \"The HSE Executive's reports document serious management failures,\" said Mrs Liddell. \"I have asked him for comprehensive and radical suggestions for change, which will deliver the management that the company needs within two months.\" \"The review should regard no one and no level of the organisation as out of bounds,\" she added. The nuclear installations inspectorate reports criticised \"systematic management failure\" which allowed the falsification of fuel data and quality assurance records. Poor design of the Cumbria plant, the tedium of the job and the ease with which the computer dating logging systems was manipulated were all blamed for the problem, which dates back to 1996. But the report said that although data was falsified it would have no effect on the safety of fuel in a nuclear reactor. The damning 40-page report castigates BNFL for a lack of \"proper safety culture within this plant\". \"There can be no excuse for process workers not following procedures and deliberately falsifying records to avoid doing a tedious task. These people need to be identified and disciplined,\" the report concluded. \"However, the management on the plant allowed this to happen and since it had been going on for over three years must share responsibility.\" Five process workers have been sacked over the falsification. BNFL today accepted its responsibilities following the report, but it is not expected to sack any executives. BNFL admitted the reports had been \"damaging\" and said actions were already under way to improve the safety culture. Brian Watson, head of the Sellafield site, said: \"Our response is that safety is and remains the company's top priority and of course we take these reports extremely seriously.\" Mr Watson said he could not comment on whether any executives would have to resign or be sacked over the problem but added he did not anticipate any further dismissals of process workers. Environmental campaign group Greenpeace called for the government to end nuclear re-processing at Sellafield. \"The whole plutonium business is rotten to the core,\" said spokesman Peter Roche.

According to David Calvert-Smith, director of public prosecutions, a second trial against Shipman would be too difficult due to the huge publicity surrounding the case. Shipman, who has already been imprisoned for the murder of 15 of his female patients, is believed to have committed a total of 146 murders in his 20-year career as a medical doctor in Hyde, near Manchester. Greater Manchester police say they have enough evidence to charge Shipman with the murders of another 23 women. The families of his other suspected victims have agreed that a second trial could not take place. The first trial was limited to 15 victims so that the judge and jury would not be overwhelmed by the proceedings. Mr Calvert-Smith pointed out that Shipman has \"already been sent to prison for the rest of his natural life\". But, he added: \"I have been acutely aware of the distress of relatives of the deceased and the understandable desire of some of them for a further public trial in a criminal court.\"",

      "bodyText": "Cherie Blair yesterday launched a charm offensive to head off a Tory MP's criticism that she has quadrupled the staff of her office in Downing Street. She said it was because of her bulging mailbag and social engagement calendar. The prime minister's wife, obviously furious that she is being accused of spending taxpayers' cash on party-going and answering fan mail, offered Andrew Tyrie, MP for Chichester, the chance to bring three children from his constituency to a Downing Street tea \"to see the results of the social office's hard work\". Her surprise intervention followed a row last week at the Commons public adminstration committee when Mr Tyrie accused her husband of adopting a \"presidential lifestyle\" by dramatically increasing No 10's staff, including creating an office for his wife. The MP wrongfooted the cabinet secretary, Sir Richard Wilson, who admitted he knew nothing about Mr Blair's bulging staff and is now committed to providing the first ever rundown of the PM's closest appointments. In her letter, Mrs Blair confirmed that the staff had increased from the one part-time secretary who helped Norma Major to four people. \"Tony and I feel strongly that all members of the public who write to No 10 should receive a reply.\" The letter adds: \"We now host around 20% more social events here, many for charity.\" The most popular party was \"our monthly children's tea.\" This idea arose from the large number of children who wanted to look around No 10. She then offered the MP the chance of bringing three Chichester children between the ages of nine and 13 on March 30. Last night Mr Tyrie said he would accept but would continue to investigate Downing Street's pay bill. Downing Street's press secretary, Alastair Campbell, told lobby journalists Mr Tyrie had bombarded the cabinet secretary with \"inaccurate questions\". Mr Campbell's partner, Fiona Millar, oversees Downing Street's social programme.",

      "body": "<p>A year after his wife disappeared without trace in 1991, Richard Klinkhamer, a Dutch crime writer, visited his publisher. He had with him a manuscript which, under the circumstances, seemed a little macabre. Not to mention highly suspicious. </p> <p>The novel, Woensdag Gehaktdag (a Dutch saying which translates as Wednesday, Mince Day), was a grisly, detailed exploration of seven ways in which Klinkhamer could conceivably have killed his wife, Hannelore. In one of the scenarios set out in the book, he disposes of her body by pushing her flesh through a mincer and feeding it to the pigeons. </p> <p>When Hannelore Klinkhamer, known as Hanny, went missing from the marital home in the Groningen province in the north-east of the Netherlands nine years ago, her husband was the prime suspect. However, police inquiries were fruitless. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-435414922\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/27/1398592797452/Hannelore-Klinkhamer-001.jpg\" alt=\"Hannelore Klinkhamer\" width=\"200\" height=\"209\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hannelore Klinkhamer. Photograph: Arnold Leenart</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Arnold Leenart</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The police questioned Klinkhamer at his home, one of a tiny cluster of houses near the hamlet of Ganzedijk. He denied killing her. They put him in a cell. He denied it again. They searched the house. They searched the garden. Nothing was found. Sniffer dogs searched the garden; the police dug up the garden. A Royal Dutch airforce F-16 flew over the garden with infra-red scanners. Nothing was found. </p> <p>However strong the authorities' suspicions, there could not be a murder inquiry without a body. </p> <p>Klinkhamer lived on at the house for several years, writing and drinking heavily. But slowly the suspicion that he had killed his missing wife began to filter out beyond the close-knit community. Details of the manuscript - which his publisher, Willem Donker had rejected as too gruesome - began to surface in the Dutch underground press. </p> <p>Television programmes started to invite Klinkhamer to make guest appearances. There was an interview with him on Birds of Paradise, a series about eccentrics. In 1997, Klinkhamer moved to Amsterdam, to the Bijlmermeer district, with a new girlfriend. There he surfaced on the literary party circuit, apparently enjoying his new position as a minor cult figure among second-tier crime writers. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-435414923\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/27/1398592731573/Richard-Klinkhamer-in-Gan-004.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Klinkhamer in Ganzedijk\" width=\"200\" height=\"306\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Klinkhamer in front of the house in Ganzedijk where he murdered and buried his wife. Photograph: Karel Zwaneveld/AP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karel Zwaneveld/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, new people moved into the house he had shared with Hanny. In time, they sold up to a couple with children who decided to make alterations to the 200ft garden - getting rid of the tatty shed, for instance. </p> <p>Then, two weeks ago, they hired a digger. While breaking up the concrete laid on the floor of the shed, the workmen turned up a skull, buried in a piece of clay a few metres below the surface. They went on to uncover a skeleton which a forensic scientist quickly identified from dental records as the remains of Hanny Klinkhamer. </p> <p>That evening, Richard Klinkhamer, 62, was arrested in Amsterdam. Next day he confessed to his wife's murder and he is now awaiting trial in prison in Leeuwarden, in the north-west of the country. </p> <p>The present owner of the house seems irritated by the events. \"I've had nothing but trouble with this house,\" she says. The garden has been completely dug up and the spot where Hanny's body was discovered is marked by a thin pole, waving in the wind. A cement mixer whirrs and builders move around the garage and the green two-storey house. Can we come and see the garden? \"Only if you are willing to pay 500 to 600 guilders. If you pay the money, you can come in; if you don't, you can leave.\" </p> <p>But others who knew Hanny have been paying their respects in various ways. On Wednesday, a small gathering of her colleagues and friends met in Ganzedijk and laid flowers for Hanny, who had been a paediatric nurse at a hospital in Winschoten, half a dozen miles away. </p> <p>Yesterday, offical tributes appeared in local newspapers. She has been buried, her friends say, somewhere quiet and beautiful. \"She was a nice, intelligent woman. Everyone was very fond of her,\" says Harry Wieters, a near neighbour. It was Harry's wife, Marieke, an old friend of Hanny's from Amsterdam, who first introduced her to Ganzedijk. </p> <p>According to Dutch newspapers, Hanny's early life was marred, with eerie coincidence, by the murder of her mother. On July 15 1957, when she was just nine, Hanny discovered the dead body of her 46-year-old mother, Maria. She had been thrown downstairs by Hanny's father who then killed her with a hammer. Where he is now, or even if he's still alive, is not clear. </p> <p>Years passed and eventually Hanny rang her friend Marieke to report that she had met an entertaining, funny man named Richard Klinkhamer in Amsterdam. He was 10 years older and divorced, but she was in love. \"She was obsessed by Klinkhamer,\" says Harry Wieters. Hanny wanted to marry Klinkhamer and bring him to Ganzedijk to start a new life and, in 1978, they moved to the area. </p> <p>Things seemed to go well at first, but then Klinkhamer, who was a former foreign legionnaire, sometime auditor and part-time author, began to drink heavily. He would hit Hanny and when he did, she would go to stay with other people. \"I have seen her with blue marks on her body,\" says Wieters. </p> <p>Klinkhamer's writing career, however, began to take off. His first book, Obedient as a Dog, drew heavily on his experiences in the French Foreign Legion. The first thing they teach you, he said, is how to kill somebody; the second, how to dispose of a body properly. He later had a collection of short stories published, entitled Hotel Red. </p> <p>Like Hanny, Klinkhamer had an Austro-German background. During the war, he once told Willem Donker, that his mother had had an affair with an SS officer. He was in Austria with her when it was liberated by the Russians; he remembers that she was raped. On their return to Holland, his mother's head was shaved - the standard punishment meted out to women who had had liaisons with Nazis during the occupation. \"It was a very dark chapter of the liberation,\" says Donker. \"Later, he said, she had to make a living so she did for money what she had done for love during the war.\" </p> <p>Klinkhamer, according to Donker, had Nazi sympathies, although other acquaintances reject this. One of his books, Kruis of Munt (Heads or Tails), is a \"faction\" about the SS. His reasons for killing Hanny will probably never be known but alcohol may have been a factor. In the weeks leading up to her death, as their relationship deteriorated, he was drinking huge quantities of beer on his own at home. </p> <p>What is known, if Klinkhamer's account can be trusted, is how Hanny was killed. On January 31 1991, when she was 43 - three years younger than her mother when she was murdered - Klinkhamer beat her to death with what the police believe to have been some kind of wooden bat or handle. Then he dug a hole in the shed, dumped her in it and filled it with concrete. He used compost to disguise the smell of the rotting corpse. Six days later, he reported her missing, claiming that he had found her red bicycle at a nearby train station. At last, police launched an investigation. </p> <p>Friends of Hanny's, including the Wieters, reported the couple's domestic quarrels to police. \"I was quite certain that he did it but police couldn't prove it,\" Harry Wieters says. \"It was not very professional what the police did. He was more intelligent than the police.\" </p> <p>Donker describes the local police as \"incompetent\". But Peter Boomsma, spokesman for the regional police force at Groningen, says: \"We didn't find anything so we couldn't charge Klinkhamer.\" </p> <p>Oddly, there are plenty of neighbours who are still willing to speak well of him, despite his crime. \"Richard Klinkhamer was an eccentric man but in our eyes a good man,\" says Coos Molenaar, who lives opposite. \"Many times here he drank with us. He loved his life, he loved to write books. He built in his garden, big monuments. He never talked about his wife.\" </p> <p>Had Donker agreed to publish Klinkhamer's blueprint for murder, Wednesday, Mince Day, he might have been discovered more quickly. As it was, Donker, a small but respected publisher who pops up at London trade fairs from time to time, didn't like the book, but suggested that Klinkhamer turn two chapters into a crime novel. This he did and the book that resulted, Ransom, sold around 2,000 copies, reasonable for the Dutch market.

      "bodyText": "A year after his wife disappeared without trace in 1991, Richard Klinkhamer, a Dutch crime writer, visited his publisher. He had with him a manuscript which, under the circumstances, seemed a little macabre. Not to mention highly suspicious. The novel, Woensdag Gehaktdag (a Dutch saying which translates as Wednesday, Mince Day), was a grisly, detailed exploration of seven ways in which Klinkhamer could conceivably have killed his wife, Hannelore. In one of the scenarios set out in the book, he disposes of her body by pushing her flesh through a mincer and feeding it to the pigeons. When Hannelore Klinkhamer, known as Hanny, went missing from the marital home in the Groningen province in the north-east of the Netherlands nine years ago, her husband was the prime suspect. However, police inquiries were fruitless. The police questioned Klinkhamer at his home, one of a tiny cluster of houses near the hamlet of Ganzedijk. He denied killing her. They put him in a cell. He denied it again. They searched the house. They searched the garden. Nothing was found. Sniffer dogs searched the garden; the police dug up the garden. A Royal Dutch airforce F-16 flew over the garden with infra-red scanners. Nothing was found. However strong the authorities' suspicions, there could not be a murder inquiry without a body. Klinkhamer lived on at the house for several years, writing and drinking heavily. But slowly the suspicion that he had killed his missing wife began to filter out beyond the close-knit community. Details of the manuscript - which his publisher, Willem Donker had rejected as too gruesome - began to surface in the Dutch underground press. Television programmes started to invite Klinkhamer to make guest appearances. There was an interview with him on Birds of Paradise, a series about eccentrics. In 1997, Klinkhamer moved to Amsterdam, to the Bijlmermeer district, with a new girlfriend. There he surfaced on the literary party circuit, apparently enjoying his new position as a minor cult figure among second-tier crime writers. Meanwhile, new people moved into the house he had shared with Hanny. In time, they sold up to a couple with children who decided to make alterations to the 200ft garden - getting rid of the tatty shed, for instance. Then, two weeks ago, they hired a digger. While breaking up the concrete laid on the floor of the shed, the workmen turned up a skull, buried in a piece of clay a few metres below the surface. They went on to uncover a skeleton which a forensic scientist quickly identified from dental records as the remains of Hanny Klinkhamer. That evening, Richard Klinkhamer, 62, was arrested in Amsterdam. Next day he confessed to his wife's murder and he is now awaiting trial in prison in Leeuwarden, in the north-west of the country. The present owner of the house seems irritated by the events. \"I've had nothing but trouble with this house,\" she says. The garden has been completely dug up and the spot where Hanny's body was discovered is marked by a thin pole, waving in the wind. A cement mixer whirrs and builders move around the garage and the green two-storey house. Can we come and see the garden? \"Only if you are willing to pay 500 to 600 guilders. If you pay the money, you can come in; if you don't, you can leave.\" But others who knew Hanny have been paying their respects in various ways. On Wednesday, a small gathering of her colleagues and friends met in Ganzedijk and laid flowers for Hanny, who had been a paediatric nurse at a hospital in Winschoten, half a dozen miles away. Yesterday, offical tributes appeared in local newspapers. She has been buried, her friends say, somewhere quiet and beautiful. \"She was a nice, intelligent woman. Everyone was very fond of her,\" says Harry Wieters, a near neighbour. It was Harry's wife, Marieke, an old friend of Hanny's from Amsterdam, who first introduced her to Ganzedijk. According to Dutch newspapers, Hanny's early life was marred, with eerie coincidence, by the murder of her mother. On July 15 1957, when she was just nine, Hanny discovered the dead body of her 46-year-old mother, Maria. She had been thrown downstairs by Hanny's father who then killed her with a hammer. Where he is now, or even if he's still alive, is not clear. Years passed and eventually Hanny rang her friend Marieke to report that she had met an entertaining, funny man named Richard Klinkhamer in Amsterdam. He was 10 years older and divorced, but she was in love. \"She was obsessed by Klinkhamer,\" says Harry Wieters. Hanny wanted to marry Klinkhamer and bring him to Ganzedijk to start a new life and, in 1978, they moved to the area. Things seemed to go well at first, but then Klinkhamer, who was a former foreign legionnaire, sometime auditor and part-time author, began to drink heavily. He would hit Hanny and when he did, she would go to stay with other people. \"I have seen her with blue marks on her body,\" says Wieters. Klinkhamer's writing career, however, began to take off. His first book, Obedient as a Dog, drew heavily on his experiences in the French Foreign Legion. The first thing they teach you, he said, is how to kill somebody; the second, how to dispose of a body properly. He later had a collection of short stories published, entitled Hotel Red. Like Hanny, Klinkhamer had an Austro-German background. During the war, he once told Willem Donker, that his mother had had an affair with an SS officer. He was in Austria with her when it was liberated by the Russians; he remembers that she was raped. On their return to Holland, his mother's head was shaved - the standard punishment meted out to women who had had liaisons with Nazis during the occupation. \"It was a very dark chapter of the liberation,\" says Donker. \"Later, he said, she had to make a living so she did for money what she had done for love during the war.\" Klinkhamer, according to Donker, had Nazi sympathies, although other acquaintances reject this. One of his books, Kruis of Munt (Heads or Tails), is a \"faction\" about the SS. His reasons for killing Hanny will probably never be known but alcohol may have been a factor. In the weeks leading up to her death, as their relationship deteriorated, he was drinking huge quantities of beer on his own at home. What is known, if Klinkhamer's account can be trusted, is how Hanny was killed. On January 31 1991, when she was 43 - three years younger than her mother when she was murdered - Klinkhamer beat her to death with what the police believe to have been some kind of wooden bat or handle. Then he dug a hole in the shed, dumped her in it and filled it with concrete. He used compost to disguise the smell of the rotting corpse. Six days later, he reported her missing, claiming that he had found her red bicycle at a nearby train station. At last, police launched an investigation. Friends of Hanny's, including the Wieters, reported the couple's domestic quarrels to police. \"I was quite certain that he did it but police couldn't prove it,\" Harry Wieters says. \"It was not very professional what the police did. He was more intelligent than the police.\" Donker describes the local police as \"incompetent\". But Peter Boomsma, spokesman for the regional police force at Groningen, says: \"We didn't find anything so we couldn't charge Klinkhamer.\" Oddly, there are plenty of neighbours who are still willing to speak well of him, despite his crime. \"Richard Klinkhamer was an eccentric man but in our eyes a good man,\" says Coos Molenaar, who lives opposite. \"Many times here he drank with us. He loved his life, he loved to write books. He built in his garden, big monuments. He never talked about his wife.\" Had Donker agreed to publish Klinkhamer's blueprint for murder, Wednesday, Mince Day, he might have been discovered more quickly. As it was, Donker, a small but respected publisher who pops up at London trade fairs from time to time, didn't like the book, but suggested that Klinkhamer turn two chapters into a crime novel. This he did and the book that resulted, Ransom, sold around 2,000 copies, reasonable for the Dutch market. In Ransom, a man pretends to have stolen paintings from the Rembrandthuis gallery in Amsterdam, but, in fact, has hidden them in the gallery. Having read the original book, however, Donker suspected Klinkhamer might have killed his wife and asked him. \"It's not yet the time to talk about it,\" was the cryptic answer. Had the killing remained secret for another nine years, Klinkhamer could not have been prosecuted under the Dutch statute of limitations law. However, during his last years of freedom, he could hardly have done more to attract suspicion to himself, other than erecting signs to his wife's grave. \"Everyone is able to murder someone, somewhere, suddenly,\" he would hint.

During the second world war he was a military economist, and, in defeated Germany, his observation of the curtailment of de-Nazification - with the cold war and the need to re- establish business confidence - left an indelible impression.

He moved to the University of Illinois and, in 1969, to the University of California, San Diego, where the German Marxist philosopher Herbert Marcuse and the black American communist Angela Davis were teaching radical ideas.

He was in constant demand as a star speaker, a skill that contributed to his influential role in Unesco debates, where the free-flow-of-information doctrine began to be seen as a pro-west ideology. This criticism was a factor in the American and British withdrawal of financial aid from Unesco in the mid-1980s. </p> <p>Schiller wrote for many publications, including Le Monde Diplomatique in France and the Nation in the US. Mass Communications And American Empire (1969) and The Mind Managers (1973) are probably his best-known studies.

In Culture Inc (1989), he highlighted the corporate invasion of public spaces.

      "body": "<p>Michael Heseltine last night fired a shot across the bows of the Tory leadership when he warned that William Hague's Keep the Pound campaign would fail to win any votes at the next election. </p> <p>The former deputy prime minister, who is to take part next week in a campaign against Tory Euro scepticism, echoed Tony Blair's view that the next election will be decided on bread and butter issues. </p> <p>Speaking on BBC1's Question Time, Mr Heseltine said: \"The main policy is not going to be save the pound because my own judgment is that there's not a lot of votes - moving votes - in the issue of Europe. That's why you get these derisory turnouts when it comes to European elections. The big issues at the next election will be what they always are - the economy, education, health.\" </p> <p>His intervention will hardly come as a surprise to the Tory leadership which has reluctantly come to terms with the fervently pro-European views of the former deputy prime minister. Mr Heseltine is one of the few Tory \"big beasts\" left in the Commons and is a leading member of the Britain in Europe group which will launch a pro-European cam paign next week under the slogan Out of Europe Out of Work.

      "bodyText": "Michael Heseltine last night fired a shot across the bows of the Tory leadership when he warned that William Hague's Keep the Pound campaign would fail to win any votes at the next election. The former deputy prime minister, who is to take part next week in a campaign against Tory Euro scepticism, echoed Tony Blair's view that the next election will be decided on bread and butter issues. Speaking on BBC1's Question Time, Mr Heseltine said: \"The main policy is not going to be save the pound because my own judgment is that there's not a lot of votes - moving votes - in the issue of Europe. That's why you get these derisory turnouts when it comes to European elections. The big issues at the next election will be what they always are - the economy, education, health.\" His intervention will hardly come as a surprise to the Tory leadership which has reluctantly come to terms with the fervently pro-European views of the former deputy prime minister. Mr Heseltine is one of the few Tory \"big beasts\" left in the Commons and is a leading member of the Britain in Europe group which will launch a pro-European cam paign next week under the slogan Out of Europe Out of Work. But there will be irritation with Mr Heseltine at Central Office for dismissing Mr Hague's new Keep the Pound campaign just days after its launch. The criticisms by Mr Heseltine echo warnings from Tory pollsters that the party's stance on Europe is backward-looking. The research, which was carried out before last summer's Euro elections, said voters were unlikely to change allegiance over the single currency because domestic issues are seen as more important. Mr Hague believes the Tories' victory in last June's election shows his opposition to the single currency is a vote winner. Critics within the party point out the turn-out of less than 10% was so low that it was wrong to draw firm conclusions from the result. John Maples, recently sacked by Mr Hague as shadow foreign secretary, warned this week that the Keep the Pound campaign could undermine the Tories at the next election if the Mr Hague decides to rule out a referendum on the euro in the next parliament. \"If he does that we will have a dead fox at our feet,\" Mr Maples wrote in the Times. \"We need to set another one running now.\"",

      "body": "<p><strong> Mickey Blue Eyes</strong><br>Rental <br>Universal Pictures Cert 15 <br>***</p> <p>Those of you who could barely raise a smile on behalf of Notting Hill will, I think, find an acceptable amount of chucklement from Hugh Grant's rather nifty new comedy. You'll probably know that it's Hugh meets the mob, but careful plotting and some inspired moments make it considerably funnier and less stereotyped than the high concept suggests.</p> <p>Old floppy - his hair gets a plot mention of its own for the second film running and may soon have its own agent - is an auctioneer who is about to propose to his girlfriend (Jeanne Tripplehorn) although he has yet to meet her father (James Caan). First he meets Vinny, Carmine and Louie. \"Mostly family then?\" he enquires, with unknowing accuracy.</p> <p>Caan plays a rare comedy role against expectation (he's more Soprano than Corleone this time) and the film quickly gets you on its side with a superbly realised spiralling scene in a Chinese restaurant where Grant tries to arrange a proposal through a prearranged fortune cookie. The minor mobsters, led by a scene-stealing veteran Burt Young, come closer to parody than Caan but only James Fox, as a silly-arse Englishman, is allowed to take it too far by director Kelly Makin, from TV's Kids in the Hall.</p> <p>There's fun to be had as the gangsters use Grant for money-laundering by selling hideous paintings through his auction house and the \"fahgeddaboudit\" scene (as Caan gives Grant elocution lessons to try to pass muster as a mobster) has been much parroted around the office.</p> <p>The elaborate ending nearly becomes one wedding and four funerals.

      "bodyText": "Mickey Blue Eyes Rental Universal Pictures Cert 15 *** Those of you who could barely raise a smile on behalf of Notting Hill will, I think, find an acceptable amount of chucklement from Hugh Grant's rather nifty new comedy. You'll probably know that it's Hugh meets the mob, but careful plotting and some inspired moments make it considerably funnier and less stereotyped than the high concept suggests. Old floppy - his hair gets a plot mention of its own for the second film running and may soon have its own agent - is an auctioneer who is about to propose to his girlfriend (Jeanne Tripplehorn) although he has yet to meet her father (James Caan). First he meets Vinny, Carmine and Louie. \"Mostly family then?\" he enquires, with unknowing accuracy. Caan plays a rare comedy role against expectation (he's more Soprano than Corleone this time) and the film quickly gets you on its side with a superbly realised spiralling scene in a Chinese restaurant where Grant tries to arrange a proposal through a prearranged fortune cookie. The minor mobsters, led by a scene-stealing veteran Burt Young, come closer to parody than Caan but only James Fox, as a silly-arse Englishman, is allowed to take it too far by director Kelly Makin, from TV's Kids in the Hall. There's fun to be had as the gangsters use Grant for money-laundering by selling hideous paintings through his auction house and the \"fahgeddaboudit\" scene (as Caan gives Grant elocution lessons to try to pass muster as a mobster) has been much parroted around the office. The elaborate ending nearly becomes one wedding and four funerals. It's energetic and amiable and the cast looks like it had a good time.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>As any internet user knows, there are countless sites devoted to shots of celebrities in the nude and there's possibly an even bigger number of celebrity fakes sites. A celebrity fake is where you take the head of a starlet and, via the unending magic of computers, stick it on the body of a porn model. Isn't technology wonderful? So what if Meg Ryan has never done an explicit sex scene? So what if Jennifer Aniston has never shown the world her breasts? You can find endless shots of them performing outr\u00e9 sex acts.</p> <p>It's a big industry, celebrity fakes, and the craft that goes into some of these pictures is extraordinary. Obviously it's mostly women but there are a few men - David Duchovny and the blokes off Star Trek are particular favourites.</p> <p>You'd have to search far and wide, though, for a celebrity fake of John Malkovich. He's not exactly in the top 10 sex gods list, though I do remember several female acquaintances getting quite hot and bothered over his stage appearance in Burn This. But, let's face it, he's not boy band material, even the gawky ugly one that's there to make the others look prettier, not with his \"male pattern baldness, and too prominent brow\" (a line from his new film, Being John Malkovich). The reason I bring this up is that there's a scene in Being John Malkovich that's unsettlingly reminiscent of celebrity fakes sites. </p> <p>The film is the surreal new instant-cult, movie from rock video director Spike Jonze (pronounced Jones, and not to be confused with the other Spike Jones, who made wacky comedy records in the 40s and 50s.) The scene involves Malkovich, who plays himself, ending up in a world entirely populated by John Malkoviches. That's to say there are voluptuous women with stuck-on Malkovich heads, young men with Malkovich heads, old men, hell, there's even a dwarf. Is it the ultimate existential nightmare? Is it a telling indictment of celebrity culture? Or is it just a funny scene with some neat computer-generated visuals? </p> <p>It's that type of film, you see, you can never work out if it's really, really, profound or just mucking about. It will, I'm afraid, generate a forest of comment in serious papers, like this one, with too many sections to fill, What is the nature of celebrity? What is the nature of self? And how does the weird relationship between fan and celebrity work? You can look forward to loads of articles like the ones we had to endure when The Truman Show and EdTV came out. Oh, Christ, I'm writing one now...</p> <p>So... Being John Malkovich. Some people are going to claim this is one of the finest films ever made - dark, funny and strange - others will want to throw rocks at the screen. A brief outline of its plot should let you know which camp you're more likely to pitch your tent in, so here it is: \"Man finds secret portal to the inside of John Malkovich's head.\" Or, in the words of its director, \"The film is about New York City, a puppeteer, a tragic marriage, a chimp, a boss, a receptionist, another woman, an actor, the New Jersey Turnpike and a plate of lasagne.\" </p> <p>Still not sure? Well, how about this. John Cusack, the \"hero\", a down-at-heel street puppeteer, takes a filing job on the 7\u00bdth floor of an office block, where the lift stop between levels, the ceilings are half height and everyone walks in a crouch. Funny or stupid? It's destined to be one of those revered cult movies that exist somewhere on the fringes between surrealism and science fiction, - like Eraserhead, Brazil, Repo Man, Pi and their ilk. </p> <p>I enjoyed the film. It's nothing like most American films being made these days, but it didn't totally win me over, but then I'd had a wisdom tooth out on the day I saw it. Sorry, you really don't want to know about me, you want to know about the film. Or do you?</p> <p>Are you reading this because you're interested in Being John Malkovich, or because you saw that it was written by Charlie Higson, a name you vaguely recognise off TV? Why? I mean, why, really, is the opinion of a celebrity more valid than anyone else's? When I was younger, reading the NME was de rigueur, and you'd be constantly amused by the parade of idiotic pop stars being asked their opinions on politics and world affairs. They just play guitars, for God's sake, how can they be expected to sort out the problems in Northern Ireland? </p> <p>Just the other night, Geri Spice was on TV gallivanting around the world emoting at this and that for the United Nations. Why? What does celebrity mean in the modern world? Who is John Malkovich? Why would anyone want to be him? And what exactly is a \"portal\" to the inside of his head? Well, it's this, like, you know, sort of tunnel thing, and when you, like, er, go into it, you get to look out of John Malkovich, you see what he sees, feel what he feels, for about 15 minutes before being spat out and dropped by the side of the road. </p> <p>I'm glad we've cleared that up. </p> <p>So, that's what the film's about, then, but what's it about? At the risk of being pretentious, it's about the ownership of the self, and the idea that celebrity is a commodity. There, I've said it. I mean, obviously, for most people watching, it's not about that at all - it's about \"a secret portal to the inside of John Malkovich's head.\" But when the Guardian's paying you, you are compelled to fork over all those modern obsessions like stalking, docu-soaps, Stars in Their Eyes, Ali G and celebrity fakes. I don't need to go into any of that here now, because you already know what I'd say; that we are living in a world where there has been a catastrophic blurring of the line between ordinary people and celebrities.</p> <p>So how does Malkovich fit into all this? Why was he picked to be the subject of this film? The film-makers claim they used him partly because he has one of those names that the more you say it the funnier it sounds, and the less meaning it has, but he was an inspired choice in many other ways. You might think, \"Why John Malkovich? Why not a bigger star?\" John Cusack, and definitely Cameron Diaz (who plays his wife) are better known to cinemagoers than Malkovich, so why not \"Being John Cusack\"? No, it doesn't work, does it? Where's the fun in visiting John Cusack? </p> <p>There's something so right about Malkovich. He's one of those actors that most people know but can' t always quite place; he's been in some big movies but never as \"The Star\". And he's also seen as being a bit pompous and serious, a proper actor, a stage actor. He's great to take the piss out of, and he wouldn' t mind me saying that because he spends this whole film taking the piss out of himself, in a very un-American way. </p> <p>When Cusack first \"enters him\", we find him to be a slightly sad and lonely figure living all alone in an ascetic apartment. The first person he meets is a limo driver who knows him but can't quite place him. And this happens over and over again, even the main protagonists of the film don't really know who he is, they just respond to the fact that he's famous, and that's all that's important. Soon there's a queue of people lining up to pay to enter Malkovich, but for at least one of them, he wasn't their first choice of celebrity to visit. After a while the various visitors to Malkovich aren' t even bothered about who he really is anyway; they use him as a puppet to act out their own fantasies and desires. </p> <p>The real Malkovich slowly disappears, and you end up feeling sorry for the poor man. He has become nothing more than a vessel for the other characters' obsessions, a commodity, an object to be used just as other celebrities' bodies are used in celebrity fakes sites; it doesn't matter that it isn't real. By the end of the film he becomes \"the Malkovich vessel\". </p> <p>And that's what a star is, a vessel for our own projections and fantasies. A living embodiment, a voodoo doll for our desires. Stories have always existed to be told around the fire in the safe confines of the home. Nowadays, films and television create alternative lives for us, we watch soap operas instead of connecting with other people. We play computer games in which we become the characters. We do nothing. We live through the stars. And the stars become the roles they play. </p> <p>Who knows the names of the characters played by most stars in their films? No one. We go to see \"a Clint Eastwood movie\" or a Tom Cruise film. The character on the screen, the star, and your image of the star are one and the same thing. The only person who knows different is the star himself. And who cares what they think? </p> <p>Stars are public property.

      "bodyText": "As any internet user knows, there are countless sites devoted to shots of celebrities in the nude and there's possibly an even bigger number of celebrity fakes sites. A celebrity fake is where you take the head of a starlet and, via the unending magic of computers, stick it on the body of a porn model. Isn't technology wonderful? So what if Meg Ryan has never done an explicit sex scene? So what if Jennifer Aniston has never shown the world her breasts? You can find endless shots of them performing outr\u00e9 sex acts. It's a big industry, celebrity fakes, and the craft that goes into some of these pictures is extraordinary. Obviously it's mostly women but there are a few men - David Duchovny and the blokes off Star Trek are particular favourites. You'd have to search far and wide, though, for a celebrity fake of John Malkovich. He's not exactly in the top 10 sex gods list, though I do remember several female acquaintances getting quite hot and bothered over his stage appearance in Burn This. But, let's face it, he's not boy band material, even the gawky ugly one that's there to make the others look prettier, not with his \"male pattern baldness, and too prominent brow\" (a line from his new film, Being John Malkovich). The reason I bring this up is that there's a scene in Being John Malkovich that's unsettlingly reminiscent of celebrity fakes sites. The film is the surreal new instant-cult, movie from rock video director Spike Jonze (pronounced Jones, and not to be confused with the other Spike Jones, who made wacky comedy records in the 40s and 50s.) The scene involves Malkovich, who plays himself, ending up in a world entirely populated by John Malkoviches. That's to say there are voluptuous women with stuck-on Malkovich heads, young men with Malkovich heads, old men, hell, there's even a dwarf. Is it the ultimate existential nightmare? Is it a telling indictment of celebrity culture? Or is it just a funny scene with some neat computer-generated visuals? It's that type of film, you see, you can never work out if it's really, really, profound or just mucking about. It will, I'm afraid, generate a forest of comment in serious papers, like this one, with too many sections to fill, What is the nature of celebrity? What is the nature of self? And how does the weird relationship between fan and celebrity work? You can look forward to loads of articles like the ones we had to endure when The Truman Show and EdTV came out. Oh, Christ, I'm writing one now... So... Being John Malkovich. Some people are going to claim this is one of the finest films ever made - dark, funny and strange - others will want to throw rocks at the screen. A brief outline of its plot should let you know which camp you're more likely to pitch your tent in, so here it is: \"Man finds secret portal to the inside of John Malkovich's head.\" Or, in the words of its director, \"The film is about New York City, a puppeteer, a tragic marriage, a chimp, a boss, a receptionist, another woman, an actor, the New Jersey Turnpike and a plate of lasagne.\" Still not sure? Well, how about this. John Cusack, the \"hero\", a down-at-heel street puppeteer, takes a filing job on the 7\u00bdth floor of an office block, where the lift stop between levels, the ceilings are half height and everyone walks in a crouch. Funny or stupid? It's destined to be one of those revered cult movies that exist somewhere on the fringes between surrealism and science fiction, - like Eraserhead, Brazil, Repo Man, Pi and their ilk. I enjoyed the film. It's nothing like most American films being made these days, but it didn't totally win me over, but then I'd had a wisdom tooth out on the day I saw it. Sorry, you really don't want to know about me, you want to know about the film. Or do you? Are you reading this because you're interested in Being John Malkovich, or because you saw that it was written by Charlie Higson, a name you vaguely recognise off TV? Why? I mean, why, really, is the opinion of a celebrity more valid than anyone else's? When I was younger, reading the NME was de rigueur, and you'd be constantly amused by the parade of idiotic pop stars being asked their opinions on politics and world affairs. They just play guitars, for God's sake, how can they be expected to sort out the problems in Northern Ireland? Just the other night, Geri Spice was on TV gallivanting around the world emoting at this and that for the United Nations. Why? What does celebrity mean in the modern world? Who is John Malkovich? Why would anyone want to be him? And what exactly is a \"portal\" to the inside of his head? Well, it's this, like, you know, sort of tunnel thing, and when you, like, er, go into it, you get to look out of John Malkovich, you see what he sees, feel what he feels, for about 15 minutes before being spat out and dropped by the side of the road. I'm glad we've cleared that up. So, that's what the film's about, then, but what's it about? At the risk of being pretentious, it's about the ownership of the self, and the idea that celebrity is a commodity. There, I've said it. I mean, obviously, for most people watching, it's not about that at all - it's about \"a secret portal to the inside of John Malkovich's head.\" But when the Guardian's paying you, you are compelled to fork over all those modern obsessions like stalking, docu-soaps, Stars in Their Eyes, Ali G and celebrity fakes. I don't need to go into any of that here now, because you already know what I'd say; that we are living in a world where there has been a catastrophic blurring of the line between ordinary people and celebrities. So how does Malkovich fit into all this? Why was he picked to be the subject of this film? The film-makers claim they used him partly because he has one of those names that the more you say it the funnier it sounds, and the less meaning it has, but he was an inspired choice in many other ways. You might think, \"Why John Malkovich? Why not a bigger star?\" John Cusack, and definitely Cameron Diaz (who plays his wife) are better known to cinemagoers than Malkovich, so why not \"Being John Cusack\"? No, it doesn't work, does it? Where's the fun in visiting John Cusack? There's something so right about Malkovich. He's one of those actors that most people know but can' t always quite place; he's been in some big movies but never as \"The Star\". And he's also seen as being a bit pompous and serious, a proper actor, a stage actor. He's great to take the piss out of, and he wouldn' t mind me saying that because he spends this whole film taking the piss out of himself, in a very un-American way. When Cusack first \"enters him\", we find him to be a slightly sad and lonely figure living all alone in an ascetic apartment. The first person he meets is a limo driver who knows him but can't quite place him. And this happens over and over again, even the main protagonists of the film don't really know who he is, they just respond to the fact that he's famous, and that's all that's important. Soon there's a queue of people lining up to pay to enter Malkovich, but for at least one of them, he wasn't their first choice of celebrity to visit. After a while the various visitors to Malkovich aren' t even bothered about who he really is anyway; they use him as a puppet to act out their own fantasies and desires. The real Malkovich slowly disappears, and you end up feeling sorry for the poor man. He has become nothing more than a vessel for the other characters' obsessions, a commodity, an object to be used just as other celebrities' bodies are used in celebrity fakes sites; it doesn't matter that it isn't real. By the end of the film he becomes \"the Malkovich vessel\". And that's what a star is, a vessel for our own projections and fantasies. A living embodiment, a voodoo doll for our desires. Stories have always existed to be told around the fire in the safe confines of the home. Nowadays, films and television create alternative lives for us, we watch soap operas instead of connecting with other people. We play computer games in which we become the characters. We do nothing. We live through the stars. And the stars become the roles they play. Who knows the names of the characters played by most stars in their films? No one. We go to see \"a Clint Eastwood movie\" or a Tom Cruise film. The character on the screen, the star, and your image of the star are one and the same thing. The only person who knows different is the star himself. And who cares what they think? Stars are public property. There is a feeling that if you go on television, then you are owned by the viewers, you owe them something. \"Hey, we watched you, you came into our homes, you belong to us.\" We've all experienced that moment when you're walking down the street and you pass somebody familiar off the TV screen, and, before you clock who it really is, you nod and say hello, just to be polite, because after all you know this person. And then you realise that of course you don't know them. But sometimes they nod back. The fan controls the star. Film stars belong to us. Celebrities end up being horribly familiar and God-like at the same time. In the olden days, mad people thought God was talking to them. Nowadays mad people believe that Elvis is talking to them, or Jodie Foster, or John Lennon. Why do fans who get totally obsessed with a celebrity end up wanting to kill them? Do they blame the celebrity for their obsession, or do they set murder as the ultimate form of control? I don't think this is in any way a new phenomenon; we've always had a controlling relationship with our gods and heroes. Look at the myths of ancient Greece. Somebody made them up.

He stomps a 10-year-old boy to death on Hollywood Boulevard as a huge and increasingly demented crowd congregates outside Grauman's Chinese Theater (\"Kahn's Persian\" in the novel).

If you do this, your after-dinner coffee will be enlivened by the magically surreal sight of Musso's ancient, uniformed waiters shuffling toward you en masse bearing a slice of cake with a single lighted candle, and singing \"Happy Birthday\" in the grimmest, most funereal baritones. In the heart of Hollywood, home of the invisible face-lift and the miracle arse-tuck, there's no tonic more revivifying than the sight of Death's legions marching towards you so unsteadily. </p> <p>And that, ladies and gentlemen, was the sum of our entertainment that evening.

Much has been made of his wish to alienate his bobbysoxer demographic, and yet retain the respect of people who thought he was a great young actor from the moment he bulldozed Robert De Niro offscreen in This Boy's Life. But for the moment he's trapped in a Michael J Fox holding-pattern, waiting for his teenage face to catch up with his adult talent. One day DiCaprio will stand tall in the ruins of his beauty, with Titanic's pubescent adherents by then in junior college, and he'll finally be able to resume the serious business of being a pretty fine actor, instead of a fine, albeit pretty one. </p> <p>The Beach may well scare off the wussier elements of Seventeen magazine's subscription base. Scaring up business may be another matter. The Beach only hit second place - $15.3m was very disappointing given the perceived pulling-power of the lead - and failed to dislodge Scream 3 from its topmost perch. Come the Presidents' Day long weekend, all the stale Christmas blockbusters will be retired to make way for the next round of big releases, and The Beach may well be swept away in the deluge. </p> <p>After the movie, as we bobbed along in the exiting crowd, I flashed back, Tod Hackett-style, to an afternoon last spring on a deserted beach in southern Baha, a thousand miles south of where I'm sitting. My old friend Robert, visiting from London and glad to be away from it all, wrapped what must have been the day's twentieth Bebop B&amp;H. He squinted into the powerful sun, taking in the howling wall of waves a hundred yards away (wave-wise, by the way, Nathanael West was all at sea) and the miles of bare sand, and said, \"You know what phrase I'm just so fucking sick and tired of hearing? This one: 'You just have to read The Beach.'\" </p> <p>And in the crowd, as we were borne (ceaselessly, backwards) by the currents of Leo's Bimbo Inferno toward Hollywood Boulevard - the one with all the Broken Dreams - I zapped back to the present and thought, \"No, no, no.

With the lights dimmed, the show began with a single model wearing a white boned top with glowing green fibre-optic lights sewn into the back, followed by another wearing a green mesh top and mask.</p> <p>Webber, 28, successfully combined leather, mohair and cashmere. Slashed jersey tops in cream teamed easily with red leather skirts, sheepskin coats and blue mesh trousers. Lime green dominated, with hipster trousers, translucent dresses and glittery tops. Webber added fuel to the fur debate with fur-patched tops and a reversed fur coat, which some people started to applaud - then soon realised not too.</p> <p>London Fashion Week has been noted for its inclusion of young designers, many of whom have been given a slot on the official roster for the first time after Marks &amp; Spencer sponsored six \"new generation\" designers.</p> <p>The store made another bid to turn around its dismal profits by launching its Autograph collection yesterday.

      "bodyText": "British designer Tristan Webber yesterday showed his sixth London collection, under the title C9H13NO3 - the chemical formula for adrenaline. The show's three themes - fright, fight and flight - represented the body's changing skin patterns during the release of adrenaline. With the lights dimmed, the show began with a single model wearing a white boned top with glowing green fibre-optic lights sewn into the back, followed by another wearing a green mesh top and mask. Webber, 28, successfully combined leather, mohair and cashmere. Slashed jersey tops in cream teamed easily with red leather skirts, sheepskin coats and blue mesh trousers. Lime green dominated, with hipster trousers, translucent dresses and glittery tops. Webber added fuel to the fur debate with fur-patched tops and a reversed fur coat, which some people started to applaud - then soon realised not too. London Fashion Week has been noted for its inclusion of young designers, many of whom have been given a slot on the official roster for the first time after Marks &amp; Spencer sponsored six \"new generation\" designers. The store made another bid to turn around its dismal profits by launching its Autograph collection yesterday. The collection is designed by top British names including Betty Jackson, Katharine Hamnett and Julien Macdonald. The range will go on sale in 13 high profile stores nationwide and three in Europe on March 2. Clothes will be sold from special \"capsule boutiques\" within the stores, designed to create an environment similar to that of an exclusive boutique. They will feature spacious changing rooms with night and day lighting and comfortable sofas for long suffering husbands. Up to 200 Marks &amp; Spencer sales staff across the country have received training on \"personal shopping\" so they can advise customers on clothes to suit their colouring, body shape and lifestyle.",

Its 1999 pre-tax profits rose 28% to \u00a395.9m on turnover 23% up at \u00a31.41bn. Its order book stands at a record \u00a32bn. The group also announced that it had won a contract to provide and run the systems for Ze Project, an internet-based financial services venture from the private stable of Bernard Arnault, the French businessman who heads the Louis Vuitton Mo\u00ebt Hennessy luxury goods combine. Ze Project aims to offer a full range of financial services online to several million European customers within three years. Sema said it would be paid according to Ze Project's \"level of activity\", a business model which, it said, is becoming popular in the US and UK. Pierre Bonelli, Sema's chief executive, said the group had achieved continued growth in its core markets as well as \"the benefits of our strategic focus on high-growth new technology areas and markets\". The past year had seen the start of SemaVision, a software package designed for the telecom industry. SemaVision customers included Vodafone and Telecom Italia Mobile. \"In addition we have experienced a huge growth in the demand for our e-business expertise and services,\" Mr Bonelli said. \"The record strength of our order book further underpins our prospects and global opportunities for 2000 and beyond.\" The group said its core busi ness had won a number of big contracts last year with clients such as the Labour party, Cable &amp; Wireless and the Metropolitan Police. Sema said it was still looking to acquire a company in the North American telecommunications market but would not rush into a purchase. Corporate communications director Marie-Claude Bessis explained: \"We are still looking to acquire a company in the US but we will take our time because we want a perfect fit and we want to find a company that can bring us a value comparing to what we do. \"We are looking very carefully, and will only acquire a company with a perfect fit.

      "body": "<p>In a stock market where the internet has torn up all the valuation rules, Interactive Investor International, which made its \u00a3550m debut yesterday, has more substance than most. </p> <p>In net years iii is old, having started in late 1994. Its user base is the biggest among the personal finance websites, with 389,000 individuals registered. </p> <p>The company is not just benefiting from internet euphoria, it is at the very heart of it, too. Its users are the new army of small investors who have leapt on to the hi-tech share trading bandwagon and use the iii chat rooms and bulletin boards to swap investment tips, dubious or not. They are also behind the phenomenal increase in stock exchange trading volumes that has left internet stockbrokers such as Halifax and Barclays stockbrokers groaning under the strain of new business. </p> <p>More than 80,000 people scrambled to buy shares in iii, so little wonder that it was oversubscribed 26 times. </p> <p>It leaves the aftermarket for the shares looking healthy. There are still few signs of institutional investor fatigue on e-shares, with yesterday's jump in Halifax's share price evidence of the City's continuing obsession with anything carrying an e-halo. Institutions still under-own tech shares, and when indices such as Techmark 100 rebase in three months' time, possibly to include iii, more investors will be pulled in. </p> <p>But it still stretches credibility that the company can satisfy yesterday's valuation. iii's sales last year were a paltry \u00a32.6m - less than one-twohundredth of its debut stock market value. Around half of its revenues come from advertising to its admittedly high net worth individuals and from fees earned each time they request a product brochure from a life, pension or investment provider. </p> <p>But even if that is multiplied by five times next year, it would give iii revenues of just \u00a37.5m, about enough to wipe out last year's losses, and less than its accumulated debt. Financial intermediaries don't make money handing out brochures, they make it from commission on selling products, which iii does not do. </p> <p>One strength is the media muscle of 30% owner Hollinger, which owns the Telegraph newspapers. But the Telegraph titles have shown little support for their younger sibling, and the options for cross-promotion between old and new media look slim. But the biggest risk for iii is from the traditional financial institutions. Halifax is belatedly waking up to the net, and Abbey National is not far behind. Prudential, with its Egg site, has taken a strong lead. When it comes to selling life, pensions and investment products, iii will be hard put to withstand such competition.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In a stock market where the internet has torn up all the valuation rules, Interactive Investor International, which made its \u00a3550m debut yesterday, has more substance than most. In net years iii is old, having started in late 1994. Its user base is the biggest among the personal finance websites, with 389,000 individuals registered. The company is not just benefiting from internet euphoria, it is at the very heart of it, too. Its users are the new army of small investors who have leapt on to the hi-tech share trading bandwagon and use the iii chat rooms and bulletin boards to swap investment tips, dubious or not. They are also behind the phenomenal increase in stock exchange trading volumes that has left internet stockbrokers such as Halifax and Barclays stockbrokers groaning under the strain of new business. More than 80,000 people scrambled to buy shares in iii, so little wonder that it was oversubscribed 26 times. It leaves the aftermarket for the shares looking healthy. There are still few signs of institutional investor fatigue on e-shares, with yesterday's jump in Halifax's share price evidence of the City's continuing obsession with anything carrying an e-halo. Institutions still under-own tech shares, and when indices such as Techmark 100 rebase in three months' time, possibly to include iii, more investors will be pulled in. But it still stretches credibility that the company can satisfy yesterday's valuation. iii's sales last year were a paltry \u00a32.6m - less than one-twohundredth of its debut stock market value. Around half of its revenues come from advertising to its admittedly high net worth individuals and from fees earned each time they request a product brochure from a life, pension or investment provider. But even if that is multiplied by five times next year, it would give iii revenues of just \u00a37.5m, about enough to wipe out last year's losses, and less than its accumulated debt. Financial intermediaries don't make money handing out brochures, they make it from commission on selling products, which iii does not do. One strength is the media muscle of 30% owner Hollinger, which owns the Telegraph newspapers. But the Telegraph titles have shown little support for their younger sibling, and the options for cross-promotion between old and new media look slim. But the biggest risk for iii is from the traditional financial institutions. Halifax is belatedly waking up to the net, and Abbey National is not far behind. Prudential, with its Egg site, has taken a strong lead. When it comes to selling life, pensions and investment products, iii will be hard put to withstand such competition.",

Of course, schools can't teach children to get married, nor can governments prod unwilling adults to the altar.

Gordon Brown is about to redistribute large sums of money from fathers to mothers in a wallet to handbag transfer. It was whispered in one short line in his last budget and it will emerge in full in next month's, though probably not spun in quite those terms. (Governments have always been uneasy about overtly taking from men to give to women.)</p> <p>Here's the story. Arm sharply twisted by a caucus of Tory female high flyers, Nigel Lawson reluctantly brought in women's independent taxation. Households would no longer be taxed together, but each partner would be treated separately. It made a great many already well off couples a great deal richer. It was bonanza time in households with two high taxpayers, widening the wealth gap between haves and have-nots in a country increasingly divided between two-earner and no-earner families. Rich women's politics triumphed over class politics - a mistake, but now probably irreversible.</p> <p>This liberation from tax was not much use to poor women who earn too little to pay any or to women on benefits. The social security system stayed unreformed, treating women in couples as men's chattels. After computing the incomes of both partners and the number and ages of children, all entitlements are paid to the man. The mother has no independent right (except in rare cases where she's nominated instead). The giro goes to the father, stepfather or to a male cohabitee (any man who stays three nights a week).</p> <p>What effect does that have on poor families on benefit? It explains why they divorce and separate in far higher numbers than the better off. A woman on her own with her children claims all the benefits, including rent and council tax. Where women control the purse strings, research shows they spend far more on the household, food and children than when men control the money. Research on divorcing women living on benefits shows how much richer they feel once they control all their own money. Men who keep more than a very small sum from the family benefit giro can leave women and children virtually destitute. Those worried about saving marriages have had nothing to say about a system which obliged many mothers to abandon men in order to feed their children.</p> <p>In justice, poor women should have had the same financial liberation as well-off women, with a benefits system as blind to their cohabiting arrangements as the tax system now is. But disaggregating family incomes on social security would be phenomenally expensive: the tax bonus rich couples got from the state was welcomed, but a similar windfall for the poor would be politically unacceptable because it would be a new work disincentive. However, the chancellor is about to do the second best thing: family income will still be computed together but the mother will for the first time collect all the entitlement for herself and her children. Her partner will only collect his own personal allowance. Since all the growth in the social security system is to be increasingly piled onto the new integrated children's credit, most family money will rest in the far safer hands of mothers. It will put right the mistake made when family credit (paid to mothers) was ditched in favour of working family's tax credit (paid into men's pay packets for couples).</p> <p>A joint treasury and social security committee has been working out how to combine tax and benefits - something that should have been done 50 years ago. By 2003 the new working family tax credit will have been abolished in favour of a far more subtle and finely tuned mechanism designed to eliminate the big barrier preventing parents taking jobs. Integrated child credit will be a completely secure and permanent cushion to support poorer children. It will not vary when either parent moves in or out of work. It will iron out the glitches that make parents, especially single mothers, afraid to take a job for fear of weeks without benefit if the job fails. It's a kind of junior citizens income, but neatly targeted at lower earners, making it worth risking a temporary job - the best route to a permanent one - by keeping families afloat through bumpy times.</p> <p>Will this achieve Labour's promise to abolish child poverty? It's a well-honed silver chute to pour money straight to poor children, but it depends how much money goes down it. Abolishing poverty isn't just a matter of direct funds but how much money goes to all the other poverty-busting schemes. Will the economy and employment stay buoyant? Will schools turn out no more future parents doomed to fail? Sure Start, for babies at risk, must work and it may take 10 years before we know if Blunkett's babies will succeed. Ending poverty remains a breathtakingly ambitious endeavour.</p> <p>It depends most of all on creating a long-term public will to do it. So far Labour has not done much to persuade the electorate what public money can do in these times of affluence. There is a limit to how much money can go to children through social security if Labour keeps promising to cut the DSS budget. Increasing it might be a better boast. But just as they tax by stealth, so far they have been paying out by stealth too: all Brown's generous new benefits have been relabelled as tax credits and no longer appear on the DSS budget but are hidden away in inland revenue accounts. It won't work. The Daily Mail and the Tories will insist on counting these into the overall social security bill. In the end, just as you need sustainable economic growth, so you also need sustainable public support for what you are doing. Not enough money can be stealthily spent on poverty programmes: the public has to be proud of what is being done in its name.</p> <p>That is the big question for the next election. Labour has the Tories skewered on their daft low tax pledge: Hague's tax guarantee is easily bounced back as the Tory cuts guarantee. But Labour needs to say publicly that more spending, a lot more, is required. That will mean more taxing, which requires people to be persuaded that well-spent tax pounds can buy richer things than the pounds in their pocket. The first place to begin is with national insurance contributions: this is the budget to remove the NI artificial ceiling which allows the rich to pay a smaller share of their income than everyone else. It would raise a splendid \u00a34.8bn - serious money to put towards that difficult, multi-faceted poverty pledge.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Russian forces are to start sealing off the Chechen capital today in the latest attempt to stamp their authority indelibly on the rebel republic at the expense of thousands of civilians who have been uprooted from the destroyed city.</p> <p>While streams of refugees wend their way back to Grozny to discover the fate of their houses and belongings, Russian officers signalled that the city was to be made a no-go area indefinitely and that no one would be allowed to return home.</p> <p>There were also growing reports of Russian abuse, rape, torture and executions of civilians and suspected guerrillas. The World Organisation Against Torture issued a statement in Geneva yesterday saying that the \"filtration\" centres where captured Chechens are held are \"concentration camps where Russian soldiers are committing the worst atrocities, in all impunity, against their prisoners\".</p> <p>Moscow has backpedalled on reported pledges to allow independent scrutiny of conditions in Grozny and in the camps. Sergei Yastrzhembsky, the Kremlin's main spokesman on the war, said Grozny - which once had a population of 400,000 and was by far the biggest city in the region - was being closed to civilians for security reasons.</p> <p>\"No date has yet been set for admitting civilians back into the city,\" Mr Yastrzhembsky said, contending that the main reason for restricting access to Grozny was \"to prevent the possible deaths of civilians upon returning to the city\".</p> <p>But Russian military officers told the Interfax news agency that denying access to Grozny residents was to prevent guer rilla fighters from infiltrating their way back into the ruins in order to stage ambushes against the garrisoned Russian troops.</p> <p>It is unclear what will happen to the thousands of civilians still in Grozny, most of them elderly and ethnic Russians rather than Chechens, who are eking out a wretched existence among the rubble.</p> <p>The Russians may evacuate remaining residents forcibly to refugee camps, though having survived almost six months of unremitting Russian bombardment already, many are reluctant to abandon their destroyed homes.</p> <p>Nikolai Koshman, who is the Kremlin's political administrator for occupied Chechnya and the official charged with overseeing the reconstruction effort, said this week that Grozny \"must have the status of a closed city\".</p> <p>He made it plain that Moscow had no intention of rebuilding the city its forces have been attacking since last October, the second bombardment in five years.</p> <p>Since last year Mr Koshman has been drafting plans to close Grozny as the Chechen capital, transferring the regional seat of power to the much smaller town of Gudermes, to the east.</p> <p>Grozny - which is a Russian name rather than a Chechen one, meaning terrible or awesome - was built by the tsarist empire in the early 19th cen tury as a regional oil centre.</p> <p>The Russian forces were humiliated there by Chechen rebels during the last war in 1996 and the shattered city now stands as unwelcome testimony to the brute force deployed by the Russians to try to tame the separatists. The degree of destruction means that many of the buildings are structurally unsound and will need to be demolished.</p> <p>Mr Yastrzhembsky said Russian government \"funeral teams\" were scouring the ruins \"looking for human remains ...

      "bodyText": "Russian forces are to start sealing off the Chechen capital today in the latest attempt to stamp their authority indelibly on the rebel republic at the expense of thousands of civilians who have been uprooted from the destroyed city. While streams of refugees wend their way back to Grozny to discover the fate of their houses and belongings, Russian officers signalled that the city was to be made a no-go area indefinitely and that no one would be allowed to return home. There were also growing reports of Russian abuse, rape, torture and executions of civilians and suspected guerrillas. The World Organisation Against Torture issued a statement in Geneva yesterday saying that the \"filtration\" centres where captured Chechens are held are \"concentration camps where Russian soldiers are committing the worst atrocities, in all impunity, against their prisoners\". Moscow has backpedalled on reported pledges to allow independent scrutiny of conditions in Grozny and in the camps. Sergei Yastrzhembsky, the Kremlin's main spokesman on the war, said Grozny - which once had a population of 400,000 and was by far the biggest city in the region - was being closed to civilians for security reasons. \"No date has yet been set for admitting civilians back into the city,\" Mr Yastrzhembsky said, contending that the main reason for restricting access to Grozny was \"to prevent the possible deaths of civilians upon returning to the city\". But Russian military officers told the Interfax news agency that denying access to Grozny residents was to prevent guer rilla fighters from infiltrating their way back into the ruins in order to stage ambushes against the garrisoned Russian troops. It is unclear what will happen to the thousands of civilians still in Grozny, most of them elderly and ethnic Russians rather than Chechens, who are eking out a wretched existence among the rubble. The Russians may evacuate remaining residents forcibly to refugee camps, though having survived almost six months of unremitting Russian bombardment already, many are reluctant to abandon their destroyed homes. Nikolai Koshman, who is the Kremlin's political administrator for occupied Chechnya and the official charged with overseeing the reconstruction effort, said this week that Grozny \"must have the status of a closed city\". He made it plain that Moscow had no intention of rebuilding the city its forces have been attacking since last October, the second bombardment in five years. Since last year Mr Koshman has been drafting plans to close Grozny as the Chechen capital, transferring the regional seat of power to the much smaller town of Gudermes, to the east. Grozny - which is a Russian name rather than a Chechen one, meaning terrible or awesome - was built by the tsarist empire in the early 19th cen tury as a regional oil centre. The Russian forces were humiliated there by Chechen rebels during the last war in 1996 and the shattered city now stands as unwelcome testimony to the brute force deployed by the Russians to try to tame the separatists. The degree of destruction means that many of the buildings are structurally unsound and will need to be demolished. Mr Yastrzhembsky said Russian government \"funeral teams\" were scouring the ruins \"looking for human remains ... That is also part of the effort to clean up Grozny.\" The Russians also say that the thousands of rebel fighters who fled the city two weeks ago, seeking refuge in the southern highlands of Chechnya, mined and booby-trapped Grozny before leaving. The Russians have 500 sappers in Grozny clearing roads and buildings of mines. They also say there are still about 300 guerrillas lying low, ready to stage ambushes. The prospect of outside observers checking the veracity of the Russian claims evaporated yesterday, despite the statement hours earlier from Lord Robertson, the Nato secretary-general, who said that the Kremlin had agreed to allow in independent investigators. Following talks with acting president, Vladimir Putin, on Wednesday, Lord Robertson said: \"The president will be appointing an ombudsman, an international person of authority, who will look into complaints of human rights abuses in Chechnya.\" But Moscow is denying access to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and has just refused to allow Mary Robinson, the United Nations human rights rapporteur, to visit the region or to send an envoy. The ICRC declines to comment publicly on its findings of humanitarian abuse, but Mrs Robinson cited the ICRC as reporting that tens of thousands of civilians in Grozny had been left without water, food, power and medical care. \"Civilians faced 'a catastrophic situation',\" she said, while Russian forces were violating the Geneva conventions governing conduct in war.",

      "bodyText": "Scotland's first minister, Donald Dewar, yesterday moved to allay fears that the prosecution of the Lockerbie bomb suspects was in disarray by quickly nominating a replacement for the man who had been due to lead the prosecution team. In less than six weeks, Lord Hardie, the lord advocate, Scotland's senior law officer, was supposed to lead the prosecution against the two Libyan suspects at Kamp van Zeist, in the Netherlands. But he quit late on Wednesday - and appointed himself a judge. The move prompted accusations that Lord Hardie had left the families of the Lockerbie victims in the lurch, and led opposition politicians to call for an immediate review of the way judges are appointed, particularly the notion of self-appointment. During an angry exchange at first minister's questions, the Scottish National party leader, Alex Salmond, accused Lord Hardie of letting Scotland down in the eyes of the world. Mr Dewar dismissed this as \"over-dramatic\". By yesterday morning there was growing concern north of the border that Lord Hardie's decision would leave a vacuum at the heart of the case against the Libyan suspects. The Scottish executive denied the departure would affect the trial and Mr Dewar announced he was recommending to the Queen that Colin Boyd, the solicitor general for Scotland, should become the new lord advocate. Mr Boyd has played a prominent role in the Lockerbie case, appearing in person for the prosecution at some of the pre-trial hearings in Edinburgh and the Netherlands. Roseanna Cunningham, the shadow justice minister, said many people felt let down by Lord Hardie's departure. \"He has been responsible for key decisions in the Lockerbie prosecution, and the least he could have done was see this very important trial through to a close,\" she said. Families of those who lost their lives in the Lockerbie bombing said they were appalled by Lord Hardie's decision. Susan Cohen, from New Jersey, in the US, who lost her daughter Theodora, said: \"I am appalled and amazed at a moment like this, that the lord advocate just decides to leave.\" Lord Hardie recently came under fire over his role in the appointment of Scottish judges after a high court ruling that using temporary sheriffs was in breach of the European convention on human rights. After the SNP claimed Lord Hardie had mishandled the incorporation of the convention into Scots law, the Scottish justice minister, Jim Wallace, gave Lord Hardie his backing.",

      "bodyText": "The maverick Tory MP, Teresa Gorman, is facing one of Parliament's most serious punishments - a one-month suspension from the Commons - for repeatedly covering up her substantial business interests from scrutiny by MPs or the public. A report published yesterday by the Commons standards and privileges committee said that she \"intended to deceive\" parliament's senior watchdog body over her ownership of properties in south London and Portugal which were hidden in offshore trusts. She is also accused of contempt of the House of Commons and of abusing \"her position as an MP\" to smear accusers who gave evidence against her. Yesterday Mrs Gorman, recently barred by her own party from the shortlist for London mayoral candidate, said: \"I totally reject the findings of the committee.

Try complaining about their inappropriate behaviour in house and if the result wasn't the routine thick ear for being a \"lying little tyke\", it was just as likely to be a fumble up the trouser leg. Abuse was classless, perpetrators ranging from those already mentioned to the boilerman. And that's the problem - their present day equivalents are still out there and are extremely difficult to spot. Child abuse is an activity we need to contain and if the word contain is construed as offensive, then I make no apology. Whatever various agencies claim, this evil, like war, is here to stay. Brian C Thomas Bexhill-on-Sea \u0095 It is quite astonishing to find how weak the Waterhouse recommendations appear to be with regard to staff training, ie not even a proposal for a programme of professional training for all staff. Residential child care staff face one of the hardest jobs in the social care spectrum but with one of the lowest proportions of appropriately qualified staff. Aside from the NVQ vocational framework, which has been very patchy in its take-up and completion rates, there is almost nothing available for residential staff who want to pursue qualifying training.

The city was emptied of most of its Kosovan Albanians last year. They were forced into refugee columns like the inhabitants of the rest of Kosovo. After his defeat in June, and sensing a chance to save something from the wreckage, Milosevic hoped to preserve Mitrovica, at least in part. Its closeness to Serbia made it strategically significant. The zinc and gold mines which adjoin it were top of the list of Kosovo's economic assets. Serb civilians moved quickly into Albanian flats. Serb vigilantes reinforced the bridges to prevent most Alba nians coming home. Their policy had a logic, to which the Albanians contributed.

It could accept the Milosevic design or make it clear it would not tolerate partition, whatever humanitarian justification it might seem to have as a protective measure. The latter course would have meant flooding the northern part with troops and moving decisively to disarm the Serbs while also resisting Albanian revenge attacks. But, like Nato's war strategy, Kfor's peacetime policy has been excessively wary of risking its own troops' lives. It was also coloured by the fact that Mitrovica falls into the French-commanded sector of Kosovo. \"Go back to Beirut in the early 1980s. The French philosophy of peacekeeping is to establish a 'green line' between the Christians and the Muslims and then just hold it,\" a British officer commented recently.</p> <p>The French said their policy was temporary, but as the months went by despair and frustration grew in the Albanian community. Suspicion also developed that western governments wanted the threat of permanent partition as a device to stop Albanians from pushing for Kosovo's independence. Meanwhile, Serb hardliners hatched new plans. Two weeks ago they mounted attacks on the remaining Albanians in the north. At least 10 people died as gangs went from flat to flat, smashing front doors, throwing grenades, and firing at short range. It was a vicious racial pogrom, but the French troops' initial response was so weak that several UN policemen in Mitrovica, in particular a group of American officers, denounced it to reporters.</p> <p>Many Albanians gave up. Close to a thousand fled the northern part of the city. Anger boiled over among the more militant who stayed behind in an enclave in the north known as Little Bosnia. They took their guns from under their beds and started firing, partly in self-defence against a new wave of Serb paramilitary grenade attacks, and partly - for the first time - at Kfor.</p> <p>The situation is dire, but not yet irreparable. Beefed up by British, German, and Belgian troops, French soldiers have gone in to disarm the Albanians in the north. What they must also do is to go into Serb flats and conduct the weapons searches which they should have made long ago. They should help the Albanian refugees return before their flats are looted and burnt. They must warn off or detain the Serb paramilitaries. Mitrovica's division is not the solution. It is the problem, and unless it is reversed now, there may not be another chance.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In the light of his medical report Jack Straw had no option but to excuse Augusto Pinochet extradition to Spain. No option, that is, once he had decided that he rather than the Spanish should gauge Pinochet's fitness to stand. The sooner Pinochet is stretchered off to Brize Norton and put on a plane to Chile, the better. Of course it is open to human rights groups to continue challenging the home secretary in the courts. (It is hard to see how the Spanish, Belgian and other governments can complain, since they would also have had to assess Pinochet's fitness.) But if the case gets to the law lords, how could they conclude other than in Mr Straw's favour? To reject such a clear statement of opinion and fact by doctors would itself be unreasonable. Consultants are far from infallible. But in the light of the professional finding of \"extensive damage to the brain\", Amnesty and other potential appellants run the risk of painting themselves as vindictive and so damaging their moral standing. The principle in the Pinochet case bears repeating. Human rights offences committed in one country have been made the subject of effective legal action in others and will be again.

The South African president, Thabo Mbeki, told the commission president, Romano Prodi, that his government had bowed to an attempt by Italy and Greece to protect their famous grape skin and aniseed-flavoured spirits. Several EU governments, including Britain, publicly criticised Rome and Athens for making an issue over the brand names. Ouzo is not even manufactured in South Africa and only 30,000 bottles of grappa are produced there each year. \"This has honestly been the EU at its very worst,\" said one diplomat. \"Petty, small-minded and mean.\" The long-delayed agreement phases out the use of the terms \"grappa\" and \"ouzo\" over five years in a dispute that the South African trade minister, Alec Erwin, called \"bizarre\". Disagreement over the names held up implementa tion of a landmark South Africa-EU trade deal that was finally concluded last year after four years of tortuous negotiations. In June 1998 Britain invited the then South African president, Nelson Mandela, to the EU summit in Cardiff to sign the accord, but it was not concluded. The free trade agreement was supposed to come into effect on January 1, but the disagreement over wines and spirits jeopardised the overall deal, which will remove tariffs on 90% of two-way trade over a 12-year period. The EU's failure to ratify the agreement provoked irritation in South Africa, which accused the Europeans of reneging on pledges to help rebuild their economy after the end of apartheid in 1994. But the Europeans had long demanded that South Africa respect \"traditional expressions\" of their liquors. Under the wine and spirits agreement, South Africa's wine industry was already forced to stop labelling wines as \"sherry\" or \"port\" following pressure from Spain and Portugal. Italy and Greece then jumped on the bandwagon.",

But the McCain staff was hopeful that Wednesday's surprise endorsement by Gary Bauer, a religious conservative and former Republican presidential contender, would help the senator among voters on the right while he continues to woo the cross-over vote. And the McCain campaign was also encouraged by a Gallup poll, which showed that while Mr Bush had a five-point lead over the Democratic frontrunner, the vice-president, Al Gore, Mr McCain led Mr Gore by 16 points, reflecting his cross-over appeal.

In addition, it is well-known that rape and sexual assault are vastly under-reported crimes.</p> <p>Studies have estimated that only between 10% and 25% of women who say they have been raped reported the offence to the police.</p> <p>It also shows that rape is committed mainly by younger men.</p> <p>The estimate of the true extent of sexual crime is born out by the British Crime Survey, which asks people about their experience of crime rather than relying on offences reported to the police. It confirms that the police crime represents only the tip of the iceberg for all sorts of offences.</p> <p>The 1996 British Crime Survey reported that 4% of women said they had been physically attacked by a current or former partner in the previous year.</p> <p>It also reported that 23% of all women said they had been assaulted by a current or former partner at some time in their lives.</p>",

The home office study also shows that the number of attacks by parental figures, former boyfriends or acquaintances and date rapes have increased throughout the 1990s. Acquaintance rapes account for about 43% of all such attacks, with half involving somebody with whom the victim has known for less than 24 hours. At the same time there has been a sharp fall in the number of rapes reported to the police which involve strangers; these now accounts for 12% of all attacks. The research was published as the government announced a new \u00a36m package of grants for projects around the country aimed at improving the dismal conviction rates for rape and giving better protection to women who are repeatedly beaten by their partners. It is to be followed by a three-year \u00a314m publicity campaign aimed at ensuring that everybody in Britain is aware of the realities of domestic violence. Margaret Jay, the minister for women, last night said it was unacceptable that a quarter of all women would experience domestic violence at some stage in their lives and that many more women were so scared of rape or sexual assault that they were frightened to leave their homes. \"Women have a right to live their lives without violence or fear of violence,\" she added. \"It can have a devastating impact not only on the women themselves but their families too.\" Home office ministers say that too many cases for rape and sexual assault fall through or are dropped by the crown prosecution service. Hospitals and GPs will be expected to work with the police to gather evidence of physical injuries, to secure a better conviction rate when cases come to court. Ministers also want schools to teach pupils on the realities of domestic violence as part of lessons about relationships, sex and parenting. The home office research published yesterday says that the number of cases of rape and indecent assault recorded by the police is 33% fewer than the number of such crimes that women reported to them. In addition, it is well-known that rape and sexual assault are vastly under-reported crimes. Studies have estimated that only between 10% and 25% of women who say they have been raped reported the offence to the police. It also shows that rape is committed mainly by younger men. The estimate of the true extent of sexual crime is born out by the British Crime Survey, which asks people about their experience of crime rather than relying on offences reported to the police. It confirms that the police crime represents only the tip of the iceberg for all sorts of offences. The 1996 British Crime Survey reported that 4% of women said they had been physically attacked by a current or former partner in the previous year. It also reported that 23% of all women said they had been assaulted by a current or former partner at some time in their lives.",

The 32 genito-urinary medicine clinics in the Thames region treated 47% of all male and 40% of all female infections in England and Wales, and 58% of all homosexually-acquired gonorrhoea infection. The researchers have been monitoring the incidence of the disease at 13 of these clinics. Dr Ison said she and her colleagues had no easy explanation for the rise in gonorrhoea. \"We don't have an answer to that,\" she said. \"We know that the dramatic decline after the advent of Aids has been arrested and sustained over a three-year period.\" Since gonorrhoea is solely passed on through sexual intercourse, \"there must be unprotected sex going on,\" she said. But it was also possible that the organism that causes the infection had become more virulent, more transmissible or better adapted to survive. The researchers had been surprised to find that the increase in gonorrhoea was in every age group and sexual orientation. The 1992 Health of the Nation document set targets for reducing gonorrhoea, but these were met almost before it was published. Fear of Aids and campaigns for safe sex seem to have been the reason for a steep decline in gonorrhoea in the early 1990s. But there will be fears that complacency over Aids is leading to dangerously casual attitudes to condom use. The government is expected to attempt to tackle this when it launches its sexual health strategy later this year.",

The report by the national audit office - kept secret for five years - shows how MI5 and MI6, in league with the cabinet secretary, the treasury, and Whitehall's property services agency, kept ministers in the dark about the enormous increases in the cost of the two buildings. It makes clear that secrecy surrounding the projects was used to cover up incompetence rather than genuine security needs. Thames House, MI5's headquarters in central London, and Vauxhall Cross, the headquarters of MI6 across the river, together cost \u00a3547m, more than twice the estimate. When ministers baulked at the rising costs after they were eventually told, MI5 and MI6 claimed that without the extra money their activities and the safety of their staff would be put at risk. Parliamentary and treasury rules were secretly broken with officials agreeing to pay property developers and consultants in advance. MI6 bought Vauxhall Cross - a stunning Terry Farrel-designed building on the river -before a brick was laid. MI5 bought Thames House, a listed Edwardian building on Millbank originally owned by ICI. They occupied the buildings in 1994, six years later. The audit report says the trouble started when \"heroic assumptions\" were made about the cost of the buildings and the design of the interiors, not least because they did not take into account special MI5 and MI6 requirements.

The audit report shows that MI5 spent more than \u00a3200m, four times the estimate, refurbishing Thames House and MI6 spent \u00a375m, more than three times the first estimates, fitting up its headquarters.

The upper pump room of the spa, which nestles on the lower slopes of Ben Wyvis, will be used to tell the story of the spa and it is hoped that modern tourists will be attracted by the tales of trainloads of Victorians searching for mythical medical elixirs. The spa became a popular resort after a certain Thomas Morrison declared in 1819 that its spring waters were \"the most efficacious in the Britain\". His claims for the foul-tasting sulphurous and iron-rich waters were backed by Thomas Thomson of Glasgow university, who said they contained more hydrogen than the waters of Harrogate, in Yorkshire. Within decades, hospitals, hotels and villas had grown up around the spa as ailing Victorians sought help for their gout and scurvy in the pungent waters and balsamic air.

The boy, from Bristol, was on his first walking expedition with the Scouts last October when he and 11 others aged up to 15 were taken on a descent of the 3,560ft mountain that was \"entirely unsuitable\" for such a group, the inquest had heard.

After lunch, Scout leader Peter Finlay showed the boys the chosen route down across scree, rocks and boulders, joining later with an easier path.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair is personally to take charge of a wide-ranging government review of adoption law in a drive to speed up the adoption process in the wake of the child abuse scandal in Welsh care homes. The prime minister, keen to be seen to be acting swiftly to respond to concerns over the plight of some children in care, believes too many hurdles are placed in the way of couples wanting to adopt, leaving children to spend needless lengths of time in care. He will chair a committee comprising the home secretary, Jack Straw, the health secretary, Alan Milburn, and the Welsh secretary, Paul Murphy, to examine the role of adoption in easing the problem, Downing Street said yesterday. The review was welcomed yesterday by adoption bodies and social services leaders, but all warned against removing crucial checks on prospective adoptive parents. Strict vetting procedures were specifically designed to weed out \"people who are capable of perpetrating some of the evil abuse we have seen described in the Waterhouse report [on the Welsh scandal],\" the Association of Directors of Social Services said last night. Felicity Collier, director of the British Agencies for Adoption and Fostering, praised moves to overhaul outdated adoption law, but pointed to statistics showing that only a minority of the 53,000 children in care in England are awaiting adoption, while thousands stay only briefly in care before returning to their families. There were concerns last night among some in social services that behind the Downing Street announcement lies a furious row between the department of health and the home office over the way forward on adop tion. The DoH, which stresses that many children in care are not awaiting adoption, argues that steps already under way will ease the adoption process without compromising vetting measures, while Mr Straw is an advocate of more widespread and swifter adoption, and has called for more adoption of babies born to young mothers. With the intervention of Mr Blair, who believes children are \"best brought up in a stable relationship by a loving mother and father\", it appears the home office approach has emerged victorious. Mr Blair's review will lead to the publication of a consultation document before any new laws are introduced. The prime minister's official spokesman pointed to an average wait of five years before adoption proceedings were completed for children over five years of age, and an average wait of eight months for newborn infants. Adoption rates vary widely between social services departments, with some placing 31% of childen in care while for others the proportion is just 2%. \"Real hurdles are put in the way of couples who want to adopt,\" Mr Blair's spokesman said, disclosing that some authorities have to pay \"transfer fees\" of up to \u00a312,000 to other authorities who recruit suitable adoptive parents. There are also concerns that some departments are too dogmatic over ensuring a race or gender match between children and adoptive families. Mr Blair has been told by officials that the number of adoptions each year has fallen from 20,000 in the 1960s and 1970s to about 6,000 per year - with half of those involving the child's own parent, or step-parent. Adoption agencies and the DoH point out that the profile of children in care has changed radically since the 1960s, with the number of babies in care now far lower as the stigma of illegitimacy diminishes, and a consequent surplus of would-be adoptive parents. The average age of children in care is over 10, more than 40% are aged 10-15 and fewer than 20% are aged under five.",

The plan would double the size of the gardens - the last surviving open ground from the 1951 Festival of Britain site - which would be terraced over the new buildings, planted with mature trees, and modelled to include a 2,000-seater grass amphitheatre with stunning river views. The redevelopment proposal covers the entire length of the 30 acre site, from County Hall to Waterloo Bridge. The London Eye, now expected to dominate the site for the next half century, is given pride of place in the computer graphics of the scheme. The master plan was created by the American architect Rick Mather. It is the third attempt in the last decade to resolve the problem of the South Bank arts complex. The site already attracts 3.5m visitors a year, not counting the National Theatre, which is not included in the plan, or the wheel, expected to sell at least 2m tickets this year. However, local residents dismissed the plan as a \"con\". \"Sticking a bit of grass on a roof is not preserving public open space, it's just providing a glamorous forecourt for a commercial development,\" said Emma Winkley, of the Waterloo Community Development Group. The new Jubilee Gardens would be the start of a phased development retaining most of the present buildings and adding two new tall narrow \"blade blocks\", including residential and commercial units, which would help pay for the scheme. The scheme would provide new homes for the British Film Institutute's cinemas and the Museum of the Moving Image, which temporarily closed last year, a new 1,500-seater classical music hall, a new flexible hall for amplified music and chamber opera, possibly to be created by demolishing the Queen Elizabeth Hall, and refurbishment of the Royal Festival Hall. Service roads would be ban ished to one side, and a \"high street\" of shops and cafes created behind . The Hayward Gallery would survive, but like all the other buildings would be remodelled to have its entrance at ground level. Architectural competitions will be held to design individual buildings. The South Bank chairman, Elliott Bernerd, refused to cost the scheme, but since refurbishment of the Festival Hall alone will cost up to \u00a350m, the total cost will certainly be over \u00a3200m. Mr Bernerd said negotiations were in progress on public and private funding, but added: \"We will certainly be rattling collection boxes.\" The Arts Council has earmarked \u00a325m for \"an application of appropriate quality\" and the heritage lottery scheme has promised \u00a312.5m towards the Festival Hall.

      "bodyText": "The search for 28 \"missing\" people named in the Waterhouse children's homes report was nearing an end last night as a row blew up over government claims that it was pumping new money into children's social services. The deadline passed at 5pm yesterday for local authorities and children's charities to check whether any of their past or present workers are among those identified in the report. The list of former carers, teachers and residential staff - including some who are still considered a possible risk to children - was circulated by the department of health to 700 concerned agencies on Tuesday after the government ordered an urgent search. As the hunt went on yesterday, a political storm erupted over the government's response to the Waterhouse report, with the Tories accusing ministers of \"outrageous deceit\" in re-announcing social services spending as \"new money\" to tackle children's social services. Questioned about the report on Wednesday, the health minister John Hutton said almost \u00a3400m of \"new money\" was going into improving care. In fact, the money - part of the government's three-year Quality Protects programme to boost services for children at risk or in care - was announced in September 1998 and began to come on stream last April. The department of health last night insisted the money was \"new under this government\", but the Tories accused Mr Hutton of misrepresenting the funding and said the government was guilty of \"fundamental dishonesty\". The Waterhouse report catalogued stories of abuse from 240 former residents of 40 children's homes in north Wales over 20 years. In a separate case, an 82-year-old former employee of a West Midlands children's home was yesterday charged with seven counts of indecent assault against children resident in the home. West Midlands police and social services are investigating claims that 14 staff were involved in physical and sexual abuse of boys at the Tennall assessment centre near Birmingham, which closed in 1985. The alleged offences, reported by nine former residents, were said to have been committed between 1979 and 1984. Not all those named on the list of 28 \"missing\" people are convicted paedophiles; some have been convicted of physical assaults and others have not been prosecuted for any offence. Anybody on the list found to be working with children will be instantly suspended and investigated. Some people on the list are thought to have died, and at least one man is in his 70s, but fears remained that others could still be working with children. \u0095 Two senior officials at a children's home were yesterday found guilty of a string of sexual assaults on boys in their care. Former deputy principal Barrie Alden, 66, and ex-housemaster John Wright, 56, abused eight boys at the council-run Ty Mawr home, near Abergavenny, south Wales, between 1966 and 1983. Alden, from Norwich, who was found guilty of five indecent assaults, four serious sexual assaults and one gross indecency while at the home, which is now closed. There are other abuse cases under investigation. Sentencing was adjourned until today. Both were remanded in custody.",

William Hague was in Northern Ireland yesterday, and called for an immediate start to decommissioning. Mary Harney, the Irish deputy premier, also argued for movement on the arms issue soon during a visit to Londonderry; she said no one in government should be able to retain a private army.",

Paradoxically this is less of a problem for the government, since many of the seats in these areas will continue to be won, even if Labour loses a quarter of its votes. The really serious problem would arise if differential abstention were more likely to occur in Labour marginals.

In the monthly Gallup survey conducted in July 1999 voters were asked if they approved or disapproved of the government's record. Some 54% of middle-class voters approved (40% disapproved) whereas only 46% of working-class voters approved (43% disapproved). In the same survey some 51% of the voters in the south-east of England approved, but only 43% did so in the north and 42% in the north-west. To be fair these regional breakdowns are based on relatively small numbers of cases and the picture is somewhat mixed anyway, since 58% of the voters in Scotland approved.

The research on electoral turnout shows quite clearly that citizens are more willing to vote if an election is competitive. Thus the government may also suffer from the widespread perception that the Conservatives cannot win, which appears to make the next election a foregone conclusion. Unfortunately not much can be done about that perception short of Labour trying to boost William Hague.</p> <p>Local campaigns by party activists are very important in mobilising voters.

      "bodyText": "If you choose to watch Heart Of The Matter this Sunday (BBC2, 11.35pm) it will be a triumph for David Burke and the UK branch of the White Dot campaign, and simultaneously a great defeat. It will be a victory because Burke wants you to watch the short film and studio discussion, during which he argues forcefully for you to stop watching television. And it will be a defeat because for Burke to get this message across, you will have to be watching television. In fact, the only people in Britain certain not to see the programme will be those Burke has already got his message across to. They'll be out enjoying the countryside, a good book or serious conversation. In person, David Burke is as witty, persuasive and charming as his appearance on Heart Of The Matter suggests.

The proposal was described as flawed and disingenuous.</p> <p>The report said that if air traffic control (Nats) was sold to a private company, jobs would be cut, fares would rise and national security could be threatened.</p> <p>The government had failed to make a positive case for a public-private partnership, and had failed to give adequate reasons for rejecting other options, such as an independent, publicly owned organisation like the post office or a trust.</p> <p>In a conciliatory move, the transport minister, Lord Macdonald, said the government had not ruled out some options put forward by opponents of privatisation, including setting up a trust, \"but we have to reserve the right to go for any strategic partner of our choice\".</p> <p>He said that it was not possible to maintain the status quo. The government was \"on course\" to settle questions of safety, which would never be compromised. Even the civil aviation authority, responsible for air regulation, had expressed its support for the private-public partnership.</p> <p>The report said that if Nats' debt of \u00a3300m was written off by the government before the sale, the net revenue from the sale would be only \u00a320m.</p> <p>Ms Dunwoody and her colleagues were angry at the CAA's intervention. It was an economic and safety regulator, and it was not appropriate to give the impression that it backed the government's plan. If the sell-off went ahead, the committee wanted the government to ensure that no profit was made on the Nats operation.</p> <p>Sir Roy McNulty, Nats chairman, welcomed the \"clear statement\" in the report that the status quo could not continue. He had argued consistently that it must have a new structure to enable it to exploit business opportunities.</p> <p>He believed that the government's plan would maintain Nats as a world leader. He was confident that safety would remain paramount, and that the privatisation would give it all the investment it needed.</p> <p>Paul Noon, leader of the air traffic controllers' union, IPMS, said the report vindicated everything staff had been saying since the the proposal was announced.</p> <p>\"It is surely the final nail in the coffin. Air traffic control staff don't want it, pilots don't want it and the travelling public don't want it.\" The government should \"give in gracefully\" and drop the plans.</p> <p>Mr Noon is seeking a European commission ruling on whether the French or Germans could successfully bid for the company, after the treasury admitted that the government has no powers to sell off Nats to a British company with a majority shareholding. He said that if the EU ruled against the government, air traffic controllers might take the matter to the courts.</p>",

      "bodyText": "John Prescott's \u00a31bn plan to privatise air traffic control was condemned by MPs yesterday for jeopardising safety and being the \"worst possible option\". Gwyneth Dunwoody, chairwoman of the all-party transport committee, said the transport secretary should \"very sincerely think again\", as the committee's report revealed a long list of objections to the proposal, which is in transport legislation going through the Commons. The proposal was described as flawed and disingenuous. The report said that if air traffic control (Nats) was sold to a private company, jobs would be cut, fares would rise and national security could be threatened. The government had failed to make a positive case for a public-private partnership, and had failed to give adequate reasons for rejecting other options, such as an independent, publicly owned organisation like the post office or a trust. In a conciliatory move, the transport minister, Lord Macdonald, said the government had not ruled out some options put forward by opponents of privatisation, including setting up a trust, \"but we have to reserve the right to go for any strategic partner of our choice\". He said that it was not possible to maintain the status quo. The government was \"on course\" to settle questions of safety, which would never be compromised. Even the civil aviation authority, responsible for air regulation, had expressed its support for the private-public partnership. The report said that if Nats' debt of \u00a3300m was written off by the government before the sale, the net revenue from the sale would be only \u00a320m. Ms Dunwoody and her colleagues were angry at the CAA's intervention. It was an economic and safety regulator, and it was not appropriate to give the impression that it backed the government's plan. If the sell-off went ahead, the committee wanted the government to ensure that no profit was made on the Nats operation. Sir Roy McNulty, Nats chairman, welcomed the \"clear statement\" in the report that the status quo could not continue. He had argued consistently that it must have a new structure to enable it to exploit business opportunities. He believed that the government's plan would maintain Nats as a world leader. He was confident that safety would remain paramount, and that the privatisation would give it all the investment it needed. Paul Noon, leader of the air traffic controllers' union, IPMS, said the report vindicated everything staff had been saying since the the proposal was announced. \"It is surely the final nail in the coffin. Air traffic control staff don't want it, pilots don't want it and the travelling public don't want it.\" The government should \"give in gracefully\" and drop the plans. Mr Noon is seeking a European commission ruling on whether the French or Germans could successfully bid for the company, after the treasury admitted that the government has no powers to sell off Nats to a British company with a majority shareholding. He said that if the EU ruled against the government, air traffic controllers might take the matter to the courts.",

For fear of reprisals against their families, partisans always operated under pseudonyms. Pilch took his names - Gora (mountain) and later Dolina (valley) - from the terrain around southern Poland, where he was born, in the spa town of Wisla.</p> <p>Before the war, he was set to become an architect. But with the German invasion of Poland in 1939, he fled through Hungary and Yugoslavia to fight in France, then came to England to train under Maj-Gen Sir Colin Gubbins for the special operations executive (SOE). Parachuted back into Poland in February 1943, Pilch took charge of a 40-strong group of partisans, which within two months had became 400, and, by the end of the year, had grown to 1,000.</p> <p>Their SOE-trained leaders were known as cichociemni - those who walk silently in the dark. First operating in the forests and marshes of north-east Poland, they specialised in sabotage and guerrilla warfare. But after most of their officers had been drawn into a \"friendly-talks\" trap by the Soviets, and the Russians had surrounded the partisans' camp, it was Pilch who gave the order to open fire. His unit won the day, and was thereafter known as the Doliniacy , or Dolina's Boys.</p> <p>Following the north-east campaign, the unit - now including many civilians made refugees by the Russian advance - travelled in a convoy of horses and carts towards Warsaw to prepare for the uprising. The strategic point for supplying men and weapons to the fight was based in the Kampinos forest outside the capital, and Pilch was in charge of all guerrilla activity, defending the base against the Germans. Further supplemented with more civilians, including escapees from concentration camps, the Doliniacy fought, often on horseback, against German and Soviet units.</p> <p>In all, Pilch fought in more than 200 engagements, never lost a battle, and was subsequently awarded four fighting crosses, the medal of Warsaw, the king's medal for courage, and Poland's highest military honour, the virtuti militari . He always led from the front, and cared inordinately for his men. \"His concern for his soldiers won their lasting devotion and love; we owe him our lives,\" said Anna Jablonska, a fellow-member of the underground army, now in her 70s.</p> <p>After Yalta, of course, with Poland under the Russian domination, Pilch was a hero who could not go home. Returned to England, he married a Polish girlfriend from before the war, settled in south London and made a considerable career as an inventory consultant.</p> <p>As a staunch member of the Polish Underground Army's Ex-Servicemens' Association, he also worked to secure due recognition for his comrades - especially those tortured, executed or sent to Siberian labour camps. It was not an easy task, given the regime in Poland and the corrosive revisionism of armchair Stalinists here and elsewhere. In 1990, however, on an official visit to free Poland, Pilch was welcomed by top dignitaries, the Polish army, military bands and his old soldiers.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife, Eva, and three children, Anna, Adam, Irena. Among those paying their respects at his funeral in Wandsworth were four elderly figures come specially from Poland, Dolina's Boys, holding high their underground army banner.</p> <p>Adolf Pilch, soldier, born May 22 1914; died January 26 2000</p>",

During the second world war, there was no such thing in Poland as being neutral. For fear of reprisals against their families, partisans always operated under pseudonyms. Pilch took his names - Gora (mountain) and later Dolina (valley) - from the terrain around southern Poland, where he was born, in the spa town of Wisla. Before the war, he was set to become an architect. But with the German invasion of Poland in 1939, he fled through Hungary and Yugoslavia to fight in France, then came to England to train under Maj-Gen Sir Colin Gubbins for the special operations executive (SOE). Parachuted back into Poland in February 1943, Pilch took charge of a 40-strong group of partisans, which within two months had became 400, and, by the end of the year, had grown to 1,000. Their SOE-trained leaders were known as cichociemni - those who walk silently in the dark. First operating in the forests and marshes of north-east Poland, they specialised in sabotage and guerrilla warfare. But after most of their officers had been drawn into a \"friendly-talks\" trap by the Soviets, and the Russians had surrounded the partisans' camp, it was Pilch who gave the order to open fire. His unit won the day, and was thereafter known as the Doliniacy , or Dolina's Boys. Following the north-east campaign, the unit - now including many civilians made refugees by the Russian advance - travelled in a convoy of horses and carts towards Warsaw to prepare for the uprising. The strategic point for supplying men and weapons to the fight was based in the Kampinos forest outside the capital, and Pilch was in charge of all guerrilla activity, defending the base against the Germans. Further supplemented with more civilians, including escapees from concentration camps, the Doliniacy fought, often on horseback, against German and Soviet units. In all, Pilch fought in more than 200 engagements, never lost a battle, and was subsequently awarded four fighting crosses, the medal of Warsaw, the king's medal for courage, and Poland's highest military honour, the virtuti militari . He always led from the front, and cared inordinately for his men. \"His concern for his soldiers won their lasting devotion and love; we owe him our lives,\" said Anna Jablonska, a fellow-member of the underground army, now in her 70s. After Yalta, of course, with Poland under the Russian domination, Pilch was a hero who could not go home. Returned to England, he married a Polish girlfriend from before the war, settled in south London and made a considerable career as an inventory consultant. As a staunch member of the Polish Underground Army's Ex-Servicemens' Association, he also worked to secure due recognition for his comrades - especially those tortured, executed or sent to Siberian labour camps. It was not an easy task, given the regime in Poland and the corrosive revisionism of armchair Stalinists here and elsewhere. In 1990, however, on an official visit to free Poland, Pilch was welcomed by top dignitaries, the Polish army, military bands and his old soldiers. He is survived by his wife, Eva, and three children, Anna, Adam, Irena. Among those paying their respects at his funeral in Wandsworth were four elderly figures come specially from Poland, Dolina's Boys, holding high their underground army banner. Adolf Pilch, soldier, born May 22 1914; died January 26 2000",

The Chittagong-based Janakantha daily newspaper reported that some of the victims' relatives had attributed the deaths to heart attacks, fearing that otherwise a Muslim burial would be denied. According to news reports, at least 70 people had fallen ill after drinking crudely distilled alcohol, which they reportedly bought from two health stores in the town. However, only 30 of the victims were taken to hospital; one doctor said the death toll could have been lower if treatment had been given faster.

      "bodyText": "An emotional Kofi Annan was greeted with cheers and tears when he arrived in East Timor yesterday, laying a wreath at a Roman Catholic church where dozens of people were massacred last year. The UN secretary-general and his wife, Nane, shed tears as he laid the wreath in the town of Liquica, about 20 miles west of the capital, Dili. Some of East Timor's worst bloodshed occurred in the town before and after the territory voted on August 30 for independence from Indonesia. Across East Timor local militias backed by the Indonesian army terrorised the majority favouring independence. A crowd of 5,000 cheered Mr Annan's arrival for the ceremony. \"It is particularly shocking to me that a house of worship should be desecrated in this manner,\" he told them. \"I know that many more of your relatives and friends lost their lives before and after the ballot. I have only begun to see for myself how extensive the destruction was here in Liquica.\" He urged Indonesia to ensure those responsible for the violence be brought to justice.",

Dr George Carey said the appointment of Chuck Murphy and John Rodgers to bishoprics within the US by the archbishops of Rwanda and south-east Asia breached Anglican rules and was illegal. The row over the ordination last month of the two men, who are both prominent evangelicals, threatens to tear apart the US Episcopal church, which has 2.5m members. During a presidential election year in which issues such as abortion are expected to be high on the political agenda, infighting between conservatives and liberals in the American equivalent of the Church of England would be a disaster for Anglicans worldwide and could expose rifts elsewhere. The rebel bishops have openly attacked the US church's liberalism under such controversial leaders as the recently retired bishop of Newark, Jack Spong. They are particularly upset about the practice in some areas of consecrating same-sex marriages and ordaining openly gay priests. Even their closest colleagues were unaware of the rebels' plans to travel to Singapore for the cathedral ceremony. In a letter last night to bishops across the world, Dr Carey, who is president of the 70m-strong Anglican communion, claimed the appointments broke traditions of religious authority stretching back 1,800 years. \"I cannot recognise their episcopal ministry until such time as a full rapprochement and reconciliation has taken place between them and the appropriate authorities... The understanding of episcopal ministry, which appears to have allowed them to act unilaterally, without consultation, and in secret, is quite foreign to the Anglican tradition,\" he said.

      "bodyText": "'Stay away from Pakistan' The Indian prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, warned the US president Bill Clinton yesterday against visiting Pakistan next month during his planned tour of south Asia. In the French daily, Le Figaro, Mr Vajpayee conceded that Mr Clinton had the right to stop in Pakistan during his trip to India and Bangladesh. \"But a visit to Pakistan while this country is under military dictatorship and sponsors Islamic terrorism around the world would be very badly received by Indian public opinion,\" he said. Reuters, Paris Cars ablaze in US plane crash A cargo plane plunged into a car scrapyard in California, killing three crew members and leaving a 400m trail of burning debris. The pilot of the Emery Worldwide flight reported that the DC-8's balance was affected when its cargo shifted shortly after take- off. Up to 200 cars - many with petrol in their tanks - were set alight when the plane crashed as it attempted an emergency landing near Sacramento. AP, Rancho Cordova, California Taxi drivers on the rampage Taxi drivers smashed windscreens and pulled passengers from vehicles in South Africa yesterday in a protest against planned reforms to their industry. The drivers caused huge jams in Johannesburg during the demonstration against President Thabo Mbeki's plan to force independent operators to trade in about 126,000 ageing minibuses for 85,000 larger, purpose-built buses. Hundreds die in taxi crashes every year and about 1,500 have been killed in wars over the best routes. Reuters, Johannesburg. Mongolia hit by livestock crisis The Mongolian government asked foreign embassies for emergency aid after unusually heavy snows and bitter cold killed at least 626,000 livestock animals. Millions more cattle, horses, sheep, goats, yaks and camels are in danger of starving due to lack of fodder, according to officials at the state emergency commission. AP, Ulan Bator",

WPP chief executive Martin Sorrell yesterday said the rash of web-based businesses swamping traditional media accounted for a significant part of the 5%-6% growth experienced by the global advertising industry in 1999. Recent estimates suggested that dot.com companies spent $8bn building their brands in the US alone last year. \"These are substantial numbers,\" Mr Sorrell said. \"Although the percentage of the entire market is still relatively low it does account for a significant amount of the growth. In the next year I expect to see a shift from spend on the consumer market to business-to-business.\" He said more narrowly defined internet revenues earned from advising online companies on their web marketing strategies were $100m, up from $60m a year ago. That figure is expected to grow 50% this year but the company added it would become increasingly difficult to strip out a pure internet figure because of the strategic importance of the web to the group's largest clients, Ford, IBM and Unilever. WPP, which owns the J Walter Thompson and Ogilvy &amp; Mather advertising networks, reported a 13% rise in revenues for 1999 of \u00a32.2bn with pre-tax profits 20% ahead at \u00a3255m at the top end of expectations. The company also said it planned to buy back up to \u00a3100m worth of its own shares but that failed to underpin the stock which fell 125p to \u00a310.29. Analysts said investors were locking in profits after a performance which saw the shares double in value in the past four months. Mr Sorrell forecast that the continued upwards trend in the cost of television airtime, which he said was rising at up to 10% per annum, would continue to drive marketing budgets into other media. \"The pricing of advertising on network TV by an oligopoly of media owners continues to grow faster than inflation while at the same time audiences are declining,\" he said. \"This is not a warning or a threat but a statement of fact.

      "body": "<p>As metaphors go, it's useful. A pile-driver is pummelling a piece of steel into the river beneath Hungerford footbridge on London's South Bank. The noise is so loud that lunchtime joggers cover their ears as they pass, and an elderly couple look on as the metal foundations of a new bridge are slowly sunk. The area had better get used to the pandemonium because, if the plan for the regeneration of the area unveiled yesterday goes ahead, the next decade will be as much about construction as concert-going. </p> <p>It will, however, all be worth it if the plan, masterminded by the US-born architect Rick Mather, works. The South Bank is a shambles at the moment: walkways that lead nowhere, underground areas that even the drunks seem to think beneath them, gravel car parks, metal fences, brutalist facades. The National Film Theatre is tatty; the Hayward Gallery hard to find; the Queen Elizabeth Hall unloved; the spaces that supposedly connect them a disgrace. </p> <p>It has been a shambles for a long time and architects have been trying to address the problem for almost 20 years. Terry Farrell spent a decade wrestling with a regeneration plan that was eventually sucked into the mire of political intrigue and planning argument that bedevils the site, the largest arts complex in the world. Richard Rogers's famous \"glass wave\" roof went the same way, deemed too expensive. </p> <p>Lessons were learned from the Rogers debacle and the scheme announced yesterday is markedly different from Lord Rogers's bold stroke. Rather than being an architectural d\u00e9marche, Mather's is a so-called \"urban design plan\" - an idea for what the place should be rather than how it should look. </p> <p>Mather has laid down the principles that will be given form by architects following a series of competitions to design the key buildings on the 30-acre site. The South Bank's managers are desperate not to be pinned down to precise figures for the development, because it gives opponents an easy target. The issue of cost is, in any case, clouded by the degree to which the development will be self-financing - there will be a large amount of commercial development, with shops, offices, bars and restaurants. </p> <p>Mather, the urbane, eternally young 62-year-old who was made \"master planner\" for the site last year, objects to this obsession with cost. \"It's beside the point and confirms the awful generality that Britain is a nation of shopkeepers,\" he says. Mather was born in Portland, Oregon, but has lived in Britain since the mid-60s and loves London. In fact, he loves cities and his notion is to turn the South Bank into a kind of cultural mini-city. </p> <p>\"Ever since I first came to the South Bank I've imagined what I would do to improve it,\" he says, \"so it was wonderful to get the chance to try. The principles with a city are always the same: you start out with the street and with an active frontage on the street.

      "bodyText": "As metaphors go, it's useful. A pile-driver is pummelling a piece of steel into the river beneath Hungerford footbridge on London's South Bank. The noise is so loud that lunchtime joggers cover their ears as they pass, and an elderly couple look on as the metal foundations of a new bridge are slowly sunk. The area had better get used to the pandemonium because, if the plan for the regeneration of the area unveiled yesterday goes ahead, the next decade will be as much about construction as concert-going. It will, however, all be worth it if the plan, masterminded by the US-born architect Rick Mather, works. The South Bank is a shambles at the moment: walkways that lead nowhere, underground areas that even the drunks seem to think beneath them, gravel car parks, metal fences, brutalist facades. The National Film Theatre is tatty; the Hayward Gallery hard to find; the Queen Elizabeth Hall unloved; the spaces that supposedly connect them a disgrace. It has been a shambles for a long time and architects have been trying to address the problem for almost 20 years. Terry Farrell spent a decade wrestling with a regeneration plan that was eventually sucked into the mire of political intrigue and planning argument that bedevils the site, the largest arts complex in the world. Richard Rogers's famous \"glass wave\" roof went the same way, deemed too expensive. Lessons were learned from the Rogers debacle and the scheme announced yesterday is markedly different from Lord Rogers's bold stroke. Rather than being an architectural d\u00e9marche, Mather's is a so-called \"urban design plan\" - an idea for what the place should be rather than how it should look. Mather has laid down the principles that will be given form by architects following a series of competitions to design the key buildings on the 30-acre site. The South Bank's managers are desperate not to be pinned down to precise figures for the development, because it gives opponents an easy target. The issue of cost is, in any case, clouded by the degree to which the development will be self-financing - there will be a large amount of commercial development, with shops, offices, bars and restaurants. Mather, the urbane, eternally young 62-year-old who was made \"master planner\" for the site last year, objects to this obsession with cost. \"It's beside the point and confirms the awful generality that Britain is a nation of shopkeepers,\" he says. Mather was born in Portland, Oregon, but has lived in Britain since the mid-60s and loves London. In fact, he loves cities and his notion is to turn the South Bank into a kind of cultural mini-city. \"Ever since I first came to the South Bank I've imagined what I would do to improve it,\" he says, \"so it was wonderful to get the chance to try. The principles with a city are always the same: you start out with the street and with an active frontage on the street. You have a reasonable density so it's convenient for people walking and you have a variety of different types of accommodation. It has to have balance- between the centre and the ouskirts, activity and peace. \"Streets are precious and wonderful things, particularly ones with lots of people on them, and they should be nurtured and reinforced by the public face that the buildings around them present.

Cole, seen by many as the answer to England's chronic lack of subtlety and imagination in midfield, has been left in the latter group. </p> <p>Of Cole, who plays for the Under-21s on Tuesday night, Keegan later said: \"His time will come as sure as eggs are eggs. But the clock on the wall is saying that Euro 2000 is going to be a bit tight for him.\" </p> <p>Nevertheless, Keegan earlier declared: \"I would like to take four or five younger players to Euro 2000.\" But his squad will have to be ravaged by injuries on a scale comparable to the plague which afflicted Graham Taylor's party for the 1992 European Championship for those who are now below the salt to get a chance. </p> <p>Not that the wand of youth is likely to be absent from the Argentina game. Emile Heskey, the quick, powerful 22-year-old Leicester striker is set to start for the first time after winning four caps as a substitute. </p> <p>Martin O'Neill did not want Heskey to appear against Argentina four days before Leicester meet Tranmere in the Worthington Cup final but Keegan has insisted on the player's inclusion. \"If Emile Heskey wants to get into the final 22,\" the England coach explained, \"he has to be in the squad and take part in games.\" </p> <p>With injury concerns over Michael Owen and Robbie Fowler, Keegan has little time to find the most effective partner for Alan Shearer. Kevin Phillips has been tried but, despite his prolific form for Sunderland, made little impact against Belgium in October. </p> <p>Steven Gerrard, Liverpool's fast-maturing midfielder, is also in the squad, although his chances of taking part in the Argentina match have been reduced by the recurrence of the groin injury he suffered at Highbury on Sunday. If Gerrard is unable to train by Tuesday he will not be considered. </p> <p>Nevertheless, the 19-year-old Gerrard's versatility could win him a place in Keegan's final squad. Like Kieron Dyer, his potential is increased by an ability to play with equal competence in a number of positions. </p> <p>The prospect of Aston Villa's Gareth Barry celebrating his 19th birthday by winning a first full cap on Wednesday will depend in part on the England formation. Normally Barry plays on the left of Villa's back three and if Keegan stayed with a back four he might be asked to operate slightly out of position as a left-back. </p> <p>Whether or not he plays against Argentina, Barry, too, is a distinct possibility for the summer. \"His concentration has improved this season,\" said Keegan, \"and the way he uses the ball, as well his calmness, makes him stand out for me.\" </p> <p>Jason Wilcox's inclusion could be an early indicator as to how Keegan intends solving the lack of balance on the left. He is clearly toying with the idea of moving David Beckham to central midfield, which would bring in Dyer on the right. </p> <p>\u0095 The FA is to ask for the Euro 2000 final squad deadline to be put back by at least 12 hours so that any injury concerns can be addressed. </p> <p> <strong> England squad:</strong></p> <p><strong>Seaman</strong> (Arsenal) <strong> Martyn </strong> (Leeds) <strong> Wright </strong> (Ipswich) <strong> G Neville</strong> (Man Utd) <strong>P Neville </strong> (Man Utd) <strong> Barry</strong> (Aston Villa) <strong>Southgate</strong> (Aston Villa) <strong> Campbell</strong> (Tottenham) <strong> Keown </strong> (Arsenal) <strong> Ferdinand </strong> (West Ham) <strong> Beckham</strong> (Man Utd) <strong>Ince</strong> (Middlesbrough) <strong> Froggatt</strong> (Coventry) <strong> Wilcox</strong> (Leeds) <strong> Dyer</strong> (Newcastle) <strong> Gerrard </strong> (Liverpool) <strong> Parlour</strong> (Arsenal) <strong> Scholes</strong> (Man Utd) <strong> Sinclair</strong> (West Ham) <strong> Wise</strong> (Chelsea) <strong> Cole </strong> (Man Utd) <strong> Phillips (</strong> Sunderland) <strong> Heskey</strong> (Leicester) <strong> Shearer </strong> (Newcastle).</p>",

Or to put it another way, unless Joe Cole is picked against Brazil on May 27 and has an outstanding match, West Ham's highly talented 18-year-old midfielder will have to wait until the 2002 World Cup qualifiers to begin his international career. \"By the time we play Brazil I would hope to have decided on eight or nine of the team I will pick for the opening European Championship against Portugal,\" Keegan said yesterday when he announced the squad, effectively drawing a line between probables and possibles. Cole, seen by many as the answer to England's chronic lack of subtlety and imagination in midfield, has been left in the latter group. Of Cole, who plays for the Under-21s on Tuesday night, Keegan later said: \"His time will come as sure as eggs are eggs. But the clock on the wall is saying that Euro 2000 is going to be a bit tight for him.\" Nevertheless, Keegan earlier declared: \"I would like to take four or five younger players to Euro 2000.\" But his squad will have to be ravaged by injuries on a scale comparable to the plague which afflicted Graham Taylor's party for the 1992 European Championship for those who are now below the salt to get a chance. Not that the wand of youth is likely to be absent from the Argentina game. Emile Heskey, the quick, powerful 22-year-old Leicester striker is set to start for the first time after winning four caps as a substitute. Martin O'Neill did not want Heskey to appear against Argentina four days before Leicester meet Tranmere in the Worthington Cup final but Keegan has insisted on the player's inclusion. \"If Emile Heskey wants to get into the final 22,\" the England coach explained, \"he has to be in the squad and take part in games.\" With injury concerns over Michael Owen and Robbie Fowler, Keegan has little time to find the most effective partner for Alan Shearer. Kevin Phillips has been tried but, despite his prolific form for Sunderland, made little impact against Belgium in October. Steven Gerrard, Liverpool's fast-maturing midfielder, is also in the squad, although his chances of taking part in the Argentina match have been reduced by the recurrence of the groin injury he suffered at Highbury on Sunday. If Gerrard is unable to train by Tuesday he will not be considered. Nevertheless, the 19-year-old Gerrard's versatility could win him a place in Keegan's final squad. Like Kieron Dyer, his potential is increased by an ability to play with equal competence in a number of positions. The prospect of Aston Villa's Gareth Barry celebrating his 19th birthday by winning a first full cap on Wednesday will depend in part on the England formation. Normally Barry plays on the left of Villa's back three and if Keegan stayed with a back four he might be asked to operate slightly out of position as a left-back. Whether or not he plays against Argentina, Barry, too, is a distinct possibility for the summer. \"His concentration has improved this season,\" said Keegan, \"and the way he uses the ball, as well his calmness, makes him stand out for me.\" Jason Wilcox's inclusion could be an early indicator as to how Keegan intends solving the lack of balance on the left. He is clearly toying with the idea of moving David Beckham to central midfield, which would bring in Dyer on the right. \u0095 The FA is to ask for the Euro 2000 final squad deadline to be put back by at least 12 hours so that any injury concerns can be addressed. England squad: Seaman (Arsenal) Martyn (Leeds) Wright (Ipswich) G Neville (Man Utd) P Neville (Man Utd) Barry (Aston Villa) Southgate (Aston Villa) Campbell (Tottenham) Keown (Arsenal) Ferdinand (West Ham) Beckham (Man Utd) Ince (Middlesbrough) Froggatt (Coventry) Wilcox (Leeds) Dyer (Newcastle) Gerrard (Liverpool) Parlour (Arsenal) Scholes (Man Utd) Sinclair (West Ham) Wise (Chelsea) Cole (Man Utd) Phillips ( Sunderland) Heskey (Leicester) Shearer (Newcastle).",

      "body": "<p>More than \u00a32bn was added to the market value of the Halifax bank yesterday after it announced an internet insurance venture with Peter Wood, the founder of Direct Line. </p> <p>Mr Wood, who cut all ties with Direct Line three years ago, is to take a minority stake in Esure.com, which will be launched next year to sell private motor and household insurance and insurance for small businesses over the internet. The bank expects to create 500 jobs with the move. </p> <p>The 53-year-old Mr Wood, who was once the UK's highest paid director, turned the traditional car insurance market on its head - using telephones and computers instead of old fashioned insurance brokers.

      "bodyText": "More than \u00a32bn was added to the market value of the Halifax bank yesterday after it announced an internet insurance venture with Peter Wood, the founder of Direct Line. Mr Wood, who cut all ties with Direct Line three years ago, is to take a minority stake in Esure.com, which will be launched next year to sell private motor and household insurance and insurance for small businesses over the internet. The bank expects to create 500 jobs with the move. The 53-year-old Mr Wood, who was once the UK's highest paid director, turned the traditional car insurance market on its head - using telephones and computers instead of old fashioned insurance brokers. In just a few years, the characteristic little red phone had become the symbol of the country's biggest motor insurer and made him a multimillionaire. Backed by Royal Bank of Scotland, he eventually agreed a deal with the bank in 1993 for \u00a342m to end his annual bonus payments which were described as \"obscene\" by the then shadow trade secretary, Robin Cook, and which had by that time reached \u00a318m. Mr Wood intends to shake up the insurance market again - this time through the internet and Halifax, with the aim of reducing motor insurance by up to 15%. His arrival at the Halifax reunites him Jim Spowart, who founded Direct Line's telephone bank and who will today announce Halifax's new standalone banking venture, at present code-named \"greenfield.co\". Reflecting the stock market's obsession with e-commerce, the surprise announcement about Esure, a brand conjured up personally by Mr Wood, prompted a 22% rise in Halifax's shares to 552p. \"What Halifax has got right is that if you want to impress the stock market you've got to appear innovative. The substance isn't that important at present,\" said Rob Thomas, a banking analyst at Warburg Dillon Read. \"The stock market has become very polarised - you're either a winner or a loser.

Halifax chief executive James Crosby, describing his latest recruit as a mold-breaker, said: \"He has changed the structure of the British financial services market before, and with Esure we are confident that he will do so again\". Dismissing the impact of new, start-up internet companies, Mr Crosby said: \"The era when 23-year-olds set up dot.coms and made an impact has gone.
