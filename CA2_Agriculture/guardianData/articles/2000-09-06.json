Arsenal have players of high quality and we couldn't hold them, but I think tiredness was the reason for it.\" </p> <p>Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink put it more succinctly. \"Stupid\", he called it. The Dutch striker was entitled to feel piqued, since he had put his team ahead and then hit a post with a shot which would have given Chelsea a 3-1 lead. </p> <p>In the end the sheer class of Hasselbaink's compatriot, Bergkamp, left Chelsea almost grateful for a point. When he replaced Ray Parlour with 20 minutes remaining it was as if a landscape artist had come on for a painter and decorator. No disrespect to Parlour but he would never have helped set up the goal for Henry which gave Arsenal renewed hope. </p> <p>A fixture which in recent seasons has had the stability of nitro-glycerine challenged each team to last the 90 minutes with a full compliment of players and one or two Anglo-French tempers were still simmering after last Saturday's international in Paris. </p> <p>The match, however, remained refreshingly free of rancour, the only unpleasant incident occurring when Graeme Le Saux caught Lee Dixon with a tackle late and high early in the second half. The rest was fast, open and highly entertaining. </p> <p>From Arsenal's point of view much depended on how well Wenger's makeshift midfield pairing of Parlour and Gilles Grimandi coped with the task of containing Dennis Wise, Roberto Di Matteo, Gustavo Poyet and, when he went deep, Zola. Henry's pace was always likely to threaten Chelsea's central defenders but the way the game was developing it was no surprise when Arsenal fell behind. </p> <p>Panic is not usually a word associated with Wenger's defence but when Di Matteo found Poyet in space just outside the penalty area this was what happened as Martin Keown, Oleg Luzhny and Silvinho all lunged towards the tall Uruguayan. Calm as you like, Poyet laid the ball off to Hasselbaink who briskly made space before beating David Seaman with a shot inside the near post. </p> <p>As the second half began Chelsea were quickly reminded of the fragility of one-goal leads and Arsenal comebacks. Lauren surprised their defenders with an oblique run across the penalty area before turning the ball back low for Kanu to turn, shoot and hit the bar. </p> <p>A shudder ran through the stands but just before the hour Stamford Bridge relaxed as Chelsea increased their lead. This time the response of Arsenal's defenders was sluggish rather than panic-stricken as Poyet chested a free-kick from Leboeuf into the path of Zola, who despite an awkward bounce still directed a low shot inside the left-hand post. </p> <p>With nothing to lose Wenger brought on Bergkamp and Sylvain Wiltord simultaneously. \"I took a gamble in bringing on all the weapons I had on the bench,\" he explained afterwards. Vialli, on the other hand, embarked on a policy of unilateral disarmament, withdrawing Poyet, who admittedly looked injured, and Zola, who definitely looked injured - though not physically. </p> <p>The rest of the night was Arsenal's. In the 76th minute Bergkamp chested a return pass to Silvinho who sent in Henry to beat Carlo Cudicini with a cleanly hit drive, and in the 86th minute, after Leboeuf had intercepted Kanu, Silvinho met the loose ball with a glorious swerving shot which had the Chelsea goalkeeper grasping at thin air.</p>",

Ipswich are the latest to try to emulate that feat and last night they were taught a harsh lesson in the realities of Premiership survival. </p> <p>There is no doubting Ipswich's ability nor their capacity to pass the ball but, Jim Magilton's late penalty apart, they created very little. Even that goal, the first conceded by Leicester this season, owed a lot to a terrible loss of concentration in the home defence as David Johnson ran clear before being felled by Matt Elliott. \"It was a definite penalty,\" said Elliott. \"I'm just happy I didn't get a yellow card.\" </p> <p>It was an unfortunate end to what had been a professional performance by the home side. Having being given an awkward draw against Red Star Belgrade in the Uefa Cup first round, Leicester wanted this game and Saturday's home fixture against Southampton to act as a morale-boosting springboard into Europe ahead of the first leg a week today. </p> <p>The Leicester chairman John Elsom had returned to England just in time for the game after meeting Uefa in Geneva to discuss the away leg, which he is trying to move from Belgrade. It was, it seemed, a successful trip, with Uefa's hard-line refusal to move the game apparently softening. </p> <p>\"I've got a gut feeling that we won't be playing in Belgrade on September 28,\" he said. Po tentially volatile elections are scheduled for September 24, four days before the game. The results are due to be announced on match day. </p> <p>\"Whatever decision Uefa makes we will abide by that,\" Elsom said, but fans are still warned against travelling. \"The Foreign Office advice is that it is inadvisable to travel to Yugoslavia on anything but unavoidable business. I'm afraid supporting football doesn't fall into that definition.\" </p> <p>A straw poll of the players revealed that most would prefer the game to be moved. \"If they can't guarantee the fans' safety, I don't see how they can guarantee the players',\" said Gerry Taggart. \"We would prefer it to be played in a neutral country,\" added Elliott with typical honesty, \"because of all the advantages it will give us. But, if I were a fan, I'd probably watch it on the box.\" </p> <p>Elsom could ideally have taken a little longer over his return from Switzerland, and there was little in the first half to justify his hassle. The turning point was the half-time arrival of Stan Collymore in place of Muzzy Izzet, who was \"not feeling well\" according to Peter Taylor. </p> <p>Within 10 minutes his flick-on found Darren Eadie, who ran into the box before squaring the ball for Ade Akinbiyi to slide in his first goal for the club. The match was won 15 minutes later when Elliott flicked Steve Guppy's corner over Richard Wright and into the goal from two yards. Leicester remain unbeaten; Ipswich, to emulate them, still have a way to go.</p>",

The Leicester chairman John Elsom had returned to England just in time for the game after meeting Uefa in Geneva to discuss the away leg, which he is trying to move from Belgrade. It was, it seemed, a successful trip, with Uefa's hard-line refusal to move the game apparently softening. \"I've got a gut feeling that we won't be playing in Belgrade on September 28,\" he said. Po tentially volatile elections are scheduled for September 24, four days before the game. The results are due to be announced on match day. \"Whatever decision Uefa makes we will abide by that,\" Elsom said, but fans are still warned against travelling. \"The Foreign Office advice is that it is inadvisable to travel to Yugoslavia on anything but unavoidable business. I'm afraid supporting football doesn't fall into that definition.\" A straw poll of the players revealed that most would prefer the game to be moved. \"If they can't guarantee the fans' safety, I don't see how they can guarantee the players',\" said Gerry Taggart. \"We would prefer it to be played in a neutral country,\" added Elliott with typical honesty, \"because of all the advantages it will give us. But, if I were a fan, I'd probably watch it on the box.\" Elsom could ideally have taken a little longer over his return from Switzerland, and there was little in the first half to justify his hassle. The turning point was the half-time arrival of Stan Collymore in place of Muzzy Izzet, who was \"not feeling well\" according to Peter Taylor. Within 10 minutes his flick-on found Darren Eadie, who ran into the box before squaring the ball for Ade Akinbiyi to slide in his first goal for the club. The match was won 15 minutes later when Elliott flicked Steve Guppy's corner over Richard Wright and into the goal from two yards. Leicester remain unbeaten; Ipswich, to emulate them, still have a way to go.",

The standard is set by the tenor Christopher Steele as the Male Chorus, delivering every word as if it mattered (too many of them in this piece don't, sadly) with admirably even, compassionate tone; his female equivalent, Caroline Childe, is equally lucid, equally caring. Lucretia is sung by Catherine Carby, graciously and touchingly, without quite the grave sumptuousness of tone that a more experienced singer might bring to the role in the final scene. Her servants are carefully portrayed by Anna Sollerman and Lauren Francis; Christopher Dixon makes a striking, impulsive Tarquinius; Rodney Clarke a forthright Junius and Barry Martin a powerfully dark-toned Collatinus. A fine achievement and recommended, if you can get on with the piece itself. </p> <p>Ends tonight.

The standard is set by the tenor Christopher Steele as the Male Chorus, delivering every word as if it mattered (too many of them in this piece don't, sadly) with admirably even, compassionate tone; his female equivalent, Caroline Childe, is equally lucid, equally caring. Lucretia is sung by Catherine Carby, graciously and touchingly, without quite the grave sumptuousness of tone that a more experienced singer might bring to the role in the final scene. Her servants are carefully portrayed by Anna Sollerman and Lauren Francis; Christopher Dixon makes a striking, impulsive Tarquinius; Rodney Clarke a forthright Junius and Barry Martin a powerfully dark-toned Collatinus. A fine achievement and recommended, if you can get on with the piece itself. Ends tonight. Box office: 020-7960 4242. ***** Unmissable **** Recommended *** Enjoyable ** Mediocre * Terrible",

But Russell Beale, for all his moral sensitivity and parodic wit, also conveys the paralysis of the intellectual caught up in a world of realpolitik: there's a defining moment, after Polonius's death, when he has the chance to stab Peter McEnery's taunting Claudius and slowly allows himself to be disarmed. This is a first-rate, deeply intellectual Hamlet whose weapons are primarily verbal and who understands that revenge cannot offer meaningful redress. </p> <p>Caird deserves credit for Russell Beale's interpretation. But it seems typical of the times that he strips the text of all its political resonances. There is no sense of a Denmark on a war-footing, no urgent diplomatic missions, no Fortinbras, so that we lose Hamlet's crucial soliloquy \"How all occasions do inform against me\" and a character who is a practical counterpoise to the meditative hero. In that sense, this is an old-fashioned production that focuses exclusively on Hamlet's tortured sensibility. </p> <p>Where Shakespeare offers variety, the production also offers a glittering sameness. Tim Hatley's set is a candle-lit mausoleum filled with upended trunks and John Cameron's insistent score swaths the play in choral religiosity. Few of the surrounding characters also have a detailed inner life although McEnery's Claudius displays conspicuous bravery, Sara Kestelman's Gertrude decisively bungs her husband's portrait in a case at the end of the closet-scene and Cathryn Bradshaw's Ophelia for once goes mad in her daytime clothes.

Now he is licensed to rock. </p> <p>Doktor Avalanche, of course, is a drum machine. The Sisters of Mercy have, wisely, never employed a human drummer. The uncanny precision of the bass drum and the futuristic violence of the snare remind us that the Sisters forged the template for all the Chemical Brothers-style techno-rock that flared in the mid-90s. </p> <p>The Sisters have been around so long that frontman Andrew Eldritch's trademark Aviator sunglasses are back in fashion - and, for all I know, so is his white polo-neck sweater. But this is not a band given to visual excess: the musicians prefer to stand backlit, an anonymous brotherhood, while Eldritch prowls through the green and purple smoke. </p> <p>While Doktor Avalanche pounds and clatters, the guitars crunch out power chords. Eldritch alternates harsh muttering with Bowie-esque yodelling, or those howls with falsetto attacks so beloved of New Romantics. In between songs he growls soothingly in German. </p> <p>Then one guitarist lets rip the chords that introduce Dominion. \"Some day, some way - Dominion!\" choruses the crowd. The inexorable riffing offers a seductive illusion of power: the audience is made to feel that, in some way, it is causing the music to happen, driving the riffs through force of collective will. </p> <p>The Sisters of Mercy offer glorious rallying hymns for the downtrodden, and for that we salute them. But they didn't play This Corrosion, and for that we are inconsolable. </p> <p>***** Unmissable **** Recommended *** Enjoyable ** Mediocre * Terrible</p>",

      "bodyText": "\"I'm getting bored,\" thinks Doktor Avalanche. \"I've been playing this jaunty shuffle beat for nigh on 20 minutes. When are the rest of the band going to turn up, for heaven's sake?\" He carries on shuffling while the crowd chatters and smokes, until at last he senses a surge in the electrical system, and a crimson flood of guitars bathes him in ecstasy. Now he is licensed to rock. Doktor Avalanche, of course, is a drum machine. The Sisters of Mercy have, wisely, never employed a human drummer. The uncanny precision of the bass drum and the futuristic violence of the snare remind us that the Sisters forged the template for all the Chemical Brothers-style techno-rock that flared in the mid-90s. The Sisters have been around so long that frontman Andrew Eldritch's trademark Aviator sunglasses are back in fashion - and, for all I know, so is his white polo-neck sweater. But this is not a band given to visual excess: the musicians prefer to stand backlit, an anonymous brotherhood, while Eldritch prowls through the green and purple smoke. While Doktor Avalanche pounds and clatters, the guitars crunch out power chords. Eldritch alternates harsh muttering with Bowie-esque yodelling, or those howls with falsetto attacks so beloved of New Romantics. In between songs he growls soothingly in German. Then one guitarist lets rip the chords that introduce Dominion. \"Some day, some way - Dominion!\" choruses the crowd. The inexorable riffing offers a seductive illusion of power: the audience is made to feel that, in some way, it is causing the music to happen, driving the riffs through force of collective will. The Sisters of Mercy offer glorious rallying hymns for the downtrodden, and for that we salute them. But they didn't play This Corrosion, and for that we are inconsolable. ***** Unmissable **** Recommended *** Enjoyable ** Mediocre * Terrible",

Yet.<br> <strong>3</strong> Leboeuf miskicks and Henry has a pop from 40 yards. Worth a go but Cudicini is down quickly to his right to smother the weak shot.<br> <strong>5</strong> Chelsea put their first half-decent move together down the right. Then Grimandi runs full pelt into Wise, knocking him over. Come on, boys, play nicely.<br> <strong>6</strong> Panucci sends a ball down the right-hand channel into the path of the onrushing Di Matteo. Seaman senses the danger and comes out to block the ball with his legs on the edge of the area.<br> <strong>8</strong> Pires and Henry roll smoothly down the left flank and win a corner. Kanu, jumping majestically, beats Cudicini to the resulting set piece, but he fails to connect and the first chance of the match is wasted.<br> <strong>9</strong> Almost immediately, Parlour picks up the ball and bustles to the edge of the area. He pulls back the trigger and shoots and oh dear.<br> <strong>11</strong> Some nice Chelsea interplay on the edge of the Arsenal box. Poyet shoots harmlessly wide.<br> <strong>14</strong> Arsenal win another corner. Meanwhile, Keown and Le Saux point and rant at each other like a couple of blubbing schoolkids. When the kick is finally taken, Grimandi wastes the latest easy free header by glancing the ball wide. Chelsea better watch themselves.<br> <strong>16</strong> This bit was good. Wise, out on the right, curls a lovely cross in towards Hasselbaink, who has peeled away from a static Keown. The Dutch striker places his header to Seaman's left and looks on in disbelief as it's fingertipped away. Great football all round - apart from Keown's contribution, obviously.<br> <strong>21</strong> We're in a period where potentially nice moves keep breaking down because players keep making sloppy loose passes. Great.<br> <strong>24</strong> The first booking - Silvinho is diddled by Panucci near the corner flag and trips him up. Zola takes the resulting free kick and plants the ball on the head of Desailly who, five yards out in the centre of the goalmouth, can only score. Sadly for Chelsea, Leboeuf decides to steal the glory for himself, pushes in first and slaps it wide with his big greedy head.<br> <strong>28</strong> Arsenal are struggling to get the ball at the moment. Luckily, Chelsea aren't doing too much with it.<br> <strong>30 GOAL Chelsea 1 - 0 Arsenal</strong> What do you know? Hasselbaink takes the ball off Luzhny, who has fallen over for no reason twenty yards out. There's still a bit to do, but he slides the ball to his right, takes a couple of steps and smashes the ball past Seaman, who by rights should have had a chance to save it from that range but this time had none.<br> <strong>36</strong> Lauren strokes a 40-yard ball down the right to the feet of Henry, who goes at Desailly. He twists and turns the big defender, making space to drag a shot across the face of goal. Not perfect, but more promising for the Arse.<br> <strong>39</strong> Le Saux upends Lauren, who is beginning to cause Chelsea bother. From the free kick, Arsenal knock it about until they create an opening. Parlour curls in a lovely ball from the right to Henry, who is waiting by the penalty spot. The striker powers in a header but it's straight at Cudicini.<br> <strong>44</strong> Poyet smashes a ball towards Hasselbaink, who is hanging around on the right wing. Soon enough, the ball is despatched into the Arsenal box - luckily Keown is awake this time, and he gets his head in the way to clear the danger.</p> <p><strong>Half-time</strong> Chelsea 1 - 0 Arsenal</p> <p><strong>46</strong> Arsenal start the ball rolling again<br> <strong>47</strong> and almost immediately win a corner. Pires whips the ball in and - for the third time in the match so far - an Arsenal player has an easy header from a corner. Grimandi, six yards out, puts it high and wide.<br> <strong>49</strong> Lauren skins Babayaro on the Chelsea right and plays a ball along the floor to the feet of Kanu, who, with his back to goal, spins round Desailly with one touch. He unluckily crashes his superb shot onto the underside of the crossbar. The ball pops out to the feet of Parlour, who displays hitherto unknown circus skills by shinning the ball away from the goalface.<br> <strong>53</strong> Le Saux is booked for pressing his studs into the shin of his old mate Dixon - it could (and possibly should) have been a red.<br> <strong>56</strong> Parlour nearly has Le Saux's legs off with a pretty little lunge. Coincidence?<br> <strong>57 GOAL Chelsea 2 - 0 Arsenal</strong> Leboeuf humps a free kick towards the Arsenal box. Poyet chests it down into the path of Zola, who doesn't seem to have enough time to get a shot in. But he does, flicking his boot early at the dropping ball before the onrushing Keown can make a challenge. The ball sails past Seaman and settles perfectly in the left-hand corner of the Arsenal net. Now can Kanu do it again?<br> <strong>60</strong> A little skirmish between Grimandi and Panucci is quickly calmed down by the referee and, strangely, Keown.<br> <strong>65</strong> Chelsea well in charge. A couple of corners here, a crisp passing move there. Arsenal are once again finding it difficult to put their foot on the ball.<br> <strong>67</strong> Keown gifts the ball to Hasselbaink, and it's one on one. But the England defender recovers well to push the Chelsea man wide and blocks his shot.<br> <strong>69</strong> Zola rolls in a cross from the right between Seaman and his defenders. It's a brilliantly inviting ball, but Poyet can't quite stretch out his leg to guide it in. <br> <strong>70</strong> Here's an attacking substitution for you: Parlour and Dixon go off for Arsenal, while Bergkamp and - for his debut - Wiltord come on. You can't say it's not a brave move.<br> <strong>71</strong> Now it's Gianluca Vialli's turn to play with the electronic numbers board.

Paul Bettison, leader of Bracknell Forest borough council in Berkshire, yesterday said he had written to Mr Hague to express the misgivings of his councillors. \"While we are 100% behind schools having any responsibility they wish to claim, we would like to know if they will be allowed to stay with the LEA,\" he said. The chairman of governors of the borough's biggest comprehensive would be responsible for a \u00a35m annual budget. \"Are you going to say 'By the way, we don't pay you, give you mileage, or even reimburse your telephone calls'?\" Sandy Bruce-Lockhart, Tory leader of Kent county council, has argued that councils are essential to take big strategic decisions, including \"whether to close a school, where to build a new one, and handling complaints and pupil exclusions\". He said yesterday education authorities would continue to have a role under a Tory government and denied there was friction between councillors and the party leadership.",

Millennium commissioners sparked outrage by agreeing the emergency grant in a political face-saving deal after admitting as few as 4.5m visitors will buy tickets for the Greenwich complex, little more than a third of the 12m originally predicted. The commission said the latest application from new millennium experience company (NMEC) followed an external review of the company's financial position. \"The review has confirmed the commission's concern that there are serious failings in NMEC's financial management,\" the commission said in a statement. Pierre-Yves Gerbeau, the Frenchman hailed as a saviour when he arrived from Disneyland Paris this year, was effectively demoted when he was stripped of his control over its financial running in a fresh management shake-up. The chairman, David Quarmby, who replaced sacked Bob Ayling last May, quit the post after five months to become deputy chairman. He was replaced by City troubleshooter David James, who promised to work for free. The latest \u00a347m injection takes to \u00a3179m the total of public funds pledged this year to keep afloat an enterprise initially dependent on a \u00a3399m lottery grant. But Mr James admitted he could not guarantee the figures would add up even now, as fresh doubts were cast last night on the dome's viability despite already sucking in \u00a3578m - effectively a \u00a3128 per head subsidy for every ticket buyer and equivalent to four times the controversial subsidy at the Royal Opera House. One official at the NMEC, which runs the dome, privately doubted that the \u00a347m would be enough to keep it open until December. Mr James, currently chairman of the Robinson's soft drinks company, disclosed that the dome had been insolvent with \u00a315m in unpaid bills. A Robinson's colleague, John Darlington, is to be paid a fee to organise the sale to a consortium backed by the Japanese investment bank, Nomura, after being made an executive of the company. Mr James held out little prospect of the huge sum handed over ever being repaid after its sale, which is due to be finalised at the end of the year. \"I don't think there is any prospect of any cash recovery once the process of the sale has been completed,\" said Mr James. Yesterday's announcement was humiliating for Mr Gerbeau who in May said he had \"fixed the dome\" and would \"not ask the commission for any more handouts\", claiming they were loans, though Mr James made clear they could never be repaid. \"Whatever P-Y has said, he said with the best knowledge that he had at the time,\" said Mr James. The dome was intended by Tony Blair to represent all that was good about \"Cool Britannia\" and form a springboard to a second election victory after over-riding cabinet doubts to continue a project inherited from the last Tory administration. But what was supposed to be the greatest show on earth has proved an embarrassing financial black hole. More than 60 Labour MPs signed a Commons motion before Parliament broke up for the summer recess demanding that no more money be spent on the Greenwich white elephant. Last night backbencher Bob Marshall-Andrews called the latest spending spree a \"national scandal\" and added: \"It will never recoup any of this money. It is completely dead money and it is an outrage. Worse than that there is a total lack of accountability for this public money. Parliament is not even sitting.\" The Tories demanded the head of Lord Falconer, the Cabinet Office minister and close friend of the prime minister who inherited the dome from Peter Mandelson. Peter Ainsworth, the shadow culture secretary, said: \"If this is not a resignation matter, then I don't know what is. Lord Falconer is the sole shareholder in NMEC, which has been accused of serious financial mismanagement.\" Lord Falconer said: \"Of course, it is very, very regrettable but in terms of the public interest it is the right course to take.\" A two-hour meeting of the commission, chaired by Chris Smith, and attended by Mo Mowlam and Michael Heseltine, had decided earlier to approve the further \u00a347m despite assurances in May, when another \u00a329m had been agreed, that it was the last rescue package. A commission statement said: \"The commission is extremely sorry that there should be yet another call on lottery funds. It welcomes the full review being undertaken by the national audit office and believes that there will be important lessons to be learnt about the management of major national projects.\" Mr James, 62, said he was approached four weeks ago and PricewaterhouseCoopers had gone over the books. Shutting it before the Nomura consortium was ready to take over the dome as a theme park, he claimed, would cost up to \u00a340m more in redundancies, termination of contracts and disconnection fees. Asked why he had agreed to become the dome's executive chairman and work for free, four days a week until the end of the year, Mr James said: \"Like Everest, it is there, you have to climb it.

Prescription charges are also to be cut, while charges for dental and eye check-ups would be scrapped entirely, subsidised by a 10p increase on cigarettes.</p> <p>Contradicting William Hague's reform plans for state pensions, the Liberal Democrats also pledge to increase the basic state pension and make extra payments to the over-75s and over-80s.

      "bodyText": "The Liberal Democrats today began setting out their stall for next year's general election, resolving to increase taxation and benefits in their pre-manifesto document Freedom in a Liberal Society. The party leader, Charles Kennedy, confirmed that fiscal policy would be the important battleground for the election. \"We remain of the view that there is a big argument to be had at the next election, and we are quite clear what side of the street we will be on when this argument takes place, about the decent funding of quality public services,\" he told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. \"You can't get something for nothing.\" Among the proposals were plans to introduce a new top rate tax of 50p on those earning more than \u00a3100,000 a year, while reducing taxation for those worse off by abolishing the 10p starting rate on income tax. The party plans to invest in the NHS, recruiting and training an extra 5,000 doctors and 20,000 nurses over three years. Prescription charges are also to be cut, while charges for dental and eye check-ups would be scrapped entirely, subsidised by a 10p increase on cigarettes. Contradicting William Hague's reform plans for state pensions, the Liberal Democrats also pledge to increase the basic state pension and make extra payments to the over-75s and over-80s. Child benefits are also to be increased for the youngest child under five. The pre-manifesto also promised more cash for the police, education and public transport. The Lib Dems' political opponents rounded on the proposals. The Treasury chief secretary, Andrew Smith, described the plans as \"a menu without the prices\". He said: \"Their sums simply don't add up.

Full proportional representation, abolition of the House of Lords, an extension of the electoral franchise to 16-year-olds and European constitution were outlined, as well as measures to combat discrimination and ensure asylum-seekers are treated fairly. On defence, as Labour party documents this week revealed plans to drop the \"ethical\" tag from current foreign policy, the Liberal Democrats promise to end subsidies for arms sold to foreign regimes and work for the elimination of all nuclear weapons.",

The couple sold their north London home and moved to Buckinghamshire last year in an attempt to build their lives together away from the temptations of the capital. When baby Anais was born in January, Noel described the event as the \"best thing ever\" to have happened to him. His spokeswoman said last night: \"The couple have lived through, or been together during, the whole meteoric rise of the band and the turbulent years that followed, always under the constant glare of the media. Many things have changed in that time, including themselves it would seem.\" She added: \"They are still friends and are still devoted to Anais. At the moment, it's a separation.\" The split comes at a difficult time for Gallagher, who recently walked out on his band's US tour. Last month his younger brother Liam and his actress wife Patsy Kensit announced they were to divorce. Both couples wed in 1997 but it was always the elder Gallagher who was deemed to have the more stable marriage. In an interview in the Radio Times in April, Gallagher said of his wife: \"If she left me I'd be destroyed. She's my best friend - I still consider her my girlfriend, not my wife - and I'd never risk what we have for a one-night stand.\"",

Last week I was saying how draw/favourite represented better value than favourite/favourite and its good to see that someone at least appears to be listening to my advice. My only reservation would be that the Dutch injury crisis touched upon by Mr MacInnes, allied with the fact that most of their players play in Italy and Spain and thus are short of match practice, made the second part of the equation, the Dutch full-time win, considerably less likely (although, of course, making the half-time draw more likely). If I was going to have a bet on this game it probably would have been on Ireland on the Asian Handicap where they were getting a goal and a quarter as it was hard to see the makeshift Dutch team, albeit still a team packed with stars, dominating the game in the way Louis Van Gaal's first choice eleven might have. But I don't think Paul has done a lot wrong here and if he keeps thinking along these value lines he should make a profit on the season. </p> <p><strong>Craig Thomas</strong><br> France v England - Thierry Henry first scorer, correct score 3-1 (to France) at 28-1: \u00a37.50 </p> <p>I know one shouldn't be rude to, or about, guests but really I'm left with little choice. The scorecast, as the first goalscorer and correct score double is known, is what we in the trade like to call a 'fun bet', a euphemism for 'mug bet' that perfectly encapsulates the way the bookmaker wants you, the punter, to view gambling. We all bet for fun I hope - and who can deny the enjoyment to be had in punting on a long shot to add a little extra spice to your football viewing - but betting for fun and betting for profit are two different, and often mutually exclusive, things.

Mr Thomas's use of the word value (combined with the word good just to compound the error) in the context of a scorecast fills me with despair. Is Henry to score first and France to win 3-1 really a 28/1 shot? I don't think so; 100/1 would be far nearer the mark. To reach this price of 28/1 the bookies have multiplied the price of Henry to score first (first goalscorer being a market with a massive profit margin) by the price of 3-1 to France (correct score being a market with a massive profit margin) and then added on a load more percentage because the two outcomes are slightly connected (if Henry scores first a 3-1 victory to France is more likely than if, say, Adams scores first). There are thousands of possible different outcomes to this market and I wouldn't even rate Henry and 3-1 in the top ten. But enough opprobrium. If you want a fun bet I heartily recommend scorecasts; if you want a value bet don't touch it with a bargepole.

He could have gone for Norway to beat Armenia at 1/8, he could have backed the Ukraine, Holland, Italy, Slovenia etc etc all of whom failed to oblige but he chose Yugoslavia, Israel, Brazil and Sweden. Luck or judgement? Who am I to say?</p> <p>As Mr I isn't slow to tell us all his teams were \"certainties\", but if the certainties always won there won't be any bookies left.

No one save the bookies that is, because, as Mr Ingle kindly reminds us, they can fail to oblige, as Portugal did against Azerbaijan last year, as Norway did on Saturday.</p> <p>Mr Ingle has finally won some money however, for which we must applaud him.

Paul Dainton inadvertently allowed budgie China to escape when he left the door to his aviary open. But he revealed his erstwhile pet may find it hard to disguise his identity while on the run, as it speaks in a distinct Oriental patois. The latest lead came from a fisherman at nearby Kirkthorpe, who spoke to a budgie that reportedly replied: \"'Ello, wa ya want?\" Mr Dainton, who acquired the bird from a Chinese restaurant in Manchester when it shut down, said: \"He talks Chinese and a bit of pidgin English. Things like 'rice or chips'.\" Paul is offering the reward of a Chinese meal for two for the budgie's return. Yorkshire Evening Post Royal Mail try boxing clever Abusive Cleethorpes parents have brought chaos to a Royal Mail post box outside Signhills school. The 3.30pm collection from the box was cancelled after a postie was verbally abused as she picked up the mail. Now, according to councillor Keith Brookes, frequently residents \"cannot get their letter in and there is mail about to fall out.\" Further, he claimed the postie's delivery van used to park right next to the box, blocking the school car park entrance. Parents had, for a long time, politely asked the driver to park the van just 10 yards away, before apparently cracking. As a temporary concession, the Royal Mail has introduced a 4pm collection. But an insider claimed that a bigger box was not needed and blockages caused by large objects were behind the overflows. Mr Brookes urged people not to use the post box unless they could see the letter actually drop right inside it. Grimsby Telegraph Signifying nothing Five new signs to encourage visitors to come to Oswestry have sparked bitter criticism. The signs - paid for with European funding - have been condemned as being in the wrong place. Town mayor, councillor Heather Bickerton, said: \"The signs are placed on the approach roads to the town, but motorists can only see them when they have already decided to come to Oswestry. \"They should be placed on the bypass so motorists can clearly see what attractions the town has then, they can decided whether to come here or not.'' Council transport officer Richard Jones said: \"Unfortunately the Highways Agency would not allow us to place the signs on the bypass so we had to place them as close as possible.\" However, he added, the council was intending to contact the local MP to lobby for \"other signs to be placed on the bypass directing motorists to the larger signs.\" Border Counties Advertiser Saddam slight causes council gulf A council press officer has survived a no-confidence motion brought by fellow councillors after he compared them to Saddam Hussein. Bramhope parish council chairman John Mordy called a debate on the future of fellow councillor Clive Fox after the latter likened the council's attempts to extend the parish boundary into neighbouring Arthington to the Iraqi leader's invasion of Kuwait. Mr Mordy said the council must \"consider whether it is still appropriate that councillor Fox should continue.\" The press officer's analogy of Bramhope council with a brutal Middle East dictator had, he said, made them \"very unhappy.\" Other members of the parish council said they were happy to let Mr Fox continue in the role. An unrepentant Mr Fox asked for an apology from the council for questioning his right to attend meetings. Wharfedale Observer",

Well, it's been one-way stuff since then, and Northants have been at the wheel. This piece is by way of apology. Because I never lost faith really.</p> <p>Since that cock-up at Cardiff in mid-July, Northamptonshire have won five Championship games in a row - and now need just six points from their final two matches to be the first side to gain promotion in the history of the competition. They have also won four out of five National League matches to move to third in Division One. The government's Do Not Resuscitate orders clearly didn't reach Wantage Road.</p> <p>The recovery has taken place for a number of reasons. They started when one of the worst things to happen to Northamptonshire turned out to be a whopping great rain-cloud with a golden lining. Michael Davies, the left-arm spinner who toured with England A last winter, got the yips against Warwickshire and was dropped for offspinner Jason Brown. The change worked pretty well at first as Brown took 15 wickets at 24.53 in his first three games.</p> <p>But it really paid off when 35-year-old left-arm seamer Paul Taylor returned to the side after injury. The rough he created outside the right-hander's off stump was just what Brown needed to move up a gear. In the next five games, all of which Northants won, Brown picked up 38 wickets at 18.03, including four five-fors and two ten-wicket hauls. </p> <p>Taylor's inclusion also put an end to a search for a consistent opening bowler to go with the excellent, under-rated Darren Cousins, who had taken 57 wickets at 19.33 before today's game against Essex, despite having to plug away on the unresponsive wickets at Northampton. Taylor, a regular 50-wickets-a-season man, was more accurate than Devon Malcolm (now on the lookout for another county) and more penetrative than Richard Logan and Michael Strong. At Eastbourne, where Sussex prepared a greentop in an attempt to neutralise Brown and Graeme Swann, Taylor cashed in with 10 for 69.</p> <p>The batting too has got better. Matthew Hayden started turning quickfire 40s into quickfire 100s and responded to the Glamorgan game by scoring 341 in his next three innings. </p> <p>Then there's Russell Warren. Four years ago, on the back of a double-hundred against Glamorgan, he was being talked about as the next England wicketkeeper. Then he lost his form - and his place in the Northants side. Now he returned, at the expense of Mal Loye, who kept hitting sixes and then getting himself out, and began with scores of 60 and 151. </p> <p>With a more dependable middle order allowing Tony Penberthy to grind out the scores, Northants regularly batted their opponents out of the game. Against Worcestershire they made 519 and won by an innings and 72; against Sussex 460 and an innings and 17; against Gloucestershire 469 and an innings and 74. Relentless, ruthless and victorious - everything, in fact, that Northants have struggled to be for four years.</p> <p>They've emerged well from the few tight spots they've encountered as well. In the match at Eastbourne, Northants trailed by 43 on first innings in a low-scoring affair. But Jeff Cook, who had scraped together just 69 runs in his previous six Championship knocks, came to the rescue with 116. Set 228, Sussex made 65. And in a recent National League game, Kent began the final two overs needing just 10 with Rahul Dravid at the crease.

      "body": "<p>The most difficult part about composing a conciliatory letter to Dilys was having to pretend that I was somebody else. Please don't take this too literally: I didn't write under a false name (that would have been a bit transparent, don't you think?). But I found that it was impossible to set out my position to my former partner in anything approaching my true voice. </p> <p>How does that voice sound? Oh, you know: scornful, sardonic, sour - the one you know and love. However, having promised Gloria while walking on the beach that I would try to build a bridge of understanding with her mother as soon as we returned from Little England-on-Sea, I felt honour-bound to use any device that worked, however inhibiting, however absurd. So I made believe that Dilys was an elderly dowager living in the late 1940s and that I was her solicitous bank manager. The letter started off: \"Dear Dilys...\" </p> <p>Of course, such a familiar beginning was not at all in character, but I could hardly have addressed her as \"Miss Day\". One of the curiosities of relationships between hostile former partners is that they never cease to be on first-name terms. </p> <p>Anyway, my letter continued: \"Now that we are approaching the fifth anniversary of our relationship ending, I am wondering if this would be an appropriate juncture at which to take stock of the situation that has subsequently arisen...\" </p> <p>You can't beat a bit of old- fashioned formality, can you? All the boiling inner furies neatly concealed beneath a cloak of civility. I even wrote it with a fountain pen. My only regret is that I didn't have a quill. </p> <p>\"If I may count on your indulgence, perhaps I could enumerate one or two matters regarding our shared care of the children which are giving me particular concern...\" </p> <p>Admittedly, all this plodding formality did create the risk that Dilys would think I was taking the piss. Only a small risk, though. An inflated opinion of her own importance has given Dilys a big blind spot where satire is concerned. Besides, by this stage I was having too much fun to stop. </p> <p>\"My considered diagnosis is that most of the causes of tension in the present arrangement arise from your preoccupation with promoting a certain sort of relationship between Gloria, Jed and Billy and your present spouse Chris...\" </p> <p>Actually, this was the sentence that gave me the most problems. \"Spouse\" is a stupid word, but Chris, presumably because he's besotted with all things \"alternative\", has not become Dilys's husband, and the word \"partner\" always makes me think of doubles teams in tennis. </p> <p>But my greatest difficulty was resisting the urge to shatter the affected mood of deference I'd so lovingly created by describing Chris as \"that pillock you ran off with\". For five long minutes I fought the awful urge by kneeling on the floor and biting on the corner of the kitchen table. Only then did I feel able to resume. </p> <p> I won't treat you to further excerpts - too much of a good thing, and all that. Let me simply record that I briefly listed what bothers me the most about the regime chez Pillock and suggested to Dilys that she reply, enumerating any anxieties of her own, with a view to sorting out some of our differences. </p> <p>Let me also disclose the underlying spirit of my lovingly constructed overture. The fundamental point is this: my dislike of Dilys is utterly exhausting and, for all my gritted-teeth efforts at keeping it from them, nothing but destructive for the children. Alas, hostilities can be consoling, even when only conducted in the crazier corners of your own head. The holiday period, though, has made me braver. Billy has been all sweetness, some of the thunderclouds have lifted from Jed's brow, and Gloria has started feeling like my kindred-spirit daughter once again. More secure in myself, I've been able to think of Dilys and Chris less as my looming nemeses and more as a pair of terminal self-obsessives who need saving from themselves. </p> <p>I finished off my letter at 3.30 in the morning.

Ojay and Troy Keen are out training with their father Derek, whose dream is that at least one of them will become a Premiership footballer. \"Come on! Don't slow down, Troy!\" shouts Derek. A little voice comes back: \"I can't, I can't.\" Derek shouts again: \"Quicker, Troy! You're going too slow!\" </p> <p>Derek is a devoted soccer dad. He takes his sons for early morning runs, he spends his weekends and evenings ferrying them to training and matches; he watches their performances as closely as Alex Ferguson watches Beckham and Giggs. He's a season ticket holder at Chelsea but he'd much rather watch his sons playing in the local boys' Sunday league. </p> <p>Especially Ojay. Because Ojay, the elder of the two boys, is going to make it. Derek feels it in his bones. Ojay, he says, is like a mini Roy Keane, but faster and more skilful. He's 10 years old and he's the best of his age his dad has seen. \"I love watching him play. You're watching your own flesh and blood out there. I feel proud. Very, very proud.\" </p> <p>Derek and his sons are featured in a Modern Times television documentary called Go On My Son!, which follows a group of fathers involved in boys' football in south London. It's entertaining, thought-provoking television, raising interesting issues about father-son bonding, about talented children, ambitious parents and the potential dangers when the two are combined. </p> <p>The world of sport is full of ambitious, pushy parents, but football - our national sport and obsession, the stars of which are constantly paraded before us, with their ever increasing wealth and status - is in a league of its own. </p> <p>Parents sign up their four-year-olds for football training; fathers are willing to make a pact with the devil to secure a place for their son in the Arsenal under-12s. But with all the risks, the disappointments and the pressure involved, it hardly seems a desirable career choice for your child. Or does it? </p> <p>\"I want it all day long for him,\" Derek says unambiguously. \"If you are going to do a job you enjoy and get paid for it, why not? I wouldn't make him do it for the love of the money. I want him to do it for the love of the game.\" </p> <p>On the south London youth football circuit, Derek must be among the most vocal. He stands on the sidelines, his hands thrust deep into his pockets, hurling gobbets of advice, criticism and - occasionally - praise at his son. \"Ojay, move up. Move up!\" He groans and turns away in despair. \" I'm pissed off with this. Ojay, move up !!\" When Ojay comes off the field, Derek tells him it's the worst he's seen him play. Ojay runs off, distraught. Meanwhile, Troy, who is playing elsewhere, watched by his mother, Dawn, is upset because he thinks his dad is more interested in Ojay than him. </p> <p>Off the pitch, Derek, a 40-year-old builder, is much less fearsome. The kitchen of the family's terraced house is filled with football trophies, there is football on the television and the small back garden is dominated by a set of goalposts. Ojay and Troy, who is nine, were still in the baby walker when they started messing around with a football; they went to their first Chelsea match when they were two. Derek's father, who died when he was 14, did not share his interest in football. Derek never got the support he now gives to his sons and he feels he missed out. </p> <p>Derek insists that his sons don't miss out on anything; they do exactly the same things as other children. Their schoolwork is good; they have friends and other interests; but Derek is very serious about their football. If he thinks they've been slacking during training, when everyone else is going home at the end he makes them do it again. At school, he has instructed Ojay not to play football at playtime because of the risk of injuring his joints on the concrete playground. \"I don't hear anyone moaning about Tiger Woods's dad pushing him,\" he says. </p> <p>He is determined that Ojay will not lose his focus as he gets older. One girl has already been ringing him up, trying to get him interested in her. \"I said to him straight, these girls are not coming between you and your football. I've seen it happen, at 14 or 15, they want girlfriends, they're going out all the time, they're having their first four or five pints, and they're not turning up for their matches. I'm not going to let that happen.\" Ojay, a beautiful, quiet boy with an inscrutable face, shrugs when you ask him about the pressure. \"It's OK with me. I like playing football.\" </p> <p>But what if Ojay decides he doesn't want to pursue his football? \"The day my son turns to me and says he doesn't want to do it I'll be upset, but it's something I'm going to accept straightaway. I would never want that to happen, but if it happens, it happens. If Ojay wanted to be a solicitor, or a doctor, that's fine by me. Whatever makes him happy.\" He almost sounds convincing, then he adds: \"But I couldn't help him out as much.\" In other words , football is something they can share together as father and son - law and medicine they cannot. </p> <p>A mutual interest between parent and child is an important part of bonding - as reflected in tonight's film - according to educational psychologist Professor David Fontana, but there are enormous dangers if the child has not got the talent or motivation. \"Certainly it's important if the child is very good at something, to support them physically by taking them to matches and emotionally by sharing in their success. </p> <p>But it's very important for parents to realise that what's interesting for a child, whether it's music or sport, that interest may not last into adult life. If there's failure later on, there's not only the father's feeling of being let down, but the son's feeling of letting the father down. </p> <p>Childhood, says Fontana, is a part of life that is valid in and of itself. It should not simply be a preparation for adult life. \"If parents invest too much of themselves, their time, money and ambitions, and their children cannot live up to that, it's very destructive for the relationship between the parent and child and also for the child's self-esteem.\" </p> <p>Jack Tarr, chairman of the English Schools Football Association, also urges fathers to be cautious. \"It's nice to be able to go into the pub and say - my son plays for Chelsea under 12s. But the chances of going all the way - well, it really is clutching at straws. There are so few boys who can possibly make it into the premier league.\" </p> <p>\"Football is a wonderful game,\" says Tarr. \"But it's a game that can lead to great disappointment.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Ask any pregnant woman about her hopes and fears and she'll tell you the same thing: all she wants is a healthy baby. These days, science can increase her chances of that - but, as TV presenter Ulrika Jonsson has discovered, it can also diagnose a serious illness in a baby whose birth is several months away. </p> <p>How does it feel to be pregnant with a baby who may not survive infancy? Ulrika is said to be devastated by the news, which came after an ultrasound scan, that her baby has a rare heart condition known as double-inlet left-ventricle defect. The chances of success are thought to be good, but no two cases are the same and the baby will have to endure at least three critical operations. </p> <p>Mother-of-three Louise Hall knows what Ulrika and her partner, Markus Kempen, are going through. Five years ago she and her husband, Duncan, were told that their unborn son had a potentially fatal heart condition called hyperplastic left-heart syndrome. </p> <p>For Louise, the remaining weeks of the pregnancy were the hardest part of a desperately difficult year. \"Until Ben was born I seemed to be carrying the weight of it all: I felt it was just my problem. I never said, 'Why me?', but there were times I'd see a pregnant woman drinking or smoking, and I would think, 'Hold on a moment - I haven't been doing that, but look what's happened to my baby.' Some days were very hard to get through.\" </p> <p>When the diagnosis was confirmed, at around 20 weeks, Louise was offered three choices. \"I was told I could opt to continue, and the baby could have surgery after the birth. Or I could carry on, but not opt for the surgery, in which case the child would certainly die. Or I could opt for a termination. </p> <p>\"We considered termination briefly, but to be honest we couldn't face it - the baby was moving around by then.\" The Halls decided they would carry on and have their baby operated on - but there was no way they could pretend the pregnancy was normal any more. \"I was aware that, if my baby died, his life inside me would be the only life he'd ever have,\" says Louise. \"So I knew I had to make the most of it, and I had to make sure that although he wasn't yet born, he was a real person to us. </p> <p>\"We found out he was a boy, so we gave him a name, Ben, and I talked to people about him by name. What I didn't want was for him to be born and die without anyone but me knowing him. </p> <p>\"I got very good at telling people Ben's story, but inside it was always hard, because pregnancy is all about the beginning of a new life, and it goes against your deepest grain to tell someone that your baby might be going to die.\" There was also the issue of being judged by people who felt that, if they had been in the Halls' shoes, they'd have taken a different course of action. </p> <p>Like Louise, Angelina Fellowes was around 20 weeks pregnant when a routine scan showed that her unborn son's heart hadn't formed properly. \"They couldn't tell exactly what was wrong, so I was referred to Guy's Hospital,\" she says. \"There, I was told that my baby had not only double-inlet left-ventricle defect, but several other heart problems as well. As a midwife I knew I had the option to terminate, but I didn't want to do that. When she gave me the news, the doctor went straight on to talk about what could be done, and that was very important to me.

      "bodyText": "Ask any pregnant woman about her hopes and fears and she'll tell you the same thing: all she wants is a healthy baby. These days, science can increase her chances of that - but, as TV presenter Ulrika Jonsson has discovered, it can also diagnose a serious illness in a baby whose birth is several months away. How does it feel to be pregnant with a baby who may not survive infancy? Ulrika is said to be devastated by the news, which came after an ultrasound scan, that her baby has a rare heart condition known as double-inlet left-ventricle defect. The chances of success are thought to be good, but no two cases are the same and the baby will have to endure at least three critical operations. Mother-of-three Louise Hall knows what Ulrika and her partner, Markus Kempen, are going through. Five years ago she and her husband, Duncan, were told that their unborn son had a potentially fatal heart condition called hyperplastic left-heart syndrome. For Louise, the remaining weeks of the pregnancy were the hardest part of a desperately difficult year. \"Until Ben was born I seemed to be carrying the weight of it all: I felt it was just my problem. I never said, 'Why me?', but there were times I'd see a pregnant woman drinking or smoking, and I would think, 'Hold on a moment - I haven't been doing that, but look what's happened to my baby.' Some days were very hard to get through.\" When the diagnosis was confirmed, at around 20 weeks, Louise was offered three choices. \"I was told I could opt to continue, and the baby could have surgery after the birth. Or I could carry on, but not opt for the surgery, in which case the child would certainly die. Or I could opt for a termination. \"We considered termination briefly, but to be honest we couldn't face it - the baby was moving around by then.\" The Halls decided they would carry on and have their baby operated on - but there was no way they could pretend the pregnancy was normal any more. \"I was aware that, if my baby died, his life inside me would be the only life he'd ever have,\" says Louise. \"So I knew I had to make the most of it, and I had to make sure that although he wasn't yet born, he was a real person to us. \"We found out he was a boy, so we gave him a name, Ben, and I talked to people about him by name. What I didn't want was for him to be born and die without anyone but me knowing him. \"I got very good at telling people Ben's story, but inside it was always hard, because pregnancy is all about the beginning of a new life, and it goes against your deepest grain to tell someone that your baby might be going to die.\" There was also the issue of being judged by people who felt that, if they had been in the Halls' shoes, they'd have taken a different course of action. Like Louise, Angelina Fellowes was around 20 weeks pregnant when a routine scan showed that her unborn son's heart hadn't formed properly. \"They couldn't tell exactly what was wrong, so I was referred to Guy's Hospital,\" she says. \"There, I was told that my baby had not only double-inlet left-ventricle defect, but several other heart problems as well. As a midwife I knew I had the option to terminate, but I didn't want to do that. When she gave me the news, the doctor went straight on to talk about what could be done, and that was very important to me. It seemed really positive.\" But the rest of the pregnancy was tough. \"I've got two older sons so I've got lots of baby clothes in the attic, but I didn't get them down or buy any new ones. Most of the time I just tried to keep busy so I didn't have to think about it. But some days I was distraught - it was so terrible to just have to wait, not knowing until the birth how bad things would be.\" For Angelina - as for Louise and Ulrika Jonsson - the workings of the foetal circulatory system meant that the baby was safe inside the uterus.

The police warning came as it was revealed that a crowd of 50 youths had been able to rampage, unheeded, through the streets of west London, killing one man. Another carnivalgoer was also murdered during the two-day event. Yesterday assistant commissioner Ian Johnston said that crowd density had made policing of the event extremely difficult and slow. Earlier a Metropolitan police spokesman conceded that the gang had been able to attack Abdul Bhatti, 28, beating and kicking him unconscious, unmonitored by police. Mr Bhatti died the following day in hospital. Mr Johnston suggested that less crowded bottlenecks on the carnival route, earlier closing down of sound systems, improved stewarding and a thinning out of crowd density would help the policing effort. Answering the criticism of the hands-off approach adopted for this year's event, Mr Johnston said: \"Officers were given advice and guidance on when and how to intervene at carnival to ensure that public safety and officers' safety considerations were paramount. It is absolute nonsense to suggest that we had a no arrest policy when there was an 84% increase in arrests.\" Earlier Mr Bhatti's mother and sister held a press conference at Scotland Yard appealing for carnivalgoers to help police track down the gang. Detective Chief Inspector Steve Condon, conducting the murder inquiry, said the murder was being treated as a racial attack after a witness told police that the gang had been throwing bricks and bottles at Asian stallholders and one of them had been heard to say \"let's get them\", on seeing Mr Bhatti and his friends. DCI Condon said the gang of predominantly young black men had tried to snatch a gold chain from the neck of one of Mr Bhatti's friends, but had turned their attack on the salesman from Hounslow, west London, after he tried to stop the robbery. Some of the gang were later arrested for unrelated offences, and captured on police cameras, but were not charged. The DJ Norman Jay, a popular figure at carnival for 20 years, was yesterday reported to have added his voice to the calls for carnival to be reorganised.\"Notting Hill can no longer go on accommodating ever increasing numbers,\" he said. The Kensington and Chelsea MP, Michael Portillo, also said organisation of the carnival should be overhauled.",

But while the single initial contact, provided by a BT or Cable and Wireless operator, gives the impression of a co-ordinated system for despatching emergency services, nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, behind the scenes each emergency service runs its own control room, sometimes more than one. In a world supposed to be striving for joined-up government, 999 callers needing more than one emergency service are frequently required to make their request for assistance and give their details three separate times. </p> <p>To the man on the street, the existence of three separate control rooms for local emergency services is nonsensical. Yet across England and Wales, 43 police forces, 38 ambulance trusts and 50 fire brigades boast as many as 192 separate control rooms. When the government came to power, it committed itself to ending this duplication of services. In 1998, the then health secretary Frank Dobson told ambulance services: \"The taxpayer can't be expected to pay out three times over and we must look for the best deal for all these services. This means looking at joint control and communication systems. That's got to make sense.\" </p> <p>The proposal for joint control operations has already been shown to work in other countries. Dobson said the policy had backing across government. </p> <p>Since his declaration, three pilot schemes - in Cleveland, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire - have kicked off with funding from the government's \"invest-to-save\" budget. But there are growing doubts that the rest of the country will follow suit. </p> <p>The prime benefit of shared control rooms should be a more effective response to emergencies. \"That could simply mean a faster response, and in many emergencies seconds can save lives,\" says Phil Bland, project manager for the shared control room project in Cleveland. \"Or it could mean that a multi-service response is better resourced, more co-ordinated and has the right equipment.\" </p> <p>So called \"first responders\" are already being established in emergency services, carrying equipment such as defibrillators for heart attack victims. Often it may be that a fire engine or police car with trained personnel and the right equipment is closer to an incident than the nearest ambulance. But at the moment, the ambulance control room would have to make a couple of phone calls to find out. The new system in Cleveland would automatically provide that information across all three emergency services. \"We could see where the nearest appropriately trained resource was from the mapping system,\" says David Craig, chief executive of Tees, East and North Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS trust. \"It is about reducing delay in critical situations when someone is suffering.\" </p> <p>Cleveland is the most advanced project, with ambulance control staff already moved in to the control room at the police headquarters - albeit still working on different computer systems. Both Gloucestershire's and Wiltshire's projects involve building new premises to house the shared control rooms. All projects claim major benefits. Wiltshire is adamant that a shared control room will enable mobilisation of the three services in parallel, rather than in series, improving overall response times to incidents. And according to Gloucestershire's deputy chief fire officer, John Bonney, on top of the service benefits there will be significant cost savings through buying equipment and services in bulk. </p> <p>Cleveland estimates that co-location of control rooms will save some \u00a3300,000 a year from 2003 through having a single software licence, centralised system maintenance and common fall-back arrangements. But it is perhaps in integration of control room staff where most cost savings lie. According to Bland, Cleveland could save an additional \u00a3125,000 a year from more flexible use of staff. All services have quiet patches, particularly in the middle of the night, and it is hard to justify three separate control rooms in such circumstances. </p> <p>Despite such prospects, all three projects have currently stopped short of real integration, opting instead for co-location of control rooms (shared controls) rather than actually merging operations (joint controls). In part, this is a recognition of the different protocols governing the different control room staff. Urgency of response is graded by the police and by ambulance services that have introduced priority-based despatching, while the fire service normally provides an immediate response to all calls. Each service asks different questions and takes different amounts of details before despatching an emergency vehicle. For fire services it takes an estimated 30-60 seconds from the receipt of the call to the transmission of a mobilisation message; for police and ambulance, it takes two to three minutes. </p> <p>But there is another more basic problem. Control room staff are naturally concerned about job cuts. And there are also huge variations in their pay, with fire service control staff earning some \u00a37,000 a year more than those in the ambulance service. Perhaps predictably, the Fire Brigades Union is having none of these \"merger\" proposals. In Cleveland, where the joint project admits to a long-term goal of moving towards generic call-takers and despatchers, once co-location has been evaluated, firefighters are already threatening to ballot for strike action. </p> <p>Recently, the union seems to have had some backing from a strange source. A report commissioned by the Home Office has recommended the creation of bigger, regional control rooms within the fire service and rejected joint or shared controls across all emergency services. The report, intended as guidance for fire authorities conducting \"best value\" reviews of control rooms this year, claims that \"joint controls [with common call takers] are unlikely to be feasible in the medium term at least\" while shared controls would \"impede the organisational development of the fire service and result in only minor savings\". </p> <p>Although the report says the invest-to-save pilots should continue to be supported and encouraged, it is hardly promoting joined-up government. At face value, it seems to shatter the cross-departmental support for the pilot schemes promised by Dobson two years ago. To many, it is just the fire side of the Home Office protecting its empire. But the public may pay a high price for such protectionism if it means the emergency services miss an opportunity to improve response times and save taxpayers' money.</p>",

      "body": "<p>For many medium-sized charities, the loss of a high-profile patron and increased competition for funds would prove a major strain. Add to that a need to stretch resources to meet the needs of new user groups and the diagnosis becomes even worse. Which is why youth homelessness charity Centrepoint has just completed a major restructuring programme that will result in it having a stronger training and employment remit, a new-look management team and a greater emphasis on partnership work. </p> <p>When Centrepoint began life in 1969 as a temporary night shelter in a church basement in London's Soho, phrases like \"social exclusion\" and the \"hidden homeless\" were unheard of. Thirty years on, the charity runs a network of emergency shelters, hostels and flats in London and provides more than 2,000 young people with housing and employment advice each year. On a national level, it works with local homelessness groups and other agencies to support young people at risk. It is also a well-known brand, being one of only six charities that Diana, Princess of Wales, continued to support after her resignation in 1996 from more than 100 charities. </p> <p>At least half the young people using Centrepoint facilities are now young girls or women, and the charity says increasing numbers of black and ethnic young people are using its services. Addressing these changes is high on Centrepoint's agenda. In addition, the charity has until now focused on housing and preventative work. A key aim of its new, five-year plan is to strengthen its follow-through work with young people, in areas like life skills, access to training and job search. </p> <p>Chief executive Victor Adebowale believes this will result in the charity providing a more holistic service to young people. \"The provision of housing is not going to work unless we have a package of employment and training measures in place,\" he says. \"How do you provide services to a young person who's been kicked out of home when one in seven has difficulty reading and writing, and 25% have experience of the care system - and so could be emotionally damaged?\" </p> <p>Adebowale suggests this strategy fits into the government's own approach to education and employment for young people. \"The challenge is to deepen, not abandon, our involvement in housing. We want to build on to that effective employment and training.\" </p> <p>Meeting its current responsibilities cost Centrepoint about \u00a39m last year. In 1999, just over a third of its income came from donations, just under a third from statutory grants and some 20% from rents and charges (the charity is a registered social landlord). General reserves are virtually non-existent following a period of rapid expansion. </p> <p>Faced with a fundraising target of \u00a33m this year, Centrepoint has taken the view that partnerships are the only way to deliver its new aims. </p> <p>\"We don't pretend that we can complete this work on our own,\" admits Adebowale.\" </p> <p>Centrepoint already works with partners like the Peabody Trust to give young people training and career advice. As well as expanding this work, the charity also wants to talk to local authorities in light of the housing green paper's proposals on providing housing services for the young. These include extending local authority \"priority\" areas to cover people who are fleeing harassment or domestic violence, care or prison leavers and all 16 and 17 year olds. </p> <p>Working with local agencies to improve their housing services is another aim. Last month, a partnership scheme involving Centrepoint, Exeter Homeless Action Group and East Devon Council for Voluntary Service was awarded a \u00a3240,000 national lottery grant to set up an emergency shelter for young people in Devon. Centrepoint believes this approach to local services is the way forward. </p> <p>A new management team will ensure the charity's operations are co-ordinated. Housing, national services and education will be covered by a director of services, while communications and fundraising will be overseen by a new director of marketing. A senior management group has been created beneath the new team, which Adebowale says will help \"share decision making and thinking\". He believes these changes will free more resources to address the needs of the charity's changing client group. \"We are seeing younger people, more women and more minority ethnic groups. We need to take time to study these areas in detail,\" he says. Later this year, the charity will launch a campaign to highlight the rise in female homelessness. </p> <p>Given the current climate for service cuts and charity mergers, Adebowale is all too aware that Centrepoint will be under pressure from funders and others to show that it still has a unique role to play in tackling homelessness. \"If Centrepoint were to close its projects in London tomorrow, people would notice the difference. Our services are critical to society's health. We have to retain that edge.\" </p> <p>Patronage by the Princess of Wales propelled Centrepoint into the media's glare and by the time of her death in 1997, it had become a household name. \"We suffer because we are not a large charity, but people think we are richer and larger than we really are,\" says Adebowale. \"We need to be doing what we say on the tin.\"</p>",

At least half the young people using Centrepoint facilities are now young girls or women, and the charity says increasing numbers of black and ethnic young people are using its services. Addressing these changes is high on Centrepoint's agenda. In addition, the charity has until now focused on housing and preventative work. A key aim of its new, five-year plan is to strengthen its follow-through work with young people, in areas like life skills, access to training and job search. Chief executive Victor Adebowale believes this will result in the charity providing a more holistic service to young people. \"The provision of housing is not going to work unless we have a package of employment and training measures in place,\" he says. \"How do you provide services to a young person who's been kicked out of home when one in seven has difficulty reading and writing, and 25% have experience of the care system - and so could be emotionally damaged?\" Adebowale suggests this strategy fits into the government's own approach to education and employment for young people. \"The challenge is to deepen, not abandon, our involvement in housing. We want to build on to that effective employment and training.\" Meeting its current responsibilities cost Centrepoint about \u00a39m last year. In 1999, just over a third of its income came from donations, just under a third from statutory grants and some 20% from rents and charges (the charity is a registered social landlord). General reserves are virtually non-existent following a period of rapid expansion. Faced with a fundraising target of \u00a33m this year, Centrepoint has taken the view that partnerships are the only way to deliver its new aims. \"We don't pretend that we can complete this work on our own,\" admits Adebowale.\" Centrepoint already works with partners like the Peabody Trust to give young people training and career advice. As well as expanding this work, the charity also wants to talk to local authorities in light of the housing green paper's proposals on providing housing services for the young. These include extending local authority \"priority\" areas to cover people who are fleeing harassment or domestic violence, care or prison leavers and all 16 and 17 year olds. Working with local agencies to improve their housing services is another aim. Last month, a partnership scheme involving Centrepoint, Exeter Homeless Action Group and East Devon Council for Voluntary Service was awarded a \u00a3240,000 national lottery grant to set up an emergency shelter for young people in Devon. Centrepoint believes this approach to local services is the way forward. A new management team will ensure the charity's operations are co-ordinated. Housing, national services and education will be covered by a director of services, while communications and fundraising will be overseen by a new director of marketing. A senior management group has been created beneath the new team, which Adebowale says will help \"share decision making and thinking\". He believes these changes will free more resources to address the needs of the charity's changing client group. \"We are seeing younger people, more women and more minority ethnic groups. We need to take time to study these areas in detail,\" he says. Later this year, the charity will launch a campaign to highlight the rise in female homelessness. Given the current climate for service cuts and charity mergers, Adebowale is all too aware that Centrepoint will be under pressure from funders and others to show that it still has a unique role to play in tackling homelessness. \"If Centrepoint were to close its projects in London tomorrow, people would notice the difference. Our services are critical to society's health. We have to retain that edge.\" Patronage by the Princess of Wales propelled Centrepoint into the media's glare and by the time of her death in 1997, it had become a household name. \"We suffer because we are not a large charity, but people think we are richer and larger than we really are,\" says Adebowale. \"We need to be doing what we say on the tin.\"",

Yet this unpromising patch of turf has sprouted towering stadiums, and will host the 27th Olympiad, billed as the first \"green Games\". </p> <p>In 1993, Sydney was the first city to bid for the Games on a platform of green promises. That year, the International Olympic Committee adopted the environment as its third \"tier\", after sport and culture, and IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch announced that Sydney won the 2000 Games \"partly because of the consideration given to environmental matters\". </p> <p>But the detritus from Homebush Bay's industrial past - 9m cubic metres of asbestos, heavy metals, DDT and dioxins - was soon exposed. </p> <p>\"It's been a bloody nightmare in some ways,\" says Sydney 2000's environment communications manager Michael Bland. The Olympic Co-ordination Authority (OCA), funded by the New South Wales government, took Greenpeace's advice to treat the waste on site rather than dumping it elsewhere, and a A$150m (\u00a360m) clean-up operation began. The dioxins - a by-product of the chemical weapon, Agent Orange, manufactured in Sydney for the US to spray on Vietnam - were chemically broken down.

      "bodyText": "Homebush Bay, a messy scrap of land nine miles west of central Sydney, has a chequered past - home to a saltworks, a brick factory, an arms depot, an abattoir and three decades of the city's dirtiest waste. Yet this unpromising patch of turf has sprouted towering stadiums, and will host the 27th Olympiad, billed as the first \"green Games\". In 1993, Sydney was the first city to bid for the Games on a platform of green promises. That year, the International Olympic Committee adopted the environment as its third \"tier\", after sport and culture, and IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch announced that Sydney won the 2000 Games \"partly because of the consideration given to environmental matters\". But the detritus from Homebush Bay's industrial past - 9m cubic metres of asbestos, heavy metals, DDT and dioxins - was soon exposed. \"It's been a bloody nightmare in some ways,\" says Sydney 2000's environment communications manager Michael Bland. The Olympic Co-ordination Authority (OCA), funded by the New South Wales government, took Greenpeace's advice to treat the waste on site rather than dumping it elsewhere, and a A$150m (\u00a360m) clean-up operation began. The dioxins - a by-product of the chemical weapon, Agent Orange, manufactured in Sydney for the US to spray on Vietnam - were chemically broken down. Other waste was treated with innovative \"bio-remediation\" techniques, using plants to filter and feed on waste. Greenpeace accepts that the Olympic site is now safe. Alongside the clean-up of Homebush came a construction programme boasting many environmental initiatives, including a headline-grabbing preservation programme for the endangered green and golden bell frog discovered hopping around the old brickworks.

And there is provision for Hindu, Buddhist and even non-religious funerals. </p> <p>Death is big business: beyond the tidying away of mortal remains, a whole sector grows and flourishes. Care of the dying has become a medical and nursing specialism: there is the hospice movement, professional bereavement counsellors and support groups for sufferers (and their relatives) of many terminal diseases. In academia, meanwhile, \"death studies\" is the label given to a range of courses on offer at several universities. </p> <p>You can get an idea of this range from the list of experts attending an international conference on death, dying and \"disposal\", starting tomorrow at Goldsmith's College in south London.

His paper will look at how mass drownings in the Thames, such as the sinking of the Marchioness, have been handled in different eras. </p> <p>\"A lot of work is being done on how death impacts on the living,\" Spence says. \"If it is studied as an event, it doesn't feel particularly significant.\" Another speaker, the sociologist Tony Walter, says: \"There is a market in people wanting to know about the process of dying; how you deal with the knowledge that you've not much time left.\" </p> <p>Walter, who runs an MA course in death studies at Reading university, is focusing on the way we react to bereavement: we divide pretty clearly, it seems, between those who keep a stiff upper lip and those who give full vent to their sorrow. There is no right way, but he argues that there is a need for people to be given guidance on how best to cope with loss. </p> <p>Surprisingly, more of us - even churchgoers - are turning to mediums. This is a departure from the customary view that only Christianity can mediate between the living and the departed. Walter says we are increasingly \"mixing and matching\" from a wide spectrum of beliefs and traditions. \"Going to a medium isn't supposed to happen. It's like a big secret. But it does happen; especially [among] bereaved parents.\" </p> <p>Help in more tangible form is being given to mothers who miscarry early in pregnancy and who have often been told by doctors, perhaps insensitively, that the best way to recover is to have another baby. The numbers are considerable: Jenny Littlewood, a psychologist in the faculty of health at South Bank university, London, points out that one in six pregnancies in the capital ends in a miscarriage within three months. </p> <p>Littlewood is highlighting a fascinating, shadowy area of appropriate ways of, as she puts it, \"negotiating foetal loss and disposing of a 'nobody'\". The foetus is in a sort of limbo. The position, she explains, is this: \"The medico-legal definition of life is from 24 weeks. Scans are performed from 16 weeks routinely. A foetal heart can be seen from six weeks. If the foetus miscarries before 24 weeks, there is no death certification. Funerals may be provided from 16 weeks.\" </p> <p>The former practice of sluicing away as medical waste very young foetuses was distressing for nurses and doctors, not to say parents, and has led to guidelines that take account of the moral and legal position. </p> <p>With a very early miscarriage, parents might be confused as to whether there is a being to mourn. Littlewood observes that it is now the practice for midwives or nurses to lay a foetus on its side, with joined hands placed between pillow and head, suggesting peaceful repose. \"They're often too small to be dressed in clothes which the parents bring,\" she says. </p> <p>With parental permission, staff will take a photograph of the dead foetus and offer it to the parents as a memento. Some mothers and fathers, Littlewood has been told, are too distressed to accept the photo at the time; others return later to ask for it to help them come to terms with the loss. </p> <p>Hospital mortuaries now keep foetuses either until there is a funeral (when parents sometimes put pictures of themselves into the tiny casket) or until disposal is arranged. In the case of very early miscarriages, parents may ask the hospital to take care of distressing matters - which means disposal, though not with medical waste as was often the way in the past. </p> <p>There can, however, be more positive outcomes.

Colette Kelleher, director of the Daycare Trust, is to join the Department for Education and Employment (DfEE) as an adviser on early years development and child care partnerships. </p> <p>Her switch is the latest in a series, including those of Maeve Sherlock, who has left the leadership of the National Council for One Parent Families to join the Treasury's council of economic advisers, and of Balbir Chatrik, who has gone on secondment from the Unemployment Unit and Youthaid to help develop the DfEE's new children and young people's unit. </p> <p>Kelleher, 38, has been the Daycare Trust's director since 1996. She has been instrumental in getting child care on to the mainstream political agenda and ensuring government action to improve Britain's poor provision. </p> <p>She says: \"Much has been done, but there is a much longer way to go before we achieve child care for all. There is still a child care gap, with groups including parents with children under three, children living in poverty, shiftworking parents and studying parents missing out. </p> <p>\"Child care staff are still underpaid and undervalued. Child care costs remain a stumbling block for those falling outside the child care tax credit. Sustainability and quality remain key concerns. The vast majority of employers are not making any contribution to child care.\" </p> <p>The Daycare Trust is advertising today for Kelleher's replacement. On the one hand, her recruitment is a feather in the group's hat. On the other, though, the upheaval caused by her loss will bring problems - however able her successor turns out to be. </p> <p>Paul Convery is, with Chatrik, joint director of the merged Unemployment Unit and Youthaid. He says there is a noticeable trend in the way Labour is now plucking seasoned voluntary sector talent after initially recruiting advisers who had little on-the-ground experience. While it makes good sense for ministers, they need to consider the consequences for the groups concerned. </p> <p>\"I have seen voluntary organisations who have taken quite a hit,\" says Convery. \"It's great for the government, but it can often have quite an effect on the people left behind. The government possibly needs to go a little bit further in helping underpin an organisation from which they have taken the top talent.\" </p> <p>It is, nonetheless, a two-way street. Having a former director, or secondee, in Whitehall can do no harm to a campaign group. \"It can be tremendously valuable in terms of insights and a sense of how Whitehall works,\" admits Convery, stressing that Chatrik has of course betrayed no state secrets.</p>",

Her switch is the latest in a series, including those of Maeve Sherlock, who has left the leadership of the National Council for One Parent Families to join the Treasury's council of economic advisers, and of Balbir Chatrik, who has gone on secondment from the Unemployment Unit and Youthaid to help develop the DfEE's new children and young people's unit. Kelleher, 38, has been the Daycare Trust's director since 1996. She has been instrumental in getting child care on to the mainstream political agenda and ensuring government action to improve Britain's poor provision. She says: \"Much has been done, but there is a much longer way to go before we achieve child care for all. There is still a child care gap, with groups including parents with children under three, children living in poverty, shiftworking parents and studying parents missing out. \"Child care staff are still underpaid and undervalued. Child care costs remain a stumbling block for those falling outside the child care tax credit. Sustainability and quality remain key concerns. The vast majority of employers are not making any contribution to child care.\" The Daycare Trust is advertising today for Kelleher's replacement. On the one hand, her recruitment is a feather in the group's hat. On the other, though, the upheaval caused by her loss will bring problems - however able her successor turns out to be. Paul Convery is, with Chatrik, joint director of the merged Unemployment Unit and Youthaid. He says there is a noticeable trend in the way Labour is now plucking seasoned voluntary sector talent after initially recruiting advisers who had little on-the-ground experience. While it makes good sense for ministers, they need to consider the consequences for the groups concerned. \"I have seen voluntary organisations who have taken quite a hit,\" says Convery. \"It's great for the government, but it can often have quite an effect on the people left behind. The government possibly needs to go a little bit further in helping underpin an organisation from which they have taken the top talent.\" It is, nonetheless, a two-way street. Having a former director, or secondee, in Whitehall can do no harm to a campaign group. \"It can be tremendously valuable in terms of insights and a sense of how Whitehall works,\" admits Convery, stressing that Chatrik has of course betrayed no state secrets.",

St Mo would be the ideal candidate - after all, she has plenty of experience of a job where people are always knifing you in the back. But Media Monkey would welcome other suggestions... \"Nasty\" Nick snapped Media Monkey is certain the Sun, as the official Big Brother newspaper, will be gagging to get its hands on some photos reportedly doing the rounds, which show \"Nasty\" Nick Bateman in his first public clinch with a member of the opposite sex since being evicted from the house of two-way mirrors. The offending snaps, taken outside the Met Bar after the TV Quick awards on Tuesday night (September 4), are said to feature Nick in a warm embrace with, er... go-getting Sun TV reporter Emily Smith. All in the line of duty, no doubt. Sky's the limit Does the low cunning of the BSkyB marketing department know no bounds? Imagine little Johnnie and Jemima's delight when, after a spot of bulletin reading courtesy of Sky News during their visit to the Millennium Dome, they are given a videotape of the performance to take home and treasure.

Charlotte can rattle off a long list of other complaints about high-rise living on the edge of Glasgow city centre. But like many tenants battered by bureaucracy's apparent inability to tackle basic repairs, she has given up hope.</p> <p>Even scaffolding, clamped to the side of the crumbling 60s structure, in a belated stab at installing double glazing, fails to impress the 22-year-old. \"They should knock this lot down instead of putting all these windows in,\" she says, a faint smile betraying deepening resignation. \"Everything here is bad, really bad. It's like the house that Jack built, freezing in the winter and damp in the summer. I hope to get out soon -to England.\" </p> <p>Across what passes for a square in the St George's Cross district, littered with rubble and broken glass (\"more wear and tear than vandalism - don't blame the weans [children],\" sighs a middle-aged woman) Gordon Dodd is walking his six-year-old son home in the late evening. While his low-rise flat nearby is in slightly better repair - \"although heating would be nice\" - he is under no illusions about the scale of the problem facing Britain's biggest council landlord. \"To be honest, half the houses in Glasgow need to be bulldozed and rebuilt. These big blocks of flats [the city has 150] are no use to man or beast. They're in a terrible condition.\" </p> <p>A mile away, surveying the city from his new office in Glasgow's business quarter, the man charged with sorting out a housing crisis would not disagree. \"The stock is in a hellish condition and everyone realises it is not fit for the 21st century, for the dignity of people who want to stay in their homes,\" admits Bob Allan, chief executive of the embryonic Glasgow Housing Association (GHA) and former head of a nearby local authority. \"It's saddled with debt, dampness, cold, poor electrics - everything far worse than the UK average.\" </p> <p>After years of defensiveness, no one in authority disputes that the city's 94,000 council flats and houses are among the worst in Britain. Only a quarter reach acceptable standards, while a further quarter are seen as \"saveable\". The remaining 50%, in areas like St George's Cross and elsewhere, are in such poor condition that they face an uncertain future in a city which, because of low demand, has been demolishing 2,300 council houses annually since 1993. </p> <p>Saddled with a housing debt approaching \u00a31bn and facing a repairs backlog of \u00a31.2bn for stock deteriorating by the day, Glasgow city council has thrown ideology to the wind. Memories of that old political cliche, Red Clydeside, may still linger in older hearts; after all, the government in 1919, fearing a Bolshevik uprising, put tanks on the streets outside the city chambers. </p> <p>But now the Labour pragmatists running the city chambers have decided to get rid of that monument to municipal socialism - council housing. In a move certain to set the pace for big English cities - notably Birmingham - it is preparing to hand over its entire stock to Allan's housing association next year, provided tenants vote \"yes\" in a city-wide ballot. </p> <p>The move has become a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for the Scottish executive and the young minister for communities, Wendy Alexander, whose enthusiasm and direct involvement - she co-chairs a steering group with councillors - has clearly ruffled feathers in the marbled city chambers. </p> <p>\"We have an opportunity to create a new, positive spirit in many communities,\" Alexander has said. \"From initial soundings with tenants' groups there is a genuine desire for constructive change. Tenants will lead the way throughout the entire process . . . this will be for the people of Glasgow, by the people of Glasgow.\" </p> <p>As part of the deal with the council, the executive has agreed to go one step further than its Whitehall equivalent by servicing Glasgow's housing debt from its own funds. Free of this financial albatross, the emerging GHA would then set about tackling the repairs backlog and (in Allan's words) \"rebuilding communities\". As debt repayment accounts for half the average weekly rent of \u00a345, this is no mean subsidy. </p> <p>The other attraction for the council, target of constant sniping from disgruntled tenants, is that housing associations, unlike local authorities, can get loans from banks and building societies - using the income stream from rents as collateral. As a result, the council hopes that institutions, including possibly the European Investment Bank, will help raise around \u00a31.6bn over 10 years to smarten up what remains of the former municipal stock. </p> <p>Both Alexander and the council are adamant that the GHA must be a non-profit making mutual association, controlled by communities and not by businessmen. After the ballot, the idea is to shift control to some 14 area organisations - and eventually fur ther down the chain to smaller associations of about 500 houses each. </p> <p>But assurances of mutuality have failed to halt criticism that the housing transfer smacks of backdoor privatisation. Tommy Sheridan, a Scottish Socialist Party councillor and a member of the Scottish Parliament, says opposition will match the great anti-poll tax campaign, which he led in the late 1980s. \"This will develop into a very bitter and bloody battle,\" he insists. \"There is a tremendous amount of fear. For the first time in modern history, Glasgow will be left without a council house if this goes through.\" </p> <p>Sean Clerkin, who chairs a Glasgow-wide campaign against stock transfer, claims the plan is not only a \"test bed for council house privatisation throughout the UK\", but also an issue which could seal Alexander's fate as a minister. \"It will either be her big success story,\" he says, \"or the noose that hangs her because she's that closely associated with it.\" </p> <p> Charlie Gordon, Labour leader of Glasgow, accepts the issue is so emotive that the council and the Scottish executive have some way to go in convincing 94,000 tenants. He says: \"There is a folk memory in Glasgow of what it was like renting from private landlords and older people [over a quarter of tenants are pensioners] remember exploitation and the rest of it.\" </p> <p>If a ballot were held tomorrow -rather than next year - Gordon accepts that the plan would be overwhelmingly rejected. \"This is a process and we are still in the early stages,\" he says, accusing opponents of being \"politically motivated dogmatists\", unwilling to accept plans for \"another form of social ownership\". </p> <p>Others are not so restrained. In a recent newsletter, produced on behalf of the council and the Scottish executive, critics were accused of feeding Glaswegians \"a diet of fear, half-truths and misinformation\" about rocketing rents, widespread redundancies, and privatisation. </p> <p>But with more than 2,000 staff in the housing department, and a further 3,000 employed by the council's direct labour organisation (DLO) - mainly on council house repairs - job losses are clearly a fear. That is why the Scottish TUC is opposed to the scheme, although job assurances, and a commitment to give a contract to the DLO after the transfer, will be given. Allan's next step will be formally to present a transfer package to the council by the end of the year, outlining investment and rent levels, the structure of his organisation and tenancy agreements. If the authority accepts, plans for a ballot will be set in train. </p> <p>To win hearts and minds, he says publicity material will have to be free of hype and spin. \"We have to do this in an honest and open way rather than as a smart piece of salesmanship.\" In the end, he believes they will get a \"yes\". \"But we will have to work hard for it.\" </p> <p>One thing is clear.

Charlotte can rattle off a long list of other complaints about high-rise living on the edge of Glasgow city centre. But like many tenants battered by bureaucracy's apparent inability to tackle basic repairs, she has given up hope. Even scaffolding, clamped to the side of the crumbling 60s structure, in a belated stab at installing double glazing, fails to impress the 22-year-old. \"They should knock this lot down instead of putting all these windows in,\" she says, a faint smile betraying deepening resignation. \"Everything here is bad, really bad. It's like the house that Jack built, freezing in the winter and damp in the summer. I hope to get out soon -to England.\" Across what passes for a square in the St George's Cross district, littered with rubble and broken glass (\"more wear and tear than vandalism - don't blame the weans [children],\" sighs a middle-aged woman) Gordon Dodd is walking his six-year-old son home in the late evening. While his low-rise flat nearby is in slightly better repair - \"although heating would be nice\" - he is under no illusions about the scale of the problem facing Britain's biggest council landlord. \"To be honest, half the houses in Glasgow need to be bulldozed and rebuilt. These big blocks of flats [the city has 150] are no use to man or beast. They're in a terrible condition.\" A mile away, surveying the city from his new office in Glasgow's business quarter, the man charged with sorting out a housing crisis would not disagree. \"The stock is in a hellish condition and everyone realises it is not fit for the 21st century, for the dignity of people who want to stay in their homes,\" admits Bob Allan, chief executive of the embryonic Glasgow Housing Association (GHA) and former head of a nearby local authority. \"It's saddled with debt, dampness, cold, poor electrics - everything far worse than the UK average.\" After years of defensiveness, no one in authority disputes that the city's 94,000 council flats and houses are among the worst in Britain. Only a quarter reach acceptable standards, while a further quarter are seen as \"saveable\". The remaining 50%, in areas like St George's Cross and elsewhere, are in such poor condition that they face an uncertain future in a city which, because of low demand, has been demolishing 2,300 council houses annually since 1993.

      "body": "<p>Through the fog of today's endless repeats, tacky game shows and trashy films, a golden age of British television shone yesterday when jaded writers, producers and critics turned back the decades to identify the all-time smallscreen greats. </p> <p>In a list of 100 television programmes picked for the British Film Institute, the most recent of the top 10 was first shown in 1982. The greatest television programme in broadcasting history was named as Fawlty Towers, currently enjoying prime-time exposure on BBC1. </p> <p>As the BBC struggles to redefine itself in the digital age, the corporation could take comfort in the knowledge that it is still regarded as a powerhouse of quality programmes: 72 of the top 100 were BBC shows. The first three in the list, Fawlty Towers, Cathy Come Home and Doctor Who, were all seminal moments in modern cultural history. </p> <p>While more contemporary programmes figured lower down in the poll - perhaps reflecting the perspective of the voters rather than the quality of the shows - it is clear that broadcasting brilliance is still within the grasp of TV creatives. </p> <p><strong> Changing nature</strong><br> Yet, in an illustration of the changing nature of broadcasting, many of today's hits have come from outside the big broadcasting institutions - the Royle Family sitcom (31st in the list) was written by Caroline Aherne and Craig Cash before it was picked up by Granada and sold to the BBC; the game show Who Wants to be a Millionaire? (23rd) came to ITV from the then little-known production house Celador; and the Wallace and Gromit animation The Wrong Trousers (18th) was picked up by the BBC from Aardman productions. </p> <p>Our Friends in the North (25th) stood out as one of the few truly in-house modern BBC dramas in the top 50. </p> <p>Joan Bakewell, the broadcaster and chairwoman of the BFI, said many of today's shows would be regarded as classics in the future. \"Nostalgia plays a large part in people's love for programmes. As they recede into the past, you forget their faults. It conjures up a time in our lives when we were less stressed, younger and life was easier.\" </p> <p>The BFI polled 1,600 programme makers, critics and executives with a list of around 600 suggested programmes to choose from - voters could add their own - and just over a quarter replied. They came up with five shows from the 1950s, the first significant television decade, and between 22 and 25 from the next 40 years. </p> <p>Gerry Anderson, creator of Thunderbirds (60th), said of the poll: \"It either says that people have fond memories of the past, or it says today's television programmes are lousy. There are so many repeats now, and you have to search around to find something different.\" </p> <p>The top children's programme was Blue Peter (6th), which started in 1958. It is also the show with the most editions ever produced. Peter Purves, a former presenter, said its enduring appeal was due to the range of issues it covered. </p> <p>\"The items are about three or four minutes long, maybe five at the most if it's a film from Africa or somewhere, and in a 25-minute show that means six or seven elements, so if you didn't like one, there would be something else along soon. The concept gelled, and after 42 years, they must be doing something right.\" </p> <p>Douglas Argent, one of the producers of Fawlty Towers, said its lasting appeal was down to the writers, Connie Booth and John Cleese. \"Fawlty was such an anti-hero. Everyone agreed with him.

      "bodyText": "Through the fog of today's endless repeats, tacky game shows and trashy films, a golden age of British television shone yesterday when jaded writers, producers and critics turned back the decades to identify the all-time smallscreen greats. In a list of 100 television programmes picked for the British Film Institute, the most recent of the top 10 was first shown in 1982. The greatest television programme in broadcasting history was named as Fawlty Towers, currently enjoying prime-time exposure on BBC1. As the BBC struggles to redefine itself in the digital age, the corporation could take comfort in the knowledge that it is still regarded as a powerhouse of quality programmes: 72 of the top 100 were BBC shows. The first three in the list, Fawlty Towers, Cathy Come Home and Doctor Who, were all seminal moments in modern cultural history. While more contemporary programmes figured lower down in the poll - perhaps reflecting the perspective of the voters rather than the quality of the shows - it is clear that broadcasting brilliance is still within the grasp of TV creatives. Changing nature Yet, in an illustration of the changing nature of broadcasting, many of today's hits have come from outside the big broadcasting institutions - the Royle Family sitcom (31st in the list) was written by Caroline Aherne and Craig Cash before it was picked up by Granada and sold to the BBC; the game show Who Wants to be a Millionaire? (23rd) came to ITV from the then little-known production house Celador; and the Wallace and Gromit animation The Wrong Trousers (18th) was picked up by the BBC from Aardman productions. Our Friends in the North (25th) stood out as one of the few truly in-house modern BBC dramas in the top 50. Joan Bakewell, the broadcaster and chairwoman of the BFI, said many of today's shows would be regarded as classics in the future. \"Nostalgia plays a large part in people's love for programmes. As they recede into the past, you forget their faults. It conjures up a time in our lives when we were less stressed, younger and life was easier.\" The BFI polled 1,600 programme makers, critics and executives with a list of around 600 suggested programmes to choose from - voters could add their own - and just over a quarter replied. They came up with five shows from the 1950s, the first significant television decade, and between 22 and 25 from the next 40 years. Gerry Anderson, creator of Thunderbirds (60th), said of the poll: \"It either says that people have fond memories of the past, or it says today's television programmes are lousy. There are so many repeats now, and you have to search around to find something different.\" The top children's programme was Blue Peter (6th), which started in 1958. It is also the show with the most editions ever produced. Peter Purves, a former presenter, said its enduring appeal was due to the range of issues it covered. \"The items are about three or four minutes long, maybe five at the most if it's a film from Africa or somewhere, and in a 25-minute show that means six or seven elements, so if you didn't like one, there would be something else along soon. The concept gelled, and after 42 years, they must be doing something right.\" Douglas Argent, one of the producers of Fawlty Towers, said its lasting appeal was down to the writers, Connie Booth and John Cleese. \"Fawlty was such an anti-hero. Everyone agreed with him. The scripts were extremely good, each one had a strong singular plot.\" Soap opera He said that few sitcoms today came up to the same standards. \"The Royle Family is the one thing that stands out in the past four or five years.\" The problem, he said, was that there were few good writers penning quality comedy scripts. \"It's just the writers, I suppose. You sink or swim by your script.\" Only one soap opera featured in the list - Coronation Street (40th). Some observers were surprised at its position, and the absence of the BBC's EastEnders. Paul Merton, whose quiz show Have I Got News for You came 70th, said the Street should have won. \"It has always done well in the ratings and it broke the mould of British television,\" he said. \"It was the first time that working-class, northern people were shown on TV.\" Granada, the soap's producer, was the most represented independent broadcaster in the list. Michael Parkinson, who introduced the poll at a ceremony in London yesterday, and whose BBC chat show came eighth, said: \"I think it shows British television is very strong.

      "bodyText": "The broadcaster and award-winning documentary film-maker, Desmond Wilcox, died in hospital early today. Wilcox, 69, died at St Mary's Hospital in London in the early hours of this morning, his wife Esther Rantzen said. He had suffered from coronary heart disease for many years and undergone two heart bypass operations. Rantzen said: \"I had 32 of the best years of my life with him. He radiated warmth and light into our lives and for the moment we fear that we have lost the sunshine we depended on.\" She added that her husband had wished for some of his organs to be used to help others, a gesture that was typical of \"an extraordinary caring and giving man\". Wilcox began his career in journalism as a reporter on a weekly newspaper in 1949, following a spell in the merchant navy. In 1960 he moved to television as a reporter on ITV's This Week current affairs programme, where he stayed for five years until joining the BBC. But it was for the BBC that he was to make his mark with his highly-regarded documentary-making. He was co-editor and presenter of the landmark Man Alive series in 1965, pioneering some innovative documentary techniques, and formed the Man Alive Unit three years later. From 1972 to 1980 Wilcox was head of general features at the BBC and went on to make series such as Americans, The Visit, Black in Blue and A Day in the Life. His series of six documentaries about David Jackson - the boy without a face - garnered five international awards. Wilcox was also a long-standing member of the Bafta council.",

But in the light of the extra \u00a347m of lottery money given to the dome yesterday by the millennium commission, the company was seeking urgent clarification of the dome's financial state. Nomura said it had not been officially informed of the latest cash injection. \"It came as news to us, we were shocked and amazed,\" said Mr Dowler. \"Two things surprised us - the \u00a347m cash handout and the announcement of the projection of visitor figures of 4.5m from the expected 7m.\" Mr Dowler did not say if the fall in projected visitors would affect the sale. In a statement to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the finance group said: \"We haven't signed anything yet.\" Nomura's comments follow a torrent of criticism from politicians of all parties over the latest financial bale-out at Greenwich. Opposition leader William Hague condemned the project, saying, \"I am calling on the prime minister to do four things immediately. \"Mr Blair should close down the dome today; he should fire his dome minister today; he should announce a full public inquiry into the dome scandal today; and he should transfer the money being wasted on the dome to real good causes such as cancer research - today.\" He continued: \"The time has come to turn off the tap and stop the vast waste of public money.

Both the commission and Lord Falconer have stressed that it would cost more to close the dome now than come up with the \u00a347m cash injection. Part of the new cash deal is a change in the dome's management, with troubleshooter David James - known as the \"company doctor\" for his ability to rescue ailing businesses - taking over as executive chairman. Speaking at press conference today, also attended by continuing chief executive Pierre-Yves Gerbeau, Mr James highlighted key failings in the dome's original implementation. These included difficulty of access to the site and an inadequate register of assets set up by the New Millennium Experience Company, rendering the Nomura sale more laborious. But he reiterated that shutting the dome was not an option, saying that an early closure would accrue between \u00a330m and \u00a340m in extra costs. \"I think that would be a very wrong decision.

One way or another, a national register of approved adopters and children ready for adoption looks on the cards. But how far should this go? </p> <p>A new, independent, national website on adoption and fostering, launched by Derbyshire county council and the Derby Evening Telegraph newspaper, is raising many of the difficult questions that any official model will face. In particular, is it acceptable to publish on the internet photographs and details of children without restrictions on access? </p> <p>The precedent for the site was set last year when, amid a welter of publicity, pictures and details of six Derbyshire children were posted on the web as an experiment. The response was overwhelming, with the site registering 19,000 visits in four days from potential and approved adopters. The council had to employ extra staff to deal with the applications. All the children found prospective parents and two are now with their new families. </p> <p>The permanent site launched this summer, adoption-net.co.uk, provides a comprehensive overview of adoption, fostering and child welfare across the country. It offers advice ranging from how to become an adoptive parent, to dealing with a difficult child, to even tracing a relative lost through adoption. </p> <p>\"I would hope this is the way forward,\" says David Allen, who chairs Derbyshire social services. \"Adoption can be a long, arduous process both for the adult and the child. Our aim is to keep bureaucracy to a minimum and so speed up that process. We can provide all the necessary information for someone wishing to adopt. Should they need to get in touch with a particular agency, we will have the contact number. In conjunction with the government, we want to see children adopted sooner rather than later, and not fostered for years.\" </p> <p>The site has recently been carrying a picture and profile of 11-year-old Heather, who has been in care for five years and is said to be seeking an adoptive family. </p> <p>Allen, who was criticised during last year's experiment, acknowledges the concerns of using such methods. \"Obviously anyone can access the site, and people's fears regarding paedophiles are understandable,\" he says. \"Safeguarding children is our main priority, but in terms of potential adopters, the police conduct thorough checks [as part of the vetting procedure] before applications are taken any further.\" </p> <p>Allen also refutes the suggestion that the site is merely a picture gallery, promoting a \"pick-your-child\" ethos. \"We show children as ordinary people, in need of love and stability,\" he insists. \"They must consent to appear on the site, and no child under the age of eight is put on. We make sure they are happy to be featured.\" </p> <p>It is a view that will do little to dispel the misgivings of those who question this approach. But Mike Norton, the deputy editor of the Evening Telegraph, insists that the new website is an effective adoption tool. </p> <p>He says: \"When the site appeared last year, we realised how many more parents there were available for adoption. The system as it is just isn't working, as not enough parents are being found. </p> <p>\"The problem lies in the fact that social services departments don't talk to each other. For instance, a parent in Derby could be perfect for a child in Nottingham, but this may not come to light. Accordingly, the site doesn't recognise any county barriers. </p> <p>\"There isn't a lot of information about adopting elsewhere on the web. So if a parent in Sussex wants more information about organisations there, we will have the details.\" </p> <p>In this respect, Norton views the site as a gate-opener, providing guidelines and up-to-the-minute information and news. \"If the government announces a press release today,\" he says, \"it goes on the site today\". </p> <p>While welcoming any initiative that expedites the adoption process, Felicity Collier, the chief executive of British Agencies for Adopting and Fostering, remains concerned by the abuse of information that both the internet and a national register might promote. </p> <p>\"Paedophiles surfing the net and accessing kids is a worrying scenario for us all,\" she says. \"And before we have an explosion of children on the web, we need more guidelines. A password-encrypted site of approved carers would, to my mind, be essential. A child being recognised in the street is problematic, as it may invite advances from other people. </p> <p>\"And if the child has, say, a love of horses, a stranger could use this in conversation. The particular use of words could also be embarrassing for a child. If he or she is described as being bad-tempered or destructive, this is no help to the child at all. Whether incorporated into a website or a national register, this issue must be addressed.\" </p> <p>However, Collier does highlight an area where a national register could have a positive impact. She says: \"If it provides for the matching with adopters of children in terms of a disability or their ethnicity, that would be most welcome.\" </p> <p> Her views are echoed by Sue Seabrook, adoption project leader for the Children's Society charity. \"We don't know how a national register will work, but a detailed infrastructure will have to be put into place,\" she says. </p> <p>\"However, since local authorities looking to place children usually look within their own resources first, a national database, and possibly the internet, might facilitate the process. But webs need good security as paedophiles are very clever and devious. They will use any methods to get to children, so using photographs on a site is a worry.\" </p> <p>With figures showing more than 5,000 children in England waiting to be adopted, and 1,300 people cleared to adopt but still waiting for a child, Seabrook is keen to give technology a chance. And if it enables more people to learn about adoption, and possibly offer themselves as adopters, so much the better. But she insists that the procedures must still take time. </p> <p>\"Whatever the methods used, the vetting of families remains a difficult and sensitive process,\" she says. \"It's a real task to look after some kids, particularly those who have had traumatic experiences. </p> <p>\"However, you have to be positive, and hope that these initiatives will help more children find loving homes.\"</p>",

And in a world where media consolidation and vertical integration of content and distribution is the new corporate mantra, there are those who argue that indies must grow or sell out to the big battalions to survive. </p> <p>Despite all the digital crystal ball-gazing, Shaun Williams, chief executive of Pact, the body representing more than 1,000 producers, reckons Channel 4 will remain the most important outlet for the majority of his members, provided the broadcaster's public-service remit is not thrown out with privatisation. Last year the channel commissioned work from more than 400 independents. But with the BBC looking to boost in-house production and further ITV consolidation under way, Williams admits there is a \"colder climate\" out there. \"In the short term that could make life pretty difficult for indies,\" he adds. \"But that is what the independent production quota is there for.\"</p> <p>Williams says there are now three types of producer. Broadcaster/producers such as the BBC and Granada; studio and production-village operations, where indies - including Planet 24, TalkBack, Ginger and Bazal - continue to operate as partly or wholly owned subsidiaries of larger media companies; and genuine independent producers. \"The ecology of the independent sector is very mixed,\" he says. \"You've got the TalkBacks and Bazals punching their weight around the world, then there are small operations also doing very well. The market is tougher, but it's healthy.\"</p> <p>Andrew Bethell, who runs Double Exposure, an indie specialising in factual and educational output, reports that the business \"feels tougher\" - an observation backed up by the experience of four or five similarly placed indies he knows. Double Exposure got in at the start of the mid-90s docu-soap boom with BBC2's critical and ratings success, The House. But Bethell says \"traditional\" commissions like this are now tougher to get. \"The work is gravitating towards bigger companies - the likes of Lion and RDF are sucking up factual stuff,\" he adds. \"They've got the volume of work, so they attract more executive producers.\"</p> <p>Double Exposure has diversified into other genres, and recently landed its first drama: a feature film adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's Kidnapped and its sequel, Catriona, that will go out on Channel 4. The company is also doing more international work for the likes of Discovery and CNN, and developing what Bethell believes is a strong multimedia idea.</p> <p>But multimedia is \"jam tomorrow stuff\" and in the end, he says not much has changed. \"It's all about the TV commissions you can generate,\" Bethell concludes. \"If you're on a roll, with 10 shows in production, you can generate some cashflow and it's OK. But if not, you don't have the money to expand.\"</p> <p>RDF managing director David Frank strikes a similar note, saying that as a business, TV production is \"not very attractive - the margins are low and terms are dictated by the broadcasters\" in the current regulatory framework. But RDF is staying in programme-making, Frank says, because the \"new-media market will expand opportunities\".</p> <p>RDF has expanded rapidly in the past three years, moving beyond its core factual business into drama and entertainment. The firm is drawing up a new three-year plan for further expansion and looking for minority equity partners to provide capital. Looking ahead, Frank reckons that digital multi-channel TV will increase the demand for high- and low-cost programming. </p> <p>Increasing the number of TV outlets will also erode the negotiating position of the terrestrial broadcasters, allowing indies to negotiate better terms of trade and \"escape the existing master-slave relationship\". In the longer term - three to five years - Frank sees opportunities arising in interactive TV and indies becoming digital channel or service providers. </p> <p>The downside of digital, according to Frank, is that the growth of media outlets will hit terrestrial broadcasters' advertising revenue and lead to shrinking programme budgets. He also believes that only the 20 or so biggest existing indies have the infrastructure and range of content skills to take full advantage of the digital market - \"Our biggest calling card is that we're a supplier of a wide range of programmes.\"</p> <p>Tiger Aspect Productions is one of the indie sector's biggest players. But while managing director Charles Brand admits that the outfit is \"much more businesslike\" than five or 10 years ago, he says being a big indie brings its own headaches. \"If your business doubles in size, so do your bills,\" Brand adds. \"You still don't know that you're going to have the commissions in a year's time to cover the higher cost base.\"</p> <p>He says the key to continuing success is to keep on attracting the best talent - starting with producers, who bring in other talent. \"TV commissions and the domestic market are absolutely still the heart and soul of our business. But what you have to do with our size is look at new ways of using the skills and talent in the company, whether in new media, international formats, or sponsored programming.\"</p> <p>The other option, of course, is to grow by merging with other indies or by selling out to a larger media player, as TalkBack did earlier this year, becoming a subsidiary of Pearson. Brand says the only reason for an indie to do this is \"if you believe it allows you to do what you do already - only even better\". </p> <p>But there are other pressures driving indie consolidation, according to Williams of Pact. \"Many believe that in the future you've either got to have scale or find a niche market,\" he declares. \"There are dangers for generalists.\"</p> <p>Williams suggests there is also a generational change taking place. \"The first generation of independent producers are reaching their early- to mid-50s and some are clearly looking to extract value from their companies before they retire,\" he says.</p> <p>\"But there's a new generation emerging with a much broader definition of what content is - not just linear TV but also enhanced TV, web design, even game design. The need for content is more than just a mantra - it's actually a key driver and I don't see a reversal in that.\"</p>",

But while managing director Charles Brand admits that the outfit is \"much more businesslike\" than five or 10 years ago, he says being a big indie brings its own headaches. \"If your business doubles in size, so do your bills,\" Brand adds. \"You still don't know that you're going to have the commissions in a year's time to cover the higher cost base.\" He says the key to continuing success is to keep on attracting the best talent - starting with producers, who bring in other talent. \"TV commissions and the domestic market are absolutely still the heart and soul of our business. But what you have to do with our size is look at new ways of using the skills and talent in the company, whether in new media, international formats, or sponsored programming.\" The other option, of course, is to grow by merging with other indies or by selling out to a larger media player, as TalkBack did earlier this year, becoming a subsidiary of Pearson. Brand says the only reason for an indie to do this is \"if you believe it allows you to do what you do already - only even better\". But there are other pressures driving indie consolidation, according to Williams of Pact. \"Many believe that in the future you've either got to have scale or find a niche market,\" he declares. \"There are dangers for generalists.\" Williams suggests there is also a generational change taking place. \"The first generation of independent producers are reaching their early- to mid-50s and some are clearly looking to extract value from their companies before they retire,\" he says. \"But there's a new generation emerging with a much broader definition of what content is - not just linear TV but also enhanced TV, web design, even game design. The need for content is more than just a mantra - it's actually a key driver and I don't see a reversal in that.\"",

So Al Murray is getting the chance to do his first TV series, without receiving the full glare of publicity that a BBC or ITV show would attract. For the BBC, losses such as Lynam and Skinner only reinforce the general feeling that the public-service broadcaster - with a flat income from the licence fee - stands to lose most in this more competitive marketplace (Lynam went to ITV in a four-year deal said to be worth \u00a35m). </p> <p>But it's not all doom and gloom, according to BBC controller of talent Rob Warr, who was appointed in late 1999 to improve talent relationships and lead a \u00a35m campaign to attract new faces to the corporation. Warr points to the \"greater breadth and depth\" of BBC services - talent can work across BBC1 and 2, five national radio stations, new digital services such as BBC Choice and UK Play, and the corporation's public-service and commercial websites. \"That's where I come in,\" Warr says. \"I bring all the disparate elements together.\"</p> <p>Warr highlights the League of Gentlemen deal, which involves a five-year plan working on projects across TV and radio. He adds that the BBC is also working to bring on younger talent such as Jamie Theakston, Katie Hill and Jamie Oliver, and breathing new life into the careers of older mainstream entertainers such as Rolf Harris, Michael Parkinson and Jim Davidson.</p> <p>Despite the increasing competition for talent, industry insiders agree that there is still only a relatively small pool of stars who have the clout to provoke bidding wars between broadcasters, or land big-money, exclusive deals. </p> <p>Andy Harries, controller of comedy and entertainment at Granada, says ITV is most likely to do exclusive deals, with the likes of John Thaw, Robson Green and, most recently, Sarah Lancashire, \"primarily to maintain its pre-eminence in drama - it is of huge value to ITV to keep these stars out of the market\". </p> <p>One of his BBC counterparts, Jon Plowman, explains that exclusive deals usually mean a broadcaster \"offering quite a lot of money and programming - giving the talent so much work that they won't want to go elsewhere\". But he believes that to have an exclusive deal without that volume of output attached, so that a star effectively \"paid not to work\", is a \"waste of money\".</p> <p>Some things do not change, acknowledges Grade: \"Hot talent has always been able to negotiate big money.\" The difference now, he says, is that canny agents and independent producers are expanding their businesses by using the clout of big names to negotiate deals for lesser-known talent on their roster.</p> <p>Grade suggests that the UK talent market is \"in transition\" from a situation where broadcasters signed up individual stars on a show-by-show basis, but has yet to reach the level of sophistication found in the US. \"In America, if you're a producer or agent with a hit show or property, you go to the network and do a deal not only for that, but also try to get a blind commitment for a number of other shows.\"</p> <p>But this system, Grade adds, has its dangers. For one thing, both sides tend to spend more time haggling over the deal than over the script. </p> <p>Grade suggests that the key difference lies in the roles played by talent agents on either side of the Atlantic. \"In the UK, agents are still very much client-orientated.

The nearest thing we've got to that here are independent producers.\" </p> <p>UK indies such as Avalon, which operates as a combined talent agency and producer and represents comedy clients including Murray, Skinner and David Baddiel, come closest to the US packaging model in this country. Some argue that agents getting into TV production makes good business sense. Not everyone is convinced. One experienced comedy producer says: \"I think in some cases the agent's view of what's best for the talent can get muddled with what's best for the agent's production company.\" Harries believes that most talent would actually rather not be tied into multi-series deals, preferring to have the freedom to choose between projects and broadcasters.</p> <p>Conversely, Plowman points out that talent deals often make sense for the broadcaster, ensuring that a star is on board for subsequent series if a show proves to be a hit.

Harries was involved in brokering a deal between Caroline Aherne and the BBC, following the early success of The Mrs Merton Show. The BBC wanted to sign the reluctant Aherne for two further series. She agreed, Harries says, but only because the BBC threw in an extra \u00a31.2m to make two series of a comedy that Aherne wanted to make \"in the spirit of Til Death Us Do Part\", which the corporation regarded as a \"sop to keep the star happy - a vanity project\". Thus the BBC got two series of The Royle Family for a knock-down \u00a3200,000 an episode. Granada is rumoured to be asking for \u00a3900,000 an episode for the third run. On the other hand, in April 1996 the BBC began a new four-year output deal with Noel Edmonds that called for his production company Unique to deliver 22 episodes of Noel's House Party in the first year for \u00a3880,000. Two years later the show's ratings were on the slide, but under the terms of the agreement the BBC was contracted to pay Unique more - \u00a31.1m - for the same volume of output.</p> <p>Money is not everything - relationships also count.

It also invested $5bn (\u00a33.1bn) in AT&amp;T, America's largest telecommunications group, and announced a small-scale partnership with British Telecom.",

Time to take up lettuce growing in the Scilly Isles? Certainly not. Particularly in view of last week's drama when Nick was finally rumbled and made his hasty exit.</p> <p>But apparently we are definitely guilty of manipulation. Here's Paul Watson in this newspaper: \"It was phoney from the start . . . straight away I felt manipulated by others than those I was watching . . . The suspicion that somebody was manipulating them became more obvious. Why did the women go to the door to find the clay penis made by the men?\" Watson is the justly celebrated director of The Fishing Party, Sylvania Waters and The Dinner Party. But when he accuses us of manipulation it feels like being attacked by Richard Branson for publicity-seeking. I think I know what is really bugging Watson and other moaners and groaners from the documentary freemasonry. Big Brother has put all the tricks of their trade on open display. We have Penn-and-Tellered them. Not for us the tongue-loosening wine supplied by the production behind the scenes, the discreet suggestion as to what they should talk about, the results shown as naturally occurring events. Not for us the traffic wardens, customs officers, driving instructors (delete where necessary) resolutely pretending they haven't got cameras pointing up their nostrils. Big Brother is unashamedly upfront. </p> <p>There are the cameras on the wall (now nicknamed by the participants - \"Charlie\" is their favourite). If Big Brother wants them to talk about their first love you will hear it suggested. Call it manipulation if you like but it happens on camera and not behind the tapestry.</p> <p>A Sunday newspaper journalist, hot on our trail, then accuses us of being selective because we televise only half an hour a day and edit out the rest. Yes, Lord Copper, that's how all TV gets made. We offer to show him our rushes - an offer gratefully accepted. But unfortunately this is a scoop open to everyone. He is simply directed to our website where our raw material is, uniquely, available 24 hours a day. I don't recall Watson offering the rushes of The Fishing Party or The Dinner Party for inspection. </p> <p>Now, what about the gross exhibitionism? \"A boring showcase for exhibitionists\" (the Independent). \"They have that manic, 24-hour-auditioning, I'm-up-for-anything-me hysteria\" (AA Gill, the Sunday Times). Guilty as charged. There's certainly a lot of showing off. I remember a particularly mad schoolmaster who accused any boy who wanted to act in the school play of being a ghastly show-off and threatened to beat him. But no show-offs, no school play. And it is not yet a crime to be an extrovert. Any television presenter, actor or bylined journalist has the same egotistical desire to project and be recognised. There's something unedifying about their pulling up the drawbridge after them once they have made it.</p> <p>Big Brother highlights something fundamental about television. People want to be on it for their 15 minutes of fame. This is neither laudable nor reprehensible. It's just a fact. Big Brother, along with docusoaps, game shows and the rest, offers that opportunity. Television creates cohorts of people who are famous for being famous. Not such a terrible thing. You can rail at it but you might as well howl at the moon.</p> <p>That's all very well, our critics say, but this is Peeping Tom television. Organised voyeurism. Er . . . no, I don't think so. The voyeur spies on people without their knowledge. The Big Brother inmates are there voluntarily with the cameras in full view. Anna (you know, the lesbian and former trainee nun) plays Supertramp's It's Raining Again on her guitar. \"It's hard to pretend,\" she sings. Precisely, Anna. You all know you are being watched and you admit it.</p> <p>Finally there's the social experiment thingy: \"What rankles most about the whole seedy exercise is the pretence that it is some sort of genuine social investigation and not just a cynical drive for ratings and profits.\" (Chris Dunkley, the Financial Times). \"Big Brother apparently pretends to be an experiment . . . Only the fluffiest of couch potatoes can have failed to see through its commercialism.\" (Daniel Johnson, the Daily Telegraph). Steady. We were careful to make no such claim. Big Brother is a challenge, a gameshow with a prize winner, a piece of TV entertainment. True, we include psychologists in our Monday edition. But that is because we want them to analyse the behaviour of the competitors for viewers, not because we want them to publish a treatise. As it happens, they may do so - but that is not why we are making the programme. </p> <p>If the academics do go into print I hope they consider how revealing Big Brother has been about 20- and 30-somethings. They never talk about politics, though they are interested in ethics (witness their animated discussion of George Michael's arrest or their even more animated debate about Nick's illegal notes). They are more interested in new age nostrums such as tarot cards and yoga than in traditional religion. They have few hang-ups about nudity and bodily functions and no hang-ups about so-called bad language. Perhaps Channel 4's presentation department could save time by forewarning us only when there are no naughty words in the nightly slot. How strong is \"strong language\" when it is common parlance for this generation?</p> <p>But back to that unkindest cut of all - that this is a commercial exercise, a drive for ratings and profits. Yes, that is precisely what it is. Journalists do not work for free and they quite like to attract readers. We're in business too. I know the British system of television content regulation means that we are frequently expected to claim higher motives in order to earn brownie points. But some television is there to entertain and earn enough to enable more of the same. \"Cynical\" is the only word I would balk at. I prefer \"realist\".</p> <p>Big Brother is pure television. It uses all the industry's production techniques openly; it caters for participants who simply want to be on television; it satisfies viewers' eternal curiosity about the minutiae of others' characters and relationships; and it is wonderfully entertaining (perhaps the medium's most important function). Disappointing, then, that we Brits can take no credit for it whatsoever. It was invented in the Netherlands by producers who come from an entertainment background. They were unconstrained by the petty deceits and intellectual pretensions that are the currency of the UK television industry. That is how they got closer to the core of what television can do than we are likely to. However, don't accuse me of hyperbole on top of everything else. Big Brother is not the greatest thing since sliced bread. But nor it is the end of civilisation as we know it. It's just a revealing and riveting piece of entertainment.</p> <p>The press, of course, has not been unremittingly hostile. Two weeks ago the Daily Telegraph published a leader supporting the programme. That could destroy the street cred of Ruth Wrigley, Conrad Green and the rest of the Big Brother production team forever. Talk about power without responsibility. </p>",

The most highly sought-after comedy-related lig, the annual Paramount Comedy Channel bash, takes place on the Thursday night before the TV festival even starts. But it is an ideal way to limber up for the alcoholic Olympics to come over the weekend. If you fancy being the object of some rapier-tongued abuse from the likes of Mark Lamarr, late nights at the Assembly Rooms bar is the place to be. The Saturday night of TV festival weekend usually also coincides with the Perrier new comedy award winners' party. By Sunday night, the George bar is a place you really don't want to be - the stench of stale booze, fags and egos is overpowering. So why not check out the regular Channel 4-sponsored Sunday night new comedy talent showcase, So You Think You're Funny. If your appetite for free alcohol and uninhibited displays of affection was left unsated by the Saturday night festival do, there may be further opportunities here.</p>",

The most highly sought-after comedy-related lig, the annual Paramount Comedy Channel bash, takes place on the Thursday night before the TV festival even starts. But it is an ideal way to limber up for the alcoholic Olympics to come over the weekend. If you fancy being the object of some rapier-tongued abuse from the likes of Mark Lamarr, late nights at the Assembly Rooms bar is the place to be. The Saturday night of TV festival weekend usually also coincides with the Perrier new comedy award winners' party. By Sunday night, the George bar is a place you really don't want to be - the stench of stale booze, fags and egos is overpowering. So why not check out the regular Channel 4-sponsored Sunday night new comedy talent showcase, So You Think You're Funny. If your appetite for free alcohol and uninhibited displays of affection was left unsated by the Saturday night festival do, there may be further opportunities here.",

And Min had two Tests for England in 1996. Got the connection yet? Yes, it's the well-travelled Patel clan. And the latest edition, Samit Patel, is England's youngest star, their best player in the recent Under-15 World Challenge. He's also just been named the first BBC Test Match Special Under-15 Young Cricketer of the Year. The road from junior cricket to the senior side is never certain.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>FX Toole talks like he writes. Rapidly and saltily. He is 70 years old, is just off the plane and his hearing aid is playing up. But he is unstoppable - on bullfighting, boxing and writing, the Hemingway-esque trinity which has shaped his life and seen a heart-warming late literary flowering. We meet at a gym in east London and, after a couple of hours in his ebullient company, I feel I have gone 10 rounds with a champ, light on his feet but punching heavy, like the prose in Toole's debut book, Rope Burns. </p> <p>Rope Burns is a collection of short stories that draws on Toole's experiences in boxing. James Ellroy has called the book \"a hymn to ferocious longing and loss\" and described it as \"the best boxing short fiction ever written\". It is visceral and violent; written in a rhythmic street language that, in the great American tradition, manages to be both uncompromising and elegiac. It is, on all counts, a pretty good first round for a 70-year-old, worth his 50-year-wait to get published. </p> <p>Where to start with Toole? He seems to encapsulate America. Irish father and \"brought up Irish\" - the FX stands for Francis Xavier; Californian country-girl mother; child of the Depression; brief stint in the navy; trained to be an actor (his brother became an opera singer) but wanted to write too and read avidly. One day he read Hemingway's Death in the Afternoon and had a vision of his future life. </p> <p>\"I was fed up with theatre people. I came upon Death in the Afternoon and said 'here it is, here's the real thing, here's the true drama'. I gave up acting and became a bullfighter, and I got the living shit kicked out of me.\" </p> <p>Toole moved to Mexico and became fluent in Spanish. But he soon realised that it was already too late; though only in his mid-20s, he was too old. \"I was a pretty good bullfighter, but I didn't have the skills to get out of the way. A good writer - it's not only what he puts in, it's what he leaves out, right? with a good fighter, it's not only what he takes to it, it's how he gets away. I had to take chances that someone 16 would not be expected to take.\" He got gored three times, ran out of money, and after two years, headed back to the US- with a new wife and daughter. </p> <p>Maybe age imposes a seamlessness on life, but Toole's struggles have barely made a mark on his spirit. His body is in pretty good shape, too, considering the goring, the boxing, and open-heart surgery 10 years ago. There is clearly something to be said for avoiding publishers' lunches until your 70s. </p> <p>Toole is vague about the 20 years following his return to California. Two more marriages (\"three strikes and now I'm out\"); construction work; lots of bar tending, a good place to hone both survival skills and story-telling instincts; and writing, writing, writing: an \"LSD novel\", a play in which a pair of Doberman pinschers play key roles, but nothing that came even remotely close to being published. </p> <p>Lesser men would have despaired. In fact, it sounds like even Toole despaired. \"I didn't have the heart for it. The reason I didn't have the heart for it is that I didn't have my soul. It took open-heart surgery to give me my soul back; it gave me the heart to put up with rejection.\" In Missouri in 1996, a boxing story, The Monkey Look, \"popped\" into Toole's head. He wrote it, a magazine accepted it, Secker and Warburg editor Geoff Mulligan read it and commissioned Rope Burns, which is being published simultaneously in the UK and US. There has even been Hollywood interest, though Toole already seems to have latched on to the fact that film optioners fight dirtier than ageing heavyweights. </p> <p>Though Toole has always loved boxing, he came late to the professional game. \"I was 45, living in California; I'm watching the fights every week and all of a sudden the skies part and I think I'm going to learn how to do this. I had no illusions about being a fighter; I wanted to understand how they did it, mechanically, psychically and mentally. That was the great adventure.\" </p> <p>He found a trainer called Dub Huntley, who was so sure that Toole would give up he trained him for nothing. Toole didn't go away. He was way too old to fight, but not too old to work as a cornerman. Huntley was tied up one evening and asked Toole to work the corner for one of his fighters in an amateur contest in LA. Toole reluctantly agreed and it was love at first fight. \"I fell in love right there, from the inside out. It was from the outside in before; now it's the inside out.\" </p> <p>He became a fight junkie. \"There's nothing like it in the world. It's like bullfighting: you're living right on the edge. I'll fly anywhere. Where's the fight? I'll go.\" He became an expert in treating cuts and travelled all over the US, and to Europe and South Africa, working corners. </p> <p>In the introduction to Rope Burns, Toole reflects on this love affair: \"I began to learn and to understand what had drawn me to boxing as a boy. It was the science of fighting, and the heart it takes to be a fighter. Boxing was an exercise of the mind. I also began to realise that, despite my age, I was someone who could play the game. I was spellbound. I still am. God has blessed me with the sweet science.\" </p> <p>Rope Burns depicts the brutality and crookedness of fighting, the viciousness of LA street life, the desperate circumstances of many boxers. Toole wants to distance himself from writers such as Norman Mailer, who, Toole says, have written about boxing from the outside and in the process romanticised it. </p> <p>\"What happens so often is, 'look at me, look how much I know about boxing', as opposed to 'what's the subject that we're dealing with?' I have this tremendous insight into this hermetically sealed world, which they don't; they don't know their ass. Mailer trained and for a while he was trying to get into fights with people. The writer as tough guy. Fuck that. You fight for money or you fight because someone comes through the window of your house. Some writer comes up and says 'let's go fight'; get lost.\" </p> <p>But for all the desperation, the fact that Toole portrays a Fat City-style world of bruisers and losers, there is a kind of innocent beauty in the book too: the love of the trainer for his charge; the common search for identity, for - key word in boxing - respect; the way two men who have brutalised each other will hug at the end; the realisation that the higher you go, the further you can fall. </p> <p>Toole mentions, in passing, a fighter called Frankie \"Too Sweet\" Jennings, a handsome man in his youth (hence Too Sweet), now so busted up he can hardly make himself understood. A good argument against boxing, I suggest. Toole doesn't get the full freight of the question. Jennings was talented, he says, but he didn't train properly, was out of condition, got hit too often. Now you just want to hug him, hold him. </p> <p>But boxing wrecks lives, I say loudly, to make sure the hearing aid is working, and he gets the counter-punch. He throws a combination. \"There is more barbarity in corporate America than there is in boxing. More lives are destroyed in business than in boxing. They kill more jockeys in America than fighters. The physical part of boxing is incidental to the mental part. I hope I've portrayed that in the book. You have to be tough to be a boxer, but it's not about being tough, it's about being smart. In bullfighting, one of the worst things they can say to a young bullfighter is 'you're brave, you've got balls'. Bullfighters want to be artists. The greatest of all was Pedro Romero. He was in 7,000 bullfights and he never shed a drop of blood. That's a good bullfighter.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Rope Burns is published tomorrow by Secker and Warburg (\u00a310)</p>",

      "body": "<p>The Spanish poet Jos\u00e9 Angel Valente, who has died aged 71, wrote at two removes from the harsh realities of his homeland; firstly, by living in exile during the Franco era, and secondly by contemplating being and the nature of poetry itself rather than more obvious political themes.</p> <p>Born in Orense, an \"obscure\" town in Galicia, Valente claimed that his biography lay in his poetry, but aspects of his external life aid understanding of his work. The civil war and Franco's dictatorship marked him, especially when his Falangist father fell foul of the regime. There are no yearnings for a return to that childhood in his poems - although he wrote C\u00e1ntigas de al\u00e9n (Songs of long ago, 1989) in Galician.</p> <p>He went on to study law in Santiago de Compostela, and graduated in romance philology at the University of Madrid in 1953, with a prize. From 1955-58 he taught and earned an MA at Oxford; from 1958-75, he translated for the World Health Organisation in Geneva, before moving to Paris, where he worked from 1975-86 for Unesco.</p> <p>After that, he lived between Geneva and Almer\u00eda, with its desert landscapes and the nearby Cabo de Gata national park. His life's work as a poet in self-exile was finally recognised in Spain when he won the prestigious Pr\u00edncipe de Asturias prize in 1988, and then the National Poetry prize in 1993. None of his books has yet been translated into English. Many of those who grew up under Franco became politicised poets, but Valente turned to writing meta-poetry about the inner processes of poetry itself because he was a \"poet in times of misery\" who had to re-think what poetry meant in the corruption of language under Franco.</p> <p>The practice of writing and translating poetry became his self-defence, and path to the enigma of inner knowledge. Franco's shadow drove him into \"poverty and exile\", living in what he called the \"extrapatria\", outside Spain.</p> <p>He published the first of more than 20 books, A modo de esperanza (In hopeful mode, 1955), after winning the Adonais poetry prize; his second book, Poemas a L\u00e1zaro (Poems to Lazarus, 1960), won the Premio de la Critica, and in 1980 he won the prize for the second time with Tres lecciones de tinieblas (Three lessons of Tenebrae).</p> <p>Last year his complete poems, Obra po\u00e9tica, appeared in two volumes. Apart from his poetry, Valente translated and collected his short, acute essays on Spanish mystics and others. He enjoyed collaborating on books with painters such as Eduardo Chillida (a fellow Galician), Antoni T\u00e0pies and Antonio Saura.</p> <p>Over the years, rather than any sudden shifts, there was a pruning of the non-essential, edging towards meditative fragments. His later work requires concentration, is religious in its seeking of a poetic sacred - or better, its continuous absence. Valente emphasises \"not understanding\", a relentless verbal deconditioning, a focusing on \"attentiveness\". This is summarised in a brief 1989 poem: To rub oneself out. / Only in the absence of any sign / does the god land .</p> <p>Valente never courted popularity, wrote outside Hispanic fashions and in-groups, but was considered by writers like Juan Goytisolo to be Spain's most dedicated poet; a poet's poet elaborating an austere ethic of creativity. He exemplified poetic integrity, pushing poetry into terrains that compete with religious, mystical and Heideggerian notions of inner being. His poetry picks up the challenge of the great, acerbic 17th-century writer Francisco de Quevedo; it expands Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez's \"pure poetry\" and Antonio Machado's philosophical colloquialism, and integrates the self-denying, laconic Peruvian, C\u00e9sar Vallejo.</p> <p>From these he learned self-belittlement, direct references and rhythms, and an aesthetics of verbal poverty in the form of a critique of superfluous words, similes and metaphors. His work is contemplative, emanating from the darkness of the solitary self, without ever pandering to the sensual baroque of the Spanish poetic tradition embodied by Lorca and Neruda.</p> <p>In his introspective poetry there are no easy answers, for he denies the possibility of understanding anything. Key terms such as \"to be unaware\", \"emptiness\", \"silence\" and \"loneliness\" convey his constant self-examination; poets are \"divers into emptiness\". In the poem Obituary, we read: In the centre of his heart, the burial mound which he himself had raised with the years remained shut forever .</p> <p>A poem of 1970 could be an epitaph: He performed three exercises / to dissolve his ego, / and on the fourth found himself alone / with his eyes fixed on an answer / that nobody could give him .</p> <p>Many poems explore this inner vacuum, and the lack of references outside the poem itself makes all his work, not anecdotally autobiographical, but the biography of a mind.</p> <p>Valente was twice married, with four children, two of whom predeceased him.</p> <p>Jos\u00e9 Angel Valente, poet, born April 25 1929; died July 18 2000</p>",

Last month, a US television network announced that it was going to start using new technology to advertise itself in men's public lavatories and unveiled their campaign. \"My God, look at the size of that!\" a voice announces as you step up in front of the urinal. \"Hey watch your shoes!\" Another version announces: \"You're a mover and a shaker.\" The commercials, which have been placed in hundreds of public lavatories in Los Angeles and New York, are to advertise a new show by comedian Norm Macdonald, and it is Macdonald's voice that addresses the visitor. A visual message that tells of \"another fine use of the colour yellow\" accompanies the ads. The technique, using CD-Roms, was hailed by Variety as \"must-pee TV\" and praised by an ABC executive as mirroring the \"sophistication and attitude\" that people associate with the network station. This might have seemed like a one-off, but then during last month's Democratic convention in Los Angeles, the urinal again became a place for the advertiser. The place was the gents in the Patriotic Hall where the shadow convention - which dealt with all the issues ignored by the main convention - was held. This time the message was political and was placed in the bowl of the urinal. Don't ask how it got there or how much the poor soul who placed it there was paid. It instructed users to ensure that their aim was better than that of Star Wars, the US nuclear defence system that spectacularly failed to hit its dummy target last month. The message was that the $100 million spent on the Star Wars test was a waste of money. Clearly there is now no escape. It used to be the case that all you had to worry about in a public toilet was an undercover police officer, but now that advertisers have been allowed in there will be no stopping them.

Boy, did we have it tough.\" </p> <p>A-level results are higher because students and teachers are doing better. Mightn't it be more appropriate to give some credit where it is due, instead of undermining the achievement of all involved? More athletes can run the four-minute mile, but we don't say: \"Yes, well miles are much shorter than they used to be.\" I never got a grade A in any exam I ever took, I even managed an \"unclassified\" in my metalwork O-level. What Chris Woodhead is saying is that we need more results like this. So English students should be encouraged to describe the poetry of Shakespeare based on their readings of Brodies' Notes. History students should revise half of the syllabus, so they have to begin A-level essays by saying: \"When examining the reasons for the Repeal of the Corn Laws it is interesting to look at the causes of the American revolution.\" </p> <p>The alternative of making A-levels harder would be grossly unfair on anyone who ended up failing an exam which they would have passed a few years earlier. They would compete for the same jobs as slightly older candidates who were no brighter but seemed to have better qualifications.

To get my maths O-level for example, I spent two years grappling with the most impossible mathematical problem of all time: \"What is the point of slide rules? Logarithms, quadratic equations, matrices?\" I eventually understood all of them, but while a cheap pocket calculator was burning a hole in my pocket, I failed to solve the impossible mathematical conundrum of \"Slide rules: why?\" </p> <p>And so now, instead of teaching our children about oxbow lakes and the Whig hegemony, we should be teaching them stuff they can use when they get to our age. How to get peppercorns into the pepper grinder, for example. A-level eating spaghetti in a white shirt. GCSE Staying Awake during Nationwide Football League Review. How to say \"No thank you\" to squeegee merchants in a way that they will take any notice. How to open a door for someone which opens away from you. There are hundreds of skills that most of us still haven't mastered. </p> <p>And just as our education should better prepare us for adulthood, so the Ofsted regime of regular inspection should be extended to our life after school. When Trevor Macdonald reads out the evening news, there should be someone sitting behind him, tutting slightly and making notes whenever he mispronounces Slobodan Milosevic. When air stewardesses have finished giving the safety instructions before take off, they should be told that they were failing to engage the passengers in an exciting and challenging way. Even Chris Woodhead should not be immune.

I'm not sure about the 70s themselves, though: sometimes they seem like another planet. The decade certainly seems alien in the current crop of TV shows, such as BBC2's I Love the 70s, in which talking heads tenderly recall our past passions. Can it be that we really sat glued to Starsky and Hutch, wore lip gloss, bought Brotherhood of Man records? Or rather, did we really enjoy these things for real, without ironic hindsight? </p> <p>The true cause of our nostalgia is that we perceive the 70s as the last period in Britain when it was possible to enjoy popular culture at first hand - that is, without mediating layers of commentary. This was a last breather before the advent of the sort of style journalism that dissected and ironised pop culture. </p> <p>Sometimes, however, the past seems less like another country than just two doors down the street - which is what makes Channel 5's That 70s Show so perplexing. Created by Terry and Bonnie Turner, originators of Third Rock From the Sun, this retro sitcom keeps telling us that things are happening in another world. Yet everything looks familiar. Squint a little, and Eric and his teen buddies from Point Place, Wisconsin, could be modern high-schoolers. </p> <p>The real anachronistic skewiness is left to the parents. Girl-next-door Donna's parents are period pieces: a Danny De Vito clone in a frizzy perm and a bona fide ex-Charlie's Angel (Tanya Roberts). But Eric's folks embody a stranger time slip: Dad is a stuffy authoritarian, Mom is protective and fussy, at one point suffering a paranoid vision of the kids going wild when left alone in the house (dressing as blaxploitation pimps and failing to use table mats). Otherwise, they seem like 70s parents only in the sense that they are really a hangover from stuffy 50s sitcom parents. And that is the joke - they are an anachronism within an anachronism, straight out of Happy Days. </p> <p>Happy Days was a 70s phenomenon par excellence, in that nostalgia was a central obsession of the era. Just as we reinvent the 70s, that decade re-created other eras after its own image. To get its period right, That 70s Show would have to refer to 50s revivalist rocker bands like Sha-Na-Na; Eric's gang would have to adulate the Fonz, or decorate their rooms with 20s retro mirrors. </p> <p>That 70s Show is not particularly funny, but the creakiness is part of the joke. If the show mostly feels like a stiff, run-of-the-mill sitcom, that is actually an ironic play on the sitcoms that its characters would have watched. </p> <p>There's a huge difference between That 70s Show and those British 70s shows. In our own retro programmes, the past looks absolutely other, a tawdry world of brightly coloured nostalgic kitsch - Clangers dolls, CB radio, Sex Pistols singles. But That 70s Show suggests a strangely familiar America. That is because the programme's allusions are not really to the 70s at all, but to late-90s reflections of the 70s. The show draws on ideas and images in the air today - the retro repertoire of films such as The Ice Storm, Dazed and Confused, The Brady Bunch Movie. That 70s Show is not much cop as a spoof of the 70s, but as a pastiche of our turn-of-the-century fantasies of the age, it's at least remarkably thorough. Still, I doubt I'll be reminiscing fondly about it in 20 years' time. </p> <p>\u0095 That 70s Show is on Channel 5 on Mondays at 7pm.</p>",

That 70s Show is not particularly funny, but the creakiness is part of the joke. If the show mostly feels like a stiff, run-of-the-mill sitcom, that is actually an ironic play on the sitcoms that its characters would have watched. There's a huge difference between That 70s Show and those British 70s shows. In our own retro programmes, the past looks absolutely other, a tawdry world of brightly coloured nostalgic kitsch - Clangers dolls, CB radio, Sex Pistols singles. But That 70s Show suggests a strangely familiar America. That is because the programme's allusions are not really to the 70s at all, but to late-90s reflections of the 70s. The show draws on ideas and images in the air today - the retro repertoire of films such as The Ice Storm, Dazed and Confused, The Brady Bunch Movie. That 70s Show is not much cop as a spoof of the 70s, but as a pastiche of our turn-of-the-century fantasies of the age, it's at least remarkably thorough. Still, I doubt I'll be reminiscing fondly about it in 20 years' time. \u0095 That 70s Show is on Channel 5 on Mondays at 7pm.",

Profits before tax and goodwill rose 23% to \u00a347.4m in the six months to June 30, exceeding analysts' forecasts of up to \u00a346.2m. But its share price slumped 17% as analysts questioned the company's decision to include surpluses from a pension fund in its operating profit figures. The row centred on the inclusion of a \u00a314.3m refund from its Swedish pension fund as a non-exceptional item. Several analysts said they believed the refund should have been treated as an exceptional item and they claimed it distorted the operating profit. The company has seen its shares gain 86% since May 23, that trend being boosted last week on the back of rival software company CMG's report of higher than expected demand for software system integration services from wireless phone companies. Sema executives said the company beat analysts' forecasts despite the refund, because the money was offset by exceptional costs - redundancies and early retirement for people in Sweden - and the extra costs incurred in France because of the 35-hour working week.

BT won a UMTS licence in the recent government auction. </p> <p>BT Cellnet has consistently underperformed its chief rival, Vodafone, but analysts have taken some comfort in a recent improvement in revenues. Sir Peter Bonfield, BT chief executive, recently set the onerous target of doubling profitability by the end of this year. </p> <p>BT's increasing debt burden has heightened speculation that various parts of the business will be floated off to raise cash as well as realising value for shareholders. </p> <p>BT has already announced plans to float part of its directory service business, Yell, later this year. </p> <p>The company's board is expected to announce a timetable by January for the partial sale of other subsidiaries including OpenWorld and Concert, its joint venture with AT&amp;T.</p>",

      "bodyText": "BT Cellnet, the second largest mobile phone network in Britain, yesterday named a former regional boss at the cellular business of US telecoms group Sprint as managing director. David McGlade joins the company at the beginning of next month. He could find himself leading the flotation of the business to appease increasingly frustrated shareholders in parent company British Telecom. He will fill the gap left by Peter Erskine who was recently given overall responsibility for BT's mobile assets worldwide. Mr McGlade, 39, is understood to have been favoured for his experience in the development of wireless internet services. Following his time at Sprint Mr McGlade was chief executive and co-founder of Pure Matrix, a Colorado-based software company providing platforms for mobile internet services. He has also worked for a company involved in interactive television, experience which should be useful for the development of next-generation services. BT won a UMTS licence in the recent government auction. BT Cellnet has consistently underperformed its chief rival, Vodafone, but analysts have taken some comfort in a recent improvement in revenues. Sir Peter Bonfield, BT chief executive, recently set the onerous target of doubling profitability by the end of this year. BT's increasing debt burden has heightened speculation that various parts of the business will be floated off to raise cash as well as realising value for shareholders. BT has already announced plans to float part of its directory service business, Yell, later this year. The company's board is expected to announce a timetable by January for the partial sale of other subsidiaries including OpenWorld and Concert, its joint venture with AT&amp;T.",

      "body": "<p>On a day when TMT - telecom, media and technology - stocks were struck down by a nasty bout of profit-taking, the performance of <strong> Vodafone</strong> raised a few eyebrows. </p> <p>Shares in London's biggest stock climbed 7p, or 2.46%, to 292p on heavy turnover of 230m as analysts reported back in upbeat mood after a meeting with the company. </p> <p>Deutsche Bank and SG Securities restated their \"strong buy\" ratings, while CSFB and Dresdner Kleinwort Benson advised clients to \"buy\". </p> <p>According to dealers, the bottom line of Monday's briefing was that, despite spending billions on next-generation mobile phone licences, Vodafone could have very low levels of net debt by the end of the year. Some were even predicting that it might have no debt if the disposal of Infostrada, its Italian fixed-line telecom business, is made in conjunction with the initial public offerings of its German equivalent, Arcor. </p> <p>While definite plans for an IPO of Arcor are some way off, dealers expect news on Infostrada in the next few weeks. </p> <p>Leading shares, meanwhile, ended lower for the first time in seven sessions, as investors decided it was time to book profits in the TMT stocks after last week's phenomenal run. </p> <p>Led by a sell-off in the IT software sector, the FTSE 100 index ended 45.6 points lower at 6,752.5. All the other main indices were in negative territory, with the TechMark 100 down 184.03 points at 4,102.97. </p> <p>\"Everything in the TMT world has had such a massive run-up in the last week and we have been waiting for this to happen,\" said one dealer. </p> <p>Among the blue chips, Anglo-French software group <strong> Sema</strong> was the worst performer, falling 229p to \u00a311.21 after posting a disappointing set of interim results. </p> <p>At first glance the figures seemed impressive enough. But after analysts stripped out a \u00a314.3m contribution from a Swedish pension fund refund doubts started to creep in, with some suggesting the com pany had suffered a decline in operating profits. </p> <p>While Sema said it was unfair to strip out the pension refund, analysts were not prepared to give the company the benefit of the doubt. Dresdner Kleinwort Benson cut its rating to \"reduce\" from \"buy\" and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter shifted its stance to \"outperform\" from \"strong buy\". </p> <p>With Sema's figures out in the open, scrutiny turned to rival software company <strong> Logica</strong>, which reports full-year figures today. Its shares closed 205p weaker at \u00a321.75. </p> <p>Other big TMT losers included <strong> Misys</strong>, down 40p to 745p, <strong> Sage</strong>, off 28p at 650p, <strong> Colt Telecom</strong>, 178p lower at \u00a322.80, and <strong> WPP</strong>, 37p weaker at 975p. </p> <p>Anglo-Dutch software group <strong> CMG</strong> shed 34p to \u00a313.83p, unsettled by talk of directors' share selling.

      "bodyText": "On a day when TMT - telecom, media and technology - stocks were struck down by a nasty bout of profit-taking, the performance of Vodafone raised a few eyebrows. Shares in London's biggest stock climbed 7p, or 2.46%, to 292p on heavy turnover of 230m as analysts reported back in upbeat mood after a meeting with the company. Deutsche Bank and SG Securities restated their \"strong buy\" ratings, while CSFB and Dresdner Kleinwort Benson advised clients to \"buy\". According to dealers, the bottom line of Monday's briefing was that, despite spending billions on next-generation mobile phone licences, Vodafone could have very low levels of net debt by the end of the year. Some were even predicting that it might have no debt if the disposal of Infostrada, its Italian fixed-line telecom business, is made in conjunction with the initial public offerings of its German equivalent, Arcor. While definite plans for an IPO of Arcor are some way off, dealers expect news on Infostrada in the next few weeks. Leading shares, meanwhile, ended lower for the first time in seven sessions, as investors decided it was time to book profits in the TMT stocks after last week's phenomenal run. Led by a sell-off in the IT software sector, the FTSE 100 index ended 45.6 points lower at 6,752.5. All the other main indices were in negative territory, with the TechMark 100 down 184.03 points at 4,102.97. \"Everything in the TMT world has had such a massive run-up in the last week and we have been waiting for this to happen,\" said one dealer. Among the blue chips, Anglo-French software group Sema was the worst performer, falling 229p to \u00a311.21 after posting a disappointing set of interim results. At first glance the figures seemed impressive enough. But after analysts stripped out a \u00a314.3m contribution from a Swedish pension fund refund doubts started to creep in, with some suggesting the com pany had suffered a decline in operating profits. While Sema said it was unfair to strip out the pension refund, analysts were not prepared to give the company the benefit of the doubt. Dresdner Kleinwort Benson cut its rating to \"reduce\" from \"buy\" and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter shifted its stance to \"outperform\" from \"strong buy\". With Sema's figures out in the open, scrutiny turned to rival software company Logica, which reports full-year figures today. Its shares closed 205p weaker at \u00a321.75. Other big TMT losers included Misys, down 40p to 745p, Sage, off 28p at 650p, Colt Telecom, 178p lower at \u00a322.80, and WPP, 37p weaker at 975p. Anglo-Dutch software group CMG shed 34p to \u00a313.83p, unsettled by talk of directors' share selling. A statement from the company released after the market closed revealed that chairman Cor Stutterheim had sold 200,000 shares, chief executive Tom Rusting 100,000 and deputy chairman Clay Brendish 744,000 at \u00a313.70p each. It was also revealed that trusts connected with Mr Brendish had sold 2.5m shares. Blue Circle managed to buck the trend, advancing 22p to 423p on news of a deal which might save it $200m a year on fuel costs. Royal Bank of Scotland rose 31p to \u00a313.14 after Merrill Lynch issued a weighty \"buy\" note. Merrill reckons the stock is undervalued relative to its British and European peers and has set a \u00a316.50 target price. Outside the leading index, engineer BBA slipped 51p to 427p after its chief executive quit, while media group Aegis added 7p to 203p, aided by talk that next week's first-half results will beat expectations. In the smaller company universe, automotive parts group Bostrom surged 35.5p to 222p after agreeing a \u00a338.5m cash offer from rival CVS but leisure management group Kunick tumbled 5.5p to 23p after warning on profits.",

      "bodyText": "The complicated and emotive issue of whether an operation to separate Siamese twins Jodie and Mary would amount to the unlawful killing of the weaker sister was raised in the appeal court yesterday. Several times during the hearing one of the three judges, Lord Justice Brooke, held up a photograph of the babies and asked how the operation could be carried out without an \"invasion\" of Mary's body. The parents of the girls are appealing against a high court ruling that the operation should go ahead even though it will lead to the death of Mary, who relies on her sister for blood and oxygen. On Monday the judges ordered that a second opinion be sought on the conclusions of the doctors at St Mary's hospital in Manchester, where the children are being cared for. Yesterday a surgeon and paediatric cardiologist from Great Ormond Street hospital were examining the twins. Jodie and Mary - false names to protect their identity - were born at St Mary's on August 8, joined at the lower abdomen and sharing one working heart and set of lungs.

Sorry about the FTSE 100 price index graphic for August on page 26 yesterday which repeated the figure 6300 all the way up its vertical axis. Its base figure was correct at 6300 rising at intervals of 100 to 6700. The new Humanities Research Board, referred to on page 11, Education, yesterday, is the Arts and Humanities Research Board. Political homophone, from page 3, yesterday, where we said, \"Ms Mowlam, 51 later this month, denied her health played any part in the decision to quit and maintained she had recovered from the brain tumour... The whig has gone...\" [corrected in late editions]. It is the policy of the Guardian to correct significant errors as soon as possible. Please quote the date and page number.

The National Union of Teachers published research revealing the increasingly desperate measures that heads of schools in England and Wales were being forced to take to ensure that children starting the academic year this week have a teacher. They include using unqualified and untrained teachers including technicians, appointing staff without even interviewing them, using overseas staff from Australia, New Zealand and Canada, modifying the curriculum to fit the staff available, and raising class and group sizes to unacceptable levels. The research was carried out for the NUT by Alan Smithers and Pamela Robinson of the department of education of Liverpool University. Their researchers talked at length to 50 primary heads and 57 secondary heads, as well as 21 independent school heads, who revealed the extent of their problems anonymously. One headteacher said: \"When push comes to shove you've got to put a body in front of the class.

Professor Smithers and Dr Robinson carried out a parallel study, which was designed to explain why when there have been continuing shortfalls in recruitment to teacher training, government figures show that the schools are apparently fully staffed. \"The survey found that about 10% of all posts in the schools questioned fell vacant, and of those 4% [0.4% of all posts] remain unfilled\", Prof Smithers said.

      "bodyText": "With its romantic heather-covered moors, rolling hills and smugglers' inns, Exmoor has long been a haven for Lorna Doone devotees. The lush Devon landscape draws thousands of fans of the 19th century novel, keen to relive the moment Lorna is felled by a bandit's bullet at the altar. But the popularity of the area has proved its downfall in the eyes of the BBC. Drama executives making a Christmas special featuring Lorna's love affair with sweetheart John Ridd have spurned the novel's setting in favour of the Brecon Beacons in Wales. They blamed the huge number of tourists on the moors, fearing the film set would be disrupted by ramblers or a speeding Mondeo. Exmoor villagers say the tourism industry, which relies heavily on the Lorna Doone connection for income, will suffer as tourists switch to Wales. Farmers say the decision made a mockery of government calls for them to move into more lucrative areas such as tourism and holiday lettings. George Layton of the tourist office in Lynton, the heart of \"Doone Valley\", said the county was shocked by the snub, the second in five years. \"We had McDoone a few years ago when it was filmed in Scotland and now we have got Welsh Doone,\" he said. \"People will go to Brecon after the film is shown and they will ask, 'Where are all the places in the story such as the Waterslide where Lorna and John fell in love?'

      "body": "<p>Jill Selbourne, who has died aged 54 after a spirited resistance to cancer, was a Labour councillor in Conservative Westminster and one of the leaders of the campaign against gerrymandering there. A radical campaigner among London's poor and underprivileged over several decades, she had represented the impoverished Harrow Road ward since 1986.</p> <p>Selbourne was an inspirational woman of great charm and humour and a tenacious and imaginative political fighter along the difficult urban frontiers of race and class. She had a capacity for creating friendships and getting people together socially as well as politically.</p> <p>Like so many people in the Labour Party, she could be categorised neither as \"Old Labour\" nor as \"New Labour\": she perceived herself simply as a socialist, an anti-racist, an internationalist and someone who thought for herself. Her politics was rooted in community activism, working with black and refugee groups in the north of the borough, and helping to galvanise local communities.</p> <p>Further afield, a visit to the Caribbean island of Dominica, where many of north Paddington's inhabitants come from, left her with a permanent enthusiasm for its way of life. She would often return there, and helped to set up the Frontline Cooperative Bookshop in Roseau, the capital, in 1982, the island's first - and still surviving - independent bookshop.</p> <p>Selbourne was born in Devon but her family later farmed along the Ridgeway on the Wiltshire Downs, where she spent much of her childhood and frequently returned to recharge her batteries in later life. She was educated in Norfolk and in Somerset, and joined the sixth form of Marlborough grammar school before graduating with a first in anthropology from Sussex University.</p> <p>Travelling in India inspired an interest in the sub-continent's religions, a commitment to the politics of the wider world and a zeal to effect change, both in Britain and abroad. On her return, she completed her formal education by studying for an MA at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, and then in 1969 began working with the Community Development Project in Southwark.</p> <p>Moving to north Paddington in 1973, she worked as a community development officer with Voluntary Action Westminster, finding in community regeneration and the empowerment of deprived and dispossessed people her own reason for existence. She relished the area's multi-racial, multi-cultural life, and for many years at the Notting Hill carnival would appear in carnival costume during the day and then dance furiously behind the floats until closing time.</p> <p>For many years her spare time was spent working with YaaAsantewa, the black arts centre off the Harrow Road named after the great Ashanti queen. Started in 1973, and originally known as the Factory, it occupied former industrial premises which Jill campaigned to acquire for use as a community centre. She was its indefatigable supporter through several crises.</p> <p>As a councillor in 1986 and chairwoman of the Labour group on the Westminster council housing committee, she was the prime mover, successfully opposing plans to sell off the council's housing estates. Helping to channel the creative energies of the people involved, she was instrumental in starting the resident-controlled Walterton and Elgin Community Homes housing association, which assumed responsibility for some of the old estates.</p> <p>More recently, as developers made plans for the gigantic site once occupied by Paddington station's goods yards, Selbourne took a lead in organising the local community to demand a say in what would happen there. The result was the creation of the Paddington Development Trust, which involves schools and colleges, health trusts and residents' associations and secured a \u00a313m government grant, the largest new funding ever brought into one of central London's most deprived areas.</p> <p>Late in 1998, at the height of her powers and with many ambitions still unfulfilled, Selbourne was diagnosed with malignant melanoma, and she resisted it with characteristic determination. Eventually, when it became clear that this was one battle she would not win, she accepted her fate without fear and drew great strength from her many friends and family, and from her own deep spiritual reserves.</p> <p>She leaves two daughters, Jane and Sally, and two granddaughters, and her long-time partner, Neale Coleman, whom she married two weeks before her death.</p> <p>Jill Selbourne, political campaigner, born February 25 1946; died August 31 2000</p>",

They don't realise how their stunted lexicon of empty phrases no longer conveys anything more than its own aridity. William Hague's speech yesterday launching his piffling potpourri of policies was typical of the species - but Labour politicians can and do seize every chance to talk much the same vapid nonsense from any podium to any captive audience.</p> <p>Maybe they all have some special key on their computers that spews it out, like Hague yesterday: \"We want a Britain where communities thrive and public services serve... We are not just interested in a healthy and strong economy but also in a healthy and strong society too... We will ensure that Britain is one of the most admired and influential countries in the world... We want a Britain the people of Britain are themselves crying out for... an ambitious, self-confident, prosperous, decent...\" Blah, blah, blah. All anyone wants is for politicians to stop talking at them like idiots.</p> <p>When people say to despairing canvassers that they don't vote because \"they're all the same\", they are partly right. Most politicians do talk the same brand of high-flown tosh. The very few who don't are loved, regardless of politics - the rare Mo Mowlam or Ken Clarke. Minds numbed by such dross turn instead to the more serious questions of whether or not they prefer the way Tony Blair says \"Y'know\" or Hague's shiny pink baldness.</p> <p>As a result only the trained ear (one paid not to fall asleep) deconstructs the crucial policy differences hidden within these forests of verbiage. It's only the misleading blather that makes them sound the same, for at this election the great left-right divide will be as deep and wide as the Atlantic ocean.</p> <p>Believing in Britain is a flimsy thing printed on flimsy paper, an interim stop-gap while the Conservatives struggle behind the scenes to work out their true tax-and-spend policies. With no costings it's all fantasy policy-making. So we get odd things thrown in - a minimum speed limit on motorways (no, that's not a misprint); \"Get rid of the worst towerblocks and large estates\" (just like that); give religious broadcasters national licenses (hello, Pat Robertson); a full day's work for every prisoner in self-financing prison workshops, (every prison governor's dream, but forget \"self-financing\"); and privatise universities so they can all be like the Ivy League. All this smacks of desperation from worried young policy-wonks told to come up with something, anything new and eye-catching - never mind if it works, is being done anyway or will cost a fortune once costed.</p> <p>At the heart of its most important policies lies one consistent strand - America and George W Bush. They've all been over there for fact-finding summer holidays, including Two Brains David Willetts, and they've come home star-struck by Republican ideas, policies and even the language. Tax cuts lie at the heart of the strategy - though Hague's \u00a316bn cut looks a little weak beside George W Bush's stonking great $1.3 trillion. (No, it may not be \u00a316bn when they've done their sums, Portillo says, though that is what they'd have to cut by 2003 to meet their pledge of cutting taxes while not spending above a 1.3% lower estimate of trend growth.)</p> <p>Britain Works, copying America Works, will replace the New Deal with a \"can work must work\" guarantee. As in the US, the unemployed will be handed over to private companies to find them jobs, making profits out of any social security saving. Conservatives say it will save 25% by cutting out expensive training, illiteracy and drug treatment programmes that currently succeed in getting many of the unemployable back on their feet. A new plan to force lone parents to work is purely American: promised savings of \u00a33bn on social security include an extraordinary projection that every single lone mother on income support will get a job in year one. And, of course, US-style private health \"will be encouraged to grow\".</p> <p>A new privatised pensions policy is also borrowed from the George W Bush campaign. It's a good example of how far the Conservatives' ideology has blown a hole in their costings. They will let young people opt out of the state pension. Instead of paying into national insurance each week, they can pay into a private pension fund of their own. But there is no notional sum each person pays towards his or her own old age pension. All the money paid in now goes to pay today's pensioners. If large numbers stop paying in, a huge hole opens up in national insurance.</p> <p>So what will they cut to fill that gap? Willetts pretends that by fiddling public accounting systems he can claim to be saving a future government in 40 years time. But that just won't wash: from the look in his eye, he knows it too.</p> <p>How will all this sound to the voters? Odd, alien and very American. Tory voters, especially older ones, are not particularly enamoured of American rightwing ideology. Margaret Thatcher and her advisers flirted with the US right, but she was canny enough to know it wouldn't play back here. Her brand of rightwingery was very English, but Hague doesn't have Thatcher's ear for the timbre of English conservatism. Anything that smacks of privatising universities, health and pensions will do him no good. It may excite his coterie but it will alarm his own blue-rinses almost as much as those crucial Middle Englanders.</p> <p>Why the infatuation with America? Because it isn't Europe. Here lies the one coherent and resonant thread that runs right through this document, its only true theme: no to Europe, now and for ever. So Hague will take \"reserved powers\" to stop further EU intrusion, push for an alliance with Nafta and support the US national missile defence system, trying to tilt us westwards.</p> <p>In 10 years, he thundered yesterday, \"our country that so many of our countrymen lived for and sweated for and died for, could have disappeared\". On one side the Atlantic is \"freedom\" (as in freedom to dine at Marco Pierre White's), while on the other is the hidebound socialist old Europe of welfare states. The Conservatives will ensure that the ideology of Europe versus America runs right down the electoral fault line, reaching into every crevice of social policy. Despite the odd maverick in each party, left versus right and Europe versus America is what this election will be all about.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",

In a speech to the European parliament in Strasbourg, Ahmed Qureia said the Palestinians would support internationalising all of Jerusalem - including Arab East Jerusalem, occupied illegally by Israel since 1967 - should the two sides fail to reach a final settlement in the crucial weeks ahead. \"Unless we can reach an agreement on Jerusalem, I have to declare that both parts of Jerusalem east and west should be a unified international Jerusalem ... not just the capital of Israel or Palestine, but a capital of the world,\" said Mr Qureia, who is speaker of the Palestinian parliament. The proposal revives a formula put forward by the UN in 1947 and since repeatedly rejected by Israel, and opposed by the Palestinians, though it still remains part of European foreign policy. President Clinton is to begin talks today with Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, and Mr Arafat, meeting each separately on the sidelines of the millennium summit in New York. The meetings at the Waldorf Astoria have caused some to hope that during the hubbub of the three-day summit of 150 world leaders, Mr Clinton will somehow produce the miracle that eluded him in two weeks of concentrated negotiations at Camp David last July. Mr Clinton has likened the experience of those talks to having teeth extracted without painkillers, and strongly criticised Mr Arafat for his unwillingness to match Israeli compromises on Jerusalem. Some Palestinians hope that yesterday's proposal from such a senior figure as Mr Qureia, popularly known as Abu Ala and seen as a possible successor to the ailing Mr Arafat - could relieve some of the pressure on the Palestinian leader during his New York talks. \"He said it to try to throw forward an idea that would be acceptable among Europeans and internationally,\" said Nabil Khatib, director of the media centre of Bir Zeit University in the West Bank town of Ramallah. \"The Palestinians have a feeling that Israel is trying to give the impression that they [the Israelis] are the only ones who are making concessions.

Instead, they are trying to press Mr Arafat to accept a dispensation for Jerusalem, offered since Camp David, that would dodge the question of ownership over the sanctified ground in the old walled city by declaring God the sovereign of holy places.

They want to see some sort of force to bring about that change. We are turning the corner but it will take time. Parents were thanking me for not resigning, but I have no intention of doing that.\" Rebecca Smithers is the Guardian's education correspondent rebecca.smithers@theguardian.com",

      "bodyText": "The Home Office is being urged to set \"visibility\" targets which will compel police forces to put more officers in uniform, it emerged yesterday. The idea is part of a package of controversial measures recommended by the Police Superintendents' Association in a report which challenges many practices currently regarded as sacrosanct. It says forces in England and Wales should resist \"double crewing\" and send out officers on patrol on their own. Other recommendations include cutting the number of unmarked patrol cars and encouraging officers to eat in cafes instead of staff canteens. This is common practice in the US but has been frowned on by officers in Britain. The report, which is due to be sent to the home secretary, Jack Straw, next week, said many plain clothes officers should return to uniform. \"The public would see an enormous increase in the number of officers immediately, and the service would benefit as a result. \"We have reached the situation where an innocent member of the public could be standing next to a police officer without realising it, yet a criminal who invariably knows the identity of the unmarked car and its driver, would realise who the plain clothes officer was.\" The Superintendents' Association believes police must tackle a perception within the ranks that being a beat officer in uniform is \"the lowest of the low\". \"A visible presence on the streets provides deterrence and reassurance, key factors in the concept of policing by consent,\" the report continued. \"Those elements should not be sacrificed in the race to top the leagues of measurable indicators.\" The case for double crewing has been championed by officers on patrol, who argue they feel safer working in pairs. However, studies have shown officers are less likely to be assaulted if they patrol on their own. The report, entitled What the Public See is What They Think They Get, quotes from a thesis written by a Thames Valley officer which found double crewed cars \"present the biggest risk factor as far as assaults are concerned\". The association's president, Peter Gammon, said: \"We want to challenge and generate debate about the way officers work. \"The double crewing of police vehicles has become the norm and we are saying that there should be operational reasons for that, rather than just being routine practice.\" He added: \"There's a lot more police officers out there than people think. Some 17% are in plain clothes and if we reduce that by just 5% you would have another 6,000 extra officers in uniform.

It has also promoted a campaign urging ordinary people to stand up to the extreme right. Experts in the field, including sociologists, voluntary workers and officials of Germany's internal intelligence service, have all argued that the true problem is a rejectionist skinhead culture, which is particularly prevalent in the formerly communist east. The sort of music sought in the raids reported yesterday is an important underpinning of that culture, and Saxony-Anhalt is the part of the east where the culture seems to be most embedded. It has the highest rate of violent and far-right crime, and the capital, Magdeburg, is one of the few cities in Germany where extreme rightwingers have seats in the council chamber.

He is hoping this time to scoop the Leeds top prize. If he gets to the concerto final he will play Brahms's first concerto with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra; if he wins, it is a \u00a312,000 cheque and a presence on a roll of honour that includes Rafael Orozco, Murray Perahia, John Lill, and Jon Kimura Parker. This year Cristiano Burato returns. In 1996 he slipped and dislocated his shoulder minutes before he was due to appear before the adjudicators for the first time. He went home to Italy without having played a single competitive note.",

In the opening speech of the three-day UN millennium summit he will tell the leaders of more than 150 countries that the US endorses the establishment of a permanent peacekeeping high command to replace the present slow, ad hoc arrangement. But wrangling over who will meet the peacekeeping bill continued behind the scenes. The changes will run into millions of pounds and the US is desperately trying to reduce its share of peacekeeping costs. The US endorsement virtually guarantees acceptance of the peacekeeping reforms, published last month, drawn up by a UN panel headed by Lakhdar Brahimi, a former Algerian foreign minister. In Srebrenica, the UN was humiliated when its peacekeepers stood by while more than 7,000 men and boys were massacred by Serbs. A more catastrophic failure occurred in Rwanda, where up to a million were massacred. In Sierra Leone this year, 500 UN peacekeepers were taken hostage by a rebel force. As well as a permanent high command, the reform includes giving peacekeepers clearer-cut mandates and \"robust\" rules of engagement. Such changes might have helped in the Balkans, where UN peacekeepers found themselves unable to intervene because they did not have a mandate. But the UN reforms are in danger of being overshadowed by a series of meetings Mr Clinton is holding on the sidelines to try to revive the Middle East peace talks. Today he will have separate meetings with the Palestinian authority president, Yasser Arafat, and the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak. Sporadic demonstrations were held on the eve of the summit. Four Iranians were arrested for throwing yellow paint and another for disorderly conduct outside the hotel of the Iranian president, Mohammad Khatami. The city has given permits for 91 demonstrations during the summit, but there has been no sign of a repeat of the protests by anti-globalisation activists which caused mayhem in Seattle last year and in Washington earlier this year. Many of the leaders of the trade unions and environmental groups involved in those clashes have laid down their banners and teargas masks for the weekand are talking to representatives of big business and government at an alternative conference being staged in the city. More than 1,000 representatives from round the world gathered at the New York Hilton, about a mile from the UN headquarters, yesterday for the opening of the State of the World Forum. It is a diverse gathering, bringing together politicians, academics, soldiers, New Age spiritualists, representatives of multinational companies, as well as the trade union leaders and the environmental lobby. Jim Garrison, its organiser, said the Seattle protests had been beneficial in bursting the euphoria about globalisation. Mr Garrison, 49, an American academic and veteran campaigner against the nuclear arms race, said the forum was about channelling the protests which had been useful in focusing attention on the problems of globalisation. He added: \"We have to move from protest to engagement.\" The opening day of the forum brought together figures such as John Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO trade union organisation, George Soros, the financier, and Mikhail Gorbachev, the former Soviet president. Helen Clark, the New Zealand prime minister, who will speak at the UN millennium summit, made the trip across Manhattan to address the alternative forum. Other leaders scheduled to attend include Thabo Mbeki, the president of South Africa, and Olusegun Obsanjo, the Nigerian president. Mr Garrison said globalisation was ruthless, and questions such as the unequal distribution of wealth and the impact on the environment had to be discussed. He added that talks did not mean that future protests were ruled out. \u0095 North Korea announced yesterday that it had pulled out of the UN summit after a confrontation between its delegation and US security officials while they were passing though Frankfurt airport. The deputy foreign minister, Choe Su-hon, said the delegation decided to return home after \"rude and provocative\" treatment by US security staff, whom he accused of strip-searching members of the presidential entourage. www.worldforum.org",

But his emollient words in London were counter-balanced in Rangoon by junta tongue-lashings of Britain and the British ambassador in the Burmese capital. The Foreign Office minister John Battle said in London that he had summoned the Burmese ambassador, Kyaw Min, to protest at the military regime's crackdown on Ms Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD). He said the ambassador had admitted that there was \"a crisis\" in Rangoon, and then conceded that diplomatic access to Ms Suu Kyi might be granted \"within the next two weeks\". Amnesty International has expressed grave concern for the safety of Ms Suu Kyi and seven of her colleagues who are being held under house arrest. She has not been seen since September 2, when Burmese security forces ended her 10-day attempt to travel outside Rangoon, breaking up her roadside camp in the dead of night. Ms Suu Kyi is believed to be in her house in Rangoon but - with phone lines cut and the main gate padlocked - that has not been confirmed. Food is being handed in over the garden railings. A junta statement said that \"certain quarters of the NLD have been conspiring with some armed outlawed youth organisations [and] an armed terrorist group, God's Army. The group has its base on the Thai border. The statement said that while senior NLD members were not under arrest, they had been \"requested to stay at their respective residences and to cooperate with the government during the course of investigation\". Human rights groups say that allegations of terrorist links have been made in the past to justify the mass arrest of NLD supporters. The US charge d'affaires in Rangoon, Priscilla Clapp, called the allegations a \"malicious fabrication\". The head of military intelligence, General Khin Nyunt, restated the regime's assertive nationalistic line in a speech shortly before Ms Suu Kyi was forced to return home after trying to travel in her homeland. Foreign countries, he said, were \"using every pretext from forced labour and narcotic drugs, to [complaints about] health and education conditions to interfere in internal affairs\". He also accused \"two big western countries\" of trying to \"destroy\" Burma's international relations. Britain and the US are the two culprits in the regime's eyes, a message reinforced yesterday when the junta accused London's ambassador to Rangoon, John Jenkins, of overstepping \"universal diplomatic norms\" by trying to reach the house of the NLD's deputy chairman, Tin U, on Monday. Tin U was forcibly removed with Ms Suu Kyi from the encampment and has been confined to his home since then. A government statement said that Mr Jenkins had tried to \"force his way\" into Tin U's house before being blocked by a plainclothes security officer. \"It is difficult to understand why a foreign ambassador was so adamant to intrude into the internal affairs of an independent and sovereign nation,\" the aggrieved statement said. The restrictions placed on the NLD were no concern of the outside world, it said. \"The people who are involved are purely Myanmar [Burma] citizens and not British.\" British and US diplomats were not invited to a meeting on Monday when the Burmese deputy foreign minister, Khin Maung Win, met other envoys to give the junta's version of its crackdown on Ms Suu Kyi's party.

Along with the usual mix of middle-aged policemen talking and black-and-white reconstructions of key moments, Manhunt - Evil Calling used real footage of Sams being interviewed and the tapes made of phone calls he made to the police. While the tones of Janet Suzman were suitably gravitas-laden when describing the discovery of Dart's body, it was the sound of Sams' own voice that was the most chilling. The reason was simple: he didn't sound like \"evil calling\" at all. Actually, he sounded more like an irate Alan Bennett, perhaps after an argument with Mrs Gupta at the newsagent's (\"I told her I wasn't paying for last week's Radio Times because it was delivered in a condition verging on the papier-mch\u00e9. That caused quite a commotion amongst the Pan Drops.\"). He used words like \"monies\" and \"small penalties\" in his threatening letters, writing out in full the amount of money he was demanding. Excellent grammar doesn't an angel make, and Sams was a reminder of the banality of evil. </p> <p>Ransom notes pass through the Sooty-coloured gloves of unsuspecting post-office workers, milk floats amble absent-mindedly past the house of an abducted woman's family, communications with murderers are placed in the small ads above an advertisement for oatcakes: the details of the case were so frighteningly ordinary, evidence that badness doesn't come signposted, booming voice and hooded claw. Were Alan Bennett ever to write a police procedural thriller, this would be it. It would be called Blood On The Anaglypta. </p> <p> <strong> One Day In September</strong> (BBC2) will probably be remembered as the film which beat Buena Vista Social Club to the Oscar for best documentary at this year's Academy Awards, earning its place as a pub-quiz answer for robbing Wim Wenders of a prize it was assumed he deserved. This would be unfortunate, since One Day In September deserves its place in posterity for being an intelligent, exquisitely made, moving and dramatic documentary. Charting the events of the 5th of September at the Munich Olympic Games which led to the deaths of 11 Israeli athletes at the hands of Palestinian terrorists, it was genuinely epic in its sweep and so emotionally powerful, it had you desperately willing a happy ending to the film in the face of the bloody documented history. </p> <p>It began with the fond reminiscences of one woman, Ankie Spitzer, whose husband was one of the Israelis who was first held hostage and eventually killed. She was articulate and poetic as only the bereaved are, and, as she talked, footage from her wedding home-movie warmed the screen. From this already auspicious start, the film got more involving, wrapping up the personal with the political, and widening its horizons to encompass every aspect of the 1972 tragedy. From its use of sunny tourist-board films full of beer froth and busty blondes designed to emphasise the wholesome, diverse (and non-Nazi) nature of Munich, to the insensitivity of Olympic officials and the fact that it was a tragedy played out live on television, making it a spectator sport, One Day In September was a carefully carved sculpture, every shot and every beat of the exceptional soundtrack making the story all the more compelling. The result was a slowly building tension worthy of the best drama. </p> <p>Down <strong> Brookside</strong> (C4), a sinister-looking dolly has appeared in the Corkhill's lounge. With its staring glassy eyes and peculiar dress sense, it could easily be mistaken for Lindsey - she does have a touch of the wind-up doll about her - but rather it's one of those porcelain mannequins that are forever being possessed by malevolent spirits and terrorising their owners (mainly in horror films, it has to be said). So not that different from Lindsey at all. </p> <p>A vicious ghostly presence would certainly explain Jimmy's run of bad luck (that, and his various addictions) and his coming-along-nicely obsession with cleaning. Before you know it, he'll be up to his elbows in Mr Muscle, going bananas with a Swiffer. Indeed, were Kylie to stand still long enough, he'd give her a good going-over with a chamois leather.

      "body": "<p>When Abigail Morris was named artistic director of the Soho Theatre in 1992, some of her friends advised her against taking the job. The Soho, originally called the Soho Poly and founded as a lunchtime theatre by Verity Bargate and Frederick Proudin 1968, was one of London's first fringe venues and gave many famous writers their big break, from Barrie Keefe to Sue Townsend. But by the early 90s the company appeared to be in freefall. If Morris took the job, she might see her fledgling career go down with it. </p> <p>Now Morris sits in the meeting room at the top of a new \u00a310.5m theatre in Dean Street in the heart of Soho, having guided the company through its first season in its purpose-built home. At least 80% of seats have been sold for each production; a remarkable 73% of audience members were under the age of 35; the final play, Stop Kiss, had its run extended by two weeks; and Amanda Whittington's Be My Baby, about life in a home for unmarried mothers in the 1960s, is heading for the West End. </p> <p>This is not the first time Morris has pulled a rabbit out of the hat. In 1993, against the advice of those who predicted a marketing disaster, she followed her instincts and programmed Diane Samuels's Jewish refugee drama Kindertransport, which became a hit both in the West End and on Broadway. The same year, when she accepted a production of Jonathan Lewis's soldier drama Our Boys, theatres that had rejected it phoned her up to inform her that she was mad. Our Boys later transferred to the Donmar Warehouse. Even the decision to open the Dean Street theatre not with fanfares but with a low-key season of new work has paid off. </p> <p>But perhaps her greatest coup was persuading her bosses that a company with barely two pennies to rub together should buy its own building. In just eight years the Soho has gone from bust to boom, and Morris, whose only previous experience was running the feminist theatre company Trouble and Strife in the late 1980s, has become a major player in Britain's new-play culture. Any list of those most likely to shape Britain's theatre in the 21st century would be incomplete without Morris and the Soho's administrative director, Mark Godfrey. Some predict that this is a partnership to match that of Richard Eyre and David Aukin, who worked together in regional theatre before running the National. By coincidence, Aukin chairs the Soho's board. </p> <p>\"I had nothing to lose,\" Morris says of her decision to take the job at the Soho. Yet within weeks of arriving she found herself having to persuade the Arts Council not to withdraw its funding. Two years later the end once again appeared imminent when the company faced eviction from the Cockpit Theatre, an unlovely venue in north London where it had moved after being pushed out of the centre of the city in 1990. </p> <p>But Morris, small and wiry, is as tenacious as a terrier. She suggested to the board that the company find and convert its own building in central London. Someone spluttered that they'd probably need \u00a3100,000 - way beyond the ambitions and pocket of a small company like Soho. If the board members had known that the final cost would be 100 times as much, they would probably all have had heart attacks. </p> <p>But the timing could not have been better. Capital grants were just becoming available via the Lottery, and the Soho seized on the old synagogue in Dean Street, snatching it from the clutches of a company that wanted to turn it into a lap-dancing club. Then, when property prices in the capital went through the roof, the Soho did a deal with a developer that gave it a 200-seat theatre and writers' centre in return for the right to build flats above the venue. A restaurant covers the theatre's running costs, putting the company in the rare position of spending its subsidy on producing work rather than keeping the toilets clean. </p> <p>At \u00a3253,000, the Soho's grant is less than Hampstead Theatre's or the Bush's, and insufficient for a theatre with such an ambitious new writers' programme. But the company's first season in its new home has already had a major impact on the delicate ecology of new writing, and Morris's distinctive taste has provided a refreshing counter to the brutalism of so much new work. </p> <p>\"In the end choosing a play is very much like choosing a friend. You have a hunch,\" says Morris, whose \"hunches\" last season included eight plays, all box-office hits, of which six were written by women. There was no specific plan in this, but Morris may once again be ahead of the crowd. In the mid-90s she was one of the first programmers to realise that the modern theatre-goer has a preference for 90-minute mini-dramas rather than four-hour epics. (She claims only to have been reflecting her own short attention span.) </p> <p>Taken as a group, the astonishing thing about the plays in the first Soho season is that they pulled in audiences simply by focusing on the pain and pleasures of ordinary people leading ordinary lives. Morris is not afraid of the kind of violence that has become fashionable in the theatre (Alex Jones's Noise, staged when the Soho was camping out in the Dean Street synagogue before building was completed, was as uncomfortable and brutal as theatre gets) but the plays she chooses are less about shocking and more about telling stories. Even Noise sprang from that most common of situations - neighbours arguing about noise levels. </p> <p>Morris is reluctant to talk about either motherhood (she has two girls under five, making her that rarest of creatures, a female artistic director with small children) or religion (she is a practising Jew and won't work late on Fridays). But both seem to influence her choice of plays and her desire to tell stories. \"Telling stories is such a good way of drawing people in. It engages people on a deep level. It creates a dialogue and enables people,\" says Morris, who cites the story of her friend's parents, Polish Jews, who were hidden throughout the war by a woman who was anti-Semitic. \"I am interested in those kinds of stories, and theatre is a really good way of exploring the contradictions in people - their very many facets. People are complicated. It is not as simple as saying that Iago is more interesting than Othello.\" </p> <p>Certainly it is not the case in Morris's latest production, Navy Pier, a play about writing, ambition and creative and intellectual ownership, which opens the Soho's second season this week. Like almost all of the Soho's plays, this is theatre that approaches its subject slightly off centre but with a nose for accessibility. The chances are that it will be yet another hit. But Morris is taking no bets. \"In the theatre you can't ever second-guess, and in a way that is great. It means that however successful you become, you should never lose the freedom to go out on a limb, to say, 'That's the play that speaks to me, and that's the one I'm going to put on.' \" </p> <p>\u0095 Navy Pier is at the Soho Theatre, London W1 (020-7478 0100), from Thursday.</p>",

      "body": "<p> Steven Mackintosh is one of the more impressive film and TV actors at work in Britain today, but you would be forgiven for not immediately recognising him. Mackintosh submerges himself in his parts: the spliffy student Winston in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels; the farm hand lusted over by Rachel Weisz, Anna Friel and Catherine McCormack in Land Girls; the hero with a troubled past in the BBC's Our Mutual Friend. Mackintosh is practically invisible, too, as a player in the drama of his own life. He is not a man given to self-aggrandisement. </p> <p>This week he returns to the stage for the first time in eight years, starring alongside Julia Ormond and Tom Wilkinson in David Hare's My Zinc Bed at the Royal Court. Mackintosh, who plays a young poet involved with the wife of an entrepreneur for whom he works, is typically guileless about the project. \"I don't read a lot of plays, but I was deeply affected by this one,\" he enthuses, with something approaching holy respect for Hare. \"So to be asked to appear in it as well... I felt incredibly honoured and at the same time petrified.\" </p> <p>He is all too aware of the years that have passed since he last trod the boards. \"It's daunting having to deal with such a complex text and get accustomed to the ways of theatre acting again. I have no qualms about the writing, just about whether I can do it justice. </p> <p>\"Theatre,\" he maintains, \"is not something I know much about.\" </p> <p>That's a contrast to the screen, where Mackintosh has had a succession of high-profile roles since his rise to prominence in Hanif Kureishi's Buddha of Suburbia. This autumn sees him assume leading-man status - as the star of the TV drama Care, directed by Antonia Bird, about a man living with the consequences of child abuse, and the film The Criminal, in which he acts alongside his wife, Lisa Jacobs, and Eddie Izzard. </p> <p>But Mackintosh has never had an easy relationship with the theatre. Twenty years ago, at the tender age of 12, he starred in The Number of the Beast, Snoo Wilson's play about the satanist Aleister Crowley. \"I had to dash a mouse's brains out,\" he recalls. \"Then I had to shove it in my mouth and run round the stage shouting abuse at people.\" </p> <p>Small wonder, perhaps, that by his mid-20s Mackintosh was disillusioned with stage work. \"I don't feel I was particularly accomplished at it. I didn't like the productions I was doing, and I didn't like what I was doing in them. I'm just not an actor who thinks he can do absolutely everything. I know that there are some who can. But I can't.\" </p> <p>He tried Shakespeare under Peter Hall at the National Theatre in the 1980s, and has believed ever since that he \"can't do the classics on stage\". He doesn't watch them, either, blaming \"past experiences when I've come away from the theatre thinking about little else than how uncomfortable I was\". </p> <p>And Mackintosh does believe in being comfortable. In an industry that is characterised by self-destructive excess, he is famously domesticated: married at 21, he is now father to two daughters. </p> <p>\"Having a very settled home life is perfectly natural and exactly right. Anything wilder and more confusing I would find tiring and dull. I've done the wild lifestyle thing in the past - and it just makes you feel really bad.\" </p> <p>Mackintosh suggests his life is still being shaped by his early years in the theatre. \"Children can't make decisions about careers. Part of me wishes I'd got to a certain age and thought, 'Yes, this is what I want to do with my life.' People who just fall into it one day find themselves going, 'Oh, right, here I am, this is what I seem to be doing then.' I've always felt as if I'm riding a wave. </p> <p>\"Your attitude towards the job changes over the years. I've had times when I've felt very lost within it and felt, 'Maybe this isn't for me.' \" He doesn't feel that at the moment. \"I'm proud of where I'm at,\" he says. \"And if that carries on, it'll be great. But it goes through phases. Sometimes you sit at home thinking it's gone a bit quiet. Then suddenly something fantastic springs from nowhere.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Deep in the heart of London's Rotters Golf Club studios, the man who helped shape the sound of modern music greets me with his most sophisticated piece of equipment. This is not one of the samplers Andrew Weatherall used on Primal Scream's 1991 album Screamadelica, nor one of the studio consoles he used to work with Bjork. The \"gadget\" has four legs, a sharp snout and a ferocious bark. </p> <p>Weatherall admits to a reputation as a difficult interviewee, but this is ridiculous: I am granted an audience with him only if I can pacify a ferociously snapping Jack Russell. \"That's Morton,\" explains Weatherall. \"He's our wanker detector.\" </p> <p>It is difficult to imagine many people in the music business coming out with that sort of line, but then there aren't many people around like Weatherall. He now records (with partner Keith Tenniswood) as Two Lone Swordsmen, but his influence stretches back 10 years. Back in 1990 Weatherall - then one of the first acid-house DJs, at the London club Shoom - began fooling around with an obscure Primal Scream album track called I'm Losing More Than I'll Ever Have. Beginning with a now famous sample from Easy Rider, he mixed the song out of all recognition. The resulting anthem - renamed Loaded - moulded dance from rock and shaped a generation. </p> <p>After Screamadelica won the first Mercury music prize, Weatherall was tagged \"the Phil Spector of techno\". For much of the 90s, his was the name to drop as his blistering dance/rock/dub/ambient interfaces triggered off all sorts of new music. He remixed everybody from New Order to Happy Mondays to That Petrol Emotion. </p> <p>Weatherall also worked as a producer - notably with Beth Orton. At the same time, he was continuing his career as a DJ (although he apparently never thought of it as a career - \"I hate all that shit,\" he says). It's a wonder that he found time to be an artist - but he did, with the massively acclaimed Sabres of Paradise. Then there was his label, Sabresonic, and the London club of the same name where he virtually defined the term \"superstar DJ\". </p> <p>But more remarkable than any of this was that Weatherall chose to walk away. While many of his contemporaries were making millions, he started turning down remixes and productions. Then he was fired from his DJ job at Kiss FM for being, he says, \"too anarchic and eclectic\". After that he abandoned Sabres of Paradise and Sabresonic and in 1998 even left his beloved London - for a rented 18th-century vicarage five miles outside Pontefract. He just grew \"tired of dealing with wankers\", he says, and had grown to resent \"making music by committee, watering myself down\". </p> <p>Weatherall was born 37 years ago in suburban Windsor. As a boy, he searched for anything that proved the world \"wasn't as sterile as my surroundings\". He was a natural rebel. When his parents told him that punk, tattoos and staying out at night were bad, he plunged into all of them. He still wears the Clash's name on his arm. \"They were a big, big thing for me. They got me into reggae... stopped me from rigging up my school tie to the banisters,\" he says. In his late teens and early 20s Weatherall drifted. He got into scrapes and lived alone. He followed the early, culty New Order. There were several unfortunate haircuts, even a disastrous period as lead vocalist in a pre-acid groove band. \"We were called A Fractured Touch,\" he chuckles. \"How shite is that? Still, we always got a good turnout.\" </p> <p>Far more important - although he didn't realise it at the time - was a dalliance with the notorious Temple of Psychick Youth, the mysterious youth cult set up by Genesis P-Orridge of Throbbing Gristle and Psychic TV. Although Weatherall only communicated with the temple (\"I never got as far as the devil worship or posting bodily fluids\") they opened up his mind to all sorts of artforms. It was, he says, \"a subversive library\". </p> <p>After spells in bricklaying, Weatherall came to DJing more or less by accident. \"I always had a good record collection,\" he says. \"Looking back, I was probably the slightly anal child who would turn up when everyone else was getting off with birds, saying, 'Have you heard this B-side - it's really good?' \" </p> <p>As acid house exploded across Britain, club culture and Primal Scream changed his life. He remembers tiny, sweaty acid gigs \"buzzing with excitement\". He met the Scream at Shoom; however, Weatherall insists that Screamadelica is not his own creation. \"I like to think I lit the match,\" he says. \"They had all the ingredients but didn't know how to put them together. But they had beautiful tunes.

      "bodyText": "Deep in the heart of London's Rotters Golf Club studios, the man who helped shape the sound of modern music greets me with his most sophisticated piece of equipment. This is not one of the samplers Andrew Weatherall used on Primal Scream's 1991 album Screamadelica, nor one of the studio consoles he used to work with Bjork. The \"gadget\" has four legs, a sharp snout and a ferocious bark. Weatherall admits to a reputation as a difficult interviewee, but this is ridiculous: I am granted an audience with him only if I can pacify a ferociously snapping Jack Russell. \"That's Morton,\" explains Weatherall. \"He's our wanker detector.\" It is difficult to imagine many people in the music business coming out with that sort of line, but then there aren't many people around like Weatherall. He now records (with partner Keith Tenniswood) as Two Lone Swordsmen, but his influence stretches back 10 years. Back in 1990 Weatherall - then one of the first acid-house DJs, at the London club Shoom - began fooling around with an obscure Primal Scream album track called I'm Losing More Than I'll Ever Have. Beginning with a now famous sample from Easy Rider, he mixed the song out of all recognition. The resulting anthem - renamed Loaded - moulded dance from rock and shaped a generation. After Screamadelica won the first Mercury music prize, Weatherall was tagged \"the Phil Spector of techno\". For much of the 90s, his was the name to drop as his blistering dance/rock/dub/ambient interfaces triggered off all sorts of new music. He remixed everybody from New Order to Happy Mondays to That Petrol Emotion. Weatherall also worked as a producer - notably with Beth Orton. At the same time, he was continuing his career as a DJ (although he apparently never thought of it as a career - \"I hate all that shit,\" he says). It's a wonder that he found time to be an artist - but he did, with the massively acclaimed Sabres of Paradise. Then there was his label, Sabresonic, and the London club of the same name where he virtually defined the term \"superstar DJ\". But more remarkable than any of this was that Weatherall chose to walk away. While many of his contemporaries were making millions, he started turning down remixes and productions. Then he was fired from his DJ job at Kiss FM for being, he says, \"too anarchic and eclectic\". After that he abandoned Sabres of Paradise and Sabresonic and in 1998 even left his beloved London - for a rented 18th-century vicarage five miles outside Pontefract. He just grew \"tired of dealing with wankers\", he says, and had grown to resent \"making music by committee, watering myself down\". Weatherall was born 37 years ago in suburban Windsor. As a boy, he searched for anything that proved the world \"wasn't as sterile as my surroundings\". He was a natural rebel. When his parents told him that punk, tattoos and staying out at night were bad, he plunged into all of them. He still wears the Clash's name on his arm. \"They were a big, big thing for me. They got me into reggae... stopped me from rigging up my school tie to the banisters,\" he says. In his late teens and early 20s Weatherall drifted. He got into scrapes and lived alone. He followed the early, culty New Order. There were several unfortunate haircuts, even a disastrous period as lead vocalist in a pre-acid groove band. \"We were called A Fractured Touch,\" he chuckles. \"How shite is that? Still, we always got a good turnout.\" Far more important - although he didn't realise it at the time - was a dalliance with the notorious Temple of Psychick Youth, the mysterious youth cult set up by Genesis P-Orridge of Throbbing Gristle and Psychic TV. Although Weatherall only communicated with the temple (\"I never got as far as the devil worship or posting bodily fluids\") they opened up his mind to all sorts of artforms. It was, he says, \"a subversive library\". After spells in bricklaying, Weatherall came to DJing more or less by accident. \"I always had a good record collection,\" he says. \"Looking back, I was probably the slightly anal child who would turn up when everyone else was getting off with birds, saying, 'Have you heard this B-side - it's really good?' \" As acid house exploded across Britain, club culture and Primal Scream changed his life. He remembers tiny, sweaty acid gigs \"buzzing with excitement\". He met the Scream at Shoom; however, Weatherall insists that Screamadelica is not his own creation. \"I like to think I lit the match,\" he says. \"They had all the ingredients but didn't know how to put them together. But they had beautiful tunes. It was their record.\" Screamadelica brought him many things, but mostly the enormous pressure of following up one of the most influential albums of the 90s. \"Tell me about it!\" he suddenly erupts. \"How much pressure is that?\" Weatherall veered away from rock bands and plunged into dance. \"I now had more money,\" he says. \"Also, I was now taking drugs. I had people putting a microphone in front of me. All the magazines I'd revered for years as a kid living in the suburbs wanted to know my opinion. Add ecstasy, cocaine and acid, what you gonna get? A bit of a loose cannon.\" At the height of his mania, he was prone to leaping around in a greatcoat, wielding a cutlass. \"You know you're in trouble when you're a DJ and you keep taking off the record that's actually playing,\" he chuckles. However, somewhere in the fug, the young punk in Weatherall came back and told him that he was turning into one of the wankers. He walked away. The sojourn in Yorkshire achieved its purpose. Now, clearer of head, Weatherall has re-emerged as one of the few truly important underground artists in Britain. The way Two Lone Swordsmen work (isolated from the mainstream, recording almost daily, selling singles by mail order) is rooted in punk and DIY.

The situation has been amplified by the high failure rate of cluster bombs, used exclusively by Nato during airstrikes on Kosovo last year, according to the Red Cross report. It shows that unexploded bomblets were found up to 1km from their intended targets and that their failure rate was higher than stated in public. The report quoted a K-For ordnance disposal expert as saying that an average of 15% of cluster bombs, rising to 26%, failed to explode completely. Cluster bombs contain dozens, or hundreds, of small bomblets which are released and spread over a wide area before they hit the ground. The sub-munitions are meant to explode on impact. In the year after Nato's bombing campaign ended in June last year , 151 people in Kosovo were killed or injured by unexploded bomblets. The Red Cross also found that cluster bombs killed or maimed five times more Kosovan children than landmines. \"This may be due to the fact that such sub-munitions are often brightly coloured, lying on the ground and assumed to be 'duds',\" the report said.

Then there's Dress Me Becks and Action Patrick Vieira (press a button and he loses his head!), not to mention Tiny Tears Gascoigne. Let's face it, we're in the money. Not to be confused with: The real Roy Keane (after all, he's about a fifth of the size).",

Thousands of scientists will attempt to plumb the depths of the human soul and the mysteries of outer space in the quest for an amicable meeting of mind and matter. The week-long Jubilee of the Universities reaches its climax on Saturday, when the Pope will meet the delegates. Neuroscientists will have a chance to delve into the organic seat of the immortal soul when a three-day conference begins in the Vatican this morning. Entitled Architectures of the Mind, Architectures of the Brain, the gathering will be addressed by luminaries such as Professor Richard Frackowiak of the Institute of Neurology in London and Professor Steven Pinker of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Those hoping for a final solution in the battle between Hobbesian materialists, who recognise the soul only as an epiphenomenon of organised matter, and the Idealists, who deny the existence of the material world except as a creation of the knowing mind, may be disappointed. \"Studies of the soul are still in a pioneering stage,\" said Gabriele Miceli, a professor of neurology at the Catholic University in Rome, the organiser of the conference. \"These topics don't lend themselves to an experimental approach.

Aberdeen was one of nine cash strapped British museums where Christmas came early, as the Art Fund, the independent art charity, distributed 39 pieces, together conservatively valued at over \u00a3200,000, on behalf of the collector Charles Saatchi. Mr Saatchi is renowned for buying the entire studio contents of artists who take his fancy. His collection was the basis of the exhibition entitled Sensation, which made young British artists such as Damien Hirst international superstars. His annual clearout is becoming an eagerly awaited event - last year he gave 100 works, valued at \u00a3600,000, to the Arts Council collection. The previous year he sold works by Hirst, Chris Ofili and Sarah Lucas, and raised \u00a31.6m to create bursaries for young artists. He gave the latest batch away through the Art Fund, which offered museums and galleries with a particular interest in contemporary art a list including works by Jordan Baseman, Marcus Taylor, Richard Woods and Katherine Dowson. \"It really was like Christmas as the crates arrived and we began unpacking our presents,\" said Robert Dickinson, principal curator at Swindon museum and gallery, which got a piece by Jeffrey Dennis and a nobly entitled work by John Greenwood: Rings &amp; Strings &amp; Things (No Wings but there is some Jelly as Always). All the museums and galleries on yesterday's list have seen acquisition budgets cut hard in local authority spending cuts, which have left many museums in crisis. Aberdeen's purchase fund was slashed from \u00a324,000 to \u00a32,000, and as Ms Melville learned at a meeting yesterday, is now zero. The 10 Saatchi works fill an increasingly gaping hole in her collection.

The soldiers from the Royal Highland Fusiliers, who are based at Fort George, near Inverness, were caught during a random sample of 262 soldiers of all ranks on a tour of duty near Hamburg. They are in the process of being discharged, but have the right of appeal. It is the latest in a series of drug incidents in the armed forces, many concerning Scottish regiments. In June, 11 soldiers of the Black Watch, also based at Fort George, were discharged after failing drugs tests, and a month earlier eight soldiers with the 1st Battalion Royal Scots, and seven from the Queen's Dragoon Guards, were dismissed. The Ministry of Defence introduced a drug testing programme and zero tolerance policy in 1995. Since then 323,000 male and female soldiers have been tested, 2,500 have tested positive for drugs, and 1,800 have been discharged. The tests, which are carried out with less than 24 hours notice, are for any illegal substance, including cannabis, heroin and cocaine. Yesterday, a spokeswoman for the army in Scotland confirmed that soldiers from the Royal Highland Fusiliers had been disciplined, but denied there was evidence of widespread drug misuse. She said a rigid testing procedure had been responsible for bringing offenders to light and there was no deep-seated problem. The MoD has declined to comment on reports that the Royal Highland Fusiliers had tested positive for cocaine and ecstasy. An MoD spokesman said the forces were aware of drug abuse issues and intended to remain on top of the situation. The spokesman added: \"There is a careful screening programme at the recruitment stage and an ongoing programme of drug awareness.\"",

      "bodyText": "NSPCC, the children's charity, is scaling down an ambitious programme to eradicate child abuse after failing to meet a \u00a3250m fundraising target within the expected timescale. The Full Stop initiative was launched in March 1999. NSPCC managers set a target of \u00a3250m in donations and pledges within 12 months and prepared plans to increase spending on services for children to more than \u00a37.5m a month. But the charity told its staff yesterday: \"The rapid growth of children's services is to be slowed down to reflect a revised cashflow.\" In the first 18 months of the appeal the NSPCC raised \u00a370m in cash and pledges. Appeal organisers said a further \u00a3100m was forthcoming, but not firmly committed. That projected income of \u00a3170m over 18 months falls well short of the \u00a3250m target over 12 months. But the charity said it was confident it would reach \u00a3250m by the end of this year in cash, firm pledges and anticipated \"secure income streams\". David Prescott, chief operating officer, said the appeal should not be regarded as a failure. \"Over the last three years or so, expenditure on children's services has risen by about 60%. We have reached the point where we are cautious about further growth in expenditure until the appeal starts to accelerate again.\" Mr Prescott rejected allegations that extension of the NSPCC appeal until the end of this year would squeeze out the fundraising efforts of other children's charities.",

And he didn't leave his home telephone number or address, so I couldn't send anyone round to kneecap him. I have given my all for Yorkshire and England for the last 12 years, and obviously it hurts to get letters accusing me of not pulling my weight.\" Gough's disgust might be one of the reasons why he has been seen househunting in Buckinghamshire, although he has no immediate intention to change counties. England resisted Yorkshire's requests last month that they should release Gough for the climax to the championship, insisting that he must be allowed the rest and recuperation that would be granted to other leading fast bowlers the world over. With Yorkshire's championship challenge in disarray anyway, the issue has become less intense, but the county will still press this winter for a re-examination of the central contracts system in the belief that its over-use will bring about a damaging fall in standards at county level. Yorkshire might also consider whether it is just coincidence that while Gough has remained fit this summer, under sympathetic handling, their own highly-rated group of fast bowlers have been badly hit by injury. Gough, swinging the ball at 90mph and a fullish length, and the more angular, taller figure of Andrew Caddick became the first England new-ball pair to bowl throughout a series since Fred Trueman and Brian Statham against South Africa 40 years earlier. \"We have had four good pace bowlers for England this summer, and now we are going out to Pakistan to learn how to bowl there,\" said Gough. \"From what I've read, the pitches do get uneven in bounce and hopefully we can exploit that.\" \"Three of us can reverse swing the ball and Andy Caddick can expect his usual uneven bounce. If we can stay fit, we've got a chance.\"",

The crowd that gathered at the Oval on Monday to witness the last rites and exult was proof positive that in international sport it is success rather than characters that captures the imagination. </p> <p>The signs were there in South Africa. Hussain and Duncan Fletcher, the new coach, stressed repeatedly that England were there to learn as much as to win. They wished to compete but they, particularly the coach, needed information: what was in the stockroom and what was lacking; who had heart and who did not; which techniques and temperaments stood up to close scrutiny; and who were the workers? </p> <p>It was as much a process of elimination as anything, confirmation that for all the knee-jerk calls for overhauls and new blood in the aftermath of the defeat by New Zealand a year ago, it was not as straightforward as that. A point was proved: only seven of that touring party - Hussain, Mike Atherton, Alec Stewart, Michael Vaughan, Andy Caddick, Darren Gough and, to a small extent Andy Flintoff, survived into the summer. </p> <p>Instead Hussain and Fletcher began to look elsewhere. Mark Ramprakash was tried as an opener, failed and was discarded, Nick Knight's technique did not stand the test, Flintoff's technique, fitness and commitment were found lacking, Ed Giddins' bowling lacked bite when the going got tough, Chris Schofield's legspin was not trusted and Robert Croft's offspin was a disaster. </p> <p>But the selectors had found enough in Craig White's bowling in the one-day series in South Africa (when he replaced the injured Flintoff) to give him a central contract and then detected a new spirit in Dominic Cork. Hussain's broken finger, the triangular tournament and Fletcher's intuition and judgment saw the emergence of Marcus Trescothick, Graham Thorpe was reinstated and suddenly the side had a steely look to it. </p> <p>Hussain must take a lot of credit. His appointment, in the wake of England's desperate showing in the World Cup, was not universally popular, not just with armchair critics. Some members of his side feared an intense self-centred cricketer running the show. The big test would come, they said, if and when Hussain's form deteriorated and the dark brooding moods held sway. </p> <p>Almost as if it were pre-ordained, Hussain had a torrid time this summer, with 92 runs from 10 Test innings culminating in a pair at the Oval, but throughout has remained forceful, purposeful and dignified. If his instinct is to temper his celebrations by regretting his lack of contribution with the bat this summer, he should be told again and again that it is barely nine months since he was holding the side together by batting for longer than anyone ever had in Tests, and has since been a massively influential figure who has given everything. The manner in which, as the final wicket fell, he slumped to the ground was a picture of an obsessively focused man close to mental exhaustion. No one has earned a break more. </p> <p>As for Fletcher, it is little more than a year ago that the England and Wales Cricket Board was devoting its energies to pursuing the then South African coach Bob Woolmer to succeed David Lloyd. Eventually, searching elsewhere, it spoke to Fletcher, a Zimbabwean coaching Glamorgan and Western Province, and gives thanks for the day it did. Fletcher is an accomplished coach, perceptive, intolerant of under-achievement, inspirational and wary, and keeps a low profile. He commands total respect and has forged the strongest of bonds with Hussain. </p> <p>There is backbone to the side now, starting with Mike Atherton, who has been outstanding. Why did we know that, when it came to the crunch, at Lord's and at the Oval, he would be the one to produce the goods. His single-mindedness is a clich\u00e9 but remains remarkable for all that. </p> <p>Stewart continues to prove that he has been the finest allrounder in the world for years if only those in England would take notice and Vaughan has now played two match-winning innings in the last five of his eight Tests. The batting remains collapsible but, helped by a genuine player at seven, it is getting there. </p> <p>The real revelation, though, has been the bowling. Central contracts have ensured that, if Gough and Caddick, in particular, are fit at the end of a Test, they are going to be fit for the start of the next. Fletcher has cranked Gough up another gear, rediscovering his away swinger that was so devastating to the West Indian left-handers. He bowls with pace, verve, belligerence and massive self-belief and is genuinely world-class. </p> <p>So, too, is Caddick. The transformation came at Lord's when someone - Hussain, Fletcher or both - read him his fortune after an indifferent first innings. In the second he was brutal, bringing short-leg into the action, and has not looked back. Pakistan wickets will test his resolve but he has the confidence to overcome that. </p> <p>Cork has been a perfect foil, picking off wickets and seizing the Lord's Test by the scruff when it seemed lost, while White has emerged as a genuinely fast, accurate employer of reverse swing.</p>",
