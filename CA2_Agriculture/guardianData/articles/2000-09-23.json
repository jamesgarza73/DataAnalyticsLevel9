To compound the problem, Mozart's prose style is wild and noisy, a cacophony of different voices, styles and languages. Grammar eludes him, whether out of fickleness or ignorance.

Hans Mersmann's sanitised edition of 1928 (translated by M.M.

Eric Blom produced a popular edition for Penguin in the 1950s, when strait-laced gentility reached an all-time low. The standard text, however, has long been Emily Anderson's of 1938, despite its tendency to endow Mozart's prose with fictitious literary elegance.

The hazards and delays of receiving post provides a subplot throughout, yet he still managed to maintain a frequent correspondence, and narratives are carried from letter to letter giving invaluable insight into his daily life and preoccupations. </p> <p>His references to music tend to be practical: finding manuscript paper, copying parts, despatching scores, the inadequacy of this violinist or that pianist. When artistic questions do arise, he dashes any lingering misconception that his music came effortlessly. Obstacles usually sprang from external circumstance rather than loss of artistic direction.</p> <p>In 1781, after he fell out with his employer, the Archbishop of Salzburg, Mozart wrote to his carping father: 'Believe me I don't enjoy leisure, I love to work - in Salzburg, yes it's true I had to make an effort, and I could almost not get myself to work, but why? - because my spirits were down... you have to admit yourself that in Salzburg [...] there isn't a penny's worth of stimulation; [...] it is as if the audience consisted of nothing but tables and chairs.' In 1791, when he was completing The Magic Flute, he wrote that: 'Out of sheer boredom I composed an aria for my opera today.'</p> <p>Such remarks are rare. Uppermost in his mind are the struggle for money (with several begging letters near the end), recognition and regular work. His deteriorating relationship with Leopold makes a pitiful tale.

At times, he shows no emotion, as in the deaths in infancy of four of his six children. The manner in which he informs his father and sister of his mother's demise nevertheless shows just how skilful he was at deploying language and tone when he chose.</p> <p>It also calls into question the fashionable belief that he suffered from Tourette syndrome. On the contrary, he knew precisely what he wanted to say and said it. His mother, in any case, wrote in a similarly earthy vein. What regular correspondents have not developed their own in-jokes and private language? (Elgar's letters are another example of the eternal schoolboy.)

At the time of his father's death in 1787, only four years before his own, Mozart was preoccupied with mortality. He had recently suffered from kidney disease, and the 29-year-old doctor who treated him was himself dying.

So well did the evening go, with laughter and lofty debate punctuating noble declamations from both poets, that it became known, at least to Haydon in his copious diary, as 'the Immortal Dinner'. </p> <p>Above the table hung the host's huge, half-finished masterpiece, Christ's Entry Into Jerusalem, into whose crowd of spectators Haydon would insert the faces of Wordsworth and Keats, not to mention Voltaire and Newton. Shelley was not at the dinner, nor in the picture, because of his atheism. So what about Voltaire? </p> <p>This was something for Haydon's guests to argue about, suggests Penelope Hughes-Hallett in this engaging if almost wholly speculative reconstruction of the proceedings, gleaned from the letters and diaries of those present (and indeed absent). </p> <p>With little to go on beyond Lamb's drunken quips and Wordsworth's solemn toast to Haydon, Hughes-Hallett devotes as much of her investigative energies to those not at the dinner, but who might have been, or might have been under discussion, as to the odd assortment who were.

      "bodyText": "The Immortal Dinner Penelope Hughes-Hallett Viking \u00a315.99, pp336 Buy it at BOL On 28 December, 1817 the painter Benjamin Haydon gave a dinner party at his London home to introduce the promising young poet John Keats to the mighty William Wordsworth. Also present were the essayist Charles Lamb, who got entertainingly drunk, the doomed explorer Joseph Ritchie and sundry hangers-on. So well did the evening go, with laughter and lofty debate punctuating noble declamations from both poets, that it became known, at least to Haydon in his copious diary, as 'the Immortal Dinner'. Above the table hung the host's huge, half-finished masterpiece, Christ's Entry Into Jerusalem, into whose crowd of spectators Haydon would insert the faces of Wordsworth and Keats, not to mention Voltaire and Newton. Shelley was not at the dinner, nor in the picture, because of his atheism. So what about Voltaire? This was something for Haydon's guests to argue about, suggests Penelope Hughes-Hallett in this engaging if almost wholly speculative reconstruction of the proceedings, gleaned from the letters and diaries of those present (and indeed absent). With little to go on beyond Lamb's drunken quips and Wordsworth's solemn toast to Haydon, Hughes-Hallett devotes as much of her investigative energies to those not at the dinner, but who might have been, or might have been under discussion, as to the odd assortment who were. Hazlitt, for instance, was in the painting, but not at the table because his religious beliefs were also suspect, and he had recently had the nerve to criticise Wordsworth. Another conspicuous absentee was the poet and critic Leigh Hunt, who had first introduced Haydon to Keats and Shelley, but whose wife had recently annoyed him by failing to return some borrowed silverware. Wordsworth was ill at ease about the presence of the sole, self-invited guest, a pompous civil servant named John Kingston, who was his immediate superior at the Stamp Office. So the stage was set for conversation as heated as high-minded, which might or might not have concerned a variety of topical issues lavishly chronicled by Hughes-Hallett for background ballast. After meeting the host at some length, we follow his various guests' progress across London to his house in Lisson Grove, complete with weather bulletins ('dull but dry') and progress reports on the construction of such novelties as Waterloo Bridge and Regent Street, en route to breathless detail of the menu and wine list, even the identity of the head waiter. With the debate over the newly arrived Elgin Marbles at its height, we are then treated to a thorough briefing on Lord Elgin and his booty's controversial progress towards the British Museum. We also meet close-up the likes of the scientist and poet Sir Humphry Davy (not at the dinner, but a friend of Wordsworth's); the actress Sarah Siddons (not at the dinner, but a friend of Haydon's); the surgeon William Brande (not at the dinner, but medical mentor of Keats and Ritchie); and the Bashaw of Tripoli (not at the dinner, but a major player in Ritchie's future). One whole chapter of eight anatomises the then state of the slave trade, tuberculosis, Africa and the exploration thereof as we join Ritchie on his subsequent, fatal expedition, with Keats's Endymion in his pocket, in brave but vain search of the source of the Niger. This is presumably because Ritchie's recently discovered letters are Hughes-Hallett's only truly original material. But her thorough scouring of all other relevant sources results in a colourful, if partial, portrait of a pivotal moment in England's cultural and social history, two years after the Battle of Waterloo. And it is an engagingly dotty notion to base it all on a dinner party which only its over-excited host (whom we also follow towards his penurious suicide 30 years later) considered as momentous as she does.

His lost son also became a kind of ideal, a standard against which his real, present sons could never measure favourably. </p> <p>Ernest's greatest literary success was the novel The Plymouth Adventure, made into a film starring Spencer Tracy, but as his wife's literary reputation waxed, so did his jealousy and resentment, until the couple finally divorced. Ernest's energies were then devoted to turning his boys against their mother, and punishing them if they refused to adopt his hatred. </p> <p>Years later, as his father began to suffer from Alzheimer's, Gebler learned a few hidden details of his father's life that went some way to explaining his coldness and insecurity; the fact that his own father, a musician, had a young prot\u00e9g\u00e9 whom he treated as a favourite son, and who displaced Ernest in his father's affections just as he then allowed the absent 'first Karl' to displace his own son. It is only after Ernest's death, and the author's meeting with his lost half-brother, that Carlo reads his father's diaries and concludes that he had suffered from clinical depression, unable to admit or even to understand his condition. </p> <p>Gebler builds up a meticulous picture of his father, but the difficulty with this kind of book is that experience, especially childhood experience, doesn't have a clear narrative and often lacks pace and drama. Fragments of memory are loosely taped together but the movement of the book is uneven and much of it feels like padding to augment the central relationship. </p> <p>Another difficulty is the inconsistency of the authorial voice; at times, he is trying to write in the novelistic, child-like, Andrea Ashworth style of memoir, replete with wide-eyed description of sights and smells, and at others, unpredictably, the analytical voice of the adult writer appears, viewing his childish self with all the wisdom and self-knowledge of hindsight. </p> <p>There are moments of genuine insight about human relations, particularly as Gebler witnesses the deterioration of his father's mind.

This stands for almost all of McInerney's stories in this collection. </p> <p>As Prout and his wife listen to a frustratingly beautiful couple telling the tale of how they met, he comments on his own marriage in which familiarity is bordering on disgust. In these pieces, discontent rumbles everywhere. If something hasn't just ended, then certainly the end is somewhere in sight. </p> <p>There is a superb piece of comedy in 'Simple Gifts', in which a couple, desperate to show their love for each other, make an unfortunate mistake one Christmas Eve.

This stands for almost all of McInerney's stories in this collection. As Prout and his wife listen to a frustratingly beautiful couple telling the tale of how they met, he comments on his own marriage in which familiarity is bordering on disgust. In these pieces, discontent rumbles everywhere. If something hasn't just ended, then certainly the end is somewhere in sight. There is a superb piece of comedy in 'Simple Gifts', in which a couple, desperate to show their love for each other, make an unfortunate mistake one Christmas Eve. As one takes drugs to keep awake, thinking her partner longs to go out, the other takes drugs to go to sleep, certain his partner is exhausted.

      "body": "<p>Jayne Anne Phillips was only 26 when her first book, a collection of short stories called Black Tickets, was published to immediate and ecstatic acclaim - Raymond Carver called them stories 'unlike any in our literature... this book of hers is a crooked beauty'; Nadine Gordimer hailed her as the best short story writer since Eudora Welty. </p> <p>Now she is in her late forties, with lines on her austere and beautiful medieval face and grey in her long, dark hair; the turbulence of her life is concealed behind an air of intelligent watchfulness. She has published only four books in the intervening 20 years - Machine Dreams, Fast Lanes, Shelter and now MotherKind (Cape \u00a315.99, pp304). She is, she admits with a rueful laugh, slow. 'Yes. A slow writer. Life gets in the way. I have to fit my writing around the edges of it.' </p> <p>By life, she means not only her other work - teaching writing in workshops and on literature courses - but also 'children, friends, cooking, chores. You know. All those things. Laundry. Life.' All those things, the little, ordinary things, are the subject and what little there is of narrative in MotherKind (Phillips says alarmingly that she 'isn't really interested in narrative; I don't really believe in it'). </p> <p>Two stories are plaited together in this richly melancholy novel (story is too strong a word for the soft, unfolding of emotion): birth and death. As one life begins, another ends. They are made to seem very close to each other, suffused with the same thick and dreamy light. </p> <p>Kate is the woman who loses a mother as she becomes one. She is a poet who, after a lifetime of relationships with other artists that were more like 'conflagrations', has met kind, steady, tender Matt, a doctor who has left his unfaithful wife. He already has two sons who adore him and blame him and blame Kate and crash around the new couple's small house at weekends, needy and insistent. </p> <p>At the start, Kate is pregnant. She can feel 'the tremor in the deep, wet dark of her body, so small, yet not imagined... like a minnow in water, Kate thinks, the flutter of a soul'. She is going back to her home town to visit her mother, Katherine, who has cancer and is dying. As Kate's baby grows, so does Katherine's tumour. Both women are waiting, listening to their bodies. </p> <p>The mother comes to live with the daughter and her household of males. She lies in an upstairs bedroom, propped up by pillows. Kate cooks, writes, sits with her mother and talks about old memories. The baby is born, a boy with a velvety skull, ripping into the world, filling the house with his inconsolable cries and whimpers, the smell of milk, bibs in the washing machine. The mother grows weaker, but gradually.</p> <p>Days are slow with female needs: the suckling baby, the dying mother with the hot skin, bread rising in the oven, fat trimmed from the meat; the gummy baby, the milky smell, the floury potatoes in the pan, a man's hand clasping a woman's high-arched foot, ice on the streets, the sweat on the brow of the dying woman, the mingling smell of life and death. </p> <p>Matt is still there, but seems far off in the novel, which feels uncontemporary, more like a dim, rich Vermeer interior, two women stooping over a baby in the soft light; peeled fruit on a plate. Nothing really happens, except that time passes, which is the point. The baby says his first words and Katherine starts to lose speech. The baby learns to totter on his thready legs and Katherine can no longer raise herself out of her bed. The baby stops crying for food, but now Katherine's breathing, laboured and guttural, echoes through the house, making everyone silent. We don't see her dying, just as we don't see the son being born. We see Kate woken in the night and entering the dark room where her mother is leaving. No words are spoken. The novel becomes silence. </p> <p>Phillips's mother died of cancer the year her son was born. She, too, had chemotherapy so that she could see her grandchild. 'That much is true. But I wasn't there like Kate. I was there as a daughter. I wasn't there as a writer. There's a lot I don't remember, blanks around certain peaks. The mother isn't my mother, although the closeness between mother and daughter was our closeness. I knew one day I would have to put it into words, in order to understand it, redeem something. </p> <p>'But in the wake of my mother's death I wrote Shelter, which is - although I didn't see it at the time - about orphans, and which goes beyond family to something primal, tribal. I needed distance to create a world that corresponded to my experience, but which I was free from. I felt I found my mother again - what she was before she was dying, and what she became beyond it. I don't think that is a consolation; I don't think there is consolation. But there is acceptance and understanding of death and your place beside it. But you have to go through it; that's the only way to survive - and if you go through it, then something survives beyond it. And that something is love.' </p> <p>She talks with great intensity about writing. 'I am very self-censoring,' she says. 'And language-oriented. I write line by line, by the sound and the weight and the music of the words. I don't do much rewriting, because each paragraph is very carefully put together. I don't investigate things by writing about them, but let them build up inside of me. </p> <p>'With MotherKind, I was asking: what is death? What is being alive? I wanted to write about that milky, sensual space in an infant's life, and in the mother's, where identities are melted. </p> <p>'Divinity,' she says, with no irony. 'That's what I'm trying to get at, in everything I write.' She does not mean 'an eye in the sky', but 'the eye of the self perhaps, the finding of meaning. Writing takes a stand against randomness'. She has always felt that writing is 'forbidden, an act of transgression'. </p> <p>When she was a child, growing up in West Virginia, in a place where her family had lived for 300 years, 'everyone knew everyone's stories, but the stories were secret. As the writer in my family, I felt that I was the person who was charged with making sure all these stories and ideas survive, but at the same time you're not allowed to tell anyone. Writing is the telling of secrets. Secrets have to be told. It's terrible if they're not, but if you tell the secrets, they can transform and unite one moment with another, and bridge the gulf between time, distance, difference.' </p> <p>Nevertheless, she says drily, her mother is 'quite happy not to be here for the publication of this particular book. She thought there were certain things that shouldn't be talked about. She wished I'd shut up. But I couldn't.'</p>",

      "byline": "Helen Pridham",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Everyone should aim to have some easily accessible savings to fall back on in a bank or building society account. This means almost everyone could potentially benefit from a cash Isa. </p> <p>Cash Isas work just like other deposit accounts with the important difference that all the interest you earn is tax-free. Their other major advantage is the competitive rates of interest that most pay. Most offer instant access. </p> <p>The sooner you switch to a cash Isa the more you can gain. The Portman Building Society recently pointed out that by switching \u00a31,000 from any high street instant access account to a cash Isa, savers can immediately improve the return on their savings. 'Since the average net rate on ordinary instant access accounts is 1.22 per cent against an average tax-free rate of 6.3 per cent on cash Isas, savers could typically see the daily return on their \u00a31,000 investment rise from just 3 pence to 17 pence,' says the Portman. </p> <p>The only disadvantage of opening a so-called 'mini' cash Isa, in which you can deposit up to \u00a33,000 during the current tax year, is that it will also restrict the amount you can invest in a stocks and shares Isa this year to \u00a33,000. Without a cash Isa, you could put up to \u00a37,000 into a 'maxi' stocks and shares Isa. </p> <p>For many savers with modest sums, these limits will not be a problem. If you are saving for a specific short-term objective such as the deposit on a house or a new car and cannot afford to take risks with your money, a cash Isa is a better bet anyway. Stocks &amp; shares Isas are risky investments and are only suitable for periods of five years plus. </p> <p>However, before you rush to open a cash Isa, check out where you can get the best rates. Some organisations are less than generous, especially with smaller savers. The Halifax, for example, pays only 4.15 per cent to Isa investors with under \u00a31,000 to invest, while Northern Ireland's First Trust Bank Isa offers a positively miserly rate of 1.25 per cent on amounts of less than \u00a32,000. At the other end of the rate scale, the internet bank Smile is offering 7.25 per cent on its cash Isa , while the Britannic and Nationwide Building Societies are paying 6.85 per cent. All these rates apply to amounts of \u00a31 or more. </p> <p>When comparing rates, it is also worth looking at what your local building society has to offer. Several of the smaller regional societies, such as the Coventry, the Market Harborough and the Principality, are offering some of the best rates around on their cash Isas but are restricting access to local or existing investors for fear of attracting carpetbaggers. </p> <p>But it is not only headline interest rates that need to be compared. Accessibility is another important feature. Although the majority of cash Isas are instant access accounts, there are many which require between 7 and 90 days' notice of withdrawals. While some are competitive, notice accounts do not necessarily pay a better return than the instant access variety. Two examples of less attractive offerings are Standard Life Bank's 50-day notice Isa which currently pays only 5.85 per cent, and Birmingham Midshires' 90-day notice account at 6 per cent. </p> <p>A fixed rate Isa may be worth considering if you believe interest rates may fall in the future. There are not many fixed rate accounts on offer at present, but they are available from the Julian Hodge Bank, and the Leeds &amp; Holbeck and Norwich &amp; Peterborough building societies. The best rates are offered by the Julian Hodge Bank. For terms ranging from one to five years, it is currently paying fixed rates of between 6.5 per cent and 6.85 per cent but withdrawals are not permitted until the end of the term. </p> <p>Naturally, if you want to maximise the tax advantages, it is better not to make withdrawals from your cash Isa unless you need the money. Once you have subscribed the maximum annual amount, no further deposits are allowed, not even to top up after withdrawals. What's more, unless the Chancellor has another change of heart as he did in the last Budget, this year could be your last chance to invest \u00a33,000. After that the annual limit is due to fall to \u00a31,000. </p> <p>However, the advantage of having an instant account is that it makes it easier to transfer your savings if you discover you can get a better interest rate elsewhere. You can still retain your tax advantages providing you follow the right procedures. A spokesman for Nationwide explains: 'The first thing you should do is to open a new Isa account explaining to the provider that you wish to transfer. But do not put in any fresh money otherwise you will have two cash Isas open at once which is not allowed. You can then go back to your existing provider and obtain a certificate showing how much you have subscribed and when, and also complete a transfer form. You present that certificate to your new Isa provider who will arrange the transfer from your old account.' </p> <p>Most Isa providers will accept incoming transfers, but not all. Abbey National, for example, does not. Spokesman Gug Kyriacou says: 'Cash Isas involve a lot of admin and we wanted to avoid Isa surfers - investors who are always moving their money around whenever a better rate is offered.' In fact, with its top rate of just 6.35 per cent, there seems little danger of this happening. Abbey National's customers may be better off transferring elsewhere, and luckily outward transfers are not restricted.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Everyone should aim to have some easily accessible savings to fall back on in a bank or building society account. This means almost everyone could potentially benefit from a cash Isa. Cash Isas work just like other deposit accounts with the important difference that all the interest you earn is tax-free. Their other major advantage is the competitive rates of interest that most pay. Most offer instant access. The sooner you switch to a cash Isa the more you can gain. The Portman Building Society recently pointed out that by switching \u00a31,000 from any high street instant access account to a cash Isa, savers can immediately improve the return on their savings. 'Since the average net rate on ordinary instant access accounts is 1.22 per cent against an average tax-free rate of 6.3 per cent on cash Isas, savers could typically see the daily return on their \u00a31,000 investment rise from just 3 pence to 17 pence,' says the Portman. The only disadvantage of opening a so-called 'mini' cash Isa, in which you can deposit up to \u00a33,000 during the current tax year, is that it will also restrict the amount you can invest in a stocks and shares Isa this year to \u00a33,000. Without a cash Isa, you could put up to \u00a37,000 into a 'maxi' stocks and shares Isa. For many savers with modest sums, these limits will not be a problem. If you are saving for a specific short-term objective such as the deposit on a house or a new car and cannot afford to take risks with your money, a cash Isa is a better bet anyway. Stocks &amp; shares Isas are risky investments and are only suitable for periods of five years plus. However, before you rush to open a cash Isa, check out where you can get the best rates. Some organisations are less than generous, especially with smaller savers. The Halifax, for example, pays only 4.15 per cent to Isa investors with under \u00a31,000 to invest, while Northern Ireland's First Trust Bank Isa offers a positively miserly rate of 1.25 per cent on amounts of less than \u00a32,000. At the other end of the rate scale, the internet bank Smile is offering 7.25 per cent on its cash Isa , while the Britannic and Nationwide Building Societies are paying 6.85 per cent. All these rates apply to amounts of \u00a31 or more. When comparing rates, it is also worth looking at what your local building society has to offer. Several of the smaller regional societies, such as the Coventry, the Market Harborough and the Principality, are offering some of the best rates around on their cash Isas but are restricting access to local or existing investors for fear of attracting carpetbaggers. But it is not only headline interest rates that need to be compared. Accessibility is another important feature. Although the majority of cash Isas are instant access accounts, there are many which require between 7 and 90 days' notice of withdrawals. While some are competitive, notice accounts do not necessarily pay a better return than the instant access variety. Two examples of less attractive offerings are Standard Life Bank's 50-day notice Isa which currently pays only 5.85 per cent, and Birmingham Midshires' 90-day notice account at 6 per cent. A fixed rate Isa may be worth considering if you believe interest rates may fall in the future. There are not many fixed rate accounts on offer at present, but they are available from the Julian Hodge Bank, and the Leeds &amp; Holbeck and Norwich &amp; Peterborough building societies. The best rates are offered by the Julian Hodge Bank. For terms ranging from one to five years, it is currently paying fixed rates of between 6.5 per cent and 6.85 per cent but withdrawals are not permitted until the end of the term. Naturally, if you want to maximise the tax advantages, it is better not to make withdrawals from your cash Isa unless you need the money. Once you have subscribed the maximum annual amount, no further deposits are allowed, not even to top up after withdrawals. What's more, unless the Chancellor has another change of heart as he did in the last Budget, this year could be your last chance to invest \u00a33,000. After that the annual limit is due to fall to \u00a31,000. However, the advantage of having an instant account is that it makes it easier to transfer your savings if you discover you can get a better interest rate elsewhere. You can still retain your tax advantages providing you follow the right procedures. A spokesman for Nationwide explains: 'The first thing you should do is to open a new Isa account explaining to the provider that you wish to transfer. But do not put in any fresh money otherwise you will have two cash Isas open at once which is not allowed. You can then go back to your existing provider and obtain a certificate showing how much you have subscribed and when, and also complete a transfer form. You present that certificate to your new Isa provider who will arrange the transfer from your old account.' Most Isa providers will accept incoming transfers, but not all. Abbey National, for example, does not. Spokesman Gug Kyriacou says: 'Cash Isas involve a lot of admin and we wanted to avoid Isa surfers - investors who are always moving their money around whenever a better rate is offered.' In fact, with its top rate of just 6.35 per cent, there seems little danger of this happening. Abbey National's customers may be better off transferring elsewhere, and luckily outward transfers are not restricted.",

      "body": "<p>Nearly a quarter of children now live with only one parent, most with their mothers. Back in 1972, just 7 per cent of children were living in one-parent families. </p> <p>This dramatic change in family patterns has forced financial institutions to adjust their attitude to both lone families and to women as the main carers. In particular they now concede that women are just as good credit risks as men, and are often better at budgeting. </p> <p>This does not mean that it is easy for lone parents to manage their money. Too many believe they do not have enough money even to think about financial planning. This is a mistake: you will increase the amount you have to spend if you avoid wasting money, and if you claim all the benefits you can. Financial planning is vital for lone parents. If you have an accident or fall sick, you'll have to pay someone to help with your children. If a working lone parent loses her job, she is unlikely to have someone else's income to fill the gap. </p> <p>The important areas of household finances are borrowing, insurance and pensions. </p> <p> <strong> Borrowing</strong> </p> <p> Debt is a more familiar topic to lone parents than surplus but it is worth making sure you are borrowing at the cheapest rate. If you have several loans, you may save money by amalgamating them into one cheaper loan, but do talk it through with a reliable lender and check the figures. Do not pay anyone a fee to reschedule your debts. </p> <p>Being on your own is no bar to getting a mortgage. Mark Hemingway of the Halifax explains: 'The only requirement for getting a mortgage is that you can afford the repayments.' </p> <p>If you are on the borderline of being able to afford the size of loan you need, you can improve your chances by building a track record with the lender. Prove to the lender that you have the ability to put money away each month by making regular and consistent payments into a savings scheme before you apply. Aim to create a picture of yourself as a good credit risk. But be cautious about borrowing too much, warns Hemingway: 'Don't overstretch yourself on the mortgage. We are in a low interest rate environment and interest rates could go up.' With a repayment mortgage you know for certain that the loan will be repaid on the due date. </p> <p>Choosing a fixed-rate mortgage may not be the cheapest option but you have the certainty of knowing how much your repayments will be while the interest rate is fixed. </p> <p> <strong> Life insurance</strong> </p> <p> You no longer need to buy life insurance as a condition of getting a mortgage but it is nonetheless essential when there is only one of you caring for a child. Ronnie Martin, director for protection at Legal &amp; General, says: 'With death being top of the catastrophe list, life insurance is a priority in protection planning for single parents.' </p> <p>Term insurance is the cheapest type of life insurance because you buy for a set length of time; if you survive the period, you get nothing back. You should link the term to the number of years until your children finish further education. </p> <p>Term insurance for a non-smoking 34-year-old woman for 20 years for \u00a3150,000 would cost \u00a312 a month. </p> <p>Both parents' lives should be insured. It costs money to replace the work done by the parent with day-to-day responsibility for the children, whether they earn or not. If you are receiving maintenance payments, it is crucial to insure the father's life as well because if he died, maintenance payments would stop. The father could insure his own life and have the policy written in trust for the children, which costs nothing extra. The trustees then make sure the children get the money if he dies. If he insures his own life without writing the policy in trust, he could change the beneficiaries - he may do this if he remarries. The mother can be a trustee. </p> <p>To keep more control, the mother could insure the father's life because she has a financial connection with him, known as an insurable interest. The premiums are the same either way because the policy is on the same life. But the parents have to co-operate because, as the person being insured, the father has to answer health questions. Similarly, the father could pay the premiums on the mother's life insurance. </p> <p> <strong> Health insurance</strong> </p> <p> Ill health can directly affect your income. You may work fewer hours, lose your job altogether, or need help coping with your family. Income protection insurance replaces some of your income if you become too ill to work, so you must be employed before you can buy it. It does not pay if you are made redundant, and it is more expensive for women because insurers reckon they are more likely to fall ill. </p> <p>Income protection providing \u00a31,000 a month, starting to pay after 13 weeks' delay, for a 34-year-old woman up to the age of 60, would cost \u00a357.50 a month. </p> <p>Cover is also important for the person paying maintenance. If his earnings fell, so would his ability to pay. You cannot buy this insurance to protect anyone else's income, so the father must buy it himself. </p> <p>Working or not, you can buy critical illness benefit, which provides a lump sum if you suffer one of the illnesses listed by the insurance company, such as cancer, heart attack or stroke ( see page 28 ). Again, this is more expensive for women than men. </p> <p>Buying all these insurance policies is too expensive for anyone but the rich, and the problem is deciding which you are most likely to need. That is a gamble. </p> <p> <strong> General insurance</strong> </p> <p> Buildings insurance is compulsory with a mortgage but often people on a tight budget economise by not insur ing their possessions. But the less you have, the more you need to protect it (See floods feature, page 26 ). </p> <p>Mortgage payment protection is not compulsory with mortgages, but you should have a fallback position in case your income dries up. Loan protection insurance meets your debt repayments for up to a year if you cannot work through accident, sickness or unemployment. You need separate policies for each loan. </p> <p> <strong> Pension</strong> </p> <p> You may think you can forget about pensions as a distant problem, but you should not lose an opportunity to start saving for your retirement. As with all investment, the earlier you start, the less it costs overall. </p> <p>Anyone currently going through a divorce should ensure that their spouse's pension is taken into account in the divorce settlement. It is nearly always the husband who has the bigger pension, and wives are entitled to have part of it earmarked as their income when it is paid out. For divorce petitions starting from 1 December, you will be able to claim a share of the pension fund, which means the courts can allocate you a portion of its current transfer value. If your child's father is paying into a pension scheme, find out what the benefits are and whether they come to you directly if he dies - before or after retiring. </p> <p>There is a story around at the moment, probably apocryphal, that many husbands are rushing through their divorces before the end of the year to avoid sharing their pensions. </p> <p>For your own pension, the big event is the arrival next April of stakeholder pensions which are designed mainly for people who do not have a pension, including, for the first time, people without a paid job. </p> <p>Ideally, you should not wait till next April before thinking about pensions; you should at least start putting money aside each month now. Several insurers are already selling pensions that can be switched to stakeholder later. </p> <p>You must also make wills to provide financially for your children and to establish who will look after them if you die. But wills are invalidated on marriage, so the father must make a new will if he remarries.</p> <p><strong>Struggling midwife's endowment shock </strong></p> <p>Heide Brown and her daughter, Georgia, are typical of one-parent families because for them money is always tight. Heide says: 'I always try to put something aside at the end of the month, but there is never any money left to put aside. The main culprit is childcare charges which are a nightmare, especially in the holidays.' </p> <p>She also finds that small bills mount up and cause problems: 'It is little things like the TV licence and clothes for the children.'</p> <p>She is a part-time midwife and, to keep working, has to take nursing and midwifery study days each year: 'The cost of each study day, travelling and childcare is \u00a3100. We have to finance it ourselves but without it I cannot work. That is why I get into debt. If I cannot afford it, I use my Barclaycard to get straight.'</p> <p>She already has taken a five-year loan to repay other debts and has just heard that her mortgage endowment policy has a shortfall of up to \u00a310,000. Toni Chalmers, of financial adviser Fiona Price, advises Heide to claim working families tax credit if she works more than 16 hours a week, and has savings of less than \u00a38,000. She is also eligible for the childcare tax credit to help towards the cost of childcare (see box on benefits).</p> <p>Says Toni: 'It is worth up to 70 per cent of childcare costs to a maximum of \u00a3100 a week but is allowed only if she uses a registered child minder or regulated play scheme. If she has not been claiming these allowances, it will give her extra money to help repay the loan although she may do better rescheduling or extending it.'</p> <p>On the endowment shortfall, Toni comments: 'Don't panic. Nearly everyone with with-profits endowment policies is receiving these standard letters. Some companies are offering to pay a shortfall but, if not, it is better to do something now. If you leave it another 10 years, you will have to put a massive amount away whereas now it is only a little extra.'</p> <p>Heide may be able to convert to a part-repayment and part-endowment mortgage to keep on track. If she wants to top up her investments, using an Isa avoids the charges of topping up the endowment. The snag to saving is that, once her investments exceed \u00a33,000, she starts to lose her working families tax credit.</p> <p><strong>Make sure you lay claim to those benefits </strong></p> <p>There are various benefits lone parents can claim.Even if you think you are not eligible, it is always worth applying and asking what else is available.

It does not pay if you are made redundant, and it is more expensive for women because insurers reckon they are more likely to fall ill. Income protection providing \u00a31,000 a month, starting to pay after 13 weeks' delay, for a 34-year-old woman up to the age of 60, would cost \u00a357.50 a month. Cover is also important for the person paying maintenance. If his earnings fell, so would his ability to pay. You cannot buy this insurance to protect anyone else's income, so the father must buy it himself. Working or not, you can buy critical illness benefit, which provides a lump sum if you suffer one of the illnesses listed by the insurance company, such as cancer, heart attack or stroke ( see page 28 ). Again, this is more expensive for women than men. Buying all these insurance policies is too expensive for anyone but the rich, and the problem is deciding which you are most likely to need. That is a gamble. General insurance Buildings insurance is compulsory with a mortgage but often people on a tight budget economise by not insur ing their possessions. But the less you have, the more you need to protect it (See floods feature, page 26 ). Mortgage payment protection is not compulsory with mortgages, but you should have a fallback position in case your income dries up. Loan protection insurance meets your debt repayments for up to a year if you cannot work through accident, sickness or unemployment. You need separate policies for each loan. Pension You may think you can forget about pensions as a distant problem, but you should not lose an opportunity to start saving for your retirement. As with all investment, the earlier you start, the less it costs overall. Anyone currently going through a divorce should ensure that their spouse's pension is taken into account in the divorce settlement. It is nearly always the husband who has the bigger pension, and wives are entitled to have part of it earmarked as their income when it is paid out. For divorce petitions starting from 1 December, you will be able to claim a share of the pension fund, which means the courts can allocate you a portion of its current transfer value. If your child's father is paying into a pension scheme, find out what the benefits are and whether they come to you directly if he dies - before or after retiring. There is a story around at the moment, probably apocryphal, that many husbands are rushing through their divorces before the end of the year to avoid sharing their pensions. For your own pension, the big event is the arrival next April of stakeholder pensions which are designed mainly for people who do not have a pension, including, for the first time, people without a paid job. Ideally, you should not wait till next April before thinking about pensions; you should at least start putting money aside each month now. Several insurers are already selling pensions that can be switched to stakeholder later. You must also make wills to provide financially for your children and to establish who will look after them if you die. But wills are invalidated on marriage, so the father must make a new will if he remarries. Struggling midwife's endowment shock Heide Brown and her daughter, Georgia, are typical of one-parent families because for them money is always tight. Heide says: 'I always try to put something aside at the end of the month, but there is never any money left to put aside. The main culprit is childcare charges which are a nightmare, especially in the holidays.' She also finds that small bills mount up and cause problems: 'It is little things like the TV licence and clothes for the children.' She is a part-time midwife and, to keep working, has to take nursing and midwifery study days each year: 'The cost of each study day, travelling and childcare is \u00a3100. We have to finance it ourselves but without it I cannot work. That is why I get into debt. If I cannot afford it, I use my Barclaycard to get straight.' She already has taken a five-year loan to repay other debts and has just heard that her mortgage endowment policy has a shortfall of up to \u00a310,000. Toni Chalmers, of financial adviser Fiona Price, advises Heide to claim working families tax credit if she works more than 16 hours a week, and has savings of less than \u00a38,000. She is also eligible for the childcare tax credit to help towards the cost of childcare (see box on benefits). Says Toni: 'It is worth up to 70 per cent of childcare costs to a maximum of \u00a3100 a week but is allowed only if she uses a registered child minder or regulated play scheme. If she has not been claiming these allowances, it will give her extra money to help repay the loan although she may do better rescheduling or extending it.' On the endowment shortfall, Toni comments: 'Don't panic. Nearly everyone with with-profits endowment policies is receiving these standard letters. Some companies are offering to pay a shortfall but, if not, it is better to do something now. If you leave it another 10 years, you will have to put a massive amount away whereas now it is only a little extra.' Heide may be able to convert to a part-repayment and part-endowment mortgage to keep on track. If she wants to top up her investments, using an Isa avoids the charges of topping up the endowment. The snag to saving is that, once her investments exceed \u00a33,000, she starts to lose her working families tax credit. Make sure you lay claim to those benefits There are various benefits lone parents can claim.Even if you think you are not eligible, it is always worth applying and asking what else is available. You can find more information from the relevant agencies, their websites, your library or citizens' advice bureau. Income support For people on low incomes, with savings under \u00a38,000. This includes free prescriptions, dental treatment, eye tests and travel to hospital for treatment; free school meals for your children; and help with mortgage interest if your partner is not paying up. Child benefit An amount paid for each child. Jobseeker's Allowance For those under state retirement age seeking work. Child Maintenance Bonus A one-off payment for people who receive child maintenance and lose benefits because they start work. Back to Work Bonus A one-off payment if your income support or Jobseeker's Allowance stops because you start work. Lone Parent Run-on Extra two weeks' benefit for lone parents who, by starting work, lose income support or jobseeker's allowance and possibly housing benefit and council tax benefit. \u0095 Contact for all of the above benefits: Benefits Agency. Housing benefit This pays your rent. You can claim four weeks' extended housing benefit if you lose income support because you start work. \u0095 Contact: Your local authority. Council tax benefit The only adult in your home? You can claim the Single Adult Discount of 25 per cent, and four weeks' extended Council Tax benefit if you lose income support by starting work. \u0095 Contact: Your Council Tax department. Working Families Tax Credit For those working more than 16 hours a week, with savings under \u00a38,000: add together personal allowances, extra for working more than 30 hours a week, and 70 per cent of childcare costs for the maximum credit. For childcare tax credit, you must use a registered minder, nursery, play scheme or club. Disabled Persons Tax Credit Includes childcare tax credit towards cost of childcare. \u0095 Contact for tax credits: Inland Revenue. Jobfinder's grant A \u00a3200 grant for people registered with New Deal for Lone Parents returning to work. It is not taxable. \u0095 Contact: Employment Service",

Alternatively you can open separate mini Isas for each component. Inheritance tax - Tax charged against your estate when you die. The first \u00a3234,000 of your estate is free from inheritance tax; any amount above this will be taxed at 40 per cent. National Savings - Deposit based investments issued on behalf of the Government. Non-taxpayer - A person whose taxable earnings are exceeded by tax allowances. Personal equity plan (Pep) - A tax-efficient savings plan, withdrawn from sale in April last year. Peps set up before that date can continue running indefinitely until the investor withdraws his or her money or dies. Personal pension - A private pension scheme sold by insurance companies to people who are unable to, or who have chosen not to, join an occupational pension scheme. Stakeholder pension - A new type of pension scheme which will go on sale from 6 April next year. To qualify as a stakeholder, a pension scheme must be flexible and have low charges - no initial charge and annual charges of 1 per cent or less a year. Starting rate taxpayer - A person who pays a top income tax rate of 10 per cent. Taxable gain - The gain that is left after you have taken all your allowances into account. Taxable income - Income that has been paid without the deduction of tax, but which is liable for tax unless you have allowances which can be set against it. Tax Exempt Special Savings Account (Tessa) - A tax-efficient deposit account, withdrawn from sale in April 1999. Tessas mature after five years, so many people still have accounts earning them tax-free interest. Tax year - Runs from 6 April to 5 April. Tessa-only Isa - An Isa that can accept up to \u00a39,000 in capital (but not interest) from a maturing Tessa. Venture capital trusts - A savings scheme with generous tax advantages designed to encourage investment in small unlisted companies.",

      "body": "<p>You could be forgiven for thinking that the offices of the Financial Ombudsman Service would be traditional, conformist and dull. When you collect together 400 workers who specialise in handling complaints about pension sales and other financial transactions, you probably do not expect the emphasis to be on brightness, vivacity, fun and individuality. But, in fact, the ombudsman's offices at South Quay Plaza, near Canary Wharf in east London, are lively, colourful and stimulating. </p> <p>It is not that the FOS is run by wild party animals. It is more that organisations are starting to realise that human beings tend to work better when they can express some individuality through their surroundings. Put a team in an office with grey walls and little natural light and they will probably be less happy (and less effective) than another team which has colour, big windows and attractive views. The FOS development is a good example of what the modern workplace will look like; it is an example which is likely to be followed in hundreds of others offices and buildings over the next few years. </p> <p>The move to South Quay Plaza came about after the Government decreed that eight different financial services sector ombudsman schemes should be merged. Its office building was therefore going to be important not just as a place to house the staff but as the environment where eight different cultures would meld into one. Under a more traditional approach - where office managers design floor layouts with little thought as to how staff meet and communicate - the different teams could have been thrown together without ever really getting to know each other. </p> <p>The FOS has, in fact, tried throwing the odd staff party so that teams could meet, and publishing friendly newsletters, but the best results have been achieved through the physical layout. Office designer DEGW deliberately groups the communal facilities together - photocopier, fax machines, coffee dispenser and toilets - so that staff can amble round these different points and talk to each other. Most people find it easier to ask an unknown colleague 'How does this fax work?' than to say 'May I join you?' to a stranger at a party. </p> <p>The office design was worked out in consultation with a group of 30 employees. DEGW nearly always uses this method and finds that it produces sensible but lively results. 'You sometimes get disruptive people,' says spokeswoman Beth Morgan 'but usually the group can deal with it. If not, we'll arrange a one-to-one meeting and that nearly always sorts the problem. Often a problem lies with other issues like they've seen this sort of thing before and it hasn't worked out.' </p> <p>People's desire for originality seems to be more deep-rooted than most office designers and managers have ever appreciated. A very traditional company in the oil and gas sector has, by the same route, designed rather an outlandish (though still functional) structure which includes relaxation areas resembling tree houses and a video lounge with a range of audio-visual facilities. 'Their overriding priority was to stimulate fun and creativity,' says Morgan. The development of a 'fun' atmosphere is now a common requirement, particularly in the dotcom sector, and is generally seen as a fast route to promoting creativity. </p> <p>In the Egg call centre in Derby and the Capital One call centre in Nottingham, the managers face the constant challenge of retaining staff. Competition from other employers and the stress of hitting customer-handling targets lead to high turnover rates at call centres generally. But both these organisations have improved staff retention by paying great attention to office design. They let their staff work in small teams, giving them a set amount of money each week to spend on whatever they want, from tenpin bowling to buying a coffee maker. A lot of the money goes on decorating their part of the office. </p> <p>More new offices will - like the FOS - be open-plan, but open-plan with a difference. No one in this part of South Quay Plaza has their own office or any piece of furniture which denotes authority. Walter Merricks, the Ombudsman, says: 'We wanted to send out a message that there wouldn't be privileged people around with thick pile carpets and drinks cabinets. There has to be a management hierarchy, but it doesn't have to express itself in this way.' </p> <p>Quite right, says DEGW. Many egalitarian and team-working ideas behind open-plan offices are corrupted if the top dogs decide to retain their own offices or other physical manifestations of power. </p> <p>The FSO offices have three differently coloured floors - mustard, loganberry and fuchsia. But the colour schemes, occasional soft sofas and other signs of informality have not produced the bad effects that traditionalists might fear. In fact, the comfort seems to have improved communications - useful for an organisation in the complaints-handling and communications business.</p>",

The FOS has, in fact, tried throwing the odd staff party so that teams could meet, and publishing friendly newsletters, but the best results have been achieved through the physical layout. Office designer DEGW deliberately groups the communal facilities together - photocopier, fax machines, coffee dispenser and toilets - so that staff can amble round these different points and talk to each other. Most people find it easier to ask an unknown colleague 'How does this fax work?' than to say 'May I join you?' to a stranger at a party. The office design was worked out in consultation with a group of 30 employees. DEGW nearly always uses this method and finds that it produces sensible but lively results. 'You sometimes get disruptive people,' says spokeswoman Beth Morgan 'but usually the group can deal with it. If not, we'll arrange a one-to-one meeting and that nearly always sorts the problem. Often a problem lies with other issues like they've seen this sort of thing before and it hasn't worked out.' People's desire for originality seems to be more deep-rooted than most office designers and managers have ever appreciated. A very traditional company in the oil and gas sector has, by the same route, designed rather an outlandish (though still functional) structure which includes relaxation areas resembling tree houses and a video lounge with a range of audio-visual facilities. 'Their overriding priority was to stimulate fun and creativity,' says Morgan. The development of a 'fun' atmosphere is now a common requirement, particularly in the dotcom sector, and is generally seen as a fast route to promoting creativity. In the Egg call centre in Derby and the Capital One call centre in Nottingham, the managers face the constant challenge of retaining staff. Competition from other employers and the stress of hitting customer-handling targets lead to high turnover rates at call centres generally. But both these organisations have improved staff retention by paying great attention to office design. They let their staff work in small teams, giving them a set amount of money each week to spend on whatever they want, from tenpin bowling to buying a coffee maker. A lot of the money goes on decorating their part of the office. More new offices will - like the FOS - be open-plan, but open-plan with a difference. No one in this part of South Quay Plaza has their own office or any piece of furniture which denotes authority. Walter Merricks, the Ombudsman, says: 'We wanted to send out a message that there wouldn't be privileged people around with thick pile carpets and drinks cabinets. There has to be a management hierarchy, but it doesn't have to express itself in this way.' Quite right, says DEGW. Many egalitarian and team-working ideas behind open-plan offices are corrupted if the top dogs decide to retain their own offices or other physical manifestations of power. The FSO offices have three differently coloured floors - mustard, loganberry and fuchsia. But the colour schemes, occasional soft sofas and other signs of informality have not produced the bad effects that traditionalists might fear. In fact, the comfort seems to have improved communications - useful for an organisation in the complaints-handling and communications business.",

But it must never be forgotten that there can be also the opposite: negative job satisfaction, the powerful buzz, pleasure and stimulus that comes from fighting or causing trouble for a boss who is neither respected nor liked. Keeping people happy by ensuring that their jobs are comfortable, fulfilling and rewarding is not a new management concept, but it is more important than ever, when the price of not doing so so can be the destruction of the company. The best 'people' management tends to come from experience and to be based on mutual respect and understanding. Unfortunately, many of the new e-commerce companies do not have this experience. They will have to learn fast.",

      "body": "<p>Contrary to popular belief, you cannot avoid tax on your savings just by investing them offshore. Some UK investors may gain a tax advantage by using offshore investment bonds to defer tax but those who stand to benefit most from offshore investment are 'expats' or 'non-domiciled' foreign nationals living in the UK. Moira Elms, of accountants Pricewaterhouse Coopers, says: 'People assume that because the interest on offshore savings accounts is paid without tax deducted, it is tax-free. They do not realise that the interest is reportable on UK tax returns.' </p> <p>Savers who use an offshore bank or building society may gain a marginal tax flow advantage because of the delay between receiving interest and having to fork out the tax. There can also be an attraction if interest rates offshore are higher because this would mean that the net returns would be better. But at present the reverse is the case. For example, the best rate Nationwide is offering through its Isle of Man offshore subsidiary is 6.3 per cent and to get that return you need to have \u00a3250,000 invested with three months' notice for withdrawals. By contrast, onshore investors with access to the internet can earn 7 per cent from Nationwide's e-Savings account with deposits of as little as \u00a31 and have instant access to their money. </p> <p>UK investors who have kept quiet about offshore savings could soon face discovery. Greater co-operation is likely between the Inland Revenue and offshore locations such as the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man following a report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on tax havens. The report criticised the tax regimes of 35 countries, including the three Crown dependencies, which it said harmed trade and investment. There is already some co-operation with the UK tax authorities. Nigel Smith, of Royal &amp; Sun Alliance International Finance Services based in the Isle of Man, says: 'Since last July we have had to report to the Inland Revenue if an investment bond worth more than \u00a356,800 is surrendered where we believe the investor is a UK resident.' </p> <p>Offshore investment bonds sold by insurance companies are a quite legitimate way in which UK citizens can defer and potentially reduce their tax bills. No tax is levied on the investment income and capital gains within the bonds while they are in force so investors can benefit from the tax-free roll-up of returns. No tax is payable by investors either as long as their money remains in the bonds but a tax liability does arise when the bond is cashed and the money brought back into the UK. </p> <p>However, a saving can still be made because it enables higher rate tax payers to put off paying any tax until they are subject to a lower rate, such as after retirement. UK investors who want an income can also withdraw 5 per cent a year from their bonds without incurring any immediate liability to tax. </p> <p>For UK citizens who are living or working abroad and not paying UK tax, offshore savings accounts and investments in the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man can be attractive both from a tax point of view and because of the familiarity of the institutions and their proximity to the UK. Anybody who has come from abroad to live or work here could consider putting their investments offshore in order to avoid incurring UK Inheritance Tax on them. Although once someone has been in the UK for 17 out of the last 20 years they are regarded as domiciled here, any assets that have been placed in a trust offshore before that time can be deemed 'excluded property'.</p>",

They do not realise that the interest is reportable on UK tax returns.' Savers who use an offshore bank or building society may gain a marginal tax flow advantage because of the delay between receiving interest and having to fork out the tax. There can also be an attraction if interest rates offshore are higher because this would mean that the net returns would be better. But at present the reverse is the case. For example, the best rate Nationwide is offering through its Isle of Man offshore subsidiary is 6.3 per cent and to get that return you need to have \u00a3250,000 invested with three months' notice for withdrawals. By contrast, onshore investors with access to the internet can earn 7 per cent from Nationwide's e-Savings account with deposits of as little as \u00a31 and have instant access to their money. UK investors who have kept quiet about offshore savings could soon face discovery. Greater co-operation is likely between the Inland Revenue and offshore locations such as the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man following a report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on tax havens. The report criticised the tax regimes of 35 countries, including the three Crown dependencies, which it said harmed trade and investment. There is already some co-operation with the UK tax authorities. Nigel Smith, of Royal &amp; Sun Alliance International Finance Services based in the Isle of Man, says: 'Since last July we have had to report to the Inland Revenue if an investment bond worth more than \u00a356,800 is surrendered where we believe the investor is a UK resident.' Offshore investment bonds sold by insurance companies are a quite legitimate way in which UK citizens can defer and potentially reduce their tax bills. No tax is levied on the investment income and capital gains within the bonds while they are in force so investors can benefit from the tax-free roll-up of returns. No tax is payable by investors either as long as their money remains in the bonds but a tax liability does arise when the bond is cashed and the money brought back into the UK. However, a saving can still be made because it enables higher rate tax payers to put off paying any tax until they are subject to a lower rate, such as after retirement. UK investors who want an income can also withdraw 5 per cent a year from their bonds without incurring any immediate liability to tax. For UK citizens who are living or working abroad and not paying UK tax, offshore savings accounts and investments in the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man can be attractive both from a tax point of view and because of the familiarity of the institutions and their proximity to the UK. Anybody who has come from abroad to live or work here could consider putting their investments offshore in order to avoid incurring UK Inheritance Tax on them. Although once someone has been in the UK for 17 out of the last 20 years they are regarded as domiciled here, any assets that have been placed in a trust offshore before that time can be deemed 'excluded property'.",

Unless you are made of money, you will probably be rather taken aback at the cost, which could easily be \u00a350 a month, depending on your circumstances. But some of the arguments in its favour sound persuasive - certainly persuasive enough to encourage 780,000 people to start paying for this cover in 1999, according to insurer Swiss Re. </p> <p>You could well be quoted horrible statistics. 'One in four men will suffer a critical illness by the time they reach pension age,' says Peter Kelly of Allied Dunbar, which last week announced a tie-up with charity Imperial Cancer Research on its critical illness cover. 'One in five women will suffer a critical illness. That could be a heart attack, for instance, cancer or a stroke.' He adds that a 40-year-old man is 2.5 times more likely to suffer one of these serious medical conditions than he is to die. </p> <p>Researchers are also increasingly detecting a link between excessive working hours and critical illnesses. Basing their argument on this sort of data, many financial advisers are promoting critical illness cover just as heavily as life cover. Kevin Morgan, medical cover specialist at financial adviser Litecastle, says: 'Single people or young couples probably have little need for life assurance. But there is now a great deal more interest in critical illness cover than life cover. People are surviving illnesses that even a generation ago would have killed. And if you buy critical illness cover, you get the benefit of it yourself - unlike life cover.' </p> <p>The insurance entitles you to a tax-free lump sum payout on the diagnosis of one of these nasties. So if you suffer a stroke, for instance, you could spend the money on adapting your home so you can live there more easily. An industry-wide agreement, unveiled last year, has introduced standard terms and definitions, making it easier for people to know what they are buying and their position if they need to claim. You can spend the money from a claim on whatever you want. One Allied Dunbar customer who suffered a brain tumour spent some of his cash on a fitted kitchen and also set part of it aside to cover future tax bills. But since the vast majority of buyers take it when they get a new mortgage, most policyholders seem to want it to pay off their mortgage and other financial commitments. </p> <p>Against this kind of argument, however, you could say that people who look after themselves well are less likely to suffer from these conditions. 'Smoking causes almost one in five coronary heart disease deaths,' explains the British Heart Foundation on its website. 'If you are under 50 and smoke, your risk of heart attack is up to ten times that of a non-smoker.' </p> <p>And if you keep your salt intake down, do not get overweight, eat your fruit and vegetables, drink sensibly and take exercise, you are less likely to be one of the 300,000 people a year who suffer a heart attack (of whom about half survive). </p> <p>It is also impossible to predict the future incidence of these conditions. About 100,000 people a year have a first stroke, according to the Stroke Association. Survival rates could increase substantially, according to its research, if, for instance, the Government sets up more Stroke Units, teams which can provide specialist emergency and rehabilitation treatment. Similarly, your likelihood of getting a heart attack could be reduced if, for example, more money is put into prevention, screening and earlier diagnosis. </p> <p>However, it has to be said that more of us could suffer these illnesses as medical and pharmaceutical treatment improves, and our life expectancy increases. In a 1998 report for the Stroke Association, Professor Nick Bosanquet of Imperial College concluded: 'Numbers of patients with strokes needing longer-term support are increasing. We are achieving health promotion targets in reducing immediate mortality from stroke, but there is a new challenge of longer-term disability.' </p> <p>Thinking about these risks, you may conclude that you would buy the insurance if you could easily afford it. But, as Charles Levett-Scrivener of financial adviser Towry Law says, the premiums can be quite substantial: 'The people who really need critical illness cover are parents and other people with dependents. But parents don't have a great deal of spare income, and they have other insurances to deal with, life cover and saving for retirement.' </p> <p>On top of this, critical illness is a new kind of product - developed only in 1986 in South Africa by Dr Marius Barnard, brother of heart transplant pioneer Christian. This means that insurers have only 14 years of experience on claims. It could be that some of them have been over-cautious and have charged more than they needed to. Morgan, however, estimates that premiums have come down by about 10 per cent in the past year - 'mostly because of competition'. </p> <p>Customers are also often given a better deal if they buy a critical illness policy on top of another product. Most sales used to be on the back of mortgage endowment policies, but since far fewer of these are now being sold, insurers are increasingly selling them in conjunction with more straightforward 'term' and 'whole of life' insurance policies. For instance, a 45-year old non-smoking woman paying for cover of \u00a3100,000 from Allied Dunbar would pay \u00a357 a month for a combined critical illness and term assurance plan. If she bought the two products separately, she would pay 30 per cent more. </p> <p>But you may still decide that the premiums are just too expensive. After all, as the Allied Dunbar statistics imply, the majority of people, at least 75 per cent of them, look unlikely to contract one of these illnesses until after pension age. </p> <p>By that time, they have probably paid off their mortgage and have fewer financial commitments. And if you had put the money you could have spent on premiums into a pension, you could have a tidy sum awaiting you. </p> <p>Even if you did contract something unpleasant, you would have that extra pension money to draw on. You could have accumulated \u00a360,000 by investing \u00a350 a month over the past 20 years in a with-profits pension plan, according to Your Pension magazine.</p> <p><strong>Young, free and... healthy </strong></p> <p>'Young people need to think about critical illness cover because so many of them own their own homes,' says a spokeswoman for Scottish Mutual, one of the market leaders. Insurers and financial advisers are very eager to sell these policies to the young. But are the young pouring their premiums down the drain? </p> <p>By and large, the medical statistics suggest the common-sense conclusion most of us would come to: your risk of contracting a critical illness grows as you get older. About 41 per cent of NHS hospital treatment is for people aged over 65. Research from the Stroke Association indicates that only 10 per cent of the people who suffer a first stroke each year in England and Wales are under 55. The incidence of heart attacks follows increasing age, according to the British Heart Foundation. Only 13 per cent of male heart attack sufferers are below 65 (7 per cent of female sufferers).</p> <p>Of course, not all illnesses show this correlation.

Amazingly, M&amp;S used to stock its stores according to their size, so Blackpool and Guildford would have exactly the same ranges.

      "bodyText": "Thousands of South American indians were infected with measles, killing hundreds, in order to for US scientists to study the effects on primitive societies of natural selection, according to a book out next month. The astonishing story of genetic research on humans, which took 10 years to uncover, is likely to shake the world of anthropology to its core, according to Professor Terry Turner of Cornell University, who has read the proofs. \"In its scale, ramifications, and sheer criminality and corruption it is unparalleled in the history of anthropology,\" Prof Turner says in a warning letter to Louise Lamphere, the president of the American Anthropology Association (AAA). The book accuses James Neel, the geneticist who headed a long-term project to study the Yanomami people of Venezuela in the mid-60s, of using a virulent measles vaccine to spark off an epidemic which killed hundreds and probably thousands. Once the epidemic was under way, according to the book, the research team \"refused to provide any medical assistance to the sick and dying Yanomami, on explicit order from Neel. He insisted to his colleagues that they were only there to observe and record the epidemic, and that they must stick strictly to their roles as scientists, not provide medical help\". The book, Darkness in El Dorado by the investigative journalist Patrick Tierney, is due to be published on October 1. Prof Turner, whose letter was co-signed by fellow anthropologist Leslie Sponsel of the University of Hawaii, was trying to warn the AAA of the impending scandal so the profession could defend itself. Although Neel died last February, many of his associates, some of them authors of classic anthropology texts, are still alive. The accusations will be the main focus of the AAA's AGM in November, when the surviving scientists have been invited to defend their work. None have commented publicly, but they are asking colleagues to come to their defence. One of the most controversial aspects of the research which allegedly culminated in the epidemic is that it was funded by the US atomic energy commission, which was anxious to discover what might happen to communities when large numbers were wiped out by nuclear war. While there is no \"smoking gun\" in the form of texts or recorded speeches by Neel explaining his conduct, Prof Turner believes the only explanation is that he was trying to test controversial eugenic theories like the Nazi scientist Josef Mengele. He quotes another anthropologist who read the manuscript as saying: \"Mr. Tierney's analysis is a case study of the dangers in science of the uncontrolled ego, of lack of respect for life, and of greed and self-indulgence. It is a further extraordinary revelation of malicious and perverted work conducted under the aegis of the atomic energy commission.\" Prof Turner says Neel and his group used a virulent vaccine called Edmonson B on the Yanomani, which was known to produce symptoms virtually indistinguishable from cases of measles. \"Medical experts, when informed that Neel and his group used the vaccine in question on the Yanomami, typically refuse to believe it at first, then say that it is incredible that they could have done it, and are at a loss to explain why they would have chosen such an inappropriate and dangerous vaccine,\" he writes. \"There is no record that Neel sought any medical advice before applying the vaccine. He never informed the appropriate organs of the Venezuelan government that his group was planning to carry out a vaccination campaign, as he was legally required to do. Fatalities \"Neither he nor any other member of the expedition has ever explained why that vaccine was used, despite the evidence that it actually caused or, at a minimum, greatly exacerbated the fatal epidemic.\" Prof Turner says that Neel held the view that \"natural\" human society, as seen before the advent of large-scale agriculture, consists of small, genetically isolated groups in which dominant genes - specifically a gene he believed existed for \"leadership\" or \"innate ability\" - have a selective advantage. In such an environment, male carriers of this gene would gain access to a disproportionate number of females, reproducing their genes more frequently than less \"innately able\" males. The result would supposedly be a continual upgrading of the human genetic stock. He says Neel believed that in modern societies \"superior leadership genes would be swamped by mass genetic mediocrity\". \"The political implication of this fascistic eugenics is clearly that society should be reorganised into small breeding isolates in which genetically superior males could emerge into dominance, eliminating or subordinating the male losers in the competition for leadership and women, and amassing harems of brood females.\" Prof Turner adds. In the memo he says: \"One of Tierney's more startling revelations is that the whole Yanomami project was an outgrowth and continuation of the atomic energy commission's secret programme of experiments on human subjects. \"Neel, the originator of the project, was part of the medical and genetic research team attached to the atomic energy commission since the days of the Manhattan Project.\" James Neel was well-known for his research into the effects of radiation on human subjects and personally headed the team that investigated the effects of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs on survivors and their children.

      "body": "<p>Robinson Crusoe was exceedingly glad to see us. So glad, in fact, that he actually licked my hand. It had been a week since he last saw human life and, as we unpacked the freshly-caught lobster for a barbecue on the beach, he stood watching from a polite distance, his tongue hanging out, drooling. </p> <p>Robinson is the self-appointed guardian of Ile aux Chats, a tiny island an hour or so by boat from Rodrigues, which is itself an only slightly less tiny island 550km east of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. </p> <p>Robinson is a dog. Five years ago, two men were sent to watch over some rare birds on Ile aux Chats, and one took him along. When the birds flew off, the men returned to Rodrigues with Robinson, who promptly disappeared - his whereabouts remaining a mystery until some fishermen sighted a mustard-coloured mongrel paddling in the direction of Ile aux Chats. He's been there ever since, living off flying fish and scraps left by tourists who come to eat, snorkel and bake their brains on the crescent of perfect white sand along its eastern shore. </p> <p>In the four days I spent in and around the beautifully-stark volcanic island of Rodrigues, Robinson was the only creature I met who seemed to have any desire to leave the place long-term. About the size of Jersey and home to 37,000 Creoles, the entire island has just three taxis, one petrol station and a prison which rarely has anyone in it, possibly because there's so little crime, and possibly because, in the absence of any fence or locked door, detainees can simply stroll out. </p> <p>I was staying on the south east coast, at the Mourouk Ebony, one of the island's four hotels, comprising a neat row of red-roofed bungalows half-concealed by trees and flowers and overlooking part of Rodrigues's most astonishing feature: the giant coral reef that encircles the entire island. </p> <p>Find a nice spot and you could look at it all day: at the translucent emerald shallows stretching 2km out to the barrier where breakers 3m high separate the lagoon from the wilder reaches of the Indian Ocean. Get up at 5am and you'll see women wading waist-high through the waters halfway between the shore and the breakers, spears held aloft to catch octopus they can't afford to eat. </p> <p>\"Why don't men do it?\" I asked Josie, the Mourouk guide. \"Because in the afternoons they have to drink rum,\" he said. </p> <p>This unique marine environment, 240km square of reef flats surrounding just 108km square of land, is what encouraged Britain's Royal Geographic Society to fund marine research here, since so little is known about the Rodriguan eco-system other than that it is desperately fragile and that its waters, a crucial economic resource, have already been heavily exploited. </p> <p>Named the Shoals of Capricorn, the scheme - which runs outreach classes for 200 eager Rodriguan schoolkids - currently boasts one famous Briton among its volunteer researchers: Prince William, there for a month during his gap year. I saw him having lunch on the Mourouk terrace as I checked in, but not before his bodyguard saw me first and requested a quiet word outside. </p> <p>Allowed to stay, I parked myself at the next table and, feeling a little disappointed at being perceived as no threat whatsoever to the monarchy, swotted up on the history of this sun-baked, cyclone-prone island reputedly discovered in 1528 by a Portuguese seafarer called Diego Rodrigues whose name it kept throughout rule by Dutch, French and British colonisation until becoming part of Mauritius in 1968. </p> <p>Today, the export to Mauritius of livestock, maize and onions (the latter they buy back when needed, at a loss, since they have no method of storage after harvest) are the chief sources of income, along with fishing; while the big political issues of the day are unemployment, roads and the water supply. In some villages on the barren, rocky stretch along the southwest, water is only available once a week, from just one tap. </p> <p>But, although some islanders have mixed feelings about it, tourism is starting to make a difference to the economy. Rodrigues's remoteness, its raw beauty and giant blazing sunsets that seem capable of filling 10 skies have made the island a haven for honeymooners and couples celebrating anniversaries, while the racing winds and rich marine life have turned the lagoon into one big playground for windsurfers and divers. And back on dry land, the rollercoaster roads - with their chasm-like potholes, steep inclines and tethered beasts lurking around every sharp bend - make for exhilarating mountain-biking. </p> <p>For all that, though, I had my best times on excursions that centred more on the culture, history and way of life of Rodriguans. There was the 600m underground trek through the stalacmites and stalactites of Caverne Patate, where you can see the remains of a solitaire embedded in rock. And don't go confusing solitaires with dodos, which were from Mauritius. Solitaires were bigger birds, explains Josie, had longer necks and cried tears when caught - not that that saved them from the hungry early settlers, who soon ate them into extinction. </p> <p>Further inland, where the vegetation becomes more lush, Saint Gabriel church - the biggest place of worship in the entire Indian Ocean with a capacity for 2,000 souls every Sunday - is worth a visit, if only to shake your head in wonder at the fact that the 22,000 coral bricks used in its construction in 1937 were all carried up from the coast by women. They also carried up the sand and the bell - and probably the men's rum, too. </p> <p>For the most spectacular views of the island, take the road from St Gabriel church up to nearby Mont Limon which, at 398m, is Rodrigues's highest peak. From there, you can look down on the undulating valleys sweeping down to the shores, and take in the sheer scale of the vast lagoon. Those waters offer some of the best underwater experiences in the entire Indian Ocean and you don't have to be a qualified scuba diver to make the most of them - you can still see a stunning array of marine life in just snorkel and flippers. Halfway to the Ile aux Chats, we stopped the boat and everyone jumped into the clear waters for snorkelling among shoals of barracuda and countless other finned exotica. </p> <p>If you can dive, however, there are white-tipped reef sharks at Grand Bassin, and a good number of shipwrecks are scattered throughout the reef. Go with a good skipper, though, or your craft could end up joining them on the lagoon bed. </p> <p>I also managed to catch a sega tambour, the traditional dance in which men and women shuffle back and forth like high-speed ducks to percussion and accordion music (one version of it is called scottisches). </p> <p> Other things to see and do include visiting Ile aux Cocos, even more idyllic than Ile aux Chats, dining with a local family (a popular practice for foodie tourists), sampling the island's Ebony nightclub (sega and techno), or seeing the markets in Port Mathurin, the main town, on a Saturday. </p> <p>On my final afternoon, I took a walk along the rocky coast from Pointe Coton in the northeast to Trou d'Argent, the island's most famous beach. In that short trek, I must have passed four or five other world-class beaches, pristine and deserted save for the odd dog, hen or goat dallying in the trees. It was breathtaking. At one point, the reef came in close and the fine spray doused my sunburnt skin. Then I saw a rainbow. What next, I wondered. When I got to Trou d'Argent I half-expected to find God there, sitting on a towel, gazing out at the breakers and looking awfully pleased with himself. </p> <p>As I headed back, the sun was setting behind the trees, casting long shadows across the virgin sands. Can Rodrigues stay like this? Probably not. There are already plans to expand the airport and, depending on who you talk to, there are six, nine, maybe even 16 new hotels planned. How on earth will this tiny island sustain development on such a scale? Where will the water come from, the power, the waste disposal, the fresh fruit, veg and varieties of fish tourists would expect? And, most important, will it be the locals who benefit, and can their culture still thrive? No one can say for sure. </p> <p>In the morning the shuttle to the airport seemed to leave ridiculously early but it soon became clear why. The driver picked up every single person on the road: schoolkids with neat little satchels, men carrying packed lunches, women picking their way up hills with giant loads on their heads. </p> <p>\"We're 10 minutes ahead of schedule,\" said the pilot as the 48-seater plane taxied along the runway, \"so we'll just take off now and do a quick tour of the island before heading for Mauritius.\" </p> <p>I looked down at the glistening lagoon below and at all the places I'd managed to get to - and all those I hadn't. Ah well, en lotte foi - the Creole expression meaning \"next time\". </p> <p> <strong>And if you want more R&amp;R on the way home ... </strong><br></p> <p>By way of a complete contrast, on the leg back I spent two nights on Mauritius, in the Prince Maurice, a luxurious new five-star hotel about the size of a small country. It's the kind of place you arrive at - having journeyed from the airport past countless fields of cane, tobacco and tea, while swerving to avoid the occasional chicken - and don't leave until it's time to get back on the plane. </p> <p>Boasting floating restaurants, a health centre, four bars (the Fitness Bar serves \"vitamin cocktails\"), sunset cruises, a golf course at its sister hotel and a private beach with watersports facilities, the Maurice is a full-on pamperfest whether you need it or not.</p> <p>You just have to reach towards your bottle of water in the restaurant and a young boy in a starched white outfit will appear at your side to pour it, bow, then vanish. And if you're catching a few rays on the beach, you don't even have to get up to attract a waiter's attention - just lift a little flag and he'll come running.</p> <p>In the evening I'd return to my room to find the covers of my bed had been neatly turned down and a \"thought\" left on top, printed on a square sheet of red paper. \"Never read a book that's less than a year old,\" mine said. I meant to ask why, but somehow I just never got round to it.</p> <p> <strong>The practicals</strong><br></p> <p>Andrew Gilchrist travelled to Rodrigues with Air Mauritius (020-7434 4375) and Rainbow Tours (020-7226 1004, <a href=\"mailto:info@rainbowtours.co.uk\">info@rainbowtours.co.uk</a>).</p> <p>Eight nights' half-board at the Mourouk costs from \u00a3995, including return flights to Mauritius and onward flights to Rodrigues. A 15-night holiday combining seven nights' half-board on Rodrigues and six nights' B&amp;B at the new five-star Le Prince Maurice from \u00a31,925 per person based on two sharing. </p> <p>Air Mauritius operates four direct flights a week between the UK and Mauritius (journey time: 11hrs 45mins) and a daily service between Mauritius and Rodrigues (journey time: 1 hour). You can find out more about Rodrigues at the <a href=\"http://www.rgs.org\"> Royal Geographic Society</a> website. </p>",

I also managed to catch a sega tambour, the traditional dance in which men and women shuffle back and forth like high-speed ducks to percussion and accordion music (one version of it is called scottisches). Other things to see and do include visiting Ile aux Cocos, even more idyllic than Ile aux Chats, dining with a local family (a popular practice for foodie tourists), sampling the island's Ebony nightclub (sega and techno), or seeing the markets in Port Mathurin, the main town, on a Saturday. On my final afternoon, I took a walk along the rocky coast from Pointe Coton in the northeast to Trou d'Argent, the island's most famous beach. In that short trek, I must have passed four or five other world-class beaches, pristine and deserted save for the odd dog, hen or goat dallying in the trees. It was breathtaking. At one point, the reef came in close and the fine spray doused my sunburnt skin. Then I saw a rainbow. What next, I wondered. When I got to Trou d'Argent I half-expected to find God there, sitting on a towel, gazing out at the breakers and looking awfully pleased with himself. As I headed back, the sun was setting behind the trees, casting long shadows across the virgin sands. Can Rodrigues stay like this? Probably not. There are already plans to expand the airport and, depending on who you talk to, there are six, nine, maybe even 16 new hotels planned. How on earth will this tiny island sustain development on such a scale? Where will the water come from, the power, the waste disposal, the fresh fruit, veg and varieties of fish tourists would expect? And, most important, will it be the locals who benefit, and can their culture still thrive? No one can say for sure. In the morning the shuttle to the airport seemed to leave ridiculously early but it soon became clear why. The driver picked up every single person on the road: schoolkids with neat little satchels, men carrying packed lunches, women picking their way up hills with giant loads on their heads. \"We're 10 minutes ahead of schedule,\" said the pilot as the 48-seater plane taxied along the runway, \"so we'll just take off now and do a quick tour of the island before heading for Mauritius.\" I looked down at the glistening lagoon below and at all the places I'd managed to get to - and all those I hadn't. Ah well, en lotte foi - the Creole expression meaning \"next time\". And if you want more R&amp;R on the way home ... By way of a complete contrast, on the leg back I spent two nights on Mauritius, in the Prince Maurice, a luxurious new five-star hotel about the size of a small country. It's the kind of place you arrive at - having journeyed from the airport past countless fields of cane, tobacco and tea, while swerving to avoid the occasional chicken - and don't leave until it's time to get back on the plane. Boasting floating restaurants, a health centre, four bars (the Fitness Bar serves \"vitamin cocktails\"), sunset cruises, a golf course at its sister hotel and a private beach with watersports facilities, the Maurice is a full-on pamperfest whether you need it or not. You just have to reach towards your bottle of water in the restaurant and a young boy in a starched white outfit will appear at your side to pour it, bow, then vanish. And if you're catching a few rays on the beach, you don't even have to get up to attract a waiter's attention - just lift a little flag and he'll come running. In the evening I'd return to my room to find the covers of my bed had been neatly turned down and a \"thought\" left on top, printed on a square sheet of red paper. \"Never read a book that's less than a year old,\" mine said. I meant to ask why, but somehow I just never got round to it. The practicals Andrew Gilchrist travelled to Rodrigues with Air Mauritius (020-7434 4375) and Rainbow Tours (020-7226 1004, info@rainbowtours.co.uk). Eight nights' half-board at the Mourouk costs from \u00a3995, including return flights to Mauritius and onward flights to Rodrigues. A 15-night holiday combining seven nights' half-board on Rodrigues and six nights' B&amp;B at the new five-star Le Prince Maurice from \u00a31,925 per person based on two sharing. Air Mauritius operates four direct flights a week between the UK and Mauritius (journey time: 11hrs 45mins) and a daily service between Mauritius and Rodrigues (journey time: 1 hour).

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Multibillion pound programmes to revive inner cities and create work in depressed regions and coalfield communities face being vetoed by Brussels because they breach EU rules on state aid. </p> <p>Anxious Labour MPs have joined builders and developers to warn that thousands of jobs are at risk with a cloud hanging over hundreds of urban regeneration and job creation initiatives. </p> <p>In a hard hitting report, the Commons environment committee has warned that meddling by Brussels will have \"severe consequences\" for the deputy prime minister John Prescott's vision of an urban renaissance, which is tied to the regeneration of brownfield sites. Mr Prescott has set a target of building 60% of new homes on such sites. </p> <p>Fuelling the debate about Britain's relationship with the EU, the environment committee says that \"illogical and ill-considered\" rulings from Brussels are bringing the EU into disrepute. </p> <p>It warns that planned jobs, and other benefits, might no longer be delivered to deprived communities. \"Areas already suffering from urban decay may enter a spiral of decline as the cancer spreads, making it even more difficult for future regeneration efforts to succeed,\" it said. </p> <p>At the heart of the dispute is the partnership investment programme, overseen by Mr Prescott's Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions. It provides grants for developers to kick-start urban regeneration schemes, from converting old warehouses into flats to clearing derelict and contaminated sites for new homes and workshops. </p> <p>The EU says the programme constitutes state aid and should be vetoed. </p> <p>The Housebuilders' Federation said \u00a3700m of grants had encouraged developers to spend \u00a31.4bn on new projects.

      "bodyText": "Multibillion pound programmes to revive inner cities and create work in depressed regions and coalfield communities face being vetoed by Brussels because they breach EU rules on state aid. Anxious Labour MPs have joined builders and developers to warn that thousands of jobs are at risk with a cloud hanging over hundreds of urban regeneration and job creation initiatives. In a hard hitting report, the Commons environment committee has warned that meddling by Brussels will have \"severe consequences\" for the deputy prime minister John Prescott's vision of an urban renaissance, which is tied to the regeneration of brownfield sites. Mr Prescott has set a target of building 60% of new homes on such sites. Fuelling the debate about Britain's relationship with the EU, the environment committee says that \"illogical and ill-considered\" rulings from Brussels are bringing the EU into disrepute. It warns that planned jobs, and other benefits, might no longer be delivered to deprived communities. \"Areas already suffering from urban decay may enter a spiral of decline as the cancer spreads, making it even more difficult for future regeneration efforts to succeed,\" it said. At the heart of the dispute is the partnership investment programme, overseen by Mr Prescott's Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions. It provides grants for developers to kick-start urban regeneration schemes, from converting old warehouses into flats to clearing derelict and contaminated sites for new homes and workshops. The EU says the programme constitutes state aid and should be vetoed. The Housebuilders' Federation said \u00a3700m of grants had encouraged developers to spend \u00a31.4bn on new projects. This had led to the rebirth of city centres, from Manchester and Leeds to Newcastle and Sheffield, with thousands of people moving into new homes. Last year around 3,000 acres were cleaned up and 7,500 new houses and flats provided in cities. Although Brussels says that schemes in the pipeline can be completed, the Housebuilders Federation warned yesterday that the EU stance is likely to have a \"devastating\" impact on Mr Prescott's target for brownfield building. \"This is a terrible blow because housebuilders are close to hitting the target and without gap funding [grants] they will have to turn down the opportunity of redeveloping many of these areas because they cannot be expected to work at a loss,\" it said. \"City centres have been transformed and now all of this is at risk because of an annoying and frankly silly ruling.\" Problems have been compounded on two other fronts. This week the regeneration magazine, New Start, revealed that a \u00a315m fund to revive former pit villages has been frozen and may be outlawed under EU rules. Launched in 1998, the coalfield enterprise fund was hailed as a sign of the government's commitment to rebuilding coalfield communities, devastated by pit closures in the early 1990s. But the European Commission now says the scheme is being examined to see if it, too, complies with EU state aid rules. For two years, agencies have been given no explanation as to why they cannot tap into the fund. \"Although this money was promised in 1998, nothing has been drawn from it,\" said Dave Perry of the Coalfield Communities Campaign. Brussels has also frozen the Department of Trade and Industry's \u00a3150m regional venture capital fund, designed to encourage new businesses and entrepreneurs in depressed areas. The Department of the Environment said it was extremely concerned by the commission's rulings. \"We were disappointed when they ruled that the partnership investment programme breached state aid rules because we explained that this did not constitute state aid as such.\" Alternative measures to assist cities, coalfield communities and new businesses were being considered, it said.",

The notorious Fat Cat in Norwich makes an appearance, along with the Dolphin in Shrewsbury - where pets are permitted but women and children discouraged. London coverage is rather patchy. Camra Hardcore real ale fans can obtain Camra's Good Beer Guide and find details of the campaign's festivals here. More listings are available at the Real Ale Guide. Queerale The Lesbian and Gay Real Ale Drinkers list numerous gay (and gay-friendly) pubs serving ale in various counties. This is London pub guide Particularly helpful if you are looking for a London pub serving good food. Reviews are pleasingly evocative. See www.timeout.com/london for more succinct verdicts. Jim's York Pub Guide Jim's efforts have not been rewarded with many visitors, which is a pity: this is a comprehensive guide.",

He attributes his needs for such exploits to the effects of middle age. </p> <p>But when he's at home in Hampshire and needs to escape from the lecture hall and word processor, the military historian often heads for the more subtle and quintessentially English delights of nearby Selborne Common, a large triangle of hilly meadow and woodland run by the National Trust and overlooking the village of the same name. </p> <p>Part of his enjoyment is his growing sense of belonging to this part of the country, where he has lived for 20 years. \"I now feel that this is my landscape and my country,\" he says, \"and I love it all the more because it gives me a sense of place which I suppose I've always ached for and which gets more important as I grow older. </p> <p>\"There are all sorts of good reasons why living in a village just up the road from Selbourne isn't a good idea - I have to get to Shrivenham, where I teach, and I have to get to London, and neither is very easy - but I just like the landscape, I like the country and the people and I don't want to move.\" </p> <p>The natural starting point for a walk round Selborne Common is the zig-zag path that was cut by the 18th-century naturalist and clergyman Gilbert White, now considered to be Britain's first ecologist, who lived in the village and wrote his famous volume The Natural History of Selborne. </p> <p>The path takes you up through a beech hanger - a wood on a steep hillside - to a point looking down to the village, where White is buried under a modest gravestone in St Mary's churchyard, and away to the distant Surrey hills around Guildford. </p> <p>Here you have to make a choice between plunging into the woods or skirting the edge of the Common and keeping the views. </p> <p>Holmes finds the broad-leaved woods particularly delightful because they remind him of the thrumming tones of Vaughan Williams' Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis: \"It's a deep English wood which has been there for a long time and will be there for a long time when I'm gone. </p> <p>\"It's the classic dripping English beechwood which shuts out the light if you're in the middle of it. And in high summer, it's one of those woods which is dark, and cooler than it is outside; you hear the buzz of insects and it shuts out the sounds of the road.\" </p> <p>Round the outside, the views are bright in spring, hazy in summer, laced with the smell of smoke in the autumn. Holmes says they always lift his spirits, no matter how hard-worked or depressed he feels: \"There is nothing like a walk or a gallop, especially in this landscape which has scale and style and which reminds me of how small and unimportant I am. </p> <p>\"I think that's very healthy and necessary; I find it uplifting because I get nailed down by the orthodoxies and pressures of daily work. There are things that are more important than the next deadline, and there are matters of greater moment than a split infinitive - this landscape in particular makes that point very forcefully.\" </p> <p>Holmes's talk of a gallop refers to his horse Thatch, which he bought 10 years ago for a ride retracing the British withdrawal in 1914 from Mons in Belgium to Fontainebleau in France. Thatch is large and grey and unfashionable-looking, but Holmes thought him a terrific animal and couldn't bear to part with him. </p> <p>His outings on Selborne Common are often on horseback, and he enjoys it just as much when the elements turn nasty: \"I'm an all-weather man - I take a perverse pleasure in wearing a good oiled mac, buttoned up to the throat, sitting there with the ever-reliable Thatch plodding away underneath me and the rain pelting down. </p> <p>\"I get a real kick out of surviving the weather, and the kick is heightened by the certainty of a glass of malt and a hot bath, I have to say.\" </p> <p><strong>Britain's first ecologist </strong><br></p> <p> The Natural History of Selborne, written by the Rev Gilbert White and published in 1789, is presented in the form of letters to a friend and contains stories and meticulous observations of the plants, birds and animals of the locality and beyond. </p> <p>He debates whether is true that adders keep their young in their mouths, and tells an anecdote about visiting the Duke of Richmond to see his moose: the animal died before he got there, but was still strapped in a standing position displaying \"an extraordinarily copious lip\".</p> <p>White, a fellow of an Oxford college as well as a clergyman and a naturalist, was an archetypal 18th-century man with an interest in almost anything. He lived at The Wakes in Selborne, which is now open to the public.

I wrote to Dazer UK to complain. A sweet-talking rep phoned back and told me that dogs only hear the high-frequency signal when they are \"sufficiently aroused\", which sounds like a cop out to me. Charles Arthurs Last year in Zanzibar, I met a Belgian woman, who was entirely untroubled by mosquitoes thanks to an amazing battery-powered device which emitted a high-powered sound. Where can I buy one? Helen Jacobs \u0095 If you have a question or advice, please send it to: Ask a fellow traveller, The Guardian, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER.

      "bodyText": "Plaid Cymru should set its sights high and aim to take over from Labour as the main political force in Wales, the party's annual conference was told yesterday. In his first conference speech as president, Ieuan Wyn Jones, said Plaid was facing the greatest challenge in its history, that of winning the trust of the Welsh people to govern the country following the 2003 assembly elections. New Labour's shift to the right, he told the party faithful in Llandudno, was leaving Wales with \"an enormous political vacuum\". But it was not enough to expect people to vote for Plaid because they were disillusioned with the present administration. Plaid's aim was to form a government that would have the will to bring about \"real change\" in Wales. It was not seeking the chance to govern as an aim in itself and would have to prove to the Welsh electorate that it was worthy of its trust. \"This will mean a different approach to our politics,\" he warned. \"Calling on Labour to do this and that will no longer be enough. We will have to show what Plaid Cymru would do in government. It means not to promise more than we will be able to deliver.\" Mr Jones said the coming general election would be of \"utmost importance\" for Wales which needed a voice in Westminster pushing the cause of securing law-making powers for the assembly. The party had to make sure that that objective of securing parity with Scotland would become one of the major issues in the election campaign. Mr Jones said the assembly's lack of powers were becoming increasingly apparent and were preventing it from creating the conditions needed to improve the lives of the people of Wales. \"We are all agreed that the priority for us now is for Wales to gain the same powers as Scotland,\" he said. \"The national assembly must grow into a real parliament that can get things done, and this must happen soon. We will continue to languish as a country if we continue to let ourselves be treated as a second class nation.\" Accusing Downing Street of pursuing policies that were leading to a \"grotesque disparity\" between the richer and poorer parts of Britain, he said Plaid's manifesto would set out demands for a radical change in fiscal and economic policy. At the heart of its demand would be the use of fiscal policy to fund investment and economic development in areas of disadvantage such as Wales. Such an approach would allow a reduction in interest rates, and a lowering of the pound against the euro, enabling Wales's manufacturers, its steel industry and farmers to compete on a level playing field. Mr Jones said that it was a disgrace that Wales, birthplace of the NHS, had one of the worst health records in Europe. \"Somebody must be honest enough to say that only through a substantial increase in public spending can we achieve a better health service, better education and better public transport.\" With the party about to embark on a major consultation on its long-term constitutional objectives Mr Jones insisted that Plaid made no secret of its high ambitions for Wales in an increasingly interdependent world. \"We see our aspiration of full national status within the EU in the context of the far-reaching changes that are taking place in Britain, Europe and the world. \"We want Wales to have as much control over her affairs as is possible and necessary to determine her own destiny.\" \u0095 The conference will today condemn plans for the 2001 national census as flawed and unresponsive to the needs of devolution because people in Wales will not be given the opportunity to describe themselves as Welsh.",

      "bodyText": "Plaid Cymru should set its sights high and aim to take over from Labour as the main political force in Wales, the party's annual conference was told yesterday. In his first conference speech as president, Ieuan Wyn Jones, said Plaid was facing the greatest challenge in its history, that of winning the trust of the Welsh people to govern the country following the 2003 assembly elections. New Labour's shift to the right, he told the party faithful in Llandudno, was leaving Wales with \"an enormous political vacuum\". But it was not enough to expect people to vote for Plaid because they were disillusioned with the present administration. Plaid's aim was to form a government that would have the will to bring about \"real change\" in Wales. It was not seeking the chance to govern as an aim in itself and would have to prove to the Welsh electorate that it was worthy of its trust. \"This will mean a different approach to our politics,\" he warned. \"Calling on Labour to do this and that will no longer be enough. We will have to show what Plaid Cymru would do in government. It means not to promise more than we will be able to deliver.\" Mr Jones said the coming general election would be of \"utmost importance\" for Wales which needed a voice in Westminster pushing the cause of securing law-making powers for the assembly. The party had to make sure that that objective of securing parity with Scotland would become one of the major issues in the election campaign. Mr Jones said the assembly's lack of powers were becoming increasingly apparent and were preventing it from creating the conditions needed to improve the lives of the people of Wales. \"We are all agreed that the priority for us now is for Wales to gain the same powers as Scotland,\" he said. \"The national assembly must grow into a real parliament that can get things done, and this must happen soon. We will continue to languish as a country if we continue to let ourselves be treated as a second class nation.\" Accusing Downing Street of pursuing policies that were leading to a \"grotesque disparity\" between the richer and poorer parts of Britain, he said Plaid's manifesto would set out demands for a radical change in fiscal and economic policy. At the heart of its demand would be the use of fiscal policy to fund investment and economic development in areas of disadvantage such as Wales. Such an approach would allow a reduction in interest rates, and a lowering of the pound against the euro, enabling Wales's manufacturers, its steel industry and farmers to compete on a level playing field. Mr Jones said that it was a disgrace that Wales, birthplace of the NHS, had one of the worst health records in Europe. \"Somebody must be honest enough to say that only through a substantial increase in public spending can we achieve a better health service, better education and better public transport.\" With the party about to embark on a major consultation on its long-term constitutional objectives Mr Jones insisted that Plaid made no secret of its high ambitions for Wales in an increasingly interdependent world. \"We see our aspiration of full national status within the EU in the context of the far-reaching changes that are taking place in Britain, Europe and the world. \"We want Wales to have as much control over her affairs as is possible and necessary to determine her own destiny.\" \u0095 The conference will today condemn plans for the 2001 national census as flawed and unresponsive to the needs of devolution because people in Wales will not be given the opportunity to describe themselves as Welsh.",

In his valedictory speech to party activists at their conference in Inverness, Mr Salmond said the Scottish parliament was at the start of a process which would lead Scotland to break its ties with the rest of the UK. The SNP were in party mode yesterday as, according to opinion polls, they had more to celebrate than simply Mr Salmond's leadership. In an ICM survey for the Scotsman, the nationalists had a seven point lead over Labour in the first round of voting for the Holyrood parliament and a four point lead in the second proportional representation element. This is the first time the SNP has taken the lead in first and second voting intentions for the Scottish parliament in an ICM poll. Under Mr Salmond's leadership the SNP has moved from being a fringe party to the status of official opposition at Holyrood, but the SNP leader claimed his greater aim of an independent Scotland was just around the corner. \"Independence will arrive in this political generation.

It has also agreed to remove notices disclaiming responsibility from its check-in desks. </p> <p>Following intervention by the OFT, the airline will no longer operate a blanket refusal to take responsibility for oversized or over-packed baggage. Nor will it refuse to pay out if any protruding parts on luggage, such as wheels or handles, are damaged or lost in transit. </p> <p>Ryanair now only refuses to accept responsibility for unsuitably packed, perishable, damaged or fragile baggage and for minor damage to the outside of luggage caused by normal wear and tear. </p> <p>Bridgman said: \"These two pieces of work will ensure that airlines' contracts are soon much fairer and that tens of millions of travellers will have less bad news to write in their postcards home.\"</p>",

The new terms make it clear that we will be entitled to a refund if there is a significant delay which is the airline's fault and the operator is unable to provide an alternative flight.\" The new terms include: * Anyone prevented from travelling by force-majeur -circumstances beyond their control - will be entitled to a credit for any non-refundable travel. This can be used to buy a flight for another person. * If a traveller warns an airline that a part of a ticket cannot be used for reasons beyond his or her control, no extra charge will be made. The Office of Fair Trading had challenged the right to cancel onward reservations if the outward portion of a ticket was not used. * Passengers should if possible be told of a flight time change. Passengers will also have the right to a refund if there is a significant change in the time of a flight and the airline is not able to book an acceptable alternative flight. * Airlines can no longer evade responsibility for what their agents have agreed. In a separate development, Ryanair has agreed to drop contract terms that limited its responsibility for travellers' luggage. It has also agreed to remove notices disclaiming responsibility from its check-in desks. Following intervention by the OFT, the airline will no longer operate a blanket refusal to take responsibility for oversized or over-packed baggage. Nor will it refuse to pay out if any protruding parts on luggage, such as wheels or handles, are damaged or lost in transit. Ryanair now only refuses to accept responsibility for unsuitably packed, perishable, damaged or fragile baggage and for minor damage to the outside of luggage caused by normal wear and tear. Bridgman said: \"These two pieces of work will ensure that airlines' contracts are soon much fairer and that tens of millions of travellers will have less bad news to write in their postcards home.\"",

      "body": "<p>The first time I went to Monaco, aged 17, I made two mistakes: I tottered around the steeply-inclined streets in high heels, under the impression that somehow one just had to wear heels in Monaco; and, daunted by the glitzy atmosphere of the Caf\u00e9 de Paris, I was too shy to spit out a dodgy oyster. The result was a twisted ankle and 24 hours throwing up in my hotel room, but the lessons were crucial to my future enjoyment of the place: wear flat shoes, and don't be intimidated by the flash brashness of the place. </p> <p>Ever since Grace Kelly left Hollywood in the 1950s to become princess of this tiny tax haven in the south of France - less than two square kilometres - the Principality of Monaco has enjoyed a reputation for wealth and glamour. And while it's easy to spend a small fortune there in a very short time, it is also quite possible to enjoy most of what it has to offer on a moderate budget. </p> <p><strong> What to see</strong><br> </p> <p> Monaco-ville, the old town, can be very pretty out of season; the narrow alleys are a complete contrast with the high rises of the rest of the principality, and the square in front of the palace offers beautiful views of both ports. However, in July and August it becomes overcrowded and tacky - you wouldn't catch a Monegasque there. </p> <p>The changing of the guard outside the palace at 11.55 every morning attracts surprisingly big crowds for what is a fairly uninteresting spectacle, but the impressive <strong> Aquarium and Mus\u00e9e Oc\u00e9anographique</strong> (tel 93 15 36 00, Ffr60) are worth a look. Being the tourist zone, the food is uniformly bad in this part of town, so eat elsewhere if you can; if you must, then mussels, chips and dessert (Ffr65) at <strong> Tony's</strong> (6 rue CF Gastaldi, tel 93 30 81 37) is the best bet. </p> <p><strong> Place de Casino</strong> is the heart of Monaco, and not to be missed. The square never stops being impressive, from the ornate Grand Casino itself to the opulent Hotel de Paris, the art-deco Caf\u00e9 de Paris and the casino gardens with their often surprising, sometimes ugly but always original display of modern sculpture. The <strong> Grand Casino</strong> (entrance Ffr50, dress smartly and bring your passport) is just wonderful, with high arched frescoed ceilings and marble, gilt and extravagance wherever you look. </p> <p>It seems a shame to go to Monaco and not have a spin on the roulette wheel, but even if you don't gamble it's worth coming in just to watch. </p> <p>The yachts adorning the Port of Monaco are yet another voyeuristic pleasure. </p> <p>There is only so much sightseeing you can take in high season, when hot sun and clear skies are almost assured. So, if you feel like throwing your money about, head for the beach club (Ffr200 a day plus Ffr115 for a lounger) at the <strong> Monte Carlo Beach Hotel</strong> (Avenue Princesse Grace, Roquebrune-Cap- Martin, tel 00 33 493 28 66 66) along with half the residents in town. It's got three great restaurants and a huge salt-water pool as well as shops and watersports, but be warned: they'd charge you for breathing if they could. </p> <p>The rest of Monaco's residents think that this is a patently ridiculous amount of money to pay to lie in the sun, and go to <strong> Larvotto</strong>, the Monaco beach. It's not great, and it gets pretty crowded, but it is free (or a fraction of the cost if you want to rent a lounger). </p> <p>When it's a little cooler, the most luxurious thing to do is spend a day at the <strong> Thermes Marins</strong>, (2, Avenue de Monte Carlo, tel 92 16 40 40, Ffr430 per day, with treatments from Ffr150). If the mud wrap - where they cover you in evil-smelling goo and then wrap you in an electric blanket and leave you to stew - sounds like hell, they've got a gorgeous pool, gym, restaurant and terrace overlooking the port. </p> <p><strong> Where to eat</strong><br> </p> <p> The <strong> Vistamar</strong>, at the Htel Hermitage (Square Beaumarchais, tel 92 16 27 72), is the most romantic of Monaco's many top restaurants. For summer dining, the terrace overlooks the port; in winter, the extravagant vaulted dining room couldn't be more glamorous. The prices are steep, at about Ffr1,000 for two, but the food is wonderful. </p> <p>The <strong> Quai des Artistes</strong> (Quai Antoine 1er, tel 97 97 97 77) is a new restaurant on the port. The food is good, the menu wide, the setting agreeable and the prices acceptable, coming in at around Ffr500 for dinner for two with wine. </p> <p>For excellent Italian food, <strong> Rigoletto</strong> (11 Rue du Portier, tel 93 25 24 28) is great, and very untouristy. A meal for two costs around Ffr500; I particularly recommend the seafood risotto. </p> <p><strong> La Sali\u00e8re</strong> (Quai des Sanbarbani on Monaco's second port in Fontvieille, tel 92 05 25 82) is a good place for a quick pasta (Ffr65) if you fancy something simple. Take the opportunity to stroll around this pretty port as well; there aren't that many other reasons to come to this part of town. </p> <p>For a snack or a light lunch, <strong> Festival </strong> (Plages du Larvotto - on the promenade) provides decent salads and cr pes for around Ffr60. It's not much more than a booth, but it has tables and chairs outside and is a very pleasant place for lunch summer or winter. </p> <p><strong> Bars and nightlife</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Caf\u00e9 de Paris</strong> (Place du Casino, tel 92 16 20 20). Get one of the small tables right on the square and enjoy late-night drinks watching the world go by in its finery. </p> <p><strong> Sass Caf\u00e9 </strong> (11, Avenue Princesse Grace, tel 93 25 52 00). Also does excellent, if expensive, food, but after dinner the live music starts up, and the bar starts to rock. People dance on the tables until the small hours. If you're not eating, you should still be able to get a table in the bar if you turn up at about 11pm. </p> <p>The <strong> Rascasse </strong> (Quai Antoine 1er, tel 93 25 56 90). The bar downstairs is the place to be. It's on the port, and also on one of the most difficult bends of the Grand Prix, which makes it a prime venue during the race. Live music and lots of drinking until very late. </p> <p>Nearby, at the end of the quay, <strong> Stars 'n' Bars</strong> (Quai Antoine 1er, tel 93 50 95 95) is one of young Monaco's favourite hangouts, though it has been going downhill recently and looks a bit tatty. It's basically a burger joint, but the bar is big, the tequila flows, and the music is loud. </p> <p>The nightclub <strong> Jimmy'z</strong> (Le Sporting, Avenue Princesse Grace, tel 92 16 22 77) is much more upmarket, and such an institution it's almost a clich\u00e9 to go there. Entry is free but the price of drinks extortionate. The most cost-effective option is to go in a group and buy a bottle of vodka (Ffr1,500) to share (up to eight people); mixers are free. </p> <p><strong> Where to stay</strong><br> </p> <p> The <strong> Htel de Paris</strong> (Place du Casino, tel 92 16 30 00, Ffr2,240-3,710 a double) is the place to go if you can. It is in the heart of Monaco and you couldn't find a more luxurious and extravagant place to stay. </p> <p>The best thing about the <strong> Htel Miramar</strong> (1 Avenue JF Kennedy, tel 93 30 86 48, Ffr800 a double) is its location right on the port. All the rooms have great views, but there are only 12 so book well in advance. This would be a brilliant place to stay during the Grand Prix. </p> <p><strong> Htel Alexandra</strong> (35 Bvd Princess-Charlotte, tel 93 50 63 13, Ffr580-890 a double) is an attractive turn-of-the-century building, though the inside is somewhat less grand. However, it is comfortable and central. </p> <p>The <strong> Htel de France</strong> (6, Rue de la Turbie, tel 93 30 24 64, Ffr490-570 a double with shower) is reasonably priced, clean, fairly comfortable and only a short walk from the port and the railway station. </p> <p>The <strong> Htel Cosmopolite</strong> (4, Rue de la Turbie, tel 93 30 16 95, Ffr338 a double with shower) is the cheapest hotel in Monaco and quite central, although it doesn't have a lot else to recommend it. </p> <p><strong> When to go</strong><br> </p> <p> True to its reputation as a party town, there is always something going on in Monaco. The Monaco Tourist Office (020-7352 9962) can supply details, but some of the best events are: </p> <p>* <strong> The International Fireworks Festival</strong>. It takes place in the port every few days in July, and the standard is incredibly high; this is one of the best things to do in Monaco in the summer, and it's free. Look out for posters giving the dates of each entry. </p> <p>* <strong> The Monte Carlo International Circus Festival</strong>, late January/early February. Tickets cost Ffr100-400 (tel 00 377 92 05 23 45 for reservations). </p> <p>* The <strong> Grand Prix</strong> in May is Monaco's most famous event, and the principality gets packed. Prices skyrocket, and you can't get a table in a restaurant or a taxi for love or money, but there's a great atmosphere. For tickets (from Ffr250), call the Monaco Royal Automobile Club (tel 00 377 93 15 26 00). </p> <p>Monaco is not quite the cultural desert that it seems at first glance, and the fabulous <strong> Salle Garnier</strong> room of the Grand Casino is a wonderful place to see opera in January, February and March, or ballet in the winter. In the height of summer, <strong> Les Nuits de la Danse </strong> ballet season is held on the Casino terraces looking out to the sea, and the Monte Carlo Philharmonic Orchestra performs outside in the courtyard of the Palace. </p> <p><strong> How to get there</strong><br> </p> <p> EasyJet (tel 0870 600 0000, <a href=\"http://www.easyJet.com\">www.easyJet.com</a>) flies from Luton to Nice from \u00a340 return. </p> <p>Helicopter is the most scenic way to get from Nice to Monaco. Heli Air Monaco (tel 92 05 00 50) costs Ffr400 one way for the seven-minute flight. The bus from Nice airport to Monaco (Ffr80) leaves hourly and takes an hour.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The first time I went to Monaco, aged 17, I made two mistakes: I tottered around the steeply-inclined streets in high heels, under the impression that somehow one just had to wear heels in Monaco; and, daunted by the glitzy atmosphere of the Caf\u00e9 de Paris, I was too shy to spit out a dodgy oyster. The result was a twisted ankle and 24 hours throwing up in my hotel room, but the lessons were crucial to my future enjoyment of the place: wear flat shoes, and don't be intimidated by the flash brashness of the place. Ever since Grace Kelly left Hollywood in the 1950s to become princess of this tiny tax haven in the south of France - less than two square kilometres - the Principality of Monaco has enjoyed a reputation for wealth and glamour. And while it's easy to spend a small fortune there in a very short time, it is also quite possible to enjoy most of what it has to offer on a moderate budget. What to see Monaco-ville, the old town, can be very pretty out of season; the narrow alleys are a complete contrast with the high rises of the rest of the principality, and the square in front of the palace offers beautiful views of both ports. However, in July and August it becomes overcrowded and tacky - you wouldn't catch a Monegasque there. The changing of the guard outside the palace at 11.55 every morning attracts surprisingly big crowds for what is a fairly uninteresting spectacle, but the impressive Aquarium and Mus\u00e9e Oc\u00e9anographique (tel 93 15 36 00, Ffr60) are worth a look. Being the tourist zone, the food is uniformly bad in this part of town, so eat elsewhere if you can; if you must, then mussels, chips and dessert (Ffr65) at Tony's (6 rue CF Gastaldi, tel 93 30 81 37) is the best bet. Place de Casino is the heart of Monaco, and not to be missed. The square never stops being impressive, from the ornate Grand Casino itself to the opulent Hotel de Paris, the art-deco Caf\u00e9 de Paris and the casino gardens with their often surprising, sometimes ugly but always original display of modern sculpture. The Grand Casino (entrance Ffr50, dress smartly and bring your passport) is just wonderful, with high arched frescoed ceilings and marble, gilt and extravagance wherever you look. It seems a shame to go to Monaco and not have a spin on the roulette wheel, but even if you don't gamble it's worth coming in just to watch. The yachts adorning the Port of Monaco are yet another voyeuristic pleasure. There is only so much sightseeing you can take in high season, when hot sun and clear skies are almost assured. So, if you feel like throwing your money about, head for the beach club (Ffr200 a day plus Ffr115 for a lounger) at the Monte Carlo Beach Hotel (Avenue Princesse Grace, Roquebrune-Cap- Martin, tel 00 33 493 28 66 66) along with half the residents in town. It's got three great restaurants and a huge salt-water pool as well as shops and watersports, but be warned: they'd charge you for breathing if they could. The rest of Monaco's residents think that this is a patently ridiculous amount of money to pay to lie in the sun, and go to Larvotto, the Monaco beach. It's not great, and it gets pretty crowded, but it is free (or a fraction of the cost if you want to rent a lounger). When it's a little cooler, the most luxurious thing to do is spend a day at the Thermes Marins, (2, Avenue de Monte Carlo, tel 92 16 40 40, Ffr430 per day, with treatments from Ffr150). If the mud wrap - where they cover you in evil-smelling goo and then wrap you in an electric blanket and leave you to stew - sounds like hell, they've got a gorgeous pool, gym, restaurant and terrace overlooking the port. Where to eat The Vistamar, at the Htel Hermitage (Square Beaumarchais, tel 92 16 27 72), is the most romantic of Monaco's many top restaurants. For summer dining, the terrace overlooks the port; in winter, the extravagant vaulted dining room couldn't be more glamorous. The prices are steep, at about Ffr1,000 for two, but the food is wonderful. The Quai des Artistes (Quai Antoine 1er, tel 97 97 97 77) is a new restaurant on the port. The food is good, the menu wide, the setting agreeable and the prices acceptable, coming in at around Ffr500 for dinner for two with wine. For excellent Italian food, Rigoletto (11 Rue du Portier, tel 93 25 24 28) is great, and very untouristy. A meal for two costs around Ffr500; I particularly recommend the seafood risotto. La Sali\u00e8re (Quai des Sanbarbani on Monaco's second port in Fontvieille, tel 92 05 25 82) is a good place for a quick pasta (Ffr65) if you fancy something simple. Take the opportunity to stroll around this pretty port as well; there aren't that many other reasons to come to this part of town. For a snack or a light lunch, Festival (Plages du Larvotto - on the promenade) provides decent salads and cr pes for around Ffr60. It's not much more than a booth, but it has tables and chairs outside and is a very pleasant place for lunch summer or winter. Bars and nightlife Caf\u00e9 de Paris (Place du Casino, tel 92 16 20 20). Get one of the small tables right on the square and enjoy late-night drinks watching the world go by in its finery. Sass Caf\u00e9 (11, Avenue Princesse Grace, tel 93 25 52 00). Also does excellent, if expensive, food, but after dinner the live music starts up, and the bar starts to rock. People dance on the tables until the small hours. If you're not eating, you should still be able to get a table in the bar if you turn up at about 11pm. The Rascasse (Quai Antoine 1er, tel 93 25 56 90). The bar downstairs is the place to be. It's on the port, and also on one of the most difficult bends of the Grand Prix, which makes it a prime venue during the race. Live music and lots of drinking until very late. Nearby, at the end of the quay, Stars 'n' Bars (Quai Antoine 1er, tel 93 50 95 95) is one of young Monaco's favourite hangouts, though it has been going downhill recently and looks a bit tatty. It's basically a burger joint, but the bar is big, the tequila flows, and the music is loud. The nightclub Jimmy'z (Le Sporting, Avenue Princesse Grace, tel 92 16 22 77) is much more upmarket, and such an institution it's almost a clich\u00e9 to go there. Entry is free but the price of drinks extortionate. The most cost-effective option is to go in a group and buy a bottle of vodka (Ffr1,500) to share (up to eight people); mixers are free. Where to stay The Htel de Paris (Place du Casino, tel 92 16 30 00, Ffr2,240-3,710 a double) is the place to go if you can. It is in the heart of Monaco and you couldn't find a more luxurious and extravagant place to stay. The best thing about the Htel Miramar (1 Avenue JF Kennedy, tel 93 30 86 48, Ffr800 a double) is its location right on the port. All the rooms have great views, but there are only 12 so book well in advance. This would be a brilliant place to stay during the Grand Prix. Htel Alexandra (35 Bvd Princess-Charlotte, tel 93 50 63 13, Ffr580-890 a double) is an attractive turn-of-the-century building, though the inside is somewhat less grand. However, it is comfortable and central. The Htel de France (6, Rue de la Turbie, tel 93 30 24 64, Ffr490-570 a double with shower) is reasonably priced, clean, fairly comfortable and only a short walk from the port and the railway station. The Htel Cosmopolite (4, Rue de la Turbie, tel 93 30 16 95, Ffr338 a double with shower) is the cheapest hotel in Monaco and quite central, although it doesn't have a lot else to recommend it. When to go True to its reputation as a party town, there is always something going on in Monaco. The Monaco Tourist Office (020-7352 9962) can supply details, but some of the best events are: * The International Fireworks Festival. It takes place in the port every few days in July, and the standard is incredibly high; this is one of the best things to do in Monaco in the summer, and it's free. Look out for posters giving the dates of each entry. * The Monte Carlo International Circus Festival, late January/early February. Tickets cost Ffr100-400 (tel 00 377 92 05 23 45 for reservations). * The Grand Prix in May is Monaco's most famous event, and the principality gets packed. Prices skyrocket, and you can't get a table in a restaurant or a taxi for love or money, but there's a great atmosphere. For tickets (from Ffr250), call the Monaco Royal Automobile Club (tel 00 377 93 15 26 00). Monaco is not quite the cultural desert that it seems at first glance, and the fabulous Salle Garnier room of the Grand Casino is a wonderful place to see opera in January, February and March, or ballet in the winter. In the height of summer, Les Nuits de la Danse ballet season is held on the Casino terraces looking out to the sea, and the Monte Carlo Philharmonic Orchestra performs outside in the courtyard of the Palace. How to get there EasyJet (tel 0870 600 0000, www.easyJet.com) flies from Luton to Nice from \u00a340 return. Helicopter is the most scenic way to get from Nice to Monaco. Heli Air Monaco (tel 92 05 00 50) costs Ffr400 one way for the seven-minute flight. The bus from Nice airport to Monaco (Ffr80) leaves hourly and takes an hour.",

You've seen Tony Cox in many movies before: Friday, I'm Gonna Git You Sucka, assorted Ewoks-heavy George Lucas productions... But you've never seen him like you will in Me, Myself &amp; Irene. He plays the Mensa member little person who beats up Jim Carrey's doormat cop, fathers three genius sons with the woebegone white guy's bride, then leaves them for the loser to raise when he and the wife run off together.</p> <p><strong>How did it feel to kick Jim Carrey's butt?</strong></p> <p>Felt good. Felt gooood.</p> <p><strong>What about working for the Farrellys? They're infamous for blurring the line between good and bad taste, and many critics felt that they crossed way too far over it with this movie.</strong></p> <p>Well, they're over the top. But, basically, for me this was a good role. It was a good role for a little person. Once I read the script, I knew I had to have it because I knew what I could do with it. Then, the good thing about them is that they just let you be you; you can ad-lib, just go with it.</p> <p><strong>Give an example.</strong></p> <p>The nunchucks were my idea. I don't think they thought I could really work 'em, but I had 'em in the car and showed them.</p> <p><strong>Did you have any reservations about playing a role that could be construed as demeaning to black people, dwarves and geniuses all at the same time?</strong></p> <p>Well, at first I thought about the NAACP [one of America's oldest civil rights groups, which monitors minority representations in films]. But then, the more I looked into it, the more I felt it was going to be all right.</p> <p><strong>Is it your first \"romantic\" part?</strong></p> <p>Yes, and that's why I wanted this role. When they told me that [actress] Traylor Howard really wanted to make out in the scene, my heart went boom-boom-boom.</p> <p><strong>This certainly isn't the kind of thing that little people have traditionally done in movies. But you and Verne Troyer, who played Mini-Me in last year's Austin Powers sequel, seem to be charting new territory.</strong></p> <p>Yeah, and I think it's going to get better. When Verne did his thing, it opened up doors. Most of the time, when a little person was used, everybody was downing him, he was the butt of the jokes. Those are roles that I don't accept anyway, but I've noticed that, since The Spy Who Shagged Me, whenever I go in on auditions people say they're looking for that Verne type. And this movie will open up more doors, because not only am I an African-American, I have romance with an average-size lady. And you know, a lot of little people marry average-size partners. My wife is average height; love has no colour, love has no height.</p> <p><strong>How did you become an actor?</strong></p> <p>Back in Alabama, I was a percussionist. But my high school was so small, they didn't teach you how to read music, and I needed that to get into college. So the only other thing I could think of doing was acting. I had an uncle out in California, so I came to Los Angeles to study.</p> <p><strong>Now that you've come this far, what are your goals for the future?</strong></p> <p>I want to do drama some time on down the road. But comedy is the thing right now, and I always like making people laugh. But I want a role in which I can give people a better perspective of little people and their talents. Hopefully, that will come about some day.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Move over, Mini-Me. There's a new, metrically challenged sex symbol in town. You've seen Tony Cox in many movies before: Friday, I'm Gonna Git You Sucka, assorted Ewoks-heavy George Lucas productions... But you've never seen him like you will in Me, Myself &amp; Irene. He plays the Mensa member little person who beats up Jim Carrey's doormat cop, fathers three genius sons with the woebegone white guy's bride, then leaves them for the loser to raise when he and the wife run off together. How did it feel to kick Jim Carrey's butt? Felt good. Felt gooood. What about working for the Farrellys? They're infamous for blurring the line between good and bad taste, and many critics felt that they crossed way too far over it with this movie. Well, they're over the top. But, basically, for me this was a good role. It was a good role for a little person. Once I read the script, I knew I had to have it because I knew what I could do with it. Then, the good thing about them is that they just let you be you; you can ad-lib, just go with it. Give an example. The nunchucks were my idea. I don't think they thought I could really work 'em, but I had 'em in the car and showed them. Did you have any reservations about playing a role that could be construed as demeaning to black people, dwarves and geniuses all at the same time? Well, at first I thought about the NAACP [one of America's oldest civil rights groups, which monitors minority representations in films]. But then, the more I looked into it, the more I felt it was going to be all right. Is it your first \"romantic\" part? Yes, and that's why I wanted this role. When they told me that [actress] Traylor Howard really wanted to make out in the scene, my heart went boom-boom-boom. This certainly isn't the kind of thing that little people have traditionally done in movies. But you and Verne Troyer, who played Mini-Me in last year's Austin Powers sequel, seem to be charting new territory. Yeah, and I think it's going to get better. When Verne did his thing, it opened up doors. Most of the time, when a little person was used, everybody was downing him, he was the butt of the jokes. Those are roles that I don't accept anyway, but I've noticed that, since The Spy Who Shagged Me, whenever I go in on auditions people say they're looking for that Verne type. And this movie will open up more doors, because not only am I an African-American, I have romance with an average-size lady. And you know, a lot of little people marry average-size partners. My wife is average height; love has no colour, love has no height. How did you become an actor? Back in Alabama, I was a percussionist. But my high school was so small, they didn't teach you how to read music, and I needed that to get into college. So the only other thing I could think of doing was acting. I had an uncle out in California, so I came to Los Angeles to study. Now that you've come this far, what are your goals for the future? I want to do drama some time on down the road. But comedy is the thing right now, and I always like making people laugh. But I want a role in which I can give people a better perspective of little people and their talents. Hopefully, that will come about some day.",

      "bodyText": "The outgoing Scottish National party leader, Alex Salmond, yesterday claimed Scotland would be independent from Westminster within a generation. In his valedictory speech to party activists at their conference in Inverness, Mr Salmond said the Scottish parliament was at the start of a process which would lead Scotland to break its ties with the rest of the UK. The SNP were in party mode yesterday as, according to opinion polls, they had more to celebrate than simply Mr Salmond's leadership. In an ICM survey for the Scotsman, the nationalists had a seven point lead over Labour in the first round of voting for the Holyrood parliament and a four point lead in the second proportional representation element. This is the first time the SNP has taken the lead in first and second voting intentions for the Scottish parliament in an ICM poll. Under Mr Salmond's leadership the SNP has moved from being a fringe party to the status of official opposition at Holyrood, but the SNP leader claimed his greater aim of an independent Scotland was just around the corner. \"Independence will arrive in this political generation. It has been a privilege to lead you part of the way,\" he said. The results of the elections for Mr Salmond's replacement will be announced this afternoon. The leadership contest between John Swinney and Alex Neil has been a fight between what are known as the gradualist and fundamentalist wings of the party. Mr Neil, a so-called fundamentalist, is in favour of using a victory in a general election as a mandate to negotiate for independence as quickly as possible, while Mr Swinney favours a referendum and a gradualist approach towards independence. Although Mr Salmond has declined to back any of the candidates outright, his comments from the podium yesterday were most in tune with the views of Mr Swinney - who is expected to win the leadership election, but with a narrower margin than had been predicted. \"The Scotish parliament is our passport to independence, and, let's be quite clear, a popular SNP administration will hold a popular vote for freedom.

Mohammed refused to sell me any petrol today, even though I had pushed the Montego to his garage to save what little fuel I had. I reminded him that I had stuck up for him in the playground at Neil Armstrong Comprehensive when Barry Kent went on a bullying rampage after eating too many Walker's crisps. \"I don't remember you stickin' up for me, Moley,\" Mohammed said as he directed a midwife towards a pump. </p> <p> I pointed out that I had advised Barry to go on a bullying-awareness course at the Off The Streets youth club. \"That didn't stop me from gettin' my fingers bent back,\" he said sadly. </p> <p> My mother drove up on the forecourt and joined the queue of essential users. \"On what grounds are you an essential user?\" I asked. \"Have you joined one of the emergency services since I saw you last?\" </p> <p> \"As a matter of fact, I have, in a way,\" she said. \"I promised to take some of my unwanted vases to Laing ward at Ivan's mental hospital. They've got nothing to put the visitors' flowers in.\" </p> <p>I wondered how she would convince Mohammed that her need of fuel was legitimate, and was infuriated when she was allowed to go to the front of the queue and was served by Mohammed himself! </p> <p> I made another attempt to procure some petrol for myself. Citing the time I directed Mohammed in the Nativity play, Jesus Christ Almighty!, and gave him the starring role. \"Yeah, yeah, and I'm still in trouble with some of the community elders 15 years later,\" he said. \"I said I'd be in trouble if I played Jesus as a heroin addict.\" </p> <p> \"You had free will, Mohammed,\" I pointed out. </p> <p> \"No, I didn't,\" he said. \"You was going through a bad time. Your parents were splittin' up, so I dun it to help you out.\" </p> <p> As I pushed my car back home, I puzzled over how a man could hold a grudge for so long. A grudge so powerful that it influenced his judgment when it came to petrol distribution. </p> <p><strong> Saturday, September 16 </strong></p> <p> Pandora is thinking of buying a house in the Suffolk countryside so she can escape from her constituents. It is called Oakley Park, in Hoxne village. I looked the property up on the net, and was alarmed to discover that it was the scene of a macabre double murder in 1777, when Sir Frederick Brownlow discovered his wife Felicity in bed with Fergus Bellington, a young groom. </p> <p> When I say \"bed\", I am using the term loosely - the lovers were actually participating in a sexual act behind the clock over the arched entranceway. As midnight struck, Sir Frederick, tormented by jealousy, chopped them into bite-sized pieces with his sword. (\"It was manayee times sharpen-ed beinge much blunted be ye bones.\") The pieces were then fed to the pigs. I warned Pandora that there was a curse on the house, and that anybody with the initials FB came to a bad end if they so much as stepped foot into the courtyard. </p> <p> \"For God's sake,\" she said, \"what are you drivelling on about? My initials are PLEB.\" She then went into a tirade saying that idiots were clogging up the internet with uninteresting and unnecessary information. </p> <p><strong> Sunday, September 17 </strong></p> <p> Battle of Britain Day: Radio 4 was dominated this morning by a dreary church service commemorating this important historical occasion. Why does the C of E allow such very terrible music to be played in its name? And why do church officials speak in such unnatural voices like aliens? </p> <p> Radio 4 should have played the soundtrack of that Douglas Bader Story. It would have given joy to many.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Thursday, September 14, Arthur Askey Walk, Ashby-de-la-Zouch So much for a lifelong friendship! Mohammed refused to sell me any petrol today, even though I had pushed the Montego to his garage to save what little fuel I had. I reminded him that I had stuck up for him in the playground at Neil Armstrong Comprehensive when Barry Kent went on a bullying rampage after eating too many Walker's crisps. \"I don't remember you stickin' up for me, Moley,\" Mohammed said as he directed a midwife towards a pump. I pointed out that I had advised Barry to go on a bullying-awareness course at the Off The Streets youth club. \"That didn't stop me from gettin' my fingers bent back,\" he said sadly. My mother drove up on the forecourt and joined the queue of essential users. \"On what grounds are you an essential user?\" I asked. \"Have you joined one of the emergency services since I saw you last?\" \"As a matter of fact, I have, in a way,\" she said. \"I promised to take some of my unwanted vases to Laing ward at Ivan's mental hospital. They've got nothing to put the visitors' flowers in.\" I wondered how she would convince Mohammed that her need of fuel was legitimate, and was infuriated when she was allowed to go to the front of the queue and was served by Mohammed himself! I made another attempt to procure some petrol for myself. Citing the time I directed Mohammed in the Nativity play, Jesus Christ Almighty!, and gave him the starring role. \"Yeah, yeah, and I'm still in trouble with some of the community elders 15 years later,\" he said. \"I said I'd be in trouble if I played Jesus as a heroin addict.\" \"You had free will, Mohammed,\" I pointed out. \"No, I didn't,\" he said. \"You was going through a bad time. Your parents were splittin' up, so I dun it to help you out.\" As I pushed my car back home, I puzzled over how a man could hold a grudge for so long. A grudge so powerful that it influenced his judgment when it came to petrol distribution. Saturday, September 16 Pandora is thinking of buying a house in the Suffolk countryside so she can escape from her constituents. It is called Oakley Park, in Hoxne village. I looked the property up on the net, and was alarmed to discover that it was the scene of a macabre double murder in 1777, when Sir Frederick Brownlow discovered his wife Felicity in bed with Fergus Bellington, a young groom. When I say \"bed\", I am using the term loosely - the lovers were actually participating in a sexual act behind the clock over the arched entranceway. As midnight struck, Sir Frederick, tormented by jealousy, chopped them into bite-sized pieces with his sword. (\"It was manayee times sharpen-ed beinge much blunted be ye bones.\") The pieces were then fed to the pigs. I warned Pandora that there was a curse on the house, and that anybody with the initials FB came to a bad end if they so much as stepped foot into the courtyard. \"For God's sake,\" she said, \"what are you drivelling on about? My initials are PLEB.\" She then went into a tirade saying that idiots were clogging up the internet with uninteresting and unnecessary information. Sunday, September 17 Battle of Britain Day: Radio 4 was dominated this morning by a dreary church service commemorating this important historical occasion. Why does the C of E allow such very terrible music to be played in its name? And why do church officials speak in such unnatural voices like aliens? Radio 4 should have played the soundtrack of that Douglas Bader Story. It would have given joy to many.",

      "byline": "Petrine Archer-Straw",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>For almost 20 years, I have considered myself a student of \"negrophilia\". This means that I spend much of my time scrutinising how white and black people relate to each other, trying especially to understand their attraction to each other.</p> <p>My scrutiny can be quite personal, focusing on how I, as a black woman, interact with others around me, particularly when I am working in England; but my exploration is also often stimulated by my time in Jamaica, where the legacy of colonialism has ensured that race relations are a constant touchstone of Caribbean existence. Sometimes, my interests are voyeuristic, and I find myself spying on mixed-race couples and wondering how they perceive each other; at other times, I have a more critical attitude, trying to grasp why, and how, European history has often, implicitly or explicitly, tended to denigrate the image and psyche of black people. </p> <p>My initial interest in negrophilia grew out of my studies in art history. I came to the subject via what modern artists in the early decades of the 20th century called \"primitivism\". The term \"negrophilia\" itself describes the craze for black culture that was prevalent among avant-garde artists and bohemian types in 20s Paris, when to collect African art, to listen to black music and to dance with black people was a sign of being modern and fashionable. In the same way that, today, aspects of black culture such as hip hop, reggae, gangsta rap, locks and Afro hairstyles proliferate, in the 20s the craze was for dances such as the charleston, the lindy hop and the black bottom, for Bakerfix hair paste, and for wearing African-inspired clothes and accessories. This passion for black culture and a \"primitivised\" existence flourished in the aftermath of the first world war, when artists yearned for a simpler, idyllic lifestyle to counter modern life's mechanistic violence. </p> <p>But, even as the \"negrophiles\" of 20s Paris affirmed a love of black people, their relationships with them demonstrated, at least covertly, sentiments closer to fear - sentiments that still persist to this day. Black personalities were eitherlionised or demonised in a manner that denied normality. I felt that an examination of these mood swings from negrophilia to negrophobia might be a useful way to see how black people have historically become objects of affection or derision, and continue to be. Negrophilia is thus about western culture exploring its perceptions of difference in such a way that best reflects white people rather than their exoticised subjects.</p> <p>Such reflections are often highlighted in sport, the arts and popular entertainment, but they are particularly evident in boxing, a sport of extremes where, historically, whites and blacks have chosen controlled abuse to deal with each other. Fights between white and black boxers create interest because they provide an arena in which the myth of black savagery can be explored and confirmed and even supported. Boxing's ritualised order makes it possible for savage and civilised to meet and to challenge each other on equal terms, and sometimes to upset the \"natural\" order of things. </p> <p>The similarities between the career of Mike Tyson at the end of the 20th century and that of Jack Johnson, his black predecessor by almost 100 years, are remarkable and instructive, especially when used to compare attitudes and tolerance to race in America and Europe. Johnson, a Texan-born fighter, boxed his way to the heavyweight championship at a time when racial tension in the southern states of America was at its most virulent. He beat Canadian Tommy Burns in a world title fight in 1908 and followed this with victory over America's \"great white hope\", Jim Jeffries, in 1910. But Johnson was reviled by the American and British public alike. </p> <p>His victories had brought a new racial dimension to boxing, and had roused the wrath of the white supremacists, who recognised their significance. What was still more infuriating for white Americans was Johnson's cocky attitude both inside and outside the ring. He taunted opponents with abuse and racial slurs, and also had a penchant for courting white women - in fact, he married three.</p> <p>This flaunting of unwritten colour codes made his victories over white men both physically and sexually humiliating to them. Despite condemnation of Johnson's street-fighter tactics and of bouts that the press called \"freak shows\", there was no shortage of takers for ringside seats or for tickets to see his motion pictures (the turn-of-the-century equivalent of pay-per-view). The crowd's love-hate relationship with Johnson was good for the box office, and his brawling and abusive manner, combined with white vitriol, merely added to the high-risk entertainment. When Johnson skipped a jail sentence for abducting a white woman, by escaping to Europe, the British press met him with the same vehemence bestowed on Tyson when he returned to the ring after serving time for rape, and again after biting another boxer's ear. In the cases of both Johnson and Tyson, the press demonised the fighters and, in defence of the principles of pugilism, called for them to be banned from boxing. If nothing has been learned in the 90 years that separates their careers, perhaps something can be gained from examining Johnson's experience in Paris. </p> <p>Paris's reception for Jack Johnson was different. Boxing had been introduced to French culture after the 1789 Revolution through an anglophile sporting society. Despite its English origins, the revival of \"la boxe\", as the French called it, came to Paris via America, and was associated with fairground and circus attractions. Black men who participated in boxing events were feted for their feats of strength and likened to their African brothers. These \"bad niggers\" were greeted with fascination and curiosity. Unlike America, Paris posed no restriction to their fighting with white men, and after 1900 many black boxers gravitated to the city in search of title fights. Johnson came to Paris in 1913 and participated in a number of boxing exhibitions organised by the Nouveau Cirque. </p> <p>Although race difference provided the visible tensions to Johnson's fights, the invisible political and sexual tensions that his male physicality established in the ring were equally potent. In America, his flamboyant character and transgressive behaviour outside the ring roused white fears of violation and depredation. But in Paris, a city proud of its liberal race policies, the challenge to political and sexual issues was not always so blatant. In the relationship that avant-garde Paris established with black people at this time, sexuality was implicit rather than explicit. That said, the courtship of black culture by the Parisian avant-garde was an even greater slap in the face of the bourgeoisie and its values than a fist fight in the ring. Johnson was vilified by the French mainstream because he challenged its values; he was admired by the avant-garde for the same reason. </p> <p>Why France should have proved more welcoming to black people than America or Britain is a complex question that necessitates an examination of its ultural and moral attitude towards them in history. Since the Revolution, the motto of \"Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9\" had helped to fashion a response to Africa, slavery and colonial rule that stressed an assimilation and accommodation of black culture (albeit a stifling one) within France's own sense of imperial destiny.</p> <p>French interest in their colonised peoples went beyond economic considerations. In addition to mainstream patronage and a colonial mission to \"improve\" black people, the avant-garde's admiration and borrowing of Negro forms was as much to satisfy its own need for the \"exotic\" and the \"real\" (something that was lacking in its own culture) as it was economic exploitation. The allure of black culture was that it stood for a spiritual wholeness that had been obscured in an increasingly \"civilised\" and mechanised environment by material development. The assimilation of black forms into Parisian subculture was remedial and therapeutic. </p> <p>The artistic climate of 20s Paris was a sensitive and experimental one, mirrored in its eclectic range of styles. The first flush of African art's influence on the Parisian avant-garde in the prewar years developed after the war into a commercialised version of \"all things African\", a sort of blackened version of Art Deco that debuted at the Exhibition of Decorative Arts in Paris in 1925. This \"black deco\" cousin was soon applied decoratively to many areas of Parisian lifestyle: furniture was embellished with animal skins and African designs; clothing stressed natural textiles and jungle pelts; jewellery boasted precious metals, gems and enamelling with jazzy contemporary designs. Black deco gradually settled into a style ripe for marketing, and black juxtaposed with white became the vogue. </p> <p>But Paris's infatuation with blackness was not just about aesthetics and inanimate objects: bohemian Parisians also fell in love with \"living\" black individuals, who were celebrated for their entertaining remedies to the ailments of modern life. This was certainly the case for the black female entertainer, Josephine Baker, Paris's own V\u00e9nus noire and the predecessor of female performers such as Eartha Kitt and Grace Jones, who have also played on white fantasies of animal magnetism to further their careers.</p> <p>As a talented black woman, \"La Bakaire\" enjoyed Paris because of the increased opportunities it gave her to realise herself and her goals. Of course, she did achieve great fame, and was even awarded the L\u00e9gion d'Honneur for her resistance work during the second world war. But despite her humanitarian concerns, she discovered that the admiration and success she gained from white society came at a cost. Even up to her death in 1975, at the age of 69, she remained typecast, singing and dancing a white man's tune. </p> <p>Yet when Baker first hit Paris as a young, Harlem-based dancer mimicking the vaudeville act of \"Bert &amp; Bennie\" at the Cotton Club, it seemed that within days she had all of the city's beau monde worshipping at her feet. Her cavorting and frenetic dancing quickly earned her a spotlight in Andr\u00e9 Daven's La Revue N\u00e8gre at the Th\u00e9tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, and her willingness to pose naked for the poster artist Paul Colin and to dance topless on stage transformed her into the mythical \"black Venus\". On opening night, when she was dressed solely in a ring of bananas belted across her hip, her expressive writhing, combined with drum beats, roused the audience. Her highly sexualised performance, with frenzied and exotic dancing in a duet choreographed by Daven, played upon her viewers' fantasies about Africa and black women. Despite its obvious fabrication, they were willingly seduced into accepting its authenticity. </p> <p>Present in the audience on Baker's debut night were the artists Francis Picabia and Kees van Dongen and the writers Blaise Cendrars and Robert Desnos; in the following months and years, other artists and writers, including Picasso, Foujita, Henri Laurens, Georges Rouault, Marie Laurencin, Louis Aragon and Alexander Calder, and architects such as Le Corbusier and Adolf Loos would seek her out as model and muse. </p> <p>For most artists, Baker was a romantic fantasy from a Gauguin or Rousseau painting come to life. Jean Dunand painted her in an exotic setting of banana and coconut trees dressed in skimpy stylised African dress and holding an African charm. Calder devoted his first completely wire-framed sculpture to a figure of Baker, the basis of a later mobile that hung from the ceiling echoing her \"dance de ventre\". In an era when artists were grappling with a polarised view of women that embraced both the creative and the subversive, Baker was an icon of female sexual expression. Her image was a powerful one, because she appeared to have liberated her female sexuality, and also because her blackness and the fantasy of her accessibility threw into contradiction social mores regarding both sex and race. </p> <p>Animal imagery dominated Baker's personality and performances, and these were caricatures that she herself fostered. Initially, her performances were full of playful leaping, tumbling and acrobatics that her viewers associated with monkeys, kangaroos and feline creatures, but as she grew more aware of the needs of her audience, her imagery became more sophisticated and symbolic. She paraded her pet leopard, Chiquita, as though it were an extension of her wardrobe, kept a menagerie of animals in her nightclub, Chez Jos\u00e9phine, and cultivated an animal-like presence to her sexuality. These signifiers were immediately apparent to viewers weaned on tales of contemporary African expeditions, such as the \"La Croisi\u00e8re noire\" mission of 1925, and notions of exotic black tribeswomen living naked in the wild. Baker's ability to actualise these fantasies made them appear real to Europeans, and merely served to perpetuate a stereotypical imagery that still today places judgments on young black women such as Venus and Serena Williams. </p> <p> Like Baker, the black people who found themselves in Paris were courted for their sense of style and vitality. Some were discharged soldiers not wishing to return to North America's racial restrictions. Others were musicians and entertainers such as Baker and the Revue Noir troop who found that white interest in dances such as the charleston, lindy hop, black bottom and shimmy could earn them a significant income, so they stayed. Ada \"Bricktop\" Smith, black singer and club owner whose popularity at times rivalled Baker's, made good money teaching \"white bottoms\" such as Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway to charleston; she even tutored the Prince of Wales. No social evening was complete without black musicians and dancers, and by the end of the decade both Montparnasse and Montmartre boasted black communities of entertainers and nightclubs. </p> <p>Montmartre, which, as now, was renowned for its nightlife, was the area to which most black visitors gravitated. This was the quarter for clubs such as Zelli's, Le Grand Duc, Bricktop's, Chez Florence and Chez Jos\u00e9phine, which were fronted by black stars but more regularly funded by white patrons. These botes featured both jazz and Latin music that, in spite of rigid opening laws, still managed to party until dawn. The trend for most jazz fans was to begin revelling in one club and then to \"cruise\" for the rest of the night in search of the hottest spots and entertainers. </p> <p>The musicians who worked these clubs initially came to Europe with shows such as Arthur Lyon's Chocolate Kiddies in Berlin, and Paris's La Revue N\u00e8gre and the Blackbirds, but the demand for performers meant that they could quickly make names for themselves. Clarinet player Sidney Bechet, after recording and playing in Harlem with great performers such as Bessie Smith, Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong, found fame in Paris after sailing to Europe in a \"cattle boat\" as part of the Southern Syncopated orchestra in 1919. Within weeks of the band performing at the Royal Philharmonic Hall, he was singled out for a royal command performance for King George V at Buckingham Palace. London, however, proved too restrictive for Bechet, and he was eventually deported to New York after narrowly escaping criminal charges for molesting a \"tart\" in Clapham. When he next returned to Europe, it was to Paris, where he achieved celebrity status alongside others such as piano player Noble Sissle, trumpeter Tommy Ladnier, and singers Florence Mills and Adelaide Hall. </p> <p>Not all blacks people in Paris were hustlers or entertainers, however. Some were privileged even before they came to Europe and pioneered the cause of a black intelligentsia in Europe. Despite Paris's reputation for modernity, some of the black artists working in the city, such as Lois Mailou Jones, Palmer Hayden and Henry O Tanner, were more inclined towards academicism. The same might also be said of African-American poets living there. Writers such as Countee Cullen, Claude McKay, Langston Hughes and Alain Locke may have framed their ideas about the Harlem Renaissance's New Negro within the modernist experience, but they were still remarkably conventional. </p> <p>The initial presence of blacks in Paris was considered rejuvenating, particularly for the bohemian set who cultivated the shadowy world of the jazz clubs and who called themselves \"negrophiles\" - figures such as the poet Guillaume Apollinaire, the art dealer Paul Guillaume, the shipping heiress and publisher Nancy Cunard, and the surrealist critic Michel Leiris. A few of these were even willing to disown their European heritage altogether in favour of black culture. </p> <p>Despite the negative historical implications of being called a \"nigger lover\", they used terms such as \"n\u00e9grophile\" and \"n\u00e9grier\" almost as terms of endearment to establish their status outside \"civilised\" society's moral boundaries. Being called a negrophile within the Parisian avant-garde affirmed one's defiant craze for black culture. \"Blackness\" was a sign of their modernity, reflected in the African sculptures that scattered their rooms alongside abstract paintings. Such orchestrated environments of tribal and modern became part of an invisible code that, rather like the decor of Dr Frasier Crane's apartment, defined their owners as cultured. </p> <p>Nancy Cunard epitomised the negrophile of the 20s, one of the elite who inherited the avant-garde enthusiasm for black culture. Her friendships between 1923 and 1925 with artists such as Tristan Tzara, Constantin Brancusi, Man Ray and Louis Aragon might have resulted in an approach to Africa based on the surrealists' fantasies of regression. Her commitment to authenticity, however, eventually introduced her to a network of black intellectuals and artists who ensured that her understanding of Africa was anti-colonial, if not a little transgressive. By 1926, she could write to her colleague Janet Flanner that she was leaving for Southampton \"to look for African and Oceanic things - because that is the most recent and now very large interest in my life, ivory, gods, masks, fetishes\". </p> <p>One image of Cunard photographed by Man Ray in 1926 defines her negrophile status. Pictured sporting bangles up to her elbows, mock leopard garb and eyes ringed with kohl, she exudes the exotic. Her stylish references separate her from conventions of refinement, yet curiously her refinement is reinforced by her accessories. Read like a shorthand for the \"exotic\" during this period, they were intended to enhance and to compliment her whiteness. Nevertheless, Cunard's predilection for Negro forms went beyond the mere sporting of fashion accessories. By 1928 she had left her lover Aragon for the black musician Henry Crowder, an affair that was later the cause of her disinheritance and estrangement from the Cunard family. Although the press maliciously reported other casual relationships with black men such as the actor Paul Robeson, suggesting that her interest was just a \"phase\" rather than a real commitment, her subsequent tireless work as editor of the black anthology, Negro, reflected a genuine need and concern to identify with and to support black people. Significantly, Cunard's career as an activist for black causes lasted the entire negrophilia era and beyond: the eventual publication of Negro in 1934 coincided with the end of the craze. The anthology took years to come to fruition, but it remains one of few tangible products from an era that proved so fickle and ephemeral. </p> <p>Ephemeral that period may have been, but in the world of black and white little changes, and negrophilia endures to this day. Assessment of historical relationships offers a useful guide for understanding contemporary issues, and one can often glide between past and present in a way that is frightening, but thought-provoking. </p> <p>This summer has been particularly rewarding, because so many black sports stars, such as the Williams sisters, Mike Tyson and Lennox Lewis, have been in the limelight, with the press dragging out all the old expressions they seem to reserve for black subjects. Sports reports describing the new Wimbledon and US Open champion Venus Williams as a \"demented doe\" or a \"predator\", along with descriptions of her \"impossibly long legs\" and \"octopus-like arms\", demonstrate that even as black athletes are winning, they are still perceived in a particular, patronising way by white people. </p> <p>When Tyson recently beat the sense out of his white Texan opponent Lou Savarese, for instance, broadsheet and tabloid newspapers alike expressed outrage at his conduct. The 38-second whipping he gave Savarese shocked those watching, as did the accidental lick which toppled the referee. But the media generally focused on the ringside interview held immediately after the fight, during which Tyson hesitatingly pieced together his view of the contest, but then, suddenly conscious of the camera, seemed to go into overdrive. He declared himself ready to fight Britain's double world champion Lewis and threatened to rip out his heart and to \"eat his babies\". </p> <p>Repulsed, the British press called Tyson \"tawdry\", \"mad\" and ready for \"the nuthouse\". With his actions and words, Tyson may have exacerbated negative stereotypes of blacks, but it was revealing to see how the media, in its reaction to the outburst, drew on pervasive notions of violence and deviance that historically have been related not just to boxers but to blacks in general. </p> <p>Today, in a shrinking world, black culture informs a wider, global popular culture. Black music and fashion are particularly seductive. The black image in movies, magazines, videos and computer games is now an icon of modernity. But even as it is being lucratively marketed worldwide, there is still discussion about its \"negative\" influences, as the Tyson case shows. </p> <p>Perhaps to redress this imbalance, in Britain we are witnessing another swing of the pendulum back towards negrophilia, especially when the subject is media-friendly - the successful promotion of Zadie Smith and her novel White Teeth, for instance, seemed as much to do with interest in the author's mixed-race upbringing and striking good looks as the book's witty commentary about the changing face of Britain.</p> <p>Today's negrophilia is especially indulgent of black Britons who are willing to carry the flag in their endeavours. Perhaps as a sign of its tolerance and multiculturalism, the media has begun to look more closely at these black people as individuals. Recently, the press has adopted Lennox Lewis as one of its own and has framed him, at least in the boxing arena, as \"Britain's last hope for glory\". It is intriguing that Lewis is being billed as a \"gentle giant\" in contrast to Tyson's monstrousness, and that Lewis's relative civility in the ring is being seen as an aspect of his Britishness, rather than of his Canadian-ness or Jamaican-ness. This colouring of Britishness is a relatively new phenomenon. It will be interesting to see if the current wave of negrophilia will be sustained beyond the ring and the final count </p> <p>\u00a9 Petrine Archer-Straw, 2000.

      "bodyText": "For almost 20 years, I have considered myself a student of \"negrophilia\". This means that I spend much of my time scrutinising how white and black people relate to each other, trying especially to understand their attraction to each other. My scrutiny can be quite personal, focusing on how I, as a black woman, interact with others around me, particularly when I am working in England; but my exploration is also often stimulated by my time in Jamaica, where the legacy of colonialism has ensured that race relations are a constant touchstone of Caribbean existence. Sometimes, my interests are voyeuristic, and I find myself spying on mixed-race couples and wondering how they perceive each other; at other times, I have a more critical attitude, trying to grasp why, and how, European history has often, implicitly or explicitly, tended to denigrate the image and psyche of black people. My initial interest in negrophilia grew out of my studies in art history. I came to the subject via what modern artists in the early decades of the 20th century called \"primitivism\". The term \"negrophilia\" itself describes the craze for black culture that was prevalent among avant-garde artists and bohemian types in 20s Paris, when to collect African art, to listen to black music and to dance with black people was a sign of being modern and fashionable. In the same way that, today, aspects of black culture such as hip hop, reggae, gangsta rap, locks and Afro hairstyles proliferate, in the 20s the craze was for dances such as the charleston, the lindy hop and the black bottom, for Bakerfix hair paste, and for wearing African-inspired clothes and accessories. This passion for black culture and a \"primitivised\" existence flourished in the aftermath of the first world war, when artists yearned for a simpler, idyllic lifestyle to counter modern life's mechanistic violence. But, even as the \"negrophiles\" of 20s Paris affirmed a love of black people, their relationships with them demonstrated, at least covertly, sentiments closer to fear - sentiments that still persist to this day. Black personalities were eitherlionised or demonised in a manner that denied normality. I felt that an examination of these mood swings from negrophilia to negrophobia might be a useful way to see how black people have historically become objects of affection or derision, and continue to be. Negrophilia is thus about western culture exploring its perceptions of difference in such a way that best reflects white people rather than their exoticised subjects. Such reflections are often highlighted in sport, the arts and popular entertainment, but they are particularly evident in boxing, a sport of extremes where, historically, whites and blacks have chosen controlled abuse to deal with each other. Fights between white and black boxers create interest because they provide an arena in which the myth of black savagery can be explored and confirmed and even supported. Boxing's ritualised order makes it possible for savage and civilised to meet and to challenge each other on equal terms, and sometimes to upset the \"natural\" order of things. The similarities between the career of Mike Tyson at the end of the 20th century and that of Jack Johnson, his black predecessor by almost 100 years, are remarkable and instructive, especially when used to compare attitudes and tolerance to race in America and Europe. Johnson, a Texan-born fighter, boxed his way to the heavyweight championship at a time when racial tension in the southern states of America was at its most virulent. He beat Canadian Tommy Burns in a world title fight in 1908 and followed this with victory over America's \"great white hope\", Jim Jeffries, in 1910. But Johnson was reviled by the American and British public alike. His victories had brought a new racial dimension to boxing, and had roused the wrath of the white supremacists, who recognised their significance. What was still more infuriating for white Americans was Johnson's cocky attitude both inside and outside the ring. He taunted opponents with abuse and racial slurs, and also had a penchant for courting white women - in fact, he married three. This flaunting of unwritten colour codes made his victories over white men both physically and sexually humiliating to them. Despite condemnation of Johnson's street-fighter tactics and of bouts that the press called \"freak shows\", there was no shortage of takers for ringside seats or for tickets to see his motion pictures (the turn-of-the-century equivalent of pay-per-view). The crowd's love-hate relationship with Johnson was good for the box office, and his brawling and abusive manner, combined with white vitriol, merely added to the high-risk entertainment. When Johnson skipped a jail sentence for abducting a white woman, by escaping to Europe, the British press met him with the same vehemence bestowed on Tyson when he returned to the ring after serving time for rape, and again after biting another boxer's ear. In the cases of both Johnson and Tyson, the press demonised the fighters and, in defence of the principles of pugilism, called for them to be banned from boxing. If nothing has been learned in the 90 years that separates their careers, perhaps something can be gained from examining Johnson's experience in Paris. Paris's reception for Jack Johnson was different. Boxing had been introduced to French culture after the 1789 Revolution through an anglophile sporting society. Despite its English origins, the revival of \"la boxe\", as the French called it, came to Paris via America, and was associated with fairground and circus attractions. Black men who participated in boxing events were feted for their feats of strength and likened to their African brothers. These \"bad niggers\" were greeted with fascination and curiosity. Unlike America, Paris posed no restriction to their fighting with white men, and after 1900 many black boxers gravitated to the city in search of title fights. Johnson came to Paris in 1913 and participated in a number of boxing exhibitions organised by the Nouveau Cirque. Although race difference provided the visible tensions to Johnson's fights, the invisible political and sexual tensions that his male physicality established in the ring were equally potent. In America, his flamboyant character and transgressive behaviour outside the ring roused white fears of violation and depredation. But in Paris, a city proud of its liberal race policies, the challenge to political and sexual issues was not always so blatant. In the relationship that avant-garde Paris established with black people at this time, sexuality was implicit rather than explicit. That said, the courtship of black culture by the Parisian avant-garde was an even greater slap in the face of the bourgeoisie and its values than a fist fight in the ring. Johnson was vilified by the French mainstream because he challenged its values; he was admired by the avant-garde for the same reason. Why France should have proved more welcoming to black people than America or Britain is a complex question that necessitates an examination of its ultural and moral attitude towards them in history. Since the Revolution, the motto of \"Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9\" had helped to fashion a response to Africa, slavery and colonial rule that stressed an assimilation and accommodation of black culture (albeit a stifling one) within France's own sense of imperial destiny. French interest in their colonised peoples went beyond economic considerations. In addition to mainstream patronage and a colonial mission to \"improve\" black people, the avant-garde's admiration and borrowing of Negro forms was as much to satisfy its own need for the \"exotic\" and the \"real\" (something that was lacking in its own culture) as it was economic exploitation. The allure of black culture was that it stood for a spiritual wholeness that had been obscured in an increasingly \"civilised\" and mechanised environment by material development. The assimilation of black forms into Parisian subculture was remedial and therapeutic. The artistic climate of 20s Paris was a sensitive and experimental one, mirrored in its eclectic range of styles. The first flush of African art's influence on the Parisian avant-garde in the prewar years developed after the war into a commercialised version of \"all things African\", a sort of blackened version of Art Deco that debuted at the Exhibition of Decorative Arts in Paris in 1925. This \"black deco\" cousin was soon applied decoratively to many areas of Parisian lifestyle: furniture was embellished with animal skins and African designs; clothing stressed natural textiles and jungle pelts; jewellery boasted precious metals, gems and enamelling with jazzy contemporary designs. Black deco gradually settled into a style ripe for marketing, and black juxtaposed with white became the vogue. But Paris's infatuation with blackness was not just about aesthetics and inanimate objects: bohemian Parisians also fell in love with \"living\" black individuals, who were celebrated for their entertaining remedies to the ailments of modern life. This was certainly the case for the black female entertainer, Josephine Baker, Paris's own V\u00e9nus noire and the predecessor of female performers such as Eartha Kitt and Grace Jones, who have also played on white fantasies of animal magnetism to further their careers. As a talented black woman, \"La Bakaire\" enjoyed Paris because of the increased opportunities it gave her to realise herself and her goals. Of course, she did achieve great fame, and was even awarded the L\u00e9gion d'Honneur for her resistance work during the second world war. But despite her humanitarian concerns, she discovered that the admiration and success she gained from white society came at a cost. Even up to her death in 1975, at the age of 69, she remained typecast, singing and dancing a white man's tune. Yet when Baker first hit Paris as a young, Harlem-based dancer mimicking the vaudeville act of \"Bert &amp; Bennie\" at the Cotton Club, it seemed that within days she had all of the city's beau monde worshipping at her feet. Her cavorting and frenetic dancing quickly earned her a spotlight in Andr\u00e9 Daven's La Revue N\u00e8gre at the Th\u00e9tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, and her willingness to pose naked for the poster artist Paul Colin and to dance topless on stage transformed her into the mythical \"black Venus\".

Perhaps to redress this imbalance, in Britain we are witnessing another swing of the pendulum back towards negrophilia, especially when the subject is media-friendly - the successful promotion of Zadie Smith and her novel White Teeth, for instance, seemed as much to do with interest in the author's mixed-race upbringing and striking good looks as the book's witty commentary about the changing face of Britain. Today's negrophilia is especially indulgent of black Britons who are willing to carry the flag in their endeavours. Perhaps as a sign of its tolerance and multiculturalism, the media has begun to look more closely at these black people as individuals. Recently, the press has adopted Lennox Lewis as one of its own and has framed him, at least in the boxing arena, as \"Britain's last hope for glory\". It is intriguing that Lewis is being billed as a \"gentle giant\" in contrast to Tyson's monstrousness, and that Lewis's relative civility in the ring is being seen as an aspect of his Britishness, rather than of his Canadian-ness or Jamaican-ness. This colouring of Britishness is a relatively new phenomenon. It will be interesting to see if the current wave of negrophilia will be sustained beyond the ring and the final count \u00a9 Petrine Archer-Straw, 2000. Negrophilia, by Petrine Archer-Straw, is published by Thames &amp; Hudson, priced \u00a314.95.",

Busy scratching a living selling crack to rent-boys and runaways in the back streets of Melbourne, Panther is approached by Father Corrigan, who wants to hunt down whichever psycho decided the crucifix in his church wasn't crowded enough and nailed a street kid over the top. Of course, Corrigan doesn't know that Joe is really Jesus; nor does he know he's hiring a detective who has literally seen it all before and can come back to life three days after being killed, guaranteed. Beautifully written, frighteningly erudite and utterly blasphemous, The Last Days mixes Australian urban noir, kick-boxing bodyguards and satanic conspiracy. </p> <p>Mary Gentle's <strong> Ash </strong> (Gollancz, \u00a320/\u00a314.99) is also excellent. A history of early renaissance Europe as it didn't happen (at least not in this timeline), in this world the Visigoths kept north Africa, Burgundy is the most powerful state in Christendom and Ash, the foul-mouthed leader of a mercenary band, is Joan of Arc without the virginity or the pious attitude. Raped as a child, Ash begins to hear voices that let her win battles - but hearing voices isn't a good thing in a world where the Church burns heretics. Told in emails, memos and modern translations of centuries-old papers, this is really a book about the quantum relationship between history and present-day evidence. The cover is dreadful and it's a questionable decision to bring Ash out in one volume rather than four (as is happening in the US), but the book is an elegantly written tour de force by someone who knows their history and isn't afraid to mess with it. </p> <p>There's no doubt that Greg Egan writes killer short stories; some of them, like his classic \"Our Lady of Chernobyl\", set standards of their own. However, his novels can lack bite - which is certainly the case with <strong> Teranesia </strong> (Millennium, \u00a35.99). After a childhood spent on an idyllic desert island, Prabir Suresh precipitates a disaster that finds him suddenly responsible for his small sister Maddy and living in Canada. Years on, rumours of strange new species draw biologist Maddy back to the island where her parents once studied mutation in butterflies, and a guilt-ridden Prabir follows after her. As ever, Egan's real strength is making the excitement of science understandable to non-scientists, but too much space is given over to easy targets. PhDs in X-Files theory, Diana studies, tabloid television - anyone can knock down these kinds of straw men. </p> <p>Orson Scott Card's <strong> Ender's Shadow </strong> (Orbit, \u00a36.99) is a parallax novel, taking place in the same world, at the same time and with many of the same characters as his 1985 Ender's Game . Only this time the bug-fighting hero is Bean, who we meet as a starving, hyper- intelligent, four-year-old street kid dictating tactics to a nine-year-old Rotterdam gang boss who's just had her food stolen by a 12-year-old prostitute. Dragged off to battle school, Bean ends up as shadow to Ender Wiggin, hero of the original. The overall story is not going to surprise anyone who's read the earlier book, but it's a good romp, if you can stand the moralising and suspend disbelief. </p> <p>Casting your main character as an apprentice torturer might make most publishers weep, but Gene Wolfe pulled it off in his New Sun series. The first book, <strong> Shadow of the Torturer</strong>, is now reissued with book two in one volume by Millennium (\u00a37.99).

      "body": "<p><strong> The Invention of the Restaurant: Paris and Modern Gastronomy</strong> <br> Rebecca L Spang<br> 324pp, Harvard<br> \u00a323.50 <br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502388209,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a> <br></p> <p> Mon dieu, but this is revisionist history. No more fables about ancien r\u00e9gime chefs, whose aristo patrons had been guillotined or exiled in the French Revolution, founding bistros to feed sans-culottes; an end to those anecdotes about their invention of dishes broiled on a breastplate on some Napoleonic battlefield. </p> <p>Because Spang reveals the restaurant's first true author: Mathurin Roze de Chantoiseau, \"friend of all the world\", an entrepreneur who edited an annual business directory in which he recommended himself as the \"king's restaurateur\" and founder of the first \"house of health\". Its premises opened in 1766 in the rue Saint Honor\u00e9, and were utterly unlike any previous comestibles sales point in Paris: not classifiable with cookshops, caterers, caf\u00e9s, cabarets, inns or the public \"host's table\" where, for a fixed fee and only at fixed hours, travellers and other kitchenless hungry mouths fought over communal dishes of pot-au-feu, pt\u00e9 and veg. </p> <p>Roze catered to a new trade in palates, inspired by age-of-Enlightenment scientific enquiry and a Rousseauesque concern with individual emotion that later produced the Romantic movement. No, honestly: both those zeitgeists influenced his very nouvelle cuisine. Roze and his followers adopted from the scientists a digestive language of \"phlogistons\" fermenting balefully in the gut as a response to heavy eating, particularly of meat; and of bouillons, long-simmered, thin quintessences of many carnal proteins that were promoted as a medical preparation in lieu of lumbering repasts. Chic stockpots ladled out the restoratives, or restaurants, source of the name. </p> <p>From Jean-Jacques Rousseau, the era's creative consultant, Roze borrowed the concept of sensibility - the idea that the highest humans were persons of feeling, sensitive of soul, who had \"visceral responses to any and all stimuli\" - nervous physical reactions to \"beautiful sunsets, resolute orphans, Roman ruins\" or a lump of roast duck plonked on the common table at the second sitting for dinner. Truly precious Parisian souls proved their superior weak chests by sipping a teeny porcelain bowl of consomm\u00e9 at late hours instead of munching a hearty evening meal with the morons. At a restaurant, the delicate could also toy with other delicacies of quasi-dairy simplicity derived from reading Rousseau, such as \"Breton porridge\" - clearly the polenta of its period - \"orange-flower-flavoured rice creams, semolina, fruit, fresh eggs, butter and cream cheeses\". All of these could be served in individual portions on demand, and priced as such, without either short-order cooking or feast-scale dish-of- the-day preparation. </p> <p>The restaurant revolution outlasted the 1789 Revolution, surviving, as Spang argues, accusations of political association with royalty, luxury and gluttony: restaurants probably did more to change human behavioural habits than the fall of the Bastille. They necessitated a new kind of public space: a mirrored, chandeliered adaptation of the posing zones of a salon in a townhouse of quality, yet with separate, socially isolated tables for each diner or party (unprecedentedly, women ate in public in restaurants). For the first time, too, restaurants had servile front-of-house staff, with culinary scullions banished to kitchens invisible to diners (beginning a descent from healthfulness to the filthy Parisian hell in which George Orwell slung his nasty trays). They also offered a list of what might be consumed - Spang wickedly describes the history of the menu, which began as a single newspaper-like sheet with dense columns of miniscule print, then bellied out to a leather-covered book like \"a fat realist novel\", and finally slimmed down in the belle \u00e9poque to a hand-drawn daily poster. </p> <p>And restaurants produced the restaurant critic. Spang's most learned research brings us the first of these: the awesomely weird Alexandre Balthasar Laurent Grimod de la Reyni\u00e8re, \"the single most famous eater in First Empire France\". His gothick reputation dated from 1783, when as a rich but trade-connected lawyer he gave a supper party for 22 guests, sending them funereal invitations and requiring them to go through macabre entry rituals that no snobbish matre d' ever equalled.

      "bodyText": "The Invention of the Restaurant: Paris and Modern Gastronomy Rebecca L Spang 324pp, Harvard \u00a323.50 Buy it at BOL Mon dieu, but this is revisionist history. No more fables about ancien r\u00e9gime chefs, whose aristo patrons had been guillotined or exiled in the French Revolution, founding bistros to feed sans-culottes; an end to those anecdotes about their invention of dishes broiled on a breastplate on some Napoleonic battlefield. Because Spang reveals the restaurant's first true author: Mathurin Roze de Chantoiseau, \"friend of all the world\", an entrepreneur who edited an annual business directory in which he recommended himself as the \"king's restaurateur\" and founder of the first \"house of health\". Its premises opened in 1766 in the rue Saint Honor\u00e9, and were utterly unlike any previous comestibles sales point in Paris: not classifiable with cookshops, caterers, caf\u00e9s, cabarets, inns or the public \"host's table\" where, for a fixed fee and only at fixed hours, travellers and other kitchenless hungry mouths fought over communal dishes of pot-au-feu, pt\u00e9 and veg. Roze catered to a new trade in palates, inspired by age-of-Enlightenment scientific enquiry and a Rousseauesque concern with individual emotion that later produced the Romantic movement. No, honestly: both those zeitgeists influenced his very nouvelle cuisine. Roze and his followers adopted from the scientists a digestive language of \"phlogistons\" fermenting balefully in the gut as a response to heavy eating, particularly of meat; and of bouillons, long-simmered, thin quintessences of many carnal proteins that were promoted as a medical preparation in lieu of lumbering repasts. Chic stockpots ladled out the restoratives, or restaurants, source of the name. From Jean-Jacques Rousseau, the era's creative consultant, Roze borrowed the concept of sensibility - the idea that the highest humans were persons of feeling, sensitive of soul, who had \"visceral responses to any and all stimuli\" - nervous physical reactions to \"beautiful sunsets, resolute orphans, Roman ruins\" or a lump of roast duck plonked on the common table at the second sitting for dinner. Truly precious Parisian souls proved their superior weak chests by sipping a teeny porcelain bowl of consomm\u00e9 at late hours instead of munching a hearty evening meal with the morons. At a restaurant, the delicate could also toy with other delicacies of quasi-dairy simplicity derived from reading Rousseau, such as \"Breton porridge\" - clearly the polenta of its period - \"orange-flower-flavoured rice creams, semolina, fruit, fresh eggs, butter and cream cheeses\". All of these could be served in individual portions on demand, and priced as such, without either short-order cooking or feast-scale dish-of- the-day preparation. The restaurant revolution outlasted the 1789 Revolution, surviving, as Spang argues, accusations of political association with royalty, luxury and gluttony: restaurants probably did more to change human behavioural habits than the fall of the Bastille. They necessitated a new kind of public space: a mirrored, chandeliered adaptation of the posing zones of a salon in a townhouse of quality, yet with separate, socially isolated tables for each diner or party (unprecedentedly, women ate in public in restaurants). For the first time, too, restaurants had servile front-of-house staff, with culinary scullions banished to kitchens invisible to diners (beginning a descent from healthfulness to the filthy Parisian hell in which George Orwell slung his nasty trays). They also offered a list of what might be consumed - Spang wickedly describes the history of the menu, which began as a single newspaper-like sheet with dense columns of miniscule print, then bellied out to a leather-covered book like \"a fat realist novel\", and finally slimmed down in the belle \u00e9poque to a hand-drawn daily poster. And restaurants produced the restaurant critic. Spang's most learned research brings us the first of these: the awesomely weird Alexandre Balthasar Laurent Grimod de la Reyni\u00e8re, \"the single most famous eater in First Empire France\". His gothick reputation dated from 1783, when as a rich but trade-connected lawyer he gave a supper party for 22 guests, sending them funereal invitations and requiring them to go through macabre entry rituals that no snobbish matre d' ever equalled. They eventually ate with a coffin as a table centrepiece and a non-partaking audience of hundreds watching from a gallery - a parody of the royal rite of dining. After the Revolution, Grimod, self-styled \"Minister of the Maw\", became a hero, compiling best- selling editions of his Almanach Des Gourmands , in which he used the shape of the drama review as the basis of food criticism. Grimod's gastronomic judgments backed a change in restaurants from purveying beef tea to the emotionally overwhelmed to being the temples of the secular religion of gourmandising, under which France existed only in order to send its produce for Grimod's \"tasting jury\" - himself - to pronounce upon in Paris. The Almanach's extravagant language and foodie-centric attitudes may have been, Spang points out, Grimod's means of satirising the society of Napoleon's empire; he was able to evade censorship by concentrating on the perfect partridge pottage. Of all the people and establishments Spang reveals and revivifies through her fab book's droll humour, Grimod is the most vivid: his text \"devoured Paris\", and in perverse connoisseurship he recommended sucking a finger just inserted deep into the anus of a turkey to determine its freshness. Which, as Spang notes, is sad and mysterious, for - despite all his mentions of licking sauce from fingers - Grimod had no fingers. \"He was either born with webbed extremities, or ... as a small child had his hands gobbled off by a ravenous pig.\" AA Gill or Michael Winner, dining at London's coolest sashimi bar: how could you possibly live up to that?",

In him, the innate corruptibility of the office and the basic limitations of the man met in perfect, unholy synthesis. </p> <p>For a time he was able, through genuine political skill, to maintain a balancing act of plausible respectability: he escalated the war in Vietnam in order slowly to withdraw from it, and began a successful process of rapprochement with red China. But during the drawn-out soap opera of Watergate, the symbolism of the era he wanted so badly to dominate finally became overt - a symbolism that stretched beyond the particular flaws in Nixon's own divided character to a more profound (and profoundly perceived) inadequacy in the American political system itself. </p> <p>The lesson of the time was that politics was legalised crime, or crime by popular mandate. As the revelations of executive wrong-doing piled up, it was as if every dark and noxious thing that the Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy or Johnson administrations had done in secret and plotted to keep hidden was suddenly visible, like a breaking fever, in Nixon's sweaty face and hooded eyes, and in the bare-faced effrontery of his increasingly threadbare imperial pretensions. If you stripped from the country's recent leaders their humanising masks (Ike's lazy probity, Kennedy's glamour, LBJ's riverboat-gambler exuberance) you found the archetypal presidential face - Nixon's - staring back at you: petty, vengeful, mawkish and corrupt. </p> <p>It was Nixon's tragedy to destroy not merely himself but the office whose power and influence he so revered. What he did at Watergate broke the spell of the presidency, perhaps for good. The fact that his claim to be a substantial and effective leader had proved so hollow - that everything in his hardworking, small-town Quaker character appeared to have turned to bad as he clawed his way to supreme power - opened a window of suspicion in the American consciousness that has never closed. The nation sensed that the scandal was something more than an aberration, and there was a bruised and humiliating feeling that maybe the job itself was to blame. Nixon's fall was proof that, though the constitution worked, the presidency did not. </p> <p>Probably this is why there is still no satisfactory consensus as to his place in history. Hatred, especially among America's liberal eastern elite, remains deep, and the counter-cultural demonisation of him - which loathed his suits, cufflinks and haircut as violently as his politics - hasn't lost its aesthetic appeal. Yet, as Clinton effectively insisted when Nixon died, there's an ambivalence and hypocrisy in this, too: a child-like urge to scapegoat Nixon for what is partly a national failure, the failure of a multifarious society to resolve its own deep divisions and become what the onward-rushing rhetoric of its greatest men promised but could not deliver. </p> <p>Anthony Summers's new biography has real strengths, but it lacks the widening socio-historical perspective that could turn a life of this most contradictory of presidents into an expression of the polarised anxieties of his age. Presumably, this is why John Ehrlichman told Summers in advance that he hoped for \"a more solid history of that time\", since writing about Nixon really means writing a history of the 1950s and 1960s. Instead, Summers has settled for something more partisan and limited. </p> <p>Nixon was often a forensic politician, and Summers tackles him forensically, building the case against him item by item with legalistic skill and (occasionally) at irritatingly legalistic length. The result is a compelling piece of concentrated character assassination, honed scalpel-sharp, which leaves its subject convincingly compromised in virtually every aspect of his life and career. This Nixon is a lavishly repellent historical monster who could have come straight from the pages of Suetonius. He's all the dark and midnight things the hippies suspected but couldn't actually prove: a drunken, pill-popping, anally repressed wife-beater who consistently lied, embezzled and wiretapped both in office and out. His dirty tricks included involvement in plots by the CIA and organised crime to murder Fidel Castro, and the deliberate sabotage, for short-term electoral gain, of President Johnson's 1968 Vietnam peace initiative. It seems almost a pity, for poetic reasons, that he's not accused of complicity in the killing of Kennedy. </p> <p>Because one way to read Nixon is to see him as Kennedy's reverse image, or shadow likeness. Summers, who has written extensively and well on the evil undertow of Camelot, builds the Nixon melodrama from roughly the same cast of characters, with the same financially dissolute, Mob-influenced atmosphere. But his book ultimately becomes like Watergate itself, obsessed with scandalous detail and insufficiently sensitive to a larger, revelatory coherence in what is being described. After the prosecution of the supercilious Ivy League mandarin Alger Hiss, when the young Nixon made his name as anti-Communist dragon-slayer, his star witness and future friend Whittaker Chambers wrote: \"No feature of the Hiss case is more troubling than the fissure it did not so much open as reveal between the plain men and women of America, and those who affected to act, think and speak for them.\" </p> <p>Nixon and Kennedy exemplified this perfectly. Although both were political conservatives - sibling-close ideologically - they spoke, in the end, to utterly different constituencies and the era polarised around them. Nixon was a creature of the small towns and respectable suburbs: his public persona gratified their thrifty sense of grievance and exclusion. The internecine struggles of '68 - the conflicts of race, class and generation that swirled around the trauma of Vietnam - saw Nixon's America reaping what Kennedy's had sown, and an acrid smell of revenge hung in the tear-gassed air. Nixon took power ostensibly to heal, but emotionally to punish. </p> <p>Yet, despite its Prussian crew-cuts, the Nixon White House proved surprisingly liberal. Although the President could have cancelled the Great Society welfare programmes, in many cases he enlarged them. He reduced the proportion of the federal budget spent on defence and considerably increased funding for the arts, health and education. He set up the Environmental Protection Agency and put an end to the draft. Unemployment benefits were extended; social security benefits went up; there was a general widening of civil rights. There were also the long-lasting foreign-policy achievements of detente with Russia and China. This progressiveness is something Summers does not really address. Like many writers, he prefers the gangsterish Washington: Behind Closed Doors aspect of the subject. </p> <p>But what ruined Nixon wasn't Watergate or internal dissent or the horrors of Cambodia. It was his moral failure to do what he'd promised in his '68 victory speech, which was to bring the country together. History required a Lin coln or an FDR, but Nixon knew only how to be chief politician, not head of state. The trap the era sprung for him was one of cheap animosity, and he fell straight into it. Everything decent and enlightened he did administratively perished in the psychic agonies that his stubborn, unforgiving nature put the country through, from the shootings at Kent State, Ohio to the lachrymose non-apologies of his farewell press conference. </p> <p>Commentators saw Nixon's exit as something out of Shakespearean tragedy. It was closer to the dark farce of Twelfth Night , in which the humiliated, low-born Malvolio sweeps out, full of injured Puritan fury, vowing, somehow, to get back and get even. This attempt - which Summers's angry and hostile book resists so vigorously - is no doubt why we continue to feel that his driven, unquiet spirit is still alive, still running.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Arrogance of Power: The Secret World of Richard Nixon Anthony Summers with Robbyn Swann 640pp, Orion \u00a320 Buy it at BOL Of all the image-driven American presidents of the mid-20th century, Richard Nixon is the one who most closely resembles the portrait in Dorian Gray's attic. In him, the innate corruptibility of the office and the basic limitations of the man met in perfect, unholy synthesis. For a time he was able, through genuine political skill, to maintain a balancing act of plausible respectability: he escalated the war in Vietnam in order slowly to withdraw from it, and began a successful process of rapprochement with red China. But during the drawn-out soap opera of Watergate, the symbolism of the era he wanted so badly to dominate finally became overt - a symbolism that stretched beyond the particular flaws in Nixon's own divided character to a more profound (and profoundly perceived) inadequacy in the American political system itself. The lesson of the time was that politics was legalised crime, or crime by popular mandate. As the revelations of executive wrong-doing piled up, it was as if every dark and noxious thing that the Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy or Johnson administrations had done in secret and plotted to keep hidden was suddenly visible, like a breaking fever, in Nixon's sweaty face and hooded eyes, and in the bare-faced effrontery of his increasingly threadbare imperial pretensions. If you stripped from the country's recent leaders their humanising masks (Ike's lazy probity, Kennedy's glamour, LBJ's riverboat-gambler exuberance) you found the archetypal presidential face - Nixon's - staring back at you: petty, vengeful, mawkish and corrupt. It was Nixon's tragedy to destroy not merely himself but the office whose power and influence he so revered. What he did at Watergate broke the spell of the presidency, perhaps for good. The fact that his claim to be a substantial and effective leader had proved so hollow - that everything in his hardworking, small-town Quaker character appeared to have turned to bad as he clawed his way to supreme power - opened a window of suspicion in the American consciousness that has never closed. The nation sensed that the scandal was something more than an aberration, and there was a bruised and humiliating feeling that maybe the job itself was to blame. Nixon's fall was proof that, though the constitution worked, the presidency did not. Probably this is why there is still no satisfactory consensus as to his place in history. Hatred, especially among America's liberal eastern elite, remains deep, and the counter-cultural demonisation of him - which loathed his suits, cufflinks and haircut as violently as his politics - hasn't lost its aesthetic appeal. Yet, as Clinton effectively insisted when Nixon died, there's an ambivalence and hypocrisy in this, too: a child-like urge to scapegoat Nixon for what is partly a national failure, the failure of a multifarious society to resolve its own deep divisions and become what the onward-rushing rhetoric of its greatest men promised but could not deliver. Anthony Summers's new biography has real strengths, but it lacks the widening socio-historical perspective that could turn a life of this most contradictory of presidents into an expression of the polarised anxieties of his age. Presumably, this is why John Ehrlichman told Summers in advance that he hoped for \"a more solid history of that time\", since writing about Nixon really means writing a history of the 1950s and 1960s. Instead, Summers has settled for something more partisan and limited. Nixon was often a forensic politician, and Summers tackles him forensically, building the case against him item by item with legalistic skill and (occasionally) at irritatingly legalistic length. The result is a compelling piece of concentrated character assassination, honed scalpel-sharp, which leaves its subject convincingly compromised in virtually every aspect of his life and career. This Nixon is a lavishly repellent historical monster who could have come straight from the pages of Suetonius. He's all the dark and midnight things the hippies suspected but couldn't actually prove: a drunken, pill-popping, anally repressed wife-beater who consistently lied, embezzled and wiretapped both in office and out. His dirty tricks included involvement in plots by the CIA and organised crime to murder Fidel Castro, and the deliberate sabotage, for short-term electoral gain, of President Johnson's 1968 Vietnam peace initiative. It seems almost a pity, for poetic reasons, that he's not accused of complicity in the killing of Kennedy. Because one way to read Nixon is to see him as Kennedy's reverse image, or shadow likeness. Summers, who has written extensively and well on the evil undertow of Camelot, builds the Nixon melodrama from roughly the same cast of characters, with the same financially dissolute, Mob-influenced atmosphere. But his book ultimately becomes like Watergate itself, obsessed with scandalous detail and insufficiently sensitive to a larger, revelatory coherence in what is being described. After the prosecution of the supercilious Ivy League mandarin Alger Hiss, when the young Nixon made his name as anti-Communist dragon-slayer, his star witness and future friend Whittaker Chambers wrote: \"No feature of the Hiss case is more troubling than the fissure it did not so much open as reveal between the plain men and women of America, and those who affected to act, think and speak for them.\" Nixon and Kennedy exemplified this perfectly. Although both were political conservatives - sibling-close ideologically - they spoke, in the end, to utterly different constituencies and the era polarised around them. Nixon was a creature of the small towns and respectable suburbs: his public persona gratified their thrifty sense of grievance and exclusion. The internecine struggles of '68 - the conflicts of race, class and generation that swirled around the trauma of Vietnam - saw Nixon's America reaping what Kennedy's had sown, and an acrid smell of revenge hung in the tear-gassed air. Nixon took power ostensibly to heal, but emotionally to punish. Yet, despite its Prussian crew-cuts, the Nixon White House proved surprisingly liberal. Although the President could have cancelled the Great Society welfare programmes, in many cases he enlarged them. He reduced the proportion of the federal budget spent on defence and considerably increased funding for the arts, health and education. He set up the Environmental Protection Agency and put an end to the draft. Unemployment benefits were extended; social security benefits went up; there was a general widening of civil rights. There were also the long-lasting foreign-policy achievements of detente with Russia and China. This progressiveness is something Summers does not really address. Like many writers, he prefers the gangsterish Washington: Behind Closed Doors aspect of the subject. But what ruined Nixon wasn't Watergate or internal dissent or the horrors of Cambodia. It was his moral failure to do what he'd promised in his '68 victory speech, which was to bring the country together. History required a Lin coln or an FDR, but Nixon knew only how to be chief politician, not head of state. The trap the era sprung for him was one of cheap animosity, and he fell straight into it. Everything decent and enlightened he did administratively perished in the psychic agonies that his stubborn, unforgiving nature put the country through, from the shootings at Kent State, Ohio to the lachrymose non-apologies of his farewell press conference. Commentators saw Nixon's exit as something out of Shakespearean tragedy. It was closer to the dark farce of Twelfth Night , in which the humiliated, low-born Malvolio sweeps out, full of injured Puritan fury, vowing, somehow, to get back and get even. This attempt - which Summers's angry and hostile book resists so vigorously - is no doubt why we continue to feel that his driven, unquiet spirit is still alive, still running.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>In Siberia</strong><br> Colin Thurbon<br> Penguin<br> \u00a37.99<br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501000166,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a> <br></p> <p> According to travel writer and novelist Colin Thubron, the publishing industry made an exciting discovery in the mid-1970s. \"They realised that travel writing could also be literature,\" he says, \"which was of course very fortunate for my generation. Paul Theroux, Bruce Chatwin, Jonathan Raban and myself were hyper-praised for a while. All that has now slightly faded, but I do think that travel writing is still in a healthy state.\" </p> <p>One of the key reasons the genre has remained so strong is that Thubron has continued to write travel books. He has published nine in all, as well as six novels. The latest book, In Siberia, gives a lyrical and learned account of this vast and mysterious region, and has again been praised as much for Thubron's literary talents as for his intrepid journeying to impenetrable locations. </p> <p>Looking at his CV, it seems he was always destined to marry a \"natural love of words\" with nomadic instincts. As the son of a soldier/diplomat, he travelled all over the world to meet up with his family during school holidays from Eton. He also has a literary pedigree, being a distant relative of the 17th century poet laureate John Dryden. \"My mother's maiden name was Dryden,\" he says, \"but he didn't have any immediate family so I'm more of a collateral descendant.\" At school Thubron remembers other boys reading Biggles or Bulldog Drummond, while he always preferred to write \"bad poetry\". He then became a publisher, but treated his job as a staging post on his journey to becoming a writer. The career change was duly made when he took a year off to live in Damascus. </p> <p>\"I had been fascinated by the inland cities of Syria for years,\" he says. \"I suppose I chose Damascus as a subject partly because it had been so little written about. But it was a work of love, really. I had no idea whether anyone would publish it.\" He says that while he admired Freya Stark for \"the poetry of her writing\", and Patrick Leigh Fermor \"for the robustness of his descriptions\", it was a fascination for the places themselves that inspired him, not for the people who had written about them. He went on to write another three books about the eastern Mediterranean, and he also began to write fiction. </p> <p>His first published novel, The God in the Mountain, came in 1977 when Thubron was in his mid-thirties. He freely acknowledges that his fiction doesn't strike many people as the sort of thing a travel writer would produce. \"They are often set in enclosed places. I've used a mental hospital, a prison and inside someone's amnesiac head,\" he says. \"They are anti-travel books, if you like, but they give their voice to something in me that a travel book can't. In travel writing your principal fascination is with something outside yourself. With fiction you can much more give voice to your personal life, however heavily disguised, and to all sorts of inner feelings and compulsions.\" </p> <p>Having written about Cyprus, Jerusalem and the Lebanon, Thubron ventured further east in 1980 when he travelled around Brezhnev's Russia in a car for his book Among the Russians. He then went behind the bamboo curtain to explore China in Behind the Wall. \"I suppose one motive was that I wanted to approach those countries that we in the west had traditionally been brought up to fear: the Russian bear and the yellow peril. But while I wanted to go beyond journalistic clich\u00e9s, it wasn't an evangelical mission or anything like that. It was more instinct and a desire to satisfy my own curiosity. I wanted to humanise the map.\" </p> <p>It has been widely noted that Thubron doesn't push himself to the forefront of his own travel writing. \"One of the reasons I seem to retire a bit in the travel books is an anxiety not to push my prejudices too far,\" he explains. \"I do try to subdue or smother my prejudices, although I know you can't do this entirely.

      "bodyText": "In Siberia Colin Thurbon Penguin \u00a37.99 Buy it at BOL According to travel writer and novelist Colin Thubron, the publishing industry made an exciting discovery in the mid-1970s. \"They realised that travel writing could also be literature,\" he says, \"which was of course very fortunate for my generation. Paul Theroux, Bruce Chatwin, Jonathan Raban and myself were hyper-praised for a while. All that has now slightly faded, but I do think that travel writing is still in a healthy state.\" One of the key reasons the genre has remained so strong is that Thubron has continued to write travel books. He has published nine in all, as well as six novels. The latest book, In Siberia, gives a lyrical and learned account of this vast and mysterious region, and has again been praised as much for Thubron's literary talents as for his intrepid journeying to impenetrable locations. Looking at his CV, it seems he was always destined to marry a \"natural love of words\" with nomadic instincts. As the son of a soldier/diplomat, he travelled all over the world to meet up with his family during school holidays from Eton. He also has a literary pedigree, being a distant relative of the 17th century poet laureate John Dryden. \"My mother's maiden name was Dryden,\" he says, \"but he didn't have any immediate family so I'm more of a collateral descendant.\" At school Thubron remembers other boys reading Biggles or Bulldog Drummond, while he always preferred to write \"bad poetry\". He then became a publisher, but treated his job as a staging post on his journey to becoming a writer. The career change was duly made when he took a year off to live in Damascus. \"I had been fascinated by the inland cities of Syria for years,\" he says. \"I suppose I chose Damascus as a subject partly because it had been so little written about. But it was a work of love, really. I had no idea whether anyone would publish it.\" He says that while he admired Freya Stark for \"the poetry of her writing\", and Patrick Leigh Fermor \"for the robustness of his descriptions\", it was a fascination for the places themselves that inspired him, not for the people who had written about them. He went on to write another three books about the eastern Mediterranean, and he also began to write fiction. His first published novel, The God in the Mountain, came in 1977 when Thubron was in his mid-thirties. He freely acknowledges that his fiction doesn't strike many people as the sort of thing a travel writer would produce. \"They are often set in enclosed places. I've used a mental hospital, a prison and inside someone's amnesiac head,\" he says. \"They are anti-travel books, if you like, but they give their voice to something in me that a travel book can't. In travel writing your principal fascination is with something outside yourself. With fiction you can much more give voice to your personal life, however heavily disguised, and to all sorts of inner feelings and compulsions.\" Having written about Cyprus, Jerusalem and the Lebanon, Thubron ventured further east in 1980 when he travelled around Brezhnev's Russia in a car for his book Among the Russians. He then went behind the bamboo curtain to explore China in Behind the Wall. \"I suppose one motive was that I wanted to approach those countries that we in the west had traditionally been brought up to fear: the Russian bear and the yellow peril. But while I wanted to go beyond journalistic clich\u00e9s, it wasn't an evangelical mission or anything like that. It was more instinct and a desire to satisfy my own curiosity. I wanted to humanise the map.\" It has been widely noted that Thubron doesn't push himself to the forefront of his own travel writing. \"One of the reasons I seem to retire a bit in the travel books is an anxiety not to push my prejudices too far,\" he explains. \"I do try to subdue or smother my prejudices, although I know you can't do this entirely. You can't really ever pretend to be a disembodied voice of authority. This is particularly true in China. Our whole history and frame of mind is so different to that of China. It is impossible to shake the habits of western mind.\" When he went to Siberia he was interested to see how deeply the changes that have transformed the old Soviet Union had penetrated. \"This is the part of Russia that is most distant and least reported on, and I wanted to see how small communities were faring.

      "body": "<p><strong> Rimbaud</strong></p> <p> Graham Robb </p> <p>552pp, Picador</p> <p>\u00a320 <br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000000758,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a> <br></p> <p> Speculation concerning the extraordinary life and atrocious death of Jean Nicolas Arthur Rimbaud will never reach conclusion. Mention his name and the Carjat photograph showing that oval face with the shock of dark hair, the faraway look and the wilful, almost sulky mouth springs instantly to mind. Paul Verlaine, with the gaze of a lover, found a \"kind of sweetness\" that \"glimmered and smiled in those cruel, pale-blue eyes and on those powerful red lips with their acrimonious curl\". Verlaine's wife Mathilde recalled, many years after her dreadful humiliation, that \"his eyes were blue and rather beautiful, but they had a sly expression, which in our indulgence, we took for shyness\". Carjat himself, who suffered physical injury at his hands, came to call Rimbaud \"that little toad\". </p> <p>This view of Rimbaud as a satanic angel has perpetuated his legend. The extreme ambiguity of both his nature and his work guarantees that his image will be stencilled on walls, along with some of his gnomic utterances, for as long as a spirit of revolt remains alive. As Graham Robb comments in the introduction to this new biography: \"Rimbaud's abandonment of poetry in his early 20s has caused more lasting, widespread consternation than the break-up of the Beatles.\" He then goes on to list the poet's multiple incarnations, his avatars, his devotees, his groupies.</p> <p> A poem by Malcolm Lowry consists entirely of an enumeration of Rimbaud's identities, donned and doffed with bewildering rapidity and Olympian indifference. The list runs something like this: poet, factory worker, tutor, beggar, key-ring seller, docker, circus worker, quarry foreman, mercenary, trader, gun-runner, part-time commentator on the Koran. There is evidence, though it is hotly disputed, that he was, briefly, a slave-trader. His liaison with Verlaine ensures him heroic status as one of the founders of gay culture. In more general terms, he has been recruited by every vaguely anarchist movement going, from the Commune to the Beats by way of surrealism. He has focused the energies of Bob Dylan and Jim Morrison. As to his soul, opinions have differed. Paul Claudel, Catholic int\u00e9griste, called him \"an angelic mind that was certainly illuminated by heavenly light\"; for Edmond de Goncourt he was a \"pederast assassin\". </p> <p>Undeterred by this welter of conflicting witness, Robb has undertaken a new biography. With two hefty \"lives\" already behind him, a Balzac and a Victor Hugo, he continues, with Rimbaud, to annex great swathes of 19th-century French literature. It is an extraordinary achievement for someone just over 40. \"Oh mad Ambition,\" wrote the 15-year-old Rimbaud in a covering letter to Th\u00e9odore de Banville when sending him his first poems, and one might apply the same phrase to Graham Robb. But cast incredulity aside: Robb has written a great biography - scholarly, humane and above all marvellously entertaining. His concise, almost clipped style is the perfect antidote to the kind of gushing, impressionistic hagiography that is the scourge of Rimbaud studies. He is a master of the understatement and the witty aside. His knowledge of the period enables him to set the scene with the minimum of fuss. And although he is quite familiar with the academic disputes and squabbles that surround the work, to his great credit he does not get drawn down into those often dreary vortices. </p> <p>There is throughout a sense of putting facts straight. Critics, including previous biographers such as the venerable Enid Starkie, are quietly put right - often with a deal of wit, sometimes with a hint of impatience. Unravelling the murky history of Rimbaud's financial dealings and probable wealth during his African years, to take just one example, is a huge achievement on its own. Robb sets out to question every received idea about Rimbaud; he devotes as much attention to his post-poetic life as to his early years, with the result that the one throws steady light on the other. His previous biographical and academic work has prepared him for this task. It is surely a great insight to compare Balzac and Rimbaud - in their omnivorous desire for all kinds of knowledge, in their \"philomathic\" compulsions - given the prolixity of the one and the slender gleanings of the other. Superficially, they seem to be worlds apart. </p> <p>Perhaps the greatest deterrent to writing the life of Rimbaud is what the subject himself would have made of the whole enterprise. Toiling away under that scornful gaze must take nerves of steel. As everyone knows, Rimbaud had stopped any literary activity by his mid-twenties, and on the very rare occasions he referred to his previous life he dismissed his productions as \"rin\u00e7ures\" - roughly translatable as \"slops\" from the kitchen sink. \"A dog never goes back to its vomit\" is the sort of phrase Rimbaud would have approved. As for \"memoirs\" of any kind, the later Rimbaud held them in contempt. In one shocking episode (often omitted, according to Robb, in earlier biographies) Rimbaud unceremoniously burned the 34 volumes of \"memoirs\" written by Pierre Labatut, a fellow trader in Abyssinia. Labatut had recently died of cancer. Brandishing some spurious notice of distraint, Rimbaud raided his hut, where he found his distraught, cowering widow; confiscating everything he could find, he burned what was probably a unique document relating to French colonial history in the scramble for Africa. The sometime author of Une Saison en Enfer evidently had no time for another man's \"confessions\", as he derisively called them. Robb is devoted to his subject, but he is no gullible devotee. Unflinchingly he relates, or infers, other ugly episodes, which are often occluded. </p> <p>For example, when finding himself penniless in Germany, Rimbaud had no compunction about attempting to blackmail yet more money out of Verlaine by threatening to spread abroad rumours of his pederasty. Sex, it appears, like anarchist politics or poetry itself, was never more to \"the man with soles of wind\" than a means to an end. In the latter years, that end was almost exclusively financial. Or else his homosexuality was part and parcel of his \"immense and reasoned derangement of the senses\" - a way into those unknown dimensions he had proclaimed in his famous \"Lettre du Voyant\" or \"Seer's Manifesto\", which he dashed off in a letter when he was 16 and which has since become one of the \"sacred documents\" of modern literature. </p> <p>Poor Verlaine, the \"foolish virgin\" to Rimbaud's \"infernal bridegroom\", was the sacrificial lamb (or \"little boy\" or \"martyr\" or, practising his English, \"old cunt always open or opened\") to Rimbaud's \"programme\". Still married, terrified of disgrace, he was usually in two minds about it (and given the absinthe factor, sometimes in no mind at all). But the older poet had the grace to overlook the blackmail, and went on to describe his tormentor as possessing the kind of \"high disdain\" that never compromises or adheres to any system not of its own choosing. Mallarm\u00e9, along with Rimbaud the other great poet-thinker of the time, marvelled at the adolescent with the terrible red \"laundress's\" hands, and at how he had \"amputated himself, alive, from poetry\". He too divined the kind of casual disdain that makes for legend, imagining Rimbaud's utter indifference to his growing fame, condescending only to pass through Paris (should he ever return) to collect his royalties. </p> <p>From the repressed, brilliant, provincial Charleville boy, stunted by a mother's harshness and her terrible notions of duty, through to the scorched, weather-beaten cynic of the African years, also possessed of a twisted sense of duty and a passion for book-keeping (rather than book-making), Robb takes us on a hair-raising journey. He never lets the fugitive, shadowy figure completely escape the lens, although at times, as he says, the pursuit is difficult. A series of vivid images linger in the mind, aided by photographs and drawings: the model schoolboy, with heavily pomaded hair, all obedience without, a seething rage within; the young Bohemian with hair over his collar, smoking a clay pipe, issuing black \"industrial\" smoke; the would-be dandy of the Carjat pictures. We see the filthy peasant boy in Paris or endlessly on the road, with lice in his hair cultivated \"to flick at passing priests\"; the scourge of polite Parnassian poets; the vagabond years with Verlaine in Belgium and London; the prematurely wizened, knuckle-headed trader in east Africa; finally, the haggard, semi-delirious amputee, dying of leg cancer at the Hpital de la Conception in Marseille. </p> <p>But one burning question remains unanswered: what did the adult Rimbaud make of the growing fame of his former self, the \"veritable god of puberty\"? He certainly knew about it, from letters and requests for poems, which he filed away, but never answered. Taciturn to the end, Rimbaud never tells.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Rimbaud Graham Robb 552pp, Picador \u00a320 Buy it at BOL Speculation concerning the extraordinary life and atrocious death of Jean Nicolas Arthur Rimbaud will never reach conclusion. Mention his name and the Carjat photograph showing that oval face with the shock of dark hair, the faraway look and the wilful, almost sulky mouth springs instantly to mind. Paul Verlaine, with the gaze of a lover, found a \"kind of sweetness\" that \"glimmered and smiled in those cruel, pale-blue eyes and on those powerful red lips with their acrimonious curl\". Verlaine's wife Mathilde recalled, many years after her dreadful humiliation, that \"his eyes were blue and rather beautiful, but they had a sly expression, which in our indulgence, we took for shyness\". Carjat himself, who suffered physical injury at his hands, came to call Rimbaud \"that little toad\". This view of Rimbaud as a satanic angel has perpetuated his legend. The extreme ambiguity of both his nature and his work guarantees that his image will be stencilled on walls, along with some of his gnomic utterances, for as long as a spirit of revolt remains alive. As Graham Robb comments in the introduction to this new biography: \"Rimbaud's abandonment of poetry in his early 20s has caused more lasting, widespread consternation than the break-up of the Beatles.\" He then goes on to list the poet's multiple incarnations, his avatars, his devotees, his groupies. A poem by Malcolm Lowry consists entirely of an enumeration of Rimbaud's identities, donned and doffed with bewildering rapidity and Olympian indifference. The list runs something like this: poet, factory worker, tutor, beggar, key-ring seller, docker, circus worker, quarry foreman, mercenary, trader, gun-runner, part-time commentator on the Koran. There is evidence, though it is hotly disputed, that he was, briefly, a slave-trader. His liaison with Verlaine ensures him heroic status as one of the founders of gay culture. In more general terms, he has been recruited by every vaguely anarchist movement going, from the Commune to the Beats by way of surrealism. He has focused the energies of Bob Dylan and Jim Morrison. As to his soul, opinions have differed. Paul Claudel, Catholic int\u00e9griste, called him \"an angelic mind that was certainly illuminated by heavenly light\"; for Edmond de Goncourt he was a \"pederast assassin\". Undeterred by this welter of conflicting witness, Robb has undertaken a new biography. With two hefty \"lives\" already behind him, a Balzac and a Victor Hugo, he continues, with Rimbaud, to annex great swathes of 19th-century French literature. It is an extraordinary achievement for someone just over 40. \"Oh mad Ambition,\" wrote the 15-year-old Rimbaud in a covering letter to Th\u00e9odore de Banville when sending him his first poems, and one might apply the same phrase to Graham Robb. But cast incredulity aside: Robb has written a great biography - scholarly, humane and above all marvellously entertaining. His concise, almost clipped style is the perfect antidote to the kind of gushing, impressionistic hagiography that is the scourge of Rimbaud studies. He is a master of the understatement and the witty aside. His knowledge of the period enables him to set the scene with the minimum of fuss. And although he is quite familiar with the academic disputes and squabbles that surround the work, to his great credit he does not get drawn down into those often dreary vortices. There is throughout a sense of putting facts straight. Critics, including previous biographers such as the venerable Enid Starkie, are quietly put right - often with a deal of wit, sometimes with a hint of impatience. Unravelling the murky history of Rimbaud's financial dealings and probable wealth during his African years, to take just one example, is a huge achievement on its own. Robb sets out to question every received idea about Rimbaud; he devotes as much attention to his post-poetic life as to his early years, with the result that the one throws steady light on the other. His previous biographical and academic work has prepared him for this task. It is surely a great insight to compare Balzac and Rimbaud - in their omnivorous desire for all kinds of knowledge, in their \"philomathic\" compulsions - given the prolixity of the one and the slender gleanings of the other. Superficially, they seem to be worlds apart. Perhaps the greatest deterrent to writing the life of Rimbaud is what the subject himself would have made of the whole enterprise. Toiling away under that scornful gaze must take nerves of steel. As everyone knows, Rimbaud had stopped any literary activity by his mid-twenties, and on the very rare occasions he referred to his previous life he dismissed his productions as \"rin\u00e7ures\" - roughly translatable as \"slops\" from the kitchen sink. \"A dog never goes back to its vomit\" is the sort of phrase Rimbaud would have approved.

There was a time when the fashionable crowds trying to get into his latest exhibition would bring traffic in Piccadilly to a halt. Keats and Wordsworth addressed poems to him. He was patronised by the \"ton\" of London. He had his own school of painting - an alternative to the Royal Academy, which he despised - with Landseer and Bewick among his pupils. </p> <p>Yet the portentous history paintings that were his contribution to his age were doomed to be forgotten. If he is remembered now it is for his diary, a fascinating, thoroughly weird document in which he vaunted his achievements, elaborated his grudges and, most interestingly, recorded his meetings with great men and women of the day. </p> <p>The diary is as vivid as it is untrustworthy, shaped by the pressure of Haydon's egotism, beneath which pulses the fear of his own possible insignificance. One of the occasions it records is what Haydon was to call \"the immortal dinner\". On December 28 1817, he gathered the poets Wordsworth and Keats, the essayist Charles Lamb, Wordsworth's cousin Tom Woodhouse, the explorer Joseph Richie and the artist John Landseer (father of Edwin) for a meal in his lodgings at Lisson Grove, Paddington. They dined in Haydon's painting room, beneath his huge canvas \"Christ's Entry into Jerusalem\", which the painter believed to be his masterwork.

      "bodyText": "The Immortal Dinner Penelope Hughes-Hallett 336pp, Viking \u00a315.99 Buy it at BOL Once a man who basked in the glow of his own celebrity, the painter Benjamin Robert Haydon has long been a mere bit-player in the drama of English romanticism. There was a time when the fashionable crowds trying to get into his latest exhibition would bring traffic in Piccadilly to a halt. Keats and Wordsworth addressed poems to him. He was patronised by the \"ton\" of London. He had his own school of painting - an alternative to the Royal Academy, which he despised - with Landseer and Bewick among his pupils. Yet the portentous history paintings that were his contribution to his age were doomed to be forgotten. If he is remembered now it is for his diary, a fascinating, thoroughly weird document in which he vaunted his achievements, elaborated his grudges and, most interestingly, recorded his meetings with great men and women of the day. The diary is as vivid as it is untrustworthy, shaped by the pressure of Haydon's egotism, beneath which pulses the fear of his own possible insignificance. One of the occasions it records is what Haydon was to call \"the immortal dinner\". On December 28 1817, he gathered the poets Wordsworth and Keats, the essayist Charles Lamb, Wordsworth's cousin Tom Woodhouse, the explorer Joseph Richie and the artist John Landseer (father of Edwin) for a meal in his lodgings at Lisson Grove, Paddington. They dined in Haydon's painting room, beneath his huge canvas \"Christ's Entry into Jerusalem\", which the painter believed to be his masterwork. It showed a blank-faced Christ on a donkey blessing a crowd which included recognisable portraits of Keats, Hazlitt and Wordsworth, as well as Sir Isaac Newton, Haydon's hero, and Voltaire, his favourite intellectual villain. Haydon arranged the event to persuade himself that he was a guiding spirit of his age. At the end of the evening, rather drunk, he wrote it up in his diary. Though he recalled some of the topics of conversation (\"we had a glorious set-to - on Homer, Shakespeare, Milton and Virgil\"), the talk had, of course, evaporated. Wordsworth had been \"in fine cue\", Lamb \"exquisitely witty\" and Keats, reciting passages from Endymion, had filled the evening with a \"rich fancy of satyrs and fauns and doves and white clouds\". (This rather contradicts Haydon's earlier account of Wordsworth's crushing condescension when Keats recited his \"Hymn to Pan\" from this poem: \"a very pretty piece of Paganism,\" he said, with a curl of the lip.)

      "body": "<p>I remember watching an episode in the telly series, uncharitably called Two Fat Ladies, featuring Clarissa Dickson Wright and the adorable and much-missed Jennifer Paterson. They were out in the woods picking mushrooms. It was like Dingly Dell. Every type of mushroom - shaggy ink cap, cep, hedgehog, chanterelle and naughty old fly agaric - was poking up and screaming for attention, begging to be picked. </p> <p>It was more like the pick'n'mix at Woolworths than any experience I have had picking mushrooms. There are the great mycophiles, such as Antonio Carluccio, Pierre Koffmann and Mauro Bregoli, who cannot walk into a wood without kilo upon kilo of perfect ceps practically falling in their laps. And there is me. I have had some success, do not get me wrong. In the Chilterns, I picked nearly a kilo of trompettes de la mort (I prefer the French name to the English horn of plenty - it's more resonant and the latter is inaccurate: Horn Of Not Very Much At All Actually would be nearer the mark), and have enjoyed other minor successes. If I had to rely on my mushroom picking for nourishment, however, I would cut a much slimmer figure than I do today. </p> <p>Like chasing the fox, the hunt's the thing. Mushroom picking is as full of lore and secrecy as any masonic lodge. Good friends suddenly turn cold and evasive at the slightest enquiry as to the location of their trove. Directions as precise as \"in the south of England\" or \"an hour away from my parents' place\" begin to sound like real clues. These same people get up ridiculously early to beat each other to their quarry. This may be my problem: I've always found it hard to get much accomplished before about 11 o'clock, by which time most pickers have got back home, identified their crop, had breakfast and finished the Times crossword. </p> <p>Still, it makes a good day out, and the kids love it. Do I need to offer the usual strictures? Of course, you must not eat anything until you are absolutely sure that you know what it is, and never put anything in a common basket until you are equally sure of its identity. Common sense, really. Given my difficulties with mushrooms, I've opted for a nice, generic dish, the risotto, for our lunch. If you happen to collect a particularly good crop of ceps, make the potato and cep cake. If you are not so lucky in your hunt, fake it with dried ceps, like a disappointed angler's surreptitious visit to a fishmonger. </p> <p> All recipes serve six. </p> <p><strong> Parma ham with figs</strong></p> <p> I never know whether I prefer my Parma ham with figs or with melon - I adore both. This is the time when one has to bully at the delicatessen counter. Make sure the ham is cut from the middle and that it is cut wafer-thin. The figs must be soft and ripe - not such an easy thing to find - and have good crusty bread and unsalted butter at hand.</p> <p><strong> 400g Parma ham <br> 9-12 ripe figs, depending on size, cut into quarters</strong> </p> <p>Simply lay out the slices of ham on a big platter, surround them with quartered figs and serve. </p> <p><strong> Wild mushroom risotto</strong></p> <p><strong>750g miscellaneous wild mushrooms <br> 1 onion <br> 2 cloves garlic <br> 1 litre chicken stock <br> 100g butter <br> 450g arborio rice <br> 150g Parmesan, freshly grated</strong> </p> <p>Prepare the mushrooms by trimming the bases, scraping the stalks and cutting off any bits that are rotting. Wash the mushrooms in cold water, but do not let them soak. Slice them so that they are all roughly the same size. Peel the onion and garlic, and chop quite fine. </p> <p>Put the stock in a pot and bring gently to the boil. Put half the butter in a heavy saucepan, add the onion and garlic, and stew on a gentle heat for five minutes, then add the rice. Stir to coat it well in the butter, then add the mushrooms, all together. </p> <p>Start adding the stock, ladle by ladle, stirring the risotto as you do so. Add a little more stock every three minutes or so, after each batch has been absorbed by the rice. The mushrooms will start to render their juice, which will help to moisten and flavour the risotto. Continue until the rice is cooked but still slightly nutty to the bite. If you run out of stock before the rice is done, use hot water. Season generously, and add the rest of the butter. When the whole is completely amalgamated, serve forthwith, with the Parmesan. </p> <p><strong> Potato and cep cake</strong></p> <p> If using fresh ceps, you will need at least 250g. Slice them, season generously and stew gently in a little olive oil for 10 minutes. They will absorb any liquid, and can be put straight into the cake once cooled.</p> <p><strong> 125g dried ceps<br> 150g unsalted butter <br> 2 cloves of garlic <br> 25ml olive oil <br> 750g large potatoes <br> 75g Gruy\u00e8re, grated</strong> </p> <p>Soak the ceps in cold water for four hours, then drain. Take a straight-sided, round, ovenproof dish 20cm in diameter and at least 6cm deep, and grease with half the butter, taking special care that the base is well covered. Peel the garlic and chop it very finely. Warm the olive oil in a frying pan, gently stew the garlic in it for a minute and then add the drained ceps. Let these stew and soften over a low heat, turning them occasionally, for about 20 minutes, until tender. Season and leave to cool. </p> <p>Peel the potatoes and cut them into rounds the thickness of a 2p piece. Do not wash these slices, as the starch on them will help keep them together. Overlap slices of potato in the base of the dish in a nice pattern. Season the potatoes, dot with some of the remaining butter and distribute a few ceps on top, then sprinkle with a little cheese. Continue to layer the potatoes, buttering and seasoning them a little each time, with the mushrooms and cheese, finishing with a layer of potatoes. Cover with a butter paper or some buttered foil, and put on the bottom shelf of an oven preheated to 245C/475F/gas mark 9 for 45 minutes. Test the potatoes with a knife, and when they are cooked through, run the knife around the inside of the dish. Let the cake settle for five minutes before inverting it on to a plate. The potatoes should be a crisp, golden-brown on the outside and creamy within. Serve with a green salad of frizzy endive and a sharp dressing. </p> <p><strong> Poached pears with Beaujolais</strong></p> <p> <strong> 6 large pears, approaching full ripeness <br> 1 lemon, juiced <br> 1 bottle Beaujolais <br> 200g caster sugar, or more to taste <br> 1 cinnamon stick <br> 4 cloves <br> 12 black peppercorns <br> 3 strips lemon zest <br> 3 strips orange zest <br> 2 tbsp redcurrant jelly</strong> </p> <p>Carefully peel the pears, leaving the stalks on, and roll them in the lemon juice. Combine the wine, sugar, spices and strips of zest in a saucepan and bring to the boil. Simmer gently for 15 minutes. Add the pears and poach very gently for 15 minutes, or longer, if they are less ripe. Lift the pears out of the liquor into a serving bowl. Strain the liquor, put it back in the pan and boil until reduced by a third. Whisk in the redcurrant jelly and pour it over the pears. Leave to cool. Serve cold with cream or ice cream - either vanilla, or this delicious cinnamon version. </p> <p><strong> Cinnamon ice cream</strong></p> <p> There's no substitute for an ice-cream machine here, I'm afraid.</p> <p><strong> 2 cinnamon sticks <br> 750ml milk <br> 10 egg yolks <br> 200g caster sugar <br> 250ml double cream</strong> </p> <p>Break the cinnamon sticks in half and place them in a saucepan along with the milk. Bring to the boil, then remove from the heat and leave to infuse for 20 minutes. Beat the egg yolks and sugar together. Bring the infused milk back to the boil, and pour about a third of it in a slow trickle over the egg yolks and sugar, whisking constantly. </p> <p>Pour this mixture back into the pan, whisking well. Place on a gentle heat and stir with a wooden spoon until it starts to thicken. Remove from the heat immediately, strain into a bowl and leave to cool. Whip the cream until it thickens and leaves a trail off the end of the whisk. Pour in the cold cinnamon custard and whisk until it is completely mixed.

She is Jewish, and during the intifada she wrote an article in the student newspaper called Victim To Victimiser, in which she said \"that not only does Israel have to end the occupation for the Palestinians, but also it has to end the occupation for its own people, especially its women\". As a result of this one 800-word article, Klein received bomb threats at her home and at the newspaper office - \"and to this day I have never been more scared for my life\". </p> <p>\"After the article came out, the Jewish students' union, who were staunch Zionists, called a meeting to discuss what they were going to do about my article - and I went along, because nobody knew what I looked like. And the woman sitting next to me said, 'If I ever meet Naomi Klein, I'm going to kill her.' So I just stood up and said, 'I'm Naomi Klein, I wrote Victim To Victimiser, and I'm as much a Jew as every single one of you.' I've never felt anything like the silence in that room after that. I was 19, and it made me tough.\" </p> <p>Klein became an outspoken feminist activist at college, campaigning on issues of media repre- sentation and gender visibility that constituted feminism at the end of the 80s - she received rape threats as a result - and, rather than finish her degree, she dropped out to work as an intern on the Toronto Globe And Mail. She left to become editor of an alternative political magazine, This Magazine. \"When I was there [in the early 90s], I did not feel that we were part of a political movement in any way - in that there was not a left. We had to kind of invent it as we went along. The stress of it was the stress of the left. It burned us out.\" The left that did exist Klein found depressing. \"The only thing leftwing voices were saying was stop the cuts, stop the world we want to get off. It was very negative and regressive, it wasn't imaginative, it didn't have its own sense of itself in any way.\" </p> <p>It was around this time that advertising and branding started to co-opt alternative politics and culture. \"On the one hand, there was this total paralysis of the left. But, at the exact same time, all these ideas that I had thought were the left - feminism and diversity and gay and lesbian rights - were suddenly very chic. So, on the one hand, you're politically totally disempowered, and on the other all the imagery is pseudo-feminist, Benetton is an anti-racism organisation, Starbucks does this third-world-chic thing. I watched my own politics become commercialised.\" This imagery was, she says, a \"mask for capitalism. It was making it more difficult to see the power dynamics in society. Because this was a time when there was a growing income gap between rich and poor that was quite staggering all over the world - and yet everything looked way more equitable, in terms of the imagery of the culture.\" </p> <p>Klein went back to university in 1995 to try to finish her degree, and something very clearly had changed. \"I met this new generation of young radicals who had grown up taking for granted the idea that corporations are more powerful than governments, that it doesn't matter who you elect because they'll all act the same. And they were, like, fine, we'll go where the power is. We'll adapt. It didn't fill them with dread and depression. When I was at university before, we thought our only power was to ban something - but they were very hands-on, DIY, if you don't like something change it, cut it, paste it, download it. Even though I don't think culture jamming by itself is a powerful political tool, there's something about that posture that's impressive - it's unintimidated hand-to-brand contact. The young activists I know have grounded their political activism in economic analysis and an understanding of how power works. They're way more sophisticated than we were because they've had to be. Because capitalism is way more sophisticated now. </p> <p>\"I think I'm lucky because I got to witness a significant shift, something that changed, and I wanted to document that shift. And it seemed very, very clear to me that if there was going to be a future for the left it would have to be an anti-corporate movement.\" </p> <p>And so, Seattle in November last year - where 50,000 demonstrators actually prevented a major WTO meeting from happening - did she expect it to be so big? \"Oh no. Seattle surprised me with its militancy. It surprised the organisers. It surprised everyone. I mean, this was the States . There were all these underground networks of activism, and it just came to life. Right now, the movement is at the stage of grassroots ferment - and it'll either degenerate into chaos or it'll come together organically into something new.\" </p> <p>The first thing people tend to ask Klein is where she shops. Does she buy Nike trainers? Does she never nip into Starbucks for a grande cappuccino? Is her wardrobe certifiably sweatshop-free? \"I'm the worst person to ask these questions,\" she says, \"because since the book came out people really are watching what I buy. If I walked around Toronto with a Starbucks, it would be seen that I was endorsing that brand.\" But, she says, for anyone who hasn't written a book about corporations and sweatshops, it's a different matter. \"I firmly believe that it's not about where you shop. I'm lucky in that I happen to live a few blocks from some great independent designers, so I actually can shop in stores where I know where stuff is produced. But I can't say that to a 17-year-old girl in the suburbs who can only shop at the mall. It's not a fair message. </p> <p>\"This is not a consumer issue; it's a political issue. There is a way for us to respond as citizens that is not simply as consumers. Over and over again, people's immediate response to these issues is: what do I buy? I have to immediately solve this problem through shopping. But you can like the products and not like the corporate behaviour; because the corporate behaviour is a political issue, and the products are just stuff. The movement is really not about being purer-than-thou and producing a recipe for being an ethical consumer. That drains a lot of political energy.\" </p> <p>Is this why she published in Britain with Flamingo, part of the Murdoch-owned HarperCollins, a major corporation if ever there was one? \"To be honest, I really did not have my pick of publishers in Britain. Only one wanted the book. What I said when I signed with HarperCollins was that I was going to go out of my way to write about Murdoch, more than I would have done otherwise. I did, and they didn't touch it.\" </p> <p>As a populariser of the movement's arguments, does Klein consider herself an activist or a journalist? \"I see myself as an activist journalist,\" she says. \"I became a journalist because I'm not comfortable being an activist. I hate crowds - I know, great irony - and I'm physically incapable of chanting. I'm always slightly detached, so I write about it to feel more comfortable. I like to believe that I can be part of this movement without being a propagandist. There's a really strong tradition of this, like Gloria Steinem, Norman Mailer, Susan Faludi. I do think that there's so much fragmentation in this movement that if someone tries to work out a coherent thesis - even if you don't agree with all or even much of it - it can be helpful by making something more solid.\" </p> <p>In Prague, at the protests against the IMF/World Bank, she will be speaking at today's counter-summit, but she is concerned that the media has already portrayed the protesters as mad terrorists crossing continents with the sole intention of kicking some Czech police. \"Months ago we were already seeing the most extreme attempts to criminalise protest. This is a protest about the IMF and the World Bank, and the effects they're having on poorer countries. We must not let the reaction of the state and the police entirely define the message. I'm going to Prague because I believe it is a crucially important opportunity to show the world what this movement really is - the first genuinely international people's movement.\" </p> <p>There are some who wonder, though, whether the IMF and corporations are the right target. Isn't it governments that we should be aiming at, since it is governments, initially led by Reagan and Thatcher with their dramatic lowering of corporate taxes, which gave the corporations such power in the first place? \"I think these corporations are not really targets, they are metaphors,\" says Klein. \"They're being used by this generation of young activists as a popular education tool to understand the global economy. When I was at university, we were intimidated and didn't understand anything about globalisation. So we tuned out from that and turned in on ourselves and became more and more insular - which is the great irony of those years, because that was when all this accelerated globalisation was happening. We weren't watching. And what I see happening with, say, the campaign against Nike is a tactic on the part of activists who've decided to turn these companies into metaphors for the global economy gone awry.\" </p> <p>In other words, when the global economy is so huge, so forbidding, the corporations are an accessible way in. \"When the WTO was created in Uruguay in 1995, there were no protesters outside. These trade bureaucrats created a world of incredibly complex institutions and arcane trade agreements written by policy wonks with no interest in popularising. So I believe that anti-corporate campaigns are the bridge: they're the first baby-step to developing an analysis of global capitalism.\" </p> <p>Indeed, an important and fascinating aspect of the movement has been popular education - groups holding mass teach-ins on global politics, international economics, the IMF, the World Bank, the WTO (the \"iron triangle of corporate rule\"); Naafta, the EU, Gatt, Apec, G-8, the OECD, structural adjustment. At Seattle, activists in their 20s sat for eight hours at a stretch listening to speakers from around the world decode globalisation for them. </p> <p>Is this a re-invention of left politics? After a decade in the wilderness, is anti-corporatism the post-cold war new New Left? \"I think it is,\" says Klein, \"but it's only at the early stages of re-invention. Sometimes, I think it's moving towards creating a global new deal, and sometimes I think it's way more radical than that. And it might be - I don't know.\" I mention the impact of the very word \"capitalism\", which had gone resolutely out of fashion until June 18, 1999, when demonstrators staged an \"anti-capitalist\" demonstration in the City of London. \"Since June 18, the comeback of the word 'capitalism' is just extraordinary,\" laughs Klein. \"It's like Santana - what the hell's going on? Suddenly they're talking about 'capitalism' on CNN, and in Washington there are all these little girls wearing caps with 'Capitalism Sux' on them. For a long time, the very word has been invisible - it's just the economy, the way the world works.\" And that change has happened in little over a year. \"That's why I feel optimistic, and I'm not impatient about the pace of change.\" </p> <p>The trouble is, we're used to thinking that something that is anti-capitalist must be straightforwardly socialist or communist, which is not the case with this movement. It is, instead, \"an amalgam of environmentalism, anti-capitalism, anarchy and the kitchen sink\", says Klein - which leads us to the central criticism levelled at all the anti-corporate protests. What do they stand for? What are their goals? Where is their vision? </p> <p> \"I think I have more patience for finding this out than most people,\" says Klein. \"I've been following this movement for five years, and I know where we were at five years ago and I know where we are now. We were nowhere. That a genuine political movement can begin to emerge in that timespan, organically, on its own - it's extraordinary. I think a lot of those demanding a manifesto or a leader are people of a different generation who have an idea in their mind of what a political movement looks like, and they want Abbie Hoffman or Gloria Steinem and where are they?\"</p> <p>Even such diverse campaigns - from groups fighting against Nike, or agribusiness, or world debt, or the Free Trade Area of the Americas - \"share a belief that the disparate problems with which they are wrestling all derive from global deregulation, an agenda that is concentrating power and wealth into fewer and fewer hands\". And the fragmentation of the campaigns, says Klein, is a \"reasonable, even ingenious adaptation of changes in the broader culture\". The movement, with its hubs and spokes and hotlinks, its emphasis on information rather than ideology, reflects the tool it uses - it is the \"internet come to life\". This is why it doesn't work well on television, unlike the anti-Vietnam protests of the 60s with their leaders, their slogans, their single-issue politics.</p> <p>When people say that the movement lacks vision, believes Klein, what they really mean is that it is different from anything that's gone before, that it is a completely new kind of movement - just as the internet is a completely new kind of medium. \"What critics are really saying is that the movement lacks an overarching revolutionary philosophy, such as Marxism, democratic socialism, deep ecology or social anarchy, on which they all agree.\" But the movement should not, says Klein, be in a hurry to define itself. \"Before they sign on to anyone's 10-point plan, they deserve the chance to see if, out of the movement's chaotic, decentralised, multi-headed webs, something new, something entirely its own, can emerge.\"</p> <p>No Logo has been leapt upon by some commentators who are thrilled by Naomi Klein's rejection of the identity politics of her youth, and so see it as anti-feminist. \"This is not a rejection of feminism,\" she says. \"It is a return to the roots of feminism - early feminism was very involved in anti-sweatshop action, and the current anti-sweatshop movement very much sees it as a feminist issue, since it is overwhelmingly women of colour who are being abused by the systems. I feel that we lost our way in the late 80s, when feminism became disengaged from its roots, which originally had critiques of capitalism and of consumerism. I am a feminist and this is a feminist book.\"</p> <p>This, I believe, is crucial to understanding both why the movement is so popular with young people and why Klein is so perfectly placed to be its chief populariser. In the 60s and 70s, activists concentrated their anti-racism and feminism on matters of equality - equal rights and equal pay. In Klein's 80s and 90s, they campaigned instead on issues of culture and identity: portrayal in the media, who gets to the board. But the new generation of activists is taking the best bits of both: developing a radical critique of the global economy, while incorporating identity politics as a matter of course. So, whereas Sheila Rowbotham was greeted with a barrage of wolf-whistles and guffaws when she got on stage to speak about education at a leftist conference in 1968, no one is surprised that this movement's main theorist is a woman. This is a far more inclusive movement than those that have gone before.</p> <p>There's a personal recollection in No Logo in which Klein talks about being 17 and wondering what to do with her life. She was frustrated, because if you wanted to be a traveller Lonely Planet had got there first; if you wanted to be an avant-garde artist, someone had done it all already, and put the image on a mug for you to take home. \"All my parents wanted was the open road and a VW camper,\" she writes. \"That was enough escape for them.\" Now it feels as if there is \"no open space anywhere\". It is as if this generation's culture is being sold out as they are living it; there is nothing left to discover.</p> <p>Her thesis is about trying to find some space that hasn't been bought up by anyone; trying to rediscover our identities as citizens, and not just consumers. It is about globalisation, and the power corporations have over our lives. But it is also about being 30, having spent your youth in a disaffected age. Her grandfather, the animator blacklisted by McCarthy, would be proud: Naomi Klein might just be helping re-invent politics for a new generation.</p> <p>\u0095 No Logo, by Naomi Klein, is published by HarperCollins, priced \u00a314.99.

      "bodyText": "When she went to university a year later, a major news event ensured that her politicisation was inevitable. \"The pivotal moment politically for me was in December 1989, when there was a massacre at the University of Montreal. A man went into the engineering school - he had failed to get a place - and he separated the men from the women, shouted, 'You're all a bunch of fucking feminists', and opened fire. He killed 14 women. There was nothing like that incident in Canadian history - this is not America, where serial murders happen all the time - and it was a hate crime against women. It was a cataclysmic moment. It politicised us enormously. Of course, after that you call yourself a feminist.\" It was also at university that Klein learned what it's like to be attacked for her opinions. She is Jewish, and during the intifada she wrote an article in the student newspaper called Victim To Victimiser, in which she said \"that not only does Israel have to end the occupation for the Palestinians, but also it has to end the occupation for its own people, especially its women\". As a result of this one 800-word article, Klein received bomb threats at her home and at the newspaper office - \"and to this day I have never been more scared for my life\". \"After the article came out, the Jewish students' union, who were staunch Zionists, called a meeting to discuss what they were going to do about my article - and I went along, because nobody knew what I looked like. And the woman sitting next to me said, 'If I ever meet Naomi Klein, I'm going to kill her.' So I just stood up and said, 'I'm Naomi Klein, I wrote Victim To Victimiser, and I'm as much a Jew as every single one of you.' I've never felt anything like the silence in that room after that. I was 19, and it made me tough.\" Klein became an outspoken feminist activist at college, campaigning on issues of media repre- sentation and gender visibility that constituted feminism at the end of the 80s - she received rape threats as a result - and, rather than finish her degree, she dropped out to work as an intern on the Toronto Globe And Mail. She left to become editor of an alternative political magazine, This Magazine. \"When I was there [in the early 90s], I did not feel that we were part of a political movement in any way - in that there was not a left. We had to kind of invent it as we went along. The stress of it was the stress of the left. It burned us out.\" The left that did exist Klein found depressing. \"The only thing leftwing voices were saying was stop the cuts, stop the world we want to get off. It was very negative and regressive, it wasn't imaginative, it didn't have its own sense of itself in any way.\" It was around this time that advertising and branding started to co-opt alternative politics and culture. \"On the one hand, there was this total paralysis of the left. But, at the exact same time, all these ideas that I had thought were the left - feminism and diversity and gay and lesbian rights - were suddenly very chic. So, on the one hand, you're politically totally disempowered, and on the other all the imagery is pseudo-feminist, Benetton is an anti-racism organisation, Starbucks does this third-world-chic thing. I watched my own politics become commercialised.\" This imagery was, she says, a \"mask for capitalism. It was making it more difficult to see the power dynamics in society.

      "body": "<p>From the age of six, growing up in Canada, Naomi Klein was obsessed with brand names, and what she could buy. She had a thing about the bright signs she saw from the back-seat window of the family car: McDonald's, Texaco, Burger King and, especially, the fluorescent yellow gorgeousness of Shell: \"So bright and cartoon-like I was convinced that, if I could climb up and touch it, it would be like touching something from another dimension - from the world of TV.\" She used to stitch little fake alligators on to her T-shirts so they would look like Lacoste, had a Saturday job in Esprit (they had the best logo), and her biggest fights with her parents were over Barbie and the price of designer jeans. In her high-school yearbook - where some are labelled \"most likely to succeed\" - she was \"most likely to be in jail for stealing peroxide\". She was defined by the products she used to change the colour of her hair. </p> <p>But now, aged 30, Klein has written a book, No Logo, which has been called \"the Das Kapital of the growing anti-corporate movement\". The teenager fixated on brand names has become a campaigner against our over-branded world, and a populariser of the kind of anti-corporate ideas that are currently fuelling protesters against the IMF/World Bank meeting in Prague. The book has been a word-of-mouth sensation, giving voice to a generation of people under 30 who have never related to politics until now. The band Radiohead were so inspired by No Logo that they have banned corporate advertising from their British tour, deeming all venues \"logo-free\" - Ed O'Brien, the guitarist, says, \"No Logo certainly made me feel less alone. She was writing everything I was trying to make sense of in my head. It was very uplifting.\" </p> <p>As a chronicler of what she calls \"the next big political movement - and the first genuinely international people's movement\" - Klein writes that Nike paid Michael Jordan more in 1992 for endorsing its trainers ($20 million) than the company paid its entire 30,000-strong Indonesian workforce for making them; why, in her opinion, this makes people angry; and why that anger is expressed in rallies outside the Nike Town superstore, rather than outside government buildings or embassies. She shows how globalisation has hit the poor the most, and how this new political movement is both historically informed and absolutely of the moment, like nothing that has gone before. </p> <p>And, as we shall see, it was bound to be some- one such as Naomi Klein who would be both at the heart of anti-corporatism and interpret it for everyone else. The anti-corporate movement is resolutely disparate, and has no leaders; but it is no coincidence that its most prominent populariser should be a 30-year-old woman from North America (the heart of wealth and power), whose political background is a leftwing family and a teenage rebellion through shopping. As we shall see, she is perfectly placed to reflect these times. </p> <p>Klein's argument starts with what we all recognise. Logos, she says, are \"the closest thing we have to an international language, by force of ubiquity\". Most of the world's six billion people could identify the McDonald's sign, or the Coca-Cola symbol - we are united by what we are being sold. And the selling, these days, isn't just in magazines or on billboards: Gordon's gin fills British cinemas with the smell of juniper berries; in some Scandinavian countries, you can get \"free\" long-distance calls if you consent to ads cutting into your telephone conversations; Nasa has solicited ads to run on its space stations. There's no escape. </p> <p>Furthermore, advertising today is not merely about selling products; it is about selling a brand, a dream, a message. So Nike's aim is not to sell trainers but to \"enhance people's lives through sports and fitness\". IBM doesn't sell computers, it sells \"solutions\". And as for Polaroid, well, it's not a camera - it's a \"social lubricant\". You sell the message of your brand, not your product, and you can expand as widely as you like. As Richard Branson says, you \"build brands not around products but around reputation\" - and leap from record shops to cola to banking to trains. </p> <p>But Branson's trains show how fragile this strategy might be - if Virgin trains don't run on time, why should you trust his bank? Or look what happened to Nike - from being \"the spirit of sports\" in the early 90s, the campaign against its use of atrocious sweatshops in developing countries led CEO Phil Knight to confess in 1998 that his shoes \"have become synonymous with slave wages, forced overtime and arbitrary abuse\". When it's no longer just about trainers, when the corporations have promised so much more - a way of life! - they have very much more to lose. </p> <p>What's more, says Klein, people start to resent the colonisation of their lives. Fine, they say, I'll buy my shoes from you, but I don't want you to take over my head. Young activists, says Klein, feel that their cultural and political space has been taken away and sold back to them, neatly-packaged, as \"alternative\" or \"anti-sexist\" or \"anti-racist\". So Seattle grunge (including its star, Kurt Cobain) implodes through commercialisation, and the designer Christian Lacroix says, \"It's terrible to say, very often the most exciting outfits are from the poorest people.\" So the Body Shop displays posters condemning domestic violence and Nike runs an ad saying, \"I believe high heels are a conspiracy against women.\" So Nike signs up black stars such as Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods, and then adorns the walls of Nike Town with quotes from Woods saying, \"There are still courses in the US where I am not allowed to play, because of the colour of my skin.\" It's anti-racism without the politics; 50 years of civil-rights history reduced to an anodyne advertising slogan. </p> <p>Next, the big brands effectively force out small businesses and take over as much physical space as possible, with mergers and synergy being the business buzzwords. Starbucks coffee shops (once they have co-opted a right-on, third-world-loving, world-music-playing milieu) operate by \"clustering\": an area becomes saturated with branches, local cafes close down (preferably well-liked independent ones in groovy areas) and the big brands take over. Meanwhile, McDonald's wages a 26-year battle against a man called Ronald McDonald whose McDonald's Family Restaurant in a small town in Illinois was founded in 1956. How dare he be born with the same name as a corporate giant? </p> <p>And while the corporations are busy doing what they think is important - branding a way of life, putting the squeeze on independent shopkeepers, and the like - someone, somewhere, has to make the stuff. This may be a time of \"degraded production in the age of the superbrand\", as Klein puts it, but corporations do tend to need a product somewhere along the line. The \"death of manufacturing\" is only a western phenomenon - as we're consuming more products than ever, someone must be making them. But it's difficult to find out who. As Klein says, \"the shift in attitude toward production is so profound that, where a previous era of consumer goods corporations displayed their logos on the facades of their factories, many of today's brand-based multinationals maintain that the location of their production operations is a 'trade secret', to be guarded at all costs.\" Very often, it seems, they are produced under terrible conditions in free-trade zones in Indonesia, China, Mexico, Vietnam, the Philippines and elsewhere. </p> <p>The sweatshops Klein visited in Cavite, the largest free-trade zone in the Philippines, have rules against talking and smiling. There is forced overtime, but no job security - it's \"no work, no pay\" when the orders don't come in. Toilets are padlocked except during two 15-minute breaks per day - seamstresses sewing clothes for western high-street chains told Klein that they have to urinate in plastic bags under their machines. Women like Carmelita Alonzo, who sewed clothes for the Gap and Liz Claiborne, had a two-hour commute home, and died after being denied time off for pneumonia, a common illness in these factories. As Klein says, people are now demanding to know why, if the big brands have so much power and influence over price and marketing, they do not also have the power to demand and enforce ethical labour standards from such suppliers. </p> <p>And don't think, says Klein, that the developing world is the only place for exploitation by western industry. \"Cavite may be capitalism's dream vacation, but casualisation is a game that can be played at home,\" she writes. Europe and North America have played host to the most extraordinary rise in impermanence at work over the past two decades. The \"McJob\" is a contemporary template: low-paid, no benefits, no union recognition and no guarantee that your job will be there in the morning. At Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer which opened its first British shop in July after buying Asda, \"full time\" in its US branches means just 28 hours a week; the average annual wage is a barely-livable $10,920. \"You can buy two grande mocha cappuccinos with my hourly salary,\" says Laurie Bonang, a worker in Starbucks. Microsoft, the gleaming testament to the hi-tech products of our future, has an extraordinary one-third of its workforce working as temps. As Klein says, \"It was Microsoft, with its famous employee stock-option plan, that developed and fostered the mythology of Silicon Gold; but it is also Microsoft that has done the most to dismantle it.\" </p> <p>So what happens when working conditions and modes of production fail to match up to a glorious, positive, right-on brand identity? People start to get angry. </p> <p>Anticorporate activism is on the rise precisely because branding has worked so well, believes Klein, in a neat example of the Marxist idea that capitalism contains within itself the seeds of its own destruction. \"Multinationals such as Nike, Microsoft and Starbucks have sought to become the chief communicators of all that is good and cherished in our culture: art, sport, community, connection, equality. But the more successful this project is, the more vulnerable these companies become. When they do wrong, their crimes are not dismissed as the misdemeanours of another corporation trying to make a buck. This is a connection more akin to the relationship of fan and celebrity: emotionally intense, but shallow enough to turn on a dime.\" Having lived that relationship with consumer goods herself, Klein knows just how it feels. </p> <p>She says that anti-brand activism is taking place on two fronts. \"On the one hand, it's throwing bricks through McDonald's window in Seattle. On the other, it's saying that we actually want the real thing, the real 'third place' [not home, not work] that Starbucks tries to sell to us, the real public space. People are saying: 'I do want real community, this is a strong and powerful idea, and I resent the fact that this idea has been stolen from me.' You've got these products that are held up on insane pedestals - all of the collective longings of our culture have been projected on to lattes or trainers. So there's a process of actively denting the facade of the brand with the reality of the production.\" </p> <p>This deconstruction takes many forms, some more successful than others. The activism includes \"culture jamming\", whereby ads are subverted by \"guerrilla artists\" to send anti-corporate messages out to the public; jammers paint hollow skulls on the faces of Gap models, or change an Apple ad featuring the Dalai Lama and the slogan \"Think Different\" to \"Think Disillusioned\". It includes the campaign group Reclaim The Streets, which started in Britain partly in response to the 1994 Criminal Justice Act and which focuses its concerns on environmentalism and the removal of public space; they stop cars, block a road and have a party on it. Reclaim The Streets is now an international movement - on May 16, 1998, 30 Global Street Parties took place around the world. </p> <p>Students in North America, meanwhile, have been active in anti-sweatshop campaigns, most noticeably since 1995-96, which Andrew Ross, author of anti-sweatshop textbook No Sweat, calls \"the year of the sweatshop\". It was a year that brought many revelations. One typical example: a factory manager making clothes in El Salvador for a major US clothing firm announced that \"blood will flow\" if anyone joined a union. And another, more shocking for the American public: the named-brand clothes line of TV presenter Kathie Lee Gifford (a bit like Lorraine Kelly, only cheesier) was manufactured by child labourers in Honduras and in illegal sweatshops in New York. (She cried on TV and became an anti-sweatshop campaigner herself.) Guess, Mattel, Disney and Nike were the targets of similar expos\u00e9s. </p> <p>The tactics of many of these anti-sweatshop groups involve \"head-on collisions between image and reality\", says Klein, whether it is filming an Indonesian Nike worker gasping as she learns that the trainers she made for $2 a day sell for $120 a pair in San Francisco Nike Town, or comparing the hourly salary of Michael Eisner, CEO of Disney ($9,783), with that of a Haitian worker who stitches Disney merchandise (28 cents). </p> <p>Other brand tactics simply hit companies where it hurts most. Nike didn't seem too bothered about the campaign against it that took off so vehemently in the US in the mid-90s, until a group of black 13-year-olds from the Bronx, the company's target market and the one exploited by it to get a street-cool image, learned that the trainers they bought for $180 cost $5 to make, which led to a mass dumping of their old Nike trainers outside New York's Nike Town. (One boy, reports Klein, looked straight into the TV news camera and, showing a brand understanding that should alert his elders, said, \"Nike, we made you. We can break you.\") </p> <p>The UK's McLibel trial, which began in 1990, hurt McDonald's so seriously - even though the firm eventually won the case - because it forced the hamburger giant to be open about its business practices. After suing two British environmentalists for libel, the firm was forced to spend a humiliating 313 days in court, the longest trial in British history, defending every last detail of its business and making a number of spectacu- lar gaffes along the way, such as one executive's claim that Coca-Cola is nutritious because it is \"providing water, and I think that is part of a balanced diet\"; and another's that McDonald's burial of rubbish in landfill sites is \"a benefit, otherwise you will end up with lots of vast empty gravel pits all over the country\". </p> <p>Some activists use the courtroom; others, such as those opposed to Shell's involvement with the Nigerian military government that devastated the Ogoni lands and executed their champion, the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa in 1994, focus on issues of freedom of expression. Others humiliate corporations on TV, take over roads, jam ads, gather wherever there is an international summit (Auckland, Vancouver, Manila, Birmingham, London, Geneva, Kuala Lumpur, Cologne, Washington DC, Seattle, Prague), wreck a McDonald's before it has even been built (the Peasant Confederation in Millau, France). And in the developing world, home to the main victims of the global economy, rural activists burn GM seeds and hold laughing protests (Karnataka state farmers in India, who claim to number 10 million), revolt against the privatisation of the water system (Bolivia), strike and take over the national university over a World Bank edict to raise student fees (Mexican students). The protest in Seattle was so huge because it was diverse; the US union movement marched side by side with the head of the Filipino peasant movement. It is global, anarchic and chaotic, like the internet it uses to organise; it is, says Klein, \"the internet come to life\". </p> <p>When we meet, Klein serves a fruity drink that, its maker's claim, is packed with intelligence-boosting herbs. (I don't remember the brand name.) She is shy at first, and then not shy at all. She doesn't wear Gap or drink Starbucks, and is a lively and witty speaker (in public, too); her conversation is full of pop culture vernacular and jokes against herself. We sit in her backyard in Toronto, which has a flourishing 'No Logo' clematis (named to celebrate finishing her book), and are interrupted a couple of times: first by her husband, Avi Lewis, a big TV star in Canada for his hugely successful, four-times-a-week political discussion programme; then by his mother, Michele Landsberg, one of Canada's foremost radical feminists, bearing gossip and a salmon. Klein and Lewis married because they wanted to \"have a big party\", but they don't wear rings because they don't want to be branded as married. Entertaining, political, down-to-earth, they clearly have a great time together; Lewis says that, since he met Klein, he's \"got a lot more serious and had a lot more fun\". </p> <p>Klein grew up with politics all around her. Her grandparents were American Marxists in the 30s and 40s; her grandfather was an animator at Disney who was fired and blacklisted for organising the company's first strike. Her parents, who are also American, moved to Canada in protest at the Vietnam war. Her father is a doctor and her mother, Bonnie Klein, made the seminal anti-pornography film, This Is Not A Love Story, in 1980. \"My mother was really involved in the anti-pornography movement, and when I was at school I found it very oppressive to have a very public feminist mother - it was a source of endless embarrassment. When This Is Not A Love Story came out, there was a lot of backlash against my mother. The headline in the Toronto Globe And Mail was \"Bourgeois Feminist Fascist\", and she was made Hustler magazine's asshole of the month; they took my mother's head and put it on the back of a donkey. It was not cool in 1980 to be making films about pornography. Not at my elementary school, anyway.\" </p> <p>This, she says, is part of the reason she wanted nothing to do with politics when she was growing up. \"I think it's why I embraced full-on consumerism. I was in constant conflict with my parents and I wanted them to leave me the hell alone.\" Her brother, who is two years older, did not go through the same kind of rebellion: \"I don't think he was quite so much a victim of the 80s as I was. We had no culture growing up. We had Cyndi Lauper.\" </p> <p>So, after years of obsession with Barbie, Girl's World and Disneyland, what brought about the change? \"I know the only way that I escaped the mall - which is not to say that I don't ever go, or enjoy it - the only way I got consumerism and vanity into a sane place in my life, though I don't think we are ever rid of them, was just by becoming interested in other things. It's that simple. Saying that you're a bad person for buying this or wanting this only turns people off.\" Klein was all set to go to the University of Toronto to study English and philosophy when her mother had a very severe stroke aged 46. She took a year off to care for her. \"I think that's what stopped me from being such a brat.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/weekend/story/0,3605,371824,00.html\">Read part two of Hand-to-brand-combat here</a></p> <p>\u0095 No Logo, by Naomi Klein, is published by HarperCollins, priced \u00a314.99.

And another, more shocking for the American public: the named-brand clothes line of TV presenter Kathie Lee Gifford (a bit like Lorraine Kelly, only cheesier) was manufactured by child labourers in Honduras and in illegal sweatshops in New York. (She cried on TV and became an anti-sweatshop campaigner herself.) Guess, Mattel, Disney and Nike were the targets of similar expos\u00e9s. The tactics of many of these anti-sweatshop groups involve \"head-on collisions between image and reality\", says Klein, whether it is filming an Indonesian Nike worker gasping as she learns that the trainers she made for $2 a day sell for $120 a pair in San Francisco Nike Town, or comparing the hourly salary of Michael Eisner, CEO of Disney ($9,783), with that of a Haitian worker who stitches Disney merchandise (28 cents). Other brand tactics simply hit companies where it hurts most. Nike didn't seem too bothered about the campaign against it that took off so vehemently in the US in the mid-90s, until a group of black 13-year-olds from the Bronx, the company's target market and the one exploited by it to get a street-cool image, learned that the trainers they bought for $180 cost $5 to make, which led to a mass dumping of their old Nike trainers outside New York's Nike Town. (One boy, reports Klein, looked straight into the TV news camera and, showing a brand understanding that should alert his elders, said, \"Nike, we made you. We can break you.\") The UK's McLibel trial, which began in 1990, hurt McDonald's so seriously - even though the firm eventually won the case - because it forced the hamburger giant to be open about its business practices. After suing two British environmentalists for libel, the firm was forced to spend a humiliating 313 days in court, the longest trial in British history, defending every last detail of its business and making a number of spectacu- lar gaffes along the way, such as one executive's claim that Coca-Cola is nutritious because it is \"providing water, and I think that is part of a balanced diet\"; and another's that McDonald's burial of rubbish in landfill sites is \"a benefit, otherwise you will end up with lots of vast empty gravel pits all over the country\". Some activists use the courtroom; others, such as those opposed to Shell's involvement with the Nigerian military government that devastated the Ogoni lands and executed their champion, the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa in 1994, focus on issues of freedom of expression. Others humiliate corporations on TV, take over roads, jam ads, gather wherever there is an international summit (Auckland, Vancouver, Manila, Birmingham, London, Geneva, Kuala Lumpur, Cologne, Washington DC, Seattle, Prague), wreck a McDonald's before it has even been built (the Peasant Confederation in Millau, France). And in the developing world, home to the main victims of the global economy, rural activists burn GM seeds and hold laughing protests (Karnataka state farmers in India, who claim to number 10 million), revolt against the privatisation of the water system (Bolivia), strike and take over the national university over a World Bank edict to raise student fees (Mexican students). The protest in Seattle was so huge because it was diverse; the US union movement marched side by side with the head of the Filipino peasant movement. It is global, anarchic and chaotic, like the internet it uses to organise; it is, says Klein, \"the internet come to life\". When we meet, Klein serves a fruity drink that, its maker's claim, is packed with intelligence-boosting herbs. (I don't remember the brand name.) She is shy at first, and then not shy at all. She doesn't wear Gap or drink Starbucks, and is a lively and witty speaker (in public, too); her conversation is full of pop culture vernacular and jokes against herself. We sit in her backyard in Toronto, which has a flourishing 'No Logo' clematis (named to celebrate finishing her book), and are interrupted a couple of times: first by her husband, Avi Lewis, a big TV star in Canada for his hugely successful, four-times-a-week political discussion programme; then by his mother, Michele Landsberg, one of Canada's foremost radical feminists, bearing gossip and a salmon. Klein and Lewis married because they wanted to \"have a big party\", but they don't wear rings because they don't want to be branded as married. Entertaining, political, down-to-earth, they clearly have a great time together; Lewis says that, since he met Klein, he's \"got a lot more serious and had a lot more fun\". Klein grew up with politics all around her. Her grandparents were American Marxists in the 30s and 40s; her grandfather was an animator at Disney who was fired and blacklisted for organising the company's first strike. Her parents, who are also American, moved to Canada in protest at the Vietnam war. Her father is a doctor and her mother, Bonnie Klein, made the seminal anti-pornography film, This Is Not A Love Story, in 1980. \"My mother was really involved in the anti-pornography movement, and when I was at school I found it very oppressive to have a very public feminist mother - it was a source of endless embarrassment. When This Is Not A Love Story came out, there was a lot of backlash against my mother. The headline in the Toronto Globe And Mail was \"Bourgeois Feminist Fascist\", and she was made Hustler magazine's asshole of the month; they took my mother's head and put it on the back of a donkey. It was not cool in 1980 to be making films about pornography. Not at my elementary school, anyway.\" This, she says, is part of the reason she wanted nothing to do with politics when she was growing up. \"I think it's why I embraced full-on consumerism. I was in constant conflict with my parents and I wanted them to leave me the hell alone.\" Her brother, who is two years older, did not go through the same kind of rebellion: \"I don't think he was quite so much a victim of the 80s as I was. We had no culture growing up. We had Cyndi Lauper.\" So, after years of obsession with Barbie, Girl's World and Disneyland, what brought about the change? \"I know the only way that I escaped the mall - which is not to say that I don't ever go, or enjoy it - the only way I got consumerism and vanity into a sane place in my life, though I don't think we are ever rid of them, was just by becoming interested in other things. It's that simple. Saying that you're a bad person for buying this or wanting this only turns people off.\" Klein was all set to go to the University of Toronto to study English and philosophy when her mother had a very severe stroke aged 46. She took a year off to care for her. \"I think that's what stopped me from being such a brat.\" Read part two of Hand-to-brand-combat here \u0095 No Logo, by Naomi Klein, is published by HarperCollins, priced \u00a314.99.

      "body": "<p>Chavignol is a gastronomic Site of Special Scientific Interest. Restaurants in the regions which stand or fall on the reputation of their food alone (ie, without the aid of a health spa or hotel rooms to provide support) are few and far between. Few have the culinary class or financial finesse to last the distance. The battle for better food outside the main metropolitan areas (and, in some cases, within them, too) has been led by the conversion of pubs to the cause of good cooking. But the ambition of a pub, however grand, is defined by its place in our culture. You're unlikely to visit one on the lookout for a senior dining experience. And, let's admit it, every now and then we like to dress up and go out for a treat. </p> <p>If you're lucky, you'll live within striking distance of one of those plush countryhouse hotels that has had the sense to hire a chef of personality and panache. If you're luckier still, you'll live within striking distance of somewhere such as Chavignol, where a chef of considerable talent, backed by a front-of-house team of considerable charm, has created a stand-alone restaurant of considerable ambition. </p> <p>The scale of Chavignol's prices, if nothing else, makes this ambition abundantly clear. First courses start at \u00a38.50 and top out at \u00a310.50. Mains go from \u00a319 to \u00a322.50. The cheapo lunch menu stands at \u00a325, and a seven-course menu gourmand will set you back \u00a348. The bill for Belladonna, Beryl and me topped \u00a3170 - but half of that was wine, in celebration of the success of Belladonna's novel. (Writing books is such a precarious business that it is the first duty of the author's friends to toast any and every occasion.) </p> <p>But, whatever the excuse, when I'm paying that kind of money I have expectations to match. And Marcus Ashenford's cooking was equal to them.

      "bodyText": "Chavignol is a gastronomic Site of Special Scientific Interest. Restaurants in the regions which stand or fall on the reputation of their food alone (ie, without the aid of a health spa or hotel rooms to provide support) are few and far between. Few have the culinary class or financial finesse to last the distance. The battle for better food outside the main metropolitan areas (and, in some cases, within them, too) has been led by the conversion of pubs to the cause of good cooking. But the ambition of a pub, however grand, is defined by its place in our culture. You're unlikely to visit one on the lookout for a senior dining experience. And, let's admit it, every now and then we like to dress up and go out for a treat. If you're lucky, you'll live within striking distance of one of those plush countryhouse hotels that has had the sense to hire a chef of personality and panache. If you're luckier still, you'll live within striking distance of somewhere such as Chavignol, where a chef of considerable talent, backed by a front-of-house team of considerable charm, has created a stand-alone restaurant of considerable ambition. The scale of Chavignol's prices, if nothing else, makes this ambition abundantly clear. First courses start at \u00a38.50 and top out at \u00a310.50. Mains go from \u00a319 to \u00a322.50. The cheapo lunch menu stands at \u00a325, and a seven-course menu gourmand will set you back \u00a348. The bill for Belladonna, Beryl and me topped \u00a3170 - but half of that was wine, in celebration of the success of Belladonna's novel. (Writing books is such a precarious business that it is the first duty of the author's friends to toast any and every occasion.) But, whatever the excuse, when I'm paying that kind of money I have expectations to match. And Marcus Ashenford's cooking was equal to them. His cooking is of the carefully layered variety: a timbale of creamed skate was mixed with grain mustard and had a layer of tomato fondue running through it, a beignet of more skate balanced on its crisp top with a tomato \"tartare\" (their inverted commas) style vinaigrette. Belladonna had a terrine of wood pigeon and foie gras with a salad of leeks and hazelnuts, spiced fig sauce and brioche; Beryl a poached duck on buttered spinach plonked inside the roasted base of an artichoke, with bits of fried herring roe and a chive and beetroot infusion. These dishes are wrought (if stopping just short of being highly wrought), baroque without being rococo. The plating arrangements combined the contemporary passion for a bit of height, with dishes rising like Mont-St-Michel from a flat plain zigzagged with sauces. This is difficult stuff to pull off.

It may be on impulse, which satisfies a craving and is fine at the time, but you need to resign yourself to admitting frequent mistakes. Then there is the calculated purchase. Here there are many factors that should affect a decision - especially if there is an enormous range of varieties to choose from. </p> <p>With hemerocallis, for instance: don't (if you can help yourself) simply get carried away by the size or colouring of the bloom. Many large-flowered varieties charge a high price by not being productive. Small-flowered kinds are often far freer (which goes for many other flowers, such as clematis and chrysanthemums). Another frequent fault with day lilies is that size of flower goes hand in hand with size and dominance of leaf. Leaves are not this genus's strong point (except sometimes in youth). If they are broad and coarse, you will notice this. Third frequent fault: the flowering stems may be too short for a well-balanced plant. The inflorescence should stand elegantly, and well above the foliage, not be buried down among it, as in the unduly popular 'Stella de Oro'. Another fault with this cultivar, which may also be observed in other flowers, is that its very long flowering season is compensated for by its never making a good display at any one time. </p> <p>There is a nice question of balance, here. Many red-hot pokers, kniphofia, make a stunning display that may completely bowl you over if you happen to strike it at its big moment, but this is virtually over in a fortnight. Other kniphofias, with a reasonably extended flowering season that is also reasonably intense throughout, may well be preferable (but do be sure to dead-head the early blooms before they spoil the setting for those that come later). </p> <p>Likewise, there are some heleniums that flower quite late, in August-September, and make a great show but offer little succession of flower bud. By contrast in this respect is a very old variety, 'Moerheim Beauty', which has a great flush of its bronze blossom in July, takes a short breath and then (especially if you dead-headed the first crop) does it again for several weeks from late August. The fact that its daisies are not of a perfectly regular shape seems not to matter at all. </p> <p>'Moerheim Beauty' is a convenient 1.3m tall. Some of the late varieties are well over 2m and, as they face resolutely skywards, you may not be able to get a good view of them except from above, as it might be from a terrace (or helicopter). Sunflowers (helianthus) on the other hand, and many other members of the daisy family, look towards the sun, which means to the south in the northern hemisphere. If you are planting a border running east-west and are viewing it from the north side, all these daisies will be turning their backs on you. That is a grave mistake. And it points to the folly, where double borders running east-west are being planted, of aiming to have a balance of content. Keep your daisies (and other heliotropic flowers) to the north border. </p> <p>Plants with nodding flowers, as with some annual helianthus, may have an advantage if the plants grow very tall. They will look benignly down on you. But some modern seed strains that are dwarf still have nodding daisies, which is no use to anyone once past early childhood. </p> <p>Do your delphiniums have an even distribution of flowers along the spike, and is the spike itself strong enough not to get bent in the wind? In both cases the answer will be no more often than yes, if the plants have been raised from seed. They are fun to grow this way, but you must be prepared for many duds and it's really no use being indulgent towards them simply because they are of your own raising. Named varieties that have received an Award of Garden Merit on the RHS trial grounds will pass these tests. They will need good support, certainly, but this should never be necessary any higher than the start of the flowering spike. </p> <p>The habit of a plant is important. There is a currently popular grass, Hakonechloa macra 'Auriola', low growing and in beautiful yellow (and green) shades from spring to autumn, its role being that of a foliage plant. But its leaves all arch over in the same direction and there is an overall flatness about a patch of it. Through mine, I grow a 1m-tall variegated grass, Spartina pectinata 'Aureovariegata', which is stiffly upright and makes a contrasting break. It has a running rootstock, but that is easily controlled by yanking out unwanted shoots. </p> <p>Finally dead heads. These may be extremely offensive, especially in double-flowered cultivars, such as coreopsis, camellias, roses and chrysanthemums. There may be no alternative to frequent dead-heading, but if you are realistic you will realise that you simply will not get around to doing the job as often as is necessary, especially with a large shrub such as a camellia, much of which cannot be reached without steps. Many doting owners (especially those of white camellias or of roses with French names that can be rolled nonchalantly off the tongue) seem blind to their darlings' glaring faults, but if they were sensible (impossible all the time, I realise) they would go in for varieties that either die gracefully on the plant or shed their petals when fading.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Labour's slump in the opinion polls has been matched by a sharp fall in support for the single currency, according to an opinion poll published yesterday, making a referendum on British membership increasingly difficult for the government to win. Before the fuel crisis and controversy over financing of the Millennium Dome, Labour voters opposed to EMU entry were prepared to give the party the benefit of the doubt about the consequences of ditching the pound. But, with the party's reputation for strong government dented, they are now much more sceptical, the Mori poll suggests. The poll, for the investment bank Schroder Salomon Smith Barney, shows overall opposition to the single currency has hardened, with a balance of 29% saying they would vote No if a referendum were held today, up from 20% in July. A strong campaign by the government in favour of joining would make little difference to the result, with a balance of 22% saying they would continue to vote No, up from 10% in July. Michael Saunders, head of the bank's European economic team, said two main factors were at work. First, Britain's economic backdrop of steady growth and falling unemployment had undermined the argument of the pro-EMU camp that Britain will suffer outside the eurozone. Second, the fuel crisis and the dome's woes had hit support for the government and it policies. \"The swing against both EMU and the government suggest that the UK remains unlikely to hold an EMU referendum in the next few years,\" Mr Saunders said. \"In the run-up to the election, the government will want to focus on populist measures, such as extra money for pensioners, more public spending, a tax cut in the early 2001 Budget - and probably some gesture to lower fuel taxes.\"",

That means all of us, however green our individual credentials.</p> <p>As in any market, the oil price is set by the marginal buyer and seller. Opec's traditional price-smoothing activities aside, supply of oil is notoriously inelastic: it can only respond slowly to price changes. Demand, however, is driven directly by general economic activity. The result is high volatility.</p> <p>It is no wonder the oil price has surged, for the global economy has enjoyed a sustained upswing. Its engine has been a US economy that is now in its 10th year of uninterrupted expansion, placing strain on all raw resources - particularly labour. A rise in input prices is one of the economy's self-correcting mechanisms. Higher costs feed through to a combination of lower profit margins and higher output prices. Both have the effect of cooling activity, in turn easing demand for raw materials.</p> <p>Governments typically attempt to make this circle more vicious by raising interest rates and cutting their own spending so as to take the heat out of the economy. Such attempts often backfire, but usually because complex economic circumstances have been misread, not because the theory is wrong.</p> <p><b> Shifting balance</b><br></p> <p>An economy's spoils are shared between four parties: the providers of raw materials, labour and capital as well as government. The last is principally a redistributor between the other three but, depending on the state of its own finances and its tactics, it can alter the total accruing to the others.</p> <p>Leaving the showboating about fuel taxes where it belongs - to one side - the current debate about economic management clearly illustrates the shifting of the economic balance away from capital.</p> <p>The minutes of the September meeting of the monetary policy committee revealed a marginal vote in favour of leaving interest rates at 6%. The resolutely hawkish minority in favour of dearer money fears - yes, you guessed it - the effect of higher wages and more expensive oil.</p> <p>The chancellor finds hordes of under-employed and insecure Labour backbenchers rooting around in his supposed war chest. The rosy state of the country's finances is only secondarily the result of his much-vaunted prudence. Primarily it is a natural consequence of the economic upswing.</p> <p>The US election is being fought over the issue of how to spend the \"growth bounty\" generated by the American economy over the past 10 years. The British election will see much of the same.</p> <p>Just when the economic barbecue should be dampened, politicians with low security of tenure are about to squirt it with lighter fuel. There could not be a better advertisement for a command economy. Or, failing that, proportional representation.</p> <p>Workers of every collar colour might be forgiven for asking why the tightening labour market is not working for them. It is, but the fluidity of modern working practices has introduced permanent job insecurity for all.</p> <p>Western economies are moving closer and closer to full employment. Companies worry increasingly about the availability of labour. The trick for employers and government is to ensure that, through training, workers are recycled to mitigate the general inflationary consequences.</p> <p>America has performed this trick on a sustained basis throughout its upswing. Europe lacks the cultural characteristics of the American people, which have facilitated its seemingly miraculous growth. A frontier spirit has encouraged labour mobility across US state boundaries and across its industries to a degree as yet alien to the United States of Europe.</p> <p>From the perspective of the providers of capital - investors - the emerging labour market problem has been containable, because overall activity has been expanding. Running plants faster and sweating employees harder has overcome the rise in the cost of individual workers.</p> <p><b> Just too tough</b><br></p> <p>With general inflation in the economy low, profits have been driven ahead by volume growth and a focus on efficiency. But the rise in oil prices has upset the delicate balance. There is one ball too many for the corporate jugglers to keep aloft.</p> <p>September has been marked by profit warnings from companies around the globe. The reasons cited are specific to the companies concerned but collectively they give the impression that corporate life is just too tough right now. Which is what the economic textbooks would predict.</p> <p>It is difficult to see a renewed upturn in profits growth, short of a swift reversal in oil prices and the surprise discovery of a generation of highly trained young workers hidden in a remote mountain state.</p> <p>While share prices do not always follow profit announcements - expectations are the key - the current wave of gloomy tidings has washed away investors' late summer confidence.</p> <p>So share prices are falling, down 7% in Britain so far this month, taking the FTSE 100 to 7% below its level at the start of the year. Worse before better, I'd guess.</p>",

A rise in input prices is one of the economy's self-correcting mechanisms. Higher costs feed through to a combination of lower profit margins and higher output prices. Both have the effect of cooling activity, in turn easing demand for raw materials. Governments typically attempt to make this circle more vicious by raising interest rates and cutting their own spending so as to take the heat out of the economy. Such attempts often backfire, but usually because complex economic circumstances have been misread, not because the theory is wrong. Shifting balance An economy's spoils are shared between four parties: the providers of raw materials, labour and capital as well as government. The last is principally a redistributor between the other three but, depending on the state of its own finances and its tactics, it can alter the total accruing to the others. Leaving the showboating about fuel taxes where it belongs - to one side - the current debate about economic management clearly illustrates the shifting of the economic balance away from capital. The minutes of the September meeting of the monetary policy committee revealed a marginal vote in favour of leaving interest rates at 6%. The resolutely hawkish minority in favour of dearer money fears - yes, you guessed it - the effect of higher wages and more expensive oil. The chancellor finds hordes of under-employed and insecure Labour backbenchers rooting around in his supposed war chest. The rosy state of the country's finances is only secondarily the result of his much-vaunted prudence. Primarily it is a natural consequence of the economic upswing. The US election is being fought over the issue of how to spend the \"growth bounty\" generated by the American economy over the past 10 years. The British election will see much of the same. Just when the economic barbecue should be dampened, politicians with low security of tenure are about to squirt it with lighter fuel. There could not be a better advertisement for a command economy. Or, failing that, proportional representation. Workers of every collar colour might be forgiven for asking why the tightening labour market is not working for them. It is, but the fluidity of modern working practices has introduced permanent job insecurity for all. Western economies are moving closer and closer to full employment. Companies worry increasingly about the availability of labour. The trick for employers and government is to ensure that, through training, workers are recycled to mitigate the general inflationary consequences. America has performed this trick on a sustained basis throughout its upswing. Europe lacks the cultural characteristics of the American people, which have facilitated its seemingly miraculous growth. A frontier spirit has encouraged labour mobility across US state boundaries and across its industries to a degree as yet alien to the United States of Europe. From the perspective of the providers of capital - investors - the emerging labour market problem has been containable, because overall activity has been expanding. Running plants faster and sweating employees harder has overcome the rise in the cost of individual workers. Just too tough With general inflation in the economy low, profits have been driven ahead by volume growth and a focus on efficiency. But the rise in oil prices has upset the delicate balance. There is one ball too many for the corporate jugglers to keep aloft. September has been marked by profit warnings from companies around the globe. The reasons cited are specific to the companies concerned but collectively they give the impression that corporate life is just too tough right now. Which is what the economic textbooks would predict. It is difficult to see a renewed upturn in profits growth, short of a swift reversal in oil prices and the surprise discovery of a generation of highly trained young workers hidden in a remote mountain state. While share prices do not always follow profit announcements - expectations are the key - the current wave of gloomy tidings has washed away investors' late summer confidence. So share prices are falling, down 7% in Britain so far this month, taking the FTSE 100 to 7% below its level at the start of the year. Worse before better, I'd guess.",

      "bodyText": "Neighbours and relatives of the conjoined twins' parents filed into their village church on the Maltese island of Gozo last night to pray for the soul of the ill-fated baby Mary. News of the appeal court's decision spread rapidly through farms, homes and cafes, dividing the community into relief and dismay. Villagers who welcomed the ruling to separate the twins mingled with priests and tearful relatives who backed the parents' desire to keep them together. Gozo, is the second largest island in the Maltese archipelago, a former British colony 90 miles south of Sicily. Bishop Nikol Cauchi said it was a \"dark day\" for the overwhelmingly Catholic island and the church, which opposed the operation because, although it is expected to save Jodie, her sister Mary will die. \"We are very sorry. The operation, the act of it, causes us dismay. We do not criticise the judges themselves but we abhor the act. The judges are human beings and make mistakes.\" He denied suggestions made by the parents in a court submission, that Jodie would be stigmatised because of her disability. \"Whether they return to the village with one or two children, everyone - both the community and the church - will embrace them.

Both babies will die otherwise, so it makes sense to save one,\" said a retired taxi driver. \"I don't blame the parents for wanting to let nature take its course but I'm glad the court did what it did.\" Doctors at Saint Luke's general hospital, near the parents' home, expressed confidence in having the resources to care for Jodie. Despite a court order protecting their identity, islanders knew about the disastrous pregnancy even before the couple left for Britain in March, to receive specialised treatment. Most work in agriculture and tourism and speak both English and Maltese. Many said the courts should never have become involved. \"Only parents can decide such things,\" said Martha, a council worker. \"I don't know if there is anyone to blame but in the end I hoped the judges would see sense and respect the parents' wishes.\" The village priest, his eyes moist, led parishioners in prayer at evening mass.

Several ethicists have argued forcefully that cases such as this, where there is perhaps no right or wrong answer, should not come to court in the first place but be left for those most closely affected - in this case the parents. Dr Richard Nicholson, editor of the Bulletin of Medical Ethics, argues that over the last 10 years the family division has found itself adjudicating in cases which should by rights be left within the family. He also believes that the court is tending to side with the professionals - be they social workers or doctors - rather than those who stand to lose most by the decision. \"Surely we have to give great power and credence to the parents,\" he argues. As medical technology develops and doctors can do more to keep patients alive in the most extraordinary circumstances, it is certainly becoming more common for the medical profession to turn to the courts for adjudication. The Catholic church has been quick to see the potential difficulties increased medical expertise is creating. It has set up its own healthcare ethics centre - the Linacre centre in London - to keep abreast of developments.

      "body": "<p>The BBC's plans to move the Nine O'Clock News to 10pm appeared untenable last night after Chris Smith, the culture secretary, made it clear he was opposed to the move. </p> <p>After ITV staged a surprising u-turn and agreed to restore News at Ten to the schedules following a two-year battle with television regulators, Mr Smith urged the BBC to rethink its proposal. </p> <p>He welcomed ITV's decision to air the nightly news for 20 minutes at 10pm on at least three days a week, although he would have preferred it five days a week. </p> <p>Asked whether the BBC should now abandon plans to move the Nine O'Clock News he told BBC News 24: \"I hope the BBC will now have a think about that because having a head-to-head conflict between the main news bulletins of the BBC and the ITV I don't think would make sense.\" </p> <p>Mr Smith has no direct say over BBC schedules - the plan must be approved by the BBC governors. But the wider proposals to launch a set of new channels outlined by the director general, Greg Dyke, this year require the agreement of the culture secretary.

      "bodyText": "The BBC's plans to move the Nine O'Clock News to 10pm appeared untenable last night after Chris Smith, the culture secretary, made it clear he was opposed to the move. After ITV staged a surprising u-turn and agreed to restore News at Ten to the schedules following a two-year battle with television regulators, Mr Smith urged the BBC to rethink its proposal. He welcomed ITV's decision to air the nightly news for 20 minutes at 10pm on at least three days a week, although he would have preferred it five days a week. Asked whether the BBC should now abandon plans to move the Nine O'Clock News he told BBC News 24: \"I hope the BBC will now have a think about that because having a head-to-head conflict between the main news bulletins of the BBC and the ITV I don't think would make sense.\" Mr Smith has no direct say over BBC schedules - the plan must be approved by the BBC governors. But the wider proposals to launch a set of new channels outlined by the director general, Greg Dyke, this year require the agreement of the culture secretary. Observers believe this makes it hard for Mr Dyke to defy Mr Smith's views over the Nine O'Clock News. Mr Dyke and the new controller of BBC1, Lorraine Heggessey, are placed in a difficult position by ITV's move. The decision to shift the BBC evening news to 10pm would have allowed Ms Heggessey to schedule hit drama and entertainment shows at 9pm, in an effort to stem BBC1's ratings decline.

The Financial Ombudsman Service has already received 5,000 formal complaints about mortgage shortfalls - 50% of the total caseload.

Then everyone with an endowment loan should have received a letter reviewing the policy and have had time to consider its implications. </p> <p>But Ilford-based lawyer Joseph Aaron is not waiting. He is organising his clients around a legal fighting fund. He aims to force the insurers to make up the shortfall - and pay the promised tax-free lump sum. In one case, he is fighting for a client with endowments designed to produce \u00a31.5m but now unlikely to top \u00a31m. </p> <p>Mr Aaron, who is also an insurance expert, says he first became interested in the mortgage shortfall issue earlier this year. \"We do a lot of mortgage-related work and we saw an increasing number of clients threatened with shortfalls.

Then it spread by word of mouth and now I have in excess of 100 who want to fight their insurers through the courts,\" he says. </p> <p>The average shortfall is around \u00a315,000, with only a small minority above \u00a330,000. Mr Aaron says his \u00a31m client is \"unusual for the amount but not the percentage - most people will be around a quarter to a third short of their target.\" </p> <p>Each client is putting between \u00a3375 and \u00a3475 into a fighting fund depending on the size of their projected shortfall. But Mr Aaron is not just fighting for the shortfall. He says he intends to sue for the tax-free lump sum which was used as a bait to get people to buy endowments. Promised surpluses often amounted to around a quar ter of the final payout. </p> <p>\"We intend to bypass the Financial Services Authority and the Ombudsman and take the fight directly to the insurers. Either they pay up or we go to court,\" he says. The case will revolve around claims of negligence and dereliction of duty. </p> <p>The first attack will attempt to establish that banks, building societies and other sellers were negligent in not pointing out the risks of equities and bonds, the main contents of with-profits plans. </p> <p>\"They must have known there was a risk - it is hardly new,\" says Mr Aaron. \"Letters were sent out referring to mortgage payment plans and plans designed to pay off home loans. Whatever small-print caveats there might have been, an ordinary person reading this would believe one thing.

Some have been targeted by protesters at presentations and recruitment fairs, while others have been through periods of intense scrutiny in the media. </p> <p>But does negative campaigning or negative publicity have any effect on the ability of these companies to attract the graduates they need to prosper and survive? </p> <p>Over the years, many companies have held the unofficial position of most despised capitalist organisation. In the late 80s it was Barclays, during the 90s it was Nike, Shell and even Microsoft, but at present the flame has passed into the hands of McDonald's, one of the few companies to have attracted protests at graduate recruitment fairs. </p> <p>Although about a quarter of its restaurant management teams have degrees, McDonald's is not a mainstream graduate recruiter. It has a general management training scheme rather than one specifically aimed at graduates, and it recruits throughout the year rather than following the milk round. </p> <p>Careers fairs are, however, important in maintaining the company's profile among students, and it is this that has led to it being targeted by protesters. </p> <p>Though there were no protests at the most recent fair in Manchester, those staffing the McDonald's stand felt that students had initially been wary - yet this, they say quickly turned to considerable interest. This claim is backed up by the company's performance in this year's UK Graduate Careers Survey which saw McDonald's moving up 16 places to become 43rd in the list of the top 100 employers. The other company most likely to attract protesters at careers events is BAe Systems, but like McDonald's, this appears to make no difference to its ability to attract students. </p> <p>\"We have no difficulty attracting and recruiting graduates,\" says Charlie Miller, spokesperson for BAe Systems. \"This year's target was 400. We had 14,000 applications and have made 320 offers so far. Next year, we aim to recruit 520. We have also consolidated our position in the UK Graduate Careers Survey and are top in terms of engineering companies. </p> <p>\"Although we are aware of strategic issues and are committed to recruiting across a variety of groups, we remain employer of choice in our target market.\" </p> <p>This illustrates one of the reasons why negative campaigning appears to have so little effect. Protests have no impact on the students who are actually interested in joining these companies. </p> <p>\"We are dealing with two very different populations,\" says Martin Birchall, survey director of High Fliers Research, the organisation which produces the Graduate Careers Survey. \"Among engineers, for example it is recognised that most major companies will have environmental or social-political issues, and the decision to seek employment with them will not be influenced by protests. </p> <p>\"The protesters on the other hand come from a completely different section of the student population, if indeed they are students at all. I have known protesters to be booed out of presentations which they have tried to disrupt, and in fact the company may gain greater respect from potential recruits for the way it handles the situation.\" </p> <p>If negative campaigning does not dissuade students from applying to companies, what then is the effect of negative publicity? BNFL is a company with experience of both problems. For a long time it was the target of environmental protests, while more recently its performance has been questioned in the media when irregularities were found in its quality monitoring procedures. </p> <p>\"I don't think it made a big difference,\" says Sue Stockton, head of people and organisation development at BNFL. \"Once people have made up their mind and are in the process, they don't tend to withdraw or reject offers when they're made. </p> <p>\"More generally however, hiring has been more difficult over the past two years, but I would put this down to greater competition for science and engineering graduates, a situation which is compounded by the fact that we are looking for more of them (up by 20% this year). </p> <p>\"We haven't changed our strategy, however, and still offer a very competitive package, a good training programme, national and international locations, and the opportunity to work with leading-edge projects.\" </p> <p>BNFL has also risen in the rankings, and Martin Birchall suggests that, apart from one other factor, it is only negative business stories that influence student choice. \"First, the graduate market is won or lost on the quantity of promotions a company undertakes,\" he says, \"but the second factor that influences applicants is the business environment. If applicants believe that a particular sector or a particular company is facing difficulties, then recruitment becomes more difficult. Bad business stories put graduates off.\" </p> <p>Although there is anecdotal evidence that ethical practice can also have a negative impact on recruitment (the actions of oil companies in the developing world are sometimes cited as an example), there are even cases where companies in very public crises continue to attract graduates. </p> <p>In 1995 and 1996 Yorkshire Water was the butt of national jokes for its difficulties during the drought, while within its catchment area company employees were openly despised. Despite this, the company still managed to recruit the usual number of applicants. </p> <p>The only difficulty it experienced was in retaining new graduates, and this was probably due to the fact that the company's energies were focused on the delivery of water rather than the training scheme. </p> <p>It doesn't seem to matter whether a company is criticised or in crisis: if it is perceived to be successful, it will always attract graduates. </p> <p> <strong> UK Graduate Careers Survey</strong> </p> <p> This is undertaken on behalf of 28 leading graduate recruiters. This year's survey interviewed 10,650 students from 25 universities who were asked to name which employer gave the best opportunities to graduates. The results are then compiled into a chart showing the top 100 in order of popularity. </p>",

If applicants believe that a particular sector or a particular company is facing difficulties, then recruitment becomes more difficult. Bad business stories put graduates off.\" Although there is anecdotal evidence that ethical practice can also have a negative impact on recruitment (the actions of oil companies in the developing world are sometimes cited as an example), there are even cases where companies in very public crises continue to attract graduates. In 1995 and 1996 Yorkshire Water was the butt of national jokes for its difficulties during the drought, while within its catchment area company employees were openly despised. Despite this, the company still managed to recruit the usual number of applicants. The only difficulty it experienced was in retaining new graduates, and this was probably due to the fact that the company's energies were focused on the delivery of water rather than the training scheme. It doesn't seem to matter whether a company is criticised or in crisis: if it is perceived to be successful, it will always attract graduates. UK Graduate Careers Survey This is undertaken on behalf of 28 leading graduate recruiters. This year's survey interviewed 10,650 students from 25 universities who were asked to name which employer gave the best opportunities to graduates. The results are then compiled into a chart showing the top 100 in order of popularity.",

Some 170 town and city administrations in Germany had called on motorists not to drive to work. They accounted for about a quarter of all the local authorities taking part across Europe. But the majority of Germans ignored the call. From Hamburg, Frankfurt and Stuttgart, traffic police reported a normal flow of vehicles. A spokesman for the Hamburg police called it \"just like any other Friday\". In Berlin, where the council had dodged the issue by shifting \"car-free day\" to Sunday, Greens staged a protest at the Brandenburg gate. John Hooper in Berlin Greece Yesterday's car-free initiative brought respite from a pall of brownish-yellow smog that had been hanging over the city since Wednesday, when pollution approached emergency levels. There was something of a carnival atmosphere in the normally traffic-clogged Greek capital as the government declared a car-free zone in the so-called \"historic triangle\", which includes the Acropolis and the ancient Agora. Public transport throughout Athens was free, while bicycles were available in the downtown area. More than 60 towns and cities across Greece also participated in the event. Michael Howard in Athens Israel A rare silence reigned in central Tel Aviv, normally one large traffic snarl-up, on Israel's first no-car event yesterday. Despite predictions in most Israeli newspapers that the experiment would fizzle, few dared to break the ban on private transport in the centre of the city. Fridays are considered a semi-official day off in Israel, with the Jewish sabbath beginning at sunset, and many people in Tel Aviv simply started the weekend early. \"I can sit in my home and there is no noise,\" said Rachel Horam, an activist with the committee for public transportation. \"Everyone was complaining beforehand that they could not manage without cars, but now they are walking the streets, they can see the benefit of it all.\" Suzanne Goldenberg",

The first European Car Day aimed to encourage people throughout the continent to abandon their cars for other forms of transport and open up the streets for outdoor entertainment, clean air and public space. But only 10 of Britain's 175 local authorities took part in the initiative, among them five of the 33 London boroughs. The Environmental Transport Association, which organised the day in Britain, said it was disappointed that more towns did not take part. In addition, the British government is the only EU government not to have signed a charter supporting the day. In central London, only a handful of roads were closed to traffic. Camden in north London barred cars in one area of Covent Garden and invited restaurants and cafes to spill out on to the pavement. Salsa dancing, theatre, music and haircutting filled a Brixton street which usually carries heavy traffic and a road near Waterloo was transformed into a street market. Merton, in the south west of the capital, grassed over a road for children to play on, and the borough of Sutton extended a pedestrianised area to accommodate cafes and a speakers' corner. More than 300 cyclists from six corners of London rode through drizzle to Trafalgar square yesterday morning before performing a lap of honour around Nelson's Column. Mary Richardson, from Brixton, who has used a bicycle as her main form of transport for two years, said that she has become addicted to cycling. \"My bike's my best friend.

Not all supermarkets deliver nationwide, so putting in your postcode will establish if your chosen store operates in your area. It will also pinpoint which branch will do the delivery and make sure you only get that branch's shopping list - avoiding a situation where you merrily pick products stocked in the out-of-town hypermarket only to discover that the inner-city branch which will be serving you has only a quarter of the goods in stock. </p> <p>You then go into the supermarket's lists and click on the items you want. Once you've finished, just enter your delivery details and choose a time for the goods to be dropped off. </p> <p>It's at this stage that the service varies from store to store. With <a href=\"http://www.sainsburys.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Sainsbury's</a>, for example, you can enter your credit card details while you are ordering. But with <a href=\"http://www.asda.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">Asda</a>, you pay the driver who delivers your goods. There are also slight variations on the delivery times offered by each supermarket. Most have an order deadline ranging from noon to 4pm for next day delivery. Some charge \u00a35 per delivery and others \u00a33 or even nothing. </p> <p>Some will deliver between 9am and 9pm, others between 8am and 10pm. Some work seven days a week, while others are shut on Sundays. Most will ask you to choose a two-hour time slot on a delivery day when someone will need to be at home. </p> <p>However, some, such as Simply Organic Food, will leave your order in the garden shed or with a neighbour. All you have to do is leave special instructions for the driver when you are processing your order. </p> <p> The more specialised the company, the more likely it is that you will have to be flexible on delivery times. If you're ordering pork from Farmers Market Direct, for example, and have just missed out on one batch of pigs being slaughtered, you may have to wait a few days for the next batch to go. The pay-off is that the meat is guaranteed to be British, from the same source you bought it from last time, and reared in accordance with the RSPCA's Freedom Food Welfare Scheme. </p> <p>Whoever you shop with, you should be able to save your shopping list file, so you don't have to scour the website for your most popular buys each time you place an order - supermarkets offer around 25,000 products, but most customers buy only 250 different ones in a year. You should also be able to save delivery and payment details, lessening the amount of time you spend online each time you order. Similarly, most of the nationwide supermarkets let online shoppers collect points on their store loyalty cards, although at present you have to redeem them in one of the shops. </p> <p>The main downside of online grocery shopping is that if you log on during the peak evening and weekend times, or have a slow modem on your computer, you may find yourself sitting in front of your monitor for several hours, wondering whether the queues at the check-out could possibly be worse. </p> <p>In addition, the delivery slots are allocated on a first-come first-serve basis.

No, the real problem this time is not inside the hall: it is outside.</p> <p>The party gathers at its lowest ebb since Tony Blair became leader. The polls show the Tories ahead, for the first time since 1992. The once all-conquering team of Mr Blair and Gordon Brown now appear unfamiliarly defensive: the former wobbling during the fuel crisis, the latter forced to tour the TV studios to prove that he did not lie over the Bernie Ecclestone affair three years ago. The problems have piled on at merciless speed, with the first signs of panic beginning to spread to the backbenches.

      "bodyText": "Just for once the biggest headache at the Labour party conference won't be the Labour party. For leaders past, the challenge of the annual seaside conference came from restless delegates and frustrated activists, spoiling for a fight. That probably won't be the case at the gathering which starts in Brighton tomorrow. There had threatened to be a couple of showdowns on pensions and asylum seekers, but both those grievances ought to be seen off before they erupt into all-out floor fights. No, the real problem this time is not inside the hall: it is outside. The party gathers at its lowest ebb since Tony Blair became leader. The polls show the Tories ahead, for the first time since 1992. The once all-conquering team of Mr Blair and Gordon Brown now appear unfamiliarly defensive: the former wobbling during the fuel crisis, the latter forced to tour the TV studios to prove that he did not lie over the Bernie Ecclestone affair three years ago. The problems have piled on at merciless speed, with the first signs of panic beginning to spread to the backbenches. Even loyal Blairites have begun to think the once unthinkable: what about... defeat? More worrying, too many Labour advocates have floundered in recent days. In TV debates they have seemed barely able to defend the government against the now-cliched charges of arrogance and incompetence.

He is the country's most successful post-war chancellor and will ride out the storms. The case against: he is too clever by half, his arrogant mistakes have badly damaged Labour, and he will not be able to escape responsibility for Labour falling behind the Tories in the polls. Both descriptions could be heard about Gordon Brown over recent days as friends and foes took up positions to attack or defend the chancellor. Besieged on three fronts, he has just endured his worst week at the Treasury, eclipsing even the single currency fiasco when the government's euro policy was announced across the road in the Red Lion public house. The most vocal critics have been the Tories, with their newfound trucker allies. Yet as Labour prepared for tomorrow's start of its conference in Brighton, the enemy appeared at times to be \"colleagues\" seizing the opportunity to settle more than a few scores. Cabinet ministers, MPs and some in No 10 blame him for the petrol crisis, complaining he failed to spot it coming and provoked the protesters and public by taking a tough line against cuts in duty. Barbara Castle and Jack Jones, formidable champions for higher pensions, were at his Monday night wedding reception demanding not champagne but the restoration of the link with earnings. And then Brown was accused of lying in Labour's biggest sleaze scandal. This was avalanche politics. He had gone from hero to virtually zero within two months as the man lauded in July for a \u00a343bn vote-winning spending spree was being accused in September of risking electoral defeat. Brown's package for pensioners, his TV interviews, and yesterday's decision to risk the wrath of europhobic newspapers by propping up the euro, suggest he knows he must come out fighting. At stake are his belief in higher public spending over tax cuts, and ultimately his ambition to succeed Tony Blair, which would almost certainly require him to remain chancellor after the next election with Blair stepping down mid-way through the parliament. Close aides concede Brown has felt under pressure but insist he has not panicked, juggling the three problems in the search for solutions. The only time he was angry, they maintain, was on Wednesday, when ITN's 6.30pm news ran with the Tory charges that he had run away to Malta to escape. \"He was really annoyed,\" said the aide. \"Gordon had got up at 5.30am, flew to Malta for a Commonwealth finance ministers' meeting, and got back in the Treasury at 5.20pm, less than 12 hours later.

His friends ask where is the long queue of virtuous ministers, snaking around Westminster, volunteering to take the blame whenever anything goes wrong? Brown's survival instincts are strong, however, and in the fall-out over controversial cuts in single parent benefit he backed shortly after Labour's May 1997 win, a hapless Harriet Harman was left to carry the can. Some of those closest to him whisper conspiratorially, however, that in the strange case of Bernie Ecclestone, Brown not so much fled the scene of the crime but was fitted up - thrown the \u00a31m in the back of the prime minister's car so his fingerprints were left all over the cash. According to those peddling this line, Blair showed what a consummate operator he is by leaving Brown in no position to push him under one of Ecclestone's F1 cars. \"Gordon should have told Blair's driver to stop the car, jumped out and walked back to the Treasury,\" said an associate. \"But what could he do when Tony asked his advice? By even knowing there was a problem he became part of the problem. He's still kicking himself.\" Brown's George Washingon defence - \"I would not lie\" - was bolstered by Andrew Rawnsley misquoting the chancellor in his book Servants of the People. Brown was not so much angry as furious that he was put in the frame for Ecclestone and, as his aides admit, when mud is thrown some always sticks. If Blair and Brown recognise they sink or swim together, Brown and Peter Mandelson remain at daggers drawn and the briefing and counter-briefing will continue. A No 10 \"poison\" squad has been blamed for the Ecclestone allegations. Petrol is Brown's biggest problem and he is going out of his way last week to stress he has a driving licence and owns a car to counter claims he is anti-motorist. Demonstrators are clamouring for his head - Michael Portillo made a mistake demanding his resignation over the Ecclestone charges rather than fuel; he ensured Brown was safe - and Labour MPs echo the complaints of constituents that prices are too high. Brown may be playing the old trick of publicly offering little while privately planning to pull something rout of the bag in November's pre-budget statement if oil prices continue to rise. Defying the petrol demonstrators' 60-day deadline is risky; to offer the drivers nothing would be extremely dangerous. As a Northern MP put it: \"He has got more cash coming in then he knows what to do with it so why jeopardise a second term for 3p a litre? We are stuck in a cul-de-sac over fuel and we have to reverse our way out.\" He will be in Brighton next week for barely 12 hours for the second year running, flying into Britain from the IMF in Prague, making his speech then flying back to the Czech capital.

One hears all the time that the government is \"giving\" the pensioners such and such, that the pension should not go to those who \"do not need it\". We are being brainwashed into regarding the state pension as a charity.</p> <p>State pension contributions are compulsory, the pension one receives is not a handout that should eventually disappear except for the very poor (a view that has been floated by both major parties and is being implemented by stealth).</p> <p>The alleviation of the scandal of poverty among pensioners in Britain has to be addressed, but not by misappropriating the contributions of those who have an additional pension but are far from well off. <br><b>David Andrews</b><br> Glasgow <a href=\"mailto: andrews@oslo.fsnet.co.uk\">andrews@oslo.fsnet.co.uk </a></p> <p>\u0095Polly Toynbee urges the government to introduce a minimum \u00a390 pension in April. This is the level the basic National Insurance pension would have reached if the link with earnings had been sustained. Moreover among couples in which the wife had a full contribution record (including up to 20 years looking after children) each would be getting \u00a390. However, the Minimum Income Guarantee only provides couples with 160% of MIG. Evidence from research on pensioners' income and expenditure by the Basic Income Group shows that apart from housing costs, an adequate income for couples is close to twice that of single pensioners. Many poorer pensioners receive housing benefit.</p> <p>I hope Polly Toynbee continues to urge the government to \"promise a \u00a3100 for every pensioner for 2002\" even if she does not accept that the best way to achieve this is by restoring the earnings' link for the basic state pension. <br> <b> Hilary Land </b> School for Policy Studies, Bristol <br><a href=\"mailto:Hilary.Land@bristol.ac.uk\">Hilary.Land@bristol.ac.uk</a></p> <p>\u0095Polly Toynbee misses the point. There are two principal ways to achieve a redistribution of income: progressive taxation and means testing. The problem is that while most people are in favour of a more equal society, both taxes and means testing tend to be unpopular. Despite this, the left have hitherto favoured the former and the right the latter. Restoring the pensions- earnings link need not redistribute from poor to rich, provided the rich are taxed more progressively. A more generous MIG may limit inequalities at the bottom of income distribution, while leaving them intact at the top. It is only because New Labour has foresworn the possibility of higher taxes on higher incomes that it must resort to means-tested assistance for the poorest. <br><b> Prof Hartley Dean </b><br> University of Luton<br><a href=\"mailto:  hartley.dean@luton.ac.uk\">hartley.dean@luton.ac.uk</a></p> <p>\u0095Polly Toynbee is wrong to claim that the minimum pension is no more charity than the state pension. The National Insurance pension is the right of every working person. The government claim that higher income pensioners do not \"need\" their NI pensions is nonsense.</p> <p>As for the MIG, all means-tested benefits which claimants experience as administrative discretion risk being felt as \"state charity\" and rejected by some eligible people. The government is incapable of solving this problem, and why should it? If it wants to be inclusive, it ought not to use means tests to solve the problems of poverty.</p> <p>If the government wants to deal with the problem of higher income pensioners having too much money because they contributed both to occupational as well as NI pension schemes, and may have other income creating assets, then they should tax more heavily at higher income levels. At the very least, they should increase the NI pensions to decency levels at the Family Budget Unit recommendations and \"clawback\" the increase from richer pensioners to arrive at the desired outcome that low total income pensioners get more benefits by right and higher ones get it but don't keep it. It is far more efficient and effective than means testing. <br><b> Prof John Veit-Wilson</b><br> University of Newcastle upon Tyne</p> <p>\u0095Polly Toynbee's endorsement of Gordon Brown's charity-case approach to pensioners is not acceptable. Mr Brown takes every opportunity to say that he does not believe in fudges and quick fixes, but this is all that pensioners are presented with. If we are a problem, it is essential that the resolution of the problem starts from the right position. The link to earnings is not just a bee in Barbara Castle's bonnet. Its (re-)acceptance would signal once and for all that our due place in society is acknowledged in terms of respect and the material dividend. <br><b> Bernard Hrusa-Marlow</b><br> Morden, Surrey</p>",

State pension contributions are compulsory, the pension one receives is not a handout that should eventually disappear except for the very poor (a view that has been floated by both major parties and is being implemented by stealth). The alleviation of the scandal of poverty among pensioners in Britain has to be addressed, but not by misappropriating the contributions of those who have an additional pension but are far from well off. David Andrews Glasgow andrews@oslo.fsnet.co.uk \u0095Polly Toynbee urges the government to introduce a minimum \u00a390 pension in April. This is the level the basic National Insurance pension would have reached if the link with earnings had been sustained. Moreover among couples in which the wife had a full contribution record (including up to 20 years looking after children) each would be getting \u00a390. However, the Minimum Income Guarantee only provides couples with 160% of MIG. Evidence from research on pensioners' income and expenditure by the Basic Income Group shows that apart from housing costs, an adequate income for couples is close to twice that of single pensioners. Many poorer pensioners receive housing benefit. I hope Polly Toynbee continues to urge the government to \"promise a \u00a3100 for every pensioner for 2002\" even if she does not accept that the best way to achieve this is by restoring the earnings' link for the basic state pension. Hilary Land School for Policy Studies, Bristol Hilary.Land@bristol.ac.uk \u0095Polly Toynbee misses the point. There are two principal ways to achieve a redistribution of income: progressive taxation and means testing. The problem is that while most people are in favour of a more equal society, both taxes and means testing tend to be unpopular. Despite this, the left have hitherto favoured the former and the right the latter. Restoring the pensions- earnings link need not redistribute from poor to rich, provided the rich are taxed more progressively. A more generous MIG may limit inequalities at the bottom of income distribution, while leaving them intact at the top. It is only because New Labour has foresworn the possibility of higher taxes on higher incomes that it must resort to means-tested assistance for the poorest. Prof Hartley Dean University of Luton hartley.dean@luton.ac.uk \u0095Polly Toynbee is wrong to claim that the minimum pension is no more charity than the state pension. The National Insurance pension is the right of every working person. The government claim that higher income pensioners do not \"need\" their NI pensions is nonsense. As for the MIG, all means-tested benefits which claimants experience as administrative discretion risk being felt as \"state charity\" and rejected by some eligible people. The government is incapable of solving this problem, and why should it? If it wants to be inclusive, it ought not to use means tests to solve the problems of poverty. If the government wants to deal with the problem of higher income pensioners having too much money because they contributed both to occupational as well as NI pension schemes, and may have other income creating assets, then they should tax more heavily at higher income levels. At the very least, they should increase the NI pensions to decency levels at the Family Budget Unit recommendations and \"clawback\" the increase from richer pensioners to arrive at the desired outcome that low total income pensioners get more benefits by right and higher ones get it but don't keep it. It is far more efficient and effective than means testing. Prof John Veit-Wilson University of Newcastle upon Tyne \u0095Polly Toynbee's endorsement of Gordon Brown's charity-case approach to pensioners is not acceptable. Mr Brown takes every opportunity to say that he does not believe in fudges and quick fixes, but this is all that pensioners are presented with. If we are a problem, it is essential that the resolution of the problem starts from the right position. The link to earnings is not just a bee in Barbara Castle's bonnet. Its (re-)acceptance would signal once and for all that our due place in society is acknowledged in terms of respect and the material dividend. Bernard Hrusa-Marlow Morden, Surrey",

      "body": "<p>The joint inquiry into train protection systems opened this week and began the process of trying to assess how financially worthwhile it is for rail operators to stop killing the public.</p> <p>The current cost benefit analyses used by the rail industry shows the value of a human life going up. Until last year, it was hovering around the \u00a32.7m mark, but it seems to have risen to \u00a35.5m. The government's education policies must be working, as the value added seems remarkable. It is good to know that we are worth so much more than we were. We must have turned round our IT skills no end. We are also better at cricket and the less athletic Olympic events such as Cluedo and bar billiards.</p> <p>Of course it is all based on perception, which means focus groups. Academics conduct surveys on what is called \"Willingness to Pay\". People are presented with questionnaires, with questions phrased in certain ways, tastefully of course. A professor doesn't ask people to make judgments about the attractiveness of people on trains, how worth living their lives are, how many are first class or how much they spend in the buffet. Well, I don't think he does anyway. I believe the general thrust of these surveys is to ascertain how much people are prepared to pay collectively for safe travel. What they are not told is that, until they collectively reclaim the railways from the privateers who took them, it is the shareholders and not the public who hold the purse strings anyway.</p> <p>Of course, much depends on one's concept of a lot of money: \u00a35.5m is a great deal of money, unless it is your annual bonus. These things are relative, so focus groups look at the different things money can be spent on.

      "bodyText": "The joint inquiry into train protection systems opened this week and began the process of trying to assess how financially worthwhile it is for rail operators to stop killing the public. The current cost benefit analyses used by the rail industry shows the value of a human life going up. Until last year, it was hovering around the \u00a32.7m mark, but it seems to have risen to \u00a35.5m. The government's education policies must be working, as the value added seems remarkable. It is good to know that we are worth so much more than we were. We must have turned round our IT skills no end. We are also better at cricket and the less athletic Olympic events such as Cluedo and bar billiards. Of course it is all based on perception, which means focus groups. Academics conduct surveys on what is called \"Willingness to Pay\". People are presented with questionnaires, with questions phrased in certain ways, tastefully of course. A professor doesn't ask people to make judgments about the attractiveness of people on trains, how worth living their lives are, how many are first class or how much they spend in the buffet. Well, I don't think he does anyway. I believe the general thrust of these surveys is to ascertain how much people are prepared to pay collectively for safe travel. What they are not told is that, until they collectively reclaim the railways from the privateers who took them, it is the shareholders and not the public who hold the purse strings anyway. Of course, much depends on one's concept of a lot of money: \u00a35.5m is a great deal of money, unless it is your annual bonus. These things are relative, so focus groups look at the different things money can be spent on. People are asked to compare the importance of rail safety to that of road safety, which immediately creates a false antithesis in the mind of the subject, as though somehow the victims and bereaved of Southall and Ladbroke Grove are advocating the scrapping of the speed limit and that traffic cops should be serving drinks on the hard shoulder.

      "body": "<p>What kind of business leadership is required in the era of e-commerce? Is it more of the same, or is a different style required to create and sustain companies that are flatter, faster and focused?</p> <p>Some of today's new economy organisations are growing at breathtaking speed and rely on responsiveness to individual customer needs. There are no clear precedents and little chance to refer to some higher authority for guidance.</p> <p>In start-up organisations motivation and emotional engagement are not the issue. People have sacrificed job security for high-risk ventures in the anticipation of big returns. And where the new business is the spin-off from a traditional organisation, they need to understand that the old ways of working will not lead to success.</p> <p>Already there is another category of organisation emerging: the post-boom dot.com, where initial enthusiasm and hype have given way to falling share prices and where retention of staff is emerging as an issue.</p> <p>Companies that survive will be those that recognise the need for effective leadership. In the past 100 years, leadership has changed. In the early part of the 20th century, the style was often paternalistic. Communication was top-down, with little opportunity for the grassroots to contribute. A clear distinction existed between \"them\" and \"us\": workers and management. Employees were told what to do and not valued as having a contribution to make to the business. It was unnecessary for them to understand their organisation's vision or values.</p> <p>Today's workforce is a totally different entity. People are expected, and want, to use their own initiative. Within dot.coms, decisions have to be made in a fast-moving environment without reference to anybody else. People are very often managing themselves. There simply isn't the time to wait for their line manager to provide direction. So they need a clear framework of criteria that should be applied to decisions they make.

      "bodyText": "What kind of business leadership is required in the era of e-commerce? Is it more of the same, or is a different style required to create and sustain companies that are flatter, faster and focused? Some of today's new economy organisations are growing at breathtaking speed and rely on responsiveness to individual customer needs. There are no clear precedents and little chance to refer to some higher authority for guidance. In start-up organisations motivation and emotional engagement are not the issue. People have sacrificed job security for high-risk ventures in the anticipation of big returns. And where the new business is the spin-off from a traditional organisation, they need to understand that the old ways of working will not lead to success. Already there is another category of organisation emerging: the post-boom dot.com, where initial enthusiasm and hype have given way to falling share prices and where retention of staff is emerging as an issue. Companies that survive will be those that recognise the need for effective leadership. In the past 100 years, leadership has changed. In the early part of the 20th century, the style was often paternalistic. Communication was top-down, with little opportunity for the grassroots to contribute. A clear distinction existed between \"them\" and \"us\": workers and management. Employees were told what to do and not valued as having a contribution to make to the business. It was unnecessary for them to understand their organisation's vision or values. Today's workforce is a totally different entity. People are expected, and want, to use their own initiative. Within dot.coms, decisions have to be made in a fast-moving environment without reference to anybody else. People are very often managing themselves. There simply isn't the time to wait for their line manager to provide direction. So they need a clear framework of criteria that should be applied to decisions they make. Good leaders will provide this. It's not enough to manage - they have to lead. In the last 30 years organisations that have been successful have leaders who recognise that their people are their single greatest asset. They have used effective communication to ensure that their people have a greater understanding of how the leader wants to grow the business, what the goals are, and how they can contribute to achieving them. Good leaders are those who provide vision, motivate their people, generate enthusiasm, celebrate success, provide a focus for the organisation and clarify future direction. These qualities are still important in today's e-commerce environment and one person has to provide them; it can't be shared. While leadership skills can be encouraged, leadership itself is not a team effort. Clear direction must come from the top. Companies such as Virgin with Richard Branson, Tesco with Terry Leahy, Southwest Airlines with Herb Kelleher, and BP Amoco with Sir John Browne are all excellent examples.

Terry Leahy, Tesco's CEO, when asked to prioritise press versus staff, chose staff as the more important audience. BP Amoco's Sir John Browne believes that their strongest asset is the quality of their people and discusses performance issues with all staff via the internet and email.

      "body": "<p>If you were to believe the hype of lurid posters promoting the next literary bestseller which cry out for attention at every Underground station platform and bus shelter, or newspaper stories shrieking about the massive advances for first novels from unknown authors, you would think that writing a book was a fast train to bonanza town.</p> <p>Even experts in the industry are bullish: Richard Beswick, editorial director at Little, Brown &amp; Co, a publishing house known for promoting first novels, would argue that writing talent is being snapped up. \"It is not very difficult to get published. If you are a good writer, if your novel has a good narrative with good characterisation and a good plot, you will be published.\"</p> <p>But the reality behind the glamour is that, although fulfilling in terms of creativity and self-expression, writing is rarely financially rewarding and can be a solitary lifestyle peppered with rejections.</p> <p>Literary agent Hannah Griffiths of Curtis Brown says that agents can go for eight months without hitting on a sample chapter suitable to show to a commissioning editor. Real spine-tinglers, books she thinks will change the reader's life and the shape of literary history, are even more rare. In her eight years as an agent she has found just three such manuscripts. At the time of this interview she had 17 novels on her desk waiting to be read.</p> <p>And even when a commission is bagged, the prizes are hardly glittering. A Society of Authors report published earlier this year showed that 50% of writers earn less than the minimum wage and just one in 10 earns a living from writing. The reality is made more painful by inaccurate reporting of mass advances: Magnus Mills, the bus driver allegedly paid a \u00a31m advance for his novel The Restraint of Beasts in fact received less than \u00a310,000.</p> <p>One essential detail is that the aspiring author will need to write him or herself into a second job, although this is not necessarily always negative: Philip Larkin and TS Eliot were salaried employees throughout their writing life. \"Dead-end jobs bring you into contact with lots of interesting characters who can inspire your writing,\" says Cathy Rosario, who has been writing novels for two and a half years and has yet to be published. She adds that while these jobs do not sap her emotional energy they are low-paid and so consume time.</p> <p>Most authors will tell you that finding an agent is as difficult as getting the green light from a publisher. Agents with well-known authors on their lists receive 10-20 synopses or full novels a week, while a smaller agent would expect to see between five and 10. This is a lot of reading.</p> <p>\"Writers often get a sense that they are being rejected out of hand, but often it is because they have not spent any time thinking about it. No one has time to read 400 pages a day, so your whole life becomes a decision of what to take home with you to read in the evening. And psychologically I am less inclined to start a 900-page manuscript.</p> <p>\"But if someone sends in a covering letter and a sample chapter of 10 pages I would have time to pick it up and read it in the 10 minutes before going into a meeting. It is much better to leave someone wanting more,\" says Ms Griffiths. She adds that letters should be addressed to specific agents - there are 13 at Curtis Brown - and not just the agency. The receptionist at an agency will advise authors which agent specialises in their genre.</p> <p>And agents have their own reputations with publishers to consider. If they push a novel which will not sell the pubisher will be less likely to trust their judgment. Agents are listed in The Writers and Artists Yearbook.</p> <p>If the work is accepted, advances vary wildly, but will usually be between \u00a35,000 and \u00a350,000. Royalties are traditionally 10% for a hardback and 7.5% for paperback - only if the work brings in more money than the advance - but this is changing as publishers face rising marketing costs.</p> <p>Not all writers employ an agent, who will typically take between 10-15% of any of the (usually) painfully small amount earned. Ms Rosario says: \"In some ways it gives you more freedom not to have an agent. If you have a very specific genre of writing then it may be better for you to research which publishers would be likely to be interested in that kind of fiction and write to them directly.\"</p> <p>Agents will, however, deal with foreign rights and possible film deals, and have a kind of collective bargaining power with publishers which an individual author will obviously not have. There have been some attempts to subvert the traditional power structure in book publishing to give more power to the writer.</p> <p>The Harry Potter series, famously, introduced the mass print-run for hardbacks. Citron Press, a collective founded in 1998 in an attempt to break the stranglehold of established publishers, took manuscripts which other mainstream publishers had rejected, published them in cheap editions and promoted them through its own book club, the internet and shops.</p> <p>It reversed the old idea of the advance; the author stumped up \u00a3400 when his or her manuscript was accepted to help cover costs. But in spite of support from well-known authors such as Sheridan Morley and John Mortimer, Citron Press went out of business last month for the simple reason that it could not sell enough copies.</p> <p>There are some internet publishing sites where writers can post samples of their work for the interest of publishers and agents. But this is in its early stages in the UK and Ms Griffiths says: \"Although I think it is a great idea, at the moment I just don't have time to log on to the net to look at sample chapters when I am already inundated with paper submissions. Also it would not be cost-effective for us to download all work which authors want to be considered.\"</p> <p>Getting poetry published does not involve the same hard slog - publishers keep a close eye on poetry magazines and competition winners tend to commission proactively rather than as a result of badgering - but nor does it involve much money. Christina Patterson, director of the Poetry Society, says that advances amount to no more than a few hundred pounds. Competitions are more lucrative, however.</p> <p>The Society's own National Poetry Competition, entry for which closes on October 31, has a top prize of \u00a35,000. As with most competitions, however, poets must pay to enter: Milton Keynes poet Kate Hunter says she would only bother to enter if she knew she was going to win. She has concentrated, instead, on getting published in specialist magazines, which include the Poetry Review and Ambit. Otherwise residencies and teaching opportunities pay reasonable rates, although work may be sporadic. For a six-month placement in a school or prison, the Poetry Society pays \u00a35,000 for a two-day week, only one of which must be spent at the institution - the other may be dedicated to writing.</p> <p>Although writing cannot really be learned, writing courses are useful. As Ms Rosario points out, you would expect a professional artist to have attended art college. Ms Griffiths says that courses, such as the MA in creative writing at the University of East Anglia, which has been taught in the past by literary luminaries such as Angela Carter, provide a filter - the assumption is that if you have been accepted on the course you must have some talent - and exposure to great mentors.</p> <p>Non-fiction publishing can sometimes be more lucrative. The biggest advance in literary history went to Jack Welch, CEO of General Electric in the United States, for his autobiography. He was paid more than $7m upfront, and although this was an exception, if you write the college textbook for a branch of chemistry or accountancy and it makes it in the States you can expect rewards in the tens or even hundreds of thousands of pounds.</p> <p>Mark Hammond, senior publishing editor at scientific, technical and medical publishers John Wiley, says that he will identify a gap in the market and approach a potential author himself, generally an academic or business person; rarely is it the other way round. Advances in non-fiction publishing are almost unknown and writers do it for the prestige and not the money.</p> <p>But then, one of the most positive elements to being a writer is that all experiences are valid. Not being sucessful in commercial terms gives you the breathing space to create your own narrative voice. \"In some ways it would be wonderful to have been published and paid a big advance, but in other ways that puts a lot of pressure on you to come up with the goods on time. Not having the confidence of being published has allowed me to develop a self-confidence in what I write which is not subject to the vagaries of editor or agent,\" says Ms Rosario.</p> <p>\u0095 The Poetry Society: 020-7420-989 5</p> <p><b>Tax and the writer</b></p> <p>If you regularly write or gather material to write, you are classed and taxed as a professional.

      "body": "<p>When demand for property is high even sane people can be overcome by feelings of panic at the thought of not being able to secure their desired home. The most lacklustre properties will sell quickly; estate agents hardly need to lift a finger.</p> <p>But when the froth has come off the market, agents and developers need to work harder to attract the attention of potential buyers.</p> <p>This week a group of house hunters boarded a helicopter to be flown over the countryside around Beaconsfield in Buckinghamshire and gaze down on the site of a future development by Nicholas King homes.</p> <p>Managing director Nicholas King says the company is targeting a specific group for an eight-home development called Curvare. \"We are selling houses to people who are expecting to pay between \u00a31m and \u00a31.6m. These are likely to be highly successful individuals working for themselves or in companies. What they haven't got is time,\" Mr King explains.</p> <p>\"We thought the sensible thing would be to bring them to see the site in a helicopter - something people still find exciting. We see our eight houses as special and exclusive and wanted to treat people in such a way as to say we really value you and your custom.\"</p> <p>Of course, the houses aren't there yet. The show home will be completed in January, so the ride was to whet buyers' appetites. The developer has only offered helicopter flights to people interested in the luxury home end of the market who were already registered with the two estate agents employed to market the properties.</p> <p>Accountant Meyrick Vevers was among those who flew from Battersea to Curvare. He says the ride was more than just a bit of fun. \"When you are on a building site it's quite hard to imagine what the development will look like when it's finished. Seeing the site from the air puts it in context.\"</p> <p>When it came to launching a new-build apartment block into a lukewarm market, developer Saxon Homes opted for shock tactics. Estate agents FPD Savills joined forces with ad company ADC Blueprint and dreamed up a campaign that took property advertising in a whole new direction. Such was the impact of the series of ads for the Artilleries apartments in Westminster (pictured below) that one was even banned - of which more later.</p> <p>\"The first phase of the development, Artillery mansions, was on the market for some time. We thought a different image was needed for the next phase of one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments,\" says Edward Lewis of FPD Savills in Sloane Street.</p> <p>However, like the Curvare development, completion was a long way off - in this case two years away. \"One of the problems agents have is how to get across a product that hasn't been built. If you are selling off plan you have to work a little bit harder.\"</p> <p>These days developers sell much more than bricks and mortar.

      "bodyText": "When demand for property is high even sane people can be overcome by feelings of panic at the thought of not being able to secure their desired home. The most lacklustre properties will sell quickly; estate agents hardly need to lift a finger. But when the froth has come off the market, agents and developers need to work harder to attract the attention of potential buyers. This week a group of house hunters boarded a helicopter to be flown over the countryside around Beaconsfield in Buckinghamshire and gaze down on the site of a future development by Nicholas King homes. Managing director Nicholas King says the company is targeting a specific group for an eight-home development called Curvare. \"We are selling houses to people who are expecting to pay between \u00a31m and \u00a31.6m. These are likely to be highly successful individuals working for themselves or in companies. What they haven't got is time,\" Mr King explains. \"We thought the sensible thing would be to bring them to see the site in a helicopter - something people still find exciting. We see our eight houses as special and exclusive and wanted to treat people in such a way as to say we really value you and your custom.\" Of course, the houses aren't there yet. The show home will be completed in January, so the ride was to whet buyers' appetites. The developer has only offered helicopter flights to people interested in the luxury home end of the market who were already registered with the two estate agents employed to market the properties. Accountant Meyrick Vevers was among those who flew from Battersea to Curvare. He says the ride was more than just a bit of fun. \"When you are on a building site it's quite hard to imagine what the development will look like when it's finished. Seeing the site from the air puts it in context.\" When it came to launching a new-build apartment block into a lukewarm market, developer Saxon Homes opted for shock tactics. Estate agents FPD Savills joined forces with ad company ADC Blueprint and dreamed up a campaign that took property advertising in a whole new direction. Such was the impact of the series of ads for the Artilleries apartments in Westminster (pictured below) that one was even banned - of which more later. \"The first phase of the development, Artillery mansions, was on the market for some time. We thought a different image was needed for the next phase of one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments,\" says Edward Lewis of FPD Savills in Sloane Street. However, like the Curvare development, completion was a long way off - in this case two years away. \"One of the problems agents have is how to get across a product that hasn't been built. If you are selling off plan you have to work a little bit harder.\" These days developers sell much more than bricks and mortar. Show homes are dressed up to the nines and house-hunters are invited to sign up for a lifestyle along with their en-suite and shiny cooker. And when it comes to lifestyles, who wouldn't want to be associated with the glamorous world of the supermodels - so Jodie Kidd and an LA-based fashion photographer were signed up to promote the Artilleries apartments. \"The development is priced realistically (from \u00a3245,000 to \u00a31,450,000) and in a good location. It had a lot going for it we just needed to bring it to people's attention,\" says Peter Morley, managing director of the advertising firm. \"We took eight or nine different sales points about the development and decided upon a radical photograph to go with each one,\" he adds. The result - Ms Kidd clutching a saddle and bridle looming over a man on all fours - is accompanied by the caption, \"great transport\" and for stunning balconies the supermodel is showing off her cleavage.

When the company tried to place an ad in the brochure for the Wimbledon tennis championships, the cautious people at the All England club declined in case the Duchess of Kent was embarrassed. Estate agents Hamptons takes a more subtle approach to targeting potential clients - through catching them at play. The company sponsors equestrian events and staff are often to be found assembling a stand showing all the homes with stables the agents have on the market. New approaches to selling property may be catching the public's eye or winning ad agencies awards (the Jodie Kidd campaign is in the running for a property award) but when it comes to payback time, does expensive marketing result in sales? Mr Vevers says the helicopter ride made him and his wife take seriously a site they would otherwise have overlooked. For Artilleries, the ads have been a great success, says Mr Lewis. \"We sold 81 units since the launch on June 8th.

      "bodyText": "United Nations officials in Kosovo were hastily putting together a team of election \"witnesses\" yesterday to count the voters who turn out for Sunday's crucial Yugoslav presidential and parliamentary elections. The UN has denounced the elections as neither free nor fair, and said previously that it would do no more than provide security for Serbs in Kosovo who wanted to vote - it is assumed that Albanian Kosovans will boycott the poll. It has changed its mind under heavy pressure from the US, Britain and other Nato countries which want to reduce President Slobodan Milosevic's chance of rigging the ballot. As it became clear that, in the absence of supervision, Mr Milosevic could use the Kosovan votes to bump up his total, the UN decided to appoint monitors. In Serbia itself no monitors, local or from Nato countries, have been accredited. Only the political parties will be able to have someone in the polling stations, but with restricted rights to examine the count and the lists of total votes. Anxious not to give credibility to the poll, the UN team in Kosovo will stay out of the election buildings and count voters, not votes, to have some check on turnout padding. Officials say they are operating on opinion poll predictions that Mr Milosevic needs 500,000 extra votes to secure the 50% required for a first-round win. The head of the UN administration, Bernard Kouchner, is expected to announce the number seen entering and leaving polling stations late on Sunday evening. The UN acted as Western officials stepped up their warning of fraud on Sunday. In Zagreb the European Union external relations commissioner, Chris Patten, said Mr Milosevic might use \"Stalinist\" methods to keep power after the election. \"While many of us believe that the overwhelming majority in Serbia want the long night represented by Milosevic's regime to come to an end, I am not sure that is a view entirely held by Mr Milosevic,\" he told reporters after talks with Croatian officials. \"If Milosevic hangs on, I think many people predict growing economic and humanitarian problems in Serbia. That is one reason why we want to see ... substantial and rapid change as soon as possible,\" he added. The Nato secretary-general, Lord Robertson, said he hoped Yugoslav opposition parties would win by too large a margin for Mr Milosevic to falsify the result. \"I hope the people of Serbia use the opportunity they have to accept the welcome Europe extends to them if they turn their backs on the politics of ethnic hatred.

      "bodyText": "Plaid Cymru should set its sights high and aim to take over from Labour as the main political force in Wales, the party's annual conference was told yesterday. In his first conference speech as president, Ieuan Wyn Jones, said Plaid was facing the greatest challenge in its history, that of winning the trust of the Welsh people to govern the country following the 2003 assembly elections. New Labour's shift to the right, he told the party faithful in Llandudno, was leaving Wales with \"an enormous political vacuum\". But it was not enough to expect people to vote for Plaid because they were disillusioned with the present administration. Plaid's aim was to form a government that would have the will to bring about \"real change\" in Wales. It was not seeking the chance to govern as an aim in itself and would have to prove to the Welsh electorate that it was worthy of its trust. \"This will mean a different approach to our politics,\" he warned. \"Calling on Labour to do this and that will no longer be enough. We will have to show what Plaid Cymru would do in government. It means not to promise more than we will be able to deliver.\" Mr Jones said the coming general election would be of \"utmost importance\" for Wales which needed a voice in Westminster pushing the cause of securing law-making powers for the assembly. The party had to make sure that that objective of securing parity with Scotland would become one of the major issues in the election campaign. Mr Jones said the assembly's lack of powers were becoming increasingly apparent and were preventing it from creating the conditions needed to improve the lives of the people of Wales. \"We are all agreed that the priority for us now is for Wales to gain the same powers as Scotland,\" he said. \"The national assembly must grow into a real parliament that can get things done, and this must happen soon. We will continue to languish as a country if we continue to let ourselves be treated as a second class nation.\" Accusing Downing Street of pursuing policies that were leading to a \"grotesque disparity\" between the richer and poorer parts of Britain, he said Plaid's manifesto would set out demands for a radical change in fiscal and economic policy. At the heart of its demand would be the use of fiscal policy to fund investment and economic development in areas of disadvantage such as Wales. Such an approach would allow a reduction in interest rates, and a lowering of the pound against the euro, enabling Wales's manufacturers, its steel industry and farmers to compete on a level playing field. Mr Jones said that it was a disgrace that Wales, birthplace of the NHS, had one of the worst health records in Europe. \"Somebody must be honest enough to say that only through a substantial increase in public spending can we achieve a better health service, better education and better public transport.\" With the party about to embark on a major consultation on its long-term constitutional objectives Mr Jones insisted that Plaid made no secret of its high ambitions for Wales in an increasingly interdependent world. \"We see our aspiration of full national status within the EU in the context of the far-reaching changes that are taking place in Britain, Europe and the world. \"We want Wales to have as much control over her affairs as is possible and necessary to determine her own destiny.\" \u0095 The conference will today condemn plans for the 2001 national census as flawed and unresponsive to the needs of devolution because people in Wales will not be given the opportunity to describe themselves as Welsh.",

      "bodyText": "The CIA and the former head of the Chilean secret police are scrambling to blame each other for a series of murders at home and abroad, including a notorious 1976 car bombing in Washington. In the rush to implicate one another, both sides are divulging an unprecedented number of previously secret internal documents, to the elation of historians and survivors of the Chilean military regime that ruled from 1973 to 1990. The latest round of revelations began early this week when the CIA submitted a report to the US Congress that included secret papers from the early 1970s. These documents gave details of extensive bribery of Chilean politicians, efforts to \"disorganise\" the Chilean Socialist party and a $35,000 payment to Chilean military officials said to be involved in the murder of General Rene Schneider, who opposed US plans to overthrow the government of Salvador Allende in Chile at its birth in 1970. For Chileans, the most explosive item was evidence that the head of the secret police under the military regime, Manuel Contreras - a senior adviser to the regime's leader, Augusto Pinochet - was a double agent and briefly on the CIA's payroll. Mr Contreras immediately denied the CIA accusations. They were in retaliation, he maintained, for his action in passing a stack of secret documents to US investigators in April. \"The FBI is working to establish the truth [about CIA collaboration with Pinochet's secret police]... The CIA is quite worried that the judicial investigation will reach them,\" Mr Contreras said in an interview from his jail cell at Punta Peuco, a prison for military officials convicted of human rights violations during the military regime. Counter-attacking, Mr Contreras gave details of an alleged proposal by the then deputy director general of the CIA, Vernon Walters, to secure the help of five US senators in improving Chile's tarnished image under the dictatorship, in exchange for $2m a year. Mr Contreras also alleged that General Pinochet ordered him to ask the CIA to help organise the repressive secret police known as the Dina. \"He told me that we needed their help because in reality we had never had a national intelligence operation,\" Mr Contreras said in a radio interview with CNN's Spanish language service. The CIA was actually too keen, he maintained. Referring to eight CIA agents who allegedly arrived in August 1974, Mr Contreras said: \"They wanted to remain in Chile, in charge of the principal Dina posts, something that I didn't accept under instructions from the president.\" The revelations - termed \"worrisome and surprising\" by the Chilean foreign minister, Soledad Alvear - are expected to stimulate congressional investigations in both countries and may also fuel court cases. Historians and civil rights groups pounced on the allegations for use in piecing together the role of each spy agency in the deaths of prominent democracy activists. The revelations have broken a CIA \"wall of silence\" on how the US supported the repressive Pinochet apparatus, said Peter Kornbluh, a Washington writer and historian who has long pressed for disclosure. Those whose murders are linked to the dictatorship include the Chilean diplomat Orlando Letelier. Just blocks from the White House, the former defence minister, 44, was killed by a car bomb 24 years ago. His US assistant Ronni Moffitt, 24, died with him. Widely considered to be the most brazen act of international terrorism committed in the US capital, the Letelier bombing remains a study in cold war politics. While top Pinochet aides and anti-Castro Cuban terrorists have been convicted for the bombing, evidence directly linking Pinochet has yet to emerge. But the flood of new information could force the United States to invigorate a long- dormant justice department extradition request for Gen Pinochet, if investigators believe they have grounds implicating him. \"There has been a positive attitude [from Washington] to provide information to clear up the truth,\" said Fabiola Letelier, the slain diplomat's sister. \"Don't forget that Janet Reno [the current US attorney general] supported the declassification\" of documents that began with the 1998 judicial process against Gen Pinochet in Spain, she added. In the two years since the arrest of Gen Pinochet in a London clinic after Spain sought - unsuccessfully - to extradite him to face charges of abuses committed under his regime, US officials have seen their cold war actions exposed to new examination. This has covered not only the extensive clandestine support given to the Chilean dictatorship in the 1970s, but also, more recently, Washington's actions with the professed aim of protecting human rights in Latin America. Gen Pinochet, 84, is unlikely ever to be extradited to the US, but a formal request would be the ultimate indignity for him at his former allies' hands, and another CIA embarrassment.",

On a more positive note, the planned merger between Henlys' British operations and Mayflower's UK and Asian bus and coach venture is on course. The venture, to be 30% owned by Henlys and called Transbus International, would create Europe's fourth biggest player with revenues of around \u00a3460m.",

      "body": "<p>Vittorio Radice is too cool to be photographed wearing a tie, even if it is Helmut Lang. The suave chief executive of Selfridges is busy casting off the offending item, worn only for the City analysts to whom he has just made his twice-yearly presentation, as he strides elegantly through the London store into which he has injected his Italian style. </p> <p>In his perfectly cut, black designer suit, the affable Radice has convinced the pin-striped brigade that the \u00a3100m face lift of the frumpy store has been worthwhile. In stark contrast to his Oxford Street neighbour, Marks &amp; Spencer, sales are soaring and profits rising thanks to the purchasing power of the 17m shoppers who stream through the doors each year. Selfridges, shrouded in a vast hoarding while its brickwork is cleaned, is hip and trendy. </p> <p>The charismatic 43-year-old, after bumping into a trio of chic Italian women friends in the bustling store, is explaining that his strategy is of a \"house of brands\", be they Armani, Prada and Gucci or Kookai and French Connection. The Selfridges label is only to be found on chocolate bars, tea and marmalade, his reluctant concession to the tourists who have started flocking to the five-storey old lady of Oxford Street. \"I believe this very strongly,\" he says in his accented English. \"There are thousands of very talented people out there designing and producing clothing. If the world is in need of a jumper, it's definitely not in need of a Selfridges jumper.\" </p> <p>This is from a man who studied farming at university, his way of rebelling against a family which had retailing in the veins. The shopkeepers' instinct was nevertheless too strong to resist. \"You discover, very soon, even if you want to be a farmer, your legacy, your roots are very different,\" he says. \"I made my mistake. I did try to rebel. I didn't succeed\". </p> <p>He made more of a success, though, of retailing, the career route also chosen by his father who had two furniture stores near Milan. After his compulsory military service and short stint working in Libya, Radice joined Associated Merchandising Corporation as buyer before joining Habitat 10 years ago, moving his young family from Italy to Britain, and becoming responsible for Habitat's new image. </p> <p>As he rubs strong-smelling Sui Dreams cream by designer Anna Sui into his hands, sampled at one of the concessions in the vast beauty hall, Radice says he knew that Selfridges would be a challenge. But that was what made the role attractive in 1996 when he joined the store, then part of the Sears group. </p> <p>With Radice at the helm, Selfridges was spun off from the now-defunct Sears in July 1998 when it made a stock market debut greeted with scepticism. </p> <p>\"The name 'department store' needs change. It does not give justice. We came out of the departments, out of the skirt department, the coat department, the trouser department, a long time ago,\" he says. \"We now have areas dedicated to Kookai, to olive oil . . . to fresh meat. I don't call it the fresh meat department. We are a brands store.\" </p> <p>What this means is that Selfridges decides which brands to bring into the store and leaves the actual design of the product, its manufacturing and its marketing, to the brand itself, more akin to a shopping centre. In all, 45% of the 2,800 brands in the store are run as concessions, not that the customer would ever know. </p> <p>\"To the customer eye there is no difference. There is one receipt, one dialogue, one service, one packaging. There's one environment. There's one door. It's called Selfridges,\" Radice says. </p> <p><strong> Destination store</strong><br> </p> <p> His ambition is to open up his doors in cities across the country. The first foray outside Oxford Street, where Selfridges opened for business in 1909, was in Manchester. Birmingham will be next, with Glasgow, Leeds, Newcastle, Bristol and possibly Cardiff coming soon. </p> <p>At the same time, Radice has ambitious plans for the Oxford Street store, which he wants to be listed in every guide to London. He has plans for a tower, housing a cinema or a gym, and, in an attempt to deter criticism that the multi-million pound contract will be awarded preferentially to his 12% shareholder British Land, Radice has set up a committee to choose the successful bidder. </p> <p>The hotel next door to the store on Oxford Street, which also includes a petrol station, is to be smartened up. It is all part of his plan to make Selfridges a \"destination for entertainment\". </p> <p>\"Shopping is entertainment. There is nothing else. Even when you buy toilet paper you choose the pink one versus the yellow one. Why choose the yellow verses the blue one? You want pleasure,\" he says. </p> <p>Plans to open across the country have led to concerns that the focus will be taken off the Oxford Street store and extend Selfridges into regions where spending power is not as great. Not so, says Radice, who admits he shared some of the anxieties when opening the Manchester store in the Trafford Centre on the outskirts. </p> <p>\"Three years down the line all the questions have been answered. In Manchester they are much more brand aware,\" he says, confident that the same is true of the other cities on his expansion screen. Manchester contributed \u00a3700,000 of the company's \u00a312m of pre-tax profits in the first six months of this year. </p> <p>Radice does not rule venturing outside these shores once the domestic expansion is in full swing. But, instead of using the Selfridges name, he envisages revamping old department stores in European capitals in the way he has in London. </p> <p>The logic behind the expansion is that it gives Radice more bargaining power in deals with designers. If their product is not selling in one store, it can be moved to another. Greater size might help Selfridges win more exclusive selling arrangements, such as those for a new perfume by DKNY and for SK II, the anti-ageing cosmetic brand designed by a Japanese monk and based on sake, the rice wine. </p> <p>While he dislikes comparisons with other stores, the City has regarded Selfridges' revamp as taking it towards Harvey Nichols and Harrods, both of which are located in Knightsbridge rather than Oxford Street, which is nevertheless now looking smarter than it once did. He will admit that if either of these two rivals have something he would like in Selfridges, it is the Fifth Floor at Harvey Nichols, the bar and restaurant area where ladies lunch. </p> <p>Selfridges does not have an entrance which lends itself to a restaurant opening after shop hours but Radice intends to try out a post-midnight bar in a new basement music centre next year. </p> <p><strong> 'Strong message'</strong><br> </p> <p> Radice believes he has stemmed the concern that he would alienate the traditional Selfridges shopper by being too radical. Selfridges has something for everyone, he says, but still has a focus. \"Once you are secure about what you want to deliver, the message is so strong that you automatically attract and push people away,\" he says. </p> <p>So, the ground floor, with Kookai next to Miss Selfridge, Ted Baker and Oasis pulls in the \"young teenagers, off school at 4.30 and straight in to buy their Saturday night gear. Wonderful.\" </p> <p>On the fourth floor, the bath towels and kimonos attract another type of shopper, while the second floor, with its expensive designer ranges, appeals to others. </p> <p>Of the radical and often painful changes that have been made at Selfridges, he believes he may have benefited from being away from his native country. \"It is difficult to formulate, but in a way, the fact you are a foreigner you are much more willing to take risks,\" he says. </p> <p>Describing himself as a tourist, though he, his wife and two Arsenal supporting sons have lived in London for 10 years, Radice could bolster his income substantially if Selfridges sustains its improvements. He stands to gain shares worth six times his six-figure salary if it reaches certain targets seven years after the flotation. </p> <p>Claiming he could run Selfridges \"forever\", he says: \"We've got 4,000 people here. They've got more ideas than I can cope with. It's all coming together. Everybody's career here is being enhanced by the fact they are part of this story. I feel very good, being part of this regeneration of Selfridges.\"</p>",

Not so, says Radice, who admits he shared some of the anxieties when opening the Manchester store in the Trafford Centre on the outskirts. \"Three years down the line all the questions have been answered. In Manchester they are much more brand aware,\" he says, confident that the same is true of the other cities on his expansion screen. Manchester contributed \u00a3700,000 of the company's \u00a312m of pre-tax profits in the first six months of this year. Radice does not rule venturing outside these shores once the domestic expansion is in full swing. But, instead of using the Selfridges name, he envisages revamping old department stores in European capitals in the way he has in London. The logic behind the expansion is that it gives Radice more bargaining power in deals with designers. If their product is not selling in one store, it can be moved to another. Greater size might help Selfridges win more exclusive selling arrangements, such as those for a new perfume by DKNY and for SK II, the anti-ageing cosmetic brand designed by a Japanese monk and based on sake, the rice wine. While he dislikes comparisons with other stores, the City has regarded Selfridges' revamp as taking it towards Harvey Nichols and Harrods, both of which are located in Knightsbridge rather than Oxford Street, which is nevertheless now looking smarter than it once did. He will admit that if either of these two rivals have something he would like in Selfridges, it is the Fifth Floor at Harvey Nichols, the bar and restaurant area where ladies lunch. Selfridges does not have an entrance which lends itself to a restaurant opening after shop hours but Radice intends to try out a post-midnight bar in a new basement music centre next year. 'Strong message' Radice believes he has stemmed the concern that he would alienate the traditional Selfridges shopper by being too radical. Selfridges has something for everyone, he says, but still has a focus. \"Once you are secure about what you want to deliver, the message is so strong that you automatically attract and push people away,\" he says. So, the ground floor, with Kookai next to Miss Selfridge, Ted Baker and Oasis pulls in the \"young teenagers, off school at 4.30 and straight in to buy their Saturday night gear. Wonderful.\" On the fourth floor, the bath towels and kimonos attract another type of shopper, while the second floor, with its expensive designer ranges, appeals to others. Of the radical and often painful changes that have been made at Selfridges, he believes he may have benefited from being away from his native country. \"It is difficult to formulate, but in a way, the fact you are a foreigner you are much more willing to take risks,\" he says. Describing himself as a tourist, though he, his wife and two Arsenal supporting sons have lived in London for 10 years, Radice could bolster his income substantially if Selfridges sustains its improvements. He stands to gain shares worth six times his six-figure salary if it reaches certain targets seven years after the flotation. Claiming he could run Selfridges \"forever\", he says: \"We've got 4,000 people here. They've got more ideas than I can cope with. It's all coming together. Everybody's career here is being enhanced by the fact they are part of this story. I feel very good, being part of this regeneration of Selfridges.\"",

With the old town cemetery full, Mr Bernardi was outraged this summer by the ruling of a court in Nice that his plan for a new one on an attractive seaside site planted with olive trees contravened planning regulations. Acting on a complaint by a local environmental group, the court decided that the site he proposed fell within the scope of strict recent regulations governing what may and may not be built in coastal areas of outstanding natural beauty. The law, which forbids \"heavy and permanent\" construction along the much-abused Mediterranean coast of France, has been invoked by several local councils to outlaw unsightly beach bars and restaurants from Corsica to Saint-Tropez. But in this case, Mr Bernardi said, the court's decision was \"an abusive interpretation of the regulations\". Nearly a third of Le Lavandou's 5,500 residents are over 65, he pointed out, and 80 people die in the town each year: 19 await permanent resting places, housed temporarily in friend's burial vaults. The mayor rejected the alternative site proposed by the environmentalists: a disused quarry just outside town. \"We can't bury bodies in a dump,\" he said. \"This is an important issue concerning religious faith and respect of the dead.\" He admitted that the bylaw was something of a publicity stunt. \"It's an absurd law to counter an absurd situation.

Jon Henley, Paris Execution is no restraint on killers A new US study has found that murder rates are significantly lower in states that have refused to reintroduce the death penalty than in those -such as Texas, Mississippi and Louisiana - which have restored it since 1976. In 10 of the 12 states that do not have capital punishment, according a New York Times study, the homicide rate is below the national average, while in death-penalty states killings are routinely 50% to 100% more common than in those without executions. \"It's clear that the states with the death penalty may want it more because they have more homicides,\" Alfred Blumstein of the National Consortium on Violence Research commented. \"But it's not clear that it does them any good in terms of reducing homicide.\" Of the five states with the lowest rates, three are non-capital punishment states: North Dakota, Iowa and Massachusetts.

A lot of these countries spend all their time paying back their debts. \"I don t plan to get involved in any violent demonstrations, but I will be there on Tuesday when thousands of us will march through the city and surround the congress centre. Its fantastically symbolic - we ll keep them in our grip just like they keep the third world in their grip, and we won t let go until they surrender and agree to disband the organisations.\" \u0095 Interview by Kate Connolly",

      "bodyText": "Multibillion pound programmes to revive inner cities and create work in depressed regions and coalfield communities face being vetoed by Brussels because they breach EU rules on state aid. Anxious Labour MPs have joined builders and developers to warn that thousands of jobs are at risk with a cloud hanging over hundreds of urban regeneration and job creation initiatives. In a hard hitting report, the Commons environment committee has warned that meddling by Brussels will have \"severe consequences\" for the deputy prime minister John Prescott's vision of an urban renaissance, which is tied to the regeneration of brownfield sites. Mr Prescott has set a target of building 60% of new homes on such sites. Fuelling the debate about Britain's relationship with the EU, the environment committee says that \"illogical and ill-considered\" rulings from Brussels are bringing the EU into disrepute. It warns that planned jobs, and other benefits, might no longer be delivered to deprived communities. \"Areas already suffering from urban decay may enter a spiral of decline as the cancer spreads, making it even more difficult for future regeneration efforts to succeed,\" it said. At the heart of the dispute is the partnership investment programme, overseen by Mr Prescott's Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions. It provides grants for developers to kick-start urban regeneration schemes, from converting old warehouses into flats to clearing derelict and contaminated sites for new homes and workshops. The EU says the programme constitutes state aid and should be vetoed. The Housebuilders' Federation said \u00a3700m of grants had encouraged developers to spend \u00a31.4bn on new projects. This had led to the rebirth of city centres, from Manchester and Leeds to Newcastle and Sheffield, with thousands of people moving into new homes. Last year around 3,000 acres were cleaned up and 7,500 new houses and flats provided in cities. Although Brussels says that schemes in the pipeline can be completed, the Housebuilders Federation warned yesterday that the EU stance is likely to have a \"devastating\" impact on Mr Prescott's target for brownfield building. \"This is a terrible blow because housebuilders are close to hitting the target and without gap funding [grants] they will have to turn down the opportunity of redeveloping many of these areas because they cannot be expected to work at a loss,\" it said. \"City centres have been transformed and now all of this is at risk because of an annoying and frankly silly ruling.\" Problems have been compounded on two other fronts. This week the regeneration magazine, New Start, revealed that a \u00a315m fund to revive former pit villages has been frozen and may be outlawed under EU rules. Launched in 1998, the coalfield enterprise fund was hailed as a sign of the government's commitment to rebuilding coalfield communities, devastated by pit closures in the early 1990s. But the European Commission now says the scheme is being examined to see if it, too, complies with EU state aid rules. For two years, agencies have been given no explanation as to why they cannot tap into the fund. \"Although this money was promised in 1998, nothing has been drawn from it,\" said Dave Perry of the Coalfield Communities Campaign. Brussels has also frozen the Department of Trade and Industry's \u00a3150m regional venture capital fund, designed to encourage new businesses and entrepreneurs in depressed areas. The Department of the Environment said it was extremely concerned by the commission's rulings. \"We were disappointed when they ruled that the partnership investment programme breached state aid rules because we explained that this did not constitute state aid as such.\" Alternative measures to assist cities, coalfield communities and new businesses were being considered, it said.",

They are also, in constructing the first artificial surf reef on the continent, stirring controversy during what is seen as a renaissance in surfing.

The aim is to recreate a surfing spot that was lost when Chevron oil built a jetty in 1984 to protect the pipeline from its rigs to its refinery.

Chevron has agreed to pay around $300,000 (\u00a3210,000) for the construction of what will be known as Pratte's Reef. Work should be completed by the end of next week. The project has raised a debate among surfers as to whether man should interfere with nature to such an extent. Some traditionalists say that part of the joy of surfing is its natural, unpredictable nature and building a reef runs counter to that. But Mr Evans believes that the foundation is doing the right thing. He likens the scheme to the reclaiming of wetlands as an environmentally healthy exercise in that what had once existed was being respectfully replaced. The foundation will monitor the effect the construction has on natural marine habitats and if damage is being done it will remove the new reef. Mr Evans said there were two artificial reefs in Australia, but such a construction had never been attempted before in the US which, with an estimated 2m participants, has the largest surfing community in the world. The new reef is being built at a time of renewed enthusiasm for the sport, not least with the arrival of more women surfers, many of whom had complained in the past of being made to feel unwelcome in a very male environment. \"There is a renaissance for surfing,\" Mr Evans said, \"and more women are joining every day.\" He said that women now made up around 30% of the Surfriders' membership of 26,000. The internet has also changed the face of surfing. In the old days, surfers used their instincts and knowledge of the seas and weather to choose where to go and when. Now it is possible to get a surf report on the internet which accounts for the pre-dawn arrival of the wet-suited surfing fraternity on some top beaches, like Rincon Point south of Santa Barbara and Malibu. Surfline.com claims to have 375,000 users of its information on waves which is gathered from tidal information, buoy readings and satellite wave height maps. Some free-spirited traditions are being maintained, however, including the surfing community's avoidance of the Olympic Games despite attempts to include the sport as an exhibition event in Sydney. In the latest Surfer magazine, Gina Makin spells out good reasons for non-participation. \"During the opening and closing ceremonies, all Olympic athletes must march and we all know that surfers should never - will never - march.\" It was nearly 40 years ago that the Beach Boys and Surfin' USA introduced the rest of the world to the names of the legendary surfing beaches of California - from Manhattan Beach and Pacific Palisades up to the Ventura County Line.

There a false leg was for sale with a brown plastic moccasin still laced onto the foot. There were second-hand toilet seats, and half-empty jars of moisturising cream for sale.</p> <p>The dentist was looking for clothes for her relatives, also refugees.

He will crush us\", says a 40-year-old mother of two. \"I will be on the streets on Sunday night. He has stolen ten years of my life\".</p> <p>But mostly the women are trying to ignore the election; escaping into Snezana's warm salon with its tinted coffee-coloured glass.</p> <p>There they chain-smoke and wait their turn. They favour the henna hair colour of eastern Europe of the early 80s - even their hair colours are trapped in a time warp.</p> <p>They will go out and vote on Sunday but nobody is confident there will be change.</p> <p>Those that aren't standing by their man, President Slobodan Milosevic, are pretending this election is not happening - or they are trembling.</p>",

On Monday, opposition stickers that read: \"He's finished\" appeared on the lift doors on each of the 15 floors and above all the shop doors in the basement. By yesterday they had been covered over with posters of the smiling president. Underneath was written \"For Yugoslavia\" in stern white letters. For the last month, Belgrade's food shortages have eased, with the shops receiving oil and sugar twice a day. \"That will stop after the election,\" says Mira. At the back of the building, near the towers of the electricity plant, a retired dentist of 59 is rummaging through the \"market\" that the local people call \"Bangladesh\". It's a place where the poorest of almost 1m Serbs driven from their homes during the Croatian and Bosnian wars survive by selling what they find in other people's bins. Yesterday, a slow, steady autumn rain soaked mud into the sodden carpets that make up their stall tables. There a false leg was for sale with a brown plastic moccasin still laced onto the foot. There were second-hand toilet seats, and half-empty jars of moisturising cream for sale. The dentist was looking for clothes for her relatives, also refugees. She is voting for the opposition and despite fears that next week could bring violent confrontation between the people and the police, she says: \"I can't wait.\" In the afternoon the Milosevic-supporting women who have come for their wash and set are replaced by the younger generation: working women who finish at three. \"I am frightened that he will choke us. He will crush us\", says a 40-year-old mother of two. \"I will be on the streets on Sunday night. He has stolen ten years of my life\". But mostly the women are trying to ignore the election; escaping into Snezana's warm salon with its tinted coffee-coloured glass. There they chain-smoke and wait their turn. They favour the henna hair colour of eastern Europe of the early 80s - even their hair colours are trapped in a time warp. They will go out and vote on Sunday but nobody is confident there will be change. Those that aren't standing by their man, President Slobodan Milosevic, are pretending this election is not happening - or they are trembling.",

But with more than 1,000 people arriving at architect Peter St John's Islington home tomorrow, the social niceties will have to be ditched. The masses will descend on Mr St John as part of London Open House, when a vast and fascinating range of the capital's finest buildings throw their doors open to the public. The annual celebration of architecture features both grand public offices and headquarters such as the Foreign Office and the Channel 4 building, and an extensive contingent of private homes such as Mr St John's. The architect, of Caruso St John, designers of the Walsall Art Gallery, first invited the public to come and admire his decor two years ago. \"It is a kind of mad and slightly narcissistic thing to do,\" he admitted. \"Deep down all architects have a deep need for people to look at and be interested in their work.\" While he hoped it would encourage public appreciation of the \"built environment\", Mr St John conceded that it also appealed to \"a natural fascination with what other people's houses are like\". With 40 people coming in every 15 minutes, it was exhausting but also a lot of fun, especially for his children who did a roaring trade selling biscuits. As there is little of value to steal, he was not overly concerned about potential burglars. \"We have a few friends standing around trying to make sure nothing disappears, but people were generally very well behaved.\" Several other architects, including Nicholas Burwell, David Russell, Marcus Lee, and Tom Pike, are also opening up their homes. Among the public buildings making their debut this year are the University of London's Senate House, the Royal Institute of International Affairs, popularly known as Chatham House, and Macks Mews, a 19th century paper factory converted for housing. Many of the 550 buildings involved are normally closed to the public, or have very restricted public access. For the Open House weekend, now in its eighth year, the buildings' owners allow visitors in free of charge. In 1999, more than 450 buildings were open to the public and 320,000 visits were made over the 48-hour period. This year more than 500,000 are expected to take up the opportunity.

Then we ran into a brick wall.\" This was the Prudential, the Quarter's developer and landlord, which is applying for planning permission to turn the shop into a cafe. A spokesman denied opposition to a bra outlet in principle and said the decision to look for a catering outlet had been made before Bravissimo's interest. But Leeds's ampler ladies have responded eagerly to a Bravissimo appeal sent to 900 local mail order clients. One emailed: \"Perhaps we are in the realm of schoolboy giggles here. If so, I can assure everyone that Bravissimo sells its clothes in a straightforward and wholly tasteful way.\"",

Literally, a rocket took off with a logo on the side. Figuratively the pizza business took off too. </p> <p>Most of the guides to good English have something to say about \"literally\". The Teach Yourself Concise Dictionary of Correct English, for example, reminds us of the rigour of the literal definition. \"Literally means 'exactly in accordance with the meaning of the word(s)' to which 'literally' is attached.\" </p> <p>The author of this book, BA Phythian, by way of illustration, says it is only acceptable to say that a thief was literally caught red-handed if he had red hands. Literally, Phythian says, is often wrongly used in this way, merely as a means of emphasis, with some ridiculous consequences, \"The players literally ran out of steam.\" </p> <p>Godfrey Howard, in The Macmillan Good English Handbook, takes a more relaxed view. He says, \"If a knife is literally as sharp as a razor, it should be possible to shave with it. But literally is so often used to mean, not in reality but in a manner of speaking: 'dinner at that restaurant literally costs the earth'.\" </p> <p>He adds, \"This use of 'literally' is far too common to make a fuss about it, but we might prefer to be careful ourselves to use 'literally' only when we mean in reality.\" One of the things for the writer to consider, he suggests, is whether the word could be left out altogether. </p> <p>The best piece of advice, I think, is that given in The New Fowler's Modern English usage, but we shall come to that in a moment. The reader who (literally) started this train of thought, enclosed two extracts from the autobiography of the author Compton Mackenzie, who revealed in a letter to the Evening Standard in about 1928, \"An amusement of mine for many years has been collecting 'literallys'\" (My Life and Times, Octave 6, 1923-30). </p> <p>Sir Compton offered a few items from his collection, including one from the Evening Standard itself \"when a distinguished Admiral was said to have literally won his spurs at the Battle of Jutland,\" and another, from a court report in which the accused was said to have \"literally gone to pieces after his arrest\". </p> <p>He concluded his letter to the Standard, \"As I write these words I hear on the Wireless from Mr PF Warner that WG Grace 'literally' killed the fast bowlers of the last century, which must have kept his brother EM, the coroner, fairly busy\" (ah, my Warner and my Grace, long ago). </p> <p>Mackenzie thought it was much too kind to the culprits to excuse them simply for mistaking \"literally\" with \"figuratively\". \"Are they not looking for one of those wretched augmentatives which, like inflated tics, batten on the language?\" - an augmentative in this sense being a word whose purpose is to emphasise or reinforce the word or phrase to which it is attached. So \"literally\" sacrifices its own true meaning to lend its weight to all manner of outrageous statements. </p> <p>The results, as we have seen are often so amusing that it seems a bit churlish to complain. We do not want to be spoilsports, do we? We knew exactly what Bel Littlejohn, a famously forthright columnist, meant when she wrote in her own vivid way, \"I went into Melvyn's office unannounced and found him... sitting beneath a literally shattering new piece by Damien Hirst.\" </p> <p>The reader, who raised \"literally\", by the way, also suggested that it had been joined by \"famously\" as what he called \"the wretched augmentative of 2000\". He quoted from our recent rerun of the Lady Chatterley trial when the prosecution counsel \"famously\" asked the jury, \"Is it a book you would wish your wife or servants to read?\" On Monday this week we used \"famously\" in 10 separate pieces, certainly qualifying the word as a cliche. </p> <p>Now, the final word on \"literally\" from the New Fowler, which after an example from the Guardian, 1995, \"They [the supermarkets] can literally play God, even to the point of sending food back to the genetic drawing board for a redesign,\"concludes its discussion with the following words of advice, \"It's a case of 'stop, look and think' before using the word in any manner short of its exact sense.\" </p> <p>Precisely. Do that and we shall get along famously. </p> <p>\u0095 Many thanks to Rod Prince for suggesting the subject of this column.

He says, \"If a knife is literally as sharp as a razor, it should be possible to shave with it. But literally is so often used to mean, not in reality but in a manner of speaking: 'dinner at that restaurant literally costs the earth'.\" He adds, \"This use of 'literally' is far too common to make a fuss about it, but we might prefer to be careful ourselves to use 'literally' only when we mean in reality.\" One of the things for the writer to consider, he suggests, is whether the word could be left out altogether. The best piece of advice, I think, is that given in The New Fowler's Modern English usage, but we shall come to that in a moment. The reader who (literally) started this train of thought, enclosed two extracts from the autobiography of the author Compton Mackenzie, who revealed in a letter to the Evening Standard in about 1928, \"An amusement of mine for many years has been collecting 'literallys'\" (My Life and Times, Octave 6, 1923-30). Sir Compton offered a few items from his collection, including one from the Evening Standard itself \"when a distinguished Admiral was said to have literally won his spurs at the Battle of Jutland,\" and another, from a court report in which the accused was said to have \"literally gone to pieces after his arrest\". He concluded his letter to the Standard, \"As I write these words I hear on the Wireless from Mr PF Warner that WG Grace 'literally' killed the fast bowlers of the last century, which must have kept his brother EM, the coroner, fairly busy\" (ah, my Warner and my Grace, long ago). Mackenzie thought it was much too kind to the culprits to excuse them simply for mistaking \"literally\" with \"figuratively\". \"Are they not looking for one of those wretched augmentatives which, like inflated tics, batten on the language?\" - an augmentative in this sense being a word whose purpose is to emphasise or reinforce the word or phrase to which it is attached. So \"literally\" sacrifices its own true meaning to lend its weight to all manner of outrageous statements. The results, as we have seen are often so amusing that it seems a bit churlish to complain. We do not want to be spoilsports, do we? We knew exactly what Bel Littlejohn, a famously forthright columnist, meant when she wrote in her own vivid way, \"I went into Melvyn's office unannounced and found him... sitting beneath a literally shattering new piece by Damien Hirst.\" The reader, who raised \"literally\", by the way, also suggested that it had been joined by \"famously\" as what he called \"the wretched augmentative of 2000\". He quoted from our recent rerun of the Lady Chatterley trial when the prosecution counsel \"famously\" asked the jury, \"Is it a book you would wish your wife or servants to read?\" On Monday this week we used \"famously\" in 10 separate pieces, certainly qualifying the word as a cliche. Now, the final word on \"literally\" from the New Fowler, which after an example from the Guardian, 1995, \"They [the supermarkets] can literally play God, even to the point of sending food back to the genetic drawing board for a redesign,\"concludes its discussion with the following words of advice, \"It's a case of 'stop, look and think' before using the word in any manner short of its exact sense.\" Precisely. Do that and we shall get along famously. \u0095 Many thanks to Rod Prince for suggesting the subject of this column.

This is a one-way rivalry. On the whole, people who support England at any sport would like England to win, but the special edge of longing, resentment and hatred some Scots feel for us is largely absent from our feelings about them. I said I thought that, if anything, we are more competitive with France.

Since Labour has petulently stopped going to Blackpool and the Tories refuse to go to Brighton, in the manner of a small boy stalking off with his football, Bournemouth gets more political conferences than anywhere else. </p> <p>\"Mind you,\" my driver continued, \"we gave them Liberals a try here.

Prats. Nice prats, but prats all the same.\" </p> <p>That night I spoke at my daughter's school speech day, and the only thing I said which raised even a frisson of disagreement was a defence of politicians. We all love to abuse them, I went on, but they were better than the alternative, which is rule by unelected despots. So perhaps the Liberal Democrats shouldn't worry too much. Our genial contempt is the tribute we pay to those set over us. It's only when you have real power that people even feel the need to call you prats. </p> <p> \u0095 Sir Richard Branson dramatically announces that he is about to launch an airship which will cruise over Kosovo looking for unexploded landmines. The news is reported absolutely straight in the newspapers, rather in the manner of the old court circulars, as if it was self-evidently true and needed no elaboration. But it has been an awful week for Branson. Camelot won the vital court ruling over the Lottery on Thursday, and in spite of legal sabre-rattling he was unable to prevent the serialisation of the highly critical book by the investigative writer Tom Bower in the Daily Mail this week. </p> <p>It paints a picture quite unlike the genial, bearded, be-sweatered philanthropist which Branson presents to the world, and I look forward to reading his reply. His response to all bad news is, rather like New Labour, to produce a new publicity stunt, so I was not remotely surprised to see that he now has the spectacular chutzpah to re-brand himself as Princess Diana. </p> <p> Perhaps we shouldn't repeat Posh 'n' Becks jokes, considering the stuff that gets shouted at David Beckham by the more loathsome football fans. But this one seems innocent enough: Posh 'n' Becks get into a cab. \"Where to, guv?\" asks the driver. \"What's that station where you can get a train to Brighton?\" asks Becks. \"That'd be Victoria,\" says the driver. \"Thanks very much,\" Beckham replies, turning to his wife. \"Victoria, what restaurant are we supposed to be going to?\" </p> <p>\u0095 Twice in the past week I've had arguments with friends and family about this point of grammar: should one say \"he is taller than me\" or \"he is taller than I\" (or shorter or dafter or whatever)?

Since Smallweed will shortly be visiting Normandy and cannot dance, this information is timely. </p> <p>Brian Robinson of Brentwood, however, has a different edition of Brewer, since his, when you look up white knight, refers you to Tirant lo Blanch, a romance written in Catalan and produced in Valencia in 1490, loved by Cervantes, but not published in translation in England until 1984. Tirant's story, says my informant, to some extent parallels that of Guy of Warwick. This Guy, it emerges, was a doer of doughty deeds, who among other triumphs slew the Dun Cow, a monster which lived in Shropshire. The Cow's milk was thought to be inexhaustible, but one day an old woman who had already filled her pail from this source attempted to fill her sieve as well, whereupon the Cow, uncannily prefiguring the forecourt rage of our own day, became so enraged that it killed her. Guy was later reduced to begging outside his own castle. Even that cannot convince me that someone like Tirant lo Blanch is the right man to ride to the aid of the London stock exchange. </p> <p> A s to Gawain and the green giant, also aired here last week, that too is a tale too long to tell in full, but it boils down to this. A giant clad entirely in green challenged Gawain to a duel with axes. Gawain smote the giant's head from its body, which he thought should force a submission, but instead the body picked up its head and demanded a replay in 12 months' time. </p> <p>On the eve of this shoot-out, the knight stayed in a castle and did a deal with its lord that what either acquired should be passed on to the other. So when the lord's wife turned up in his bedchamber and sought to seduce him with kisses, he passed the kisses on to the lord. When he and the giant eventually met, Gawain was duly smitten, but wounded, not killed. The reason for this, it emerged, was that the green giant was actually the lord in disguise. The wife had been sent to tempt Gawain, but, because he stayed chaste, his life had been spared. </p> <p>It is understood that when the news reached Camelot, the rest of the knights were overjoyed, and celebrated as if they had just won a contract to run a national lottery. Though he was not around at the time, Mike Connelly thinks by email that the giant went by the name of Sir Bercelak de Hautdesert. Even his blood was green, as it emerged, you might say, when he was beheaded. </p> <p> A drenched person coming out of the rain the other day claimed it was raining stair rods. The concept of raining cats and dogs is weird enough, but at least explicable in terms of legends which make the cat an agent of bad weather and links dogs with the wind. But why stair rods?

The villains, a hard-hitting piece by Sin Simon argued, were the \"avaricious, colluding, nasty, spiteful, grey-suited bean counters at the heart of our fuel companies\". \"The rabid greed that runs through oil companies like a dirty petrol stain beggars belief,\" he added deftly. But a columnist in the Daily Telegraph picked out a different culprit entirely. The British people, a hard-hitting piece by Sin Simon argued, had failed to note the disparity between the good-natured anarchism of the general public and the sinister, hypocritical self-interest of the so-called protestors - \"terrorists would be a better word\". Yet the public, he believed, was too canny not to perceive over time that such types were \"more the scum than the salt of the earth\". Perhaps Sin had assumed that the scum read the News of the World and not the Daily Telegraph. The avalanche of complaint which has followed, complete with demands that he be sacked/keelhauled/dismembered with all possible violence/ excommunicated, will have enlightened him now. Next week in Smallweed: why I blame Tranmere Rovers FC for this fiasco: a hard-hitting piece by Sin Smene-or-ther. Having rescued one ailing TV station with a glove puppet, Greg Dyke is attempting to repeat the trick at the BBC. Political editor Andrew Marr's reports on Tony Blair's handling of the fuel crisis were delivered with all the gravitas of a knitted sock - Letter from R Oakley to Tuesday's Daily Mail. That's Richard of Luton, Beds, by the way, not Robin. We may be a little closer to establishing the identity of the original white knight.

My distinguished predecessor Philip Hope-Wallace used to encounter the same query as he trotted off to another Tosca. But, in a week when Julius Caesar and The Cherry Orchard are on the agenda, it's a perfectly valid question: how does the critic stay fresh when confronted by constantly revived works? </p> <p>Hamlet, for me, is not a problem: it is too pluralistic in method, too unpindownable in meaning ever to stale. Above all, each revival offers not just a revelation of the actor's soul but a reflection of society. Take an obvious contrast. Peter Hall's 1965 Stratford production was a highly political affair in which David Warner's bescarved prince was spiritually alienated by the complex manouevrings at Elsinore. Now John Caird's National Theatre revival strips the play of politics altogether: the assumption - though this was before the quasi-fascist revolt over petrol prices - is that we live in totally apolitical times and that our only interest lies in the individual sensibility. It's an overtly romantic reading that tells us a lot about Caird and even more about our self-preoccupied age. </p> <p>Hamlet is a mirror that gives back a picture of ourselves. But what is fascinating about Shakespeare is the way certain plays acquire a renewed vividness at particular moments in time. Peter Brook compares them to planets that either swing closer to the earth in its orbit or drift away. For Brook the bitterness of Timon of Athens brings it into focus, while Othello's jealousy is out of our range: broadly true except that it just takes one exceptional revival - such as Sam Mendes's meticulous Othello - to rescue a play from temporary oblivion. </p> <p>But the perennial danger with Shakespeare is that the plays get revived more out of civic duty than expressive need: I'd defy any director of the RSC not to admit there are times when they've put on A Midsummer Night's Dream or Romeo and Juliet not because of any commandingly fresh vision, but simply because of the Bardic equivalent of Buggins' Turn. And if critics occasionally sound weary in the face of another return to Athens, Arden or Verona, it is because they can detect the theatrical equivalent of crop rotation. </p> <p>That is why I bang on about the need to expand the Shakespearean repertory rather than rely on a dozen-or-so box office certs. And I would argue there is a palpable excitement at Stratford this year about the exploration of the Histories. Even the deliberate discontinuity, whereby the plays are staged in widely differing styles on a variety of stages, becomes a comment on contemporary Britain. We live in a fragmented, possibly dissolving kingdom: instead of approaching the plays with the Victorian assurance that they deal with the restoration of order, we find in them an echo of our scepticism about power. </p> <p>Given a strong directorial intention, I have no problem in staying fresh for Shakespeare: my only difficulty lies with particular spaces such as the Bankside Globe. But different questions arise with post-1880s naturalistic drama where the variations are more closely calibrated. No two King Lears or Tempests ever look or sound alike. But how many ways are there of doing Ghosts or The Cherry Orchard without violating the play? You update Chekhov at your peril: I remember a post- revolutionary Cherry Orchard in which the characters seemed to be survivors of a seismic social eruption which the text itself anticipates. </p> <p>Chekhov, to come clean, is difficult for the critic. Of course, one loves the plays. Of course, in a great production, one constantly re-discovers them. Peter Stein represented the ravishing beauty of the white-blossomed cherry orchard in a way which made its destruction unbearable. Terry Hands in The Seagull, by placing the interval after the third act, devastatingly showed how Nina and Konstantin are bruised by time while the older characters remain impermeable. What I am dead against, which once led me to demand a three-year moratorium on Chekhov, is the kind of lazy, linen-suited revival which simply swathes the plays in sentimental atmosphere: fortunately there are fewer of those around than there used to be. </p> <p>I find myself constantly refreshed by what Jonathan Miller calls the \"afterlife\" of a classic, its possibility of successive re- creation. But the job of a critic would be much easier - and the vitality of the theatre much greater - if we widened the existing repertory. You'd be astonished how many great and not so great plays still go unperformed. </p> <p> It was a shock this week in Halifax to realise I'd never before seen Euripides' Alcestis on stage: in a sense one still hasn't - since this is a radical Ted Hughes adaptation. The Greeks, the Germans, the French: there are still large tracts of unexplored territory. Even Ibsen we know only in part: I once saw Love's Comedy in rep and The League of Youth at a drama school but I suspect that's it for my lifetime. </p> <p>Critics themselves are part of the problem: they trot out the old phrase \"deservedly neglected\" when confronted by anything less than a mainstream classic. Audiences too are wretchedly conservative. But the real problem lies with managements who, with a few notable exceptions, stick with winning formulae with the commercial myopia of a Hollywood mogul. </p> <p>It has struck me lately, for instance, that we are staggeringly ignorant of British drama from 1900 to 1950. Barrie's Dear Brutus is coming up at Nottingham and Maugham's The Circle at the Oxford Stage Company. But we know next-to-nothing of Pinero, St John Ervine or Monkhouse, not to mention Galsworthy, Bridie or Priestley, aside from An Inspector Calls. If I sometimes get critically testy, it is not with the revival of another Hamlet or The Cherry Orchard, these are great plays one can go on rediscovering all one's life. It is with the debilitating narrowness of the British repertory and with our failure to realise that, outside the accepted masterpieces, lies a wealth of undiscovered plays.

But, given the provocation of her seven-week recharting of Jacques's Seven Ages of Man speech, the time has come. </p> <p>Yes, it's on Radio 2, and on a weekend lunchtime slot at that, and yes, it's a stringing together of thematically linked clips, so it's never going to be avant garde. All that said, this men-are-crap-and-women-eat-cakes series is as woolly and rancidly stiltonesque as any Radio 2 show of old, with a mixed bag of clips (ranging from fairly amusing to painful) on manhood, held together with the lamest jokes from Brand. I'd sit down before you face the soul-destroyer that is, for example: \"Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms? That sounds like me on my holidays in Ibiza\" or \"Bet you didn't think I could move that fast without the aid of a curry.\" If those haven't got you reaching for the Complete Works of the Bard and a stiff drink, perhaps this one will do it for you: \"Is there a Fathercare? Yes, it's called the pub.\" </p> <p>Have we nipped back to 1975 and nobody thought to tell me? This stagnant men-bashing stuff is from another planet, especially when there are real bad meanies out there (see below) who are rather more complicated creatures than Brand would have us believe. I know it's an act, love, but that's really no excuse. </p> <p>Come at this manly business via the excellent It's My Story: Loving Men, Living Lies (Radio 4) and you might well reach the same conclusions as Brand, but at least you would have several broken hearts and shattered egos as evidence. Two women, both bright, smart and seemingly alert to cad-detecting, fell for romantic imposters peddling cheesy chat-up lines. Even though both had misgivings after initial meetings (always go with those, people), they entered into serious, near marital relationships with the philandering fibbers. </p> <p>Rosie, 49, fell for the \"size of the gesture\" (I know, cue cheap Jo Brand gag) when a stranger stopped her in the street and remarked on her \"staggering beauty\". After that he stood her up, wasn't on the mobile number he gave her and wasn't who he said he was, but still she went for dinner with him. \"It was intensely flattering,\" she said, even if it all felt unreal: he wanted commitment; he told her he loved her on their second meeting and no one had told her that for almost 20 years; he soon proposed. As scant credentials for him she had the fact that he knew the coach of the British Olympic rowing team and that he recognised a piece of obscure classical music. I wish that had been enough, but instead Rosie discovered she was only one of at least 15 women. </p> <p>It all sounds silly, eh, and you would have sent him packing? The strength of this programme was that it unravelled the insecurity that leads women to take in these dodgy charmers in the first pace.

Like a disco in a minefield. </p> <p>Still, it started well. Martin handed everyone orange juice, Gail did some brisk ironing while David watched telly. There isn't much else Little David does. He watches more telly than everyone else in the Street put together, probably more than anyone in all of Soapland. It's a wonder he has got time to stomp around complaining about \"Beth'ny the buh-bey,\" what with a telly habit like his (though he may coincide his stomping with the ad breaks). </p> <p>Anyway, such was the hope emanating from the Platt house on Family Day, there was even a little labrador puppy on the kitchen calendar, all bright eyes and floppy ears. Alas it wasn't to last, as we know only too well that the Platts follow the Manson family model as opposed to the Waltons one. </p> <p>Quick as a quick thing, Sarah - who, having so spectacularly lost her virginity has now lost her Lou - and Gail started bickering about Bethany's welfare. \"She's my baby,\" Sarah snarled, displaying at least a grasp of How Babies Are Made. How wise she is in retrospect. If only she'd worked it out earlier, she might still have been in a position to go to Candice's to watch videos without a care in the world. (Apart from the nagging doubt that the rest of the neighbourhood would soon turn up on her parents' doorstep carrying blazing torches and chanting \"Burn the evil ones\".) </p> <p>As it is, she can't, though that didn't stop Spindly - but oddly paunchy - Martin saying it was okay. To no one's surprise, it wasn't okay with Gail. Gail, who has been exploding more frequently than a volcano with an overactive thyroid, wanted Sarah to act like an adult which, it would seem, doesn't involve watching videos (or indeed telly) but does entail arguing in the garden. And in front of Barney the rabbit too. It would be enough to make anyone pack their bags and leave - which is exactly what Sarah did, pitching up at Roy and Hayley's. You couldn't say for sure, but that labrador's eyes seemed a little bit dimmer. </p> <p>Sarah, an unlucky girl from the core of her chromosomes to the tips of her pigtails, hadn't found her Lou, but she did have a collapsible cot which she planned to un- collapse in their spare room just round from the \"Arthur Askey in The Love Racket\" poster. (The Love Racket, incidentally, was written by Noel Gay who also wrote the song Run, Rabbit, Run, which may well be advice Barney would like to heed before he too gets dragged into the Platt's internecine squabbles). Roy wasn't too keen on Sarah's tenancy but Hayley was wetting herself with excitement at the prospect of having Sarah and Bethany under her roof. Well, it looked like excitement, but it might have been due to an unfortunate oversight on the part of her surgeons. </p> <p>Some people will do anything to leave Coronation Street, but confessing to murder is a bit extreme. It seems Jim McDonald couldn't stand his stick-on pine dado rail and his floral and forlorn oven gloves any longer, preferring a jail cell with a thin mattress and a love heart scrawled on the wall. Strangely, to Steve at least, he seemed calm and collected and quite happy in a netball bib in prison. Compared to being married to Liz and going out with Grasping Gwen, it must seem like a holiday camp. But with nicer bedlinen. </p> <p>Vera, meanwhile, had an even more desperate plan to escape Weatherfield: moving to Blackpool. And were that not enough, she's planning decamping to be near Gary Mallett and his devil children. No wonder Jack's lollipop is looking a bit wobbly. </p> <p>Often, I find myself expressing empathy for Elle Macpherson. Whether I'm cleaning the loo or taking the bins out, queueing in the post office or wondering whether to have semi-skimmed or skimmed milk in my latte, I think \"This is exactly like Elle's life. We are surely soulmates.\" And so in Friends (Channel 4), I find myself agreeing with her over the annoying aspects of the other friends. Especially Ross.</p>",

Now he says of his marriage and fatherhood, in the midst of an 18-page photospread, \"There's a joy and contentment that's almost palpable to both of us; overnight, our lives have been enriched beyond belief.\"</p> <p>And Michael Douglas - he of the substance abuse and sex addiction, whose wife once found him in bed with her best friend - now simpers in the middle of a 21-page feature (mine's bigger than yours, Limey!) that \"I'm the official burper!\" (Of the baby, one hopes.) </p> <p>Of course, no one would turn down the chance of shacking up with Iman or Catherine Zeta-Jones, and goodness knows I'm not condemning dumping spouses and moving on in one's life - what, me, the Daily Mail's official Worst Mother in Britain? But there is something vile about men such as Bowie and Douglas, who are forever drawing attention to their own alleged integrity and liberal politics, not only cashing in on their private lives, but proclaiming them with such gluttonous gloating. Why should we give them any more credibility than we do to the Turner-Boveys? Yet, regardless of these grabfests, we undoubtedly will continue to read about Bowie's dedication to his art and Douglas's anti-Hollywood stance. </p> <p>To my mind, you can't really blame a Turner or a Bovey for selling their souls: they are creatures only of and for the marketplace, with no resonance or responsibility in our culture. (No teenager ever sat sobbing in her bedroom, \"Oh, I hate my life - only Anthea Turner understands me!\")</p> <p>On the other hand, the sex and drugs counterculture that both Bowie and Douglas enjoyed and exploited so flagrantly was, on balance, a far better thing than the joyless repression it replaced.

      "byline": "Alexander Chancellor",

      "body": "<p>The fading petrol crisis - fading for the people of Britain if not for the government - now feels like something of a missed opportunity. The fuel shortages caused disruption and hardship across the whole country, and united its people in resentment against high petrol taxes. But where was the Dunkirk spirit that is supposed to envelop us at times like this? </p> <p>Perhaps if the blockade had lasted longer - if the country really had been brought to its knees - it would have made its appearance. Perhaps then people with just a little petrol left would have been moved to share it with the more needy, would have used up their remaining supplies to drive old people to hospital or other people's children to school. Perhaps they would have cheerfully made way for others in any remaining petrol queues. Perhaps they would have done the shopping for their neighbours at Tesco or have volunteered to drive doctors on their rounds to visit the sick. But I could detect no sign of such a spirit last week. It was the same old bloody-minded, me-first, fuck-you Britain that we have become accustomed to in these prosperous, materialistic days. </p> <p>I was only just born at the time of Dunkirk, so I didn't consciously experience the coming together of the nation in a mood of self-sacrifice in our darkest hour. But even then little pockets of traditional bloody-mindedness remained. My late mother recalled how, one day in 1940, she was having a cup of tea in a cafe on the south coast just before 5pm when it was due to close. The cafe-owner was already pulling down the shutters when a group of exhausted and bedraggled British soldiers in muddy uniforms appeared at the door, begging for something to eat or drink. The lady said firmly that they were too late, but then my mother told her that she would punch her on the nose if she didn't shut up and went behind the counter herself to serve them tea and sandwiches. It subsequently transpired that they were some of the first British soldiers to escape from Dunkirk. </p> <p>But that incident clearly wasn't typical. We pulled together then. We were united in a common cause - the defeat of the Nazis - and the unfamiliar solidarity between British people of all classes and backgrounds made us feel happy and proud of ourselves. Since the war, there have been occasional efforts to revive such national solidarity and appeals by political leaders to the Dunkirk spirit, but they have never really worked. There have been plenty of crises, but never one quite profound enough to wean us from our selfish ways. The petrol crisis seems to have made us, if anything, more self-centred than usual. </p> <p>I, certainly, thought only of myself. I wanted to drive to the country last weekend, so I got up early to go out in search of an open petrol station in London that wasn't giving priority to worthy people such as nurses and doctors. I was lucky. I found one quite quickly, and got to the front of the queue in only half an hour. But driving home complacently with my full tank, I had to make a left turn beside a much longer line of motorists waiting for petrol on Shepherd's Bush Green. There were hundreds of them, and they all looked at me with hatred and suspicion as I sneaked past them on the left-hand side in an effort to get to my turning. It seems to have occurred to none of them that I wasn't trying to jump their queue. </p> <p> I made excellent progress, but was finally prevented from turning left by a single car which blocked my path and refused to move out of the way, although it had plenty of room to do so. I hooted and gesticulated to indicate my intention, but the driver was steadfast. It was only after I got out of my car and shouted at him through his closed window that I only wanted to turn left that this furious man grudgingly edged forward to make this possible. </p> <p>Having all the petrol I wanted, my hatred turned against those who hadn't. Bloody fools, I thought. What do they need it for? I was heavily delayed on the way out of London by two petrol queues on each side of a road, causing a major traffic jam in the middle of it. </p> <p>As the radio informed me, celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of the Battle of Britain were being held that weekend, and - who knows? - there might have been war veterans in those queues.

      "bodyText": "The fading petrol crisis - fading for the people of Britain if not for the government - now feels like something of a missed opportunity. The fuel shortages caused disruption and hardship across the whole country, and united its people in resentment against high petrol taxes. But where was the Dunkirk spirit that is supposed to envelop us at times like this? Perhaps if the blockade had lasted longer - if the country really had been brought to its knees - it would have made its appearance. Perhaps then people with just a little petrol left would have been moved to share it with the more needy, would have used up their remaining supplies to drive old people to hospital or other people's children to school. Perhaps they would have cheerfully made way for others in any remaining petrol queues. Perhaps they would have done the shopping for their neighbours at Tesco or have volunteered to drive doctors on their rounds to visit the sick. But I could detect no sign of such a spirit last week. It was the same old bloody-minded, me-first, fuck-you Britain that we have become accustomed to in these prosperous, materialistic days. I was only just born at the time of Dunkirk, so I didn't consciously experience the coming together of the nation in a mood of self-sacrifice in our darkest hour. But even then little pockets of traditional bloody-mindedness remained. My late mother recalled how, one day in 1940, she was having a cup of tea in a cafe on the south coast just before 5pm when it was due to close. The cafe-owner was already pulling down the shutters when a group of exhausted and bedraggled British soldiers in muddy uniforms appeared at the door, begging for something to eat or drink. The lady said firmly that they were too late, but then my mother told her that she would punch her on the nose if she didn't shut up and went behind the counter herself to serve them tea and sandwiches. It subsequently transpired that they were some of the first British soldiers to escape from Dunkirk. But that incident clearly wasn't typical. We pulled together then. We were united in a common cause - the defeat of the Nazis - and the unfamiliar solidarity between British people of all classes and backgrounds made us feel happy and proud of ourselves. Since the war, there have been occasional efforts to revive such national solidarity and appeals by political leaders to the Dunkirk spirit, but they have never really worked. There have been plenty of crises, but never one quite profound enough to wean us from our selfish ways. The petrol crisis seems to have made us, if anything, more self-centred than usual. I, certainly, thought only of myself. I wanted to drive to the country last weekend, so I got up early to go out in search of an open petrol station in London that wasn't giving priority to worthy people such as nurses and doctors. I was lucky. I found one quite quickly, and got to the front of the queue in only half an hour. But driving home complacently with my full tank, I had to make a left turn beside a much longer line of motorists waiting for petrol on Shepherd's Bush Green. There were hundreds of them, and they all looked at me with hatred and suspicion as I sneaked past them on the left-hand side in an effort to get to my turning. It seems to have occurred to none of them that I wasn't trying to jump their queue. I made excellent progress, but was finally prevented from turning left by a single car which blocked my path and refused to move out of the way, although it had plenty of room to do so. I hooted and gesticulated to indicate my intention, but the driver was steadfast. It was only after I got out of my car and shouted at him through his closed window that I only wanted to turn left that this furious man grudgingly edged forward to make this possible. Having all the petrol I wanted, my hatred turned against those who hadn't. Bloody fools, I thought. What do they need it for? I was heavily delayed on the way out of London by two petrol queues on each side of a road, causing a major traffic jam in the middle of it. As the radio informed me, celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of the Battle of Britain were being held that weekend, and - who knows? - there might have been war veterans in those queues. But who cared? I was only interested in getting on my way. It clearly takes rather more than a petrol crisis to turn us into decent human beings again. Roll on world war three.",

The stained glass above the door is fake, of course, but it spells my name in real hieroglyphics.\" </p> <p>The hall is in the Art Deco style, he continues, as we step into a weeny inner vestibule. Indeed, it includes an \"interpretation\" of the lift doors in the Chrysler Building in New York. I would have stayed and had a closer look (it's all done in cut cork, gold card and picture-framing offcuts), but I am drawn inwards by a tantalising glimpse of living-room decor - a bit of \"faux\" marbling, a baroque trompe l'oeil landscape and a throne-like gilded chair with leopard-print upholstery, crests and tassels entwined with Victorian plasterwork. </p> <p>\"Wow!\" is all I can think of to say as we enter the room, where I am instantly supplied with a helpful leaflet (entitled Private Residence Of Brian Lewis) explaining that the decor is \"pure fantasy... not intended to be taken too seriously, but enjoyed for what it is - a dream, an escape from the outside world\". </p> <p>The text also gives a brief resum\u00e9 of the room's furnishing highlights (the 1935 Bechstein piano attributed as the property of Captain Cheshire \"of Battle Of Britain fame\"; the animal-print couch by architect-designer Ettore Sottsass \"of the Italian Memphis style\"). But there are so many things, and so much going on, it's hard to know where to look first. </p> <p>Lewis will, no doubt, be handing out leaflets to more dazzled and, indeed, dazed visitors when he opens his flat as part of this weekend's London Open House - the annual \"celebration of architecture\" that invites the public into some of the capital's most intriguing inner spaces that are closed for the remainder of the year. </p> <p>Of the hundreds of participating buildings, only 40 are private residences and, of those, the majority are the homes of architects (or clients of architects). For them, it's a chance to flaunt new projects or, in the true spirit of the event, to engage in a dialogue with the public about \"the quality of the spaces we inhabit\". What they tend to show is cool, white, contemporary spaces in sparsely furnished, glassy houses. So, Lewis's flat is a bit of a one-off. </p> <p>Lewis is not an architect, but a muralist and decorative painter (gilding, sponging, staining, stencilling, etc). He doesn't do white spaces (the decoration, he says, \"is the absolute antithesis of the current vogue for minimalism\"). And he is certainly alone among Open Housers to claim Ludwig II - the \"mad king of Bavaria\" - as his mentor. Ludwig not only did themed rooms at least a century before Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen was born, but he indulged his passion for over-the-top interiors by creating the extravagant German castles, Linderhof and Neuschwanstein - each a jangling confusion of the Byzantine, the baroque, neo-Gothic and Romanesque. </p> <p>\"He has had a great deal of influence on me,\" says Lewis, adding that he \"loves the idea of a house where every room is a surprise and you can move from one to the other, depending on your mood\". He is influenced, too, by his own world-wide travels, and the tradition of the Grand Tours (in which 18th- and 19th-century travellers returned from the Ancient world with marble columns, classical statues and wild ideas for garden temples and grottoes). He is also driven by a compulsive decorating habit. Decorating, he says, is a kind of therapy; something he can't help doing. </p> <p>The flat, therefore, is in a constant state of transformation. The bedroom used to be an \"arboretum\" - a wood with trees and branches reaching over the bed - until a visit to southeast Asia inspired a mini Thai temple, complete with sacred elephants, lotus blossoms and the sweet smell of incense. \"At one time, the living room was very white and Deco-ish,\" says Lewis. \"But I just got fed up with it. I'm not very good at cleaning, you see, so if something gets dirty, I just paint it.\" </p> <p>He doesn't, of course, just paint any old thing. The richly emulsioned murals on his living-room walls represent a \"very personal diary\" - a kind of pictorial album of buildings and monuments he has seen and loved in places he's visited (Salzburg, Beijing, Istanbul, Prague, the Bavarian Alps). It also features a lot of memorabilia - such as his childhood dog (Montgomery Hector Oscar Lewis), the pasted newspaper cutting of his mother's obituary (she was a novelist), the painting of Brian and friends in a hot-air balloon rising towards the ceiling, where clouds float alongside winged Renaissance cherubs across a duck-egg blue sky. </p> <p>Sounds ghastly? Well, yes, it could be - and it's certainly a hellish place for obsessive modernists. But Lewis's skilful trompe l'oeil effects (pillars, loggias, statues, romantic Arcadian landscapes) give this mad, chaotic ensemble a sensible, architectural framework. And though he is the first to admit that much of what he's created is as ephemeral as a stage set (\"you are not supposed to look at anything too closely\"), there are some genuinely good pieces among his amazing collection of props. </p> <p>During this weekend's tours, Lewis will no doubt point out that the living room's black Corinthian rug (partially obscuring his mock-flagstone, paint-effect floor) is a limited edition by Spanish designer Esteban Figuerola. The gold thrones, he will say, are identical to chairs seen in the television version of Brideshead Revisited and Kenneth Branagh's film of Hamlet. The chrome-and-glass coffee table is \"in the style of Eileen Gray\" and could be the real thing. He will show off engravings by Paula Rego; a Victorian jardini\u00e8re that once belonged to Elton John; and Art Deco-style curtains (\"with tasselly bits\") made by Lewis after visiting the Prague concert hall. </p> <p>\"Then we've got the Empire clock and matching alabaster vases,\" he continues. \"I put lights in them, and they look quite spectacular when lit up.\" Lewis thinks nothing of, say, sticking brass candlesticks to the frame of a French crystal mirror. Or attaching a sequined elephant to the original Verner Panton wire chair in his bedroom. \"I imagine Verner would be very upset, if he was still alive,\" he admits. </p> <p>Aside from elephants, the Thai bedroom features a home-made four-poster bed crowned with lights, a ceiling of stick-on stars and two parallel walls of mirrored tiles. The latter reflect one of those infinite sequences of fractured images. For me, it's a bit scary - but it's not until we enter the \"black magic\" dining room that I start to worry about Brian Lewis. </p> <p>You have to admire the painstaking ceiling mosaic (all made from tiny squares of cut card), but Lewis's dining room is a creepy mix of Hammer horror, science fiction and esoteric symbolism - Tarot cards, astrology (he's an Aquarian), serpents and devilry. The table is suspended on chains and set with a little tableau of skulls; there are nasty looking spikes on the set of metal chairs, each of which is decorated with a hideous mask and a writhing snake. </p> <p>\"Some people are very uncomfortable with this room, particularly with the snakes,\" he says. \"But I like to get a reaction... and I'd rather people said they hated it than said nothing at all. Anyway, they are only rubber snakes, like the ones you buy in joke shops.\" Beyond a relatively normal kitchen, there is another joke to be shared: a bathroom in the form of a Ludwigian grotto, dressed from head to foot in rock-look papier-mch\u00e9 and plaster, and hung with trailing plastic foliage. There are weird test-tube taps, a cracked-mirror floor, a television set into a craggy recess in the wall, a fake frog in the sink (it covers up a hole in the porcelain), a spooky little skeleton fountain that comes on when you switch on the light. </p> <p>\"Nothing's meant to be taken seriously,\" says Lewis. \"I'm experimenting with techniques, but I'm also having a laugh - and it's not meant to be good taste.\" </p> <p>Still, there is a serious side to the Brian Lewis style of interior design. Among numerous private commissions, he's just completed a mural in the surgery of a Holland Park dentist, who wanted something to distract his patients (\"I painted a lot of animals and the odd toothbrush\"). He has also lectured in design history at the London Institute. And though his own environment is a little unorthodox, some of his Open House guests are sure to come away with a few ideas: such as how to turn \"a crappy little apartment\", as he calls it, into a palace of treasures; or to create an illusion of space without fiddling with the fabric of the building; plus a swift guide to imaginative bodging with cheap materials (such as decorating power sockets with gold or silver paint). </p> <p>Personally, I liked the idea of hiding an iMac in a paint-treated Ikea wardrobe (\"the cheapest one they had\"). Ditto the little loo with its peacock feather throne, Arabic flooring and wrapping-paper decor. The bathroom? No, that particular bit of Lewis alchemy is pure theatre, a bit of entertainment - and though you might want to applaud it as such, perhaps it's best left at home where it belongs.</p> <p>\u0095 Brian Lewis's home is open today and tomorrow, from 1-5pm, at 1st Floor, 155 Holland Park Avenue, London W11.

True, he gagged on the latter wine (it was German, see below), but then this was entirely predictable. What was not was that I would be able to find such wines; wines that would contradict his assertion that it was impossible to create drinkable white wines for this kind of money. I also threw in a more expensive white and a couple of interesting reds, since they also stood to prove that British retailers possess a unique nose for bargains. </p> <p>Asda's wine department has needed no lessons from its new masters, Wal-Mart, about pricing, which is why this retailer is breathing hard on Sainsbury's heels and is even giving Tesco something to think about.</p> <p>Chardonnay Jardin de la France 1999 (14 points out of 20, \u00a33.23) is admittedly light, but this is due to the genteel nature of the fruit, which recalls under-ripe ogen melon, rather than a shortness of finish, for it ends refreshingly and crisply.

Badger Hill Hungarian Sauvignon 1999 (14 points, \u00a32.99) is very herbaceous and crisp, good with fish cakes and crustacea, and finishes impactfully and dryly.</p> <p>Asda Cape Chardonnay 1999 (15.5 points, \u00a33.47) is also a food wine - for anything from tuna salad to roast chicken. It has considerable fulsomeness, an urgency to please, and depth on the finish. Last at Asda (and widely elsewhere), there is the Spanish stalwart non- vintage red, Don Darias, which in its latest blend rates 15.5 points. This \u00a33.49 wine has decent tannins and some real character to its well-developed fruit. </p> <p>Morrisons' prices match anyone's, so if there isn't a convenient Asda near you, there might well be a Morrisons, especially now that - after decades of staunch northern residency - this retailer is suddenly popping up all over the place.

I included this wine in my selection even though it costs \u00a34.99, for it demonstrates that it is possible to find mature American white wine of genuine character for less than a fiver. </p> <p>On Morrisons' red shelves, Vina Albali Tempranillo 1999 (15.5 points, \u00a33.45), from Spain, is slightly creamy, very subtly vanillary and has assertive tannins. This is an excellent roast meat or savoury vegetable casserole wine. I had to include Fairview Malbec 1999, from South Africa, in spite of its \u00a35.99 price tag, simply because it is so 16.5-point marvellous.

Also at this enterprising retailer (where wine is concerned) is Chteau Valoussi\u00e8re Cteaux de Languedoc 1997 (16.5 points, \u00a34.49), which has gorgeous spices and tannins combined with balanced fruit and acids.

      "body": "<p>It would be foolish to underestimate the effort Bob Dylan has put into making himself rock music's greatest enigma. Rarely granting interviews, he also uses his influence to dissuade others from spilling any beans about him. \"Bob really doesn't like people he knows to talk about his life,\" admitted Roger McGuinn, whose performances of Dylan's songs with The Byrds in the 60s were crucial in helping Dylan break through to a popular audience. When Dylan's current manager, Jeff Rosen, is approached for a few comments, he replies that not only will he not talk, he would prefer it if his name isn't even mentioned. He is just a \"functionary\", he explains, who \"helps out with things\". Neil Young's manager, Elliot Roberts, has known Dylan for decades, but he wouldn't comment either. \"I know Bob pretty well,\" he agreed, \"but I know that if I talk to you about him, I won't know him well any more.\" </p> <p>Dylan once went some way to explaining himself to Jann Wenner of Rolling Stone magazine. \"People don't understand that the press just use you to sell papers,\" he reflected. \"They misquote you all the time. It hurts because you think you were just played for a fool. And the more hurts you get, the less you want to do it.\" </p> <p>Yet Dylan's furtiveness seems to have gone beyond mere media-wariness and evolved into a Great Game worthy of a John le Carr\u00e9 espionage novel. Now that Dylan no longer commands the cultural high ground he dominated in his heyday, he will at least spin out his lingering mystique for all it's worth. Therefore the Bob Dylan currently touring Britain and Europe will not be going out of his way to explain his methods or his motivation, but he will doubtless feel reassured that the pendulum of public sympathy has recently swung back towards him. </p> <p>At the end of the 80s, Dylan's career had reached its nadir. Having driven away his audience in droves with his bewildering born-again Christian period, he had moved on to discs like Knocked Out Loaded and Down In The Groove, which seemed pointlessly removed from either a contempo rary audience or fans of the classic Dylan of 20-odd years earlier. His appearance as a grizzled rock'n'roll veteran in the 1986 movie Hearts Of Fire looked like grotesque self-parody, almost as much as his membership of the Travelin' Wilburys, a wretched project featuring a bunch of senior citizens playing a Saga Holidays pastiche of country-rock. It seemed that the bones of Dylan's legacy had been left lying in the dust for rock historians to squabble over. </p> <p>But what a difference a decade can make. Dylan rang in the new millennium with the song Things Have Changed, from the soundtrack of the Michael Douglas movie, Wonder Boys. The song's sly delivery and mordant surrealism stirred memories of a younger, hipper Dylan. In the accompanying video, dressed in a frock coat and straw boater and carrying a gold-topped cane, he put on a wry display of long-suffering bemusement, as if to say \"I may be a genius, but look what I have to put up with.\" Then, last May 15, he was presented with the Polar Music Prize in Stockholm, an honour he shares with the likes of Stevie Wonder, Bruce Springsteen, Joni Mitchell and the classical violinist Isaac Stern. </p> <p>If one single event could be identified as triggering the refurbishment of Dylan's fading reputation, it was his 1997 album, Time Out Of Mind. A haunted collection of blues, rockabilly and ballads apparently reaching out from beyond the grave, it confirmed that he hadn't, after all, lost the ability to hypnotise his listeners, nor to mine an indefinable sense of spiritual profundity from the simplest of musical tools. The record touched people like nothing he'd released in years. </p> <p>Greil Marcus, that most professorial of rock critics who has made a continuing study of Dylan's work, taught a class at Berkeley called Prophecy in the American Voice, in which he invited his students to discuss Dylan's three most recent albums along with the evangelical speeches he had delivered from various concert stages during his born-again phase in the 1980s. \"The students were absolutely enthralled by Time Out Of Mind,\" Marcus recalls. \"They found it disturbing, mysterious, threatening, a little scary and utterly fascinating.\" </p> <p>It seemed to Marcus's class that the album represented a delayed reaction to Dylan's evangelical period and whatever spiritual crisis had precipitated it. \"They heard it as a record of abandonment,\" Marcus continues. \"They said 'this is not about being abandoned by some woman. This record is about being abandoned by God, and it's really for the first time since this event coming to terms with rage and sorrow'. It was not something that I would ever have thought of, that that was how Time Out Of Mind works, but it seems a tremendously rich way of hearing it.\" </p> <p>The fact that the disc could stimulate such a complex response might offer an answer to the question whether, 40 years after Dylan first travelled from Hibbing, Minnesota to New York, at the start of his long trail from folk singer to rock's greatest conundrum, his work can matter to listeners who weren't brought up listening to him either first hand or via parents or siblings. Not that Dylan seems to be holding his breath. \"I can't say that it's never been my turn commercially, and that I've never known the feeling of having a record top the charts, because it wouldn't be true,\" he said, after the release of Time Out Of Mind. \"But to have it again? I'm not really counting on it, 'cos I don't want to set myself up for a disappointment.\" </p> <p>Greil Marcus cautions that \"he doesn't necessarily mean anything to somebody younger, and there's no reason that he should if he's not able to seduce them now. That doesn't necessarily mean seducing them with new music. Somebody could bump into The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan [from 1963] and fall down the rabbit hole of his career that way.\" </p> <p>It was this earliest incarnation of Dylan that Marcus first happened upon, when he went to see Joan Baez playing a folk concert in a field in New Jersey in 1963. \"About halfway through she said I have a friend here I'd like to bring out, and this scruffy, dusty-looking character comes out with his shoulders kind of hunched. He sang a couple of songs with her and a couple of songs by himself, and then he left. That was the last time I was ever interested in Joan Baez. I'd never heard of him and I didn't quite get his name right, but I was at the record store the next day looking for something by him. There was a twisted labyrinth of possibility in that voice that I'd never encountered before, and I was just instantly captivated by him.\" </p> <p>The Dylan that Marcus saw that day was a man ablaze with self-transforming ambition, in transit between the hobo ballads and dustbowl songs with which he first made an impression and the protest songwriter about to rewrite the rules of American folk music. Yet Dylan might have been a rock'n'roller from the very start, had he pursued the early enthusiasm for Little Richard-style piano thumping he displayed in Hibbing school bands like the Golden Chords and Elston Gunn &amp; the Rock Boppers. In his 1959 high school yearbook, Dylan claimed his ambition was to \"join the band of Little Richard\". </p> <p>He was born Robert Allen Zimmerman on May 24 1941 in Duluth, Minnesota. When he was six he moved with his parents to Hibbing, near the Canadian border. Robert and his brother David were the only children of Abe and Beatty Zimmerman, and their father was the proprietor of an electrical and furniture store. There was a primitivism about the wilds of northern Minnesota which stamped itself in Bob's imagination. \"Every once in while a wagon would come through town with a gorilla in a cage or, I remember, a mummy under glass,\" Dylan reminisced. \"It was a very itinerant place - no interstate highways yet, just country roads everywhere.There was an innocence about it all, and I don't recall anything bad ever happening.\" </p> <p>But if the adult Dylan recalls Hibbing as a rural idyll, his teenage self was desperate to escape to the big city. He enrolled at the university of Minnesota in Minneapolis in 1959, though he focused on the blues and folk music in the local beatnik bars rather than on academic subjects. He changed his name to Dylan - believed by some to be a homage to the Welsh poet Dylan Thomas - and began to work up his own folk-singer act, but it was on a trip to Denver in 1960 that his ambitions began to crystallise. He began consciously to model himself on the protest singer Woody Guthrie, learning Guthrie's songs and even imitating his Oklahoma accent. Certain that he wanted to pursue a musical career, Dylan set off for New York where he arrived in January 1961. </p> <p>His vagabond image and apparently \"authentic\" rural whine made an instant impact on the seething folk circuit in Greenwich Village. He seized every opportunity to embroider his personal mystique, exhibiting a rare gift for self-mythology as he spun out a skein of tall tales about his family and background. He claimed he had run away to a travelling carnival when he was 13, denied he'd ever been called Zimmerman, and professed to have studied with an assortment of obscure blues and folk singers. He presented his arrival in New York as partly a pilgrimage to visit the dying and bedridden Woody Guthrie. </p> <p>Dylan's self-penned new identity was good enough to fool the experts. The folk singer Ramblin' Jack Elliot, another composer from whom he had borrowed liberally, commented that \"there was not another sonofabitch in the country that could sing until Bob Dylan came along. Everybody else was singing like a damned faggot.\" In a pivotal New York Times review, Robert Shelton waxed euphoric about how Dylan evoked \"the rude beauty of a Southern field hand musing in melody on his porch\". The review was spotted by talent-scout John Hammond, who signed him to Columbia Records in autumn 1961. </p> <p>With hindsight, Dylan's protest-singer period seems no more than a blip in his long career, but between 1962 and 1964 he became the patron saint of the Civil Rights movement. Songs like Blowin' In The Wind and The Times They Are A-Changin' mirrored the passion for social justice that was sweeping contemporary American youth, and are still among his best known. Yet it seems that Bob already foresaw an electric future, since as early as 1962 he recorded Mixed Up Confusion with a rock'n'roll backing. Some suspect that it was his brilliantly machiavellian manager, Albert Grossman, who grasped that Dylan's immediate future lay in the folk-protest sphere, and Confusion was hastily deleted. </p> <p>Dylan's public conversion to amplifiers and electricity has become an essential bullet-point in any potted history of rock. It is frequently claimed that his performance with an electric band at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival was booed and jeered by the folk diehards, but Al Kooper, Dylan's organist on that occasion, says it wasn't like that at all. Like A Rolling Stone was already a radio hit, and the crowd booed because they wanted more of the rocking Dylan, not less. \"Damn right, they booed,\" Kooper recalled. \"But not at Bob - rather, at whoever was seemingly responsible for yanking him offstage after 15 minutes.\" Kooper, who bluffed his way into playing the Hammond organ during recording sessions for Highway 61 Revisited and almost inadvertently helped create what Dylan would call his \"wild mercury\" sound, described Bob's pivotal influence at his mid-60s peak. \"In 1965, sessions for Dylan albumsmight as well have been strategy meetings for the direction the new alternative culture would take.\" </p> <p>For all Dylan's brilliance at exploiting the way musical and social trends were shifting, he wouldn't have been able to make his crossover into rock without listeners eager to go with him. In the same way that he had been thrilled by such musical experiments as The Animals' rock version of House Of The Rising Sun and The Beatles' continuing advances in songwriting and use of studio technology, a wider audience was urging the musicians to take more risks. \"It was obvious to me that The Beatles had staying power,\" Dylan commented. \"I knew they were pointing the direction of where music had to go.\" </p> <p>He benefited hugely from Albert Grossman's support. \"The only person who was as indecipherable as Grossman was Dylan - and their closeness and similarities led to a great deal of speculation within both the music business and the folk community about who had invented whom,\" wrote Fred Goodman in his book The Mansion On The Hill. \"The reality was that they were unusually well-matched soul mates.\" </p> <p>Grossman parlayed Dylan's creative genius into awesome commercial clout. Grossman was the first rock manager to realise how desperately record companies needed creative artists in that era of dawning youth consciousness, and he used that leverage to cut deals giving his acts unprecedented earnings and artistic control. Meanwhile, he was shrewd enough to see the benefit of having Peter Paul &amp; Mary, also from his management stable, sing a sugary, chartbusting version of Blowin' In The Wind to boost Dylan's commercial profile. </p> <p>Dylan and Grossman severed their professional relationship in 1970, but the superman of folk-rock has regularly relied on third-party assistance as a catalyst for his strongest work. At different times, The Band and Tom Petty's Heartbreakers gave him a scope and discipline which allowed his music to thrive, while producer Daniel Lanois has been at the helm of his best recent albums, Oh Mercy and Time Out Of Mind. </p> <p>\"He gets people to kill themselves for him, and that's a mark of a certain kind of talent,\" comments Donn Pennebaker, who saw the Dylan operation from the inside when he made his 1965 tour documentary, Don't Look Back. \"But I think it frustrates Dylan sometimes. He gets people around him, like The Band, and then he has to run away from it because it's pinning him down. He has to keep being Dylan, which he doesn't want to do. He wants to be something more ephemeral.\" </p> <p>Dylan's power to play with image and identity can still mesmerise other performers, even if he no longer inspires the massed legions of impersonators that erupted in his wake during the 60s and 70s, when everybody from David Bowie to Bruce Springsteen and Patti Smith was hailed as a New Dylan. One contemporary artist captivated by the myth and magic of Bob is Tim Burgess of The Charlatans, whose own songs feature the occasional sly quote from the bard of Minnesota. As Burgess sees it, Dylan's process of perpetual reinvention has never stopped, whether he happens to be in or out of fashion. \"I love Time Out Of Mind, because for the third or fourth time in his career he's found a new voice. I think maybe a few LPs before that one he was discovering something but hadn't quite got there. Then with Time Out Of Mind he's right on the button with his new voice and his new image. I think he did it with Nashville Skyline in the late 60s, then again with Blood On The Tracks, and again with Oh Mercy. It's like decades apart, but he's got a new voice and I think that's incredible.\" </p> <p>Critics habitually forget that it's a fatal mistake to identify Dylan with the characters and circumstances portrayed in his songs, and that the purpose of art isn't merely to clone experience, but to transform it. With 1975's Blood On The Tracks, the anguish of the breakup of his marriage to the former model Sara Lowndes pushed Dylan to fashion a set of songs which amounted to a philosophical re-imagining of his whole life, portraying it as a kind of mythic quest signposted with symbols and riddled with ironies. His poetic distillation of love, memory, coincidence and fate was as close as rock music has come to great literature. </p> <p>\"I don't listen or read or watch movies looking for any kind of autobiographical subtext,\" Greil Marcus points out. \"Art to me is about something that is imagined. It's a world that does not really exist that you're allowed to enter. To me, whether or not Dylan is creating a persona, I'm hearing one.\" </p> <p>Marcus has been particularly absorbed by the music Dylan made during 1967 at a hideaway in upstate New York. Following his conquest of rock'n'roll Everest with the brilliant trio of albums which culminated with Blonde On Blonde, and a drug-fuelled schedule of international touring, Dylan had retreated into the countryside near Woodstock with his wife Sara. A motorcycle accident in July 1966 left him with concussion and some cracked vertebrae, and during his recuperation, Dylan realised how urgently he needed to change his both-ends-burning lifestyle. \"I thought I was just gonna get up and go back to doing what I was doing before,\" he said later, \"but I couldn't do it any more.\" </p> <p>He had married Sara Shirley Lowndes in New York in November 1965, apparently captivated by her aura of spiritual calm and aloofness from the nightclubbing crowd he hung out with. The Dylans hurled themselves into domesticity and parenthood. Jesse was born shortly before the motorcycle crash, joining Maria, Sara's daughter by her previous marriage. By 1969, Anna, Sam and Jakob had swelled the Dylan clan. It would seem to Dylan's bewildered fans that private contentment had fatally diminished Bob's artistic drive, since this was the period when he would produce Nashville Skyline and Self Portrait, albums which seemed almost parodies of the settled, rural life the Dylans were leading. According to journalist Al Aronowitz: \"Bob and Sara grew to be one of the tightest twosomes I've ever known. In the years following his motorcycle accident, Bob acted like a romantic cornball when he was with her.\" </p> <p> However, even as Dylan grew a beard and threatened to turn into a beatnik Bing Crosby, he still found time during 1967 to make the Basement Tapes, a sprawling array of songs recorded in a rented house with The Band. They caught him exploring a range of folk, blues and country styles. Turning away from the technical and stylistic advances which were expected from rock music at the time (typified by the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds or The Beatles' Sgt Pepper), he had immersed himself in a timeless well of traditional American songwriting. \"He would pull these songs out of nowhere,\" said Robbie Robertson, The Band's guitarist. \"We didn't know if he wrote them or if he remembered them. When he sang them, you couldn't tell.\" </p> <p>In its way, Dylan's retreat into traditional musical forms was as much a signpost of the times as his earlier groundbreaking accomplishments. With Dylan's sanction, rock bands like the Flying Burrito Brothers, Crosby Stills &amp; Nash and The Eagles suddenly felt they had permission to play airy, melodic country rock. Throughout the 70s, as the hangover from the 60s set in, vocal harmonies and pedal steel guitars became strangely reassuring after years of screaming psychedelic guitars and acid-rock rambling. </p> <p>With hindsight, it's remarkable how Dylan's influence pervaded even projects in which he ostensibly had no involvement, as if nobody dared make a move without Bob's tacit approval. When Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper were making their breakthrough counterculture movie Easy Rider in 1969, they wanted Dylan to contribute to the soundtrack. But it was Roger McGuinn who wrote and sang The Ballad Of Easy Rider for the film. </p> <p>\"Peter Fonda wanted a song written for the movie, so he took it to New York and screened it for Bob,\" McGuinn says.\" Dylan wrote some notes on a cocktail napkin, handed it to Peter and said 'Give this to McGuinn, he'll know what to do with it'. I got the napkin, wrote the melody and finished up the lyrics. When the song came out, I gave Bob a 50% writer's credit, but he called me and asked me to take it off. He said he didn't need the money.\" </p> <p>Over subsequent decades, Dylan's power to influence mass popular movements has inevitably waned, even though his throwaway remark from the stage at Live Aid led directly to the formation of Farm Aid to benefit struggling American farmers. Depressingly, he has often resembled a derelict figure stumbling through mediocre concerts and churning out records in which he palpably has no interest, while what we can glean of his private life confirms the notion of a rootless loner doomed never to recapture the sense of belonging that his marriage to Sara once afforded him. </p> <p>Since his divorce in 1977, a string of lovers has drifted in and out of his various homes in Malibu, Minnesota and New York, among the more conspicuous being Columbia Records executive Ellen Bernstein, gospel singer Clydie King, actresses Mary Alice Artes and Sally Kirkland, estate agent Britta Lee Shain and a French painter named Claude-Angele Boni. In 1994, Ruth Tyrangiel served Dylan with a $5m \"palimony\" suit, claiming that they had lived virtually as husband and wife for 17 years, but Dylan settled privately for a much-reduced sum. </p> <p>In 1997, his paranoia about publicity must have soared off the dial when news leaked out of a proposed kiss-and-tell memoir - so far unpublished - by yet another ex-girlfriend, Susan Ross. This would depict him, allegedly, as a creatively bankrupt drinker, and even contain details of \"secret marriages\" and consequent offspring. It seems that Dylan may have married his erstwhile backing singer Carolyn Dennis in 1980 and fathered two children with her, but he has managed to sustain a total news blackout on the issue. </p> <p>Yet whatever personal chaos may teem behind the Dylan legend, nothing can tarnish the grandeur of his reputation as the great folk-rock-poet from the 60s. The world has fixed for all time what it wants him to stand for. Wherever he goes, regardless of how dismal his previous couple of albums may have been, civic dignitaries or august panels of his peers are eager to heap fresh honours on him. In 1982, he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame (\"this is pretty amazing because I can't read or write a note of music,\" he confessed). In 1989, Springsteen inducted him into the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame, asserting that Dylan \"had the vision and the talent to make a pop song that contained the whole world\". </p> <p>In 1990 Jack Lang, the French culture minister, made him a Commandeur de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in Paris. In 1991, he was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 33rd Grammy Awards. In 1992, a parade of illustrious rock'n'roll dignitaries turned out for the Bob Dylan 30th anniversary celebration concert at New York's Madison Square Garden.

Rarely granting interviews, he also uses his influence to dissuade others from spilling any beans about him. \"Bob really doesn't like people he knows to talk about his life,\" admitted Roger McGuinn, whose performances of Dylan's songs with The Byrds in the 60s were crucial in helping Dylan break through to a popular audience. When Dylan's current manager, Jeff Rosen, is approached for a few comments, he replies that not only will he not talk, he would prefer it if his name isn't even mentioned. He is just a \"functionary\", he explains, who \"helps out with things\". Neil Young's manager, Elliot Roberts, has known Dylan for decades, but he wouldn't comment either. \"I know Bob pretty well,\" he agreed, \"but I know that if I talk to you about him, I won't know him well any more.\" Dylan once went some way to explaining himself to Jann Wenner of Rolling Stone magazine. \"People don't understand that the press just use you to sell papers,\" he reflected. \"They misquote you all the time. It hurts because you think you were just played for a fool. And the more hurts you get, the less you want to do it.\" Yet Dylan's furtiveness seems to have gone beyond mere media-wariness and evolved into a Great Game worthy of a John le Carr\u00e9 espionage novel. Now that Dylan no longer commands the cultural high ground he dominated in his heyday, he will at least spin out his lingering mystique for all it's worth. Therefore the Bob Dylan currently touring Britain and Europe will not be going out of his way to explain his methods or his motivation, but he will doubtless feel reassured that the pendulum of public sympathy has recently swung back towards him. At the end of the 80s, Dylan's career had reached its nadir. Having driven away his audience in droves with his bewildering born-again Christian period, he had moved on to discs like Knocked Out Loaded and Down In The Groove, which seemed pointlessly removed from either a contempo rary audience or fans of the classic Dylan of 20-odd years earlier. His appearance as a grizzled rock'n'roll veteran in the 1986 movie Hearts Of Fire looked like grotesque self-parody, almost as much as his membership of the Travelin' Wilburys, a wretched project featuring a bunch of senior citizens playing a Saga Holidays pastiche of country-rock. It seemed that the bones of Dylan's legacy had been left lying in the dust for rock historians to squabble over. But what a difference a decade can make. Dylan rang in the new millennium with the song Things Have Changed, from the soundtrack of the Michael Douglas movie, Wonder Boys. The song's sly delivery and mordant surrealism stirred memories of a younger, hipper Dylan. In the accompanying video, dressed in a frock coat and straw boater and carrying a gold-topped cane, he put on a wry display of long-suffering bemusement, as if to say \"I may be a genius, but look what I have to put up with.\" Then, last May 15, he was presented with the Polar Music Prize in Stockholm, an honour he shares with the likes of Stevie Wonder, Bruce Springsteen, Joni Mitchell and the classical violinist Isaac Stern. If one single event could be identified as triggering the refurbishment of Dylan's fading reputation, it was his 1997 album, Time Out Of Mind. A haunted collection of blues, rockabilly and ballads apparently reaching out from beyond the grave, it confirmed that he hadn't, after all, lost the ability to hypnotise his listeners, nor to mine an indefinable sense of spiritual profundity from the simplest of musical tools. The record touched people like nothing he'd released in years. Greil Marcus, that most professorial of rock critics who has made a continuing study of Dylan's work, taught a class at Berkeley called Prophecy in the American Voice, in which he invited his students to discuss Dylan's three most recent albums along with the evangelical speeches he had delivered from various concert stages during his born-again phase in the 1980s. \"The students were absolutely enthralled by Time Out Of Mind,\" Marcus recalls. \"They found it disturbing, mysterious, threatening, a little scary and utterly fascinating.\" It seemed to Marcus's class that the album represented a delayed reaction to Dylan's evangelical period and whatever spiritual crisis had precipitated it. \"They heard it as a record of abandonment,\" Marcus continues. \"They said 'this is not about being abandoned by some woman. This record is about being abandoned by God, and it's really for the first time since this event coming to terms with rage and sorrow'. It was not something that I would ever have thought of, that that was how Time Out Of Mind works, but it seems a tremendously rich way of hearing it.\" The fact that the disc could stimulate such a complex response might offer an answer to the question whether, 40 years after Dylan first travelled from Hibbing, Minnesota to New York, at the start of his long trail from folk singer to rock's greatest conundrum, his work can matter to listeners who weren't brought up listening to him either first hand or via parents or siblings. Not that Dylan seems to be holding his breath. \"I can't say that it's never been my turn commercially, and that I've never known the feeling of having a record top the charts, because it wouldn't be true,\" he said, after the release of Time Out Of Mind. \"But to have it again? I'm not really counting on it, 'cos I don't want to set myself up for a disappointment.\" Greil Marcus cautions that \"he doesn't necessarily mean anything to somebody younger, and there's no reason that he should if he's not able to seduce them now. That doesn't necessarily mean seducing them with new music. Somebody could bump into The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan [from 1963] and fall down the rabbit hole of his career that way.\" It was this earliest incarnation of Dylan that Marcus first happened upon, when he went to see Joan Baez playing a folk concert in a field in New Jersey in 1963. \"About halfway through she said I have a friend here I'd like to bring out, and this scruffy, dusty-looking character comes out with his shoulders kind of hunched. He sang a couple of songs with her and a couple of songs by himself, and then he left. That was the last time I was ever interested in Joan Baez. I'd never heard of him and I didn't quite get his name right, but I was at the record store the next day looking for something by him. There was a twisted labyrinth of possibility in that voice that I'd never encountered before, and I was just instantly captivated by him.\" The Dylan that Marcus saw that day was a man ablaze with self-transforming ambition, in transit between the hobo ballads and dustbowl songs with which he first made an impression and the protest songwriter about to rewrite the rules of American folk music. Yet Dylan might have been a rock'n'roller from the very start, had he pursued the early enthusiasm for Little Richard-style piano thumping he displayed in Hibbing school bands like the Golden Chords and Elston Gunn &amp; the Rock Boppers. In his 1959 high school yearbook, Dylan claimed his ambition was to \"join the band of Little Richard\". He was born Robert Allen Zimmerman on May 24 1941 in Duluth, Minnesota. When he was six he moved with his parents to Hibbing, near the Canadian border. Robert and his brother David were the only children of Abe and Beatty Zimmerman, and their father was the proprietor of an electrical and furniture store. There was a primitivism about the wilds of northern Minnesota which stamped itself in Bob's imagination. \"Every once in while a wagon would come through town with a gorilla in a cage or, I remember, a mummy under glass,\" Dylan reminisced. \"It was a very itinerant place - no interstate highways yet, just country roads everywhere.There was an innocence about it all, and I don't recall anything bad ever happening.\" But if the adult Dylan recalls Hibbing as a rural idyll, his teenage self was desperate to escape to the big city. He enrolled at the university of Minnesota in Minneapolis in 1959, though he focused on the blues and folk music in the local beatnik bars rather than on academic subjects. He changed his name to Dylan - believed by some to be a homage to the Welsh poet Dylan Thomas - and began to work up his own folk-singer act, but it was on a trip to Denver in 1960 that his ambitions began to crystallise. He began consciously to model himself on the protest singer Woody Guthrie, learning Guthrie's songs and even imitating his Oklahoma accent. Certain that he wanted to pursue a musical career, Dylan set off for New York where he arrived in January 1961. His vagabond image and apparently \"authentic\" rural whine made an instant impact on the seething folk circuit in Greenwich Village. He seized every opportunity to embroider his personal mystique, exhibiting a rare gift for self-mythology as he spun out a skein of tall tales about his family and background. He claimed he had run away to a travelling carnival when he was 13, denied he'd ever been called Zimmerman, and professed to have studied with an assortment of obscure blues and folk singers. He presented his arrival in New York as partly a pilgrimage to visit the dying and bedridden Woody Guthrie. Dylan's self-penned new identity was good enough to fool the experts. The folk singer Ramblin' Jack Elliot, another composer from whom he had borrowed liberally, commented that \"there was not another sonofabitch in the country that could sing until Bob Dylan came along. Everybody else was singing like a damned faggot.\" In a pivotal New York Times review, Robert Shelton waxed euphoric about how Dylan evoked \"the rude beauty of a Southern field hand musing in melody on his porch\". The review was spotted by talent-scout John Hammond, who signed him to Columbia Records in autumn 1961. With hindsight, Dylan's protest-singer period seems no more than a blip in his long career, but between 1962 and 1964 he became the patron saint of the Civil Rights movement. Songs like Blowin' In The Wind and The Times They Are A-Changin' mirrored the passion for social justice that was sweeping contemporary American youth, and are still among his best known. Yet it seems that Bob already foresaw an electric future, since as early as 1962 he recorded Mixed Up Confusion with a rock'n'roll backing. Some suspect that it was his brilliantly machiavellian manager, Albert Grossman, who grasped that Dylan's immediate future lay in the folk-protest sphere, and Confusion was hastily deleted. Dylan's public conversion to amplifiers and electricity has become an essential bullet-point in any potted history of rock. It is frequently claimed that his performance with an electric band at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival was booed and jeered by the folk diehards, but Al Kooper, Dylan's organist on that occasion, says it wasn't like that at all. Like A Rolling Stone was already a radio hit, and the crowd booed because they wanted more of the rocking Dylan, not less. \"Damn right, they booed,\" Kooper recalled. \"But not at Bob - rather, at whoever was seemingly responsible for yanking him offstage after 15 minutes.\" Kooper, who bluffed his way into playing the Hammond organ during recording sessions for Highway 61 Revisited and almost inadvertently helped create what Dylan would call his \"wild mercury\" sound, described Bob's pivotal influence at his mid-60s peak. \"In 1965, sessions for Dylan albumsmight as well have been strategy meetings for the direction the new alternative culture would take.\" For all Dylan's brilliance at exploiting the way musical and social trends were shifting, he wouldn't have been able to make his crossover into rock without listeners eager to go with him. In the same way that he had been thrilled by such musical experiments as The Animals' rock version of House Of The Rising Sun and The Beatles' continuing advances in songwriting and use of studio technology, a wider audience was urging the musicians to take more risks. \"It was obvious to me that The Beatles had staying power,\" Dylan commented. \"I knew they were pointing the direction of where music had to go.\" He benefited hugely from Albert Grossman's support. \"The only person who was as indecipherable as Grossman was Dylan - and their closeness and similarities led to a great deal of speculation within both the music business and the folk community about who had invented whom,\" wrote Fred Goodman in his book The Mansion On The Hill. \"The reality was that they were unusually well-matched soul mates.\" Grossman parlayed Dylan's creative genius into awesome commercial clout. Grossman was the first rock manager to realise how desperately record companies needed creative artists in that era of dawning youth consciousness, and he used that leverage to cut deals giving his acts unprecedented earnings and artistic control. Meanwhile, he was shrewd enough to see the benefit of having Peter Paul &amp; Mary, also from his management stable, sing a sugary, chartbusting version of Blowin' In The Wind to boost Dylan's commercial profile. Dylan and Grossman severed their professional relationship in 1970, but the superman of folk-rock has regularly relied on third-party assistance as a catalyst for his strongest work. At different times, The Band and Tom Petty's Heartbreakers gave him a scope and discipline which allowed his music to thrive, while producer Daniel Lanois has been at the helm of his best recent albums, Oh Mercy and Time Out Of Mind. \"He gets people to kill themselves for him, and that's a mark of a certain kind of talent,\" comments Donn Pennebaker, who saw the Dylan operation from the inside when he made his 1965 tour documentary, Don't Look Back. \"But I think it frustrates Dylan sometimes. He gets people around him, like The Band, and then he has to run away from it because it's pinning him down. He has to keep being Dylan, which he doesn't want to do. He wants to be something more ephemeral.\" Dylan's power to play with image and identity can still mesmerise other performers, even if he no longer inspires the massed legions of impersonators that erupted in his wake during the 60s and 70s, when everybody from David Bowie to Bruce Springsteen and Patti Smith was hailed as a New Dylan. One contemporary artist captivated by the myth and magic of Bob is Tim Burgess of The Charlatans, whose own songs feature the occasional sly quote from the bard of Minnesota. As Burgess sees it, Dylan's process of perpetual reinvention has never stopped, whether he happens to be in or out of fashion. \"I love Time Out Of Mind, because for the third or fourth time in his career he's found a new voice. I think maybe a few LPs before that one he was discovering something but hadn't quite got there. Then with Time Out Of Mind he's right on the button with his new voice and his new image. I think he did it with Nashville Skyline in the late 60s, then again with Blood On The Tracks, and again with Oh Mercy. It's like decades apart, but he's got a new voice and I think that's incredible.\" Critics habitually forget that it's a fatal mistake to identify Dylan with the characters and circumstances portrayed in his songs, and that the purpose of art isn't merely to clone experience, but to transform it. With 1975's Blood On The Tracks, the anguish of the breakup of his marriage to the former model Sara Lowndes pushed Dylan to fashion a set of songs which amounted to a philosophical re-imagining of his whole life, portraying it as a kind of mythic quest signposted with symbols and riddled with ironies. His poetic distillation of love, memory, coincidence and fate was as close as rock music has come to great literature. \"I don't listen or read or watch movies looking for any kind of autobiographical subtext,\" Greil Marcus points out. \"Art to me is about something that is imagined. It's a world that does not really exist that you're allowed to enter. To me, whether or not Dylan is creating a persona, I'm hearing one.\" Marcus has been particularly absorbed by the music Dylan made during 1967 at a hideaway in upstate New York. Following his conquest of rock'n'roll Everest with the brilliant trio of albums which culminated with Blonde On Blonde, and a drug-fuelled schedule of international touring, Dylan had retreated into the countryside near Woodstock with his wife Sara. A motorcycle accident in July 1966 left him with concussion and some cracked vertebrae, and during his recuperation, Dylan realised how urgently he needed to change his both-ends-burning lifestyle. \"I thought I was just gonna get up and go back to doing what I was doing before,\" he said later, \"but I couldn't do it any more.\" He had married Sara Shirley Lowndes in New York in November 1965, apparently captivated by her aura of spiritual calm and aloofness from the nightclubbing crowd he hung out with. The Dylans hurled themselves into domesticity and parenthood. Jesse was born shortly before the motorcycle crash, joining Maria, Sara's daughter by her previous marriage. By 1969, Anna, Sam and Jakob had swelled the Dylan clan. It would seem to Dylan's bewildered fans that private contentment had fatally diminished Bob's artistic drive, since this was the period when he would produce Nashville Skyline and Self Portrait, albums which seemed almost parodies of the settled, rural life the Dylans were leading. According to journalist Al Aronowitz: \"Bob and Sara grew to be one of the tightest twosomes I've ever known. In the years following his motorcycle accident, Bob acted like a romantic cornball when he was with her.\" However, even as Dylan grew a beard and threatened to turn into a beatnik Bing Crosby, he still found time during 1967 to make the Basement Tapes, a sprawling array of songs recorded in a rented house with The Band. They caught him exploring a range of folk, blues and country styles. Turning away from the technical and stylistic advances which were expected from rock music at the time (typified by the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds or The Beatles' Sgt Pepper), he had immersed himself in a timeless well of traditional American songwriting. \"He would pull these songs out of nowhere,\" said Robbie Robertson, The Band's guitarist. \"We didn't know if he wrote them or if he remembered them. When he sang them, you couldn't tell.\" In its way, Dylan's retreat into traditional musical forms was as much a signpost of the times as his earlier groundbreaking accomplishments. With Dylan's sanction, rock bands like the Flying Burrito Brothers, Crosby Stills &amp; Nash and The Eagles suddenly felt they had permission to play airy, melodic country rock. Throughout the 70s, as the hangover from the 60s set in, vocal harmonies and pedal steel guitars became strangely reassuring after years of screaming psychedelic guitars and acid-rock rambling. With hindsight, it's remarkable how Dylan's influence pervaded even projects in which he ostensibly had no involvement, as if nobody dared make a move without Bob's tacit approval. When Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper were making their breakthrough counterculture movie Easy Rider in 1969, they wanted Dylan to contribute to the soundtrack. But it was Roger McGuinn who wrote and sang The Ballad Of Easy Rider for the film. \"Peter Fonda wanted a song written for the movie, so he took it to New York and screened it for Bob,\" McGuinn says.\" Dylan wrote some notes on a cocktail napkin, handed it to Peter and said 'Give this to McGuinn, he'll know what to do with it'. I got the napkin, wrote the melody and finished up the lyrics. When the song came out, I gave Bob a 50% writer's credit, but he called me and asked me to take it off. He said he didn't need the money.\" Over subsequent decades, Dylan's power to influence mass popular movements has inevitably waned, even though his throwaway remark from the stage at Live Aid led directly to the formation of Farm Aid to benefit struggling American farmers. Depressingly, he has often resembled a derelict figure stumbling through mediocre concerts and churning out records in which he palpably has no interest, while what we can glean of his private life confirms the notion of a rootless loner doomed never to recapture the sense of belonging that his marriage to Sara once afforded him. Since his divorce in 1977, a string of lovers has drifted in and out of his various homes in Malibu, Minnesota and New York, among the more conspicuous being Columbia Records executive Ellen Bernstein, gospel singer Clydie King, actresses Mary Alice Artes and Sally Kirkland, estate agent Britta Lee Shain and a French painter named Claude-Angele Boni. In 1994, Ruth Tyrangiel served Dylan with a $5m \"palimony\" suit, claiming that they had lived virtually as husband and wife for 17 years, but Dylan settled privately for a much-reduced sum. In 1997, his paranoia about publicity must have soared off the dial when news leaked out of a proposed kiss-and-tell memoir - so far unpublished - by yet another ex-girlfriend, Susan Ross. This would depict him, allegedly, as a creatively bankrupt drinker, and even contain details of \"secret marriages\" and consequent offspring. It seems that Dylan may have married his erstwhile backing singer Carolyn Dennis in 1980 and fathered two children with her, but he has managed to sustain a total news blackout on the issue. Yet whatever personal chaos may teem behind the Dylan legend, nothing can tarnish the grandeur of his reputation as the great folk-rock-poet from the 60s. The world has fixed for all time what it wants him to stand for. Wherever he goes, regardless of how dismal his previous couple of albums may have been, civic dignitaries or august panels of his peers are eager to heap fresh honours on him. In 1982, he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame (\"this is pretty amazing because I can't read or write a note of music,\" he confessed). In 1989, Springsteen inducted him into the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame, asserting that Dylan \"had the vision and the talent to make a pop song that contained the whole world\". In 1990 Jack Lang, the French culture minister, made him a Commandeur de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in Paris. In 1991, he was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 33rd Grammy Awards. In 1992, a parade of illustrious rock'n'roll dignitaries turned out for the Bob Dylan 30th anniversary celebration concert at New York's Madison Square Garden. And in 1997, Dylan knocked loudly on heaven's door by playing to Pope John Paul II in Bologna, as millions watched on a Euro-wide telecast. HE once presided over the birth of a new artistic medium. Now, as it slides into history, Dylan is being enshrined along with it. It may be that we're coming to the end of the whole tradition of art and artists that he has represented, even if his son Jakob is making a belated stab at rock stardom with his own band, The Wallflowers. \"I think we're coming to the end of the Byronic age, I'm convinced of this,\" suggests Pennebaker. \"The role of the Byronic hero is no longer valid - marching through life with his noble brow, creating this forceful art. In the 60s, kids in high school wanted to be in rock'n'roll bands, but now they want to go into internet start-ups.
