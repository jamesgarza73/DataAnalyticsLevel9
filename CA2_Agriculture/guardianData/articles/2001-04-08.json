One of the striking changes in the way it has been covered over the past few years is the explosion in statistical information.

Crowds are down, advertising has dried up and BSkyB is stalling over the next television deal. Because the Premier League has been built around constant and sustained growth, the scramble will be on to squeeze even more money out of every available source. So licences will be charged for, and taken away if anyone writes anything that endangers the industry's commercial future. </p> <p>And if newspapers pay to report football, why shouldn't they also contribute an entry fee to press conferences and pay royalties to Manchester United each time they print its name?

The reincarnation of the Son of God will strike most people - save for His devoted band of latterday disciples - as a fairly ordinary Mancunian bloke, the sort who spends His Saturday afternoons roaring like hell at Old Trafford or Maine Road. </p> <p>A totally improbable plot for a television drama? It might seem so - until you meet the woman who wants to translate that tale onto the nation's screens. Nicola Shindler has demonstrated that she can make anything in Manchester and make it supremely well. This 32-year-old petite dynamo will, doubtless, take even the Second Coming in her stride if she can secure a commission for it. Which she almost certainly will. Her independent company Red Productions is on as much of a winning streak as her beloved Manchester United, after which it was named. </p> <p>Staff at Red's offices, deep in the bowels of Granada's Manchester studios, are frantically filming two major new drama projects for ITV, both of which will be screened in the autumn. This means Shindler will soon have secured prime-time slots on all the major terrestrial channels. </p> <p>To see why rival drama chiefs place so much faith in Red, tune in to the second series of Clocking Off, currently airing on Mondays on BBC1. The first run of this factory-based fiction was recently judged best drama series in the Royal Television Society awards. Even more impressively, it pulled in 11m viewers, proving one of the big Sunday night successes of last year. </p> <p>Red's first foray into the nation's living rooms was never going to be that popular. Queer as Folk, a hedonistic drama based in Manchester's \"gay village\", was hailed, however, as an instant classic by almost everyone except those moral guardians of middle England at the Daily Mail. Yet Shindler did not set out to shock. \"You can't go into any series thinking this is going to shock the nation, or you're doing it for the wrong reason,\" she says. \"Funny as it may sound, I never looked on Queer as Folk as a gay drama. It was really a story of unrequited love, which is why it appealed to a predominantly female audience.\" </p> <p>She is expecting a similar response to her company's first big commission for ITV. Bob and Rose is about a middle-aged gay bloke who falls for a woman. \"It couldn't be further from Queer as Folk,\" she says. \"But if it means some people typecast us as a gay drama company, so be it.\" </p> <p>Shindler believes her company has broken as many moulds with Clocking Off, which was originally called The Factory. \"We were determined it shouldn't be grey and gritty. The first thing that strikes you about a textile factory is that it's full of colour. We wanted it to look good - in stark contrast to most blue-collar dramas - and the BBC backed us all the way.\" </p> <p>But the real key to Clocking Off's success, she feels, hasn't been its technicolour locations, but its self-contained storylines. \"I still remember Play for Today and I think many people miss those sort of films on television,\" she says. \"We serve up a single story each week and they're really good stories.\" </p> <p>The stories are devised, she hastens to add, not by her but by the network of gifted scriptwriters she has assiduously cultivated. What they have in common is that they have all worked on soap operas. For example, Clocking Off's Paul Abbott - who picked up his own RTS gong last week - cut his creative teeth on Coronation Street. Abbott has also scripted a more lighthearted series, Linda Green, which stars Lisa Tarbuck and will air on ITV in the autumn. </p> <p>\"Soap writers work so hard and develop a real discipline which many other dreamier writers don't understand,\" says Shindler. \"They're also sensible; constantly aware of expense. They know you can't blow the budget to pieces by having 500 soldiers charging over a hill in the first five minutes.\" </p> <p>The value of a soap background was brought home to her early in her career when she worked on Cracker with Jimmy McGovern, who had honed his gritty scripting skills on Brookside. They also worked together on the acclaimed drama documentary Hillsborough. </p> <p>Shindler describes her own background as \"as middle class as they come\". She was raised in Rochdale and educated at Bury grammar school; her mother was a teacher and her father a lawyer. The family moved to Manchester in her mid-teens so she naturally gravitated towards Granada Television when she started to carve out her career in broadcasting. </p> <p>But her route into her local ITV franchisee was via London rather than Manchester. For all that she loves her home town, Shindler knew she had to get out of it for a while to get ahead. After indulging her passion for stage productions at Cambridge (where she swiftly swapped law for history) she initially wanted to be a theatre director. But after working for a while as a sales manager in the publicity department at the Royal Court Theatre, she decided to concentrate on television. </p> <p>\"My tastes have always been very populist,\" she reflects. \"I watch soaps a lot, and football, and I love television in general. I really like things with a regional voice. Regardless of what it is, they're less bland.\" </p> <p>Her own northern accent was cast off at Cambridge. On graduating, she spent seven years in London as a script editor and an assiduous networker. \"Going to Cambridge is what's got me where I'm at,\" she says. \"The connections I made there eased my path into the media world which is, unfortunately, centred in London. I certainly couldn't have done what I'm doing in Manchester now if I hadn't done my time down south. People just wouldn't trust me to deliver what they want.\" </p> <p>That was the sobering message Shindler delivered a few months back at the annual Television from the Nations and Regions conference staged by Salford University. But she also cheered up the audience by enthusing about how the success of dynamic indies such as Red Productions might make it possible for a new generation of northern talent to stay in the north. </p> <p>Her own passion for talent-spotting was amply demonstrated when her company joined forces with Channel 4 to launch Northern Soul, a search for new writing talent in the north-west. They waded through more than 500 scripts before hitting on a handful with real potential. It is a source of some pride for her that eight of the contestants are now writing for television. \"I'm not a writer myself,\" says Shindler. \"I think so differently from writers. I don't delve as deeply as they do. I think they've got the hardest job in television, certainly the loneliest.\" </p> <p>Her own talent is for editing screenplays and seeing the bigger picture. \"I never meant to run a business,\" she says. \"I'm good at it. But I'm only doing very well by doing what I want to do. I absolutely love my life and I want to keep making brilliant drama.\" </p> <p>But no matter what she and the writers she so admires manage to make, she suspects it will never match the best television produced across the Atlantic. \"My favourite dramas are still American,\" she says, \"I wouldn't miss an episode of ER or Sex in the City. The brilliant thing about US TV is the team-writing. And the men in charge are writers.\" </p> <p>Her ambitions for now are confined to the small screen. Her one experience of working on a film - Jimmy McGovern's Heart - was more frustrating than fulfilling. \"Financing films is a real marathon effort,\" she says. \"I just haven't got time in my life for that. I really enjoy working in television. And it's so much easier making dramas in Manchester than London.\" </p> <p>But the money and patronage are located in London, so she has to commute regularly to the capital. \"People should come up here more often rather than waiting for me to come to them,\" she says forlornly, only too well aware that even if Manchester were to host the Second Coming, it wouldn't be enough to lure some media execs out of the metropolis. </p> <p>\u0095 Rob Brown is senior lecturer in journalism at the University of Salford</p>",

Nicola Shindler has demonstrated that she can make anything in Manchester and make it supremely well. This 32-year-old petite dynamo will, doubtless, take even the Second Coming in her stride if she can secure a commission for it. Which she almost certainly will. Her independent company Red Productions is on as much of a winning streak as her beloved Manchester United, after which it was named. Staff at Red's offices, deep in the bowels of Granada's Manchester studios, are frantically filming two major new drama projects for ITV, both of which will be screened in the autumn. This means Shindler will soon have secured prime-time slots on all the major terrestrial channels. To see why rival drama chiefs place so much faith in Red, tune in to the second series of Clocking Off, currently airing on Mondays on BBC1. The first run of this factory-based fiction was recently judged best drama series in the Royal Television Society awards. Even more impressively, it pulled in 11m viewers, proving one of the big Sunday night successes of last year. Red's first foray into the nation's living rooms was never going to be that popular. Queer as Folk, a hedonistic drama based in Manchester's \"gay village\", was hailed, however, as an instant classic by almost everyone except those moral guardians of middle England at the Daily Mail. Yet Shindler did not set out to shock. \"You can't go into any series thinking this is going to shock the nation, or you're doing it for the wrong reason,\" she says. \"Funny as it may sound, I never looked on Queer as Folk as a gay drama. It was really a story of unrequited love, which is why it appealed to a predominantly female audience.\" She is expecting a similar response to her company's first big commission for ITV. Bob and Rose is about a middle-aged gay bloke who falls for a woman. \"It couldn't be further from Queer as Folk,\" she says. \"But if it means some people typecast us as a gay drama company, so be it.\" Shindler believes her company has broken as many moulds with Clocking Off, which was originally called The Factory. \"We were determined it shouldn't be grey and gritty. The first thing that strikes you about a textile factory is that it's full of colour. We wanted it to look good - in stark contrast to most blue-collar dramas - and the BBC backed us all the way.\" But the real key to Clocking Off's success, she feels, hasn't been its technicolour locations, but its self-contained storylines. \"I still remember Play for Today and I think many people miss those sort of films on television,\" she says. \"We serve up a single story each week and they're really good stories.\" The stories are devised, she hastens to add, not by her but by the network of gifted scriptwriters she has assiduously cultivated. What they have in common is that they have all worked on soap operas. For example, Clocking Off's Paul Abbott - who picked up his own RTS gong last week - cut his creative teeth on Coronation Street. Abbott has also scripted a more lighthearted series, Linda Green, which stars Lisa Tarbuck and will air on ITV in the autumn. \"Soap writers work so hard and develop a real discipline which many other dreamier writers don't understand,\" says Shindler. \"They're also sensible; constantly aware of expense. They know you can't blow the budget to pieces by having 500 soldiers charging over a hill in the first five minutes.\" The value of a soap background was brought home to her early in her career when she worked on Cracker with Jimmy McGovern, who had honed his gritty scripting skills on Brookside. They also worked together on the acclaimed drama documentary Hillsborough. Shindler describes her own background as \"as middle class as they come\". She was raised in Rochdale and educated at Bury grammar school; her mother was a teacher and her father a lawyer. The family moved to Manchester in her mid-teens so she naturally gravitated towards Granada Television when she started to carve out her career in broadcasting. But her route into her local ITV franchisee was via London rather than Manchester. For all that she loves her home town, Shindler knew she had to get out of it for a while to get ahead. After indulging her passion for stage productions at Cambridge (where she swiftly swapped law for history) she initially wanted to be a theatre director. But after working for a while as a sales manager in the publicity department at the Royal Court Theatre, she decided to concentrate on television. \"My tastes have always been very populist,\" she reflects. \"I watch soaps a lot, and football, and I love television in general. I really like things with a regional voice. Regardless of what it is, they're less bland.\" Her own northern accent was cast off at Cambridge. On graduating, she spent seven years in London as a script editor and an assiduous networker. \"Going to Cambridge is what's got me where I'm at,\" she says. \"The connections I made there eased my path into the media world which is, unfortunately, centred in London. I certainly couldn't have done what I'm doing in Manchester now if I hadn't done my time down south. People just wouldn't trust me to deliver what they want.\" That was the sobering message Shindler delivered a few months back at the annual Television from the Nations and Regions conference staged by Salford University. But she also cheered up the audience by enthusing about how the success of dynamic indies such as Red Productions might make it possible for a new generation of northern talent to stay in the north. Her own passion for talent-spotting was amply demonstrated when her company joined forces with Channel 4 to launch Northern Soul, a search for new writing talent in the north-west. They waded through more than 500 scripts before hitting on a handful with real potential. It is a source of some pride for her that eight of the contestants are now writing for television. \"I'm not a writer myself,\" says Shindler. \"I think so differently from writers. I don't delve as deeply as they do. I think they've got the hardest job in television, certainly the loneliest.\" Her own talent is for editing screenplays and seeing the bigger picture. \"I never meant to run a business,\" she says. \"I'm good at it. But I'm only doing very well by doing what I want to do. I absolutely love my life and I want to keep making brilliant drama.\" But no matter what she and the writers she so admires manage to make, she suspects it will never match the best television produced across the Atlantic. \"My favourite dramas are still American,\" she says, \"I wouldn't miss an episode of ER or Sex in the City. The brilliant thing about US TV is the team-writing. And the men in charge are writers.\" Her ambitions for now are confined to the small screen. Her one experience of working on a film - Jimmy McGovern's Heart - was more frustrating than fulfilling. \"Financing films is a real marathon effort,\" she says. \"I just haven't got time in my life for that. I really enjoy working in television. And it's so much easier making dramas in Manchester than London.\" But the money and patronage are located in London, so she has to commute regularly to the capital. \"People should come up here more often rather than waiting for me to come to them,\" she says forlornly, only too well aware that even if Manchester were to host the Second Coming, it wouldn't be enough to lure some media execs out of the metropolis. \u0095 Rob Brown is senior lecturer in journalism at the University of Salford",

      "body": "<p>Ray Winstone slumps across the bar opposite me, a bottle of beer in his hand and a weary expression on his face. Our eyes meet for a second, then he hauls himself upright and watches as an elderly man escorts a tall, blond twentysomething model from the Kings Cross boozer we're in. \"Evening, George,\" he says, taking a swig. But then the lager bubbles up, there's froth all over the counter and Wintone sighs heavily. Bubbles means another take. Being the voice of Holsten Pils ain't all it's cracked up to be. </p> <p>Winstone is following in a noble line, of course. Donald Pleasance, Griff Rhys Jones, Jeff Goldblum and Dennis Leary have all spoken up for the bottled lager since the 1970s. There is something that stands out about Winstone's campaign, though. He's not weird. In fact, he's the opposite of weird. In the \u00a36m campaign, which broke yesterday in the ad breaks during the FA Cup games on Sky Sports, Winstone is the down-to-earth Cockney geezer, living large in a mansion and enjoying a good time down the boozer with his pals. In a series of far-flung pub arguments he ponders which is the best crisp flavour or the best type of film, concluding that - for all the debate on these frivolous subjects - he's a man who knows which beer he prefers. </p> <p>The campaign strapline claims that Holsten Pils is the \"daddy\" of bottled beers, which is something of an abrupt departure for Holsten, which came on to the market in blaze of weirdness, calling itself the Odd Lager and dropping brand personalities when they became too well known. To move from quirky scripts to reassuring geezerdom seems, well, odd. </p> <p>\"The campaign pretty much comes from the research we did with our core group of drinkers,\" explains Chris Willingham, a partner at Holsten's agency TBWA/London which has worked on the brand for 20 years. \"We found that they liked the fact that Holsten was original and had been around for a long time at a time when there were loads of new bottled beers on the market.\" </p> <p>And if reassurance seems a funny thing for a beer ad to get involved with, that's because the world of lager is changing. In the old days, of course, things were easy. From lager's 1970s move into the mass market until the end of the 1980s, people would either be lager drinkers or bitter drinkers - with a glass of white wine for the ladies. You'd use the drink brand you chose as a badge to show who you were. Trendy readers of the Face and people who had tried stronger foreign lager on package holidays flitted from bizarre bottled import to bizarre bottled import such as Holsten, which had more than 50% of the bottled lager market in the 1980s. Then along came ecstasy, the recession and some complex government legislation and everything went funny. </p> <p>In the early 1990s, beer sales went through the floor. No one knew whether this was because consumers had no money or because they were spending their money on pills. Probably both. Then, in 1992, new legislation forced the breweries to sell off most of their tied pubs and start selling beer in an open market, competing to get their products into all the new independent bars and pubs, rather than just dish it out in their own little chains. </p> <p>Beer sales kept falling, so brewers kept introducing new brands in an attempt to draw people back and, with low-flavour drinks such as Dry and Ice beers and the methanol-soaked alcopops, tried to woo the pillheads back. Then, in 1995, something strange happened. We started drinking beer again. </p> <p>Brewers were baffled. They spent millions on researching what was going on and found something unprecedented. Over-35s were carrying on in the same old lager vs bitter kind of way, but under-35s were doing things that consumers just weren't supposed to. They'd developed a complex repertoire of stimulant-related social behaviour across the country almost overnight. </p> <p>Friday night might be drug night, then Saturday afternoon might be lager in front of the footie with a vodka-fuelled Saturday night and a Sunday evening on the bitter or Caffreys. Even stranger, the repertoire might vary in a single evening. Drinkers understood the strength of the beer and how much they could take. Thus, they might switch between different strength beers and spirits to ensure they were as drunk as they wanted to be. This isn't very British. </p> <p>The following year, something even less British happened. Stella Artois suddenly came from nowhere and became the fifth best-selling off-licence brand with a bullet, behind Bell's, Gordon's, Carling Black Label and the Famous Grouse. It reached number three in 1997 and became number one in 1998. Stella sales in off-licences now account for more cash than the generic sale of gin. </p> <p>Stella achieved this by using an overtly French ad campaign at precisely the time that its main rival, Carling Black Label, was using a defiantly Euro-sceptic campaign poking fun at the Germans and the French which, for some reason, just didn't wash with the Brits. At the same time, the so-called \"value\" category of lagers such as Harp, Skol and Kestrel - which are drunk in their gallons by those who seek a widely available brand without trendy pretensions and who care about price - simply fell apart. </p> <p>\"Since 1996, we've seen the long-term collapse of the so-called economy or value lager,\" says James McCoy, senior consultant, consumer goods for the consumer research company Mintel. \"Economy lagers' share of the market has fallen from 31% in 1994 to 15% in 1999, while premium lagers' share has increased from 26% in 1994 to 38% in 1999. At the same time, light drinking is on the increase, meaning that Brits are drinking less volume and paying more money for it.\" </p> <p>This is all about what the fashion magazines are calling the democratisation of style. Where the boom in the 1980s was confined to a handful of wealthy city and media types, this boom is about the rest of the population wanting nice bars - hence All Bar One, pine floorboards , the collapse of the own-brand high-street label at C&amp;A and Marks &amp; Spencer and the rise of the smuggled designer label or the Matelan bargain designer wear. Hence also the success of premium brands such as Stella, and hence Holsten's bid to reclaim its position as the original premium brand. \"We were here first, if you want some proper class,\" Winstone declares, subtextually. \"The rest of you, piss off. Especially that Budweiser nonsense.\" </p> <p>Over at Carling, they're having a similar rethink, despite the standard lager category (into which Carling falls) holding its own. When the Edinburgh-based Leith Agency picked up the Carling account last year, it scrapped the jingoistic assaults on French lorry-driver blockades. What was the point when a French lager was steaming up the charts? </p> <p>The new campaign focuses, according to a spokeswoman, on people's desire for Carling. In the latest ad a young man is hoodwinked when a girl drops an eyeball in his lager, allowing her to snaffle his pint. The ad breaks on April 13, and the Bass spokeswoman says: \"The new campaign broadens the brand's appeal and takes a more self-assured approach, not showing the brand name in the adverts and communicating the quality of the liquid through drinker desire.\" </p> <p>So with Holsten becoming Carling and Carling becoming Holsten in order to compete with Stella which is becoming as unlike Budweiser as it's possible to be, it can make the changing habits of the nation seem a little confusing. But you shouldn't worry. Because the reassuring thing about Britain is that, when you really want to know what's going on, it's always better to look at it through the bottom of a beer glass.</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Feargal Sharkey was back on stage last week. The man who gave us Teenage Kicks in 1979 and a solo number one in 1985 with A Good Heart showed he could still hold an audience. Except that this time he was talking, not singing. \"I hope you radio pluggers in the audience are paying attention\" he said, and a hundred leather-jacketed backs suddenly stiffened. </p> <p>Sharkey - distinctive high-pitched Derry voice intact - is midway through a five-year term as a member of the Radio Authority, which awards commercial licences. Now 43 and clad in a sage suit and immaculate tie, he commanded instant attention when he made a hard-hitting \"wake up\" speech to funky DJs, station managers, and Radio 1 executives at the Radio Academy's music forum in London. Afterwards, in the (Heart 106.2-sponsored!) coffee break the pluggers came up to him and gave him a cautious thumbs-up. </p> <p>What few in the audience knew was that he was about to attend a three-day Radio Authority strategy meeting to redefine commercial radio's social and public obligations, its duty to play diverse music, and ensure local radio remains local. It is hard not to interpret this as a public body baring its teeth in exasperation at commercial operators such as GWR, Capital and Chrysalis over a range of issues from plugging their own CDs on air and cheating over \"local\" news, to the sudden spurt in requests to network programmes nationally - cutting costs overnight, but creating quasi-national computerised services. </p> <p>Sharkey's first message though was to the pop/rock music industry. He ticked it off for its ostrich-style behaviour: the sector has made only one response to the government's communications white paper which vaguely envisages further ownership concentration. \"The radio industry is facing its most radical overhaul of broadcasting legislation since the 1980s,\" he warned, \"and 90% of its output is music. How many times have you heard that old mantra: 'Oh I'm not going to playlist your record, it's not in the top 40'?\" he asked. He was equally direct about radio operators, scornful of their businessman's rush for the safe mainstream with chart-based formats. </p> <p>\"What [Sharkey] can bring to this is the role of the practitioner,\" culture secretary Chris Smith said on his appointment in 1998. \"He's got hands-on experience, which very often people sitting on these regulatory bodies don't have.\" And wrapped around it all was a robust defence of the work of the Radio Authority, due to be subsumed as a wing of Ofcom. </p> <p>Sharkey's rare appearance was designed partly to answer an intemperate speech made by Ralph Bernard, head of GWR (Classic FM), who, two months ago, painted the authority as amateurs, standing in the way of change by insisting programming formats were stuck to. The issue of whether a station could play Britney Spears seems to have been a flashpoint. </p> <p>Sharkey says he's gone back over the 78 variations to formats applied for and found 70 were granted, five partially. Only three were rejected. \"I asked, is there any foundation in this? Let's have a look. It's a fuss about nothing. If anything we have been too reasonable.\" </p> <p>As for authority members being ignorant, he said: \"It's an easy accusation to make. All applications contain a huge amount of research. We have access to all sorts of experts. It is unreasonable to say we don't know what we're talking about.\" </p> <p>He also attacked the current commercial lobbying which wants to put flesh on future legislation aimed at allowing two operators plus the BBC to run stations in any single area. The Radio Authority says three should be the minimum, each controlling 30% of the sector. Sharkey warned: \"This is three operators [potentially] nationwide, fixing playlists. It's not that many.\" He points to current experience: that companies converge on the profitable middle ground, creating a sameness in broadcast music. </p> <p>When interviewed afterwards, he explained that the Radio Authority conference \"is about where to draw the line. Our task is to define local. It's a huge item on our agenda. What is local radio? Does it matter if the man in Glasgow listened to the same record at the same time as a man in London, sometimes it can be the same DJ. I've yet to be convinced. </p> <p>\"It's the bits in between that define the localness. But also the choice of music. Garage music is huge in London, but nothing outside the M25. West Midlands has a big following for country music. </p> <p>\"Ownership does affect output. Every time an independent station is bought up by a bigger operator, the new owner is on the line to the authority, wanting to change the format.\" </p> <p>Central to his concerns is that commercial licensees, bar the three national ones, pay a peppercorn rent for frequencies. He calculates it costs \u00a380,000 for the right to broadcast to 10m Londoners. Therefore, Sharkey reasons, there continues to be a requirement for some return to the public good in order to balance that privilege. A cultural gain. \"I don't think it is unreasonable to say there are strings attached to the licences.\" </p> <p>The worry is that FM networks are creeping towards acceptance of a situation where they network daily between 10pm and 6am, not just for the Sunday afternoon chart show. \"FM networks are pushing to do less and less local programming.

My fear is it spreads.\" </p> <p>The authority, when advertising new licences, doesn't suggest formats. So it can only respond to what is on offer. Sharkey says of the 87 applications for licences outside London that he has been involved with, the authority received 65-75% for mainstream chart-based music. \"So invariably we end up licensing 75% mainstream. I suggest there are some people within commercial radio who could be bolder, more creative, more innovative. Right now we have three applications for a new licence in a small town of 100,000 homes.

      "bodyText": "Feargal Sharkey was back on stage last week. The man who gave us Teenage Kicks in 1979 and a solo number one in 1985 with A Good Heart showed he could still hold an audience. Except that this time he was talking, not singing. \"I hope you radio pluggers in the audience are paying attention\" he said, and a hundred leather-jacketed backs suddenly stiffened. Sharkey - distinctive high-pitched Derry voice intact - is midway through a five-year term as a member of the Radio Authority, which awards commercial licences. Now 43 and clad in a sage suit and immaculate tie, he commanded instant attention when he made a hard-hitting \"wake up\" speech to funky DJs, station managers, and Radio 1 executives at the Radio Academy's music forum in London. Afterwards, in the (Heart 106.2-sponsored!) coffee break the pluggers came up to him and gave him a cautious thumbs-up. What few in the audience knew was that he was about to attend a three-day Radio Authority strategy meeting to redefine commercial radio's social and public obligations, its duty to play diverse music, and ensure local radio remains local. It is hard not to interpret this as a public body baring its teeth in exasperation at commercial operators such as GWR, Capital and Chrysalis over a range of issues from plugging their own CDs on air and cheating over \"local\" news, to the sudden spurt in requests to network programmes nationally - cutting costs overnight, but creating quasi-national computerised services. Sharkey's first message though was to the pop/rock music industry. He ticked it off for its ostrich-style behaviour: the sector has made only one response to the government's communications white paper which vaguely envisages further ownership concentration. \"The radio industry is facing its most radical overhaul of broadcasting legislation since the 1980s,\" he warned, \"and 90% of its output is music. How many times have you heard that old mantra: 'Oh I'm not going to playlist your record, it's not in the top 40'?\" he asked. He was equally direct about radio operators, scornful of their businessman's rush for the safe mainstream with chart-based formats. \"What [Sharkey] can bring to this is the role of the practitioner,\" culture secretary Chris Smith said on his appointment in 1998. \"He's got hands-on experience, which very often people sitting on these regulatory bodies don't have.\" And wrapped around it all was a robust defence of the work of the Radio Authority, due to be subsumed as a wing of Ofcom. Sharkey's rare appearance was designed partly to answer an intemperate speech made by Ralph Bernard, head of GWR (Classic FM), who, two months ago, painted the authority as amateurs, standing in the way of change by insisting programming formats were stuck to. The issue of whether a station could play Britney Spears seems to have been a flashpoint. Sharkey says he's gone back over the 78 variations to formats applied for and found 70 were granted, five partially. Only three were rejected. \"I asked, is there any foundation in this? Let's have a look. It's a fuss about nothing. If anything we have been too reasonable.\" As for authority members being ignorant, he said: \"It's an easy accusation to make. All applications contain a huge amount of research. We have access to all sorts of experts. It is unreasonable to say we don't know what we're talking about.\" He also attacked the current commercial lobbying which wants to put flesh on future legislation aimed at allowing two operators plus the BBC to run stations in any single area. The Radio Authority says three should be the minimum, each controlling 30% of the sector. Sharkey warned: \"This is three operators [potentially] nationwide, fixing playlists. It's not that many.\" He points to current experience: that companies converge on the profitable middle ground, creating a sameness in broadcast music. When interviewed afterwards, he explained that the Radio Authority conference \"is about where to draw the line. Our task is to define local. It's a huge item on our agenda. What is local radio? Does it matter if the man in Glasgow listened to the same record at the same time as a man in London, sometimes it can be the same DJ. I've yet to be convinced. \"It's the bits in between that define the localness. But also the choice of music. Garage music is huge in London, but nothing outside the M25. West Midlands has a big following for country music. \"Ownership does affect output. Every time an independent station is bought up by a bigger operator, the new owner is on the line to the authority, wanting to change the format.\" Central to his concerns is that commercial licensees, bar the three national ones, pay a peppercorn rent for frequencies. He calculates it costs \u00a380,000 for the right to broadcast to 10m Londoners. Therefore, Sharkey reasons, there continues to be a requirement for some return to the public good in order to balance that privilege. A cultural gain. \"I don't think it is unreasonable to say there are strings attached to the licences.\" The worry is that FM networks are creeping towards acceptance of a situation where they network daily between 10pm and 6am, not just for the Sunday afternoon chart show. \"FM networks are pushing to do less and less local programming. There's been a gentle erosion. The usual request is: 'Can we network our programmes between midnight and 6am, no one's listening?' Are they being unreasonable? My fear is it spreads.\" The authority, when advertising new licences, doesn't suggest formats. So it can only respond to what is on offer. Sharkey says of the 87 applications for licences outside London that he has been involved with, the authority received 65-75% for mainstream chart-based music. \"So invariably we end up licensing 75% mainstream.

      "body": "<p>At midday on Thursday, the entire staff of the Financial Times got an email from chief executive Stephen Hill. A thoroughly modern means of telling staff about a thoroughly modern malaise. The FT internet operations were, he announced, cutting 40 staff. </p> <p>The figure represented around 10% of the workforce dedicated to the newspaper group's internet operations which include <a href=\"http://www.ft.com\" target=\"_NEW\">FT.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.FTyourmoney.com\" target=\"_NEW\">FT Yourmoney</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ftcareerpoint.com\" target=\"_NEW\">FT Careerpoint</a> and <a href=\"http://www.economist.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Economist.com</a>. The group employs 350 dedicated online staff with another hard to quantify number working across both the paper and web-based services. </p> <p>Most of the job losses were among back-office operations, including marketing and product development. But for FT Yourmoney, the personal finance website, the cuts were deeper. Two-thirds of the journalists employed are to lose their jobs as the site is merged with the personal finance operation on the newspaper. </p> <p>The job losses had not been as bad as many at the FT had feared. Rumours of cuts had been circulating in the company's Southwark Bridge offices for months. But the retrenchment is enough to dent the staff's fragile confidence. </p> <p>\"Morale is pretty bad,\" said one FT.com worker. \"The operation has been badly managed from the beginning. A lot of people now think it is inevitable that editorial staff will eventually be sacked.\" </p> <p>Pearson, the owner of the FT Group, has been one of the old media firms most committed to building a presence online. Last year, it spent \u00a3113m on FT Group-related websites alone and another \u00a383m building its online education business. </p> <p>But it appears that even a brand as powerful as the FT has hit the same stark reality as everyone else: the online advertising market is not growing as fast as hoped and may never be large enough to support FT.com. Shares in Pearson are at an 18-month low and the company is under increasing pressure to provide some returns. </p> <p>The emphasis in Hill's email was twofold: to build revenue streams through add-on services and to accelerate the integration of the print and online operations. </p> <p>The group has already launched FT Careerpoint, which allows employers to search a database of CVs for a fee, and Ask FT, which offers a bespoke research service. Its next launch is a mobile phone offering customised breaking news from FT.com, including real-time share prices. </p> <p>FT.com revenues increased threefold to \u00a318m last year. Ambitiously, Hill said that only half the online revenues next year would come from advertising. \"We've always thought of FT.com as more than an advertising medium,\" he said. </p> <p>The FT has probably done more to promote the integration of print and online operations, held up as the paradigm for newspapers, than most of its rivals. Much so far has been on the commercial side. Hill says it is working pretty well. Journalists working on FT.com say the integration still works only haphazardly in practice. \"If they think this is a fully integrated operation, they are living in fantasy land,\" one said. \"Some foreign bureau journalists from Paris or Madrid refuse to file for the website. What tends to happen is that we do the stories during the day and then they put the newspaper stories on at night, and that causes big problems between the two sides.\" </p> <p>There is little evidence to suggest that an online newsroom will work any more effectively than seven-day newspaper operations. In both cases, the journalists in question are doing very different jobs and working to very different timetables. </p> <p> I nvestment in the FT online business will be more like \u00a360m this year and, as start-up costs fade, it at least has a redoubtable success as regards its users. FT.com claims to have 2m unique monthly users and approximately 40m monthly page views, up from 1.1m and 25m in January 2000. For a business such as the FT, which is trying hard to turn itself into an international brand, the promotion alone is a powerful achievement. </p> <p>\"Of course the newspaper currently appears to be doing better. It is an established business, the internet is a start-up,\" Hill said. \"This is the future and we will look back in five years and say where would we have been without this strong digital platform? I see online and print marching forward together very much hand in hand.\" </p> <p>The FT is clearly not alone in facing difficulties. Some financial news rivals, such as TheStreet. co.uk, have closed, others (including CNN and WSJ.com) have cut a far greater number of jobs than the FT. Given that WSJ.com has stood pretty much alone in adopting a more surefire subscription model, that is not particularly encouraging. </p> <p>Hill says the FT internet businesses are still on track for break even by the end of 2002 and is less gloomy than many about the advertising prospects. The reason for nervousness among the company's staff is that at the moment the promise is still no more than an unproven operational structure, in an unproven market, with still uncertain revenue streams.</p>",

But the retrenchment is enough to dent the staff's fragile confidence. \"Morale is pretty bad,\" said one FT.com worker. \"The operation has been badly managed from the beginning. A lot of people now think it is inevitable that editorial staff will eventually be sacked.\" Pearson, the owner of the FT Group, has been one of the old media firms most committed to building a presence online. Last year, it spent \u00a3113m on FT Group-related websites alone and another \u00a383m building its online education business. But it appears that even a brand as powerful as the FT has hit the same stark reality as everyone else: the online advertising market is not growing as fast as hoped and may never be large enough to support FT.com. Shares in Pearson are at an 18-month low and the company is under increasing pressure to provide some returns. The emphasis in Hill's email was twofold: to build revenue streams through add-on services and to accelerate the integration of the print and online operations. The group has already launched FT Careerpoint, which allows employers to search a database of CVs for a fee, and Ask FT, which offers a bespoke research service. Its next launch is a mobile phone offering customised breaking news from FT.com, including real-time share prices. FT.com revenues increased threefold to \u00a318m last year. Ambitiously, Hill said that only half the online revenues next year would come from advertising. \"We've always thought of FT.com as more than an advertising medium,\" he said. The FT has probably done more to promote the integration of print and online operations, held up as the paradigm for newspapers, than most of its rivals. Much so far has been on the commercial side. Hill says it is working pretty well. Journalists working on FT.com say the integration still works only haphazardly in practice. \"If they think this is a fully integrated operation, they are living in fantasy land,\" one said. \"Some foreign bureau journalists from Paris or Madrid refuse to file for the website. What tends to happen is that we do the stories during the day and then they put the newspaper stories on at night, and that causes big problems between the two sides.\" There is little evidence to suggest that an online newsroom will work any more effectively than seven-day newspaper operations. In both cases, the journalists in question are doing very different jobs and working to very different timetables. I nvestment in the FT online business will be more like \u00a360m this year and, as start-up costs fade, it at least has a redoubtable success as regards its users. FT.com claims to have 2m unique monthly users and approximately 40m monthly page views, up from 1.1m and 25m in January 2000. For a business such as the FT, which is trying hard to turn itself into an international brand, the promotion alone is a powerful achievement. \"Of course the newspaper currently appears to be doing better. It is an established business, the internet is a start-up,\" Hill said. \"This is the future and we will look back in five years and say where would we have been without this strong digital platform? I see online and print marching forward together very much hand in hand.\" The FT is clearly not alone in facing difficulties. Some financial news rivals, such as TheStreet. co.uk, have closed, others (including CNN and WSJ.com) have cut a far greater number of jobs than the FT. Given that WSJ.com has stood pretty much alone in adopting a more surefire subscription model, that is not particularly encouraging. Hill says the FT internet businesses are still on track for break even by the end of 2002 and is less gloomy than many about the advertising prospects. The reason for nervousness among the company's staff is that at the moment the promise is still no more than an unproven operational structure, in an unproven market, with still uncertain revenue streams.",

It was against the public interest and Article 10 of the Human Rights Act 1998, the court ruled, for the attorney general to try to censor what Punch could publish.

This prescribes the basic right to freedom of expression, setting out certain restrictions which may be imposed but only if strictly necessary for various public interest reasons. The European court of human rights has long emphasised the importance of the media's role. For example, in the 1991 Spycatcher case - also concerning whether allegations by a former MI5 officer could be published - the court stated that: \"Freedom of expression . . . is applicable not only to information or ideas that are favourably received, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb.\" As the media's right to publish and broadcast matters of public interest is \"one of the essential foundations of a democratic society\", the exceptions to freedom of expression must be narrowly drawn and convincingly established.

However, one test of whether this defence is valid is the \"tone\" used in the article(s). This was made even clearer in the recent Bruce Grobbelaar ruling. The court of appeal rejected the Sun's QP defence regarding its match-fixing allegations, stating that newspapers who choose to publish expos\u00e9s unambiguously asserting an individual's guilt do so at their own risk. Moreover, there was no human right to disseminate untrue information and no public interest in being misinformed. </p> <p>It is clear that the ruling was heavily influenced by the strong tone of the Sun's articles. But if the public need to know that football matches are being fixed, then surely banner headlines and repeated coverage are what is required?

The courts have therefore refused applications to restrain publication of information relating to \"crimes, frauds and misdeeds\" in a number of instances, ranging from an article about the Church of Scientology to expos\u00e9s of police corruption and a laundry cartel.The high water mark of the public interest defence was in Lion Laboratories vs Evans (1985).

      "body": "<p>How to make it pay? How to make it PAY? On both sides of the Atlantic, web executives (those few that remain) are murmuring this question in their feverish sleep and going over and over their options: \"We tried e-commerce - too premature... advertising and sponsorship - forget it! Hey, how about subscriptions? No, no we tried that one, remember?\" and so on. </p> <p>This month the subscription model - among other last-ditch attempts to turn a penny out of content - is back. Last week the 365 Corporation, which specialises in digital media communities, announced it was cutting all editorial from <a href=\"http://www.gay365.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Gay365</a> and introducing a subscription fee of \u00a311.95 a year in line with <a href=\"http://www.personals365.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Personals365</a>, which provides a kind of online virtual sauna for couples to check out each other's credentials and chat. IPC Electric is also about to introduce pay-for applications into cross-platform portals such as <a href=\"http://www.UnmissableTV.com\" target=\"_NEW\">UnmissableTV.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.NME.com\" target=\"_NEW\">NME.com</a>, while throughout the division it is looking for new revenue streams. </p> <p>We all know that sex, or at least the promise of sex, sells on the internet (industry revenues are expected to hit \u00a32.26bn in 2001). There is also a proven market, if a small one, for mission-critical business information or \"inside dope\" (<a href=\"http://www.thestreet.com\" target=\"_NEW\">The Street.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.insider.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Insider.com</a> and the UK's <a href=\"http://www.the451.com\" target=\"_NEW\">the451.com</a> \"the technology firestarter\" and <a href=\"http://www.breakingviews.com\" target=\"_NEW\">BreakingViews.com</a>, all work on subscriptions) but will people pay for good jokes? </p> <p>Bob Kohn, CEO of <a href=\"http://www.laugh.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Laugh.com</a>, believes so. The former entertainment lawyer and co-founder of eMusic has just launched the comedy destination site (which aims to make money from a combination of selling comedy CDs and wireless subscriptions) slap-bang in the middle of the dot.com recession. And it isn't an April Fools' - it has $2.2m backing. </p> <p>\"There is a huge demand for comedy - some of the highest-paid acts [such as Jim Carrey and Tom Hanks] are comedians,\" asserts Kohn. The idea is to raise the quality of those jokes which get passed around by email, using fresh material from 10 or 15 well-known comedians in audio or video form. And Kohn has a pet theory: \"Comedy is recession proof, it has negative beta during a recession - people look for outlets to relieve the tensions of the day.\" He hopes to go public in a year, when he thinks there will be a resurgence in demand for digital companies. </p> <p>Laugh.com at least has the product (the site is really a front for Kohn's profitable comedy CD production company which distributes to 6,000 stores) and the names to back it up, including top US comics George Carlin, Phyllis Diller, Red Skelton, Milton Berle and cult prank callers the Jerky Boys; not to mention Peter Sellers' daughter Victoria who \"interviews\" notorious madam Heidi Fleiss seeking sex tips. </p> <p>Kohn is cautiously excited about the wireless service (\"give it three years\") which will deliver one-minute clips and daily postings from your favourite comic to PDAs and future phones for $2 a month. He is confident that the west will take to it just as the Japanese have to Manga on their I-mode mobile service. </p> <p>Laugh.com's \"Management Message\" has a sobering disregard for the dot.com business model: \"The proliferation of [our] hardware and software that enables the management and playback of downloadable audio and uploadable orgasms is currently driving growth in the sector... Forrester research estimates that total online comedy revenues in the US are expected to grow from where it is now to where it is later...\" You certainly need a sense of humour to be in new media at the moment. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/\" target=\"_NEW\">NewYorker.com</a>, the long-awaited companion site of America's most civilised weekly, would have to agree. \"Want more traffic? Use humour,\" advises its sidecar site <a href=\"http://www.cartoonbank.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Cartoonbank.com</a>, which licenses quality cartoons for $15 a throw and sells funny T-shirts. New Yorker.com and Tina Brown's <a href=\"http://www.talkmagazine.com/\" target=\"_NEW\">Talkmagazine.com</a> site - which launched head to head in February - are the new breed of dot.coms whose main boast is that they are run on a shoestring, or as Kohn puts it, are \"like a one-storey whorehouse: no fucking overheads.\" </p> <p>The NewYorker site, which is supposedly entirely produced by the magazine's deputy editor, is surprisingly rich in content, offering features, columns and comment from the magazine and some \"online only\" features. The more glitterati-centred Talk.com, on the other hand, is flashy but lacking in substance - all Talk and no action. Instead of real articles, we are treated to 20-second tasters with \"Oh no, you don't!\" prompts to subscribe the magazine (71% off the cover price if you buy online). It's really no more than a trailer to boost Talk's subscriptions. </p> <p>\"Publishers that dumped millions into the electronic void are facing a new reality,\" says The Standard.com, California's favourite documenter of the digital world. \"A website is no longer considered a potential cash cow, but a necessary expense - a way to sell subscriptions while building credibility and brand awareness.\" So after five years of web literacy, we are back to where we started. </p> <p>Meanwhile, even the US's most established subscription sites are still struggling to make the model work. Last week The Street.com laid off another 20% of its staff, following last year's cull of 111 staff worldwide, including the entire thestreet.co.uk team, and reduced the annual fees for its five premium services. Management insist there is still money in the bank. Despite the fact that RealMoney.com has around 75,000 subscribers paying $200 a year and subscriptions now make up 40% of its total revenue, editor-in-chief Dave Kansas says: \"Subscriptions are not a silver bullet by any means.\" </p> <p>Inside.com, which markets valuable \"first to know\" information to people in the media, digital, publishing, film and music industries, is reluctant to comment on its premium content model, since it has just merged with Brill and is in the process of \"rethinking the subscriptions model\".

      "bodyText": "How to make it pay? How to make it PAY? On both sides of the Atlantic, web executives (those few that remain) are murmuring this question in their feverish sleep and going over and over their options: \"We tried e-commerce - too premature... advertising and sponsorship - forget it! Hey, how about subscriptions? No, no we tried that one, remember?\" and so on. This month the subscription model - among other last-ditch attempts to turn a penny out of content - is back. Last week the 365 Corporation, which specialises in digital media communities, announced it was cutting all editorial from Gay365 and introducing a subscription fee of \u00a311.95 a year in line with Personals365, which provides a kind of online virtual sauna for couples to check out each other's credentials and chat. IPC Electric is also about to introduce pay-for applications into cross-platform portals such as UnmissableTV.com and NME.com, while throughout the division it is looking for new revenue streams. We all know that sex, or at least the promise of sex, sells on the internet (industry revenues are expected to hit \u00a32.26bn in 2001). There is also a proven market, if a small one, for mission-critical business information or \"inside dope\" (The Street.com, Insider.com and the UK's the451.com \"the technology firestarter\" and BreakingViews.com, all work on subscriptions) but will people pay for good jokes? Bob Kohn, CEO of Laugh.com, believes so. The former entertainment lawyer and co-founder of eMusic has just launched the comedy destination site (which aims to make money from a combination of selling comedy CDs and wireless subscriptions) slap-bang in the middle of the dot.com recession. And it isn't an April Fools' - it has $2.2m backing. \"There is a huge demand for comedy - some of the highest-paid acts [such as Jim Carrey and Tom Hanks] are comedians,\" asserts Kohn. The idea is to raise the quality of those jokes which get passed around by email, using fresh material from 10 or 15 well-known comedians in audio or video form. And Kohn has a pet theory: \"Comedy is recession proof, it has negative beta during a recession - people look for outlets to relieve the tensions of the day.\" He hopes to go public in a year, when he thinks there will be a resurgence in demand for digital companies. Laugh.com at least has the product (the site is really a front for Kohn's profitable comedy CD production company which distributes to 6,000 stores) and the names to back it up, including top US comics George Carlin, Phyllis Diller, Red Skelton, Milton Berle and cult prank callers the Jerky Boys; not to mention Peter Sellers' daughter Victoria who \"interviews\" notorious madam Heidi Fleiss seeking sex tips. Kohn is cautiously excited about the wireless service (\"give it three years\") which will deliver one-minute clips and daily postings from your favourite comic to PDAs and future phones for $2 a month. He is confident that the west will take to it just as the Japanese have to Manga on their I-mode mobile service. Laugh.com's \"Management Message\" has a sobering disregard for the dot.com business model: \"The proliferation of [our] hardware and software that enables the management and playback of downloadable audio and uploadable orgasms is currently driving growth in the sector... Forrester research estimates that total online comedy revenues in the US are expected to grow from where it is now to where it is later...\" You certainly need a sense of humour to be in new media at the moment. NewYorker.com, the long-awaited companion site of America's most civilised weekly, would have to agree. \"Want more traffic? Use humour,\" advises its sidecar site Cartoonbank.com, which licenses quality cartoons for $15 a throw and sells funny T-shirts. New Yorker.com and Tina Brown's Talkmagazine.com site - which launched head to head in February - are the new breed of dot.coms whose main boast is that they are run on a shoestring, or as Kohn puts it, are \"like a one-storey whorehouse: no fucking overheads.\" The NewYorker site, which is supposedly entirely produced by the magazine's deputy editor, is surprisingly rich in content, offering features, columns and comment from the magazine and some \"online only\" features. The more glitterati-centred Talk.com, on the other hand, is flashy but lacking in substance - all Talk and no action. Instead of real articles, we are treated to 20-second tasters with \"Oh no, you don't!\" prompts to subscribe the magazine (71% off the cover price if you buy online). It's really no more than a trailer to boost Talk's subscriptions. \"Publishers that dumped millions into the electronic void are facing a new reality,\" says The Standard.com, California's favourite documenter of the digital world. \"A website is no longer considered a potential cash cow, but a necessary expense - a way to sell subscriptions while building credibility and brand awareness.\" So after five years of web literacy, we are back to where we started. Meanwhile, even the US's most established subscription sites are still struggling to make the model work. Last week The Street.com laid off another 20% of its staff, following last year's cull of 111 staff worldwide, including the entire thestreet.co.uk team, and reduced the annual fees for its five premium services. Management insist there is still money in the bank. Despite the fact that RealMoney.com has around 75,000 subscribers paying $200 a year and subscriptions now make up 40% of its total revenue, editor-in-chief Dave Kansas says: \"Subscriptions are not a silver bullet by any means.\" Inside.com, which markets valuable \"first to know\" information to people in the media, digital, publishing, film and music industries, is reluctant to comment on its premium content model, since it has just merged with Brill and is in the process of \"rethinking the subscriptions model\". The path to profitability these days is less about innovative ideas and more about enthusiastic cost slashing. All eyes will be on Napster when it relaunches this summer as a legitimate subscription-based music downloads site under the aegis of German publisher Bertelsmann. Market research among 20,000 of the 57m current users clearly indicates that people are prepared to pay for the service they have enjoyed for free in the past.

      "bodyText": "Stella McCartney has made the surprise decision to allow cameras follow her around for an extraordinary fly-on-the-wall documentary. The daughter of Beatles legend Sir Paul McCartney has put her trust in director Geoff Wonfor, who has formed a close bond with the children of one of Britain's most famous families following his epic 1995, The Beatles Anthology. The 29 year-old \"rock royalty\" is famously reticent about giving interviews, but approached Mr Wonfor - husband of Granada boss Andrea - about making the documentary because they have worked together before. A bidding war has already broken out behind the scenes with the BBC, ITV and Channel 4 all expected to vie for the rights to screen the programme. Filming has already begun and it is expected to feature a first-hand glimpse of a celebrity world that has up to now been off-limits to the cameras. As a fashion designer Ms McCartney mixes in high-powered celebrity circles with the likes of Madonna, whose wedding dress she designed, Sadie Frost and Kate Moss. ITV and the BBC have both expressed an interest in the programme. The documentary will follow her as she leaves French fashion house Chloe and sets up her own designer label, backed by Gucci. \"I think Geoff was wondering why she had approached him now, but then the news broke that she was leaving Chloe to set up this new label with Gucci,\" said a friend of the programme-maker. Ms McCartney also wants to establish herself as a name in her own right and is keen to shake off the constant suspicion that she got where she is today because of her father. Mr Wonfor's credits include the Tube and the Beatles Anthology and he has also worked on a documentary about Ms McCartney's late mother Linda. The Beatles Anthology, a landmark 10-hour series produced by Mr Wonfor, prompted a \u00a36m bidding battle in 1995 between the BBC, ITV and Channel 4 that was eventually won by ITV.",

The raids - the second round-up of liberals in less than a month - appeared to be aimed at leaders of Iran's main dissident group, the Freedom Movement. All the organisation's offices in the country have been shut, newspapers reported. The move is seen as an attempt by hardliners to reinforce their position before the presidential election in June. The conservative judiciary, backed by the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has been clamping down on dissidents and reformers allied to the president, Mohammad Khatami. A statement by the Revolutionary Court, broadcast on state radio, said those arrested were \"accused of attempts to overthrow the regime\". The Freedom Movement, which draws its support mainly from students and intellectuals, led an interim government after the 1979 Islamic revolution before being pushed aside by the political clergy. Though formally banned, it had generally been tolerated until last month when more than 20 people were arrested at a meeting in Tehran. Since then, the Revolutionary Court has ordered an end to all Freedom Movement activities. The movement argues such activities are permitted by the constitution. Ali Mobasheri, the head of the Revolutionary Court, said the new arrests were prompted by \"confessions\" made by those in custody. \"Details are not clear yet, but if the charges are proven further action will be taken against them,\" he told the Iranian Students' News Agency. Among those arrested on Saturday were Hashemi Sabaghian, a former interior minister, and Mohammad Tavasoli, a former mayor of Tehran. Mr Tavasoli's daughter Zahra told Associated Press yesterday: \"Agents of the Revolutionary Court searched our home on Saturday for 12 hours and took away anything they wanted including all my father's private papers, computer discs, books and papers. They also took my father on Saturday evening.\" Ibrahim Yazdi, leader of the Freedom Movement and a former foreign minister, was in the US when the first arrests took place last month and has not returned to Iran.",

The Bangladeshi \"ironmen\" who normally do the pressing look on smiling, having been told that this is the job she did at her own factory in England for many years. </p> <p>But although the work and equipment are similar, the gulf in pay and conditions could scarcely be wider. The lines of mainly young women who make Littlewoods clothes at the Dressmen factory - something of a showcase in the mushrooming Bangladeshi garment industry - get less than a fiftieth of the hourly rate earned by their relatively low-paid British counterparts. Unskilled workers start on the industry minimum of 930 takas a month for a six-day week - \u00a312 at the going exchange rate. The more experienced are on 1,295 takas (\u00a316.80) basic. Ten-hour days are the norm. </p> <p>At the nearby Islam Garments factory, where Ms Gale and two fellow British trade unionists arrive unannounced, working conditions are strikingly worse, with women machinists packed together, some gangways blocked by barefoot teenagers trimming thread-ends on the floor. </p> <p>Most child labourers have been cleared out of Bangladesh's export sector under international pressure, but several workers at Islam Garments, which supplies Wal-Mart and other western brand-name buyers, look barely 10 or 11 years old. </p> <p>Musammet is 18 and has worked at the factory for seven years. \"Of course I would have preferred to stay at school, but my family could not afford to send me,\" she tells the visiting British textile workers. Later, outside the factory, the workers are more open, reporting standard 12-hour days, one day's holiday a month, regular physical abuse by supervisors and compulsory overtime, sometimes through the night. </p> <p>Women garment workers in Dhaka are often raped or robbed as they leave work and factory fires have killed 400 workers in the sector over the past five years. </p> <p>The British textile industry is losing 2,000 jobs a week and it is mostly to factories such as Dressmen and Islam Garments that those jobs are going. Clothing imports have tripled in the past 15 years, overwhelmingly from the developing world, and now account for over half the clothes sold in Britain, as the big retailers and brand-name multinationals have switched production to cheap labour contractors in countries such as China, Indonesia, Morocco and Bangladesh. </p> <p>The same process is happening throughout western Europe, and while consumers have benefited from falling prices in real terms, the corporations and buyers - who dictate terms to producers in the developing world - have benefited far more from burgeoning mark-ups and arms-length control. </p> <p>The three British textile workers have come to Dhaka, courtesy of the charity War on Want, in an effort to build solidarity in the face of a global redivision of labour which is setting national workforces against each other in competition for orders. Ms Gale is senior shop steward at Jaeger Knitwear in Belper, owned by Coats Viyella, which has sold or closed factories employing thousands of workers in the past year, as its main buyer, Marks &amp; Spencer, switches to low-cost overseas production centres. Sandy Rankin, a GMB union activist, lost his job in December, when his Ayrshire knitting factory was closed by John Aird &amp; Co - and the machines were reportedly sold to China. Only Mike Gratton, union convenor at a Devon industrial fabrics factory, John Heathcoat, which has a specialist market, looks safe. </p> <p>The three activists hammer home the need to organise from the bottom up to win basic labour standards and better conditions. But building trade unionism in Bangladesh's mushrooming garments industry - of the kind that has proved effective in countries such as Sri Lanka, Thailand and Indonesia - is proving an uphill struggle. </p> <p>There are now 2m mostly women workers making clothes for export - compared with around 275,000 in Britain - working for 3,300 employers, plus another couple of million producing in what can be even worse conditions for the domestic market. </p> <p>But unions are legally registered in only 127 factories and fewer than a dozen employers actually negotiate with them. Workers are regularly sacked, beaten up or subjected to police fitups for being active in unions - two-thirds of Bangladesh's MPs directly or indirectly own garment factories - while an estimated 35% unemployment provides an army of willing substitutes ready to take their jobs. </p> <p>At the entrance to the giant South Korean-owned Dada factory in the tax-free export processing zone outside Dhaka, Nike and Tommy Hilfiger codes of conduct proclaim the companies' support for workers' right to free association, along with their opposition to child labour and enthusiasm for decent pay and working conditions. But the zone's general manager, Syed Nafizuddin Ahmed, is unequivocal. \"Trade unions are banned here,\" he says. </p> <p>Jobs inside the zone, where the average monthly wage is around 2,000 takas and conditions are often better than in the city factories, are highly coveted. But the employers take no chances with troublemakers. Rafiqul Islam Sujan organised a protest at one export processing zone factory over poor conditions and ended up having to bribe his way out of jail and change his name to get another job. </p> <p>In the Demra slum district of Dhaka, where tens of thousands are crammed together in flimsy shacks, between mud tracks awash with sewage and refuse, women from the garment factories and others describe to the British workers their struggle for survival without running water, electricity or health services. </p> <p>Faced with calls for better wages and conditions, Bangladeshi employers point to the demands for ever-lower prices by the western buyers. Lutfor Rahman, of the clothing exporters' association, cites the profits of companies such as Wal-Mart. \"They talk to us about ethics all the time, but will not share their profits. If they pay us more, we can also pay more\". </p> <p>Fahim Abdullah, director at the Dressmen factory, recalls an approach from a British company wanting uniforms for security guards for five and a half dollars a dozen. \"We simply couldn't do it at that price, but they got it elsewhere\". Bangladeshi manufacturers face the prospect of being undercut in turn by even lower-wage workforces in countries such as Vietnam, Burma, Cambodia and China. </p> <p>Both Bangladeshi and British union activists find little difficulty in pointing the finger at the multinational corporations who control the industry for their problems, rather than each other. </p> <p>\"Most textile workers at home blame the greed of the manufacturers and retailers,\" Mr Rankin says. \"If the general public in the west was confronted with what we have been in the last few days, they might start questioning the companies and demanding change. After what we've seen, anything you can do as a human being, you want to do.\"</p>",

There are now 2m mostly women workers making clothes for export - compared with around 275,000 in Britain - working for 3,300 employers, plus another couple of million producing in what can be even worse conditions for the domestic market. But unions are legally registered in only 127 factories and fewer than a dozen employers actually negotiate with them. Workers are regularly sacked, beaten up or subjected to police fitups for being active in unions - two-thirds of Bangladesh's MPs directly or indirectly own garment factories - while an estimated 35% unemployment provides an army of willing substitutes ready to take their jobs. At the entrance to the giant South Korean-owned Dada factory in the tax-free export processing zone outside Dhaka, Nike and Tommy Hilfiger codes of conduct proclaim the companies' support for workers' right to free association, along with their opposition to child labour and enthusiasm for decent pay and working conditions. But the zone's general manager, Syed Nafizuddin Ahmed, is unequivocal. \"Trade unions are banned here,\" he says. Jobs inside the zone, where the average monthly wage is around 2,000 takas and conditions are often better than in the city factories, are highly coveted. But the employers take no chances with troublemakers. Rafiqul Islam Sujan organised a protest at one export processing zone factory over poor conditions and ended up having to bribe his way out of jail and change his name to get another job. In the Demra slum district of Dhaka, where tens of thousands are crammed together in flimsy shacks, between mud tracks awash with sewage and refuse, women from the garment factories and others describe to the British workers their struggle for survival without running water, electricity or health services. Faced with calls for better wages and conditions, Bangladeshi employers point to the demands for ever-lower prices by the western buyers. Lutfor Rahman, of the clothing exporters' association, cites the profits of companies such as Wal-Mart. \"They talk to us about ethics all the time, but will not share their profits. If they pay us more, we can also pay more\". Fahim Abdullah, director at the Dressmen factory, recalls an approach from a British company wanting uniforms for security guards for five and a half dollars a dozen. \"We simply couldn't do it at that price, but they got it elsewhere\". Bangladeshi manufacturers face the prospect of being undercut in turn by even lower-wage workforces in countries such as Vietnam, Burma, Cambodia and China. Both Bangladeshi and British union activists find little difficulty in pointing the finger at the multinational corporations who control the industry for their problems, rather than each other. \"Most textile workers at home blame the greed of the manufacturers and retailers,\" Mr Rankin says. \"If the general public in the west was confronted with what we have been in the last few days, they might start questioning the companies and demanding change. After what we've seen, anything you can do as a human being, you want to do.\"",

And this is how I entered the exciting world of temping. </p> <p>The first week at a new job is always difficult. You have to ask where the loos are. You don't know where they keep the envelopes. But the most tiring thing is getting to know the employees. After seeing several different companies and offices, I have come to the conclusion that the thing that brings office staff together, the thing they all want and all moan about, is tea. Followed closely by milk. Or lack of it. Like the weather, talking about tea is therefore a very important thing for a temp to master. Tea also provides a nifty distraction from work. The excuse of having to do the daily mug wash or offering to make everyone in your office a cuppa (it's only polite after all) must take up a good hour a day. </p> <p>The main stumbling block in my new life as a temp, however, was not fitting in with the other staff, but something I found far more challenging: technology. It got to the point that I dreaded my boss saying, \"Just fax this for me will you?\" - a simple request maybe, but one that always ended in disaster, and sometimes violence. </p> <p>It's a complicated process sending faxes - which way up to put the paper, how to send a second page. I would approach the machine with caution, a sense of doom enveloping me at the sight of this evil piece of plastic. And I was justified. On one occasion I repeatedly tried to send my fax to the front desk as I didn't realise you needed to add a nine to the front of the number to get an outside line. While screaming, \"Why isn't it sending it?!\" at the machine, I got a call from the Margaret on reception asking me to stop tying up her phone lines. </p> <p>Once, I sent a fax six times as I couldn't tell whether or not the machine had sent it. Again, I got a phone call, the recipient of my fax asking whether I was trying to convey that this was particularly urgent and, if not, requesting that I please stop using up all his fax paper. Usually the vicious machine simply wouldn't send my boss's important memo, or worse still, chewed it up. Frequently, my encounter with the fax machine resulted in a nasty exchange of words/bleeps. </p> <p>The photocopier was another frightening piece of office equipment. Without fail, it jammed when the document I was photocopying was especially important. On occasion I have been known to flee when the machine stopped working in my presence and no one had witnessed. Nothing to do with me, honest guv. Then I'd go back later when someone else had fixed it. Even the telephone flummoxed me from time to time. \"Recall, star, star, three\" to transfer calls and \"recall plus your extension number\" to pick up other phones - or is it the other way around? I once tried to transfer a call from my boss's wife to my boss, only to lose her in transit. I now make a point of never saying my name when answering the phone so the caller won't know it was me who accidentally hung up on them. </p> <p>I'm not even going to mention the computer. </p> <p>With all this technological trauma, it was a lip-wobbling moment when my swipe card failed. Couldn't I even get that to work? No, instead I was forced to wait outside the office door after my trip to the cafe - cheese scone and individual portion of Flora margarine in hand - until Mick from IT walked past, chuckling at another temp left out in the corridor with a duff swipe card (It's a conspiracy, I say). </p> <p>My life as a temp was not suiting me well. </p> <p> <strong> Some months later ...</strong> </p> <p> I'd been there a few months and had turned temping into an art form.

This has its advantages. You aren't involved in the office politics and you hear the juicy gossip from all parties as no one feels you are biased or involved in any of the gossip yourself. You can take time off to go to interviews without giving notice. You can declare that you are not responsible for anything that goes wrong, on the basis that you are not fully informed as to how the office is run. The floating life of a temp, however, always switching departments, always at someone else's desk (whose assorted postcards and private jokes stuck to their pin-board can provide hours of amusement), and never being there long enough to learn all the names of the people you're introduced to, can leave you feeling like a bit of a spare part. </p> <p>While you may feel isolated and nomadic as a temp, one thing keeps a smile on your face - unlike all the permanent employees, you are free to scarper with one week's notice. One thing is certain - you will never be there long enough to become accustomed to the dull 9-to-5 routine that makes your life flash by in one monotonous cycle of getting up, going to work, and going to bed knackered. </p> <p>Or so you think. Until one day you find yourself watering the pot plants you got from Ikea to brighten up your desk, and the panic starts to rise. After a few weeks in the same office you realise that, regular as clockwork, you go down to the cafe at 11am for a muffin. You even know that Thelma the cafe manager is going through a nasty divorce as her husband slept with Maggie from reception.

But more scary than any of the above is the realisation that you actually know which compartment on the photocopier \"paper jam 13\" refers to. It's too late, you've become just like everyone else - the company has claimed your life. </p> <p>But just when you think you are doomed, a miracle occurs.

      "body": "<p>Gary Mitchell's new play, presented by 7:84 theatre company, is written from his own experience of working-class loyalism. Setting his drama on the July weekend of Orange marches, Mitchell is assured of a charged political backdrop, but what really motivates him is how this affects generations of the same family. </p> <p>What this means is a concentration on a claustrophobic domestic interior, with the violence outside represented only through sound. The details of family life are the dramatic landscape through which Mitchell reveals the changing face of loyalism. This has its limitations. While the personal consequences of the conflict are made clear (the grandfather has had minor heart attacks; the RUC officer son's marriage has broken up; the grandson is involved with paramilitaries), the crisis beyond the sitting room never feels real. </p> <p>More problematically, it repeats stock scenarios familiar from nationalist visions of the Troubles: the tragic maternal figure and the doomed romance between Scottish Johnny, over for the marches, and Lorraine. In his attempt to make the family's troubles universal, Mitchell throws away the chance to offer new insight into Protestant culture. </p> <p>There are some more promising elements. Mitchell is interested in the relationship between Scotland and Ulster, the influx of Scots for the marches. Just as Johnny is revealed to have a woefully limited understanding of the context he finds himself in, Lorraine, the granddaughter, shows her romanticised notion of the Scots-Ulster link. She hero-worshipped Johnny as she grew up, thinking him \"like Braveheart, only Protestant\". But this aspect of the play is at loggerheads with another central concern: the plight of the middle generation, the son in the RUC, having to enforce orders against his own community. But Mitchell doesn't develop his character deeply enough to hold the emotional centre of the play together.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Gary Mitchell's new play, presented by 7:84 theatre company, is written from his own experience of working-class loyalism. Setting his drama on the July weekend of Orange marches, Mitchell is assured of a charged political backdrop, but what really motivates him is how this affects generations of the same family. What this means is a concentration on a claustrophobic domestic interior, with the violence outside represented only through sound. The details of family life are the dramatic landscape through which Mitchell reveals the changing face of loyalism. This has its limitations. While the personal consequences of the conflict are made clear (the grandfather has had minor heart attacks; the RUC officer son's marriage has broken up; the grandson is involved with paramilitaries), the crisis beyond the sitting room never feels real. More problematically, it repeats stock scenarios familiar from nationalist visions of the Troubles: the tragic maternal figure and the doomed romance between Scottish Johnny, over for the marches, and Lorraine. In his attempt to make the family's troubles universal, Mitchell throws away the chance to offer new insight into Protestant culture. There are some more promising elements. Mitchell is interested in the relationship between Scotland and Ulster, the influx of Scots for the marches. Just as Johnny is revealed to have a woefully limited understanding of the context he finds himself in, Lorraine, the granddaughter, shows her romanticised notion of the Scots-Ulster link. She hero-worshipped Johnny as she grew up, thinking him \"like Braveheart, only Protestant\". But this aspect of the play is at loggerheads with another central concern: the plight of the middle generation, the son in the RUC, having to enforce orders against his own community. But Mitchell doesn't develop his character deeply enough to hold the emotional centre of the play together.",

      "body": "<p>Temp secretaries take note - regulations may not be your thing, but it's in your interest to be savvy about the temp-to-perm ones due to kick in this summer. They're part of the new Employment Agencies Regulations 2001, which will make sweeping changes to the recruitment landscape and affect you directly. </p> <p>The raison d'etre of the temp-to-perm regulations is to make it easier for temps to move from temporary to permanent work. That's how the argument ran in 1998 when the new Blair administration said that it planned to crack down on recruitment agencies in areas such as temp-to-perm \"transfer\" fees, timesheets, payments and references. </p> <p>A company currently has to pay transfer fees if it employs on a permanent basis any agency temp who is working for it. The government argued that these fees made employers reluctant to hire a competent temporary worker on a permanent basis, and it threatened to ban them. </p> <p>Recruiters were outraged - these fees are the bread and butter of some agencies - and the industry was not about to see its livelihood decimated. Months of intense lobbying followed, spearheaded by the Recruitment and Employment Confederation. The government made concessions. The result is the new Employment Agencies Regulations 2001, which will replace the current regs that have been in existence for 20 years. </p> <p>How will it work? The formula is complex, but put simply it will mean that once a temp has worked for an employer for 14 weeks, no temp-to-perm fee is payable. Alternatively, no fee is payable if an employer hires someone on a permanent basis eight weeks after that person has stopped temping at the company. </p> <p>How will the change affect temps? Adecco, one of the UK's largest recruitment agencies, is convinced that the regulations will do what the government intended. \"It'll be easier for temps to move into permanent work because the large fees that now make it uneconomical for the client won't be there,\" says Adecco's spokesman, Stuart Neill. </p> <p>These fees can run to as much as \u00a34,000 for a clerical worker, even when that temp has been in the job for a year, and even though the agency would have more than recouped the investment it made in attracting the temp, says Neill. He blamed agencies \"at the bottom end of the market\" for causing the problems. Large agencies operate differently, with charges made on a sliding scale, so the longer the temp works, the smaller the transfer fee. </p> <p>The TUC's view is that the government should have stuck to its guns and outlawed temp-to-perm fees. Their retention \"is likely to discourage employers from offering permanent jobs to temps,\" says Sarah Veale of the TUC. </p> <p>Victoria Wall, of Victoria Wall Associates, takes a different view. She thinks clients will merely sidestep the fees and go down the \"try before you buy\" route. </p> <p>It would work like this: a client seeking permanent staff may instead hire a temp. Over 14 weeks the client is able to assess the candidate to see if he or she is good at the job. Then, says Wall: \"The client can take the temp on with little risk and no recruitment fee. This would seriously affect the infrastructure of recruitment companies, as the temp division will become inundated with temp bookings, and the permanent division would slow down.\" </p> <p>As a result, temps will be \"courted\" by their agency. Agencies may \"incentivise\" their temps to work only for them, and may resort to \"persuasive practices\" to lure temps away from each other, or even the client, predicts Wall. Since agencies will be less likely to \"earn transfer fees out of their temps, they will be keen to maintain them as temps, even pulling them from bookings before they have the chance to become permanent,\" she says. </p> <p>The downside for those going from temp to perm is that they will have to work for the client for more than six months before becoming eligible for any benefits, according to Wall. This is because even though a temp may have worked for 14 weeks before being \"permed\", she is only able to start the official three-month probationary period once she's on board as a permanent employee. </p> <p>What about the impact of some of the other regulations? Temps can expect more detailed information from agencies in the contracts they receive, in a single document supplied within two working days and including details of whether it is an agency or a business. If the latter, they may be entitled to holiday pay and sick pay, says Belinda Avery, a lawyer at Pritchard Englefield. </p> <p>And, finally, perhaps the best news of all. Temps will still be paid even if the client hasn't paid the agency.</p>",

The raison d'etre of the temp-to-perm regulations is to make it easier for temps to move from temporary to permanent work. That's how the argument ran in 1998 when the new Blair administration said that it planned to crack down on recruitment agencies in areas such as temp-to-perm \"transfer\" fees, timesheets, payments and references. A company currently has to pay transfer fees if it employs on a permanent basis any agency temp who is working for it. The government argued that these fees made employers reluctant to hire a competent temporary worker on a permanent basis, and it threatened to ban them. Recruiters were outraged - these fees are the bread and butter of some agencies - and the industry was not about to see its livelihood decimated. Months of intense lobbying followed, spearheaded by the Recruitment and Employment Confederation. The government made concessions. The result is the new Employment Agencies Regulations 2001, which will replace the current regs that have been in existence for 20 years. How will it work? The formula is complex, but put simply it will mean that once a temp has worked for an employer for 14 weeks, no temp-to-perm fee is payable. Alternatively, no fee is payable if an employer hires someone on a permanent basis eight weeks after that person has stopped temping at the company. How will the change affect temps? Adecco, one of the UK's largest recruitment agencies, is convinced that the regulations will do what the government intended. \"It'll be easier for temps to move into permanent work because the large fees that now make it uneconomical for the client won't be there,\" says Adecco's spokesman, Stuart Neill. These fees can run to as much as \u00a34,000 for a clerical worker, even when that temp has been in the job for a year, and even though the agency would have more than recouped the investment it made in attracting the temp, says Neill. He blamed agencies \"at the bottom end of the market\" for causing the problems. Large agencies operate differently, with charges made on a sliding scale, so the longer the temp works, the smaller the transfer fee. The TUC's view is that the government should have stuck to its guns and outlawed temp-to-perm fees. Their retention \"is likely to discourage employers from offering permanent jobs to temps,\" says Sarah Veale of the TUC. Victoria Wall, of Victoria Wall Associates, takes a different view. She thinks clients will merely sidestep the fees and go down the \"try before you buy\" route. It would work like this: a client seeking permanent staff may instead hire a temp. Over 14 weeks the client is able to assess the candidate to see if he or she is good at the job. Then, says Wall: \"The client can take the temp on with little risk and no recruitment fee. This would seriously affect the infrastructure of recruitment companies, as the temp division will become inundated with temp bookings, and the permanent division would slow down.\" As a result, temps will be \"courted\" by their agency. Agencies may \"incentivise\" their temps to work only for them, and may resort to \"persuasive practices\" to lure temps away from each other, or even the client, predicts Wall. Since agencies will be less likely to \"earn transfer fees out of their temps, they will be keen to maintain them as temps, even pulling them from bookings before they have the chance to become permanent,\" she says. The downside for those going from temp to perm is that they will have to work for the client for more than six months before becoming eligible for any benefits, according to Wall. This is because even though a temp may have worked for 14 weeks before being \"permed\", she is only able to start the official three-month probationary period once she's on board as a permanent employee. What about the impact of some of the other regulations? Temps can expect more detailed information from agencies in the contracts they receive, in a single document supplied within two working days and including details of whether it is an agency or a business. If the latter, they may be entitled to holiday pay and sick pay, says Belinda Avery, a lawyer at Pritchard Englefield. And, finally, perhaps the best news of all. Temps will still be paid even if the client hasn't paid the agency.",

Begin and finish work at the same time every day and make sure you take an hour for lunch. </p> <p>\u0095 At lunchtime, when the weather's fine, go out for a walk or simply to sit in the sun.

Don't do household chores; you'll feel as if you haven't had a proper break. </p> <p>\u0095 If you can, designate a particular room in the house as your office. Set it up with a large desk, comfortable chair, plenty of shelving and a home-office computer. Install a dedicated telephone line, with a regularly updated answerphone message explaining your office hours and when you will next be at your desk. When you finish for the day, turn down the volume so you can't hear the phone ring, and shut the door. </p> <p>\u0095 Open an account with a discount stationery supplier.

Make sure you arrange to see friends or family at least a couple of evenings during the week, if not more, and sign up for new hobbies such as a Can't Sing Choir or Beginners' Watercolour evening class. Otherwise, you'll end up having manic attempts at chatting to the postman and brewing lakes of tea for stray Mori pollsters. </p> <p>As for me, well, my boyfriend is about to start working from home, too.

You'll need some pens and a notepad and maybe some smalltalk for lunchtime, when REFRESHMENTS ARE PROVIDED (WPM always gets a little overexcited when free refreshments are in the offing.

It's a new online delivery service, it says, which can collect your food from a choice of more than 300 restaurants, and will soon be spreading, rash-like, across the UK. </p> <p>WPM isn't sure about being able to choose from 300 menus. She has difficulty enough with one. But the point is that WPM would like to apologise, wholeheartedly, for failing urbanbite.com. Especially when it has concocted such a clever name for itself.

I think they should be encouraged, not least because they remove one or more of my colleagues from the office for a space of time, and hence out of my hair. </p> <p>The only time I don't like meetings is when they involve me. I'm sure if I was invited to meetings where I was allowed to sit and relax while people showed me interesting presentations, allowed me to speak for hours on my specialist subject, or offered me money, then I would positively embrace them. That's why Big Boss enjoys them so much. </p> <p>But I don't usually warrant a meeting - generally people just hover round my desk, or leave a Post-It with full instructions. And on the few occasions I have been deemed worthy of a proper meeting, with a proper meeting room, proper meeting notepads and proper meeting coffee, I have either been in trouble, or about to have my workload increased. Neither prospect fills me with joy. </p> <p>My colleagues, though, can't get enough of them. Which is why I had to spend a good day and a half last week arranging one for Lyndsey and one of our clients. Lyndsey decides she wants a meeting. When would she like it? She has no preference, her diary is clear, let the client decide. </p> <p>I call the client. When would suit them? Anytime is fine, I say. Lyndsey's diary is clear. Client isn't sure. Can they call me back? Cue lengthy pause during which client undergoes complicated internal negotiations, polar ice caps melt and galaxies form. Eventually, client provides list of dates and times that would suit. I tell Lyndsey. Ah. Of course, when Lyndsey said her diary was clear, what she actually meant was clear, apart from the day when she's leaving early, and the afternoon she needs clear to write that report, and, of course, the 101 things that were pencilled in while the client was getting his act together. Give me strength. </p> <p>The meeting was eventually arranged, you will be relieved to know, but for a date so far in the future that we are unsure if anyone will remember what it was for in the first place. Is it too early to buy my 2002 diary, or would that be asking for trouble? Big Boss isn't impressed. He thinks our time management skills need some work. He'd like us all to get together to discuss it. So if I could just arrange a time when everyone's free ...</p>",

      "bodyText": "Lots of people I know hate meetings. They think they're a bore, a chore, a downright hassle. I, on the other hand, have no problems with meetings. I think they should be encouraged, not least because they remove one or more of my colleagues from the office for a space of time, and hence out of my hair. The only time I don't like meetings is when they involve me. I'm sure if I was invited to meetings where I was allowed to sit and relax while people showed me interesting presentations, allowed me to speak for hours on my specialist subject, or offered me money, then I would positively embrace them. That's why Big Boss enjoys them so much. But I don't usually warrant a meeting - generally people just hover round my desk, or leave a Post-It with full instructions. And on the few occasions I have been deemed worthy of a proper meeting, with a proper meeting room, proper meeting notepads and proper meeting coffee, I have either been in trouble, or about to have my workload increased. Neither prospect fills me with joy. My colleagues, though, can't get enough of them. Which is why I had to spend a good day and a half last week arranging one for Lyndsey and one of our clients. Lyndsey decides she wants a meeting. When would she like it? She has no preference, her diary is clear, let the client decide. I call the client. When would suit them? Anytime is fine, I say. Lyndsey's diary is clear. Client isn't sure. Can they call me back? Cue lengthy pause during which client undergoes complicated internal negotiations, polar ice caps melt and galaxies form. Eventually, client provides list of dates and times that would suit. I tell Lyndsey. Ah. Of course, when Lyndsey said her diary was clear, what she actually meant was clear, apart from the day when she's leaving early, and the afternoon she needs clear to write that report, and, of course, the 101 things that were pencilled in while the client was getting his act together. Give me strength. The meeting was eventually arranged, you will be relieved to know, but for a date so far in the future that we are unsure if anyone will remember what it was for in the first place. Is it too early to buy my 2002 diary, or would that be asking for trouble? Big Boss isn't impressed. He thinks our time management skills need some work. He'd like us all to get together to discuss it. So if I could just arrange a time when everyone's free ...",

      "bodyText": "New research out today explains why British banks are putting so much effort into targeting the well-off. It reveals that the most lucrative 20% of customers generate substantially more profits than the entire bank. This top 20% produce up to 170% of a bank's profits and are covering the cost of servicing a substantial chunk of the rest of the customer base, much of which is unprofitable. The report, put together by KPMG Consulting and investment bank Goldman Sachs, shows the least profitable 20% of customers account for 80% of a typical bank's losses. A spokesman said the figures showed it was vital that retail banks focus on squeezing more value out of their existing customer bases. \"Those who fail to develop effective customer relationship management are likely to be targeted for acquisition by banks better able to exploit the customer base,\" concludes the report on the future of retail banking in Europe. Its publication follows the launch in Britain of a number of new banking ventures targeting the rapidly growing numbers of so-called \"mass affluents\" - the 4m people who have liquid assets of between \u00a330,000 and \u00a3200,000. Lloyds TSB, HSBC and Abbey National are among those that have launched or are planning wealth management operations aimed at their own, and other banks', well-off clients. The report comes amid continuing consolidation in the sector, with Germany's Dresdner Bank announcing a week ago that it had accepted a merger proposal from insurance group Allianz. The report reveals that if customers of a typical bank were ranked by profitability, the top 20% would generate up to 1.7 times more profit than the bank as a whole. The least profitable \"bottom 20%\" of a bank's customer base account for 80% of losses. The 60% of people who make up the majority range from \"mildly profitable\" at best to unprofitable. \"This distribution of profitability sets huge challenges for banks to meet,\" the report's authors said. \"The winners will be those retail banks that identify the most profitable customers, get hold of them through merger or acquisition, and then deploy effective and integrated customer relationship management to retain and fully exploit the customer assets they have acquired.\"",

His immediate thought is to load up a shotgun and seek violent retribution, but in the end is persuaded by Murphy that the best way to get back at rich people is to hit them where it hurts - in their wallets. </p> <p>Politicians in Europe have - metaphorically speaking - been looking for their shotguns since George Bush said that the US would not abide by its commitments under the Kyoto agreement on global warming. The president's view is that cutting emissions of greenhouse gases would be bad for the American economy. And in the president's scheme of things, the American economy comes first, second and third. The big polluters of corporate America have received a quick payback for all that campaign funding. </p> <p>Bush's repudiation of the Kyoto agreement has caused outrage in other countries, not because the Americans under Clinton were making great strides towards cutting carbon dioxide emissions (they weren't) but because Bush made it abundantly clear that he thought America's economic might meant that it could blow a big, fat raspberry at the rest of the world. A European Union mission was sent to Washington but, predictably enough, returned empty handed. </p> <p>But all is not lost. There is a way the rest of the world could respond effectively to this expression of American selfishness because it is the rest of the world that is bankrolling America's excessive consumption, which in part, is the reason for its high CO2 emissions. As can be seen from the first chart, US greenhouse gas emissions per capita are the highest in the developed world for any country other than Luxembourg. There are a number of reasons for this, including the fact that - as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development noted in its annual health check on the US last year - consumption of fossil fuels is encouraged by gasoline prices being too low. \"Automobile users probably do not pay their full external cost, even when climate change is ignored.\" </p> <p>So, with driving cheap and the economy growing rapidly, Americans have bought more cars and bigger cars over the past decade, along with vast quantities of other consumer goods. The consequences of all this over-consumption are highlighted by the second chart, which shows what has been happening to the US current account in recent years. </p> <p>The burgeoning deficit is clear evidence that America is living beyond its means. But the current account - broadly trade in goods and services - only makes up one half of a nation's balance of payments. The other half is the capital account, which shows whether a country is a net importer or a net exporter of capital, either in the form of direct investment in new plant or through the buying and selling of financial assets. Since the balance of payments should, by definition, balance, a deficit on the current account has to be matched by an equivalent surplus on the capital account. In reality, measurement problems mean that this does not always happen, but as the US current account has risen so it has increased its dependency on capital flows from the rest of the world. </p> <p>The amount it sucked in to finance its spending habit more than tripled from $113.3bn (\u00a378.7bn) in 1995 to $399.1bn last year as the current account headed towards the record deficit of $435.4bn in 2000. As such, savers in Germany and Japan are indirectly allowing American consumers to carry on polluting the planet at the current rate. This burden will become even heavier if Bush uses up the American budget surplus to finance his tax-cut plans, since at least under Clinton the failure of consumers to save was partly offset by the saving done for them by the government. </p> <p><strong> Severe consequences</strong><br> </p> <p>But the bottom line is that without the help of savers in the rest of the world, American consumers would have to consume less and save more, and the result of that would be a considerable slowdown in US growth. </p> <p>The policy implications of this should be quite clear, even to those rightwing ideologues who believe that America is entitled to do exactly what it wants. Bush is free to say that the US will break its Kyoto commitments, but the rest of the world is equally free to respond by cutting off the flow of funds to finance the US current account deficit. For Bush, the consequences would be far more severe than abiding by Kyoto, with an almighty crash on Wall Street and - as Robert McTeer, the president of the Dal las Federal Reserve admitted on Friday - a collapse in the value of the dollar. \"Capital inflows are holding the dollar up despite the negative tone of the current account deficit,\" Mr McTeer said, adding that for the moment the US remained an attractive place for the world's savers. \"If something should happen to cause them to lose faith, then there would be a problem and a dramatic downward pressure on the dollar.\" </p> <p>Of course, a deliberate attempt by Europe and Japan to stem the flow of capital to the US could be seen as a classic example of cutting off your nose to spite your face, because the impact of a sustained and deep American downturn would have knock-on effects on the rest of the world. But there are a number of points that need to be made. The first is that a day of reckoning is coming for the US sooner or later anyway. At some point, the days of live-now-pay-later will have to stop. A rebalancing of the global economy, with a smaller US current account deficit and a smaller Japanese current account surplus is much to be desired. </p> <p>The second point is that the Europeans and the Japanese would never need to make their threat explicit. A quiet word at a meeting of G7 finance ministers, backed up with a juicy non-attributable quote to the press would have the alarm bells ringing in the White House within five minutes. Third, while Tokyo might not want to see an appreciation of the yen against the dollar at a time when the Japanese economy is so weak, the Europeans would certainly like a stronger euro, which would facilitate lower interest rates and restore some pride after the single currency's battering since January 1999. Finally, the idea that the big financial institutions are a law unto themselves and would refuse to cooperate is a myth. French banks, for example, rarely say anything negative about the euro because it has been made clear that the ministry of finance finds such behaviour \"unhelpful\". </p> <p>Will this be contemplated? It depends of how serious the rest of the world is about global warming and how willing it is to stand up to the US. But let nobody say that there is nothing that could be done. There is. What's needed is a strike by European and Japanese capital. Get militant, comrades. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:larry.elliott@theguardian.com\">larry.elliott@theguardian.com</a></p>",

For Bush, the consequences would be far more severe than abiding by Kyoto, with an almighty crash on Wall Street and - as Robert McTeer, the president of the Dal las Federal Reserve admitted on Friday - a collapse in the value of the dollar. \"Capital inflows are holding the dollar up despite the negative tone of the current account deficit,\" Mr McTeer said, adding that for the moment the US remained an attractive place for the world's savers. \"If something should happen to cause them to lose faith, then there would be a problem and a dramatic downward pressure on the dollar.\" Of course, a deliberate attempt by Europe and Japan to stem the flow of capital to the US could be seen as a classic example of cutting off your nose to spite your face, because the impact of a sustained and deep American downturn would have knock-on effects on the rest of the world. But there are a number of points that need to be made. The first is that a day of reckoning is coming for the US sooner or later anyway. At some point, the days of live-now-pay-later will have to stop. A rebalancing of the global economy, with a smaller US current account deficit and a smaller Japanese current account surplus is much to be desired. The second point is that the Europeans and the Japanese would never need to make their threat explicit. A quiet word at a meeting of G7 finance ministers, backed up with a juicy non-attributable quote to the press would have the alarm bells ringing in the White House within five minutes. Third, while Tokyo might not want to see an appreciation of the yen against the dollar at a time when the Japanese economy is so weak, the Europeans would certainly like a stronger euro, which would facilitate lower interest rates and restore some pride after the single currency's battering since January 1999. Finally, the idea that the big financial institutions are a law unto themselves and would refuse to cooperate is a myth. French banks, for example, rarely say anything negative about the euro because it has been made clear that the ministry of finance finds such behaviour \"unhelpful\". Will this be contemplated? It depends of how serious the rest of the world is about global warming and how willing it is to stand up to the US. But let nobody say that there is nothing that could be done. There is. What's needed is a strike by European and Japanese capital. Get militant, comrades. larry.elliott@theguardian.com",

      "body": "<p><strong>Richard II</strong></p> <p><strong>Sam West, 34, plays Richard II. He is the son of Timothy West and Prunella Scales. He opens in Hamlet on 2 May </strong></p> <p>The RSC's millennium project, This England: the Histories, presents all eight of Shakespeare's history plays from Richard II to Richard III , with six Henrys in between. This week, for the first time in the company's history, we do them in chronological order over five days. I'm playing Richard II, so I've got the first line.</p> <p>Putting the histories together is a fat carrot at the end of the year-long season and it's a pleasure to discover that they've grown so much and so differently. The company is very strong and has made the journey together. It's hard to separate my thoughts about Richard from the decisions we've taken, but I am proud to be part of such a bold venture.</p> <p>The beginning of the new millennium is a good time to ask hard questions about this England, particularly as the questions haven't changed much in 400 years (I like to say I'm doing a play about the poll tax riots, the Irish question and who should succeed to my throne set in 1398). Charles and Camilla came to see Richard II in week two and it was fascinating, and very odd, to debate the problems of being a king in front of your next one. On meeting him backstage, all I could think of to say was: 'I hope we haven't put you off.'</p> <p>Richard is a king who defends his right to rule with spin and pride and only after his abdication does he come to terms with the existential terror of simply being alive. I see him as a leading man who realises that he's miscast and that only he can sack himself. He is not the man for the times; encouraged to bash the French in front of his French wife, he hears the word gun and reaches for his culture. But he is, I think, a man for our times, trying to make sense of his suspicion that hierarchy and title are nonsense. I hope this week's audiences start to question a system which gives individuals semi-divine status by virtue of their patronage and then turns them into scapegoats for their country's ills. George Bush, take note - the crown is poisoned and we kill our kings in the end.</p> <p>It's a good time to be at the RSC. The company celebrates its fortieth anniversary this year and might be forgiven for staging these plays on a raft of pride and pageantry. Instead, the directors have chosen stripped-down settings, which put the focus on the acting and give the political ideas room to expand. And it's good news for actors, though hard work.</p> <p>All eight productions are cross-cast. Predicting Northumberland's treachery is particularly satisfying when you know that Northumberland will act out your predictions in both parts of Henry IV the next day. David Troughton, who plays Bolingbroke, has the last line in Richard II and the first in Henry IV Part I. To date, he has done nine different endings to our play. He still throws in a different one occasionally to keep us on our toes. And this history cycle is written by the victors - when I heard Hotspur call Richard 'That sweet lovely rose', I had to stop myself jumping up from the audience and crying: 'Hang on - you never said that when I was alive.'</p> <p><strong>Henry IV</strong></p> <p><strong>David Troughton, 50, plays Bolingbroke in Richard II and becomes Henry IV for Parts I and II. He is the son of Patrick Troughton, the second Dr Who. </strong></p> <p>'The father-and-son theme of the plays is underlined for me because I open the first cycle of history plays, as Bolingbroke in Richard II, and my son Sam closes the second cycle in Henry VI. My father did not like stage acting. He didn't like the repetition and called it: \"All that shouting in the evenings.\"</p> <p>This is the best company I have ever been in. You can dispense with all those getting-to-know-you games. We had a mish-mash of ideas at the beginning, but the crown quickly became a metaphor for something a man wants but which will eventually kill him.</p> <p>'Richard II is my favourite, probably because you can politicise it. They are all different, of course, although a lot of the public will have wanted the history series all done in doublet and hose. We should not always give people what they want; that's what TV does.</p> <p>'Mike Attenborough, the director of Henry IV, is extremely good at telling a story simply. He doesn't bother with gadgets, he trusts the actors. He is relaxed enough to let the laughs happen in the right scenes and to lean on the clarity of the text.</p> <p>'When it comes to learning all the words, the brain is the most amazing thing. I don't know how we do it. Shakespearean actors learned several of the plays, but they did it in repertory. Luckily, the kings don't all stay on the stage as long as Richard III does. I think Burbage complained to Shakespeare after he wrote that one and so the other monarchs are given one act off.'</p> <p><strong>Henry V</strong></p> <p><strong>William Houston, 32, has been hailed as one of the young heroes of the RSC's history series. He grew up in Sussex and went to Central School of Speech and Drama.</strong></p> <p>'I have followed David Troughton's advice and I don't read the reviews. But if people are saying that these plays are good, it is because we've had the great advantage of rehearsing for a long time. In both parts of Henry IV , the director has trusted the actors to find their own voice. Mike hasn't come between the text and the actors at all. I think that is why the comedy has worked so well. Mind you, when you have experienced comic actors like Benjamin Whitrow and Peter Copley playing Justices Shallow and Silence, you can afford to relax. They are both ice-cool. It is extraordinary to see them before they go on.</p> <p>'Doing this series gives you a huge amount of respect for the crown. It is almost as if I am taking on the responsibility for carrying on with the cycle of plays from David. I have to change so much through the three plays, too. I do find it quite difficult to go back to doing Part I now. Prince Hal is hard to come back to after playing him as king.</p> <p>'It is a marathon, really. People who I haven't seen for a while say: \"My god, what has happened to your voice?\" I have aged around 12 years in one year. I would say that personally I have grown too and it has been a wonderful way to grow up. Talking about these ideas - that is what I love about Shakespeare, discussing the concept of what leadership really is.</p> <p>'I wish these productions could go on to another venue, but I honestly wonder if I am getting too old to play the part of the prince. I want to try film and television work now, I think. I want to find out more about that.</p> <p>' Henry V has been a different challenge. Ed Hall, the director, is only 33 and he has huge energy. His production is full of energy too and you are going to be lost against that set unless you are really powerful. It is a monster of a thing. There are so many bangs and clatters going on. But there are great imaginative compensations, such as the hanging of Bardolph, which is a terrific moment. The production gets an amazing reception from school parties, which is a great test.'</p> <p><strong>Henry VI</strong></p> <p><strong>David Oyelowo, 25, is the winner of this year's Ian Charleson Award for an outstanding performance given by an actor under 30. He plays Henry VI </strong></p> <p>'It has been an incredible experience, covering what amounts to 60 years of history. What's more, I play the same part all the way through.</p> <p>'I am going to be a father for the first time in October, so the theme of inheritance has been interesting. But I had a huge affinity with this part from the first because Henry VI is a Christian, as I am. His beliefs mean he is swimming against the tide and I often feel like that in the acting profession. So that sat very easily with me. People make a lot of mistakes with Henry VI. It is too easy to dismiss him as a John the Baptist-style nutter. But if he is portrayed as ineffectual, then you miss the conflict and the contrast with everyone else at court, who is interested in power and in family trees. The plays went down a storm in the US. They think Shakespeare is other- worldly, so the fact that the RSC was coming out there to do it was amazing to them.</p> <p>'Learning the script has not been that difficult. It is like being an athlete. You get much better by just doing it. And good writing is very easy to learn. In fact, you can't wait to get up there and start speaking the lines. When we do all the parts in one day it is quite tricky though. Twelve hours of concentration takes it out of you. You crash out afterwards. You have to acknowledge that you have put your body through something quite devastating.</p> <p>'It is very different for an audience too. We rarely apply our attention to anything for more than two or three hours, so about six hours in to the series, the audience shifts mood.</p> <p>'I have made a leap in my acting with this part that other actors have to make over years. It is just that Shakespeare makes you fearless.'</p> <p><strong>Richard III</strong></p> <p><strong>Aidan McArdle, 30, plays Richard III. He is from Dublin and went to Rada before joining the Abbey Theatre. He was a member of last season's RSC company and played Puck in Michael Boyd's A Midsummer Night's Dream</strong></p> <p>'It is almost like finding yourself in some sort of sprint relay with the Linford Christies of this world. I felt like that before I started rehearsing, when I went to see the other plays in Stratford. It was terrifying because the others were so good.</p> <p>'I do think Richard is utterly lost as a man, but he knows that he is. He has made a kind of Faustian pact and, to a certain extent, he is getting his own back and shaking his fist at the world. It is a decision Richard takes to be evil and to do as much damage as possible. He hides behind the idea of retribution. He is the third brother and the runty one and when you see Henry VI first, you can see just how far away he is from power at the beginning.</p> <p>'After the regicide, Richard is capable of doing anything. He goes from wondering: \"Will I really do all that I think I could?\" to being quite sure that he is damned. Richard is dealing with a problem and establishing for himself a whole bridge. He believes that everyone is utilitarian. So, actually, he is quite shaken when he is forgiven at the end of Henry VI Part III, because that kind of forgiveness does not fit into his world view.</p> <p>'These histories are about character and plot, not time, so it doesn't matter when they are set. Our director has made a virtue of the repeated themes and roles within the plays.</p> <p>'When it came to learning the words, you just do it. The words are the engine of the whole drama, so they're not difficult to learn. It is a feat of memory, but it doesn't feel like that. You are so much more eloquent in Shakespeare; every character is.'</p> <p><strong>All the kings' men...</strong></p> <p>Audiences attending the entire cycle will see almost 24 hours of theatre, 1,413 minutes of Shakespeare </p> <p>More than 400 costumes and 200 pairs of shoes and boots are used during the eight plays, plus five severed heads; more than 50 swords and 10 pints of stage blood</p> <p>79 actors play 264 roles</p> <p>David Oyelowo is the first black actor to play an English monarch in an RSC production</p> <p>Strictly speaking, there are seven kings: apart from the kings described here, there is Edward III, who is the subject of a play recently attributed to Shakespeare.

      "body": "<p>The first three months of pregnancy almost invariably consist of 12 weeks of nausea and exhaustion. That's how it has been for me. I slept whenever I could see a clear 10 minutes. The range of palatable foods narrowed until it mainly involved toast and Marmite. I spent my evenings reading magazines, or out pretending to drink. And I went to New York for two frivolous days. </p> <p>When my friend Lisa invited me on a cheap trip, I agreed straight away. It wasn't necessarily sensible, but I love New York and I was starting to feel better. We agreed to take it slowly, and concentrate on art rather than shopping. It helped that we were staying in the Waldorf Astoria. </p> <p>Doctors recommend that any travelling should be done in the second three months. As the authors of What to Expect When You're Expecting point out: 'With no nappies, no bottles, no jars of messy baby food to worry about, it'll never be as easy to vacation again.' </p> <p>Apparently, the final three months are not only uncomfortable, but there is a slight risk the baby will decide to put in an appearance on the plane. For this reason, most airlines require a doctor's letter before they'll carry anyone more than 28 weeks pregnant. </p> <p>When we checked in, I asked for extra leg room. 'I've got two seats by the emergency exit,' smiled the woman. Airlines are not supposed to put pregnant women there, but a message that I was pregnant hadn't got through, and no one asked. On the way back we were seated by the bulkhead. In both cases I could straighten my legs without meeting an obstacle. It hardly felt like travelling in economy, particularly when, in the absence of the vegetarian meal I had asked for, I was brought food from first class instead. </p> <p>When I told my GP I planned to cross the Atlantic, she advised: 'Get up and walk around every hour, and drink lots and lots of water.' The two, I discovered, go hand in hand. Trips to the toilet were frequent. </p> <p>The other crucial piece of advice is to take it easy once you get there. New York is not renowned as The City That Takes An After noon Nap, but we were helped by our ineptitude. We walked to the Metropolitan Museum only to find it closes on Mondays.

      "bodyText": "The first three months of pregnancy almost invariably consist of 12 weeks of nausea and exhaustion. That's how it has been for me. I slept whenever I could see a clear 10 minutes. The range of palatable foods narrowed until it mainly involved toast and Marmite. I spent my evenings reading magazines, or out pretending to drink. And I went to New York for two frivolous days. When my friend Lisa invited me on a cheap trip, I agreed straight away. It wasn't necessarily sensible, but I love New York and I was starting to feel better. We agreed to take it slowly, and concentrate on art rather than shopping. It helped that we were staying in the Waldorf Astoria. Doctors recommend that any travelling should be done in the second three months. As the authors of What to Expect When You're Expecting point out: 'With no nappies, no bottles, no jars of messy baby food to worry about, it'll never be as easy to vacation again.' Apparently, the final three months are not only uncomfortable, but there is a slight risk the baby will decide to put in an appearance on the plane. For this reason, most airlines require a doctor's letter before they'll carry anyone more than 28 weeks pregnant. When we checked in, I asked for extra leg room. 'I've got two seats by the emergency exit,' smiled the woman. Airlines are not supposed to put pregnant women there, but a message that I was pregnant hadn't got through, and no one asked. On the way back we were seated by the bulkhead. In both cases I could straighten my legs without meeting an obstacle. It hardly felt like travelling in economy, particularly when, in the absence of the vegetarian meal I had asked for, I was brought food from first class instead. When I told my GP I planned to cross the Atlantic, she advised: 'Get up and walk around every hour, and drink lots and lots of water.' The two, I discovered, go hand in hand. Trips to the toilet were frequent. The other crucial piece of advice is to take it easy once you get there. New York is not renowned as The City That Takes An After noon Nap, but we were helped by our ineptitude. We walked to the Metropolitan Museum only to find it closes on Mondays. We attempted a two-hour ferry trip around Manhattan in freezing wind and imminent snow, only to miss it by seconds because we'd spent too long over the last cup of tea. The following day we did better, but towards the end of both afternoons my body let me know in no uncertain terms that it was time to stop, though it was no hardship. In fact, I enjoyed the weekend so much that, as my partner is going on a work trip before Easter, Lisa and I are to go on a proper holiday, this time to Cyprus. We plan to do little more than read books and soak up some sun. It may be my last chance for years to go on a normal, self-centred holiday. \u0095 'What to Expect When You're Expecting,' by Eisenberg, Murkoff and Hathaway, Simon &amp; Schuster, \u00a311.99.",

His method of writing about low-life in a high style, his blokey banter and cool, languorous wit, his ironic fascination with the junk and trash of contemporary culture mean that, for better or worse, he remains the commanding presence of British fiction, the one the new literary lads jostle to imitate, the writer-as-celebrity, the main man. </p> <p>Conrad famously said that any work aspiring to the condition of art must carry its justification in every line. In this sense and this sense only, Amis's prose has a Conradian urgency: he has always been aggressively competitive, seeking to invent his own idiom and discover daring new ways of writing about the modern world. </p> <p>'I don't want to write a sentence that any guy could have written,' he once said - and only a writer as anxiously self-evaluating as Amis would have called his new book The War Against Clich\u00e9, a title that, at once, seeks to elevate (himself) and to challenge (others). Look at my words and despair, he seems to say: you won't find any ready-made formulation between these hard covers, nothing ordinary, banal or commonplace. So Amis is a self-styled gladiator of language, a warrior of words in daily battle against the forces of mediocrity, as represented by the journalist, the genre writer, the hack biographer and the instant opinion merchant, all of whom he remorselessly slays in this book, until there is nothing left but their words: bad words, clich\u00e9d words. </p> <p>But an essential loneliness underscores his quest for absolute originality. So much of what he says and does is motivated by the same questions: What am I worth? How good am I? In one of the essays he suggests that the canon, in which he is steeped as a reader and of which he so longs to be a part, is exclusively the work of writers in early middle-age, from which he has passed. Does this mean that Amis has written his best book; that with the publication first of his memoir, Experience, last year, and now this collection, he is taking one last, long, lingering backward glance at the showman he once was before entering a phase that, tentatively, we can already describe as Late Amis? </p> <p>If so, Late Amis, judging from Night Train (1997) - his noir-ish novella about a murder investigation without a murderer - and Experience, seems set to be characterised by a peculiarly sombre music, a darkening of mood and tone, a tauter, more controlled artistry and by a diminished desire for cruelty and self-enthronement. In an essay on Saul Bellow, first collected in The Moronic Inferno but not republished here, Amis argued that Bellow wrote in a style fit for heroes: the High Style. </p> <p>'To evolve an exalted voice appropriate to the twentieth century has been the self-imposed challenge of his work. The High Style attempts to speak for the whole of mankind, to remind us of what we once knew and have since forgotten. \"It was especially important,\" [Bellow writes], \"to think what a human being really was.\" '</p> <p>Does Amis write in a style fit for heroes? Well, he is pre-eminently a prose surrealist: he distorts and parodies as reality is heightened and mangled by comedy. The twin engines of his work are inversion and paradox; he thrives on opposites, polarities, thrilling reversals. And there is something heroic about his attempt to evolve his own exalted voice. But, unlike Bellow's, his fiction has little philosophical or ethical rigour; he hasn't, you feel, really thought hard enough about what a human being really is.</p> <p>What Amis is, in essence, is a turbocharged cartoonist; no matter how hard he struggles to import seriousness into his work - through writing about the nuclear threat, the Holocaust, Fred West or the new physics - his characters remain trapped between two sets of inverted commas, for ever destined to be lost in the monotonous sublime of caricature, mere puppets controlled by a master who never allows you to forget that you are in the grip of his superior, knowing intelligence. </p> <p>Which means, in many ways, Amis destabilises his own best instincts: no one reading this book can doubt his immense verbal gifts, his wit and insight. Nor, reading Experience, can they doubt his boundless capacity for empathy and love - for family and friends, for the writing life itself that he dignifies as a heroic activity. And yet he remains a resolutely more impressive essayist than novelist. Compared with, say, Philip Roth, who is embarked on a similar mission to recast the modern world in fiction, he is a mere baggage-handler of literature. </p> <p>Reading Roth's recent trilogy of novels about the corruption of postwar American society and Sabbath's Theater before that, you sense that here is a writer, even at the age of 67, who burns to invent. As a result, his fiction has a peculiar moral resonance, an existential frenzy of the kind that is entirely absent from Amis's work, with its wised-up patter and easy grotesques. </p> <p>The more you read of Late Roth, the more you are convinced he is writing against extinction, that he works to the sound of death panting behind him, feels its cankerous breath on his neck. Equally, the more you read of Roth the more you realise that Amis is wrong about the canon being the work of writers in early middle-age - because Roth is producing canonical work late in life. </p> <p>Can Amis - changed by the death of his father and humbled by experience - do the same?

In the Rockies and further west in the US with falls of up to 25cm, sunny days have made for pleasant skiing but melting lower pistes. The East has had large falls of late snow, up to 60cm. </p> <p><strong>Andorra:</strong> Sunny skiing, best in the mornings on higher slopes. Soldeu (50cm lower slopes and 130cm upper) and Pas de la Casa (55/85cm) both had some fresh snow last week. </p> <p><strong>Austria:</strong> Mayrhofen (0/130cm) is still good on piste while off-piste is spring snow. Kitzbuhel (0/60cm) was 'deteriorating rapidly' with slushy pistes. St Anton (25/300cm) was best above mid-station. Saalbach-Hinterglemm (0/50cm) was only 'fair'. Obergurgl (50/200cm) after fresh snow had excellent higher pistes and skiable lower ones. Conditions were excellent at Kaprun (138/348cm) with off-piste powder. </p> <p><strong>Canada:</strong> Whistler (80/210cm) - 31cm of new snow in seven days. In Alberta, Lake Louise (100/150cm) was doing well after new snow. </p> <p><strong>France:</strong> Val d'Isere (64/330cm) was busy with sunny weather midweek though conditions were 'expected to worsen'. Pistes were good at the top but poor lower down. Conditions have improved in the Three Valleys. Courchevel (68/150cm) midweek, had been mainly cloudy but with some sun expected. At M\u00e9ribel (10/135cm) pistes are good. Val Thorens (80/200cm) had good piste skiing and was 'packed' off-piste. La Plagne (110/360cm) had more snow last weekend and pistes are open with best conditions on north-facing slopes. Chamonix (10/205cm) had good upper slopes but they become soft as the day goes on. </p> <p><strong>Italy:</strong> Courmayeur (40/350cm) and Cervinia (140/250cm) are best above the mid-station. Cortina (30/250cm) is incredible higher up for the time of year. Selva (5/220cm) still has reasonable skiing above mid-station. Sauze d'Oulx (50/150cm) was reported as excellent on and off-piste. Bormio (95/260cm) had fair pistes and packed off-piste. </p> <p><strong>Norway:</strong> Geilo (90/110cm), Lillehammer (40/110cm), and Hemesdal (120/190cm) all have good skiing. </p> <p><strong>Spain:</strong> Europe's most southerly resort, Sierra Nevada (80/250cm) still has good piste skiing. </p> <p><strong>Switzerland:</strong> South-facing Crans-Montana (0/170cm) softens up fast each day and conditions are only fair. There's still good snow at Davos (40/220cm) and Murren (20/100cm), though lower runs are shut. St Moritz (150/300cm) still has good piste skiing. Verbier (5/240cm) is 'good for the time of year'. Zermatt (still 10/220cm) had hard runs turning slushy in the afternoons. </p> <p><strong>US:</strong> Aspen (119/167cm) was excellent higher up but slushy lower down. There was good skiing on and off-piste. Vail (139/286cm) was enjoying excellent conditions. Sunshine at Heavenly (60/150cm) has meant conditions are enjoyable but only 'fair' while Mammoth (165/195cm) is excellent with 'great' skiing all over.

      "bodyText": "There were some good snowfalls over the Alps, but warm days and cloudy nights are taking their toll on the slopes, which are at their best higher up, facing north and before lunch. In the Rockies and further west in the US with falls of up to 25cm, sunny days have made for pleasant skiing but melting lower pistes. The East has had large falls of late snow, up to 60cm. Andorra: Sunny skiing, best in the mornings on higher slopes. Soldeu (50cm lower slopes and 130cm upper) and Pas de la Casa (55/85cm) both had some fresh snow last week. Austria: Mayrhofen (0/130cm) is still good on piste while off-piste is spring snow. Kitzbuhel (0/60cm) was 'deteriorating rapidly' with slushy pistes. St Anton (25/300cm) was best above mid-station. Saalbach-Hinterglemm (0/50cm) was only 'fair'. Obergurgl (50/200cm) after fresh snow had excellent higher pistes and skiable lower ones. Conditions were excellent at Kaprun (138/348cm) with off-piste powder. Canada: Whistler (80/210cm) - 31cm of new snow in seven days. In Alberta, Lake Louise (100/150cm) was doing well after new snow. France: Val d'Isere (64/330cm) was busy with sunny weather midweek though conditions were 'expected to worsen'. Pistes were good at the top but poor lower down. Conditions have improved in the Three Valleys. Courchevel (68/150cm) midweek, had been mainly cloudy but with some sun expected. At M\u00e9ribel (10/135cm) pistes are good. Val Thorens (80/200cm) had good piste skiing and was 'packed' off-piste. La Plagne (110/360cm) had more snow last weekend and pistes are open with best conditions on north-facing slopes. Chamonix (10/205cm) had good upper slopes but they become soft as the day goes on. Italy: Courmayeur (40/350cm) and Cervinia (140/250cm) are best above the mid-station. Cortina (30/250cm) is incredible higher up for the time of year. Selva (5/220cm) still has reasonable skiing above mid-station. Sauze d'Oulx (50/150cm) was reported as excellent on and off-piste. Bormio (95/260cm) had fair pistes and packed off-piste. Norway: Geilo (90/110cm), Lillehammer (40/110cm), and Hemesdal (120/190cm) all have good skiing. Spain: Europe's most southerly resort, Sierra Nevada (80/250cm) still has good piste skiing. Switzerland: South-facing Crans-Montana (0/170cm) softens up fast each day and conditions are only fair. There's still good snow at Davos (40/220cm) and Murren (20/100cm), though lower runs are shut. St Moritz (150/300cm) still has good piste skiing. Verbier (5/240cm) is 'good for the time of year'. Zermatt (still 10/220cm) had hard runs turning slushy in the afternoons. US: Aspen (119/167cm) was excellent higher up but slushy lower down. There was good skiing on and off-piste. Vail (139/286cm) was enjoying excellent conditions. Sunshine at Heavenly (60/150cm) has meant conditions are enjoyable but only 'fair' while Mammoth (165/195cm) is excellent with 'great' skiing all over. In the East, Killington (135/235cm) after more snow had excellent pistes. Sunday River (175/250cm) had good trails, varied conditions off them. On the slopes: Farrah Fawcett was in Aspen, Colorado and Bo Derek just down the road in Snowmass.

She is thought to have already run up a bill of around \u00a320,000, but for the moment, home is wherever she lays her gym kit, and it comes complete with mini-bar, butler and in-house entertainment. </p> <p>Halliwell is not the only star to live in a hotel. Her former flame Chris Evans lived for three months in the Langham Hilton, as did Gloria Gaynor (not together, we hasten to add); Ruud Gullit checked into Newcastle's Malmaison for the two years he was managing United, while actor Richard Harris still uses the Savoy as his London home. Johnny Depp and Tina Turner both spent months at the Portobello in Notting Hill - it's claimed the singer liked it so much she bought the house next door. </p> <p>Further back in the mists of time, Peter Sellers met Britt Ekland while living at the Dorchester, where fellow long-stayers included Richard Burton and Liz Taylor. In the Thirties, Marlene Dietrich spent three years in the lilac-coloured Suite 45 of the Hotel Lancaster in Paris, while Greta Garbo was 'discovered' performing in the lounge of the Fairmont Miramar, the Los Angeles hotel where she stayed for four years, which also was home to Jean Harlow and Marilyn Monroe. And Richard Nixon launched his successful 1968 presidential campaign from his home, New York's Pierre Hotel, where Aristotle and Jackie Onassis were neighbours. </p> <p>Clearly celebrities don't fret too much about the bill - but even with a discount, a two-month stay can easily run into five figures. So why do people opt to live in hotel suites? </p> <p>'These people are often seasoned travellers who are looking for something that is more like a house than a hotel,' says Pam Carter, PR manager of London's Connaught Hotel, which has several long-stay, non-celebrity guests. 'It might sound a glamorous life, but they want something that offers a little bit of home.' </p> <p>It's the same approach at the Portobello - only with a less formal, rock'n'roll twist. 'It's like their place, rather than ours,' says Johnny Ekperigin, a managing partner. 'They get left alone, they're not treated like stars. We do whatever's appropriate for hoteliers - we give them a key, we're open 24 hours, we feed them when they want - but we're not flunkeys. Staying here is like staying at the house of an eccentric aunt.' </p> <p>But, of course, if you invite a superstar to treat your hotel like a home, they check in along with their egos, quirks and foibles. Alice Cooper used to keep his pet boa constrictor in the bath of his Portobello room, leaving instructions and a \u00a35 note for staff to buy a mouse for its supper at the local pet shop. </p> <p>Years later, when a young Hollywood star was living in the same building, he allegedly filled the bath with champagne to take a dip with his supermodel girlfriend. They left the room for a short time and returned to find the maid had emptied the 'dirty water'. The Portobello also provided a bolthole for Michael Hutchence and Paula Yates when they first got together in the mid-Nineties. 'They hardly left their room for two months,' recalls Ekperigin. 'All we saw was their shoes outside the room - he had a lovely pair of Patrick Cox imitation crocodiles.' </p> <p>Even more surreal was Salvador Dal\u00ed, who spent at least a month every year at the Hotel Meurice in Paris. Not only did the artist demand a flock of sheep be brought to the room (he then took pot shots at them with a pistol loaded with blanks), but he also requested room service to fetch him a horse and paid staff to catch flies, giving them five francs per insect. </p> <p>But the undisputed king of the ludicrous request was Howard Hughes. When living in Bungalow Four of the Beverly Hills Hotel, he had his regular roast beef sandwiches left in the fork of a nearby tree. When he moved to the Desert Inn in Las Vegas in 1966 he took over the whole hotel, living on the ninth floor and keeping the eighth totally empty for four years. He stored all his urine in jars and had a transfusion of Mormon blood. He also cancelled the hotel's traditional Easter-egg hunt (he loathed children), as well as its pro-golf tournament, offended at the prospect of golfers entering his property after putting their hands in dirty holes. </p> <p>It's not just celebrities who opt to live in hotels. Wealthy widow Enid Stannard, who was the inspiration for the novel Lady Carlton, moved into the Carlton in Cannes in the early Sixties, staying in Room 346 until her death 34 years later. The Dorchester had a guest who lived there for 25 years until 1989. He would pay cash religiously each week, never failing to argue over items on the bill. </p> <p>Less enduring but almost as legendary was Jeff Max, an American internet consultant who checked into London's Halkin hotel for four days in 1998. As the dotcom revolution unfolded, his services were constantly in demand. He eventually checked out - 261 days later. </p> <p>Most live-ins will do so for months rather than years, but London's Connaught aims to create a unique home environment for the long-stay resident. They keep a comprehensive personal guest history and will make the necessary changes accordingly: the bed, the pictures on the wall, the contents of the mini bar, even altering the bathroom taps for one hygiene-conscious regular. </p> <p>'For one guest we have a list of 100 changes we make before they arrive,' says Pam Carter. 'And we have another who commutes across continents. We keep a whole London wardrobe for him, pressed and ready to go. When he checks out after a long stay all he has is hand luggage.' The Four Seasons operates a 'Call Us Home' programme at selected properties for guests staying more than 14 days. With personalised menus, business facilities and a daily routine, including a school run if needed, worked out with the concierge, it claims to create a home away from home. </p> <p>But perhaps the most famous hotel in the world for long-stay guests has no links with an international chain. The Chelsea in New York has been home to Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller, who both wrote plays while living there; Arthur C. Clarke, is said to have written 2001: A Space Odyssey during his stay there, and Jack Kerouac, who, according to legend, typed On the Road on a single roll of paper in one marathon session, was also a resident. </p> <p>Other members of the live-in literati include Allen Ginsberg, Dylan Thomas, Tom Wolfe and Brendan Behan, while several painters found inspiration there, including David Hockney. Leonard Cohen and Joni Mitchell both wrote songs during their stays. </p> <p>'All these people became my friends,' says Stanley Bard, director of the Chelsea for more than 40 years. 'It's not your normal tenant-landlord relationship. </p> <p>'Everyone knows about us. Artists and writers come for a couple of months or years and hope to become famous. It's said there are ghosts or mysteries in the walls. People feel comfortable here; it's a creative environment.' </p> <p>It certainly seems to work for painter George Chenesche. He arrived for a week and has lived there 25 years, marrying, divorcing and becoming a father under the Chelsea's roof. </p> <p>However, while still going strong in New York, the days of the long-term residency, at least for celebrities, may be numbered at British hotels. The rise of the discreet, serviced apartment block, such as Monarch House, which has been used by Tom Hanks and Leonardo Di Caprio, and Circus, both run by the Metropolitan Hotel, or the Portobello's own apartments, could be the way ahead. 'More and more hotels are opening them,' says Ekperigin. </p> <p>'People staying for a long time want to do their own thing, to come and go as they want and not to be seen. You can't really do that in a hotel.' So as Geri Halliwell clutches her bottle of mineral water and heads for the gym, she may well ponder her role as one of a dying breed - the last of the hotel-dwelling stars.</p>",

      "body": "<p>You get to the airport late, rush through check-in and passport control and then just as you're easing into your minuscule seat for a 12-hour trip, you remember something. You forgot to stop by W.H. Smith for a bonkbuster and a real magazine. Now you are trapped with nothing but a few peanuts and an in-flight magazine for amusement. </p> <p>Few reading experiences can be less pleasurable, unless you are flying Virgin Atlantic or British Airways, which have long taken their magazines seriously, offering plenty of stuff you really want to read. This month they have both revamped their offerings, making them even more readable and putting them even further ahead of the pack. </p> <p>Here we review the improved versions, plus a handful of the competition which, unfortunately, is lagging behind woefully. </p> <p> <strong> British Airways: Highlife</strong> <br> <strong> Rating:</strong> 4/5 </p> <p> Put Jude Law on the cover and few women can fail to flick further. 'The real me is the person at home eating toast,' he says. A quick turn to page 50 delivers more steamy pictures and a pacey read to match. The magazine seems to have a younger, more stylish feel than before - a little bit of a Wallpapery influence shows up in the typeface and design. There are lots of small items to browse - tips on shopping (Jetset musts include Berluti shoes), cool hotels and celebs such as Vivienne Westwood. The main offputting thing is the over-abundance of advertisements and junk stapled inside, which makes flicking the thing difficult. Will Self's feature on Walking Britain in a Day, written before the foot and mouth epidemic, was a typical example of magazine deadlines clashing with more up to date events.</p> <p> <strong> BA: Business Life</strong><br> <strong> Rating:</strong> 4/5</p> <p> Sex and money are always guaranteed to draw the readers in. BA has managed to combine both in a front cover shot of Madonna pitching an article inside on her multi-million pound business empire. Sharp designs and witty writing mix with indulgent reviews of fast cars, consumer gadgets and a half-page eulogy of the Cuban cigar. This redesigned magazine for the business traveller is something you'd definitely want to take off the plane.</p> <p> <strong> Virgin Atlantic: Hot Air </strong> <br> <strong> Rating:</strong> 4/5</p> <p> The front cover photograph looking up Angelina Jolie's nostrils gets you interested, but the words are confusingly run together: 'Audley Harrison Planet Of The Apes Daft Punk The Rebirth of Berlin Subbuteo Streakers'. God knows how a non-English speaker would cope, and the inside is terrifyingly trendy. </p> <p>It's big on architecture and design, with Berlin and Guggenheim making appearances, and it feels like a real magazine, rather than a freebie. It's beautifully laid out, advertisements blend in rather than clash, and it is printed on rich matt paper. </p> <p>This is one of the few airline mags you'd want to take home. There are lots of snippets about hotels, or things to see, which are worth cutting out. Only criticism is it's a bit top heavy on boys' toys - golf, football, Lego, cars, tigers, trainers and travel gear (but that's not surprising really as it's edited by former Arena editor Ekow Eshun). </p> <p>We'd have liked a bit more on handbags, but maybe we'll have to wait till the next issue for that. </p> <p> <strong> Icelandair - Iceland Review</strong> <br><strong> Rating:</strong> 1/5</p> <p> The dark cover of a man with overgrown eyebrows peeping from the shadows is gloomy and depressing, and its headline, 'Solitary farming', doesn't set the pulse racing. </p> <p>The typeface and layout are clean and modern, but rather static throughout. The features are worthy and dull. How about 'Icelandic chess has a multifarious nature...' Even the apparently promising feature on erotic clubs in Reykjavik reads like a local authority newsletter. It tells us: 'Currently serving her second term as the democratically-elected major of Reykjavik, Ingibjorg Solrun Gisladottir, voices her concern over the number of erotic clubs operating in the capital area.'</p> <p> <strong> American Airlines: American Way</strong> <br><strong> Rating:</strong> 0/5 </p> <p> It's a big struggle to get past the front page. Printing all the words in capital letters is guaranteed to make you go cross-eyed. The inside is packed thick with cardboard advertising inserts and bits of paper selling phone cards and frequent flyer memberships. We can't find anything else of interest to read, and wonder, who on earth is this for?</p> <p> <strong> Cathay Pacific: Discovery</strong> <br><strong> Rating: </strong> 2/5</p> <p> There's nothing Zeitgeist about this magazine. A cover story on the Tate Modern turns out to be a rather dull overview of the building's history and its art. The layout of the piece is dated and boring. Some impressive photography of Angkor Wat makes up for another rather lifeless article. </p> <p>Rather bizarrely, the picture captions are bilingual, but the rest of the articles are in English. Perhaps the Hong Kong Chinese only look at the pictures? Not something you'd want to take home with you. </p> <p> <strong> Qantas: The Australian Way</strong> <br><strong> Rating:</strong> 3/5</p> <p> A dark picture of a Qantas aircraft is a poor choice of cover picture for an interesting in-flight fashion shoot feature. Few plugs for this Australian carrier's own products make this a more refreshing read, but the editorial fails to stand out from its rivals. Canadian novelist Margaret Atwood spices things up when she waxes lyrical about her home city, Toronto, but the rest is pretty standard stuff.</p> <p> <strong> Air New Zealand: Panorama</strong><br> <strong> Rating:</strong> 3/5</p> <p> A cover picture of actress-of-the-moment Cate Blanchett makes this magazine more of a page turner. But it still features the obligatory introduction from president and chief executive Gary Toomey, updating you on the airline's network development, reminding you that this is not something you just buy over the counter at a newsagents. The publication tries hard to be trendy with a LookCool section on the latest gadgets.</p>",

      "bodyText": "You get to the airport late, rush through check-in and passport control and then just as you're easing into your minuscule seat for a 12-hour trip, you remember something. You forgot to stop by W.H. Smith for a bonkbuster and a real magazine. Now you are trapped with nothing but a few peanuts and an in-flight magazine for amusement. Few reading experiences can be less pleasurable, unless you are flying Virgin Atlantic or British Airways, which have long taken their magazines seriously, offering plenty of stuff you really want to read. This month they have both revamped their offerings, making them even more readable and putting them even further ahead of the pack. Here we review the improved versions, plus a handful of the competition which, unfortunately, is lagging behind woefully. British Airways: Highlife Rating: 4/5 Put Jude Law on the cover and few women can fail to flick further. 'The real me is the person at home eating toast,' he says. A quick turn to page 50 delivers more steamy pictures and a pacey read to match. The magazine seems to have a younger, more stylish feel than before - a little bit of a Wallpapery influence shows up in the typeface and design. There are lots of small items to browse - tips on shopping (Jetset musts include Berluti shoes), cool hotels and celebs such as Vivienne Westwood. The main offputting thing is the over-abundance of advertisements and junk stapled inside, which makes flicking the thing difficult. Will Self's feature on Walking Britain in a Day, written before the foot and mouth epidemic, was a typical example of magazine deadlines clashing with more up to date events. BA: Business Life Rating: 4/5 Sex and money are always guaranteed to draw the readers in. BA has managed to combine both in a front cover shot of Madonna pitching an article inside on her multi-million pound business empire. Sharp designs and witty writing mix with indulgent reviews of fast cars, consumer gadgets and a half-page eulogy of the Cuban cigar. This redesigned magazine for the business traveller is something you'd definitely want to take off the plane. Virgin Atlantic: Hot Air Rating: 4/5 The front cover photograph looking up Angelina Jolie's nostrils gets you interested, but the words are confusingly run together: 'Audley Harrison Planet Of The Apes Daft Punk The Rebirth of Berlin Subbuteo Streakers'. God knows how a non-English speaker would cope, and the inside is terrifyingly trendy. It's big on architecture and design, with Berlin and Guggenheim making appearances, and it feels like a real magazine, rather than a freebie. It's beautifully laid out, advertisements blend in rather than clash, and it is printed on rich matt paper. This is one of the few airline mags you'd want to take home. There are lots of snippets about hotels, or things to see, which are worth cutting out. Only criticism is it's a bit top heavy on boys' toys - golf, football, Lego, cars, tigers, trainers and travel gear (but that's not surprising really as it's edited by former Arena editor Ekow Eshun). We'd have liked a bit more on handbags, but maybe we'll have to wait till the next issue for that. Icelandair - Iceland Review Rating: 1/5 The dark cover of a man with overgrown eyebrows peeping from the shadows is gloomy and depressing, and its headline, 'Solitary farming', doesn't set the pulse racing. The typeface and layout are clean and modern, but rather static throughout. The features are worthy and dull. How about 'Icelandic chess has a multifarious nature...' Even the apparently promising feature on erotic clubs in Reykjavik reads like a local authority newsletter. It tells us: 'Currently serving her second term as the democratically-elected major of Reykjavik, Ingibjorg Solrun Gisladottir, voices her concern over the number of erotic clubs operating in the capital area.' American Airlines: American Way Rating: 0/5 It's a big struggle to get past the front page. Printing all the words in capital letters is guaranteed to make you go cross-eyed. The inside is packed thick with cardboard advertising inserts and bits of paper selling phone cards and frequent flyer memberships. We can't find anything else of interest to read, and wonder, who on earth is this for? Cathay Pacific: Discovery Rating: 2/5 There's nothing Zeitgeist about this magazine. A cover story on the Tate Modern turns out to be a rather dull overview of the building's history and its art. The layout of the piece is dated and boring. Some impressive photography of Angkor Wat makes up for another rather lifeless article. Rather bizarrely, the picture captions are bilingual, but the rest of the articles are in English. Perhaps the Hong Kong Chinese only look at the pictures? Not something you'd want to take home with you. Qantas: The Australian Way Rating: 3/5 A dark picture of a Qantas aircraft is a poor choice of cover picture for an interesting in-flight fashion shoot feature. Few plugs for this Australian carrier's own products make this a more refreshing read, but the editorial fails to stand out from its rivals. Canadian novelist Margaret Atwood spices things up when she waxes lyrical about her home city, Toronto, but the rest is pretty standard stuff. Air New Zealand: Panorama Rating: 3/5 A cover picture of actress-of-the-moment Cate Blanchett makes this magazine more of a page turner. But it still features the obligatory introduction from president and chief executive Gary Toomey, updating you on the airline's network development, reminding you that this is not something you just buy over the counter at a newsagents. The publication tries hard to be trendy with a LookCool section on the latest gadgets.",

You soon learn to wake up every day in Madagascar expecting the extraordinary. </p> <p>If we thought that hailing a taxi to take us back to the hotel would signal the end of the excitement, we were very much mistaken. One of the hazards of the rainy season is that roads frequently turn into rivers. Our clapped-out yet relentlessly brave little Renault taxi battled upstream, but not surprisingly broke down. Our driver moaned and dropped his head on to the steering wheel. It didn't look good: it was 3am, pitch-black, pouring, there was nobody around, and it was a one-and-a-half-hour walk either back to Hell Ville or on to our hotel. What to do? </p> <p>The driver showed resourcefulness beyond the call of duty by wading around to the bonnet, ripping off his T-shirt and mopping the engine down. Amazingly, it worked. </p> <p>The British autumn, which is Madagascar's spring, is considered the best time to visit. The rainy season - at its worst from January to March - didn't prove too much of a disadvantage. The temperature was still soothingly warm, there was enough sunshine to keep you smiling, the atmosphere was relentlessly dramatic and, best of all, we had remarkable places virtually to ourselves. </p> <p>Not another human was in sight as we surveyed a grand canyon of spectacularly eroded rose and orange pinnacles, were cooled down by a lush waterfall, or attempted abject Tarzan impressions on creepers hanging from the legendary baobab trees, or befriended rare animals in the middle of the rainforest. It is not necessary to be a budding David Attenborough to be charmed by Madagascar's natural history, but once there it would be a sin not to dip your toe into a magical environment which is home to more than 200,000 species. </p> <p>We visited four forests. The first was in Perinet, a two-hour drive from the capital, Antananarivo.'Look at this! Ah! Look!' our guide, Luc, purred as he pointed out the chameleons (an intense shade of emerald), snakes (nothing to worry about - honestly), and Jurassic-sized snails , quick to remind us that everything in Madagascar is 'non-poisonous and very friendly'. </p> <p>As we traipsed on through the never-ending green, suddenly he froze, saying 'One moment please' before disappearing into the thickets to follow his hunch. He returned to guide us towards the lemurs. Beautiful, lissome, inquisitive, oozing character, these engaging creatures can only be found in the wild in Madagascar. They belong to a group of primates called prosimians, which means 'before monkeys'. Apparently they ruled the trees until the more highly developed monkeys took over, at which point they became extinct everywhere except Madagascar. </p> <p>When what is the world's fourth biggest island broke away from Africa millions of years ago, a few lemurs took refuge. And thank goodness they did, for they are a joy to behold today. It's easy to find them in the forests. Certain species are particularly sociable and will catch you in the gaze of their amber, unblinking eyes, come to munch a banana from your fingers, give you an outrageously soft hand to hold, then try to pinch your camera. An unmistakable resemblance to cheeky monkeys. </p> <p>Though rightly renowned for its biodiversity, there is far more to the Madagascar experience than wildlife. As far as the cities are concerned, while Antananarivo can be overwhelming, some of the smaller towns are great fun and unspoilt by tourism. You can meander through the vibrant street markets or the ranks of tuk-tuks (three-wheeled taxis) and people just smile and hum ' Bonjour!

      "bodyText": "With more than 40 million travel pages on the web, holidaymakers have never had so much travel information at their fingertips. And that is the trouble. Try to find something useful or original to help you plan a su mmer or weekend break a nd you can easily spend several hours trawling through amateur holiday diaries, 'mom and pop' travel agencies in Michigan and young Archie's homework project. The information superhighway increasingly resembles the M25 on the first bank holiday of the summer. Search engines have buckled under the volume, while cash-hungry portals are signing deals with 'recommended' suppliers. The overload is certain to worsen as travel confirms itself as the most - maybe the only - successful e-commerce sector. Despite the fall of high-profile uTravel, Travelchest and Dreamticket, our enthusiasm for cheap flights, hotels and car hire online remains undiminished. In the four weeks to Christmas, Britons spent \u00a3201 million on internet travel and holidays, compared with a national online grocery bill of \u00a337m. With surveys reporting that 80 per cent of online travel bookers are happy with their experience, we can all look forward to even lower fares and hotel rates. But if online travel is living up to its promise of price cuts, it is failing to give us choice. Online travel is dominated by a handful of airlines and giant online agencies, all offering a limited range of mainstream holidays. Travel is the stuff of dreams, and we need the web to deliver more than a tenner off a flight to Paris. So here - rated from one to five stars - are the 20 most useful travel sites you have never heard of... Fit For Travel *** Perfect site for the paranoid. This lets you know all the diseases you can catch at your chosen destination. Also a cheery update on economy-class syndrome. This site is highly interactive, and, amazingly, produced by the NHS. AirTreks.com *** The ultimate fantasy site. Just click on a colourful world map and design your dream itinerary. My theoretical holiday route of London-New York-New Orleans-Rio de Janeiro-Sydney-Bangkok-Amsterdam-London came up at a mere \u00a32,000. Tempting. Travelgate ** No-nonsense directory of 1,500 websites 'to do with travel and tourism to, from and within Great Britain' offers impartial advice. Helicopter flights to house swapping. Travel.World ** Claims to be 'the largest index of European travel agents and tour operators on the internet'. Goldmine of continental special interest holiday firms and a refreshing change from US-dominated counterparts. Holidays in the UK **** Direct links to local operators of walking, hiking, cycling, mountain biking, narrowboating, birdwatching and other special interest and activity tours in the UK. Nothing fancy - just a wide range of activities - and an essential foot and mouth update. InfoHub *** No online booking but plenty of good ideas for trips in every conceivable special interest category. 100hot Web Rankings ** Use this listing of the 100 most visited travel websites in the past week as a convenient portal to all the major hotel, airline and online travel agency sites. Heavily US-biased but that's the web. Asia Travel *** Did you know you can book a five-star hotel room in Bangkok for less than \u00a330 a night? Best of the Asian travel sites. Flights.com *** This is a big corporate site based in Germany. Especially good for unusual routes (a friend saved \u00a3350 on a one-way economy Islamabad-Sydney flight). Advantage Travel Centres **** This site links you directly to your nearest independent travel agent with whom you can book online or offline. The holiday range is mainstream but you have the security of dealing with a fully bonded and licensed member of the Association of British Travel Agents. Biking UK *** Great portal to mountain biking websites. Biking UK also features overseas tour providers. Very basic. Very easy to use. Just like riding a bike. Parishotels.com **** What every city needs. Nice maps, easy navigation, good pictures and concise descriptions of hotels in every price range. You can find and request your hotel in less than 10 minutes. The only snag is having to wait up to 24 hours for an email confirmation from le patron. Tourism Offices Worldwide Directory *** What a great idea.

If it's happening on the planet, then whatsonwhen can probably give you the dates and some deep background. Its 21 themes include everything from the bizarre, such as this week's Skin Disease Show in Bordeaux, to the more prosaic sport, film, clubs and parties.

Where to find a flight The UK's - and Europe's - favourite online travel provider is low-cost airline easyJet. Fares are \u00a32.50 cheaper for web bookings, and the airline receives 86 per cent of its business via the internet. Rock-bottom fares have helped Ryanair become Europe's fifth biggest internet travel provider. British Airways has the UK's third most popular airline website, followed by Virgin Express. Our preferred online travel agent is ebookers. It has negotiated special fares with 120 airlines, while most of its rivals simply sell the best available fares. Other popular online travel agents are: Expedia, the local branch of Microsoft's global Expedia empire, with a strong focus on cheap flights. Thomas Cook, selling package tours of its own brands, such as JMC, Club 18-30 and Neilsons, as well as flights and hotels.

The former MI5 officer is often accused of being a self-publicist, but on this occasion the media circus he always attracts will be entirely justified. With a cast of witnesses that could include Home Secretary Jack Straw, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, MI5 director Stephen Lander and his predecessor Stella Rimington, a host of acting MI5 and MI6 officers, agent runners, the event will be irresistable to journalists. Indeed, some members of the 4th Estate who have had contact with Shayler in the last four years may find themselves in the witness box themselves.</p> <p>The Shayler trial will be a unique moment in English legal history, a direct confrontation between the Official Secrets Act and the Human Rights Act. These two pieces of legislation, drafted at opposite ends of the twentieth century, are strikingly different in tone and intention and reflect the contrasting historical realities of the eras in which they were originally drafted. The Official Secrets Act of 1911, which remains the model for the existing legislation, was drafted as a post-colonial response to the growing power of Germany and the fear that the country was being flooded by foreign agents. Its central tenets of lifetime loyalty to the British state and the protection of official secrets regardless of their nature, remained largely unquestioned during two world wars and much of the cold war that followed. The Human Rights Act, in contrast, grew out of a post-war determination to never let the conditions that led to war in Europe (and more particularly the holocaust) from ever developing again. It is difficult to imagine two more contrasting pieces of legislation - many hours of court time have already been taken up with arguments about whether the two acts are compatible in English law. The trial itself will challenge the very existence of the Official Secrets Act, while testing for the first time whether the new human rights legislation has real teeth,</p> <p>Since David Shayler first went public with his claims of intelligence service incompetence and malpractice in 1997, the Official Secrets Act has been under fire from all sides. At present there is no public interest defence under the act - Shayler can not, therefore, argue that he went to the newspapers because he believed readers had a right to know that the intelligence services were wasting their money on time-consuming and largely pointless bureaucracy. Neither is there an internal mechanism for dealing with whistleblowers who wish to report more serious wrongdoing carried out in our name - such as the claim that an MI6 plot to kill Libya's Colonel Gaddafi had led to the death of innocent bystanders. Shayler's lawyers will argue that such gaps in the present legislation are in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p> <p>In opposition the Labour Party opposed the use of the Official Secrets Act for two reasons it did not contain a single measure to protect whistleblowers and it had no public interest defence. Even the former Conservative and intelligence expert Rupert Allason has said the British government has an appalling record of attempting to classify as 'top secret' mere political embarrassment.</p> <p>Unlike Allason, a consistent critic of Shayler's actions, members of the present cabinet voted against the new legislation. And yet, in power, they have allowed the intelligence services and the police to pursue whistleblowers and journalists under its terms in an unprecedented series of high profile cases: this is despite an avowed commitment to open government and freedom of information. Journalists Ed Moloney, Tony Geraghty and Liam Clarke have all been pursued through the courts after refusing to compromise the sources for their information about alleged wrongdoing by the security services in Northern Ireland. The Observer and Guardian newspapers spent five months of last year fighting off attempts by Special Branch to obtain details of alleged communications with David Shayler including emails and notebooks. A student member of Shayler's support campaign, Julie-Ann Davis, was dragged from classes.</p> <p>In each case so far, the intelligence services have failed in every attempt to enforce the Official Secrets Act. Perhaps most embarassing was the attack on Lt Col Nigel Wylde, an explosives and IT expert who was accused of passing classified information to Tony Geraghty for his history of the troubles, The Irish War. The case was eventually dropped after it was revealed that everything in the book was already in the public domain. The one case that they appeared to have won has just been overturned on appeal. James Steen, the editor of Punch was originally fined for publishing an article repeating claims that the IRA bombing of Bishopsgate in the City of London could have been averted.</p> <p>In its long history, the Official Secrets Act has hardly ever been used, but it has been wielded on more occasions since Tony Blair came to power than ever before. Whitehall sources have told journalists that many in government have lost the stomach for the fight, but that some senior civil servants and hardliners within the intelligence services remain resistant to change. Despite repeated failures in the cases mentioned above, they seem determined to pursue David Shayler to the bitter end.

The pages will make explosive reading at Buckingham Palace where officials will this morning meet to consider an official response to the newspaper's allegations. The news is also bleak for the Countess of Wessex and Murray Harkin, her partner in PR company R-JH. The paper devotes two pages to the secretly-recorded boasts of Harkin, 37, who appeared to suggest he had used hard drugs. Harkin is alleged to have told Mazher Mahmood, the News of the World reporter who posed as a sheikh's assistant, that he had taken cocaine and ecstasy. Harkin is reported to have told Mahmood he could arrange for the countess and her husband Prince Edward to endorse various business deals which the fake sheikh pretended he was trying to establish. The Queen is fiercely opposed to members of the royal family cashing in on their position. Palace officials will also find it difficult to brush aside disparaging comments made by the countess about figures such as Prime Minister Tony Blair, Chancellor Gordon Brown and Camilla Parker-Bowlers and Prince Charles. Here we reprint an edited version of the transcripts published by The News of The World. What the Sophie tapes say The countess of Wessex has ridden roughshod over the convention that members of the royal family should never comment on politics. Her indiscretion on the so-called 'Sophie Tapes' raises disturbing questions, given her delicate constitutional position and access to confidential information, about her role as a PR company director. Her business partner at R-JH, Murray Harkin, is also revealed as less than discreet in his boasts about royal influence, the Earl of Wessex's sexuality and drug-taking. In the News of the World 's transcripts, the countess appears to betray strong Tory sympathies, describing it as a 'shame' if William Hague loses the election. She dismisses Gordon Brown's Budget as 'pap', criticises Labour's attempts to ban fox hunting, and accuses former Prime Minister John Major of leaking damaging royal information to distract from his political problems. The thoughts of the countess and Harkin were secretly recorded at a lunch in London's Dorchester Hotel on 14 March. Also present was R-JH account director Brett Perkins, and two undercover 'fake sheikhs', the News of the World 's Mahzer Mahmood and photojournalist Conrad Brown. Asked about hunting, the countess accuses Blair of not understanding countryside issues. Sophie: 'He's ignorant of the countryside. His wife is even worse, she hates the countryside. She hates it! And because the popular vote is within the city, he's going to go with that all the time. I mean because of the foot and mouth situation they've been forced to take notice of the countryside.' Mahmood: 'She [Cherie] seems low key.' Sophie: 'She's an intelligent woman and I think she wanted to keep her hand in. Or maybe she didn't think her husband's government was going to last long so she'd have to go back to work anyway.' The reporter then asks who is going to lose the forthcoming general election. Harkin: 'The Tories.' Sophie: 'I think the majority is too great. Labour will lose a lot of seats.' Harkin: 'Portillo seems nice.

Sophie: 'I know it wasn't off the cuff at all because I know who wrote it ... we call him President Blair over here anyway because he thinks he is.' When Mahmood suggests that Blair is Clinton 'without Monica', Sophie jokes: 'Well we don't know that!'

      "body": "<p>There have been times in his career when this sense of well-being has seemed like a distant prospect, however: as recently as a year ago, at Indian Wells, Safin was considering giving up the game for good. The man who changed his mind then was Andrei Chesnokov, the former Russian Davis Cup player, who has known him since he himself was a boy training at the Spartak club and Safin's mother used to bring her baby to courtside in a pram.</p> <p>Speaking from Paris, where he is playing, Chesnokov explains that by the time Safin was 13 he could see that he was going to be a very great player - 'he had very good hands, a perfect feeling for the ball, he always saw it early and hit it with great power' Subsequently he saw the prodigy come of age, beating Agassi at Roland Garros in 1998 as a qualifier. Two years later, though, out of the blue, Chesnokov got a call from 'one of Marat's agents', as he says, who told him that Safin no longer wanted to play at all; after a run of dramatically poor results he was thinking of quitting the game. The agent wondered if a Russian might be able to help, someone he could communicate properly with.</p> <p>The first thing that Chesnokov tried to establish was that Safin had informed his mentor Mensua that he was seeking a new coach. He hadn't, so it was a few weeks before the pair joined up, at Barcelona. Safin had, at that stage, won four matches in five months. On the practice court, Chesnokov says, he just watched him without speaking for an hour. 'Then I said to him, \"The way you practise is no way to practise.\" His mind was not on the court, he was talking to people as they walked by, always looking around for what was going on. And he was trying to hit every ball as hard as he could.' </p> <p>Chesnokov says that he did not coach Safin, so much as help him get his head together; but the results were immediate. He won in Barcelona and then again the following week in Mallorca. In a few months his ranking went from 123 in the world to No 9. Looking back on that change of fortunes now, Safin recalls how, previously, 'If I was playing good, I was playing unbelievable, but when I was playing bad, I couldn't beat my mother. [With Andrei] I started to practise with my head, not my strokes and everything came together.'</p> <p>Oddly, the relationship did not last. Characteristically, it seems, having learnt what he thought he could from his friend the single-minded Safin simply moved on. After the French Open Chesnokov heard that Safin had gone to practise on grass with Tony Pickard, Stefan Edberg's former coach. There was no phone call, no explanation. ('Why would he do that, when we had just won everything together?' Chesnokov still wonders). When he called the office of Safin's agent, at the time, he says someone told him: 'Don't you fuck with us.' The pair, not surprisingly have hardly spoken since though Safin, when he is listing his closest friends, still numbers Chesnokov among them. 'I can talk to Andrei, for example, about anything,' he says, apparently oblivious to the bad feeling he has caused.</p> <p>In some ways, Safin has many reasons to be thankful to players like Chesnokov , and not just for helping him get his game back on course. In recent years with the on-court success of the likes of Kafelnikov and the off-court success of Anna Kournikova, tennis has become more popular than ever in Russia, and there is a whole group of young players ready to follow in Safin's size elevens. Yet a generation ago tennis was hardly even recognised as a sport, and dismissed as bourgeois by the Olympic-obsessed Soviet authorities. When Chesnokov first played the game at school in the Seventies he went home and told his family that he was going to be a tennis player, and they had never heard of the game. Even in the Eighties when people asked him about what he did, and he explained, everyone would assume he was a table tennis star.</p> <p>It would take many days, he tells me a little wearily, to describe the particular differences between his era and Safin's but he names a few: for a start it was almost impossible to travel; for another thing, Russian players could not compete in tournaments that included South Africans or Israelis; and wherever he went Chesnokov had the KGB with him, too, making sure he did not fraternise with the wrong people. Things began to change with glasnost, and the game really took a hold under Yeltsin, who was himself a keen player. Now, tennis is Russia's fastest growing sport.</p> <p>When he looks at the earning potential of the likes of Safin now, Chesnokov says, he wishes them good luck and does not dwell on the fact that at their age he was not allowed to claim any prize money. He is philosophical, too, about the different pressures players like Safin are now under. Does he think, I wonder, given all of Safin's advantages, that he can achieve all that he promises to achieve, or does he believe that his head might still get in his way?</p> <p>'I think,' he says, 'Marat will become a great, great player. As long, that is, as he chooses the right people to have around him.'</p> <p>The latest Mr Right, for Safin at Indian Wells is, of course, Mats Wilander, and when he talks of his coach it is with the excitement of a new flirtation, his latest squeeze. The pair were set up as a blind date by a mutual friend; in the few days they have been together here they are enjoying first impressions. 'It's not that often that a guy like this comes along,' says Safin, deadpan, 'so I'm trying to be nice to him: I make sure I pay all his bills. But I think we have very different characters, you know, I need what he has, and actually, he needs what I have.'</p> <p>Wilander, now 36, is still playing the seniors tour and, without too much sweat, still beating most people ('except McEnroe, of course'). He has four children and a single-figure golf handicap. The incentives to go back on the road for 20 weeks a year - 'the minimum you need to do, I guess' - are, you suppose, not that great. The thing that persuaded him was, he says, seeing Safin play last year. He had been playing golf in Sun Valley about four weeks before Flushing Meadow, 'and everyone was asking me who would win the Open, and I'd been watching Marat, and I just asked them if they had seen him. No one had of course. So I said, \"You know unless this guy gets injured, there is no way Sampras is going to win a set off him.\" And they are all like, \"Yeah sure Mats.\" But it was simple to see really...'</p> <p>When his prediction came true Wilander was more excited than ever about Safin's game. 'In the finals he was maybe playing 50 per cent of his ability,' he says, warming to the vicarious pleasures of the cornerman. 'He didn't get carried away like, say, Phillipoussis did when he got into the final of a slam, or Henri Leconte. Safin proved he was on a different level to that. He proved that mentally he is all there. He has it. It's just that sometimes he takes his eye off it. But on that occasion he just said: \"Here I am, I'm better than you, and here it all comes.\" And he was playing easy percentage tennis. Against Sampras. No one has ever done that. . .'</p> <p>In the short time they have been together, Wilander seems to have formed an easy bond with his charge - he speaks of him as a favourite son and fellow traveller: another cool European in a land of college jocks. Attempting to explain why Safin will win many more grand slams, he explains that he sees the time the Russian spent in Spain as crucial to his development (tennis, it seems, lends itself to easy national stereotypes): 'He's much softer, if you know what I mean, than the generic Eastern European guys,' Wilander argues. 'I mean I love them all. But, say, with some of the Czech guys it looks like they have a hard time really giving, getting in there and fighting really hard.</p> <p>'Not even Ivan Lendl was able to do that until his latter years. He was in many ways a typical Eastern Bloc athlete: he'd be there for the money mostly. Yevgeny has a bit of that in him too [Kafelnikov, who is worth upwards of \u00a315 million, recently complained that tennis players were not properly rewarded], you can see him fight sometimes but sometimes it's just kind of shallow...' Safin, by contrast, is there purely for the game, Wilander believes.</p> <p>I wonder if there are elements of his own personality at 21 that he now recognises in the Russian? He leans forward, takes his sunglasses off, becomes animated. 'He's very curious,' he says. 'In people, in tennis, in what everyone is doing. You know he always asks - \"Did you go out last night? Where's a good place to go?\" - and you need to have that. Your brain cannot stop expanding just because you are a tennis professional. You know, I like the glint in his eye. . . If you have that you are bound to do better over the course of a career and are bound also to have more peaks and valleys. </p> <p>'You find that the players who just go along straight,who never have a bad day, are never ever going to win the big tournaments, like Medvedev, or Corretja, say. They play just the same at the slams, and that's never going to be good enough. Marat has this kind of Tiger Woods mentality, he knows that the moment itself will fire him....'</p> <p>At Indian Wells, unfortunately, the moment, such as it is, in a half-empty, sepulchrally quiet stadium is nowhere near enough to fire Safin, still hampered in his flesh-coloured corset. Serving at about 40 miles per hour below his normal pace he succumbs to the hustling Swede Tomas Johansen, pausing only to hurl his racket at the foot of the umpire's chair in disgust.</p> <p>Afterwards though, he is happy enough. Pleased he came, glad he tried (and, you suspect, though he does not say as much, content to have secured the extra money that will be due to him at the end of the year having played, injured, in this 'mandatory' tournament). He is still having fun, too, with his new coach ('I lose,' he says, 'and even then he was happy with me.') He has, he is sure, plenty to look forward to, knows this is just a stutter, his ambition is set firmly on next month's French Open, his favourite tournament. 'I will do everything to win Roland Garros. Of course I'd like to win all the grand slams, make people happy, win some money, stay No 1 for five years, and enjoy my life. But my big aim this year is Roland Garros.' </p> <p>The big thing about Safin's game, Wilander says later, is that he has the ability to win on any surface. Having just failed to win the grand slam himself - he won everything except Wimbledon in 1988 - I wonder if one of the incentives for him as a coach is to achieve what he missed out on as a player? </p> <p>'Perhaps,' he says, but for the moment he is not looking too far ahead. 'We decided that we would try to make it through this evening,' he says, laughing. 'I thought that maybe now he lost he would just kick me out straightaway. But I'm going to hang in there, wait to see what happens.' As they drive off together into a sunset over the high sierra, you imagine that, with Safin, he will not have to wait too long. </p> <p> <strong>Joining the bourgeoisie</strong> </p> <p>Six of Safin's countrymen leading the Russian takeover of tennis</p> <p><strong>Anna Kournikova </strong> </p> <p><strong>Birthplace</strong> Moscow</p> <p><strong>Age</strong> 19</p> <p><strong>World ranking</strong> 9</p> <p><strong>WTA singles titles</strong> 0</p> <p><strong>Prize money</strong> $2,692,929</p> <p>Formidable groundstokes, but still has something to prove.

      "bodyText": "There have been times in his career when this sense of well-being has seemed like a distant prospect, however: as recently as a year ago, at Indian Wells, Safin was considering giving up the game for good. The man who changed his mind then was Andrei Chesnokov, the former Russian Davis Cup player, who has known him since he himself was a boy training at the Spartak club and Safin's mother used to bring her baby to courtside in a pram. Speaking from Paris, where he is playing, Chesnokov explains that by the time Safin was 13 he could see that he was going to be a very great player - 'he had very good hands, a perfect feeling for the ball, he always saw it early and hit it with great power' Subsequently he saw the prodigy come of age, beating Agassi at Roland Garros in 1998 as a qualifier. Two years later, though, out of the blue, Chesnokov got a call from 'one of Marat's agents', as he says, who told him that Safin no longer wanted to play at all; after a run of dramatically poor results he was thinking of quitting the game. The agent wondered if a Russian might be able to help, someone he could communicate properly with. The first thing that Chesnokov tried to establish was that Safin had informed his mentor Mensua that he was seeking a new coach. He hadn't, so it was a few weeks before the pair joined up, at Barcelona. Safin had, at that stage, won four matches in five months. On the practice court, Chesnokov says, he just watched him without speaking for an hour. 'Then I said to him, \"The way you practise is no way to practise.\" His mind was not on the court, he was talking to people as they walked by, always looking around for what was going on. And he was trying to hit every ball as hard as he could.' Chesnokov says that he did not coach Safin, so much as help him get his head together; but the results were immediate. He won in Barcelona and then again the following week in Mallorca. In a few months his ranking went from 123 in the world to No 9. Looking back on that change of fortunes now, Safin recalls how, previously, 'If I was playing good, I was playing unbelievable, but when I was playing bad, I couldn't beat my mother. [With Andrei] I started to practise with my head, not my strokes and everything came together.' Oddly, the relationship did not last. Characteristically, it seems, having learnt what he thought he could from his friend the single-minded Safin simply moved on. After the French Open Chesnokov heard that Safin had gone to practise on grass with Tony Pickard, Stefan Edberg's former coach. There was no phone call, no explanation. ('Why would he do that, when we had just won everything together?' Chesnokov still wonders). When he called the office of Safin's agent, at the time, he says someone told him: 'Don't you fuck with us.' The pair, not surprisingly have hardly spoken since though Safin, when he is listing his closest friends, still numbers Chesnokov among them. 'I can talk to Andrei, for example, about anything,' he says, apparently oblivious to the bad feeling he has caused. In some ways, Safin has many reasons to be thankful to players like Chesnokov , and not just for helping him get his game back on course. In recent years with the on-court success of the likes of Kafelnikov and the off-court success of Anna Kournikova, tennis has become more popular than ever in Russia, and there is a whole group of young players ready to follow in Safin's size elevens. Yet a generation ago tennis was hardly even recognised as a sport, and dismissed as bourgeois by the Olympic-obsessed Soviet authorities. When Chesnokov first played the game at school in the Seventies he went home and told his family that he was going to be a tennis player, and they had never heard of the game. Even in the Eighties when people asked him about what he did, and he explained, everyone would assume he was a table tennis star. It would take many days, he tells me a little wearily, to describe the particular differences between his era and Safin's but he names a few: for a start it was almost impossible to travel; for another thing, Russian players could not compete in tournaments that included South Africans or Israelis; and wherever he went Chesnokov had the KGB with him, too, making sure he did not fraternise with the wrong people. Things began to change with glasnost, and the game really took a hold under Yeltsin, who was himself a keen player. Now, tennis is Russia's fastest growing sport. When he looks at the earning potential of the likes of Safin now, Chesnokov says, he wishes them good luck and does not dwell on the fact that at their age he was not allowed to claim any prize money. He is philosophical, too, about the different pressures players like Safin are now under. Does he think, I wonder, given all of Safin's advantages, that he can achieve all that he promises to achieve, or does he believe that his head might still get in his way? 'I think,' he says, 'Marat will become a great, great player. As long, that is, as he chooses the right people to have around him.' The latest Mr Right, for Safin at Indian Wells is, of course, Mats Wilander, and when he talks of his coach it is with the excitement of a new flirtation, his latest squeeze. The pair were set up as a blind date by a mutual friend; in the few days they have been together here they are enjoying first impressions. 'It's not that often that a guy like this comes along,' says Safin, deadpan, 'so I'm trying to be nice to him: I make sure I pay all his bills. But I think we have very different characters, you know, I need what he has, and actually, he needs what I have.' Wilander, now 36, is still playing the seniors tour and, without too much sweat, still beating most people ('except McEnroe, of course'). He has four children and a single-figure golf handicap. The incentives to go back on the road for 20 weeks a year - 'the minimum you need to do, I guess' - are, you suppose, not that great. The thing that persuaded him was, he says, seeing Safin play last year. He had been playing golf in Sun Valley about four weeks before Flushing Meadow, 'and everyone was asking me who would win the Open, and I'd been watching Marat, and I just asked them if they had seen him. No one had of course. So I said, \"You know unless this guy gets injured, there is no way Sampras is going to win a set off him.\" And they are all like, \"Yeah sure Mats.\" But it was simple to see really...' When his prediction came true Wilander was more excited than ever about Safin's game. 'In the finals he was maybe playing 50 per cent of his ability,' he says, warming to the vicarious pleasures of the cornerman. 'He didn't get carried away like, say, Phillipoussis did when he got into the final of a slam, or Henri Leconte. Safin proved he was on a different level to that. He proved that mentally he is all there. He has it. It's just that sometimes he takes his eye off it. But on that occasion he just said: \"Here I am, I'm better than you, and here it all comes.\" And he was playing easy percentage tennis. Against Sampras. No one has ever done that. . .' In the short time they have been together, Wilander seems to have formed an easy bond with his charge - he speaks of him as a favourite son and fellow traveller: another cool European in a land of college jocks. Attempting to explain why Safin will win many more grand slams, he explains that he sees the time the Russian spent in Spain as crucial to his development (tennis, it seems, lends itself to easy national stereotypes): 'He's much softer, if you know what I mean, than the generic Eastern European guys,' Wilander argues. 'I mean I love them all. But, say, with some of the Czech guys it looks like they have a hard time really giving, getting in there and fighting really hard.

      "trailText": "<p>Amy Lawrence in praise of Arsenal's dynamic midfielder, coveted by the elite</p>",
      "byline": "Amy Lawrence",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Half time, one-nil down, cursing the implications of an away goal, not terribly convinced the game could be salvaged: here was Highbury the library at its most muted. Whether the poignant tribute to lost legend David Rocastle on the ground's big screen stirred something in Arsenal's soul is hard to say, but one player set about the second half fuelled by the kind of voracious desire Rocky epitomised, and Arsenal suddenly had a Champions League lifeline. Stride forward Patrick Vieira. Thierry Henry's equaliser evolved from Vieira's fearless surge deep into Valencia territory. He raised the tempo singlehandedly as Arsenal edged home 2-1. </p> <p>Ars\u00e8ne Wenger believes there is no better player in the world in his position. Anyone who disagrees is simply invited to prove it. 'If you find a better one bring him to me,' is the challenge. 'He was outstanding against Valencia, especially the second half. He had tremendous physical impact linked with a top-class technical performance and to get that right together is very difficult as a player. Goalscoring is his only weakness, but I believe if your attitude is right you can improve your whole career, until 30, 31 if you play in midfield, and Patrick is only 25.' Little wonder, then, Wenger insists he is not for sale at any price. </p> <p>Juventus, openly belligerent in their quest to sign Vieira, had a scout at Highbury to watch the Frenchman they hope to link with Zinedine Zidane in their midfield. 'I think Juventus were there to buy some players from Valencia,' quipped Wenger. Nice try. The constant flow of rumours coming from Italy, which no number of rejections from Highbury seem capable of damming, is something Arsenal have to live with. 'It's the price when you have good players,' acknowledged their manager reluctantly. </p> <p>European nights, especially those fired with the intensity of a roaring comeback, play a crucial part in keeping the vultures at bay. As Wenger explains: 'What is important when you are a player of his stature is to play at the top level. When you're in the quarter finals of the Champions League, semi-finals of the FA Cup, and at the top of the Championship, that is what the clubs have to give to the best players. I think the English league is the best with the Spanish league and when you are a footballer you want to play amongst the best and to win things at the top level, it's quite simple.' </p> <p>The same applies to the strike force, particularly the second most-coveted Arsenal player, Henry. His scoring touch, still intact despite his clear fatigue, is vital to Arsenal. He has come up with critical goals in Europe and there is a strong feeling Arsenal need an away one of their own in Spain. Wenger promised his team would be on the offensive. Even reinforced by their all-English defence - with Martin Keown back to partner Tony Adams - going there only to protect their lead would be fatal. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Arsenal's resolve to keep Vieira is helped by the fact his turbulent relationship with English referees appears to have eased and Wenger adds: 'The attitude of referees has changed - they allow less people just to kick him.' And Wenger was grateful to Valencia for trying to play themselves instead of concentrating on smothering Vieira, as many opponents do. Hector Cuper, incidentally, is another admirer. </p> <p>Notably in the Champions League, Vieira's presence has been more telling in home games than away, where Arsenal tend to lack confidence. It's a tall order to expect Vieira, with all his hard-edged elegance, to command a midfield without the kind of top-quality help he received from Emmanuel Petit. To maintain their lead in the Mestella, Arsenal need the resolve Vieira and Adams supply on a regular basis to be prevalent all over the pitch.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Half time, one-nil down, cursing the implications of an away goal, not terribly convinced the game could be salvaged: here was Highbury the library at its most muted. Whether the poignant tribute to lost legend David Rocastle on the ground's big screen stirred something in Arsenal's soul is hard to say, but one player set about the second half fuelled by the kind of voracious desire Rocky epitomised, and Arsenal suddenly had a Champions League lifeline. Stride forward Patrick Vieira. Thierry Henry's equaliser evolved from Vieira's fearless surge deep into Valencia territory. He raised the tempo singlehandedly as Arsenal edged home 2-1. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger believes there is no better player in the world in his position. Anyone who disagrees is simply invited to prove it. 'If you find a better one bring him to me,' is the challenge. 'He was outstanding against Valencia, especially the second half. He had tremendous physical impact linked with a top-class technical performance and to get that right together is very difficult as a player. Goalscoring is his only weakness, but I believe if your attitude is right you can improve your whole career, until 30, 31 if you play in midfield, and Patrick is only 25.' Little wonder, then, Wenger insists he is not for sale at any price. Juventus, openly belligerent in their quest to sign Vieira, had a scout at Highbury to watch the Frenchman they hope to link with Zinedine Zidane in their midfield. 'I think Juventus were there to buy some players from Valencia,' quipped Wenger. Nice try. The constant flow of rumours coming from Italy, which no number of rejections from Highbury seem capable of damming, is something Arsenal have to live with. 'It's the price when you have good players,' acknowledged their manager reluctantly. European nights, especially those fired with the intensity of a roaring comeback, play a crucial part in keeping the vultures at bay. As Wenger explains: 'What is important when you are a player of his stature is to play at the top level. When you're in the quarter finals of the Champions League, semi-finals of the FA Cup, and at the top of the Championship, that is what the clubs have to give to the best players. I think the English league is the best with the Spanish league and when you are a footballer you want to play amongst the best and to win things at the top level, it's quite simple.' The same applies to the strike force, particularly the second most-coveted Arsenal player, Henry. His scoring touch, still intact despite his clear fatigue, is vital to Arsenal. He has come up with critical goals in Europe and there is a strong feeling Arsenal need an away one of their own in Spain. Wenger promised his team would be on the offensive. Even reinforced by their all-English defence - with Martin Keown back to partner Tony Adams - going there only to protect their lead would be fatal. Meanwhile, Arsenal's resolve to keep Vieira is helped by the fact his turbulent relationship with English referees appears to have eased and Wenger adds: 'The attitude of referees has changed - they allow less people just to kick him.' And Wenger was grateful to Valencia for trying to play themselves instead of concentrating on smothering Vieira, as many opponents do. Hector Cuper, incidentally, is another admirer. Notably in the Champions League, Vieira's presence has been more telling in home games than away, where Arsenal tend to lack confidence. It's a tall order to expect Vieira, with all his hard-edged elegance, to command a midfield without the kind of top-quality help he received from Emmanuel Petit. To maintain their lead in the Mestella, Arsenal need the resolve Vieira and Adams supply on a regular basis to be prevalent all over the pitch.",

      "body": "<p>Palm Springs is where corporate Californians come to die, the happy hunting ground of the golden state. Time here is measured out in long, air-conditioned days behind the high walls and digitally operated drawbridges of country clubs; by night the only signs of life are the thousands of automatic sprinklers which irrigate the desert's 100 impossibly verdant golf courses. Beyond this manicured green belt, snow-topped mountains rise up too high and fast from the dusty plain. These peaks form the stage-set backdrop for the city's one-week-a-year shrine to eternal youth: the Indian Wells tennis tournament.</p> <p>The new purpose-built stadium for this ritual event is almost cruelly vertiginous too, and each time play gets under way on court some of the more elderly locals are inevitably still feeling their way toward their seats, shuffling gingerly down steepling aisles, trying to decipher their ticket stubs through the wrong glasses, deaf to the patient promptings of an umpire asking them to hurry. There is a curious quiet everywhere. The only noise in the hot desert air, apart from the low thwack of balls, comes from the tennis village outside where a Simon and Garfunkel soundalike duo, Sounds of Silence, run through their acoustic repertoire and, every afternoon, Nick Bolletieri, tennis guru to the stars, explains on stage how terribly strange it feels to be seventy.</p> <p>In among the taco bars and power juice tents Silicon Valley snake-oil salesmen offer wrinkle creams and anti-ageing elixirs to ever hopeful disciples. It seems they need hardly bother: out on the practice courts nearby there seems enough energetic life force for it to be bottled, or received by osmosis. It is perhaps for this reason that a large woman, carrying two giant Slush Puppies, a small sack of pretzels and an oversized tennis ball, is breaking into an unaccustomed trot down the main concourse in the midday sun. She seems to have identified an urgent need to be in close proximity to some of this carefree physical power.</p> <p>As she jogs, sunglasses bouncing on the bridge of her nose, sweat breaking on her shoulders, her vast shorts straining to contain the geographical expanse of her behind, she calls to her friend, who is a few yards off her pace, to keep up. Then, nearing the court, where a crowd of like-minded over-nourished souls is already gathering, she half-turns to see her companion dropping back into the throng, and stage whispers one last exhortation: 'It's a big Russian guy,' she says, holding her place with one vast arm through the swelling crowd, 'and he's wearing some kind of pantyhose.'</p> <p>The big Russian guy in question, Marat Safin, 21 years old, the reigning US Open champion, and tennis's undisputed Next Big Thing, is indeed on court wearing a flesh-coloured reinforced girdle and baggy check shorts. He stands around six foot six in his technologically sculpted trainers, has a crew cut, the torso of a heavyweight boxer, and what look like dog tags around his neck. The girdle, which could be a surgical bandage, gives him the appearance of a war hero, and he is addressing the ball with something like the pent-up ferocity of a battle-fatigued conscript, smiling occasionally as if at his own easy aggression, and every so often feeling his rib cage where a troublesome muscle injury has kept him out of the previous three tournaments and threatens his participation in this one. </p> <p>At courtside, next to me, two teenage girls, giggling, smitten, are also concerned about Safin's back; in particular about the passionate provenance of a line of five parallel scratch marks just under his shoulder blade.</p> <p>In one corner of the court, by way of contrast to the intimidating presence of the Russian, is Mats Wilander, the winner of six grand slams, who today has embarked on a new life as Marat Safin's coach, the latest in a longish line. Wilander, a wiry figure, bandy legged, is watching his charge from behind Lennon-framed shades with a half-smile on his face, occasionally throwing Safin a ball and asking him how his injured ribs are holding up. 'There is pain,' Safin mutters darkly, 'but the doctor said there would be pain. Pain is normal.'</p> <p>Wilander is the only person in the stadium complex, and probably in the whole of Palm Springs, who is wearing clothes that do not appear to have been removed from their branded packaging that morning: he has on a washed-out khaki sweat top and well-travelled green shorts; his rackets are in beaten-up holdall; he hasn't shaved. His coaching, in this debut session, is limited to wry glances and the odd cryptic comment: 'Sometimes the balls look big here and sometimes they look small,' he says at one point. Safin nods agreement. 'They look pretty big today,' he says.</p> <p>When the pair eventually wander back the couple of hundred yards to the locker room, they lose each other on the way. Wilander, in his veteran kit, is allowed to pass through the crowds unmolested and unrecognised while a gaggle of fame-seekers swarms around the legs of the giant Safin, some touching his flesh or his corset as if to confirm he is real. The woman with the outsize ball holds it up for him to sign, and then studies the signature. </p> <p>'What's your name?' she yells at him.</p> <p>'Safin,' comes the smiling reply, 'Marat Safin.'</p> <p>And she goes off to repeat it, incorrectly, to her friend.</p> <p>It is a fair bet that it won't be long before most of us know Marat Safin's revolutionary name rather well. The day before he arrived here, I watched Pete Sampras, whose game Safin dismantled at Flushing Meadow, speak of the young Russian with something approaching awe. As he talked about Safin as 'the future', Sampras's weary body language clearly remembered the September afternoon in New York last year when his young opponent made him look like a balding 29-year-old who had just got married and had $100 million in the bank: a man who, having overwhelmed the court for a decade, suddenly found himself diminishing in stature point by point. </p> <p>The impression - despite Sampras's protestations to the contrary, and an avenging defeat towards the end of last season - has undoubtedly stuck. Tennis has long looked for a natural heir to the Agassi-Becker-Sampras generation: in Safin, to Sampras's eyes at least, it would seem the pretender has arrived.</p> <p>Off court, showered, and sprawled on a sofa in the player's lounge, Safin seems even bigger than he did whacking backhands in the afternoon sun. Though he is surrounded here by men of similar gargantuan build - Goran Ivanesevic, his hero and role model, is playing table tennis nearby (and losing, stylishly), Mark Phillipoussis is checking the draw on a TV screen - Safin generates an extra presence born of extreme physical confidence. He seems in no doubt he is an alpha male in this exalted company, the challenge now is getting the public to realise it, too. </p> <p>'It's a little bit of a difficult time for us new guys,' he says, by which he means Gustavo Kuerten, and Lleyton Hewitt and Juan Carlos Ferrero in particular, 'because no one actually knows us very well still. They still think that Pete and Andre are the only players to see. They don't realise we are around yet.'</p> <p>So does he think that it's time Sampras and Agassi called it a day? 'No,' he says, with his lugubrious Russian inflection, 'we need them for a while longer so people still come and the prize money stays high.' He smiles slowly. 'When the fans know us, then those guys can go quietly. . .'</p> <p>There are certain subjects that tennis players traditionally will not talk about in interview. These include their interior life; other players; romance; money; emotions; politics and ideas. The things they will talk about, in their place, generally involve the current trajectory of their ball toss, and the particular degree of their focus on the coming match. Among the press corps who witness the mandatory post-match interviews, Safin is considered something of an exception to this rule. Veterans of a thousand quote-free Q &amp; As with Henman ('he raised his level at a crucial time') or Hingis ('I raised my level at a crucial time') have warmed to the Russian - who doled out irony and vodka to the hacks in Flushing Meadow - as something of a raconteur. The distinction, you have to say, is a fine one, however.</p> <p>Safin can rattle off the story of his efforts to hold on to the No 1 ranking at the end of last year's Masters race in Muscovite shorthand - 'I make what I could; for the final I was unlucky; he was better this day. That's life' - and he has off-pat the particular reasons for his sluggish start to the season. His back, his back and his back. </p> <p>But ask him about life off court and he will tend to reply in a series of upbeat catch-all catchphrases, generally delivered with a raised eyebrow that hints at greater complexity: </p> <p>'I enjoy my life'</p> <p>'I just want to people to enjoy themselves'</p> <p>'I am very happy'</p> <p>'I just want to make everyone happy' </p> <p>In America, People magazine recently named Safin one of the 25 most intriguing people in the world, and in a way you can see its point. As an interviewee Safin serves up some of the same contradictions he reveals on court: he is both relaxed and intense, boyish and self-assured, all-conquering and oddly fragile.</p> <p>Some of this perhaps has to do with his upbringing. Like nearly all modern players, he was born into a tennis dynasty: his mother was a top 10 player in Russia , his father ran the Spartak club in Moscow, one of the very few serious tennis clubs in the Soviet Union at that time. Safin, who began playing aged three, was schooled in the regimen of Eastern Bloc sports stars, but when he was 13 his parents decided to take advantage of the liberalised political climate and sent him abroad, to a tennis school in Valencia, to develop his game further. There, he was taken under the wing of the Spanish coach Rafael Mensua, who seems to have instilled in Safin not only those enormous groundstrokes, but also a certain flexibility of thought. He was obliged nevertheless to fend for himself. Looking back, I wonder if he resented being sent away from his family at an early age?</p> <p>'No,' he says, eyebrow raised. 'I am very, very happy about that.'</p> <p>Why exactly?</p> <p>'I think as a guy you need a little bit to be on your own from early on, to start to live your own life, and try to understand what is going on around you, you have to be able to survive. . .'</p> <p>He contrasts his situation with that of his 14-year-old sister, who is the top-ranked Russian junior in an increasingly competitive field. 'My parents now work full-time to take care of her, because the most important thing of course is to make a family. They now try to give my sister the things I could not have because I was away.'</p> <p>Does he regret at all not having had that support himself?</p> <p>'No,' he says. 'I am happy. I am very, very happy that I did not have all these things. . .' (Later, when I speak to his sister, Dinara, who is playing in Spain, her mother in attendance, she seems to have inherited the family's capacity for boundless contentment: 'I am extremely happy to have Marat's example,' she says, 'and very happy to be playing my own game here, too.')</p> <p>When Safin started to achieve a measure of success, he left Spain and went to live in Monte Carlo, which is home to about half of the top ranked European players on the tour. It is also the power base of Ion Tiriac, the Romanian tennis svengali who was Ilie Nastase's doubles partner. Tiriac, whose company now manages Safin's business interests, compares him to a young Boris Becker, not so much in his style of play - for all his reach, the Russian still tends to win his points from the back of the court rather than at the net - but for the way he believes in 'the purity and simplicity of just playing tennis'.</p> <p>This faith seems to manifest itself in different ways: when things are going well it gives the Russian's game the promise of an almost beatific ease. But when things are going badly, as with Becker, it can unleash demons. At the end of his first punishing year on the tour, Safin admitted to having broken 48 rackets in anger, more than one per tournament. He puts this down now to 'the way I am', and the fact that 'no one likes to lose. I'm just trying to do all I can to beat the other guy. You get nervous and angry. But if you don't like to see the way I play, don't come.' (In fact, so certain are the tennis authorities that this violent emotion is, in fact, what crowds do want to see, and so anxious are they to create 'characters' in the game, that they have relaxed the laws on 'racket abuse', apparently for Safin's benefit.)</p> <p>For all this ferocious will to win, however, Safin remains the only player on the modern tour ever to have been pulled up for 'tanking' in matches: throwing games by not trying. He was fined $2,000 for this offence at the Australian Open last year: the referee suggesting that he gave up in his first-round match against the South African Grant Stafford, and apparently, on one point, caught his opponent's serve in his hand and tossed it back underarm. Safin denies this incident happened, and claims, still annoyed at the implication, that 'people made a bigger story from this than it was. The guy who handed out the fine, obviously he knows much more about tennis and much more about me than I do. He's a very smart guy. Very smart. . .'</p> <p>Still, such incidents point to a psychology somewhat at odds with Safin's laid-back off-court persona. Does he recognise the contradiction in himself?</p> <p>'Oh,' he smiles, predictably, these days he's 'very happy off court and on', and anyway he has been breaking far fewer rackets of late.</p> <p>Does he manage to find enough distractions in Monte Carlo? I wonder.</p> <p>He laughs a little: 'I try to do my best to have fun off the court,' he says. 'You are only 21 once. I am aware I will never get back to this time. You cannot make big parties, you cannot take cocaine or whatever, obviously, but there are plenty of other ways of having fun. And anything you can do you ought to do I think.'</p> <p>Such as? </p> <p>He searches for an appropriate vice, grinning. 'Oh, cars,' he says, 'cars, cars, cars, so many cars.'</p> <p>Does he ever find it hard to concentrate on playing?</p> <p>He looks around the room, studies the pool players, smiles at compatriot Yevgeny Kafelnikov, who is sitting at the next table, 'No,' he says finally, eyebrows raised. 'It's not hard to concentrate. It's all business to me and this business is a business I like very much.'</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/osm/story/0,6903,467995,00.html\">Read part two of Russian revolutionary here</a></p>",

This faith seems to manifest itself in different ways: when things are going well it gives the Russian's game the promise of an almost beatific ease. But when things are going badly, as with Becker, it can unleash demons. At the end of his first punishing year on the tour, Safin admitted to having broken 48 rackets in anger, more than one per tournament. He puts this down now to 'the way I am', and the fact that 'no one likes to lose. I'm just trying to do all I can to beat the other guy. You get nervous and angry. But if you don't like to see the way I play, don't come.' (In fact, so certain are the tennis authorities that this violent emotion is, in fact, what crowds do want to see, and so anxious are they to create 'characters' in the game, that they have relaxed the laws on 'racket abuse', apparently for Safin's benefit.) For all this ferocious will to win, however, Safin remains the only player on the modern tour ever to have been pulled up for 'tanking' in matches: throwing games by not trying. He was fined $2,000 for this offence at the Australian Open last year: the referee suggesting that he gave up in his first-round match against the South African Grant Stafford, and apparently, on one point, caught his opponent's serve in his hand and tossed it back underarm. Safin denies this incident happened, and claims, still annoyed at the implication, that 'people made a bigger story from this than it was. The guy who handed out the fine, obviously he knows much more about tennis and much more about me than I do. He's a very smart guy. Very smart. . .' Still, such incidents point to a psychology somewhat at odds with Safin's laid-back off-court persona. Does he recognise the contradiction in himself? 'Oh,' he smiles, predictably, these days he's 'very happy off court and on', and anyway he has been breaking far fewer rackets of late. Does he manage to find enough distractions in Monte Carlo? I wonder. He laughs a little: 'I try to do my best to have fun off the court,' he says. 'You are only 21 once. I am aware I will never get back to this time. You cannot make big parties, you cannot take cocaine or whatever, obviously, but there are plenty of other ways of having fun. And anything you can do you ought to do I think.' Such as? He searches for an appropriate vice, grinning. 'Oh, cars,' he says, 'cars, cars, cars, so many cars.' Does he ever find it hard to concentrate on playing? He looks around the room, studies the pool players, smiles at compatriot Yevgeny Kafelnikov, who is sitting at the next table, 'No,' he says finally, eyebrows raised. 'It's not hard to concentrate. It's all business to me and this business is a business I like very much.' Read part two of Russian revolutionary here",

The omens suggested that IT spending may grow by only 8 per cent in 2001, compared with a slowing 11 per cent growth last year, and that 14 per cent of companies would adjust their spending to match macro-economic conditions, adopting a more cautious 'wait and see' policy before releasing the greater part of any technology budget. </p> <p>Last month's figures from IDC confirmed fears that spending on technology products and services in the US had stalled, but IDC also reported that outside the US the outlook remains positive. </p> <p>With the US economy slowing, IDC believes that growth in US technology spending will be closer to 7 per cent this year.

'We took a record number of internet bets from Chinese punters, and a good proportion of them were for Red Marauder,' said Hills spokesman Graham Sharpe.</p> <p>Mason said: 'I was in tears. I was praying at every fence that he'd get over. I've never had such emotion in my life, apart from my wife giving birth, and I've never seen a race like it. He is such a lovely horse, doing everything Richard asked. It's down to him. He's a miracle worker.'</p> <p>It was a miracle that horses and jockeys escaped injury. The Racecourse Executive issued a self-righteous statement. 'We are in no doubt that the race should have taken place and we are of course very pleased that there were no significant equine or jockey injuries. The main problem was caused by loose horses, and not by horses falling.'</p> <p>However, Jockey Club spokesman John Maxse admitted: 'It was fairly shocking, uncomfortable viewing.' Horses that are effective over two and a half miles and jump indifferently are not expected to win the Grand National . </p> <p>Red Marauder defied the rules, winning in a time of almost 11 minutes, the slowest since Zoedone triumphed for his owner-rider Count Charles Kinsky in 1883. Then the fences were as upright as judges, and as unforgiving, so Red Marauder was relatively the slower.</p> <p>The preacher in Ecclesiastes observed: 'The race is not always to the swift, nor the battle to the strong...' Red Marauder was not the fastest winner of the Grand National , but few have been more resolute.</p>",

On asking why so many buildings in Chinatown were painted red, he was told that the Chinese regarded the colour as lucky, and he subsequently included red in his horses' names. If the 200m Chinese estimated to have watched the race live for the first time yesterday were bemused by the carnage, at least they were likely to have been pleased with the result. 'We took a record number of internet bets from Chinese punters, and a good proportion of them were for Red Marauder,' said Hills spokesman Graham Sharpe. Mason said: 'I was in tears. I was praying at every fence that he'd get over. I've never had such emotion in my life, apart from my wife giving birth, and I've never seen a race like it. He is such a lovely horse, doing everything Richard asked. It's down to him. He's a miracle worker.' It was a miracle that horses and jockeys escaped injury. The Racecourse Executive issued a self-righteous statement. 'We are in no doubt that the race should have taken place and we are of course very pleased that there were no significant equine or jockey injuries. The main problem was caused by loose horses, and not by horses falling.' However, Jockey Club spokesman John Maxse admitted: 'It was fairly shocking, uncomfortable viewing.' Horses that are effective over two and a half miles and jump indifferently are not expected to win the Grand National . Red Marauder defied the rules, winning in a time of almost 11 minutes, the slowest since Zoedone triumphed for his owner-rider Count Charles Kinsky in 1883. Then the fences were as upright as judges, and as unforgiving, so Red Marauder was relatively the slower. The preacher in Ecclesiastes observed: 'The race is not always to the swift, nor the battle to the strong...' Red Marauder was not the fastest winner of the Grand National , but few have been more resolute.",

Neither the Pentagon nor Richter's family like to call it a 'spy plane' but that is what it is: packed with the most advanced surveillance gear in America's arsenal.</p> <p>Richter's passion is archaeology - excavating ruins in Afghanistan and Egypt and finding a slave-burial ground in Manhattan. But it's a passion that didn't pay the bills so he joined the Navy five years ago, as a signals expert and digger for more contemporary records, operating more intensively of late above China's coastline.</p> <p>The plane had taken off from Japan's Okinawa Island shortly after dawn. The 21 men and three women aboard were unaware they were flying into the most serious stand-off between America and China since the Belgrade Embassy bombing - with far more serious implications. It is also the latest international controversy in George W. Bush's fledgling but brazen presidency and, indirectly, in America's aim to wrap the globe in a bellicose missile-defence screen.</p> <p>From out of the blue, Richter and his colleagues saw an unwelcome but not unfamiliar sight. US spy planes have become ever more closely shadowed by Chinese fighters in perilous games of high-speed cat-and-mouse. China, said the plane's squadron commander Capt William Marriot, has adopted a 'very, very aggressive posture in recent months'. Now, two F-8 jets advanced behind the Americans' left flank. The crew made a last call to base to say that they were being buzzed by the Chinese.</p> <p>At 8.45, pilot Wang Wei and his comrade-in-arms Zhao Yu had scrambled from their base knowing what to expect. China makes no bones about the frequency with which its pilots jockey in the skies with the 'crafty American devils'. An admiring account of the pilots' exploits was published only last week. The objective is to block the intruder from the landward side, flying parallel to steer it away from Chinese territory.</p> <p>Wang specialised in such jousting, and had become known to American intelligence as a 'hot-dog pilot' who once came so close the American crew was able to take a picture of him brandishing his email address. Wang boasted how a previous interception had taken 'several tens of minutes to drive the foreign aircraft off'. This time something went very wrong almost immediately.</p> <p>Wang's jet - according to the Americans - made a sudden and hostile dive beneath the EP-3. Richter's pilot banked to the left and the two collided, Wei's jet clipping the underbelly and left wing of the American plane.</p> <p>According to Zhao, he and Wang had flanked the EP-3 when it changed course twice. Wang's F-8, the closer of the two, was 300 metres away. The EP-3 swung sharply left and sliced off his tail plane with the outside left propeller.</p> <p>Zhao called on Wang to 'maintain attitude' but within 30 seconds the plane was out of control. Wang asked for permission to bale out. Zhao circled to lose height, just in time to see the plane hit the sea and the parachute follow.</p> <p>Wang was born in 1968 at Huzhou in East China's Zhejiang Province. His parents worked at a machine tools plant. He went to pilot school, married and has a 'little emperor', a six-year-old boy.</p> <p>The Americans fell 8,000ft before the pilot could steady the plane and make for the only runway within reach at Lingshui - a military airfield that does not appear on any Chinese map.</p> <p>First, they destroyed software and data, then set about the more complex task of obliterating the hardware. Officials say, however, that some material was 'locked' even to the crew.</p> <p>The People's Liberation Army does not lack the expertise to get at it, and with classic Cold War irony the EP-3 had landed on an island bristling with radar and communications networks to enforce China's claims to the South China Sea.</p> <p>Peasants in the lush semi-tropical countryside near Lingshui saw a grey-white plane heading in from the south-east. 'The propellers on the right-hand side were working hard,' local watchers told Chinese reporters. 'But the ones on the left had lost power, and the left wing had been crumpled.'</p> <p>The crew were taken from the plane under armed escort and driven to a guesthouse - the pilot was singled out and separated from the rest before bring reunited with them.</p> <p>The Defence Intelligence Agency says it tracks Chinese spy flights along the American Pacific coastline and admits openly that 'routine reconnaissance' flights patrol the Chinese coast, monitoring submarine movements and naval manoeuvres. Only a month ago, two US planes allegedly flew into the Yellow Sea to observe strategic exercises by the East China Fleet. Seen off by four fighters they returned to Okinawa.</p> <p>The next day the US stepped up the pressure, with two spy planes accompanied by four F-15 fighters. This time the Chinese fighters intercepted them backed up by two Sukhoi bombers.</p> <p>Beijing says that 63 US surveillance aircraft have been reported in Chinese coastal areas so far this year, and that the total last year was 950. Last Wednesday, 10 Chinese fighters allegedly faced off no fewer than five US planes.</p> <p>America has flown eavesdropping missions against China and North Korea for four decades, but for the riskiest ventures deep into Chinese airspace used Taiwanese pilots trained by the CIA. Documents declassified by the National Security Archive in Washington only this week show a long list of perilous stand-offs between the US and China.</p> <p>The effectiveness of spy planes has been questioned, with satellite surveillance able to analyse the Chinese nuclear arsenal in detail. Listening stations in South Korea, Japan and Australia intercept radio transmissions and telephone conversations. But the deployment of 'old-fashioned' agents working in China is on the increase and over the past three years the use of spy planes has been stepped up, a former National Security Agency official under the Clinton Administration conceded to The Observer this week. China is suspected of developing a sophisticated nuclear arsenal based on stolen technology.</p> <p>Although the case against the Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee collapsed into rubble and humiliation, the defendant never revealed why he had committed the offence of which he was convicted: 'mishandling national defence information' by spending 40 hours over 70 days transferring 400,000 pages of sensitive classified data on to an insecure computer system and high-volume cassettes.</p> <p>The DIA believes Chinese espionage has penetrated deep within Los Alamos and other installations. A Congressional committee concluded in 1999 that China was in possession of information on 'every currently deployed thermonuclear warhead in the US ballistics missile arsenal', and that a network of agents was operating through 3,000 front companies.</p> <p>China's goal, say officials briefing The Observer, is to build mobile long-range missiles that are difficult to detect and destroy. To this end, China stole secret design information about the American W-70 missile system during the early 1980s, and then the design templates for the most advanced weapon in the US nuclear arsenal, the W-88.</p> <p>The election of Bush marked a change in relations between China and the US. The Clinton Administration, anxious to develop trading ties with a market of 1.3 billion people, had avoided confrontation. But Bush moved rapidly with policies which angered the Chinese. Last weekend came the most radical rethinking in Pentagon priorities since the end of the Cold War, when Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld told the President that he saw US military interests no longer in terms of the European theatre, but across the Pacific towards China. America's weaponry and fighting capacity would be adapted accordingly.</p> <p>Even before this, determination to build an anti-missile screen was interpreted by China as a move to make a nuclear war winnable. The day before the incident off Hainan Island, a secret study by senior officers from the US Navy's Pacific Fleet reported to the National Security Agency inside the White House that Taiwan needed a significant infusion of sophisticated weapons systems, on which President Bush must adjudicate within weeks.</p> <p>The armoury heading for Taiwan includes the highly advanced Aegis radar system, whose primary use would be to protect the island's fleet from submarines. But the US knows full well, as do the Chinese, that a simple upgrade could bring a Taiwanese Aegis system into the American missile defence screen as a 'theatre' branch.</p> <p>That report was handed to Pentagon chiefs and the White House on Saturday, the day after President Jiang Zemin said that if the Aegis system was sold, he would accelerate the modernisation of China's arsenal. Within 24 hours, the spy plane was in his hands.</p> <p>Although the US called the incident a 'tragic military accident', Admiral Denis Blair, Commander in Chief of the Pacific Command, said pointedly: 'It's not normal practice to play bumper cars in the air.' China unequivocally blamed the US.</p> <p>President Bush meanwhile moved slowly from bellicosity towards more contrite language, reflecting divisions within his ranks between the competing claims of ideology and trade. Defence Secretary Rumsfeld, deputy Paul Wolfowitz and strategist Andrew Marshall, who wrote the 'China draft', are ideologists unafraid of confronting China, as is Vice-President Dick Cheney, even at the expense of trade relations.</p> <p>Cheney has even avoided consulting the President's father - a China expert and obvious candidate for credible envoy - preferring instead the hawk of hawks, Henry Kissinger.</p> <p>But officials on the State Department's China desk are 'not all the way in accord' with the White House's early hard line.

It is now in millions of homes after helping to spark off the craze for building your own furniture from a flat-pack. But MDF could pose a threat to health, according to some experts. A legal case has been launched against furniture chain MFI amid claims the product contains a carcinogenic chemical. Keith Day, 55, a manager of an aviation component company, bought some flat-pack wardrobes from MFI two years ago. Shortly after opening the pack, he allegedly started suffering from flu-like symptoms. 'When I entered the room my temperature rapidly went up, I had severe breathing difficulties, my skin and eyes starting burning, I had serious headaches and severe fatigue,' he said. 'At first I thought it was a virus, but it soon became clear it was linked to the house. Every time I left the house, the symptoms subsided.' Day was about to sell the house when a carpenter mentioned the effects of formaldehyde gas emitted from MDF products. MDF is made of wood dust and scrap bonded by a glue containing formaldehyde. Day bought some kits to test the level of formaldehyde in his bedroom. The test recorded high levels of the gas, well in excess of limits laid down by the World Health Organisation. He complained to MFI, which agreed to remove the wardrobes but refused to accept responsibility. Alerted to the possible risks of MDF by Day, Steve Payle, a trading standards expert, bought some similar wardrobe packs from MFI and tested them for formaldehyde emissions. These showed readings above the WHO-approved levels. Day began legal proceedings against MFI. Payle's unpublished report is in the hands of Day's solicitor. One of Payle's chief concerns is for parents of new babies who buy furniture made from MDF. He said: 'I am not in a position to comment on a case and I do not want to cause a safety scare, but I would advise parents who put up this furniture to ensure that the room is well ventilated.' The International Agency for Research on Cancer - part of the WHO - has quoted evidence that short-term exposure to formaldehyde, even at levels at far below the legal limit permissible in Britain, could cause irritation to the eyes, nose and throat. A Health and Safety Executive report stated: 'Formaldehyde can cause irritation of the eyes, nose and throat. In experimental studies in rats, formaldehyde causes nasal cancer. However there it no evidence that it has caused cancer either nasal or others in humans.' Two people who have suffered similar problems to Day after buying MFI flatpack furniture have agreed to be witnesses in the case. Gary Salter, from North London, suffered severe headaches and vomiting after buying wardrobes from MFI. He started sleeping in the spare room and the symptoms disappeared. He complained to MFI and was given a 100 per cent refund. Charles Begley, a publican, woke up with 'blinding headaches' and a face 'swollen up to the size of a balloon' after putting up MFI wardrobes. He was paid \u00a3150 in compensation. An MFI spokesperson told The Observer yesterday: 'We are unable to comment on Mr Day's case, as it \u00eds currently ongoing. Formaldehyde is a naturally occurring substance found in many materials, and we are in agreement with the 1997 Health and Safety Executive report stating there is no evidence that MDF poses a risk.'",

Reg Foster of the Daily Sketch and Brendan Mulholland of the Daily Mail refused to disclose their sources in stories about the Vassall spy case. They were sentenced to six months in prison.</p> <p><b> ABC trial - 1977</b></p> <p> Journalists Crispin Aubrey and Duncan Campbell charged under Section 2, as was an ex-soldier from a signals monitoring unit in Cyprus, whom they had interviewed. The journalists were each conditionally discharged the former soldier received a six-month suspended sentence.</p> <p><b> Sarah Tisdall - 1984</b></p> <p> Foreign Office clerk jailed for six months. She sent to the Guardian photocopies of two classified documents written by Michael Heseltine, then Defence Secretary, about the secret arrival in Britain of cruise missiles.</p> <p><b> Spycatcher - 1986</b></p> <p> Former MI5 agent Peter Wright claimed in his memoirs that the security services had sought to destabilise Harold Wilson's Government. The claims had already been made in print by spy writer Chapman Pincher, among others. But Spycatcher was injuncted in Britain. The government attempted - and spectacularly failed - to have it banned in courts around the world. British injunction eventually lifted.</p> <p><b> Zircon - 1987</b></p> <p> BBC succumbed to government pressure and withdrew TV documentary on Britain's plans to build its first spy satellite, codenamed Zircon. The decision caused political uproar months before a general election. Eventually the programme was shown in full.</p> <p><b> Tony Geraghty - 1999</b></p> <p> Charged under the 1989 Act for receiving confidential information after writing book The Irish War revealing the extent of covert army surveillance and MI5 dirty tricks in Northern Ireland. Geraghty argued that the information was embarassing rather than damaging to security and charges were eventually dropped as the MoD admitted this. Charges against one of Geraghty's alleged contacts, Colonel Nigel Wylde, remained under review for 11 months until journalist Duncan Campbell, expert witness for the defence, persuaded the CPS that there was insufficient evidence to proceed. </p> <p><b> Ed Moloney - 1999</b></p> <p> The Northern Ireland correspondent of the Dublin Sunday Tribune had interviewed a witness in the investigation into the murder of the human rights lawyer Pat Finucane, almost a decade earlier. The witness had become a suspect but, as the interview had been carried out in confidence, Moloney refused to hand over the details. He won his case on appeal and could have faced up to five years in jail had the original verdict not been reversed. Moloney said of his case - 'it has the makings of a landmark decision. The Lord Chief Justice has been quite clear that the police have to establish a case for needing to see journalistic material. They can't just wade in and assume they will automatically get it'.</p> <p><b>Martin Ingram, The Forces Research Unit</b><br> Martin Ingram, a pseudonymous former member of a clandestine army cell handling information about IRA and loyalist paramilitaries, was arrested under the Official Secrets Act after disclosing information about army dirty tricks to the Sunday Times - including the claim that FRU had broken into and burnt down an office used by John Stevens in 1990, during his investigaton into collusion between the army and loyalist terrorists. Ingram escaped prosecution when the charges were dropped last November.</p> <p><b>The Punch case, 2000</b> Following the Guardian/Observer Shayler case, Punch magazine was prosecuted for contempt of court for publishing an article by Shayler about the 1993 IRA bomb in the City of London, entitled 'MI5 could have stopped the bomb going off'. While the initial ruling against Punch found no evidence that the article damaged national security, the judge fined the magazine \u00a325,000,finding that Punch's publication of the article undermined the administration of justice and that the right of the attorney-general to be protected by the courts overruled the article 10 freedom of expression provision of the European Convention. <br></p> <p>On appeal, Lord Phillips, Master of the Rolls, overturned the ruling and said the attorney-general was 'behaving like a press censor' in a way which restricted freedom of expression in a way disproportionate to any public interest. The government was ordered to meet costs of more than \u00a3200,000.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Lansbury - 1934 The son of Labour leader George Lansbury prosecuted and fined pounds 20 for including in a memoir about his father two Cabinet memos on the unemployment situation. Foster and Mulholland - 1963 This was the last example of journalists going to prison for their principles. Reg Foster of the Daily Sketch and Brendan Mulholland of the Daily Mail refused to disclose their sources in stories about the Vassall spy case. They were sentenced to six months in prison. ABC trial - 1977 Journalists Crispin Aubrey and Duncan Campbell charged under Section 2, as was an ex-soldier from a signals monitoring unit in Cyprus, whom they had interviewed. The journalists were each conditionally discharged the former soldier received a six-month suspended sentence. Sarah Tisdall - 1984 Foreign Office clerk jailed for six months. She sent to the Guardian photocopies of two classified documents written by Michael Heseltine, then Defence Secretary, about the secret arrival in Britain of cruise missiles. Spycatcher - 1986 Former MI5 agent Peter Wright claimed in his memoirs that the security services had sought to destabilise Harold Wilson's Government. The claims had already been made in print by spy writer Chapman Pincher, among others. But Spycatcher was injuncted in Britain. The government attempted - and spectacularly failed - to have it banned in courts around the world. British injunction eventually lifted. Zircon - 1987 BBC succumbed to government pressure and withdrew TV documentary on Britain's plans to build its first spy satellite, codenamed Zircon. The decision caused political uproar months before a general election. Eventually the programme was shown in full. Tony Geraghty - 1999 Charged under the 1989 Act for receiving confidential information after writing book The Irish War revealing the extent of covert army surveillance and MI5 dirty tricks in Northern Ireland. Geraghty argued that the information was embarassing rather than damaging to security and charges were eventually dropped as the MoD admitted this. Charges against one of Geraghty's alleged contacts, Colonel Nigel Wylde, remained under review for 11 months until journalist Duncan Campbell, expert witness for the defence, persuaded the CPS that there was insufficient evidence to proceed. Ed Moloney - 1999 The Northern Ireland correspondent of the Dublin Sunday Tribune had interviewed a witness in the investigation into the murder of the human rights lawyer Pat Finucane, almost a decade earlier. The witness had become a suspect but, as the interview had been carried out in confidence, Moloney refused to hand over the details. He won his case on appeal and could have faced up to five years in jail had the original verdict not been reversed. Moloney said of his case - 'it has the makings of a landmark decision. The Lord Chief Justice has been quite clear that the police have to establish a case for needing to see journalistic material. They can't just wade in and assume they will automatically get it'. Martin Ingram, The Forces Research Unit Martin Ingram, a pseudonymous former member of a clandestine army cell handling information about IRA and loyalist paramilitaries, was arrested under the Official Secrets Act after disclosing information about army dirty tricks to the Sunday Times - including the claim that FRU had broken into and burnt down an office used by John Stevens in 1990, during his investigaton into collusion between the army and loyalist terrorists. Ingram escaped prosecution when the charges were dropped last November. The Punch case, 2000 Following the Guardian/Observer Shayler case, Punch magazine was prosecuted for contempt of court for publishing an article by Shayler about the 1993 IRA bomb in the City of London, entitled 'MI5 could have stopped the bomb going off'. While the initial ruling against Punch found no evidence that the article damaged national security, the judge fined the magazine \u00a325,000,finding that Punch's publication of the article undermined the administration of justice and that the right of the attorney-general to be protected by the courts overruled the article 10 freedom of expression provision of the European Convention. On appeal, Lord Phillips, Master of the Rolls, overturned the ruling and said the attorney-general was 'behaving like a press censor' in a way which restricted freedom of expression in a way disproportionate to any public interest. The government was ordered to meet costs of more than \u00a3200,000.",

      "body": "<p>When books make news, it's usually less for the gorgeous texture of their prose than for the colour of the money they have generated. Bold and eyecatching literary innovations make reviews; big advances make headlines. Sometimes the two are linked. </p> <p>The usually placid waters of the London Book Fair were disturbed last week by a flurry of excitement for a novel, The Impressionist, by unknown Hari Kunzru, a 30-year-old who apparently walked away with a cool million dollars. </p> <p>What press reports of such deals rarely acknowledge is the reality behind such figures. For example, Kunzru's loot will be paid out in two, or possibly three, stages (signature, hardback and, finally, paperback publication). At each pay-out, he will be giving away between 10 and 20 per cent to his agent. After tax, his riches beyond the dreams of avarice will look more like the small potatoes a successful young account executive might complain about in Groucho's to his co-workers.</p> <p>Compared to the advances recently bagged by some celebrities, it's downright miserly. According to the Bookseller, British publishers have been on quite a spree this spring. There's Richard and Judy - \u00a3600,000 from Hodder and Stoughton. Bingo! There's comedian Frank Skinner - \u00a3750,000 from Century. Jackpot! Next to the \u00a31.3 million reportedly bestowed on motor-racing commentator Murray Walker by HarperCollins, both these deals look distinctly threadbare. </p> <p>The conventional wisdom for such books is that if they are to earn out an advance of, say, \u00a3500,000 they have to sell between 150,000 and 200,000 copies, first in hardback and then in paperback. In a comparatively small book-market like Britain, this is a tall order. When Hodder &amp; Stoughton paid \u00a31.25m for Alex Ferguson's Managing My Life, many said that the editorial board of Hodder had gone mad. In the event, it was in profit long before the paperback was piled high in Tesco and Asda. </p> <p>The commercial logic behind such deals is the conglomerates' need to find big-selling titles to satisfy the appetites of their sales machines.

      "bodyText": "When books make news, it's usually less for the gorgeous texture of their prose than for the colour of the money they have generated. Bold and eyecatching literary innovations make reviews; big advances make headlines. Sometimes the two are linked. The usually placid waters of the London Book Fair were disturbed last week by a flurry of excitement for a novel, The Impressionist, by unknown Hari Kunzru, a 30-year-old who apparently walked away with a cool million dollars. What press reports of such deals rarely acknowledge is the reality behind such figures. For example, Kunzru's loot will be paid out in two, or possibly three, stages (signature, hardback and, finally, paperback publication). At each pay-out, he will be giving away between 10 and 20 per cent to his agent. After tax, his riches beyond the dreams of avarice will look more like the small potatoes a successful young account executive might complain about in Groucho's to his co-workers. Compared to the advances recently bagged by some celebrities, it's downright miserly. According to the Bookseller, British publishers have been on quite a spree this spring. There's Richard and Judy - \u00a3600,000 from Hodder and Stoughton. Bingo! There's comedian Frank Skinner - \u00a3750,000 from Century. Jackpot! Next to the \u00a31.3 million reportedly bestowed on motor-racing commentator Murray Walker by HarperCollins, both these deals look distinctly threadbare. The conventional wisdom for such books is that if they are to earn out an advance of, say, \u00a3500,000 they have to sell between 150,000 and 200,000 copies, first in hardback and then in paperback. In a comparatively small book-market like Britain, this is a tall order. When Hodder &amp; Stoughton paid \u00a31.25m for Alex Ferguson's Managing My Life, many said that the editorial board of Hodder had gone mad. In the event, it was in profit long before the paperback was piled high in Tesco and Asda. The commercial logic behind such deals is the conglomerates' need to find big-selling titles to satisfy the appetites of their sales machines. Up and down the food-chain, publishers know that if they are to survive from season to season, they must have at least one biannual hit. To achieve this, publishers can opt either to hoover up new talent (like Hari Kunzru) in the hope that sooner rather than later the goose will lay a golden egg. Interestingly, the people who've acquired Hari Kunzru are the same ones who struck it rich with Zadie Smith's White Teeth. Or they can play a kind of literary roulette with celebrity memoirs. In both cases, there's plenty of opportunity for coming unstuck. Little Brown is still licking its wounds from the failure of Anthea Turner's memoirs.

      "body": "<p>Something odd and significant happened last week. The Independent newspaper put its weekday price up to 50p (from 35p on Mondays and 45p from Tuesday to Friday). Very odd timing, as we shall see; and significantly underplayed by rivals. Yet thus, perhaps, endeth the eight-year war. </p> <p>New, young readers start here. You think, when you journey across Europe, that British broadsheets are cheap - maybe two-thirds the cost of their continental equivalents? It was not always so. </p> <p>In the summer of 1993, Rupert Murdoch, frustrated by the Times' lack of progress under his ownership, took an axe to its cover price. He made it 30p through the week (and subsequently 10p on Mondays). The Telegraph, Guardian and Independent - charging 15p more - watched in horror as the Times' sales surged - 362,000 in June 1993 became 524,000 twelve months on. The march to 800,000 and beyond seemed inexorable. </p> <p>Who was in the firing line? No doubt about that. Murdoch's aim was to pass the Telegraph and the million mark, at which point the Times would make pots of advertising money and Conrad Black would succumb to terminal apoplexy. But there was also collateral damage to the Indie. The highest tide of Independent's fortunes - 422,000 in 1990 - was long past, but the paper was still selling 325,000 when Murdoch struck. It soon slid under 300,000 and has not recovered. In February this year sales stood at 224,000. </p> <p>Some of the damage was probably inevitable. The newest paper had fewer loyal readers to hang on to in a crisis. But some of it was self-inflicted as the Indie, playing Grand Old Duke of York, marched up the hill to a 50p level and promptly marched down again. The high moral line against price-cutting didn't hold; the years since have been peppered with one-off bargains and 35p Mondays. </p> <p>Last week all that went by the board, too. The Independent is now the most expensive of the feuding four (and a full 15p more than the Times, precisely the gap that first brought it grief). This, on the face of it, is a bizarre moment to move. Broadsheet sales generally have had a soggy, miserable winter. An everlasting election campaign is already depressing them further. Shifting just before the Easter holiday - when readers go on holiday and cancel their orders anyway - defies all circulation wisdom. What's going on? </p> <p>The simple answer, as ever, is probably the best. Sir Tony O'Reilly's Independent News and Media may recently have posted more record profits, but the stock market wasn't impressed. When O'Reilly tells shareholders that it is 'too early to forecast an outcome for the current year in view of global market uncertainty' he reflects, all too clearly, the difficulty of making his mini-empires in South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland and Britain march in step. The losses on the Independent and Independent on Sunday may have come down to between \u00a32 million and \u00a33m a year, but newsprint prices are going up 15 per cent, and advertising grows harder to find. </p> <p>So, at last, the price lever gets pulled. But where O'Reilly leads, will others follow? All of the contending groups, to greater or lesser extents, feel the same pressures. If the Guardian, Times and Telegraph took the opportunity to bring in some sales cash, then - relatively at least - there may be no great harm. Maybe their silence about the issue portends debates in progress. Opportunity knocks - it is time to be realistic about cover prices - or it passes by. </p> <p>Does 50p on the masthead help Telegraph finances? Not as much as you'd suppose. Nearly half its circulation is made up of subscriptions, bulks and foreign supplies. We're talking 5p extra on 572,000 copies, not 1,011,000. The Guardian, 45p for almost a decade except on Saturdays, is expanding that weekend edition again this month. The Times took a dip when it moved from 30p to 35p and Murdoch won't like it sinking below 600,000. </p> <p>The problem for all four papers is through-the-week sales, with varying peaks and troughs and scant sign of a steady weekday state. It requires either great courage or great desperation to exacerbate that decline in the current circumstances. O'Reilly could find himself alone for many months yet - and even if he isn't, a concerted move up would still leave multiple buyers knocking the weakest link off their paper chain. </p> <p>The trickiest question of the lot would seem, then, to be back in play. What exactly is O'Reilly's strategy for his two London nationals? As far as eloquent words and vivid pictures go, they are well regarded and gather their share of prizes. Simon Kelner is a solid, professional editor. But full-rate sales are still falling - to just 148,000 in the UK and Ireland (as against 178,000 last year) and the story on the Sunday (156,000 full-raters) is little better. There's no earthly reason to expect a surge at 50p; just the reverse. Saving the invention of some Telegraph-style subscription scheme, the two Independents face more years on a life support system. </p> <p>Of course O'Reilly has the resources and resolve to keep going, but his end game is harder to discern. His Independents are at the bottom of their respective leagues, and thus most vulnerable when economies sour.

For Gui Chan, the dream was always the same: he would make his way from a dingy bedsit in Birmingham to Chinatown in central London where Quan, his younger brother, would be waiting to meet him.</p> <p>After embracing, the brothers would head for an evening train to Birmingham. Within hours, they would be discussing their plans for a life in Britain and drinking to memories of their childhood in China's Fujian province.</p> <p>It was not to be. Instead, Chan was this weekend reflecting on the harrowing last moments of his brother's life and regretting the day he suggested paying the people-smugglers known as 'snake heads' to get him from China to Europe.</p> <p>While Gui Chan had successfully made it two years earlier, it was only a matter of time before the journey undertaken by thousands of immigrants each year ended in tragedy. On 18 June last year, Quan and 57 other Chinese suffocated in a lorry on its way by ferry to Dover.</p> <p>Last week, Perry Wacker, a 33-year-old Dutch lorry driver, was jailed for 14 years for manslaughter. It emerged that after boarding the ferry at Zeebrugge for the five-hour crossing, he had deliberately shut off the only air vent to stop noise from filtering out. It was the hottest night of the year.</p> <p>At Dover, Wacker's Mercedes-Benz truck was opened up by customs officers. Corpses, including Quan's, littered the cramped container. Most of the victims had torn their clothes off; others had tried to claw their way out. Two had survived, though they were barely alive.</p> <p>Most of the victims had paid up to \u00a320,000 to end up in the back of Wacker's lorry. With 60 people crammed inside, the 'snakeheads' had already collected \u00a31.2m million from the human cargo. Wacker's cut was \u00a3500 for each person he successfully delivered, netting a payout of \u00a330,000.</p> <p>Gui Chan spoke with sadness last week about how he had convinced his brother to take a fatal chance. Now in hiding after helping Kent police with their investigation, he says the advice he gave Quan still haunts him.</p> <p>In Budapest, the Hungarian capital, Quan had been detained by immigration officials. But the 'snakeheads' secured his release from a refugee detention centre after apparently paying an official and he called his brother for advice on his next move. Last week, as Gui sat in the office of a London lawyer, he sobbed as he told how he had advised his brother to head for Britain. 'You have no choice in Budapest,' he told Quan. 'You have to move on. There is no way back once you reach Hungary. And there is no way to know your fate from there on.'</p> <p>Gui, 38, leaving behind his wife and two children, agreed to pay \u00a39,000 to go to Hungary in 1998. In a small hotel in Beijing, the criminal gang behind the scheme gave him a false passport, with an immaculate visa stamp for entrance into Hungary. He said he asked no questions and boarded the Aeroflot plane to Budapest.</p> <p>The Chinese market in the east of Pest is full of immigrants in search of home comforts as well as passage to the UK. The immaculate visas Gui and his brother received were obtained through a network of 'snakehead' contacts in Hungary. A source at the visa department of the Ministry for the Interior told The Observer last week how Chinese businessmen court visa workers. 'They give workers mobile phones, just so they can call them up and ask for \"help\",' said a source. 'They buy them meals and gifts - rarely giving them money at first. It's simple to issue a visa through official channels, but never record its existence.'</p> <p>Gui said he waited days in a half-way house in Budapest before being packed on to a lorry heading west. The lorry stopped and the group was marched across mountains into what was probably Austria. There, two men with hunting rifles loaded them on to another truck.</p> <p>After arriving in Kent, Gui telephoned his family in Fujian who paid the gang for transporting him to the UK a total of \u00a317,000. He was marched to a waiting taxi which took him to Chinatown in London. After a series of manual jobs he found work with a building company in Birmingham while his asylum application was considered.</p> <p>When Quan died, it was Gui who broke the news to the family. The body was shipped back to China, among 58 wooden coffins laid out on the tarmac of Beijing airport.</p> <p>For Gui, the future is uncertain. His asylum application is not guaranteed and his testimony to police means that, if the snakeheads catch up with him, he faces death or injury. 'I was so desperate to leave China. You have no option with the government on your back. After my brother's death, the situation in China was exposed. But, since I have spoken out, the snakeheads have been looking for me. Their grip never seems to end.'</p> <p>Pal Nyiri, a senior research fellow at Oxford University, said: 'The Chinese do not normally fear the people who arrange the trip. They are providing a service. Yes, it is expensive and sometimes dangerous, but it is an investment the Chinese think they can recoup from working in a better economy.'</p> <p>He added: 'Few Chinese are surprised at being threatened when they don't pay up. In their minds, they have reneged on the deal. After all, it was not the snakeheads who killed the 58 people, it was the man who closed the vent.'</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:nick.walsh@observer.co.uk\">nick.walsh@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

Now in hiding after helping Kent police with their investigation, he says the advice he gave Quan still haunts him. In Budapest, the Hungarian capital, Quan had been detained by immigration officials. But the 'snakeheads' secured his release from a refugee detention centre after apparently paying an official and he called his brother for advice on his next move. Last week, as Gui sat in the office of a London lawyer, he sobbed as he told how he had advised his brother to head for Britain. 'You have no choice in Budapest,' he told Quan. 'You have to move on. There is no way back once you reach Hungary. And there is no way to know your fate from there on.' Gui, 38, leaving behind his wife and two children, agreed to pay \u00a39,000 to go to Hungary in 1998. In a small hotel in Beijing, the criminal gang behind the scheme gave him a false passport, with an immaculate visa stamp for entrance into Hungary. He said he asked no questions and boarded the Aeroflot plane to Budapest. The Chinese market in the east of Pest is full of immigrants in search of home comforts as well as passage to the UK. The immaculate visas Gui and his brother received were obtained through a network of 'snakehead' contacts in Hungary. A source at the visa department of the Ministry for the Interior told The Observer last week how Chinese businessmen court visa workers. 'They give workers mobile phones, just so they can call them up and ask for \"help\",' said a source. 'They buy them meals and gifts - rarely giving them money at first. It's simple to issue a visa through official channels, but never record its existence.' Gui said he waited days in a half-way house in Budapest before being packed on to a lorry heading west. The lorry stopped and the group was marched across mountains into what was probably Austria. There, two men with hunting rifles loaded them on to another truck. After arriving in Kent, Gui telephoned his family in Fujian who paid the gang for transporting him to the UK a total of \u00a317,000. He was marched to a waiting taxi which took him to Chinatown in London. After a series of manual jobs he found work with a building company in Birmingham while his asylum application was considered. When Quan died, it was Gui who broke the news to the family. The body was shipped back to China, among 58 wooden coffins laid out on the tarmac of Beijing airport. For Gui, the future is uncertain. His asylum application is not guaranteed and his testimony to police means that, if the snakeheads catch up with him, he faces death or injury. 'I was so desperate to leave China. You have no option with the government on your back. After my brother's death, the situation in China was exposed. But, since I have spoken out, the snakeheads have been looking for me. Their grip never seems to end.' Pal Nyiri, a senior research fellow at Oxford University, said: 'The Chinese do not normally fear the people who arrange the trip. They are providing a service. Yes, it is expensive and sometimes dangerous, but it is an investment the Chinese think they can recoup from working in a better economy.' He added: 'Few Chinese are surprised at being threatened when they don't pay up. In their minds, they have reneged on the deal. After all, it was not the snakeheads who killed the 58 people, it was the man who closed the vent.' nick.walsh@observer.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>The guests are enjoying themselves on this sunny afternoon in downtown Los Angeles, sipping their chardonnay and appreciating the view from the corporate headquarters of a successful show business lawyer. There's Benicio Del Toro and Tim Roth and Christopher Penn. And now it's time for their host to thank them for coming to this exclusive little gathering to celebrate the merging of two of Hollywood's most powerful law firms. But something odd is happening. Who asked these people? What the devil is going on? </p> <p>The real hosts of this party are not the besuited, self-assured legal eagles but one of the last people you might expect to find at a flash LA party: Ken Loach, the director who perhaps more than any other British film-maker represents the antithesis of the Hollywood culture. </p> <p>Loach is filming a scene for Bread and Roses, his first and, one senses, probably his last film to be shot in the United States. Its theme is the highly topical one in America of illegal immigration and union organisation; of the gap between rich and poor. It weaves this into a cross-cultural love story between a middle-class union organiser, played by Adrien Brody, and a Mexican office cleaner and illegal immigrant, played by Pilar Padilla. </p> <p> The seed of the film was sown in the mind of the Glaswegian writer Paul Laverty in the early hours of a Beverly Hills morning some years ago. Laverty, who wrote the screenplays for two other Ken Loach films, Carla's Song and My Name Is Joe, was in Los Angeles on a Fulbright scholarship. 'To cut a long story short,' says Laverty, 'on my first week, I went to a party, something fancy, in Beverly Hills. I was waiting at the bus stop to go home and I noticed all these people from central America.' Laverty, who had worked as a lawyer in Nicaragua and spoke Spanish, started chatting to them. 'It was this very odd image - these people were working at some of the richest real estate in Los Angeles and having to wait for hours to get a bus home at night. They were an invisible army working for some of the richest lawyers and agents in the world.' </p> <p>Soon afterwards Laverty was listening to LA's left-wing radio station, KPFK, and heard that an organisation called Justice for Janitors, which represents the people who hoover the corporate carpet and scrub its toilet bowl, was holding a meeting. He decided to go along and met some of the cleaners organising a campaign for better wages and conditions. </p> <p>'One of the things that struck me very strongly was that many of them came from central America,' says Laverty. 'They were very vulnerable because many of them were undocumented and couldn't speak English and at the same time they were involved in one of the most imaginative guerrilla-like campaigns within the labour movement. I liked their energy.' </p> <p>For Loach, it was not only the story that was a challenge but the idea of shooting in a place that did not seem too sympathetic either to his concerns or his collegiate style of working. This was his first film-making experience in North America and he has no regrets about having left it to this stage in his film-making life. </p> <p>'If I was ever going to move it would have been years ago. I was kind of courted in the early Seventies by the odd producer but it seemed the wrong move at the time - young family and so on,' says Loach, talking at the film's humble headquarters, aptly situated just off Union Street. 'And it's always been the European cinema that I find interesting so I didn't pursue it. I think it's very rare that people come here and their work becomes a lot better. Usually people come here and their work is is a lot worse.' </p> <p>Loach brought with him six of his regular team, including his director of photography Barry Ackroyd - 'that was crucial' - but was full of praise for the American crew on Bread and Roses: 'The assistant directors and everyone around the cameras have been enormously committed and tried to make it work for us but there are certain things that have just been very heavy - the bureaucracy, all that \"you can stand here, you can't stand there.\" The crew is probably 50 per cent larger than we would have back home and yet the actual equipment we've got is ramshackle. The camera is the worst camera equipment we've had for years.' </p> <p>Still, the budget is low at around $5 million. 'People have told us that you can't make a good film for that sort of money in Los Angeles and we have really struggled. There have been days when I know we have needed to have another half day to shoot but we just don't have the time. We really have struggled to get it in on time so you have to say: \"Well, it's OK, it's near enough, we'll just have to move on,\" but that's not very satisfactory.' </p> <p>There is an irony about being weighed down by union requirements while making a film about unions but Loach is sympathetic: 'The crews are very big but one can understand why that is because the industrial films are being made in such a way that people are ripping off huge amounts from the top - the production companies, the studio overheads, the stars' fees, they all take a huge amount - so the people who actually make it say quite rightly: \"Why shouldn't we have some of it?\"' </p> <p>The idea of the janitors attracted Loach immediately when Paul Laverty told him about it. 'It seemed to reveal a lot of elements that were worth discussing. There seemed to be a new generation of new organisers within the community who were very opposed to the old, middle-aged, white, slightly redneck unions that one associated with the States and there seemed to be a genuinely radical place for organised labour which was community-based.' </p> <p>Despite reservations about the logistical difficulties of the project, Loach couldn't resist the challenge. Who else would be making a film about the benefits of union organisation in 2001, when union membership in the US workforce hovers around the 13 per cent mark? </p> <p>But the problems in working in LA were offset by other factors, Loach says: 'The pleasure has been working with the Latinos, the janitors, and finding great characters among them. It has been like working with the Women Against Pit Closures. They are the same women; you could put them in the same room, apart from the language. The jokes are the same, the characters are the same, the defiance is the same. Everything is universal and that has been terrific. You come in in the morning and there is Mayron [Payes, an organiser for the day labourers] beaming and that's a pleasure.' </p> <p>Payes is but one of the many real-life union activists in the film. He plays the part of Ben, a young janitor from El Salvador who is committed to the union. He revelled in the part. In real life he tirelessly organises workers, arranges lawyers for those who are not documented and works out ways to ensure they are paid. </p> <p>Loach had little time to see much of LA while he was there. Apart from Tim Roth, a guest in the film's party scene, he knows few people in the film world here. 'I know Joel and Ethan Coen as friends and what they do I enjoy. John Sayles I enjoy because of the subject matter, although film-wise we work in very different ways. But most people can't understand why we're doing a film on this subject - it's not \"what the movies are about\". There is absolute puzzlement and surprise which is one reason I have difficulty socialising with the film community here because if people are surprised then we haven't got much in common.' Will he be back, if not for Bread and Roses II then for another project? </p> <p>'I think it's a one-off. I can't imagine coming back, not to this city,' says Loach. 'It is difficult to do good work here. That's the problem. It's not very exciting in terms of the actual craft, the medium. The day-to-day business of working is just very hard and one can work better in Europe.' </p> <p>Whether many Americans will have a chance to see Bread and Roses remains to be seen. It won the Phoenix prize, awarded to the film that best celebrates 'the outsider', at the Santa Barbara international film festival last month, but Loach's films have tended to be shunted off into a siding in the States. My Name Is Joe had to be sub-titled because of the Scottish accents. He was also very disappointed that Crissy Rock did not receive an Oscar nomination for Ladybird, Ladybird in 1994 after winning the best actress award in Berlin. </p> <p>Peter Rainer, the film critic of New York magazine, says Loach is admired by those who know his films for his refusal to compromise. 'He gets points from a lot of people because he has never sold out. His films don't get very widely distributed here but they are highly regarded among critics, especially among socially active ones who feel movies should have a higher purpose than just a commercial one. And he does have his supporters here - Robert Duvall is a huge fan.' </p> <p>As it happens, Loach's timing could not have been better. Not long after the shoot finished, the janitors were on the streets of LA for real, striking and campaigning for a wage increase. Their marches brought downtown LA to a standstill and attracted the sympathy of politicians, including Senator Ted Kennedy and the LA Times. </p> <p>After some sabre-rattling, the employers caved in to a majority of the demands and agreed a 25 per cent pay increase over three years. No sooner had the janitor succeeded than the hotel workers, also underpaid and often ignored, were on the streets. LA had become and continues to be probably the most vibrant union city in the States. Loach had hoped to release Bread and Roses at the height of the janitors' dispute last year but the release date was set. He is nonetheless optimistic about the film's chances and cheered by the response of the janitors and organisers. 'They said they were very happy - but of course people are polite,' he said from London a few months after shooting stopped. </p> <p> After Mayron saw Bread and Roses, I teased him about the possibility that Hollywood producers would be knocking on his door when the film is released. Making the film, he says, had been \" 'like falling in love, like finding the woman you know is right for you. It has transformed my life.\"' And he beams. Whatever happens to the film, whatever it makes at the box office or whatever the critics may write, one feels that that sunny smile would have been reward enough for Ken Loach.</p> <p><strong>The life of Loach</strong></p> <p><strong>Born:</strong> Nuneaton, 1936 </p> <p><strong>Early career:</strong> After studying law at Oxford, he joined the BBC and directed episodes of shows, including Z Cars.

It's funny enough, in a girl-behaving-badly sort of way, although her attempt to pass it off as a celebration of a part of British life that traditionally receives bad press might be more believable if she didn't put the boot (or white court shoe) in with quite such glee. </p> <p><strong>Ariel's Gift</strong><br>Erica Wagner<br>Faber &amp; Faber \u00a38.99, pp224<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000472558,00.html\">Buy it at a discount at BOL</a></p> <p>Ted Hughes's Birthday Letters, published in the last year of his life, re-ignited the heated debate over his relationship with Sylvia Plath that had continued to burn ever since her suicide in 1963. The cycle of poems, addressed almost entirely to his first wife, broke the public silence Hughes had till then maintained regarding their troubled marriage, and Plath's early death. In Ariel's Gift, Wagner attempts to provide a commentary to Birthday Letters by setting the poems in the context not just of the events they sprang from, but also examining how they illuminate, and are illuminated by, Plath's own writing. Part-biography of the turbulent Plath-Hughes relationship, part-study of the poems themselves, Wagner's book neither condones nor condemns, but offers a thoughtful and reasoned insight into Hughes's most intimate work. </p> <p><strong>English Passengers</strong><br>Matthew Kneale<br>Penguin \u00a36.99, pp462<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000459025,00.html\">Buy it at a discount at BOL</a></p> <p>With a narrative made up from more than 20 separate voices, it might be expected that this winner of the Whitbread Book of the Year would be either fragmentary or confusing.

The novel follows parallel and ultimately converging strands, one concerning a hapless expedition to Tasmania to find the Garden of Eden in the 1850s, the other the struggle of a group of Tasmanian Aborigines to survive the ethnic cleansing of the colonising British. The comedy of the first, where the blinkered and bickering passengers remain unaware they've chartered a Manx smuggling ship, underscores the horror of the native Tasmanians' fate as disease and ill-treatment steadily reduces the island's aboriginal population.

      "byline": "Daphne Merkin",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Nuala O'Faolain is making up for lost time. It has been a meteoric five years since the 60-year-old journalist banged out her tentatively titled memoir, Are You Somebody?, in an inspired two months spent sitting at a wooden table in her one-bedroom cottage in County Clare. The book, which had an initial print run of 1,500 copies, remained on the Irish bestseller list for six months before it was bought for a pittance, presumably without great expectations, and became a bestseller around the world as well. </p> <p>O'Faolain's first novel, My Dream of You, comes out this week in Britain, and hopes are that it will be one of those rare crossover books that has both literary ambitions and wide commercial appeal. The novel is narrated by Kathleen, a middle-aged writer who is fiercely independent but lovelorn - a character who sounds very much like the author - and whose 'misunderstanding of passion' has led her on a lifelong search for a man who will provide both loving companionship and sexual bliss.</p> <p>The slightly meandering plot follows Kathleen to the remote village of Ballygall, where she has gone to research an obscure historical scandal known as the Talbot Judgment - involving a liaison between an Irish groom and an upper-class Anglo-Irish wife - which took place during the Great Famine of the 1840s. As the story navigates between Kathleen's own sense of romantic dislocation and the tightly constructed historical subplot, it speaks in naked and direct ways to women who are no longer young and firm-fleshed but who still keep 'a vigil outside the shrine of Eros'. After an unexpected one-night stand with a man she meets on a ferry, Kathleen broods: 'What if I never have another lover? What if I have to go the whole way to the grave without ever making love again?' </p> <p>Had the author not given a remarkably unzipped account of her own life and loves when she appeared on Ireland's top-rated chat show to promote her memoir, Are You Somebody? might never have become a literary sensation. The interview began on a startling note, with the host, Gay Byrne, nosily asking, 'You've slept with a lot of men, haven't you?' To which O'Faolain shot back: 'Only three that ever mattered, which is modest for a woman of my age.' </p> <p>The conversation steamed along from there, delving into the sort of damaging family history that most of Ireland's 'fretful, conscious citizenry', as O'Faolain once described it, didn't talk about but longed to hear discussed. She recalls that she appeared on the show in 'a rictus of terror', having prepared for it by giving up drinking and taking up exercising four weeks earlier, as well as praying to 'a God I didn't believe in'. Once on camera, she quickly charmed her way into the studio audience's hearts - 'I could feel them on my side,' she says - and within no time, Are You Somebody? was being sold straight from boxes before it even reached the shelves. </p> <p>The use of the word 'accidental' in the memoir's subtitle, The Accidental Memoir of a Dublin Woman, was not just a clever marketing ploy to catch the reader's attention. The book was, in fact, originally conceived of as no more than a grace note, an introduction to a collection of O'Faolain's widely read pieces from the Irish Times. 'I was ashamed,' she says, 'of reprinting columns with ancient arguments in them. It's the most pitiful form of bookmaking.' Once she decided to write an introduction, she explains, 'I had to answer the question nobody had asked: where do my opinions come from? The answer was simple: ideology had nothing to do with it. My opinions come from my life.' Despite her fears about writing in a private voice - 'You don't get to be an Irish woman of my age and say \"I, I, I\" with any confidence, because \"I\" has been frightened out of you' - the introduction swelled to 200 intensely personal pages. 'I sneaked out my autobiography when no one was looking,' she says, sounding like a child caught reading by torch under the sheets. 'My unconscious recognised a chance.' </p> <p>O'Faolain made her name for more than a decade as a maverick pundit at the Irish Times, where she expressed her often discomforting views about 'this damp little shambles of a democracy on the edge of the Western world'. The editor of the paper, Conor Brady, who offered O'Faolain her own column on a hunch after hearing her interviewed on the radio about her work as a producer of a magazine-style television series called Women Talking, was struck by her ability to 'infuse ordinary people's everyday activities with value and interest'. (O'Faolain prefers to shape her story - somewhat disingenuously - with a dramatic Cinderella twist, in which Brady plays the Prince Charming character; to hear her tell it, she was a middle-aged washout when he offered her the job out of the blue.)</p> <p>Within weeks of hiring her, Brady's instinct proved right. 'She just took off,' he recalls. 'She'd get these amazing mailbags from people because she touched something very elemental in their lives.' Her public voice was politicised without being doctrinaire; she could be as ardently outspoken as Germaine Greer, but her perspective was softened by bursts of humour and the Irish gift for lyrical lament that is so evident in the fiction of Edna O'Brien. (In a column called 'Birth', O'Faolain described the quiet, vigilant atmosphere of an intensive-care maternity ward in which 'you hear the silence of the babies. You long for them to cry, but they can't cry, because they are sedated. Tiny little starfish things, literal scraps of life.') </p> <p>With clear-eyed affection, O'Faolain registered the hidebound habits of mind - 'the florid national inefficiency' - she saw around her. 'She has a great capacity,' Brady observes, 'to force us to confront some of the illusions we like to have about ourselves in Ireland - that this is, for instance, a very good society in which to bring up children.' O'Faolain commented on the political issues of the day as well as on the ongoing vicissitudes such as domestic violence, Irish homophobia, the iron grip of Catholicism and the country's high birth rate. She was utterly unpredictable in the positions she took. 'People find it difficult even in Ireland to categorise her,' Brady says. In the witty essay in which she came out against the anti-fur lobby, she recalled being pushed against a doorway and wordlessly handed a pamphlet about cruelty to animals. She went on to reflect: 'This confrontation raised in an acute form my rights as opposed to a Korean rabbit's rights.' </p> <p>Today, O'Faolain refers dismissively to the 'fake objective' and 'authoritative' tone she had to adopt in order to write those commentaries. 'When I entered the world of op-ed journalism,' she declares, vividly overstating the case, as is her custom, 'that male world of \"on the one hand\" and \"on the other\", I became an honourary man.' What is certain is that Are You Somebody? shocked everyone in the matey, close-mouthed newspaper circles in which she was a member in good standing. Among other intimate revelations, it described O'Faolain's consuming dedication to a proposition she had been taught to accept as self-evident: 'I'd spent my whole adult life on the errand that smoothed the way to being a woman in the home - a search for a man, for love, for the one man to love and be loved by and have babies with - without wanting to be a woman in the home.'</p> <p>Her quest turned up such intellectuals as the art critic Clement Greenberg (who once signed off a letter to her, 'in hopes of another orgasm'); the literary critic Leslie Fiedler (who took her on a visit to the film director John Huston, which the two of them cut short on account of the 'glacial meals' served in a dining room with ornate antique Chinese wallpaper), and the Irish novelist John McGahern (who, she wrote, 'was recovering from pain connected with the beautiful sister of a policeman'). She also discussed, albeit somewhat evasively, her almost 15-year involvement with a woman who is one of Ireland's most prominent feminist activists. When I ask O'Faolain, who was shipped off to a convent boarding school at the age of 14 because of her brazenly flirtatious ways - she was always climbing out the window to meet boys,' her sister Deirdre says - whether she considers herself to be a lesbian, she gives the subject short shrift. 'If I could find someone to love and be loved by,' she demands, 'do you think I would care about a minor detail like what gender the person is?' </p> <p>O'Faolain's cottage sits above Liscannor Bay, on a meandering little lane that ends at the shoreline. Three miles away, in the village of Lahinch, there are, as she puts it, 'a couple million pubs'. If you drive, as she does, with hair-raising lack of caution along winding two-way roads, it is an hour's trip from Shannon Airport to this underpopulated part of western Ireland. We pass a Wordsworthian landscape of stone walls, hawthorne hedges and fields where mud-covered cattle graze. 'Feisty little bullocks,' she mutters affectionately. 'They can take what God throws at them.' When she is not pointing out the sights, O'Faolain, who has a streaked mop of hair and striking grey eyes that have a slightly Oriental tilt to them, analyses the tragically flawed national temperament - 'disfigured by drink,' as she puts it, 'and a feeling of inner despair'. As we go by a majestic pink mansion that was once a children's hospital, she remarks in a tone of quiet bitterness, as though the potato blight that decimated Ireland's population had occurred yesterday, 'Sixty children died of cholera in that house.' </p> <p>The famously depressive Irish weather is nowhere in evidence when we pull up at her house; the sun glows perceptibly in a pale blue sky. O'Faolain unlocks the bright-red front door of her cottage, and we have barely stepped over the threshold when Molly, her beloved collie, dashes out, barking and wagging her tail in a frenzy of welcome. Inside, the house is decorated in an Arts-and-Craftsy style; there are whimsically patterned curtains on the windows, yellow walls and a colourfully tiled fireplace. Beyond the tiny kitchen, outfitted only with an ancient four-burner range and some unfinished shelves that hold a tin or two of sardines and several jars of jam and relish, an open laptop takes pride of place on the living-room table. But O'Faolain is eager to show me her pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance - a new bathroom with a shower that she had installed last year. She leads me to it, practically crowing with pleasure, and the two of us stare at it with a reverence usually reserved for great works of art. </p> <p>O'Faolain was the second-eldest of nine children who grew up in rural County Dublin in a family that looked richly cultured - 'My mother read all the time,' she recalls in her memoir, 'and my father taught us the words of German songs, and we played extracts from Swan Lake on the gramophone' - but was neglectful and impoverished. Her father was a celebrity, a debonair society columnist with a car and driver. But he was also an inveterate philanderer who was rarely home, treated his desperately smitten wife like a dependent child, pummeled his sons and kept his family in a humiliatingly penurious state.</p> <p>Her mother - whom O'Faolain refers to as 'Mammy' - was undomestic and unmaternal and retreated into the solace of novels and alcohol. Gestures of affection were rare ('I can't remember my mother ever picking one of us up of her own accord,' she says), and over the years the household became ever more dilapidated, and the younger siblings were increasingly left to fend for themselves. One of her little sisters once went to school without knickers on; another languished at home with untreated TB for more than a year, until a family friend noticed and took her to the sanitarium. </p> <p>O'Faolain talks with a kind of detached sorrow about her siblings, some of whom she doesn't speak to any more. She is closest to her sister Deirdre, a mother of seven who lives with her husband in a cramped terraced house without central heating in working-class Dublin. She describes the chronic emotional struggles of two other sisters but seems most saddened by the plight of her brother Don, who wasted his 'brilliant potential' in a futile search for their father's approval and systematically drank himself to death when he was in his early forties. </p> <p>On the surface, O'Faolain was the one who got away, triumphing over the circumstances of her background on the strength of her charm and wits. Her close friend Marian Finucane, who is the host of Ireland's most popular morning radio show and has known O'Faolain for 20 years, credits her great 'survival skills'. Finucane and I talk over an elegant lunch in a restaurant across from St Stephen's Green, in a building that was part of University College Dublin in the days when James Joyce was a student, and on the top floor of which the poet Gerard Manley Hopkins expired. 'When we were all stamped out of the same cloth,' Finucane explains, 'Nuala O'Faolain was different. She took the bravest route all the time.' From the start, O'Faolain shone academically, winning scholarships to University College and then to Oxford. In her thirties, after teaching briefly in the English department at UCD, she became a TV producer for the BBC, filming innovative shows on volatile subjects - religious sects, antipornography, transsexuals. </p> <p>But although O'Faolain had succeeded in moving forward by never looking homeward, her achievements never assuaged the bleakness she carried with her. With her trademark bluntness, she describes her thirties as 'a wasteland of misery and loss and mourning and drinking'. She spent much of this period, which culminated in a psychiatric hospitalisation in the wake of her father's death, as an emotional 'derelict', boozing away her demons in a Dublin basement flat. In spite of the early recognition she received for her intellectual abilities, O'Faolain considers herself to be 'a very late starter' when it comes to life skills. She learned to drive when she was 40 (she failed the test three times, and her instructor was on Valium, 'presumably,' she says, 'because of women like me'); took her first swimming lesson when she was 50, and promised herself that she'd learn to use a computer and get a dog by the time she was 55. While other women bemoan their lost youth, she considers her fifties to be her prime. 'I went into the phone booth and came out Lois Lane. It was the first time I lifted my head above the storm and dust that obscured everything. Until then, I had just gone from one day to the next.' </p> <p>These days, O'Faolain is a bona-fide celebrity and a powerful presence on the Irish literary scene. She divides her time between the country, her flat in Dublin and, increasingly, months-long intervals in Manhattan. As I stroll with her along busy Grafton Street one afternoon, we bump into several people she knows, including a dashingly dressed man whom she introduces as the city's 'best hairdresser and a great gossip'. </p> <p>Within the past year, O'Faolain has moved on to writing a more personal column, 'Regarding Ireland', on whatever catches her fancy for the Saturday magazine supplement to the Irish Times. A recent column was inspired by a new set of capped teeth she acquired in New York, which feat of dentistry led her to meditate upon differences in national character seen through the prism of attitudes toward self-improvement. She pokes wry fun at the Irish for their 'fidelity to natural decay' and goes on to upbraid them for their persistent, religiously instilled allegiance to the Last Day instead of the present one: 'You're supposed to assert your gritty authenticity,' she observes, 'by a display of yellowing, crooked, brownish bits and pieces of teeth that have the amazing merit of being untouched by the 20th century.' </p> <p>On my last morning in Dublin, O'Faolain uses some of her newly acquired clout to get a dusty employee of the National Library of Ireland to give us an advance peek at the Joyce manuscript recently purchased for \u00a31m at Christie's. She stares with shining eyes at the precious pages of carefully annotated prose from the 'Circe' section of Ulysses; they are preserved between plastic sheets and covered with Joyce's small, slanty script. 'This is the greatest moment of my life,' O'Faolain says. </p> <p>Shortly thereafter, we say goodbye in front of my hotel, where she has locked her bicycle to the railing. As I stand there, watching as she rides off to a TV interview, her back ramrod straight, her red interview jacket neatly folded in the basket, I'm suddenly reminded of my first sight of her several days earlier. She came rushing toward me in the early-morning gloom of Shannon Airport, an hour late to fetch me, calling my name wildly and apologising in the same breath. Dressed with youthful stylishness in leggings and a pink-cashmere scarf flung over a black plush jacket, she stood out among the weary-looking locals like a vivid apparition. </p> <p>O'Faolain has come far on her cleverness, her ambition, her insistence on being heard. It's odd, then, that given all this hurtling life force, this hard-won happiness, my strongest impression of O'Faolain is that she is running backward - toward the defeated mother of her childhood and toward the Ireland of the past, a desolate country of broken men and broken women. In one of her Times columns she described pubs, with the trembling sense of awe most people feel for holy wells and churches, as 'numinous spaces'. Although she assures me that she gets drunk these days only 'from exuberance', when she envisions her future, she sees herself as a shapeless old woman in a tweed coat held together with string, 10 empty beer bottles at her side. 'I can't wait to be an old lady,' she says. 'I'm dying to wither up so I can stop hurting.' And then she adds, almost dreamily: 'I'm going to live in a pub as soon as I get the old-age pension. Old ladies are always treated with great respect in pubs.' </p> <p>\u0095 My Dream of You (\u00a312.99, Michael Joseph) is published April 12.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Nuala O'Faolain is making up for lost time. It has been a meteoric five years since the 60-year-old journalist banged out her tentatively titled memoir, Are You Somebody?, in an inspired two months spent sitting at a wooden table in her one-bedroom cottage in County Clare. The book, which had an initial print run of 1,500 copies, remained on the Irish bestseller list for six months before it was bought for a pittance, presumably without great expectations, and became a bestseller around the world as well. O'Faolain's first novel, My Dream of You, comes out this week in Britain, and hopes are that it will be one of those rare crossover books that has both literary ambitions and wide commercial appeal. The novel is narrated by Kathleen, a middle-aged writer who is fiercely independent but lovelorn - a character who sounds very much like the author - and whose 'misunderstanding of passion' has led her on a lifelong search for a man who will provide both loving companionship and sexual bliss. The slightly meandering plot follows Kathleen to the remote village of Ballygall, where she has gone to research an obscure historical scandal known as the Talbot Judgment - involving a liaison between an Irish groom and an upper-class Anglo-Irish wife - which took place during the Great Famine of the 1840s. As the story navigates between Kathleen's own sense of romantic dislocation and the tightly constructed historical subplot, it speaks in naked and direct ways to women who are no longer young and firm-fleshed but who still keep 'a vigil outside the shrine of Eros'. After an unexpected one-night stand with a man she meets on a ferry, Kathleen broods: 'What if I never have another lover? What if I have to go the whole way to the grave without ever making love again?' Had the author not given a remarkably unzipped account of her own life and loves when she appeared on Ireland's top-rated chat show to promote her memoir, Are You Somebody? might never have become a literary sensation. The interview began on a startling note, with the host, Gay Byrne, nosily asking, 'You've slept with a lot of men, haven't you?' To which O'Faolain shot back: 'Only three that ever mattered, which is modest for a woman of my age.' The conversation steamed along from there, delving into the sort of damaging family history that most of Ireland's 'fretful, conscious citizenry', as O'Faolain once described it, didn't talk about but longed to hear discussed. She recalls that she appeared on the show in 'a rictus of terror', having prepared for it by giving up drinking and taking up exercising four weeks earlier, as well as praying to 'a God I didn't believe in'. Once on camera, she quickly charmed her way into the studio audience's hearts - 'I could feel them on my side,' she says - and within no time, Are You Somebody? was being sold straight from boxes before it even reached the shelves. The use of the word 'accidental' in the memoir's subtitle, The Accidental Memoir of a Dublin Woman, was not just a clever marketing ploy to catch the reader's attention. The book was, in fact, originally conceived of as no more than a grace note, an introduction to a collection of O'Faolain's widely read pieces from the Irish Times. 'I was ashamed,' she says, 'of reprinting columns with ancient arguments in them. It's the most pitiful form of bookmaking.' Once she decided to write an introduction, she explains, 'I had to answer the question nobody had asked: where do my opinions come from? The answer was simple: ideology had nothing to do with it. My opinions come from my life.' Despite her fears about writing in a private voice - 'You don't get to be an Irish woman of my age and say \"I, I, I\" with any confidence, because \"I\" has been frightened out of you' - the introduction swelled to 200 intensely personal pages. 'I sneaked out my autobiography when no one was looking,' she says, sounding like a child caught reading by torch under the sheets. 'My unconscious recognised a chance.' O'Faolain made her name for more than a decade as a maverick pundit at the Irish Times, where she expressed her often discomforting views about 'this damp little shambles of a democracy on the edge of the Western world'. The editor of the paper, Conor Brady, who offered O'Faolain her own column on a hunch after hearing her interviewed on the radio about her work as a producer of a magazine-style television series called Women Talking, was struck by her ability to 'infuse ordinary people's everyday activities with value and interest'. (O'Faolain prefers to shape her story - somewhat disingenuously - with a dramatic Cinderella twist, in which Brady plays the Prince Charming character; to hear her tell it, she was a middle-aged washout when he offered her the job out of the blue.) Within weeks of hiring her, Brady's instinct proved right. 'She just took off,' he recalls. 'She'd get these amazing mailbags from people because she touched something very elemental in their lives.' Her public voice was politicised without being doctrinaire; she could be as ardently outspoken as Germaine Greer, but her perspective was softened by bursts of humour and the Irish gift for lyrical lament that is so evident in the fiction of Edna O'Brien. (In a column called 'Birth', O'Faolain described the quiet, vigilant atmosphere of an intensive-care maternity ward in which 'you hear the silence of the babies. You long for them to cry, but they can't cry, because they are sedated. Tiny little starfish things, literal scraps of life.') With clear-eyed affection, O'Faolain registered the hidebound habits of mind - 'the florid national inefficiency' - she saw around her. 'She has a great capacity,' Brady observes, 'to force us to confront some of the illusions we like to have about ourselves in Ireland - that this is, for instance, a very good society in which to bring up children.' O'Faolain commented on the political issues of the day as well as on the ongoing vicissitudes such as domestic violence, Irish homophobia, the iron grip of Catholicism and the country's high birth rate. She was utterly unpredictable in the positions she took. 'People find it difficult even in Ireland to categorise her,' Brady says. In the witty essay in which she came out against the anti-fur lobby, she recalled being pushed against a doorway and wordlessly handed a pamphlet about cruelty to animals. She went on to reflect: 'This confrontation raised in an acute form my rights as opposed to a Korean rabbit's rights.' Today, O'Faolain refers dismissively to the 'fake objective' and 'authoritative' tone she had to adopt in order to write those commentaries. 'When I entered the world of op-ed journalism,' she declares, vividly overstating the case, as is her custom, 'that male world of \"on the one hand\" and \"on the other\", I became an honourary man.' What is certain is that Are You Somebody? shocked everyone in the matey, close-mouthed newspaper circles in which she was a member in good standing. Among other intimate revelations, it described O'Faolain's consuming dedication to a proposition she had been taught to accept as self-evident: 'I'd spent my whole adult life on the errand that smoothed the way to being a woman in the home - a search for a man, for love, for the one man to love and be loved by and have babies with - without wanting to be a woman in the home.' Her quest turned up such intellectuals as the art critic Clement Greenberg (who once signed off a letter to her, 'in hopes of another orgasm'); the literary critic Leslie Fiedler (who took her on a visit to the film director John Huston, which the two of them cut short on account of the 'glacial meals' served in a dining room with ornate antique Chinese wallpaper), and the Irish novelist John McGahern (who, she wrote, 'was recovering from pain connected with the beautiful sister of a policeman').

An investigation into the Jedwabne horror led to the acquittal of 10 defendants, to the release of another dozen well before the end of their sentences and to the reprieve of the one and only accused actually sentenced to death.

The second is one of horror that Irving's poison and lies were accepted as respectable history for so long. </p> <p>The first is best expressed by Richard Rampton, the barrister for the US academic Deborah Lipstadt, the subject of the action, whose book, Denying the Holocaust, accused Irving of being 'one of the most dangerous spokespersons for Holocaust denial'. The eyewitness and documentary evidence, he suggests, is so overwhelming that 'some other reason must be sought to explain [Irving's] devotion over many years... to the bizarre idea that no significant numbers of people were murdered in the homicidal gas chambers at Auschwitz-Birkenau'. </p> <p>That devotion can be explained in part by Irving's anti-Semitism and in part by his deep consciousness of being an outsider from the mainstream of academic thought. But it must also be attributed to the very fact that his ideas had never been successfully challenged, either by historians or, to their shame, by his fellow Britons, despite their avowed racial tolerance. </p> <p>The most sobering part of the book is a short passage where Guttenplan elaborates this country's history of anti-Semitism. The 'blood-libel' (that Jews drank the blood of Christian children to celebrate Passover) was first recorded in Norwich in 1144. England was the first European country to expel the Jews (in 1290) and they did not return, except as illegal immigrants, until Cromwell allowed them back three and a half centuries later. No Jew sat as an MP until halfway through the nineteenth century. Matthew Arnold campaigned against removing restrictions on Jewish entry to Oxford and Cambridge, saying: 'England is the land of Englishmen, not Jews.' </p> <p>The questions raised by the Irving trial (What drove Irving on? How did he get away with it for so long? Why was he taken seriously? Why does Holocaust denial continue to resonate?) all have the same chilling answer: anti-Semitism. This may appear simplistic, but through all the noise and confusion, it is the only possible conclusion to draw. </p> <p>Guttenplan's final chapter is a call for solidarity among his fellow Jews in the fight against prejudice. In Britain, he suggests this might mean Jewish leaders speaking out more against police brutality and the treatment of asylum-seekers. 'What does it say when the two recent Home Secretaries - one Conservative, one Labour - who have done more to restrict the rights of refugees are themselves respectively the son and grandson of Jewish refugees?'

Her stories of family turmoil, of traumas dwelt upon, have led her to be defined, as the publisher's blurb on this massive biography by Michael King does, as a writer-cum-self-help-guru, a woman who 'climbed out of an abyss of unhappiness to take control of her life'. </p> <p>Born in New Zealand in 1924, to a family fallen from relative prosperity to ramshackle impecuniousness, she spent her twenties in mental asylums in New Zealand and London, diagnosed as schizophrenic. Her novels, which include Owls do Cry (1957), Faces in the Water (1961) Scented Gardens for the Blind (1963) and Intensive Care (1970), are relentless sagas of distress. The Frame sisters - Janet, June, Myrtle and Laura - felt themselves to be like the Bront\u00ebs - because they held, by right, 'silk purses' of words, and because their family was an anvil on which disasters fell. </p> <p>They grew up in cramped rooms in Dunedin; their father a train driver, their mother a housewife and poet. With brother Geordie - doomed by their Bront\u00eb myth to Branwellesque decline - they muddied their faces and blotted the neighbourhood with shrieked obscenities. Geordie became an epileptic and, eventually, a wife-smashing alcoholic; Myrtle and Laura died in strange swimming accidents. These events, King suggests, precipitated Frame's mental collapse, and formed much of the matter of her work, in transmuted form. </p> <p>Just how specifically Frame alludes to family disasters in her disaster-strewn fiction is never resolved in King's elegantly written, densely researched and remorselessly long biography. Frame, while avowing the fictiveness of her accounts of lunacy, also presented her concerns as inward-turning: 'I'm not sure that I see life at all. What I do see is life within.' Faces in the Water she described as 'simply an almost truthful account of a few past experiences'. The first work she referred to explicitly as a novel, The Edge of the Alphabet, was, King writes, 'based on the troubled experience of Geordie'. However, she later suggested that her autobiography, An Angel at my Table, was partly written to convince everyone that, after all 'my fiction is genuine fiction. And I do invent things'.</p> <p>Frame's definition of autobiography as 'fact', versus fiction as 'invented', is a definition King respects, yet it does not hold the reader. Frame's world beyond this world, her moment of creative rapture, appears to be a point of trance-like introspection. </p> <p>Yet personal allusions are rendered obscure in Frame's fiction by an intensely metaphorical style. Analogies are laden on to analogies, developing into riots of hyper-meaning. Houses rock 'like a sea', blame rests on individuals 'like a butterfly on a leaf'. One metaphor twirls the paragraph away, into the skewed world of its particular nature, and then is hotly pursued by another, demanding another reality twist. Mental turmoil is described as a 'big brown bird, like a hawk... flying down to pick out my insides, as if I were a sheep or a rabbit and count the jewels in me, to prove everything'. Characters converse with nightmarish apparitions called Uncle Blackbeetle; readers find themselves told at the end of a novel that the narrative has been the deranged fantasy of an incarcerated mute. </p> <p>In his respectful account, King argues that Frame's strangeness of perception was misdiagnosed as schizophrenia. Her doctors, intercepting letters in which she described gorse smelling like peanut butter, discerned not the artist 'making it new', but the 'disordered mind' confusing a spiky bush with an edible nutty paste. Other psychiatrists, more literary of bent, diagnosed her as a schizophrenic in the manner of 'Van Gogh, of Hugo Wolf'. </p> <p>Frame was not entirely displeased by these sorts of doctors' notes: 'Great artists, visionaries... My place was set then, at the terrible feast... at least I could endow my work and... life with the mark of my schizophrenia.' What King doesn't suggest, but what haunts the reader, is that Frame's acute depression may have been misdiagnosed as genius. A gulf seems to develop between the hyperbole of eulogies rained upon Frame and her writing. King suggests she was somehow divinely inspired.</p> <p>From the publication of her first book, The Lagoon and Other Stories (1951), Frame was showered with prizes and plaudits from a commendably generous New Zealand literary establishment. She was sent round the world to expand her mind; later, she was given a deposit for a house. She was feted by the grand old man of New Zealand letters, Frank Sargeson, who became a housewife to her for a year, and gave her a hut to write in. She was put forward for the Nobel Prize; she was compared to Katherine Mansfield and Virginia Woolf. After the plaudits, Frame's poetry disappoints, striking the reader as fridge-magnet disarrangements of words. </p> <p>Tales of her onomatopoeic word poems about the Holocaust send anticipatory spasms of horror across the solar plexus. Her bons mots fail to delight - her thoughtful definition of 'surrealism' as something 'beyond the real' seems wretchedly sloppy, her analysis of her work draped in lode-star New Ageries: 'I felt those reading it to be within this whirlpool; the whole world with everything broken by the gravity star. Everything was to be renewed - rebuilt, selves, thought, language, everything.' </p> <p>Such is the meticulousness of King's book that Frame is overexposed. The lustre of genius dims as we read about her driving lessons, fluctuating house prices in Dunedin, her tax returns. Patrick White, writer and Nobel Laureate, wrote Frame a fan letter but refused to meet her, fearing his vision of her as extraordinary would be 'collapsed if she'd crossed the threshold and sat down to tea. He didn't want her to be ordinary... so he fobbed her off'. In King's account, our extended tea party with Frame draws her out as something of an authorial Our Man in Havana, abducted into a plot so wild and extraordinary it constantly resembled fiction.</p>",

Frame, while avowing the fictiveness of her accounts of lunacy, also presented her concerns as inward-turning: 'I'm not sure that I see life at all. What I do see is life within.' Faces in the Water she described as 'simply an almost truthful account of a few past experiences'. The first work she referred to explicitly as a novel, The Edge of the Alphabet, was, King writes, 'based on the troubled experience of Geordie'. However, she later suggested that her autobiography, An Angel at my Table, was partly written to convince everyone that, after all 'my fiction is genuine fiction. And I do invent things'. Frame's definition of autobiography as 'fact', versus fiction as 'invented', is a definition King respects, yet it does not hold the reader. Frame's world beyond this world, her moment of creative rapture, appears to be a point of trance-like introspection. Yet personal allusions are rendered obscure in Frame's fiction by an intensely metaphorical style. Analogies are laden on to analogies, developing into riots of hyper-meaning. Houses rock 'like a sea', blame rests on individuals 'like a butterfly on a leaf'. One metaphor twirls the paragraph away, into the skewed world of its particular nature, and then is hotly pursued by another, demanding another reality twist. Mental turmoil is described as a 'big brown bird, like a hawk... flying down to pick out my insides, as if I were a sheep or a rabbit and count the jewels in me, to prove everything'. Characters converse with nightmarish apparitions called Uncle Blackbeetle; readers find themselves told at the end of a novel that the narrative has been the deranged fantasy of an incarcerated mute. In his respectful account, King argues that Frame's strangeness of perception was misdiagnosed as schizophrenia. Her doctors, intercepting letters in which she described gorse smelling like peanut butter, discerned not the artist 'making it new', but the 'disordered mind' confusing a spiky bush with an edible nutty paste. Other psychiatrists, more literary of bent, diagnosed her as a schizophrenic in the manner of 'Van Gogh, of Hugo Wolf'. Frame was not entirely displeased by these sorts of doctors' notes: 'Great artists, visionaries... My place was set then, at the terrible feast... at least I could endow my work and... life with the mark of my schizophrenia.' What King doesn't suggest, but what haunts the reader, is that Frame's acute depression may have been misdiagnosed as genius. A gulf seems to develop between the hyperbole of eulogies rained upon Frame and her writing. King suggests she was somehow divinely inspired. From the publication of her first book, The Lagoon and Other Stories (1951), Frame was showered with prizes and plaudits from a commendably generous New Zealand literary establishment. She was sent round the world to expand her mind; later, she was given a deposit for a house. She was feted by the grand old man of New Zealand letters, Frank Sargeson, who became a housewife to her for a year, and gave her a hut to write in. She was put forward for the Nobel Prize; she was compared to Katherine Mansfield and Virginia Woolf. After the plaudits, Frame's poetry disappoints, striking the reader as fridge-magnet disarrangements of words. Tales of her onomatopoeic word poems about the Holocaust send anticipatory spasms of horror across the solar plexus. Her bons mots fail to delight - her thoughtful definition of 'surrealism' as something 'beyond the real' seems wretchedly sloppy, her analysis of her work draped in lode-star New Ageries: 'I felt those reading it to be within this whirlpool; the whole world with everything broken by the gravity star. Everything was to be renewed - rebuilt, selves, thought, language, everything.' Such is the meticulousness of King's book that Frame is overexposed. The lustre of genius dims as we read about her driving lessons, fluctuating house prices in Dunedin, her tax returns. Patrick White, writer and Nobel Laureate, wrote Frame a fan letter but refused to meet her, fearing his vision of her as extraordinary would be 'collapsed if she'd crossed the threshold and sat down to tea. He didn't want her to be ordinary... so he fobbed her off'. In King's account, our extended tea party with Frame draws her out as something of an authorial Our Man in Havana, abducted into a plot so wild and extraordinary it constantly resembled fiction.",

Last week the man on whom it was loosely modelled spoke about it for the first time, telling The Observer a very different story. Amos Pampaloni is 90 now, living with his wife Marisa in Florence. De Berni\u00e8res has always insisted his hero was a composite figure. His mandolin was an invention arising from his own mastery of the instrument. But, like the hero of the book, Pampaloni was a captain in the 33rd artillery regiment of the Acqui division, sent by Mussolini to occupy Cephalonia. Like Antonio Corelli, Pampaloni fell in love with a Cephalonian girl, participated in the first military action against the Germans after the Italian armistice, and miraculously survived an attempted execution. The book describes a love affair that gradually blossoms in an atmosphere of suspicion and hostility between a Cephalonian girl and the unwelcome Italian officer who is billeted in her home, forcing her to give up her bed. Pampaloni said last week: 'My true love story was very simple. It was a platonic relationship with a young girl aged 18, while I was then 33.' He recalled: 'She was the daughter of a Greek gentleman I knew, who used to invite me to lunch.

The Italian soldier doesn't know how to play the conqueror, as the English did. He would share his bread with the local children.' Pampoloni's path towards artistic immortality began in the early 1960s, when he published a brief memoir of his experiences in Cephalonia in the magazine Il Ponte. The article aroused the interest of the historian and novelist Marcello Venturi, who interviewed the former captain and travelled to Cephalonia to research the tragedy of Italy's 11,500-strong occupation force, all but exterminated by the Germans in September 1943. Venturi's novel, White Flag at Cephalonia, was translated into English in 1966 and is acknowledged as a source by de Berni\u00e8res.

The Rosenbach Collection in Philadelphia announced that it could now open some long-sealed letters that were certain to shed light on the life of one of cinema's most silent legends. </p> <p>Mercedes de Acosta was a socialite and writer; she was marginal to the public view of Hollywood's firmament, but central to the private lives of some of its stars. She was reputed to have slept with so many people that when Truman Capote invented a game called International Daisy Chain, the aim of which was to link people sexually in as few moves as possible, he said Mercedes de Acosta was the best card you could have. </p> <p>De Acosta deposited her private papers at the Rosenbach Collection in 1960 on one condition: that her letters from Garbo (some 87 missives in total) not be made public until 10 years after the last of the two women died. De Acosta died in 1968. Garbo died on 15 April 1990. One might reasonably assume that The Girls, an account of lesbian relationships in Hollywood from the 1910s to the 1950s, was the first response to these new revelations. </p> <p>However, it seems that non-scholars will have to wait a little longer to find out the contents of those letters; though the Garbo-de Acosta affair is central to McLellan's book, she has looked at all of de Acosta's papers but these, and it's hard to understand why she couldn't wait for them to be made public. </p> <p>It has long been known that Garbo and her counterpart, Marlene Dietrich, slept with women, that they had what Garbo called 'hidden lives' and 'exciting secrets'. It lent an added sexual charge to their on-screen appeal; both Dietrich's unangelic nightclub singer in The Blue Angel, the film that made her famous, and Garbo's cross-dressing Queen Christina had an ambiguous, androgynous air. Off-screen, rumours of their homosexuality, though damaging under the Hays Code of the 1920s, contributed to the mystery of these aloof, heavily accented, trouser-clad stars. And, more prosaically, it made them signs of their times. </p> <p>In the decadent world of early twentieth-century glamour, lesbian affairs were very much in fashion. Whether it was among the writers and artists of Paris's Left Bank (Colette, Djuna Barnes, Gertrude Stein, Marie Laurencin), amid the theatrical heroines of Broadway (Eleonora Duse, Alla Nazimova, Katherine Cornell) or the stars of the silver screen (Tallulah Bankhead, Louise Brooks, Joan Crawford, Barbara Stanwyck), affairs were ongoing, whichever way you looked. </p> <p>McLellan cites a survey of 2,200 mostly middle-class women taken in the 1920s: more than half of them said they had experienced 'intense emotional relationships with women' and half again specified that sex was involved. It was just a trend, so common it yielded a great apocryphal joke. When a dazzled young man approached one of these actresses and said: 'I must have you for my wife!', her reported reply was: 'Oh really? When can I meet her?' </p> <p>As McLellan puts it: 'Most of NY's smart young things did not expect to stay Sapphic for life.' They got married eventually, and, if they were not just tourists after all, they made sure they found themselves a 'lavender husband' who would put up with a platonic marriage. But since everyone slept with everyone (or at least Bankhead and de Acosta did), the accounts McLellan gives feel rather dull and dizzying after a while. The map is drawn clearly enough, but that's all it is - a map of the underground. </p> <p>There are two main things McLellan claims are new here. One is that Garbo and Dietrich once had a passionate affair that left Garbo so bruised they both pretended all their lives they'd never met. The other is that Dietrich had been secretly married in her youth, to a communist who later set up the Anti-Nazi League in Los Angeles, leading directly to the Hollywood 10 trials. </p> <p>It would be wonderful if these stories were true, but McLellan is not convincing. The Garbo-Dietrich affair is concluded from the fact that the two actresses appeared in a movie together before they arrived in Hollywood - GW Pabst's Joyless Street. This is true, and it's true that Dietrich's name is not on the credits; she only admitted later on that she was in the film. McLellan is not wrong to wonder at the secrecy of all this, but from there to assuming a full-scale affair is quite a leap. </p> <p>She supports her argument with the fact that, for a few nanoseconds in the movie, Garbo is required to faint into Dietrich's arms. This, says McLellan, is an indication of deep trust. Others might recognise it as a form of behaviour called acting. (You start to worry about McLellan's sanity when she pictures Dietrich 'nurturing [Garbo] with her delicious homemade goulash'.) </p> <p>McLellan's investigations into the life of Otto Katz, Dietrich's supposed first husband, are substantial, and he is a fascinating character. She has read Dietrich's FBI file (it is unsurprising that they had one on her), but no one ever doubted that these two people existed. It's the link between them that's the problem and no amount of archival evidence from each side can blur the fact that the link is weak. </p> <p>Katz bragged to two, possibly three, people that he had once had a liaison with Dietrich before she was famous. He once challenged someone to go and look up the marriage records in Teplitz, Czechoslovakia, for proof that they actually wed, but these, McLellan finds, were destroyed by the Nazis. Regardless of whether Dietrich and Katz knew each other in Hollywood, it remains impossible to say whether they were ever married early in life. </p> <p>As she tells us in her introduction, McLellan spent 10 years working as a gossip columnist in Washington and that is the tone she adopts here. The book is divided into short, digestible sections headed with a quote, like the paragraphs of a tabloid newspaper. In the manner of the worst biographers, a conditional tense is used to guess at events that the writer couldn't possibly know about. Salka Viertel, a mutual friend of Garbo and Dietrich and a key character in McLellan's tale, is imagined plotting to keep Garbo to herself; words are even put into her mouth: 'Don't worry, darling, Salka would have cooed.' </p> <p>McLellan appears to have fallen victim to some sort of biographer's tic; whenever there is no evidence for something, she uses the word 'evidently' in her account of it. 'Salka was evidently au fait with the Garbo-Dietrich liaison'; 'Salka had evidently taken Marlene to her bosom and elsewhere'; 'Marlene evidently confided her worries [about her secret husband] to Mercedes', and so on. If you look these passages up in the notes, they are totally uncorroborated. </p> <p>It seems strange that someone who has taken the trouble to look at manuscripts and dig out old FBI files should resort to a narrative that is purely speculative at every critical turn.</p>",

      "body": "<p>British cinema appears to range quite widely over the social spectrum taking in the plight of refugees, the antics of lovable cockney gangsters, the consciences of IRA gunmen, the ingenious schemes of unemployed northerners, the artistic ambition of miners' sons, the romantic problems of well-heeled, unmarried thirtysomethings. What our movies rarely touch on, and never in any depth, are the anxieties and aspirations of the professional middle classes, who are invariably viewed as comic or parasitic, patronised the way the working classes once were. </p> <p>For this reason, Edward Yang's expansive film about an affluent, seemingly contented middle-class family in Taiwan, A One and a Two, will provide a welcome shock of recognition for many British moviegoers. Born in Shanghai in 1947, Yang was brought to what was then Formosa in 1949 and, like the hero of his new film, studied engineering before spending a decade in graduate school and working as systems designer in the States.

      "bodyText": "British cinema appears to range quite widely over the social spectrum taking in the plight of refugees, the antics of lovable cockney gangsters, the consciences of IRA gunmen, the ingenious schemes of unemployed northerners, the artistic ambition of miners' sons, the romantic problems of well-heeled, unmarried thirtysomethings. What our movies rarely touch on, and never in any depth, are the anxieties and aspirations of the professional middle classes, who are invariably viewed as comic or parasitic, patronised the way the working classes once were. For this reason, Edward Yang's expansive film about an affluent, seemingly contented middle-class family in Taiwan, A One and a Two, will provide a welcome shock of recognition for many British moviegoers. Born in Shanghai in 1947, Yang was brought to what was then Formosa in 1949 and, like the hero of his new film, studied engineering before spending a decade in graduate school and working as systems designer in the States. He began filmmaking 20 years ago in Taiwan and has made six features, all elaborate social mosaics of life in Taiwan such as Taipei Story and the four-hour A Brighter Summer Day, ambitious, taxing movies in which I found more to respect than to enjoy. His new film is his best, most accessible to date and it deserves to find as large an audience in Britain as did his compatriot Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. The film's original title is Yi Yi, which literally means 'one-one' or 'individually' in Chinese.

N.J.'s wife, Ming Ming, falls into a depression that leads to her going into a Buddhist retreat, though the family no longer have any formal religious practice. In fact, a spiritual void in their lives is one of their troubles. Meanwhile, N.J. faces a severe crisis in the electronics business where he is a partner.

      "body": "<p>Think of a recent hit British film. Odds are, the film you have just thought of was made by Working Title. Four Weddings, Elizabeth, Bean, Notting Hill: all Working Title. This spring's Bridget Jones' Diary and Captain Corelli's Mandolin? Working Title. And when Working Title set up a division (WT2) to make low budget movies, the result was Billy Elliot. </p> <p>That's not the whole story, though. Because if all those Hugh Grant foppish romantic comedies leave you cold, it is worth knowing that Working Title has been home to the Coen brothers since The Hudsucker Proxy . Worried about the politics of Captain Corelli's Mandolin? Working Title was also behind left-wing satire Bob Roberts and co-chairman Eric Fellner produced Ken Loach's Hidden Agenda. </p> <p>Stephen Frears, who directed Working Title's first feature (My Beautiful Laundrette), as well as the more recent High Fidelity, believes that Working Title co-chairmen Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner are the most powerful film producers ever to be based in London. 'There has never been anyone as successful as Tim and Eric. [Alexander] Korda can't have had that much power. Neither did Michael Balcon. David Puttnam certainly didn't. They're incredibly successful at making a certain kind of film.' </p> <p>Bigger than Sir Alexander Korda - Britain's own Hollywood-style \u00e9migr\u00e9 movie mogul of the Thirties and Forties? Bigger than Ealing supremo Michael Balcon? It's a hefty claim: Bevan is only 43 and Fellner 41. But the bare business facts back it up: their \u00a3389 million 1999 deal with Universal gives them permission to OK budgets up to \u00a315 million on their own. Notting Hill holds the international box office record for a British film. 'They have learnt to make films for export,' Frears adds, 'I think that is very clever of them, it's very smart, and new in my lifetime.' Bevan and Fellner are in the same business as smart, major studio connected ex-indies like Miramax. The only difference is that Working Title are based in London. </p> <p>'They are energetic, not naive, not arty-farty, or up their own arse: \"Let's make a film that will please six people in Hampstead or the Upper East Side of New York,\"' says their in-house star Hugh Grant. </p> <p>'I think that Eric was always interested in getting into the American end of it,' says director Alex Cox, who worked with Fellner on Sid And Nancy , 'So in that way everything worked out as he wanted. I think it is unfortunate because what you have is a great hands-on, personal producer who has become a financier. </p> <p>'And maybe that doesn't take enough advantage of his talents. I think he works best with someone who feels very strongly about what they are doing. That's why Hidden Agenda turned out to be such a strong film.' </p> <p>Perhaps it is significant that neither Bevan or Fellner went to university, or trained at the BBC. New Zealand-born Bevan is the flashier one - the one who was married to Joely Richardson, the one who features on Tatler 's list of 'dateable boys', the one listed simply as 'Handsome Man' in the credits of Elizabeth, the one reckoned to have the more commercial instincts. Fellner is the one who can smooth things out, softly talk people round, but also the one with the artier tendencies. But Billy Elliot director Stephen Daldry doesn't think that encapsulates their working methods. 'I've always worked with both of them together. There has never been one or the other of them that I felt more in tune with. The joy of them is that they strangely never contradict each other, and despite the fact that they are different personalities, they are in agreement. When you talk to one, you always feel you are talking to the other as well.' </p> <p>Both Bevan and Fellner started off producing pop videos in the early Eighties, when they were in their twenties. Along with Sarah Radclyffe (who left in 1990, and went on to produce The War Zone and Ratcatcher), Bevan founded Working Title in 1984, and its first film was My Beautiful Laundrette. Fellner, meanwhile, was producing Sid and Nancy. 'He just seemed like a very, on top of it, organised guy, who would be a good producer,' remembers director Alex Cox, 'He turned out to be a fantastic producer. We had a relatively small budget, but it was really Eric who managed to turn a comparatively small budget into an 11-week schedule. I'm still not sure how he did it. His skills as an on-the-floor producer were absolutely tremendous. It's the ability to manage money and make it go a long way, which was far more important in those days than it would be now, because he is dealing with such large sums of money. When we were making Sid and Nancy, or when he made Hidden Agenda, all the money is on the screen.' </p> <p>Fellner joined Working Title in 1992. By that time, though, Bevan had the film that would set the formula for Working Title's biggest successes. No one who saw it in 1989 thought that The Tall Guy was the future of British cinema, but in many ways, it was. A romantic comedy scripted by Richard Curtis, it paired posh British talent (Emma Thompson) with an imported American star (Jeff Goldblum), along with Rowan Atkinson running amok. When Working Title rejigged the same elements five years later to make Four Weddings and a Funeral, they moved from being big by British standards to serious players. </p> <p>A big part of the Working Title story is loyalty: the same names (Frears, Curtis, Grant, Atkinson) crop up again and again over the years. Equally important is Polygram, the company that (along with Film Four) kept British film alive in the Nineties. Think of the hits that weren't Working Title productions - Shallow Grave, Trainspotting, Lock Stock - (The Full Monty is the big exception) they all had some Polygram involvement. Working Title and Polygram were vital to each other. In fact, it was Polygram's Michael Kuhn who brought Bevan and Fellner together. When Universal bought and dismantled Polygram, the deal with Working Title was the one thing they kept. </p> <p>There is no easy answer to why Bevan and Fellner have succeeded where so many others have failed. 'They create a context in which people can flourish,' says Stephen Daldry, who was running the Royal Court and had no serious film making ambitions until Bevan and Fellner took him out for lunch, and told him he should make a film for them. The mantra is 'quality movies with commercial appeal,' and while you can debate the 'quality' vs 'commercial' balance, their films are never less than professional, never hurried, never shoddy. And for every time they play safe (Notting Hill) they take a chance (hiring controversial Indian director Shekhar Kapur to direct Elizabeth). Success is breeding success: they certainly seem to have a near monopoly on the adaptations of British best sellers: after Bridget Jones and Captain Corelli comes Nick Hornby's About A Boy, starring (you guessed it) Hugh Grant. </p> <p>But Captain Corelli will be interesting: at $45 million it is the most expensive Working Title film, and certainly the most contentious of the high profile ones. Some have hinted, though, that even here Bevan and Fellner have pre-empted their critics. Why? Because the person hired to adapt Louis de Berni\u00e8res's rabidly anti-communist book was Shawn Slovo, daughter of ANC/South African Communist Party hero, Joe Slovo. </p> <p>'I'm of the old-fashioned opinion that material rules,' is Bevan's theory of their success. 'And I think that 90 per cent of stars or high-end actors would generally agree with that.' The problem is that most of the stuff they read is crap and most of the stuff they do is crap. Maybe that is why the one constant in Working Title's biggest hits isn't a star or a director, it is writer Richard Curtis. </p> <p>What they do have is that supposedly un-British ability to make things happen. Alex Cox remembers when they were struggling to finish the micro-budgetted, Joe Strummer-starring spaghetti Western Straight To Hell. 'We were supposed to be making the film in three weeks, and it looked like we would run out of time and wouldn't have enough money to go into a fourth week, and so Eric got on an aeroplane, went to Los Angeles, and came back with a suitcase full of money to finish the film. I've never seen that before: there actually was a suitcase full of money. That's pretty miraculous.' Compared to that, getting on the phone to Julia Roberts must seem pretty simple. </p> <p><strong>Celluloid masters</strong></p> <p>1 <strong>Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner:</strong> Co-chairmen, Working Title.</p> <p>2 <strong>Paul Webster:</strong> Head of Film Four.

      "bodyText": "A government agency is investigating the first 'Category 1' water pollution incident connected to the foot-and-mouth crisis. Hundreds of fish have been killed in a fresh water course in Anglesey after disinfectant used during a cull of cattle leaked into a spring. The incident is the first evidence of the serious environmental damage experts believe the mass cull of cattle and sheep may create if it is not handled more carefully. An Environment Agency spokesman said that restrictions on movement around the country were hampering its investigations into the incident in which hundreds of trout and eel died. He said that there had also been a number of more minor pollution breaches which had been caused by blood and animal waste leaking into rivers. The Government was facing more criticism last night over the plans to bury tens of thousands of sheep and cattle after it was revealed that a similar policy in America had led to an environmental disaster. Up to a million chickens, pigs and cattle were buried in pits in North Carolina after Hurricane Floyd wreaked havoc in 1999. The policy has led to contamination of thousands of wells which the state relies on for its water supply. Levels of illnesses in the local population have also soared. 'If you do it wrong now you will be living with the consequences for the next 15 years,' said Elliott Moorhead, the chief executive of NanoVapor and one of America's leading experts in animal waste disposal. 'What you are basically building is a pit where diseases can breed. It is a potential disaster.' News of the pollution outbreak will damage the Prime Minister's attempts to re-invigorate Britain's tourism industry which has been hit hard by the foot-and-mouth crisis. A Downing Street official admitted that pictures of dead fish floating in rivers was not 'the kind of imagery that will sell well abroad'. Tony Blair is getting increasingly frustrated at the lack of action on opening up the countryside. County councils across the country said yesterday that they would refuse to open up footpaths and access to the countryside despite orders from Downing Street. 'There is no evidence that any case of infection has been caused by walkers, by visitors, or by people not in contact with livestock,' the Environment Minister, Beverley Grant, said yesterday. 'This means that local authorities and others ought to be basing their assessment of how far they can open up the countryside on that scientific evidence.' The first evidence that the burial programme was facing serious environmental problems came last week when Maff admitted that it would have to dig up the carcasses of almost 900 sheep and cattle because they had been disposed of in the wrong site. The carcasses had been buried a few metres away from a fresh water spring at Tow Law, Co Durham, despite orders from the Environment Agency that the area should not be used. Meanwhile, Agriculture Minister Nick Brown played down the role that a Chinese restaurant may have played in the foot-and-mouth outbreak. His department had previously highlighted illegal imports of meat from China as the most probably source of the disease, the reporting of which resulted in a 40 per cent fall in the takings of Chinese restaurants, many of which received racist phonecalls. However, in a meeting with delegates of the Chinese Civil Rights Action Group he said there was currently no evidence linking the outbreak with imported Chinese meat. In an official statement, he failed to rule out a Chinese restaurant as a possible source, but said: 'It would be totally unfair to make a scapegoat of the Chinese community or Chinese restaurants. The investigations into the source of the outbreak are still continuing, and ill-informed, groundless speculation does nothing to help the situation.

      "body": "<p>\"What should be done with Maff?\" cried Ian Willmore, media coordinator for Friends of the Earth. '\"What should be done with Maff? Maff should be shot in the head, dumped in a trench, fried to a cinder, sprinkled with quicklime and buried with a stake through its heart, that's what should be done with Maff ...and you can quote me on that if you want.\"</p> <p>In normal circumstances quotation would be all but pointless. Willmore would be a voice from the green fringe, which could be dismissed by those whose opinions matter with the killer condemnatory sentence: 'No one takes him seriously.' Not this time, I think. The foot and mouth epidemic has had the cheering effect of shifting the fringe to the mainstream.</p> <p>I've never found New Labour politicians and advisers as furious or as willing to talk to Leftie hacks. Undoubtedly the anger has been caused in part by the postponement of elections. But it is elevated by a less partisan contempt for the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and a determination that it should share the fate of millions of beasts. 'We've learned the hard way that the department which gave us BSE is the last organisation you want on your side in a crisis,' said one.</p> <p>The official line is that the fall in the daily count of new cases shows that the slaughter programme is 'beginning to bite'. No one wants to contradict guarded optimism in public. In private, however, many worry about spread rather than numbers. There may be fewer outbreaks but they are popping up all over the country - in Shropshire, Cornwall, and the Peak District. This does not look like an emergency which has been contained. Above all, the strength of the disease in Cumbria terrifies officials. \"I don't know if we can stop it sweeping across to the Humber, however many animals we slaughter,' said one member of the Downing Street crisis team. 'We may have to think about vaccination again.\"</p> <p>Opposition to vaccination is the ruling passion of the National Farmers' Union and Maff (the NFU's political wing). If their dogma is overturned both will be humiliated and Maff may die of shame and be replaced by a Ministry for Rural Affairs. Sticking to slaughter until the last cow dies in the last ditch suits their interests, but administrative convenience may not be enough to save Maff when New Labour's confrontation with the Ministry has been so disillusioning.</p> <p>The party came to power as modernisers. In agriculture, as in so much else, 'modernity' meant more of the same. A party adviser described Maff as a dumping ground for civil servants. The wages were lower, the chances of moving on to a better job in Whitehall non-existent. A posting to Maff was the bureaucratic equivalent of a Politburo order to take up duties at a Mongolian power station or - to mix continents, and quite possibly metaphors as well - to check in for an indefinite stay at the Hotel California. \"It was a secretive, depressed place,' he said, 'very suspicious of change, very defensive. New Ministers and new permanent secretaries can't stop the treacle layer of senior civil servants trapping new ideas.\"</p> <p>Jack Cunningham, the first Labour Agriculture Minister, at least tried to change the privileges granted to the NFU by the Tories. He also noticed that while his office was a 10 feet square coop without a desk, senior civil servants were housed in some splendour. Cunningham made a fuss and the stories about 'Junket Jack', which were to help finish his career, duly appeared. The Civil Service can be vicious when crossed. 'Expect articles about how Nick Brown failed to heed the sound advice of righteous officials to surface within days,' my new friend predicted.</p> <p>Back-covering briefers will have to work hard. The suicidally honest Michael Meacher blurted out last week that there will be an inquiry when the mess is finally cleared up and was reprimanded for telling the truth. When it comes, as it will, the investigators must ask: why a Maff inspector missed the initial outbreak? Why animal movements were allowed for four days after foot and mouth was discovered? When did Maff officials warn Ministers that trouble was coming? Why were misleading figures on detection and slaughter rates fed to Downing Street? How rigorous was Maff in cracking down on the 'black sheep' smuggling market of subsidy-fiddling farmers? And why was the conclusion that the Army and epidemiologists should be called in at once, which had been reached by the inquiries into the 1967-68 outbreak, ignored?</p> <p>The last question has provoked many accusations in the past few days. But exiles from Maff argue that it should be rephrased. 'Someone should look at all the contingency plans from '68 to the present day,' said one, 'and try to spot the differences. My hunch is that there won't be any.'</p> <p>Maff has been stuck with a slaughter policy since the 1920s when it overrode the protests of small farmers, who saw no need for animals with a minor illness to be massacred, in the interests of big farmers, who wanted to eliminate a disease which reduced auction prices. My colleague Anthony Browne was referred to a study from the 1950s by the Maff press office when he asked if slaughter was the best policy. It was as if all the modern advances in vaccination had never happened. Macedonia and Albania vaccinated successfully to stop the spread of the disease in 1996. But it has not been considered here for fear it would jeopardise a livestock export market worth a paltry \u00a3570 million.</p> <p>Dissent has its risks. The Elm Farm Research Centre, a Berkshire agricultural charity, had to promise vets anonymity when it asked them to discuss the merits of vaccination. Public exposure would threaten their careers. The slaughtermen in the NFU, meanwhile, are presented as the sole representatives of farmers (just as the Countryside Alliance is presented as sole representative of the countryside) though only 53,000 of the 180,000 farmers in England and Wales are members.</p> <p>Farmers' organisations who favour vaccination are shut out. Mike Hart of the Small and Family Farmers Alliance told me how he and other small farming groups had tried to get past Maff and into see Blair to argue against mass slaughter. They gave up after 'hitting the proverbial brick wall'. What we are witnessing is the sanctification of a dubious slaughter policy with little concern for the public interest.</p> <p>Stephen Tindale, who was Meacher's political adviser at the Department of the Environment until earlier this year, is not surprised. He remembered the Government receiving pathetic complaints from farm workers afflicted with depression, lassitude and chronic muscular pains - the effects, they maintained of organo-phosphate sheep dips. Maff officials dismissed their claims. No one knew if the sheep dip was the culprit, they said, but the Institute of Occupational Medicine in Edinburgh was on the case. The Institute duly reported that a link between exposure to sheep dip and 'chronic peripheral neuropathy' [damage to the nervous system] was 'suggested' by its research. Whitehall's Committee on Toxicity preferred to bin the report and uphold the reputation of the agri-chemical industry.</p> <p>They may have been right to do so, I'm not qualified to judge. I do know that a majority of supposedly sovereign consumers do not want GM foods, but public opinion did not stop Maff and Lord Sainsbury bowing to the wishes of the GM conglomerates regardless. Witnesses at Maff meetings described the insouciance of officials as they discussed the slow elimination of organic farming by GM crop contamination.</p> <p>As with sheep dips and organic food, so with foot and mouth. Many have criticised postponing elections and wrecking the tourist industry for the sake of livestock exports, and counted the price in pounds and votes. Fewer have looked at what I can only call the spiritual consequences. For hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, rambling is an escape from regimentation. They have lost the right to roam. They are being told that the slaughter of Herdwick sheep will transform the open fells of the Lake District into a scrubland no one who has loved Wordsworth or followed a Wainwright guide will recognise - and that the Peak District could follow.</p> <p>The absence of a public outcry about restrictions on freedom of movement is a sign of deference which is on a par with the ability of Virgin Train directors to appear in public without bodyguards. A more assertive citizenry would wonder why it is that Albania and Macedonia can vaccinate their way out of foot and mouth when we can't.</p> <p><b>Email update</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/email\">Sign up for our free daily foot and mouth round-up</a><br><br><b>More on the election and foot and mouth</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/footandmouth\">Politics: foot and mouth</a></p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/list\">Full list: outbreaks </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,464555,00.html\">Graph: rise in cases</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,460510,00.html\">Full list: closed &amp; cancelled</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\">Causes and effects</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/theissues/article/0,6512,441031,00.html\">The issue explained</a><br><br><b>The front line: meet those affected by the crisis</b><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,467836,00.html\">03.04.2001: Straws in the wind</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html  \">06.03.2001: Meet our panel</a><br><br><b>Related articles</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,469559,00.html\">06.04.2001: \u00a3120m boost for tourism</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,469518,00.html\">06.04.2001, comment: Pig in the middle</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,469265,00.html\">06.04.2001: Burial mound suggested to cut west's surplus of carcasses</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,469284,00.html\">06.04.2001: Man shot in head with bolt gun dies</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,469370,00.html\">06.04.2001, analysis: No reason to be cheerful -

      "bodyText": "\"What should be done with Maff?\" cried Ian Willmore, media coordinator for Friends of the Earth. '\"What should be done with Maff? Maff should be shot in the head, dumped in a trench, fried to a cinder, sprinkled with quicklime and buried with a stake through its heart, that's what should be done with Maff ...and you can quote me on that if you want.\" In normal circumstances quotation would be all but pointless. Willmore would be a voice from the green fringe, which could be dismissed by those whose opinions matter with the killer condemnatory sentence: 'No one takes him seriously.' Not this time, I think. The foot and mouth epidemic has had the cheering effect of shifting the fringe to the mainstream. I've never found New Labour politicians and advisers as furious or as willing to talk to Leftie hacks. Undoubtedly the anger has been caused in part by the postponement of elections. But it is elevated by a less partisan contempt for the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and a determination that it should share the fate of millions of beasts. 'We've learned the hard way that the department which gave us BSE is the last organisation you want on your side in a crisis,' said one. The official line is that the fall in the daily count of new cases shows that the slaughter programme is 'beginning to bite'. No one wants to contradict guarded optimism in public. In private, however, many worry about spread rather than numbers. There may be fewer outbreaks but they are popping up all over the country - in Shropshire, Cornwall, and the Peak District. This does not look like an emergency which has been contained. Above all, the strength of the disease in Cumbria terrifies officials. \"I don't know if we can stop it sweeping across to the Humber, however many animals we slaughter,' said one member of the Downing Street crisis team. 'We may have to think about vaccination again.\" Opposition to vaccination is the ruling passion of the National Farmers' Union and Maff (the NFU's political wing). If their dogma is overturned both will be humiliated and Maff may die of shame and be replaced by a Ministry for Rural Affairs. Sticking to slaughter until the last cow dies in the last ditch suits their interests, but administrative convenience may not be enough to save Maff when New Labour's confrontation with the Ministry has been so disillusioning. The party came to power as modernisers. In agriculture, as in so much else, 'modernity' meant more of the same. A party adviser described Maff as a dumping ground for civil servants. The wages were lower, the chances of moving on to a better job in Whitehall non-existent. A posting to Maff was the bureaucratic equivalent of a Politburo order to take up duties at a Mongolian power station or - to mix continents, and quite possibly metaphors as well - to check in for an indefinite stay at the Hotel California. \"It was a secretive, depressed place,' he said, 'very suspicious of change, very defensive. New Ministers and new permanent secretaries can't stop the treacle layer of senior civil servants trapping new ideas.\" Jack Cunningham, the first Labour Agriculture Minister, at least tried to change the privileges granted to the NFU by the Tories. He also noticed that while his office was a 10 feet square coop without a desk, senior civil servants were housed in some splendour. Cunningham made a fuss and the stories about 'Junket Jack', which were to help finish his career, duly appeared. The Civil Service can be vicious when crossed. 'Expect articles about how Nick Brown failed to heed the sound advice of righteous officials to surface within days,' my new friend predicted. Back-covering briefers will have to work hard. The suicidally honest Michael Meacher blurted out last week that there will be an inquiry when the mess is finally cleared up and was reprimanded for telling the truth. When it comes, as it will, the investigators must ask: why a Maff inspector missed the initial outbreak? Why animal movements were allowed for four days after foot and mouth was discovered? When did Maff officials warn Ministers that trouble was coming? Why were misleading figures on detection and slaughter rates fed to Downing Street? How rigorous was Maff in cracking down on the 'black sheep' smuggling market of subsidy-fiddling farmers? And why was the conclusion that the Army and epidemiologists should be called in at once, which had been reached by the inquiries into the 1967-68 outbreak, ignored? The last question has provoked many accusations in the past few days. But exiles from Maff argue that it should be rephrased. 'Someone should look at all the contingency plans from '68 to the present day,' said one, 'and try to spot the differences. My hunch is that there won't be any.' Maff has been stuck with a slaughter policy since the 1920s when it overrode the protests of small farmers, who saw no need for animals with a minor illness to be massacred, in the interests of big farmers, who wanted to eliminate a disease which reduced auction prices. My colleague Anthony Browne was referred to a study from the 1950s by the Maff press office when he asked if slaughter was the best policy. It was as if all the modern advances in vaccination had never happened. Macedonia and Albania vaccinated successfully to stop the spread of the disease in 1996. But it has not been considered here for fear it would jeopardise a livestock export market worth a paltry \u00a3570 million. Dissent has its risks. The Elm Farm Research Centre, a Berkshire agricultural charity, had to promise vets anonymity when it asked them to discuss the merits of vaccination. Public exposure would threaten their careers. The slaughtermen in the NFU, meanwhile, are presented as the sole representatives of farmers (just as the Countryside Alliance is presented as sole representative of the countryside) though only 53,000 of the 180,000 farmers in England and Wales are members. Farmers' organisations who favour vaccination are shut out. Mike Hart of the Small and Family Farmers Alliance told me how he and other small farming groups had tried to get past Maff and into see Blair to argue against mass slaughter. They gave up after 'hitting the proverbial brick wall'. What we are witnessing is the sanctification of a dubious slaughter policy with little concern for the public interest. Stephen Tindale, who was Meacher's political adviser at the Department of the Environment until earlier this year, is not surprised. He remembered the Government receiving pathetic complaints from farm workers afflicted with depression, lassitude and chronic muscular pains - the effects, they maintained of organo-phosphate sheep dips. Maff officials dismissed their claims. No one knew if the sheep dip was the culprit, they said, but the Institute of Occupational Medicine in Edinburgh was on the case. The Institute duly reported that a link between exposure to sheep dip and 'chronic peripheral neuropathy' [damage to the nervous system] was 'suggested' by its research. Whitehall's Committee on Toxicity preferred to bin the report and uphold the reputation of the agri-chemical industry. They may have been right to do so, I'm not qualified to judge. I do know that a majority of supposedly sovereign consumers do not want GM foods, but public opinion did not stop Maff and Lord Sainsbury bowing to the wishes of the GM conglomerates regardless. Witnesses at Maff meetings described the insouciance of officials as they discussed the slow elimination of organic farming by GM crop contamination. As with sheep dips and organic food, so with foot and mouth. Many have criticised postponing elections and wrecking the tourist industry for the sake of livestock exports, and counted the price in pounds and votes. Fewer have looked at what I can only call the spiritual consequences. For hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, rambling is an escape from regimentation. They have lost the right to roam. They are being told that the slaughter of Herdwick sheep will transform the open fells of the Lake District into a scrubland no one who has loved Wordsworth or followed a Wainwright guide will recognise - and that the Peak District could follow. The absence of a public outcry about restrictions on freedom of movement is a sign of deference which is on a par with the ability of Virgin Train directors to appear in public without bodyguards. A more assertive citizenry would wonder why it is that Albania and Macedonia can vaccinate their way out of foot and mouth when we can't.

This week the Government is to plead with Britain's leading stars to help save the country's beleaguered tourism industry.</p> <p>As Downing Street's pro-tourism push threatened to descend into chaos yesterday with footpaths remaining closed throughout the country, Tony Blair personally endorsed moves to approach an eclectic mix of characters as diverse as the artist Tracey Emin and Michael Owen, the footballer.</p> <p>They will be asked to talk about their favourite parts of Britain for a major tourism push across the world.</p> <p>Denise Lewis, David Beckham, the Spice Girls and Geri Halliwell will also be asked to contribute to the 'UK is OK' campaign.</p> <p>In a plan hatched with the Department of Culture, the British Tourist Authority is to write to figures such as Robbie Williams, Sir Michael Caine and Sir Elton John asking them for 'a paragraph to help the country'. They will be asked to write 10 lines on why they love Britain and will be invited to events in London and around the country aimed at proving to the world that Britain is not closed for business.</p> <p>Officials have been delighted with the contributions Sir Sean Connery and Hugh Grant have made to selling Britain abroad, and hope that enough famous faces agree to take part in the campaign.</p> <p>If they don't, officials admit that it would be an embarrassing snub. The move comes as the multi-million-pound losses from the foot and mouth crisis mount and the Government watches with increasing fear for signs that not only the Easter tourist season has been ruined but the summer one as well.</p> <p>In some parts of the country, notably Cumbria and Devon, earnings from tourism have collapsed by 80 per cent.</p> <p>The English Tourist Council estimates it is losing up to \u00a3200 million a week because visitors, particularly those from overseas, are staying away from the countryside.</p> <p>Blair has decided that he can ride out criticism that Labour is too interested in the world of fame and big money if the 'your country needs you' policy can be shown to work.</p> <p>Government officials say that, although Ministers such as John Prescott have been gamely taking to the tourism trail, such stunts do little to enthuse the public.</p> <p>'We have people who are famous around the world and we need to use that to sell Britain,' said a Government source. 'That may get a quicker result than John bobbing around in a boat on the Norfolk Broads.'</p> <p>The 'stars save Britain' policy will start in earnest next week with the visit of England's leading football teams to the Continent to play in the Champions League.</p> <p>When Manchester United travel to Bayern Munich, Beckham, Andy Cole, Ryan Giggs and the rest will be accompanied by officials from the BTA who will encourage them to give interviews ex-tolling the virtues of Britain to a difficult-to-convince German public.</p> <p>Similar policies will be used when Arsenal and Leeds travel to Spain to play matches against Valencia and Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a.</p> <p>'We are not only talking about British stars selling Britain,' the government source said. 'We want to see the likes of Thierry Henry [the Arsenal forward who is from France] saying what he likes about Britain. That would go down very well.'</p> <p>The BTA has also written to Madonna to enlist her help. The Government hopes that the stars will be a more direct conduit to the general public than the hundreds of official statements saying that the countryside is a safe place to visit. 'We have to overcome some of the myths that are travelling around the world,' said a BTA spokeswoman.</p> <p>She said that, because of overblown media reports, people in America think that they have to bring their own food, that they will have to leave their clothes behind to be incinerated, and that people can catch foot and mouth.</p> <p>The job of the BTA was not helped yesterday when an article in the New York Times , the bible of liberal America, said: 'Is anything going right in Britain these days? If so, it's hard to tell.'</p> <p>The Government and the tourism industry insist that there are glimmers of hope appearing on the horizon. The English Tourism Council said there was anecdotal evidence of tourists returning to the countryside. A spokes-man said: 'A few places, like Lake Windermere and coastal locations, seem to be busy. There is a sense things are starting to change a bit. The message is starting to get through that Britain is busy.'</p> <p>Howard Christie, owner of the Wasdale Inn Hotel in the Lake District, suffered a 97 per cent drop in takings in March, from \u00a345,000 last year to \u00a31,200 this year, but he is full this weekend because of support from customers.</p> <p>'They heard about our plight and they've come back to support us,' he said.

      "bodyText": "Not since Cool Britannia died in a mess of recriminations over Labour's relationship with the world of pop and art has such a call to arms been seen. This week the Government is to plead with Britain's leading stars to help save the country's beleaguered tourism industry. As Downing Street's pro-tourism push threatened to descend into chaos yesterday with footpaths remaining closed throughout the country, Tony Blair personally endorsed moves to approach an eclectic mix of characters as diverse as the artist Tracey Emin and Michael Owen, the footballer. They will be asked to talk about their favourite parts of Britain for a major tourism push across the world. Denise Lewis, David Beckham, the Spice Girls and Geri Halliwell will also be asked to contribute to the 'UK is OK' campaign. In a plan hatched with the Department of Culture, the British Tourist Authority is to write to figures such as Robbie Williams, Sir Michael Caine and Sir Elton John asking them for 'a paragraph to help the country'. They will be asked to write 10 lines on why they love Britain and will be invited to events in London and around the country aimed at proving to the world that Britain is not closed for business. Officials have been delighted with the contributions Sir Sean Connery and Hugh Grant have made to selling Britain abroad, and hope that enough famous faces agree to take part in the campaign. If they don't, officials admit that it would be an embarrassing snub. The move comes as the multi-million-pound losses from the foot and mouth crisis mount and the Government watches with increasing fear for signs that not only the Easter tourist season has been ruined but the summer one as well. In some parts of the country, notably Cumbria and Devon, earnings from tourism have collapsed by 80 per cent. The English Tourist Council estimates it is losing up to \u00a3200 million a week because visitors, particularly those from overseas, are staying away from the countryside. Blair has decided that he can ride out criticism that Labour is too interested in the world of fame and big money if the 'your country needs you' policy can be shown to work. Government officials say that, although Ministers such as John Prescott have been gamely taking to the tourism trail, such stunts do little to enthuse the public. 'We have people who are famous around the world and we need to use that to sell Britain,' said a Government source. 'That may get a quicker result than John bobbing around in a boat on the Norfolk Broads.' The 'stars save Britain' policy will start in earnest next week with the visit of England's leading football teams to the Continent to play in the Champions League. When Manchester United travel to Bayern Munich, Beckham, Andy Cole, Ryan Giggs and the rest will be accompanied by officials from the BTA who will encourage them to give interviews ex-tolling the virtues of Britain to a difficult-to-convince German public. Similar policies will be used when Arsenal and Leeds travel to Spain to play matches against Valencia and Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a. 'We are not only talking about British stars selling Britain,' the government source said. 'We want to see the likes of Thierry Henry [the Arsenal forward who is from France] saying what he likes about Britain. That would go down very well.' The BTA has also written to Madonna to enlist her help. The Government hopes that the stars will be a more direct conduit to the general public than the hundreds of official statements saying that the countryside is a safe place to visit. 'We have to overcome some of the myths that are travelling around the world,' said a BTA spokeswoman. She said that, because of overblown media reports, people in America think that they have to bring their own food, that they will have to leave their clothes behind to be incinerated, and that people can catch foot and mouth. The job of the BTA was not helped yesterday when an article in the New York Times , the bible of liberal America, said: 'Is anything going right in Britain these days? If so, it's hard to tell.' The Government and the tourism industry insist that there are glimmers of hope appearing on the horizon. The English Tourism Council said there was anecdotal evidence of tourists returning to the countryside. A spokes-man said: 'A few places, like Lake Windermere and coastal locations, seem to be busy. There is a sense things are starting to change a bit. The message is starting to get through that Britain is busy.' Howard Christie, owner of the Wasdale Inn Hotel in the Lake District, suffered a 97 per cent drop in takings in March, from \u00a345,000 last year to \u00a31,200 this year, but he is full this weekend because of support from customers. 'They heard about our plight and they've come back to support us,' he said. 'It's our regular customers who are keeping us afloat. I even got sent a \u00a310 note through the post today. It's a nice thought.' Email update Sign up for our free daily foot and mouth round-up More on the election and foot and mouth Politics: foot and mouth What's going on?

A single IV line will be inserted in a vein.</p> <p>After all signs of McVeigh's life have been extinguished, the execution room 'will be cleaned and restored to its previous condition' - ready for another execution scheduled for three days later.</p> <p>Sympathy for McVeigh is hard to come by, especially since he recently referred to the 19 children killed by his handiwork as 'collateral damage', but it is clear that by setting the agenda - refusing all clemency appeals, arguing that his death should be broadcast not only as is planned to Oklahoma City's relatives and survivors but also to the world at large, ensuring that no post mortem is performed, and planning a political speech as his last words - he has wrested the symbolism of control from his executioners.</p> <p>McVeigh, a decorated Gulf War veteran, has never claimed innocence of the bombing, and though he has said it was 'terrible' that children were killed he maintains that it is the duty of US citizens to 'keep the government in check'.</p> <p>McVeigh has argued that since the government at his trial claimed that his victims were not just the dead and their families but America itself, everyone should be given the opportunity to witness his punishment. Only six of the victims' relatives will be allowed into the death chamber. Another 259 will be watching in an adjoining room on closed-circuit television.Moreover, by willing his executioners on, and saying that his death will be his crowning achievement - 'I'll be glad to leave this fucked-up world' - he has managed to rob advocates of his execution of any sense of righteous vengeance.</p> <p>'He has no major mental illness. He is a man of high ideals. But he was also a man who was alienated from most of mainstream America,' says John Smith, a psychiatrist who examined him. 'Most of the people that I see are crimes of passion, loss of control and mental illness. He was none of those things. He really feels nothing. He feels, in my opinion, fully justified in his actions.'</p>",

Sympathy for McVeigh is hard to come by, especially since he recently referred to the 19 children killed by his handiwork as 'collateral damage', but it is clear that by setting the agenda - refusing all clemency appeals, arguing that his death should be broadcast not only as is planned to Oklahoma City's relatives and survivors but also to the world at large, ensuring that no post mortem is performed, and planning a political speech as his last words - he has wrested the symbolism of control from his executioners. McVeigh, a decorated Gulf War veteran, has never claimed innocence of the bombing, and though he has said it was 'terrible' that children were killed he maintains that it is the duty of US citizens to 'keep the government in check'. McVeigh has argued that since the government at his trial claimed that his victims were not just the dead and their families but America itself, everyone should be given the opportunity to witness his punishment. Only six of the victims' relatives will be allowed into the death chamber. Another 259 will be watching in an adjoining room on closed-circuit television.Moreover, by willing his executioners on, and saying that his death will be his crowning achievement - 'I'll be glad to leave this fucked-up world' - he has managed to rob advocates of his execution of any sense of righteous vengeance. 'He has no major mental illness. He is a man of high ideals. But he was also a man who was alienated from most of mainstream America,' says John Smith, a psychiatrist who examined him. 'Most of the people that I see are crimes of passion, loss of control and mental illness. He was none of those things. He really feels nothing. He feels, in my opinion, fully justified in his actions.'",

Now they want their appearance fees raised to between \u00a32,000 and \u00a32,500 and their research expenses raised from \u00a3250 to \u00a3300 per hour. Junior barristers can earn \u00a3750 in appearance fees and \u00a3100 per hour in research expenses. They want their appearance fees raised to between \u00a31,000 and \u00a31,250. The Northern Ireland Office said the matter had been referred to a special cost sitting to be held in London later this month. 'We will want to see the claims investigated very seriously and the grounds on which they are made.' Peter Madden, a senior partner with Madden and Finucane, the firm representing most of the families, defended the pay claim by its staff and called on the MoD to reveal how much its lawyers were being paid to defend soldiers on duty on the day of the killings. So far, he claimed, the MoD has resisted their demands to disclose their legal fees. The Ministry of Defence has spent \u00a38 million on the inquiry. 'All we are looking for is parity with the English lawyers and the firms that are representing the soldiers. 'We have been told they are earning more than lawyers representing the victims' families. The action is being taken so the costing judge can reveal exactly the amount of money the MoD's lawyers are receiving.' Peter Pringle, a writer who investigated the aftermath of the massacre, also questioned the ethics of the legal costs. 'The real fault here lies with the British Government, who should have seen this coming,' he said. 'Perhaps it would have been better to have had an independent judicial inquiry, maybe with judges from overseas, than something like this which has got out of control. Certainly at the very outset the government should have laid down fixed fees and expenses before this got out of hand.'",

      "body": "<p>As we enter upon a new Cold War, the time has come for all those who value freedom to change sides. Today the aggressive, imperial power bent on imposing its hegemony on the world is the United States. And the power upholding the sanctity of international law is Russia.</p> <p>The Russians now embody the hope of all nations that, no matter how small, they can survive as independent sovereign states. They and the Chinese - deadly rivals during the Cold War - are close allies. The downed US spy plane on Hainan Island helps explain why. The Chinese are understandably fed up with round-the-clock US spying flights near their territory. They are angry at disingenuous US claims that essentially military aircraft flying a few miles from their borders are somehow in 'international air space', and that spy planes landing without permission on Chinese territory are to be considered US sovereign property.</p> <p>Last year Russia logged around 1,000 spying flights by the US and other Nato countries. Ten years ago the Russians, exhausted by 74 years of Communism and a ruinous Cold War, gave up their empire without firing a shot. All they wanted was to be left alone to address their domestic problems, but they did not count on Washington's machinations. Determined to reduce Russia to permanent weakness, the US resolved to surround Russia with Nato satellite states.

      "bodyText": "As we enter upon a new Cold War, the time has come for all those who value freedom to change sides. Today the aggressive, imperial power bent on imposing its hegemony on the world is the United States. And the power upholding the sanctity of international law is Russia. The Russians now embody the hope of all nations that, no matter how small, they can survive as independent sovereign states. They and the Chinese - deadly rivals during the Cold War - are close allies. The downed US spy plane on Hainan Island helps explain why. The Chinese are understandably fed up with round-the-clock US spying flights near their territory. They are angry at disingenuous US claims that essentially military aircraft flying a few miles from their borders are somehow in 'international air space', and that spy planes landing without permission on Chinese territory are to be considered US sovereign property. Last year Russia logged around 1,000 spying flights by the US and other Nato countries. Ten years ago the Russians, exhausted by 74 years of Communism and a ruinous Cold War, gave up their empire without firing a shot. All they wanted was to be left alone to address their domestic problems, but they did not count on Washington's machinations. Determined to reduce Russia to permanent weakness, the US resolved to surround Russia with Nato satellite states. Swiftly breaking its solemnly proffered pledges at the time of Germany's reunification that Nato would not expand eastwards, the US bullied its junior Nato partners into inviting Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to become members.

McCann is often scathing of politicians - whatever party they come from - but to say the event was politically star-studded is an understatement. Chancellor Gordon Brown was joined by Scottish Secretary Helen Liddell and Scotland's First Minister Henry McLeish. SNP leader John Swinney was among the speakers. Yet less than a mile to the west, along the river Clyde, one of the Holyrood Parliament's most famous members was addressing a very different gathering. Perhaps only 200 people crammed into a small club to listen to Tommy Sheridan, of the Scottish Socialist Party, but their passion was as tangible as that of the thousands up river. Having led anti-poll tax and anti-Trident campaigns Sheridan is no stranger to controversy, and he wants to see a dramatically different approach - the legalisation of cannabis. He believes that this would break the link between the substance and hard drugs, cutting the dealers out of the equation. Sheridan, who does not drink, smoke or take drugs, believes heroin should be available to addicts on prescription, as in Switzerland, Holland and Germany. 'Break the link, take away the crime,' he says.

      "body": "<p>I wonder what went through Slobodan Milosevic's mind when he heard the news, in October of 1998, that Chile's former dictator, Augusto Pinochet, had been arrested in London by detectives of Scotland Yard, accused by a Spanish judge of genocide and torture. Did Milosevic tremble at the idea that a foreign court could put former heads of state on trial? Did he foresee what might befall him? Or did he feel strengthened by the humiliation of his Chilean counterpart and determined never find himself at the mercy of any judge whatsoever, foreign or Serbian?</p> <p>Whatever the thoughts of Milosevic might have been at the time, it was the latter thesis about his state of mind that prevailed in the years to come. As I made the rounds of radio and TV programmes defending the need to put former dictators on trial in countries other than their own if those lands were incapable of doing so, I was invariably greeted by the misgivings of commentators and call-in listeners alike who were certain that indictments like the one Pinochet was facing would encourage oppressors to stay in power against all odds until their last round of ammunition was spent.</p> <p>Wasn't it better to let the dictators go quietly with their booty into the night of retirement and relieve the people suffering under their boot from the distress of a protracted civil conflict? Wasn't that a small price to pay for the lives saved? And wasn't this an affair best left to the citizens of the affected nation who, after all, would be the ones to benefit from a quick departure by the current despot?</p> <p>And Milosevic was the name that kept coming up, particularly after the International War Crimes Tribunal at the Hague indicted the then Yugoslav President in May 1999 for crimes against humanity. Wait and see, I was told; the trial of General Pinochet will delay the end of Milosevic indefinitely.</p> <p>We have waited and we have seen. We have seen the people of Serbia rise against Milosevic in October 2000. We have seen no pampering of the Yugoslav despot, no safeguards offered against future prosecutions in order to convince him to leave office.</p> <p>We have seen that the predicted bloodbath did not materialise despite the fact that no guarantee of total immunity was offered to Milosevic and his cronies. And, six months later, the former strongman of Serbia sits in a Belgrade prison facing charges of corruption and abuse of power, with the threat of extradition to the Hague to face the United Nations tribunal still hanging over his head.</p> <p>Though one cannot and should not doubt that the protests of thousands of Serbian men and women who - as in the case of Chile or Poland or Indonesia, just to mention some salient cases from three continents in the last decades - were ultimately responsible for the ousting of the regime that was oppressing them, it is equally true that we should not underestimate the role that international pressure plays not only in the fall of a dictatorship but also in ensuring that officials of the former government can be brought to justice.</p> <p>If this insistent demand from abroad that there be some form of accountability turns out to be so essential, it is because of a bizarre moral sickness that infests transitions to democracy in our time. I have seen the situation in my own Chile and remark it now once more in Yugoslavia. It is members of the new government - the people who led the resistance against the dictatorship - who are all too often the ones preaching selective amnesia, asking their citizens to focus on the future and not on what happened yesterday. Investigating the horror, dragging up old crimes and putting former officials on trial only diverts attention from the primary goal of national reconciliation, they say.</p> <p>In the case of Chile, the newly-elected democratic leaders failed to realise that this mythic coming together of a fractured nation could not possibly be attained by ignoring the pain of the past.

      "bodyText": "I wonder what went through Slobodan Milosevic's mind when he heard the news, in October of 1998, that Chile's former dictator, Augusto Pinochet, had been arrested in London by detectives of Scotland Yard, accused by a Spanish judge of genocide and torture. Did Milosevic tremble at the idea that a foreign court could put former heads of state on trial? Did he foresee what might befall him? Or did he feel strengthened by the humiliation of his Chilean counterpart and determined never find himself at the mercy of any judge whatsoever, foreign or Serbian? Whatever the thoughts of Milosevic might have been at the time, it was the latter thesis about his state of mind that prevailed in the years to come. As I made the rounds of radio and TV programmes defending the need to put former dictators on trial in countries other than their own if those lands were incapable of doing so, I was invariably greeted by the misgivings of commentators and call-in listeners alike who were certain that indictments like the one Pinochet was facing would encourage oppressors to stay in power against all odds until their last round of ammunition was spent. Wasn't it better to let the dictators go quietly with their booty into the night of retirement and relieve the people suffering under their boot from the distress of a protracted civil conflict? Wasn't that a small price to pay for the lives saved? And wasn't this an affair best left to the citizens of the affected nation who, after all, would be the ones to benefit from a quick departure by the current despot? And Milosevic was the name that kept coming up, particularly after the International War Crimes Tribunal at the Hague indicted the then Yugoslav President in May 1999 for crimes against humanity. Wait and see, I was told; the trial of General Pinochet will delay the end of Milosevic indefinitely. We have waited and we have seen. We have seen the people of Serbia rise against Milosevic in October 2000. We have seen no pampering of the Yugoslav despot, no safeguards offered against future prosecutions in order to convince him to leave office. We have seen that the predicted bloodbath did not materialise despite the fact that no guarantee of total immunity was offered to Milosevic and his cronies. And, six months later, the former strongman of Serbia sits in a Belgrade prison facing charges of corruption and abuse of power, with the threat of extradition to the Hague to face the United Nations tribunal still hanging over his head. Though one cannot and should not doubt that the protests of thousands of Serbian men and women who - as in the case of Chile or Poland or Indonesia, just to mention some salient cases from three continents in the last decades - were ultimately responsible for the ousting of the regime that was oppressing them, it is equally true that we should not underestimate the role that international pressure plays not only in the fall of a dictatorship but also in ensuring that officials of the former government can be brought to justice. If this insistent demand from abroad that there be some form of accountability turns out to be so essential, it is because of a bizarre moral sickness that infests transitions to democracy in our time. I have seen the situation in my own Chile and remark it now once more in Yugoslavia. It is members of the new government - the people who led the resistance against the dictatorship - who are all too often the ones preaching selective amnesia, asking their citizens to focus on the future and not on what happened yesterday. Investigating the horror, dragging up old crimes and putting former officials on trial only diverts attention from the primary goal of national reconciliation, they say. In the case of Chile, the newly-elected democratic leaders failed to realise that this mythic coming together of a fractured nation could not possibly be attained by ignoring the pain of the past. They did not realise that the cost of allowing the former ruler and his followers utter immunity was the erosion of the rule of law and the mortgaging of our ethical future. It was only after a high court in Spain decided to carry out the trial of our dictator - something that we Chileans had repeatedly proclaimed we were unable and unwilling to do - that we were shamed into prosecuting Pinochet once he had been returned to Santiago in January of 2000 for spurious medical reasons. The continuing trial of Pinochet and the trial of Milosevic that is about to begin therefore prove to us that the increasing authority of international tribunals help rather than hinder the search for justice at local and at international levels. Somewhere, nearby, now or tomorrow, another despot must be watching these indictments against former heads of state and may well be telling himself: 'I will stay on to the very end, this will not happen to me, I am invincible.' Instead of responding that he is right and pledging absolute immunity in order to cajole him out of power, we should be proclaiming that the international community will not sit by and let the crimes of the past be forgotten. We should be demanding that he look into the cracked mirror of Milosevic and into the murderous, hunted eyes of Pinochet and see, once and for all, his future. \u0095 The latest novel by Ariel Dorfman, the author of Death and the Maiden, is The Nanny and the Iceberg, published by Sceptre, \u00a36.99",

In last week's News of the World interview, granted to stop the paper publishing tapes of her indiscretions, she dutifully discussed her husband's sexuality and her fertility (he isn't gay and she might consider IVF). Those confessions, approved by courtiers, form a neat sequel to the Sun 's decision, two years ago, to print a topless picture bought for \u00a3100,000 by the editor, David Yelland, who was thought to have the support of his then deputy, Rebekah Wade. As editor of the News of the World, Ms Wade was responsible for the sting under which 'Sheikh' Mazher Mahmood, the paper's undercover agent, elicited the Rhys-Jones remarks over champagne and surveillance bugs. But this time round, Ms Wade was initially less eager to reveal all. Indeed, it seemed possible that the NoW , anxious about Palace wrath, was groping for the exit handily illuminated by Simon Walker, the Queen's communications director.</p> <p>If the countess is not very good at personal PR, then Mr Walker could not lend a camel to a stranded sheikh. The Palace's course of bartering suppression for an interview seems inexplicable, unless it was done in blind panic or at the sage behest of Lord Wakeham, the chairman of the Press Complaints Commission. Wakeham denies this, claiming that 'as far as I can recall', the first he heard about an interview was after it had taken place. Given this short-term memory problem, it is possible that Wakeham may not fully recollect his role in the topless pictures episode, from which he emerged with little credit after administering a mild rebuke to Yelland.</p> <p>Since then, however, Wakeham has become very intertwined with royalty, famously attracting Charles, Camilla and William to his PCC anniversary party. As a helpmate to the mighty, he guided the Prime Minister through the row over Leo's snatched christening pictures and, in the Sophie d\u00e9bcle, he gave the Palace 'exactly the same advice that the PCC offers to countless members of the public'. Except that the harassed masses do not have a hotline to his lordship. But whether or not the Palace sought or got a bespoke service prior to its disastrous course of action, Wakeham needs to worry, as do we all, that the weird spectacle of the royal family invading its own privacy may portend less a Rabelaisian feast of intrusion than a backlash of greater restriction.</p> <p>While the Wakeham intervention, however minor, looks ill-starred, the News of the World emerges with much less credit. Mr Mahmood must have been livid that his scoop was sacrificed to a bit of vulgar, Palace-blessed twaddle, whose fall-out is unlikely to trouble the silkily efficient Mark Bolland, spin doctor to the Prince of Wales. Charles is thought to welcome any evidence that minor royals should get the boot, a wish that ignores the fact that major ones look more contaminated. If Edward Wessex is a charmless self-promoter with a penchant for a fast buck, then such traits are hardly remarkable in the child of someone who is worth \u00a350 million, saves old string and long believed that income tax was something that one's poor people paid.</p> <p>Despite the public discontent reflected in the royal family's recent private polling, it remains poor form to criticise the Queen. Hence the widespread fondness for displacement activities, such as rubbishing her vulgar daughter-in-law. But if Rhys-Jones is guilty of confusing her roles and exploiting her position, she is only playing by the long-established rules of a ramshackle monarchy whose wizened tentacles extend into politics, religion and the petty-cash tin. If we don't like the institution, we should argue for its demise rather than indulging in squeaky outrage if Sophie calls the Queen the 'old dear' or gloating every time Princess Margaret has another stroke. Royal-baiting, at that level, is only a buy-in to the out-of-touch heartlessness we affect to deplore.</p> <p>Increasingly, the monarchy exists as a licence for hypocrisy, as peddled by citizens and government. While any hint from Mo Mowlam that the royals might settle for futons and Ikea sofas is greeted as almost treasonable, Margaret Beckett, Kim ('A bit bonkers') Howells and Stephen Byers are presumed to bask in Blair's approval for upbraiding a woman whose garrulous ways may contain some lessons for on-message Blairites.</p> <p>If only Mr Byers were more seducible by fake sheikhs bearing champagne, how much better informed on trade and industry we all might be. More relevantly, politicians should be less worried by the confected Sophie scandal than by the constitutional implications of Charles the moderniser cleaving to all the monarchy's arcane powers while pursuing a new, quasi-political agenda on GM food, the countryside and squaring science with 'a sense of the sacred'.</p> <p>Miss Rhys-Jones, for her part, fits more neatly into the world of the profane. That should not diminish the fact that she deserves heroine status if, as seems just possible, her indiscretions finally prompt the debate we should have had long ago on what the royals are for. But even if the current, frothed-up fuss subsides and Sophie, so abysmally served by allies and enemies, is forced to abandon PR for a less controversial career, such as aromatherapy or promoting Britain's interests abroad, she has had her moment of glory.</p> <p>Not only has she provided the Emmerdale-in-ermine pageantry we demand of an otherwise otiose monarchy; she has also, inadvertently, highlighted the methodology of politicians, courtiers, royals, regulators and sections of the press. If the charge is venality, then the Countess of Wessex has proved that, in such distinguished company, she is merely a promising beginner.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.rjhpr.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">R-JH public relations</a><br><a href=\"http://www.royal.gov.uk/family/edward.htm\" target=\"_new\">Buckingham palace biography of Duke of Wessex</a><br><a href=\"http://members.tripod.com/~royalty12/\" target=\"_new\">Sophie Wessex fan site</a></p>",

If Edward Wessex is a charmless self-promoter with a penchant for a fast buck, then such traits are hardly remarkable in the child of someone who is worth \u00a350 million, saves old string and long believed that income tax was something that one's poor people paid. Despite the public discontent reflected in the royal family's recent private polling, it remains poor form to criticise the Queen. Hence the widespread fondness for displacement activities, such as rubbishing her vulgar daughter-in-law. But if Rhys-Jones is guilty of confusing her roles and exploiting her position, she is only playing by the long-established rules of a ramshackle monarchy whose wizened tentacles extend into politics, religion and the petty-cash tin. If we don't like the institution, we should argue for its demise rather than indulging in squeaky outrage if Sophie calls the Queen the 'old dear' or gloating every time Princess Margaret has another stroke. Royal-baiting, at that level, is only a buy-in to the out-of-touch heartlessness we affect to deplore. Increasingly, the monarchy exists as a licence for hypocrisy, as peddled by citizens and government. While any hint from Mo Mowlam that the royals might settle for futons and Ikea sofas is greeted as almost treasonable, Margaret Beckett, Kim ('A bit bonkers') Howells and Stephen Byers are presumed to bask in Blair's approval for upbraiding a woman whose garrulous ways may contain some lessons for on-message Blairites. If only Mr Byers were more seducible by fake sheikhs bearing champagne, how much better informed on trade and industry we all might be. More relevantly, politicians should be less worried by the confected Sophie scandal than by the constitutional implications of Charles the moderniser cleaving to all the monarchy's arcane powers while pursuing a new, quasi-political agenda on GM food, the countryside and squaring science with 'a sense of the sacred'. Miss Rhys-Jones, for her part, fits more neatly into the world of the profane. That should not diminish the fact that she deserves heroine status if, as seems just possible, her indiscretions finally prompt the debate we should have had long ago on what the royals are for. But even if the current, frothed-up fuss subsides and Sophie, so abysmally served by allies and enemies, is forced to abandon PR for a less controversial career, such as aromatherapy or promoting Britain's interests abroad, she has had her moment of glory. Not only has she provided the Emmerdale-in-ermine pageantry we demand of an otherwise otiose monarchy; she has also, inadvertently, highlighted the methodology of politicians, courtiers, royals, regulators and sections of the press. If the charge is venality, then the Countess of Wessex has proved that, in such distinguished company, she is merely a promising beginner.

It apparently involves the Queen, her children, the Prime Minister's wife, cocaine, prostitutes, hundreds of thousands of pounds and a man posing as a sheikh who puts on a funny accent. As tabloid journalists say, you couldn't make it up.</p> <p>The entrapment of the Countess of Wessex by the News of the World has provided an insight into the way that some newspapers still work in 2001. It is also shaking the fabric of the royal family. How on earth did constitutional historians end up on Radio 4 solemnly discussing the fall-out from an interview headlined 'Sophie: My Edward is not gay'?</p> <p>Almost two months ago, 32-year-old Kishen Athulathmudali, an employee of the Countess of Wessex's Mayfair PR firm R-JH, telephoned Max Clifford, the veteran public relations expert. The account director claimed that R-JH was using Sophie's royal connections to boost its client list.</p> <p>Clifford approached the Mail on Sunday with the story but when the paper's chief reporter Fiona Barton met Athulathmudali she decided that his claims were not interesting enough to pursue. So Clifford went to the News of the World. Athulathmudali was introduced to Mazher Mahmood, the paper's veteran investigations editor who specialises in 'sting' operations, often dressing as an Arab sheikh in order to entrap criminals.</p> <p>Mahmood became convinced that R-JH was offering 'coronets-for-cash', pledges of meetings with members of the royal family or invitations to state events in return for business. It was also suggested that potential new clients were being cold-called with invitations to dinner at Bagshot Park, the country home of Edward and Sophie. During the next fortnight, phone calls between Athulathmudali and Murray Harkin, Sophie's gregarious business partner, were recorded. Athulathmudali also went to the firm's Mayfair offices wired with recording equipment.</p> <p>The News of the World and its editor Rebekah Wade became convinced they had a major story. Not only would the story make a huge splash but it would also satisfy the deeply held republican instincts of its proprietor Rupert Murdoch.</p> <p>But Mahmood wanted just a little more. Just over three weeks ago he rang Harkin himself, posing as a sheikh who wanted to open an international sports facility in Dubai. The invention was shrewd. R-JH has had a number of sporting clients and Sophie first met Edward when she was promoting a real tennis tournament.</p> <p>Harkin may now regret his enthusiasm to meet as soon as possible. 'But it all fits in,' says one acquaintance who has known him for years. 'He's a do-it-today, get-on-with-it, push-ahead figure. He wants to try everything. Whenever you're with him, you feel upbeat.' Within 48 hours, two meetings were set up at the Dorchester Hotel in Park Lane, where Mahmood had hired a \u00a31,295-a-day suite.</p> <p>The meetings were both tape and video-recorded as Harkin enthusiastically offered his potential client 'the usual treatment'. In most PR companies, this is called 'schmoozing'. You offer a glimpse of the best you can offer, whether that be tables at the best restaurants or meetings with the chairman's wife, who happens to be a film star. It is all too easy to imagine what might be offered by keen staff working for Sophie, desperate to bring in business to a company in a notoriously precarious industry.</p> <p>But when Harkin turned up for the second Dorchester meeting, on a bright spring morning, Mahmood could not believe his luck. Sophie also appeared. Discovering a rather more sophisticated sheikh than she might have been expecting - this one was suave, quietly-spoken and suited - she had a lengthy conversation not only about her plans to promote his sporting centre, but also about various members of her family and politicians. The Queen was 'the old lady', William Hague was 'deformed' and Cherie Booth, the Prime Minister's wife was 'absolutely horrid, horrid, horrid', according to the countess.</p> <p>Believing she had 'sealed a deal', Sophie then went back to her South Audley Street offices prior to a lunch engagement. She thought she had secured \u00a320,000 a month for two years from the sheikh, almost half a million pounds in business from a morning's work. No wonder she was smiling when she arrived at her desk.</p> <p>However, by the end of the afternoon of Tuesday 20 March, the clouds had not only gathered over Mayfair, but over Sophie, the future of her business and her role in the royal family. In a telephone call which left her cold, she was advised of what had happened by an employee of the News of the World.</p> <p>Her first instinct was to phone Sir Robin Janvrin, the Queen's private secretary. He summoned communications secretary Simon Walker, on secondment from British Airways. The pair made an immediate conference call to Guy Black, director of the Press Complaints Commission.</p> <p>In the meantime, lawyers for R-JH rushed to the High Court in order to secure an injunction against Athulathmudali to prevent him publishing any information he had obtained in the course of his employment.</p> <p>What happened in the next 48 hours is a subject of bitter dispute between most of the principals involved. Black and Lord Wakeham, chairman of the PCC, visited Janvrin and Walker at Buckingham Palace on the afternoon of Wednesday 21 March. The PCC insist that they gave routine advice - either await publication and deal with the matter afterwards, or come to some accommodation with the News of the World. Both Black and Wakeham insist they do not know exactly what was agreed between Walker and the News of the World in subsequent phone calls. <br><br>Whoever said what to whom, the outcome was remarkable. Wade agreed that the paper would hand over the tapes of the conversations with the countess. In return, Sophie would volunteer an interview. The Palace would have complete approval of interviewer, copy and headlines.</p> <p>Thus Sophie, daughter-in-law of the Queen, ended up sitting in a Buckingham Palace drawing room on the morning of Thursday 22 March with Carole Aye Maung, a News of the World reporter. As Walker looked on, Sophie spoke about her private life, her fertility and, most remarkable of all, Edward's sexuality.</p> <p>Sometime within the next two days, Wade got cold feet. 'She met our managing director and we're almost certain that Rupert Murdoch was on the phone too,' says a reliable News International source. 'But it just wasn't clear what was going on. In the end, the paper appeared two weeks ago with neither the interview nor the original tapes in it. It was bizarre.'</p> <p>It was almost certainly Wade's indecision which led to the next remarkable twist in the story. Ten copies of the transcripts of the Mahmood interview had been passed around the News of the World 's Wapping offices. A number of frustrated staff were aware not only of the delay in publication, but also of the explosive nature of what had been suppressed in return for a soft interview with Sophie. It is almost certainly one of those staff who leaked a summary transcript to the Mail on Sunday, determined that their scoop would at least see the light of day there. Amazingly, Wade wavered once more.</p> <p>By Thursday 5 April, she had decided she would run the Sophie interview after all. She informed Buckingham Palace. On Friday morning, a fax of the proposed piece was sent to the Palace. The front page headline 'SOPHIE: My Edward is NOT gay' was the first part of the piece which appeared slowly from the fax machine in Walker's office.</p> <p>But when Walker called Wade back to confirm that the interview was acceptable, there was no suggestion that even the headline - the most candid statement ever made by a royal - should be changed. 'One or two minor things were amended,' says the News International source. 'That was all they asked for. It was staggering.'</p> <p>It was shortly after seeing the proposed article that Sophie - usually ice cool - had a 'wobble'. She penned private notes to Prince Charles, the Blairs, Hague and the Queen apologising for her indiscretions, even though she did not think they would ever reach the public domain. Wrong, yet again.</p> <p>By Saturday, Buckingham Palace had information too that the Mail on Sunday was going to run details of the original tapes. 'Normally there is relative calm under fire,' revealed one courtier. 'One of the good things about the Palace is that there are people around who have seen it all before. But the atmosphere last weekend was febrile. It was like waiting for shelling to start. People were already rowing with one another over who had been responsible for what.'</p> <p>The first volley hit the trench just after 10pm, when first editions of the Sunday newspapers arrived. The News of the World was exactly as expected, the Mail on Sunday even worse.</p> <p>The fallout last week was catastrophic for almost everyone involved. For many observers, the countess's decision was the worst she could possibly have made. She has revealed the most intimate - and, some think, undignified - details of her private life and that of Edward. Any other newspaper will in future be easily able to rake over details of the couple's marriage. The defence is all too predictable. Whether royal or not, they volunteered to put these issues in the public domain. In the meantime, she has also alienated the gaggle of royal reporters on Britain's other tabloid newspapers, who have been told for two years that there was 'categorically no possibility' of the countess giving them an interview.</p> <p>Sophie has herself become the story, disastrous for any PR. Instead of newspapers concentrating on her clients, their commentators are speculating that she will have to resign from her firm - she insists she will stay. Wade was reported to be 'almost distraught' on seeing that her paper had been scooped by a rival with its own story.</p> <p>And Murdoch is not pleased either. News International lawyers have been poring over their legal agreement with Sophie, trying desperately to see if they could still print transcripts of what Harkin said to them when she was not present. If Harkin promised 'coronets-for-cash', drugs or prostitutes to his new 'client' - all have been suggested - both his and Sophie's careers may be over. Even if he didn't, both their firm and the royal 'firm' have been made to seem dangerously damaged goods by the events of the past three weeks.</p> <p>Three days after the story broke, Edward was accused of cashing in on an official foreign trip last year to the Far East to solicit business for his TV production company. Commentators pored once again over his failure to make any mark in the profession of his choice.</p> <p>It is easy to understand why Downing Street has maintained almost complete silence over the debacle. 'There's simply no need for New Labour modernisers to campaign to down-size the monarchy,' said one Labour MP last night, 'when the royal family is doing so much itself to promote its own destruction.'</p> <p>\u0095 Additional research by Herpreet Grewal.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:ben.summerskill@observer.co.uk\">ben.summerskill@observer.co.uk</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.rjhpr.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">R-JH public relations</a><br><a href=\"http://members.tripod.com/~royalty12/\" target=\"_new\">Sophie Wessex fan site</a></p>",

For many observers, the countess's decision was the worst she could possibly have made. She has revealed the most intimate - and, some think, undignified - details of her private life and that of Edward. Any other newspaper will in future be easily able to rake over details of the couple's marriage. The defence is all too predictable. Whether royal or not, they volunteered to put these issues in the public domain. In the meantime, she has also alienated the gaggle of royal reporters on Britain's other tabloid newspapers, who have been told for two years that there was 'categorically no possibility' of the countess giving them an interview. Sophie has herself become the story, disastrous for any PR. Instead of newspapers concentrating on her clients, their commentators are speculating that she will have to resign from her firm - she insists she will stay. Wade was reported to be 'almost distraught' on seeing that her paper had been scooped by a rival with its own story. And Murdoch is not pleased either. News International lawyers have been poring over their legal agreement with Sophie, trying desperately to see if they could still print transcripts of what Harkin said to them when she was not present. If Harkin promised 'coronets-for-cash', drugs or prostitutes to his new 'client' - all have been suggested - both his and Sophie's careers may be over. Even if he didn't, both their firm and the royal 'firm' have been made to seem dangerously damaged goods by the events of the past three weeks. Three days after the story broke, Edward was accused of cashing in on an official foreign trip last year to the Far East to solicit business for his TV production company. Commentators pored once again over his failure to make any mark in the profession of his choice. It is easy to understand why Downing Street has maintained almost complete silence over the debacle. 'There's simply no need for New Labour modernisers to campaign to down-size the monarchy,' said one Labour MP last night, 'when the royal family is doing so much itself to promote its own destruction.' \u0095 Additional research by Herpreet Grewal. ben.summerskill@observer.co.uk Useful links R-JH public relations Sophie Wessex fan site",

He runs a successful business dependent upon his talents, but offers no favours or inside information. An heiress happens to have fallen in love with him, but that is a matter for her and him. Neither depends upon civil list cash, either directly or redirected through the Queen. The only young royals who would be constrained by the new arrangement would be the Waleses. But William and Harry could still join the diplomatic service or the voluntary sector if they do not fancy a traditional career in the armed forces. And if they end up working for Help the Aged or the Terrence Higgins Trust, their late mother would have approved too. Useful links R-JH public relations Sophie Wessex fan site",

      "bodyText": "David Trimble, Northern Ireland's First Minister, deliberately concealed a major policy shift on IRA arms from his party in order to get President Clinton to pressurise republicans on decommissioning. Trimble has admitted for the first time that he kept his decision to drop the Ulster Unionists' 'no guns, no government' stance from his party to give the IRA time to move on disarmament. The initiative appeared to work - two months later the IRA agreed to allow international arms inspectors to examine arms dumps and confirm these hides were not in use. Some of the UUP leader's closest allies were also kept in the dark about the St Patrick's Day 2000 peace initiative in Washington DC, according to a new edition of Trimble , by Henry McDonald, The Observer 's Ireland Editor. In the book Trimble admits that his move at Capitol Hill was partly an effort to combat Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams' influence on the White House. 'I knew Adams was going in to see Clinton and I wanted to put the ball at the President's feet. 'My aim was to show unionists were willing to move and that this would prompt Bill Clinton to pressurise republicans to start movement on the arms issue.' Trimble also accepts that the shift in policy - no participation in government with Sinn Fein until IRA arms were decommissioned - risked alienating his own party and the unionist electorate.

      "body": "<p>As a lifelong vegetarian, and self-styled animal rights activist (drunken 5am rants a speciality), I've noticed that people expect me to feel vindicated, even euphoric, about the foot-and-mouth crisis. Like, I'd enjoy nothing better than to romp off to the culling fields, to warm my hands on the burning pyres of cattle, or dance upon the mass graves of sheep. All the while, wailing biblically about judgment day being upon us, and how a hard meaty rain doth fall upon the unworthy and carnivorous. </p> <p>Truth is, I'm bewildered, by the images of mass-slaughter, but also by the farmers themselves. Open any paper and there they are, standing poignantly in empty barns, or staring out over desolate fields. We have been left in no doubt that the farmers have been devastated by the enforced cull. Grown men have been pictured weeping openly about the slaughter of 'their animals': animals which were healthy; animals which were part of their lives; animals which their children often knew by name. Daisy. Bluebell. Baa-Baa. Snowy. That's where I start feeling bewildered. Are Daisy, Bluebell, Baa-Baa and Snowy cats and dogs? Because if they were, one could understand the farmers' grief. However, if they were cows and sheep, it seems to me that they pretty much had it coming anyway. </p> <p>Am I the only person to notice how certain sectors of the media seem to be contriving to convince us that the 'devastated' farmers of Britain have been keeping cows and sheep, not for slaughter, not for meat, but as much loved pets? It seems to be being implied, that, at the very worst, the doomed animals were being kept for milk and wool. And then only respectfully and lovingly. You know, the kind of human- beast olde worlde friendly interaction that townies like to think goes on down yonder farm: 'Do you mind if I shear you, to make jerkins to keep out the winter cold, my black-faced friend?' ('Baaa!') Or: 'Could I bother you for a jug of milk for high tea, my gentle-eyed darling?' ('Moo!') When, in truth, throughout history, crisis or no crisis, the animal-farming industry has never remotely resembled the loved-up petting zoo of popular legend. </p> <p>Somehow, in the deluge of emotive dispatches from the frontline of foot and mouth, it seems to have been conveniently forgotten that the vast majority of these 'doomed' animals, especially the males, would have ended up being slaughtered anyway, probably within weeks. That's what happens to animals on farms - they are reared to die, because people want to eat them. This is not forgetting the lovely free holidays cattle and sheep are sent on. Where they are packed tightly in trucks, without food and water, to make exhausting journeys, for days on end, and - who knows? - maybe get to feel all continental and sophisticated as their throats are slit on foreign soil. </p> <p>This is pretty much the deal for Daisy and Baa-Baa in this country, so why all the amateur dramatics?

      "bodyText": "As a lifelong vegetarian, and self-styled animal rights activist (drunken 5am rants a speciality), I've noticed that people expect me to feel vindicated, even euphoric, about the foot-and-mouth crisis. Like, I'd enjoy nothing better than to romp off to the culling fields, to warm my hands on the burning pyres of cattle, or dance upon the mass graves of sheep. All the while, wailing biblically about judgment day being upon us, and how a hard meaty rain doth fall upon the unworthy and carnivorous. Truth is, I'm bewildered, by the images of mass-slaughter, but also by the farmers themselves. Open any paper and there they are, standing poignantly in empty barns, or staring out over desolate fields. We have been left in no doubt that the farmers have been devastated by the enforced cull. Grown men have been pictured weeping openly about the slaughter of 'their animals': animals which were healthy; animals which were part of their lives; animals which their children often knew by name. Daisy. Bluebell. Baa-Baa. Snowy. That's where I start feeling bewildered. Are Daisy, Bluebell, Baa-Baa and Snowy cats and dogs? Because if they were, one could understand the farmers' grief. However, if they were cows and sheep, it seems to me that they pretty much had it coming anyway. Am I the only person to notice how certain sectors of the media seem to be contriving to convince us that the 'devastated' farmers of Britain have been keeping cows and sheep, not for slaughter, not for meat, but as much loved pets? It seems to be being implied, that, at the very worst, the doomed animals were being kept for milk and wool. And then only respectfully and lovingly. You know, the kind of human- beast olde worlde friendly interaction that townies like to think goes on down yonder farm: 'Do you mind if I shear you, to make jerkins to keep out the winter cold, my black-faced friend?' ('Baaa!') Or: 'Could I bother you for a jug of milk for high tea, my gentle-eyed darling?' ('Moo!') When, in truth, throughout history, crisis or no crisis, the animal-farming industry has never remotely resembled the loved-up petting zoo of popular legend. Somehow, in the deluge of emotive dispatches from the frontline of foot and mouth, it seems to have been conveniently forgotten that the vast majority of these 'doomed' animals, especially the males, would have ended up being slaughtered anyway, probably within weeks. That's what happens to animals on farms - they are reared to die, because people want to eat them. This is not forgetting the lovely free holidays cattle and sheep are sent on. Where they are packed tightly in trucks, without food and water, to make exhausting journeys, for days on end, and - who knows? - maybe get to feel all continental and sophisticated as their throats are slit on foreign soil. This is pretty much the deal for Daisy and Baa-Baa in this country, so why all the amateur dramatics? It seems to me that the farmers aren't crying about 'their animals' at all, they are crying about their money. Fair enough. This is money the farmers have lost, money they're going to have to claw back in government compensation, money that was meant for their families, money that might not have been lost if it were not for bureaucratic incompetence. Much as I abhor standard farming practice in this country, and much as I hope this entire fiasco is accepted for what it is - a giant humanitarian wake-up call - these are all things worth crying about.

They always fret when the Prime Minister is tempted towards anything resembling preachy territory. As it turned out, his minders could relax. In reply to the Rector of Antrim, the Vicar of St Albion was faultlessly multi-denominational: 'I am sure that the nation will pray in its own way ...according to their faith.'</p> <p>It was the classic, ecumenical Blair response. Whether you be Anglican, Catholic, Hindu, Jehovah's Witness, Moonie, Mormon, Muslim, Presbyterian or Scientologist, whatever the flavour of your belief, you could not be offended by that. Even agnostics and atheists need not be upset. I am sure the non-judgmental Rev Blair is capable of explaining that non-belief can be considered a form of faith. As Dave Allen likes to sign off: 'May your God go with you.'</p> <p>The prime minister's personal religious beliefs may be so strong that he often carries a Bible in his case on trips abroad. But the public theology of Blairism is such a broad cathedral that it makes the Church of England sound dogmatic. The first commandment of the Prime Minister's faith is to cause the minimum of aggravation to the maximum number of people.</p> <p>It is a crude, but useful, device to divide politicians into warriors and heal ers. Lloyd George, Churchill and Thatcher were warriors; Baldwin, Attlee and Macmillan were healers. His spinners deceived many observers by projecting Mr Blair as the warrior type. To distinguish him from John Major and because New Labourites were enthralled by the dynamic properties of Margaret Thatcher, he has been presented as the Great Helmsman, the Strong Leader.</p> <p>Underneath the spin, his truer instinct is for consensus. Where Thatcher's edges were jagged, Blair's corners are sandpapered. Attempts to be warrior-like, such as his assault on the Forces of Conservatism, have rarely sounded authentic. Consider why the Prime Minister is so leery about taking on fox hunters. Not because he likes fox hunting. In Blair's perfect heaven, I expect it would be banned. But he is ever nervous of whipping up well-organised and vocal opposition. Sporadic assaults on privilege, usually inspired by the more tribally-minded Gordon Brown, have petered out. Blair fundamentally belongs to the healer class of Prime Minister.</p> <p>That has been made more evident by his decision to postpone the election. What really told with this occupant of Number 10 was his desire to sustain the image, in his own mind as much as that of the electorate, of a One Nation leader. You can be psychological about this and put it down to a craving within the Prime Minister to be loved. You can be cynical and say that he was swayed by the focus groups warning that it would cost him reputation and votes if he persisted with a May election. That can all be correct without detracting from the essential point. Mr Blair's basic instinct is to make himself the centre of gravity of the consensus.</p> <p>The decision has deeply irritated some people, but these were all people whom Mr Blair could be certain would vote Labour anyway. The Prime Minister overrode the vast majority of his senior colleagues, the bulk of Labour MPs and a party machine which was gagging to go in May. If Gordon Brown or John Prescott or Jack Straw or David Blunkett were the Prime Minister, the campaign would now be in full throttle. Passionately in the case of Prescott, calculatingly in the case of Brown, they argued with Blair to stick to the grid. An important reason why he is Prime Minister, and the above are not, is that Tony Blair has a better feel than any of his colleagues for the non-partisan mass of the country.</p> <p>It is not a huge shock that he spurned the imprecations of his colleagues. The Cabinet has always been a redundant item of furniture in this govern ment. More unusually, he took the decision in defiance of most of the press gang. A minority of commentators, of which I was one, came to the view that the election should be put back. The weight of the press clamoured for May with no delay. This is a Prime Minister frequently accused, often rightly, of being overly influenced by the media. He would always rather have the press on his side. But if there is a choice to be made between the media consensus and the people's consensus, then he will decide for the latter. He demonstrated a better understanding of the country than many of those who opine about it.</p> <p>One of Tony Blair's great talents is to sense and echo back the mood of the majority. And it already looks as if he was right and the agitators for May - internal and external - were wrong. Risks still attend on the June date. The so-called experts have been wrong before; they may not be right that the foot-and-mouth epidemic will soon be on the downward slope of the curve. But as things look this weekend, his decision was at once both the proper thing to do and the self-serving thing to do. He will emerge both as a bigger leader and with a bigger majority than had he gone for May. Just occasionally, politicians can have the best of both worlds.</p> <p>Tony Blair's feel for the centre of gravity has served him well over the first term and it has been the crucial underpinning of the Government's unprecedentedly long period of large popularity. The best example of his talent for consensus-building is the Good Friday Agreement. The worst things that have happened - a list might begin with the Dome of doom and the fuel blockades - came about when his touch deserted him or he ignored his initial instincts.</p> <p>The disadvantages and vulnerabilities of healer leaders have also been apparent. The innate aversion to conflict can too often translate into a failure to take decisions for fear of making an enemy. The Blair government has been better at talking about 'hard choices' than confronting them. Much agonising was lavished on when to call an election which he was going to win whatever. That tells us that this Prime Minister has not been tested with any genuinely cruel dilemmas.</p> <p>Maybe Mr Blair will be one of that happy, rare breed of leader who never has to bite on a really molar-cracking decision. History, however, suggests that the crunchy choices will arrive in his second term. If there is an economic downturn, who will suffer? Would this Prime Minister choose to raise taxes or cut spending? We cannot - yet - be sure. Will he try to fulfil his ambition to take Britain into the single currency even if it means conflicting with the great majority currently against joining the euro? No one is - yet - certain. Himself, I very much suspect, included. I mention only two of the more obvious dilemmas which will finally define Tony Blair.</p>",

But the public theology of Blairism is such a broad cathedral that it makes the Church of England sound dogmatic. The first commandment of the Prime Minister's faith is to cause the minimum of aggravation to the maximum number of people. It is a crude, but useful, device to divide politicians into warriors and heal ers. Lloyd George, Churchill and Thatcher were warriors; Baldwin, Attlee and Macmillan were healers. His spinners deceived many observers by projecting Mr Blair as the warrior type. To distinguish him from John Major and because New Labourites were enthralled by the dynamic properties of Margaret Thatcher, he has been presented as the Great Helmsman, the Strong Leader. Underneath the spin, his truer instinct is for consensus. Where Thatcher's edges were jagged, Blair's corners are sandpapered. Attempts to be warrior-like, such as his assault on the Forces of Conservatism, have rarely sounded authentic. Consider why the Prime Minister is so leery about taking on fox hunters. Not because he likes fox hunting. In Blair's perfect heaven, I expect it would be banned. But he is ever nervous of whipping up well-organised and vocal opposition. Sporadic assaults on privilege, usually inspired by the more tribally-minded Gordon Brown, have petered out. Blair fundamentally belongs to the healer class of Prime Minister. That has been made more evident by his decision to postpone the election. What really told with this occupant of Number 10 was his desire to sustain the image, in his own mind as much as that of the electorate, of a One Nation leader. You can be psychological about this and put it down to a craving within the Prime Minister to be loved. You can be cynical and say that he was swayed by the focus groups warning that it would cost him reputation and votes if he persisted with a May election. That can all be correct without detracting from the essential point. Mr Blair's basic instinct is to make himself the centre of gravity of the consensus. The decision has deeply irritated some people, but these were all people whom Mr Blair could be certain would vote Labour anyway. The Prime Minister overrode the vast majority of his senior colleagues, the bulk of Labour MPs and a party machine which was gagging to go in May. If Gordon Brown or John Prescott or Jack Straw or David Blunkett were the Prime Minister, the campaign would now be in full throttle. Passionately in the case of Prescott, calculatingly in the case of Brown, they argued with Blair to stick to the grid. An important reason why he is Prime Minister, and the above are not, is that Tony Blair has a better feel than any of his colleagues for the non-partisan mass of the country. It is not a huge shock that he spurned the imprecations of his colleagues. The Cabinet has always been a redundant item of furniture in this govern ment. More unusually, he took the decision in defiance of most of the press gang. A minority of commentators, of which I was one, came to the view that the election should be put back. The weight of the press clamoured for May with no delay. This is a Prime Minister frequently accused, often rightly, of being overly influenced by the media. He would always rather have the press on his side. But if there is a choice to be made between the media consensus and the people's consensus, then he will decide for the latter. He demonstrated a better understanding of the country than many of those who opine about it. One of Tony Blair's great talents is to sense and echo back the mood of the majority. And it already looks as if he was right and the agitators for May - internal and external - were wrong. Risks still attend on the June date. The so-called experts have been wrong before; they may not be right that the foot-and-mouth epidemic will soon be on the downward slope of the curve. But as things look this weekend, his decision was at once both the proper thing to do and the self-serving thing to do. He will emerge both as a bigger leader and with a bigger majority than had he gone for May. Just occasionally, politicians can have the best of both worlds. Tony Blair's feel for the centre of gravity has served him well over the first term and it has been the crucial underpinning of the Government's unprecedentedly long period of large popularity. The best example of his talent for consensus-building is the Good Friday Agreement. The worst things that have happened - a list might begin with the Dome of doom and the fuel blockades - came about when his touch deserted him or he ignored his initial instincts. The disadvantages and vulnerabilities of healer leaders have also been apparent. The innate aversion to conflict can too often translate into a failure to take decisions for fear of making an enemy. The Blair government has been better at talking about 'hard choices' than confronting them. Much agonising was lavished on when to call an election which he was going to win whatever. That tells us that this Prime Minister has not been tested with any genuinely cruel dilemmas. Maybe Mr Blair will be one of that happy, rare breed of leader who never has to bite on a really molar-cracking decision. History, however, suggests that the crunchy choices will arrive in his second term. If there is an economic downturn, who will suffer? Would this Prime Minister choose to raise taxes or cut spending? We cannot - yet - be sure. Will he try to fulfil his ambition to take Britain into the single currency even if it means conflicting with the great majority currently against joining the euro? No one is - yet - certain. Himself, I very much suspect, included. I mention only two of the more obvious dilemmas which will finally define Tony Blair.",

      "body": "<p>Given the option of winning the FA Cup or Champions League, your average footballer's answer these days is so predictable it's not a question worth asking. Conversation with Sylvain Wiltord, a man who instinctively veers away from convention, hadn't gone anywhere near that seemingly pointless poser when he spontaneously admitted he'd prefer the faded old darling of English football to European eminence. </p> <p>Why? Simple, really. He has felt part of Arsenal's FA Cup campaign and peripheral in Europe.</p> <p>'I've hardly played in the Champions League,' he laments. 'If we win the Champions League it wouldn't mean so much to me and I'd feel a bit bitter because I like to participate. I like to give everything.' If that sounds outrageously selfish he doesn't mean it that way. His logic evolves from a childlike love for playing football. In the FA Cup he has been involved, changed games, outsmarted adversaries, scored in every round, savoured his celebrations, and generally done what he is best at.</p> <p>His choice might also have something to do with his forthright assessment on whether Arsenal can actually win the Champions League. 'Frankly, no. It's too hard,' he remarks. 'But never say never.' Arsenal's French livewire, as a footballer and as a man, is compellingly audacious. That is one of the reasons Arsene Wenger signed him in the first place for a club record pounds 13 million. The manager wanted to enhance his squad not just with a goalscorer, but also a personality - the sort of hyperactive individuality that disappeared when Ian Wright departed. He rather likes the comparison with the much-loved rogue of Arsenal's recent past, interrupting to sing: 'Yes! Me, I love to be alive. I love to have fun in the dressing room and have a laugh with everybody. But I also like to give a performance on the pitch.'</p> <p>Legs twitching, mischievous eyes darting all over the place, fiddling with whatever is in touching distance, he is like Zebedee, constantly on the verge of springing off on some tangent. He had a plane to catch but hey, once his tongue was wagging and he was rapping merrily away, that could wait.</p> <p>You can imagine Wiltord's single-minded spontaneity makes him hot to handle but also as confident as they come. No inferiority complex about competing with the Bergkamps and Kanus for a spot alongside Thierry Henry.</p> <p>The fact that nobody - perhaps not even Wenger himself - knows the composition of Arsenal's strongest attack has had a stifling effect on all of his forwards at some point or another this season. Wiltord is not a happy rotatee. 'I find this situation really hard. I talk to the boss very often - sometimes it is a bit tense between us - because I don't understand why. Sometimes it works well with a partnership and the next game he chooses other forwards. We really don't understand.</p> <p>'As a player you want to experience pleasure, feel the ball, run around, go for goal, you know? I'm used to playing more than 50 games a year, as I have done for the past seven years in France. I'm used to that rhythm. When you are in and out it's hard to make progress. In France I always said I'm not a No 9 striker. I like prowling. I like to run all over the pitch and if I find myself in a goalscoring position I go for it.</p> <p>'My game is all about stamina, tenacity, outfoxing your opponent, and when you don't have enough playing time it's difficult to do that on a regular basis. You haven't seen the real Sylvain Wiltord. You see the real me over a season.' He was tempted to leave in January for Paris Saint-Germain. Having made such an effort to get to Highbury in the first place (by going awol from Bordeaux and outlining his demands publicly he made enough of a nuisance of himself to force the transfer) he felt stymied by lack of action. A son of the hip hop Parisian suburbs, he gave a return to his roots serious thought. Ultimately he turned it down because he would have felt 'a bit of a failure' after only a few months of his foreign adventure. So he knuckled down. Famously a rebel in his youth - a lingering trait, judging by the fact that Wenger had to admonish him after partying until the early hours before a game - he is getting better at controlling his emotions. February served up the truest test of his resolve when kicking his heels on the bench in the Champions League win at Lyon, in front of all his family, hurt deeply. But he coped, and was rewarded in March with a hat-trick against West Ham which, according to Thierry Henry, confirmed his 'complete integration'.</p> <p>Now here we are in April on the verge of the FA Cup semi-final derby, the kind of hot match he adores. If he continues his scoring streak in the competition the critics will have to pay him the respect he feels he merits. He scored 22 goals in 33 games when Bordeaux won the league in 1999, and his strike rate here in a season of adaptation is a fraction under a goal every two starts.</p> <p>In England we don't realise the extent to which he is valued in France. Much of that, of course, stems from his injury-time equaliser in the Euro 2000 final, paving the way for his country's triumph. 'It's written on your achievements: champion of Europe Sylvain Wiltord,' he says. 'It's magnifique .' That propelled him from being a successful footballer to a national icon. Living abroad means he can still live normally. The attention he gets back home, because of that goal, he says, would have been 'too much'.</p> <p>Wiltord enjoys life in London. 'Super!' he drools. 'The fans respect you and give you freedom to have a private life. I feel good here. The language is all right - the problem is there are too many French people! There are no clans, but there is one thing: when we eat there is a French table and an English table. But we all have a great time - the atmosphere within the team is fantastic.'</p> <p>Wenger is pleased with his progress. 'Wiltord, apart from the first three months, has always been on the way up,' he notes. Wenger is increasingly tempted to develop the side with a front three that has served him well recently. 'The offensive balance is quite good with Wiltord, Kanu and Henry in the last two games but that is not enough to say it is proven. Are we good enough defensively to start the game like that? I don't know. Maybe I should try it one day.' This afternoon perhaps?

Afterwards, winning jockey Richard Guest said: 'I've won the Martell Grand National and now I am hoping for the Gold Cup.' If it rains from now to next March he might have a chance. Still mud-spattered, he sat in front of the TV to watch the race again. 'I must have stood on ten horses there; that [the Chair] was the only fence he jumped properly.' A trainer's wife approached to convey her husband's congratulations. 'I'm surprised he said that because he sacked me,' said Guest.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>I was working up a nice head of steam to hate Gary Lineker when I went to interview him. 10 o'clock Monday morning at Sunningdale Golf Club, so a two-hour slog round the M25 muttering 'All very well for him' - his house abuts Sunningdale golf course. There was also a mounting fear that he might expect me to show some faint knowledge of, or interest in, golf.</p> <p>My editor had tried to enthuse me with tales of Lineker's vast intelligence but I never bought the idea that just because he is reasonably articulate, he is some kind of Wittgenstein of sport. I was not encouraged by a cutting I found in a four-year-old Daily Express in which he blithely confessed that he never bought CDs, rarely watched television, no longer read books except to his sons at bedtime, and given the choice of dinner with Jane Austen, Joan Collins or Virginia Woolf would turn them all down on the grounds that, 'They're all wrinkly, aren't they?'</p> <p>But then - this is the thing with Lineker - he is always a bit better than you expect. True, he made me drive out to Sunningdale, but he was punctual to the minute and apparently happy to sit and chat in the clubhouse without whingeing on about how he might have been out playing golf. Plus, he is a pleasure to look at with his smooth hairless skin and chocolate eyes. He doesn't have those horrible canoe-shaped thighs that most footballers have. And, he is bright and has a nice laconic sense of humour. He used to write a football column for The Observer and everyone was amazed at the time that he wrote it all himself - most celebrity sports columns are ghosted - but he obviously took a lot of trouble to get it right . . .</p> <p>These are the themes of his life - hard work, diligence, always performing a bit better than anyone expected. And of course being good, almost saintly - never shown a yellow card in l6 years of professional football, happily married to his childhood sweetheart Michelle, utterly devoted to his four sons, the first of whom, George, almost died of leukaemia but is now fine. One cannot hate such a paragon - one might perhaps be a tiny bit bored by him.</p> <p>He claims to be fed up with his whiter-than-white image, but he can't really help it. Witness his shock when I ask if he ever cheats at golf. (I would have thought that in golf as in croquet a mastery of discreet footwork was one of the sine qua nons, but apparently not.) 'Oh nonono!' he cries, practically fainting with horror; he would never cheat. 'The thing with golf is it's really you against the golf course so ultimately you're only cheating yourself.' He plays two or three times a week and is down to a five handicap but thinks that's about as good as he'll get because 'You can tell if you've got natural ability. Even starting at 33, 34 as I did, you'd be down to scratch by now if you were a real natural player.'</p> <p>His life now sounds an idyllic mix of work and play. He has 'the Saturday job' - presenting Match of the Day, though not for much longer - he has a well-paid contract advertising Walkers crisps, he is a team captain on They Think It's All Over (a new series starts this month), he does a lot of charity work for leukaemia research, he plays golf, he goes jogging with his wife Michelle, and he spends a great deal of time with his four young sons. He is well-off - not fabulously so, but he probably saved a few million from his football career and is reportedly on \u00a3500,000 a year from the BBC. His life is just about as comfortable as anyone's could ever be. And he knows it, he talks often about his luck - his luck in having a talent for football that enabled him to rise from being a Leicester greengrocer's son, and then a talent for television which seems to a guarantee a high-earning middle age. Plus, he never forgets to add, the greatest luck of all in meeting Michelle, his perfect wife.</p> <p>But now ill luck has fallen - Match of the Day is soon to be no more. The blow fell last June when his producer told him, almost in tears, that ITV had outbid the BBC and the programme would finish in 2001. We are now into the dying days of a national institution. Lineker was so devastated when he heard that he could barely speak, but he has now rallied. 'It was a blow - no doubt about that - but on the bright side, since then we've bought back the rights to show the FA Cup and I think at the moment that looks like a more interesting competition, perhaps even than the Premier League, because of Manchester United's dominance.</p> <p>'And we've also got the rights to show England games live for the first time on terrestrial television next season. So what we will have will be less frequent but much bigger events. I mean I've always tried to take the positive from everything, so even though it's a massive blow - at least I'll get my weekends back!'</p> <p>He looks forward to playing football with his sons in the back garden - but only in trainers, because he doesn't even own any football boots now. He seemed to bow out of football almost without regret at the age of 33. After a glorious career, scoring 48 goals for England, he took a very highly paid two-year contract in Japan but suffered a recurrent toe injury and barely played there. It sounds as though he had mentally signed off perhaps even before he went to Japan, so why did he go? 'First, it was a chance to earn the sort of money that players are earning now - which stopped me being a bitter and twisted old pro. [He says he 'can't remember' how much he was paid but the papers reported \u00a33m.] And second, it came at the right time, when my pace and things were beginning to diminish.'</p> <p>By the time he came back to England, 'I'd had enough really, I was ready to move on to other things. I mean I loved playing, especially the big occasions, but there comes a time when you think it would be nice to do something else. You get to your thirties and you still get managers screaming at you. And you start aching in the mornings after games and you realise as well that you perhaps can't do it quite as well as you used to. So I found it quite easy to leave. But I think that was probably helped to a degree in that I was injured and I spent the last two years pretty much convalescing and doing rehabilitation training which is tedious in the extreme. I was at the stage where I wanted to do something else, I knew what I wanted to do and I just wanted to get doing it.'</p> <p>He had already decided, long before, that he had no desire to be a football manager - most of them, he observed, 'seem to be either on the brink of madness or deep depression'. According to his team-mates he had his sights set on being 'Des Lynam junior' right back in 1990. So when he returned to England he and his long-time agent Jon Holmes plotted it out very carefully - how he would 'position himself' as the upmarket football commentator. </p> <p>He wrote a column for The Observer and did a programme on Radio Five Live and took vocal training to try and enliven his rather flat voice. He grabbed the opportunity to do They Think It's All Over because it was fun but also because it gave him 'a bit of edge when perhaps you were perceived as not having one'. And he has become quite good, he says, at 'pretending to be embarrassed' while the others make filthy remarks.</p> <p>But most important of all he appeared as a pundit on Grandstand and Match of the Day, and used that time to learn everything he could from Des Lynam. Mostly he learned by watching, but Lynam also gave him some hints. 'Like in the early days I used to fluff a lot of lines and get quite tense about that, and he said, \"Well we all do it - I do it. The important thing is, rather like when you're playing golf, when you're struggling it's better to slow down rather than quicken up.\"</p> <p>'So that helped significantly. And one of the things about Des is he'll never say \"Joining me\", he'll say \"Joining us\", basically including the people at home. Things like that he's advised me. And then - prepare your ad libs! It appears sometimes that you say things off the cuff but you've been thinking about them for some time.'</p> <p>Then, in the summer of 1999, Lynam announced his defection to ITV. While the nation mourned, Lineker whooped with joy - he'd been described for some time as Lynam's heir apparent, but he couldn't ever have expected that his succession would come so quickly. He finds it embarrassing now that the tabloids try to present him and Lynam as rivals - 'I still consider him to be the master - even to be compared with him is the biggest compliment that anyone could ever pay me. It's probably much more irritating for him - who is this little pipsqueak, silly old footballer who is still learning the trade?'</p> <p>Actually, when I asked Lynam his views on Lineker he said nothing about pipsqueaks. On the contrary he said: 'I think he's excellent now. It was difficult for him coming in because he was already a superstar and maybe some people were waiting for him to fall on his backside. But he got to a very high standard very quickly. I can tell when he's taking talkback but it doesn't seem to trouble him - his mind is like an iceberg. He's a very nice guy. . . I hate him really!'</p> <p>Anyway Lineker is now thoroughly at home in television. He even says he enjoys it more than playing football - he likes having women around, and 'better educated' people to talk to. But he says he was shocked at the beginning by all the back-biting and bitchery, and the general insecurity of television people. 'They seem to be far more vulnerable. If there's a hint of any criticism from a newspaper or something, everybody reacts as if it's the end of the world - it's bizarre. And you think, that's nothing. But it's only because they're not used to it, they get so little of it. Whereas in football, you get used to so much criticism that you know how to handle it - basically you ignore it. So that's a big difference and I think perhaps because of that they're not so self-assured as footballers are. Maybe it's more like how it is in the rest of life, in the real world - because football is not the real world, you're like a little kid, you're still doing what you want to do and you're not so dependent on public opinion.'</p> <p>Lineker seems almost too calm, collected, sensible ever to have been a footballer - his enemies can interpret it as being a possibly a bit calculating, possibly a bit selfish, possibly a bit cold. His belief that football was 'only a game' must have seemed like treachery to the besotted fans - how could anyone be so passionless? And even his team-mates - he speaks with amazement about how some of them would be so nervous before a match they'd be throwing up or walking round the dressing room kicking doors or head-butting the walls. 'I've seen some bizarre sights, the things people do to motivate themselves and get themselves going - all to conquer the fear side of things. And there is a lot of fear in football - the pressure of performing in front of twenty, thirty, forty, fifty thousand people. </p> <p>'I mean if you ever, as a player in an England squad, really considered how much you matter to people back home, you'd be too terrified to put one leg in front of the other. You don't tend to do that because you're cocooned in this environment of togetherness that protects you. But having now experienced World Cups from the other side, I think crikey! People really care too much. It affects people's lives too much. I mean look at Beckham's thing against Argentina and the ridiculously over-the-top response to that. Or Phil Neville's foul in the last minute against Romania and then the vitriol that is poured over them. And you think, crikey should it really matter that much? Of course it shouldn't. But it seems to.'</p> <p>It is easy to explain Lineker's phlegmatic attitude by saying that after his first child, George, almost died of leukaemia, everything else must seem trivial. But he says no, he had the same attitude before, he was always easy-going. That's why he never got a booking, why he never argued with referees - what was the point of arguing, he felt, when there was no chance they'd ever turn round and say 'Oh yes, you've convinced me, I've made a mistake.' But didn't he, doesn't he, ever, just once in his life want to throw a big starry tantrum and scream his head off? 'No! I'd be too embarrassed by my own behaviour - I just think that would be the worst thing in the world. We all want to be liked.'</p> <p>Do we? I don't know that everyone wants to be liked as much as Lineker seems to. I was preparing to argue the toss when an elderly man in a blazer came and stood by the bar and looked at Lineker and then stared very pointedly at the photographer's tripod which had been left on the bar. It was the club secretary having what I suppose in golf circles counts as a hissy fit - you would have thought the tripod was a giant dildo with knobs on from the apoplectic way he boggled at it. Lineker seemed a bit slow on the uptake, though eventually he made a sort of grudging apology - 'I didn't know there was a photographer coming. I'd have called you about it if I'd known.' But I'm not sure it was quite enough to appease the wrath of the club secretary.</p> <p>This seems a good moment to raise my own beef - how dare he describe Jane Austen and Virginia Woolf as wrinklies? He flatly denies he ever said it: 'It's nonsense. I never heard that one before in my life! Someone's made that one up.' If I were feeling sadistic I might ask him to name all the novels of Jane Austen or Virginia Woolf but I can't be bothered - he's a nice guy, not an intellectual, but then he never claimed to be. I just hope he makes his peace with the club secretary. </p> <p><strong>Lineker on...</strong></p> <p><strong>... Eriksson</strong> <br> 'He seems a very nice chap. I've interviewed him and you've got more chance of getting blood out of a stone than anything out of him.

      "bodyText": "I was working up a nice head of steam to hate Gary Lineker when I went to interview him. 10 o'clock Monday morning at Sunningdale Golf Club, so a two-hour slog round the M25 muttering 'All very well for him' - his house abuts Sunningdale golf course. There was also a mounting fear that he might expect me to show some faint knowledge of, or interest in, golf. My editor had tried to enthuse me with tales of Lineker's vast intelligence but I never bought the idea that just because he is reasonably articulate, he is some kind of Wittgenstein of sport. I was not encouraged by a cutting I found in a four-year-old Daily Express in which he blithely confessed that he never bought CDs, rarely watched television, no longer read books except to his sons at bedtime, and given the choice of dinner with Jane Austen, Joan Collins or Virginia Woolf would turn them all down on the grounds that, 'They're all wrinkly, aren't they?' But then - this is the thing with Lineker - he is always a bit better than you expect. True, he made me drive out to Sunningdale, but he was punctual to the minute and apparently happy to sit and chat in the clubhouse without whingeing on about how he might have been out playing golf. Plus, he is a pleasure to look at with his smooth hairless skin and chocolate eyes. He doesn't have those horrible canoe-shaped thighs that most footballers have. And, he is bright and has a nice laconic sense of humour. He used to write a football column for The Observer and everyone was amazed at the time that he wrote it all himself - most celebrity sports columns are ghosted - but he obviously took a lot of trouble to get it right . . . These are the themes of his life - hard work, diligence, always performing a bit better than anyone expected. And of course being good, almost saintly - never shown a yellow card in l6 years of professional football, happily married to his childhood sweetheart Michelle, utterly devoted to his four sons, the first of whom, George, almost died of leukaemia but is now fine. One cannot hate such a paragon - one might perhaps be a tiny bit bored by him. He claims to be fed up with his whiter-than-white image, but he can't really help it. Witness his shock when I ask if he ever cheats at golf. (I would have thought that in golf as in croquet a mastery of discreet footwork was one of the sine qua nons, but apparently not.) 'Oh nonono!' he cries, practically fainting with horror; he would never cheat. 'The thing with golf is it's really you against the golf course so ultimately you're only cheating yourself.' He plays two or three times a week and is down to a five handicap but thinks that's about as good as he'll get because 'You can tell if you've got natural ability. Even starting at 33, 34 as I did, you'd be down to scratch by now if you were a real natural player.' His life now sounds an idyllic mix of work and play. He has 'the Saturday job' - presenting Match of the Day, though not for much longer - he has a well-paid contract advertising Walkers crisps, he is a team captain on They Think It's All Over (a new series starts this month), he does a lot of charity work for leukaemia research, he plays golf, he goes jogging with his wife Michelle, and he spends a great deal of time with his four young sons. He is well-off - not fabulously so, but he probably saved a few million from his football career and is reportedly on \u00a3500,000 a year from the BBC. His life is just about as comfortable as anyone's could ever be. And he knows it, he talks often about his luck - his luck in having a talent for football that enabled him to rise from being a Leicester greengrocer's son, and then a talent for television which seems to a guarantee a high-earning middle age. Plus, he never forgets to add, the greatest luck of all in meeting Michelle, his perfect wife. But now ill luck has fallen - Match of the Day is soon to be no more. The blow fell last June when his producer told him, almost in tears, that ITV had outbid the BBC and the programme would finish in 2001. We are now into the dying days of a national institution. Lineker was so devastated when he heard that he could barely speak, but he has now rallied.

      "body": "<p>Paul Merton used to have a joke that went: 'The first Tube station to be built in London was Baker Street in 1862.' Then, deadpan, after an impeccable pause: 'Well, what was the point of that? Where would you go?'</p> <p>When Fulham FC announced last June that, as of this season, their women's team was to become the first fully professional women's side in the UK, the response was very similar. 'The first thing people always ask is \"Who do you play?\"' says general manager Gary Mulcahey, 'as if we're suddenly stuck in this league on our own with no one to compete against.'</p> <p>The answer is that they still compete - in the loosest sense of the word - against the amateur women's teams which, in terms of league football at least, presents a painfully farcical spectacle. Standing on the touchline at Motspur Park, New Malden, on a damp February Sunday, I watch the pitiful sight of the Stowmarket team traipsing off the pitch after a humiliating 19-1 defeat at the feet of Mohammed Al-Fayed's girls. Exhausted, red-faced and dejected, half of them are pulling cigarette packets from the pockets of their shorts and lighting up before they even get to the bar; meanwhile the Fulham girls, lean and barely sweating, are racing upstairs to analyse the game over their stipulated ration of pasta and bottled water before an early night. After all, they're training at 10 the following morning.</p> <p>It could hardly be described as a sporting match; the Fulham side, fielding four internationals, play a smooth passing game and have barely let the ball cross into their own half (the one goal conceded was a silly defensive mistake, presumably due to the fact that the back four and goalkeeper Layla Young had forgotten what the ball looked like). Stowmarket, by contrast, look like a school team: disorganised, depressed and bewildered, they appeared to have psychologically abandoned the match even before kick-off. This has been the case with most of the league games this season; Fulham have a lead of Man United proportions, and boast seven of the division's 10 top scorers. It's like pitching Fergie's boys against your dad's Sunday League team; don't they ever get bored by the ritual slaughter?</p> <p>'Not with Stowmarket!' says defender Ronnie Gibbons, 21, indignantly. Ronnie is one of the team's pin-ups, with her own cabal of groupies; petite and blonde, with a pretty, pixie face, she also plays for the Republic of Ireland and appears quite incensed with Stowmarket. 'They're second in the league, yeah? And the last time we played them we won like 6-0, and they sent us this email saying, for a professional side you're not all that, you know, you're not organised and whatever. So we thought we'd show them this time. It's like, so we're not that good, then? It helps if you have a reason like that to really beat them.' </p> <p>Fayed had the idea of turning his club's women's team professional after a visit to the US some 18 months ago. They were then in the South East Combination League, the third division, and they are still in that division this season, their first as professionals. The resulting gulf in class has seen a succession of results of Stowmarket dimensions, and though their league games this season have been tedious for all concerned - particularly the trail of crushed opponents left in their wake - it is, as their manager Frank McMorrow points out, surely better than being able simply to buy their way into the Premier League. </p> <p>By the time they reach the Premier, however, as they look certain to do by 2003, the face of women's football in this country may have changed entirely. By then the women's game, or at least the *lite part of it, may have gone professional. The FA have already conducted research into the possibility, though it is concerned that a professional league should be carefully regulated so that the women's game doesn't fall victim to rampant commercialism. </p> <p>'It must be in the interests of the whole game,' explains Katherine Knight, women's football press officer for the FA. 'Unless all the teams can turn professional with the same support it won't work. What we don't want is a situation where two or three clubs have the money to spend on the best players and the others suffer. It's no good for anyone if teams like Fulham go through the season beating everyone else 12-0.'</p> <p>Given that the concept of professional women footballers is uncharted territory for everyone concerned - including the footballers' union, the PFA, which has granted the Fulham Ladies the same union rights as male players, and the FA itself, which has been obliged to draw up new contracts that include full maternity rights (two of the Fulham players are mothers) - it's not surprising that everyone within the game is keeping a close eye on Fulham Ladies in their first professional season.</p> <p>'For me, this is like a dream come true,' says Permi Jhooti, 30, who signed from Chelsea two years ago. Permi is gamine and articulate, and is the first British-born footballer, male or female, to have been called up to play for the Indian national side. She is also unique among the team in having had a separate working life that ran parallel to her football: when not training, she is busy writing up her PhD thesis in computer science at Imperial College, and has previously set up her own internet business. </p> <p>'I'm hoping to be able to play for at least another five years,' she says, though she is just getting over a serious injury that has kept her out of the side. 'I do have an alternative career, but I'll be doing that for the rest of my life, so this is a chance to indulge my love of football. It's a one-off chance - you couldn't turn it down, could you?'</p> <p>She began playing football at junior school in Preston, where she was able to join in with boys' teams, but once in her teens she found opportunities for girls' football almost non-existent, and only took the game up again seriously at university. </p> <p>While many of the younger, London-born girls benefited from newer centres of football training and youth teams specifically for girls, they agree that they felt the absence of prominent female role models in the sport. 'When we were younger it was really hard because there were no women footballers to look up to,' says 21-year-old Rachel Yankey. 'It was definitely seen as a boys' game, the only well-known players you could have as role models were men, so part of what we're doing is trying to change that, and raise the profile so that young girls who want to play football don't see it as a men's sport.'</p> <p>Certainly, none of them imagined they would one day be paid for playing football. Quite how much they are being paid, however, is shrouded in mystery. The players are under strict instruction not to divulge their salaries to anyone, least of all the media - largely to avoid ill feeling within the team, since the salaries are graded according to age and experience. The official line is that the girls earn 'a good salary' for their age, which educated guesses in the football world put at around \u00a316-18,000 for the younger players, though the Norwegians Marianne Pettersen and Margunn Haugenes (both gold medallists at the Sydney Olympics) will certainly be on a lot more. Pettersen turned down an offer to play in the decidedly more glamorous WUSA to join her team-mate at Fulham this season, and Margunn has also brought her young daughter and her husband, Gaute, who is now assistant manager. The rumour is they could be earning up to \u00a31,000 per week. </p> <p>Part of Fulham's long-term plan for the Ladies is to nurture home-grown talent and build a relationship with the local community, which involves a commitment to regular coaching sessions at schools. The theory is that, as well as the obvious encouragement to young girls to take an interest in the game, these sessions will also eventually prove a fertile ground for recruiting supporters and for spotting talented young players who might then be referred to Fulham's FA sponsored Centre of Excellence for girls.</p> <p>The reality is less glamorous than it might sound. On a dank Monday afternoon, as night falls at half past three, I join Rachel Yankey in the gym of a shabby comprehensive in Fulham to watch a straggle of girls kick a ball at a bench with varying levels of enthusiasm. From where I'm sitting, it seems impossible to judge in this confined space whether there's any nascent talent in the group (though the two who break to text message their friends between each shot are perhaps lacking the necessary determination), but Rachel is convinced that there are one or two promising players, and enough potential to put together a six-a-side team for the London Youth Tournament in the summer.</p> <p>'It's really good for the girls to be coached by Rachel because they can relate to her,' says Clinton Joseph, Hammersmith and Fulham Council's youth sport coordinator, who set up this particular session. 'You know - she's a London girl, they can see her as a big sister. But in terms of being a role model, I don't think they make the connection because women's football gets so little publicity. They know she plays for England but they have no idea she's the David Beckham of the women's game - to them she's just Rachel. We're trying to organise a trip to watch her play for England because that will give the girls a better idea of where they could go with the game.'</p> <p>Rachel offers a diffident shrug as she packs her balls into her car in the rain. 'It's a really good part of the job,' she says. 'I like teaching them, I get a lot out of it. I've coached boys too, and they can be really cocky, like \"what are you doing telling us how to play?\" But once they see you can kick a ball you get respect.'</p> <p>Surprisingly, the girls have few stories to offer of facing down male prejudice about their sport because they appear not to have encountered it in any significant form. 'A lot of the time when you meet blokes and tell them you're a professional footballer they don't believe you,' Chantelle White, 17, explains. 'But some of the men's team supporters have been to watch us play the cup games and they're all really surprised at how good we are.' She obviously hasn't encountered the middle-aged man who sat behind me during one match shouting persistent would-be funny comments - 'Swap shirts now, darlin'!' or, when play stopped for injury, 'What's up, ref - has she laddered her stockings?' But it was encouraging to see that, judging by the unamused responses of the men around him, this kind of attitude is gradually being eroded.</p> <p>I meet the team for dinner in a small and friendly Italian restaurant not far from the training ground in New Malden, and we've more or less taken it over, apart from one table of besuited older diners who frown disapprovingly in our direction from time to time as the girls get increasingly giggly and loud. Observers not privy to the conversation would never identify them as a football team; they're attractive girls, slim and fit, and far from the butch stereotypes that the label 'women footballers' conjures up. While discipline is tight on the pitch, once they're in civvies it's much easier to spot the characters in the team.</p> <p>On a separate table, away from manager Frank McMorrow and Gary Mulcahey, the younger players - Rachel, Chantelle, Ronnie, Rachel 'Macca' McArthur (23) and Kim Jerray-Silver (23) are soon shrieking with laughter, delighted that they've been allowed a glass of wine and for once don't have to eat pasta. Permi is on the same table but noticeably more restrained, and it's here that the wide age range of the players is more apparent. 'We have team meals together twice a week, but we do go out socially when it's people's birthdays and stuff,' says Ronnie. 'Everyone gets on really well, which is amazing considering the amount of time we spend with each other.'</p> <p>So what do they do when they're not playing football?</p> <p>'Sleep!' they chorus. 'My friends don't really get it when I say I'm tired at the end of the day, because they're all doing jobs in offices or whatever,' says Chantelle. 'But it is a really tiring training routine, so we don't really go out that much.'</p> <p>'I sometimes miss being able to go out clubbing with my friends,' says Ronnie, 'but we have a 48-hour drink ban before games, and the rest of the time you don't really want to drink anyway because you feel it the next day in training. But I don't really mind - obviously you have to give things up if you want to play your sport well.'</p> <p>There's a youthful boisterousness, but none of the swaggering aggression often associated with male players; on and off the pitch, women players are just better behaved. The girls are clearly confident - unsurprisingly, after the season they've had - but there's a striking absence of arrogance. There's no predicting the side effects of money and fame, of course, but looking around the table, it's hard to imagine any of these players starting fights in nightclubs, beating up their partners in public or battling cocaine habits across the tabloids.</p> <p>'No, fortunately we haven't had to deal with that side of it yet,' says McMorrow, with a wry grin. He's told the girls they can have one glass of wine with their meal and no one's arguing. Frank is genial, if taciturn, but the presentation of the team - especially where the media is concerned - is strictly policed. Trying to draw the girls out, sotto voce, on the matter of their salaries when Frank's back is turned proves impossible; they all toe the party line and clam up altogether. 'It's good,' they say, shuffling and looking cornered.</p> <p>How good? </p> <p>'Pretty good. You know.'</p> <p>Come on - in the region of?</p> <p>'It's just good, okay? I mean, we're getting paid to play football.'</p> <p>The talk over dinner touches occasionally on boyfriends, clothes and reminiscences about fleeting encounters with 'The Chairman' - never once referred to by name in my hearing but always as 'The Chairman', which conjures a nicely sinister air.</p> <p>'We had to go to this lunch at Harrods at Christmas and he asked what we wanted to drink, so we said champagne \u00dc'</p> <p>' - and we had to wear ball-gowns \u00dc'</p> <p>' - there was this other time when he came to a training session and had a kick around \u00dc'</p> <p>' - Jody had to pretend to let a goal in \u00dc'</p> <p>' - yeah, except I couldn't because he kicked it right at me. What was I supposed to do?'</p> <p>But the banter always comes back to what's uppermost in everyone's mind - winning the FA Cup, the team's Grail this season. The final will be televised live on Sky, and an FA Cup victory over Arsenal will put Fulham firmly on the map.</p> <p>'We're looking at the possibility of going over to play the US teams,' says Mulcahey, 'but it will really help us if we're able to approach them as the UK cup winners. It'll also help us get sponsorship, and then there are the Uefa women's championships starting this year - the FA are only allowed to send one team from the UK and it would help our case if we had the title under our belts.'</p> <p>The girls are jostling noisily into position for a group photograph when a tall, silver-haired man from the frowning table approaches.</p> <p>'So do I gather you're a football team?' he asks, smoothly.</p> <p>The girls bellow their confirmation.</p> <p>'I'm the vice-president of Chelsea,' he announces, and Rachel McArthur, without missing a beat, says: 'Ah. Take a seat.'</p> <p>And suddenly they're launched into a high-octane charm offensive, talking over each other, impressing their credentials, shouting about their cup prospects. Frank smiles with paternal indulgence but keeps a watchful eye on the proceedings. Not that he's in any danger of having his players poached at the moment, but in a few years, it's not impossible that top rank players such as Rachel or Katie might be attracting agents and big money. </p> <p>Two weeks later, Rachel's knee injury is improved sufficiently for her to play half the FA Cup semi-final against Southampton Saints in front of a crowd of about 1,500. As the girls predicted at dinner, they can indeed 'have Southampton, easy'; Sanchia Duncan scores in the first minute thanks to a pitiful mistake by the Saints keeper. Southampton's error is compounded by an own goal shortly afterwards and it's a comfortable 5-0 within 35 minutes. Saints replace their poor, humiliated keeper in the second half and opt for damage limitation by putting all their players practically in the box, but Fulham have lost their initial aggression and taken the pressure off; combined with some strategic defending, this results in several missed opportunities that could have taken Fulham's score to double figures. </p> <p>May's final at Selhurst Park, the predicted London derby against Arsenal, who beat Bristol Rovers to book their place - won't be such an easy ride, and they'll have to face the prejudice of the fans too, the prickly sense of resentment I noticed in the stands for the first time. Fulham are seen as the heavily advantaged rich kids indulged with a big man's millions; beside me, a handful of Southampton fans sang, with bitter sarcasm, 'We've all got loads of money' to the tune of 'We're on our way to Wembley', each time Fulham scored, as if this meant their football was somehow less pure. </p> <p>The FA is determined not to let commercialism infiltrate the sport as it has with the men's game, but the down-to-earth personalities of the Fulham players, together with their unsullied passion for football, ought to see them through the upheavals of the next few years.

      "bodyText": "Paul Merton used to have a joke that went: 'The first Tube station to be built in London was Baker Street in 1862.' Then, deadpan, after an impeccable pause: 'Well, what was the point of that? Where would you go?' When Fulham FC announced last June that, as of this season, their women's team was to become the first fully professional women's side in the UK, the response was very similar. 'The first thing people always ask is \"Who do you play?\"' says general manager Gary Mulcahey, 'as if we're suddenly stuck in this league on our own with no one to compete against.' The answer is that they still compete - in the loosest sense of the word - against the amateur women's teams which, in terms of league football at least, presents a painfully farcical spectacle. Standing on the touchline at Motspur Park, New Malden, on a damp February Sunday, I watch the pitiful sight of the Stowmarket team traipsing off the pitch after a humiliating 19-1 defeat at the feet of Mohammed Al-Fayed's girls. Exhausted, red-faced and dejected, half of them are pulling cigarette packets from the pockets of their shorts and lighting up before they even get to the bar; meanwhile the Fulham girls, lean and barely sweating, are racing upstairs to analyse the game over their stipulated ration of pasta and bottled water before an early night. After all, they're training at 10 the following morning. It could hardly be described as a sporting match; the Fulham side, fielding four internationals, play a smooth passing game and have barely let the ball cross into their own half (the one goal conceded was a silly defensive mistake, presumably due to the fact that the back four and goalkeeper Layla Young had forgotten what the ball looked like). Stowmarket, by contrast, look like a school team: disorganised, depressed and bewildered, they appeared to have psychologically abandoned the match even before kick-off. This has been the case with most of the league games this season; Fulham have a lead of Man United proportions, and boast seven of the division's 10 top scorers. It's like pitching Fergie's boys against your dad's Sunday League team; don't they ever get bored by the ritual slaughter? 'Not with Stowmarket!' says defender Ronnie Gibbons, 21, indignantly. Ronnie is one of the team's pin-ups, with her own cabal of groupies; petite and blonde, with a pretty, pixie face, she also plays for the Republic of Ireland and appears quite incensed with Stowmarket. 'They're second in the league, yeah? And the last time we played them we won like 6-0, and they sent us this email saying, for a professional side you're not all that, you know, you're not organised and whatever. So we thought we'd show them this time. It's like, so we're not that good, then? It helps if you have a reason like that to really beat them.' Fayed had the idea of turning his club's women's team professional after a visit to the US some 18 months ago. They were then in the South East Combination League, the third division, and they are still in that division this season, their first as professionals. The resulting gulf in class has seen a succession of results of Stowmarket dimensions, and though their league games this season have been tedious for all concerned - particularly the trail of crushed opponents left in their wake - it is, as their manager Frank McMorrow points out, surely better than being able simply to buy their way into the Premier League. By the time they reach the Premier, however, as they look certain to do by 2003, the face of women's football in this country may have changed entirely. By then the women's game, or at least the *lite part of it, may have gone professional. The FA have already conducted research into the possibility, though it is concerned that a professional league should be carefully regulated so that the women's game doesn't fall victim to rampant commercialism. 'It must be in the interests of the whole game,' explains Katherine Knight, women's football press officer for the FA. 'Unless all the teams can turn professional with the same support it won't work. What we don't want is a situation where two or three clubs have the money to spend on the best players and the others suffer. It's no good for anyone if teams like Fulham go through the season beating everyone else 12-0.' Given that the concept of professional women footballers is uncharted territory for everyone concerned - including the footballers' union, the PFA, which has granted the Fulham Ladies the same union rights as male players, and the FA itself, which has been obliged to draw up new contracts that include full maternity rights (two of the Fulham players are mothers) - it's not surprising that everyone within the game is keeping a close eye on Fulham Ladies in their first professional season. 'For me, this is like a dream come true,' says Permi Jhooti, 30, who signed from Chelsea two years ago. Permi is gamine and articulate, and is the first British-born footballer, male or female, to have been called up to play for the Indian national side. She is also unique among the team in having had a separate working life that ran parallel to her football: when not training, she is busy writing up her PhD thesis in computer science at Imperial College, and has previously set up her own internet business. 'I'm hoping to be able to play for at least another five years,' she says, though she is just getting over a serious injury that has kept her out of the side.

The girls are jostling noisily into position for a group photograph when a tall, silver-haired man from the frowning table approaches. 'So do I gather you're a football team?' he asks, smoothly. The girls bellow their confirmation. 'I'm the vice-president of Chelsea,' he announces, and Rachel McArthur, without missing a beat, says: 'Ah. Take a seat.' And suddenly they're launched into a high-octane charm offensive, talking over each other, impressing their credentials, shouting about their cup prospects. Frank smiles with paternal indulgence but keeps a watchful eye on the proceedings. Not that he's in any danger of having his players poached at the moment, but in a few years, it's not impossible that top rank players such as Rachel or Katie might be attracting agents and big money.

      "bodyText": "Ian Paisley is set to take the greatest gamble of his 40-year political career by challenging David Trimble head to head in the First Minister's own constituency at the general election. Paisley is under pressure from senior strategists in his Democratic Unionist Party to stand against Trimble in Upper Bann. The electoral battle will be a struggle for the future of unionism: Trimble's new power-sharing secular brand, or Paisley's old style emphasis on loyalty to faith and crown and No Surrender. DUP sources told The Observer their leader would be 'parachuted in' from his own North Antrim constituency to take on Trimble in his own backyard, which includes the loyalist citadel of Portadown and Drumcree. It is understood Paisley's son, Ian junior may stand in North Antrim, where the DUP leader polled more than 21,000 votes at the last general election. One source in the party said: 'The big man has still to make his mind up fully but that is the plan.' Trimble said yesterday that he was aware of the scheme. He suspected the DUP wanted a heavyweight to stand against him after it picked a relatively unknown candidate, David Simpson, for the Upper Bann contest. The First Minister told The Observer his Ulster Unionist Party had 'thought from the start that David Simpson was just a discard. Ever since he was selected we have thought he was just there to fill a space. The big question was, had Ian Paisley Senior the bottle for it. 'I am sure I will win.

The outgoing Ulster Unionist MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, Ken Maginnis, launched a scathing attack on the DUP yesterday over its plans to take that seat too. Maginnis, who is standing down after 18 years at Westminster, claimed the DUP had now reached 'crisis point', and he challenged its leadership to debate publicly its alternatives to the peace process. The DUP deputy leader Peter Robinson had earlier hinted his party was willing to withdraw its candidate from the constituency, the Stormont Minister Maurice Morrow, if it would maximise the anti-agreement vote. Amid speculation that local man Jim Dixon was preparing to stand in the area, Robinson said he would be prepared to discuss with him how best to approach the election.

      "body": "<p>The perennial loser Yosser Hughes from Boys from the Blackstuff, eyed Graeme Souness - then still patrolling Liverpool's midfield with awesome authority - and told him: 'I cudda been you. I could do that. Gissa job.' Tomorrow Liverpool's modern millionaire superstars will come face to face with Wycombe's very own Yosser - Keith Ryan, in the biggest semi-final mismatch in FA Cup history. </p> <p>Ryan drove up to Wycombe in their non-league days to drop off his cousin, Steve Whitby, who was trying out with the club, decided he could do just as well and demanded a trial. Unlike Yosser, he got the gig and has been there ever since. </p> <p>'I was a teenager playing for Berkhamsted Town in the Ryman League,' Ryan says. 'Wanderers had been tipped off about Steve and one or two others in our side, but I wasn't one of them. Steve was invited to train and I asked the reserve team coach Jim Melvin for a trial. He must have wondered what I was doing, but they gave me a go, I played for the reserves and scored. And, 11 years later, here I am.' </p> <p>'Here' is Wycombe's Adams Park, reached by the most unpretentious approach in league football, at the end of an industrial estate, past the Ben Shaw's pop factory. 'Here' is also the biggest game in Ryan's life - today's FA Cup semi-final at Villa Park. </p> <p>Ryan is not fazed. At 29 he knows the job in hand; he knows they deserved their victories in past rounds against the likes of Wolves, Wimbledon and, most of all, Leicester City in the quarter-final. </p> <p>'I've had a good career and I love it here,' he says. 'I've got a new two-year contract and at this level it's great to have that sort of security, but I'll tell you something: I could have played at a higher level.' </p> <p>It's almost a Yosser Hughes moment but Ryan is deadly serious. He continues: 'I could have gone to, say, Norwich or Leicester, but for the fact that I've done my cruciates in both knees.' </p> <p>There is certainty in Ryan's voice because those clubs were managed by Martin O'Neill, the man who introduced Ryan into the Wycombe side and who is regarded by Ryan, now the Wycombe skipper, as simply 'special'. </p> <p>'Martin's told me on more than one occasion that he'd have signed me but for those injuries,' he says, matter-of-factly. 'But I can't dwell on that because I know that I could so easily have been out of the game with those injuries not so long ago. Yet here I am in an FA Cup semi-final.' </p> <p>The extraordinary between O'Neill and the players he coached in his first crack at management is evident in Ryan's account of the aftermath of Wycombe's 2-1 fifth-round victory at Filbert Street, courtesy of 'Teletext' striker Roy Essandoh's winner, the player who answered an on-screen ad to solve manager Lawrie Sanchez's injury headache. Less than 10 minutes after the final whistle, TV commentator and Wycombe director Alan Parry's mobile rang. It was O'Neill - whose last charges in England had just been knocked out by his first. </p> <p>He asked Parry for Ryan. 'He congratulated us and said it was \"The result of the century\" - that shows you the sort of man he is, the manager he is,' says Ryan. 'In the middle of everything that was hap pening, he thought about us, the guys he managed 10 years ago. That's something, isn't it?' </p> <p>O'Neill reaffirmed that bond recently by inviting all three of his surviving Wycombe players - Ryan, Dave Carroll and Jason Cousins - to the Old Firm game in February. 'He must have been so preoccupied on a day like that, but he treated us like royalty. It was a fantastic day.' </p> <p>O'Neill saw enough in midfielder Ryan to offer him full professional terms when Wycombe made the big leap from the Conference to league status eight years ago. It meant Ryan's days of evening training, picking up a useful second income from the game while concentrating on his job as a carpet fitter were over. But at a cost. </p> <p>'I probably lost 30 per cent of my income by giving up my job,' he says,'but there was never any chance of my turning down the chance. It's what I dreamed of, what I'd worked for. It was a bit hard at first, but so what?' </p> <p>Wycombe have launched some of the game's bigger managerial names. Ryan has played for O'Neill, John Gregory, Neil Smillie - the ex-Palace winger - Alan Smith and now former Wimbledon Cup hero Sanchez. </p> <p>This year's Cup run has been a hard slog: Harrow Borough, Millwall and Grimsby in the first three rounds. Wolves next - then Wimbledon in the fourth round. Wycombe drew at home and were then 'torn apart' by Sanchez's old club in the first half of the replay at Selhurst. </p> <p>'We were two down and Lawrie said to us at half-time, \"If we're going out of this competition, let's go out with a fight\". We clawed our way back and forced penalties. I missed mine but we still went through 8-7 in the shoot-out.' </p> <p>Victory today would make Wycombe the first third-grade league side to appear in an FA Cup final - but not at Wembley, though that does not upset Ryan. </p> <p>'I got to Wembley three times with Wycombe, and won all three. We won the FA Trophy in '91 and '93, and then we got to the final of the Division Three play-offs and beat Preston in 1994.' </p> <p>All those under O'Neill, of course. His old manager says: 'I'm so pleased for Keith Ryan, Dave Carroll and Jason Cousins. I've grown up with them. They haven't made money out of the game. They've never moaned, they've got on with it and loved it_ when we got into the league it cost those lads \u00a3100 a week to give up their jobs.' </p> <p>Ryan's family will be supporting him - including cousin Steve who moved to Slough before dropping out of football. There's dad Jim, wife Sarah and three-year-old daughter Amie. Mum Janet, 'a massive influence', died a few years ago. But there's an extra incentive now for Keith to do well. 'Sarah's pregnant,' he says. 'But it's the early stages so she should be able to stand the excitement.' </p> <p>First, however, Ryan has to be selected. He faces both a late fitness test after being rested last week and increased competition from new signings, such as Guy Whittingham up front0. 'I'm desperate to play,' he says. 'I want to be in the starting line-up. It's a mammoth task but we'll really be going for it.' </p> <p>And if a mobile phone rings for Keith Ryan again tomorrow 10 minutes after the final whistle, he'll be only too pleased to take the call.</p>",

      "trailText": "<p>Arsenal's Sylvain Wiltord talks to Amy Lawrence</p>",
      "byline": "Amy Lawrence",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Given the option of winning the FA Cup or Champions League, your average footballer's answer these days is so predictable it's not a question worth asking. Conversation with Sylvain Wiltord, a man who instinctively veers away from convention, hadn't gone anywhere near that seemingly pointless poser when he spontaneously admitted he'd prefer the faded old darling of English football to European eminence. </p> <p>Why? Simple, really. He has felt part of Arsenal's FA Cup campaign and peripheral in Europe. </p> <p>'I've hardly played in the Champions League,' he laments. 'If we win the Champions League it wouldn't mean so much to me and I'd feel a bit bitter because I like to participate. I like to give everything.' If that sounds outrageously selfish he doesn't mean it that way. His logic evolves from a childlike love for playing football. In the FA Cup he has been involved, changed games, outsmarted adversaries, scored in every round, savoured his celebrations, and generally done what he is best at. </p> <p>His choice might also have something to do with his forthright assessment on whether Arsenal can actually win the Champions League. 'Frankly, no. It's too hard,' he remarks. 'But never say never.' Arsenal's French livewire, as a footballer and as a man, is compellingly audacious. That is one of the reasons Ars\u00e8ne Wenger signed him in the first place for a club record \u00a313 million. </p> <p>The manager wanted to enhance his squad not just with a goalscorer, but also a personality - the sort of hyperactive individuality that disappeared when Ian Wright departed. He rather likes the comparison with the much-loved rogue of Arsenal's recent past, interrupting to sing, 'Yes! Me, I love to be alive. I love to have fun in the dressing room and have a laugh with everybody. But I also like to give a performance on the pitch.' </p> <p>Legs twitching, mischievous eyes darting all over the place, fiddling with whatever is in touching distance, he is like Zebedee, constantly on the verge of springing off on some tangent. He had a plane to catch but hey, once his tongue was wagging and he was rapping merrily away, that could wait. </p> <p>You can imagine Wiltord's single-minded spontaneity makes him hot to handle but also as confident as they come. No inferiority complex about competing with the Bergkamps and Kanus for a spot alongside Thierry Henry. </p> <p>The fact that nobody - perhaps not even Wenger himself - knows the composition of Arsenal's strongest attack has had a stifling effect on all of his forwards at some point or another this season. Wiltord is not a happy rotatee. 'I find this situation really hard. I talk to the boss very often - sometimes it is a bit tense between us - because I don't understand why. Sometimes it works well with a partnership and the next game he chooses other forwards. We really don't understand. </p> <p>'As a player you want to experience pleasure, feel the ball, run around, go for goal, you know? I'm used to playing more than 50 games a year, as I have done for the past seven years in France. I'm used to that rhythm. When you are in and out it's hard to make progress. In France I always said I'm not a No 9 striker. I like prowling. I like to run all over the pitch and if I find myself in a goalscoring position I go for it. </p> <p>'My game is all about stamina, tenacity, outfoxing your opponent, and when you don't have enough playing time it's difficult to do that on a regular basis. You haven't seen the real Sylvain Wiltord. You see the real me over a season.' </p> <p>He was tempted to leave in January for Paris Saint-Germain. Having made such an effort to get to Highbury in the first place (by going awol from Bordeaux and outlining his demands publicly he made enough of a nuisance of himself to force the transfer) he felt stymied by lack of action.

      "bodyText": "Given the option of winning the FA Cup or Champions League, your average footballer's answer these days is so predictable it's not a question worth asking. Conversation with Sylvain Wiltord, a man who instinctively veers away from convention, hadn't gone anywhere near that seemingly pointless poser when he spontaneously admitted he'd prefer the faded old darling of English football to European eminence. Why? Simple, really. He has felt part of Arsenal's FA Cup campaign and peripheral in Europe. 'I've hardly played in the Champions League,' he laments. 'If we win the Champions League it wouldn't mean so much to me and I'd feel a bit bitter because I like to participate. I like to give everything.' If that sounds outrageously selfish he doesn't mean it that way. His logic evolves from a childlike love for playing football. In the FA Cup he has been involved, changed games, outsmarted adversaries, scored in every round, savoured his celebrations, and generally done what he is best at. His choice might also have something to do with his forthright assessment on whether Arsenal can actually win the Champions League. 'Frankly, no. It's too hard,' he remarks. 'But never say never.' Arsenal's French livewire, as a footballer and as a man, is compellingly audacious. That is one of the reasons Ars\u00e8ne Wenger signed him in the first place for a club record \u00a313 million. The manager wanted to enhance his squad not just with a goalscorer, but also a personality - the sort of hyperactive individuality that disappeared when Ian Wright departed. He rather likes the comparison with the much-loved rogue of Arsenal's recent past, interrupting to sing, 'Yes! Me, I love to be alive. I love to have fun in the dressing room and have a laugh with everybody. But I also like to give a performance on the pitch.' Legs twitching, mischievous eyes darting all over the place, fiddling with whatever is in touching distance, he is like Zebedee, constantly on the verge of springing off on some tangent. He had a plane to catch but hey, once his tongue was wagging and he was rapping merrily away, that could wait. You can imagine Wiltord's single-minded spontaneity makes him hot to handle but also as confident as they come. No inferiority complex about competing with the Bergkamps and Kanus for a spot alongside Thierry Henry. The fact that nobody - perhaps not even Wenger himself - knows the composition of Arsenal's strongest attack has had a stifling effect on all of his forwards at some point or another this season. Wiltord is not a happy rotatee. 'I find this situation really hard. I talk to the boss very often - sometimes it is a bit tense between us - because I don't understand why. Sometimes it works well with a partnership and the next game he chooses other forwards. We really don't understand. 'As a player you want to experience pleasure, feel the ball, run around, go for goal, you know? I'm used to playing more than 50 games a year, as I have done for the past seven years in France. I'm used to that rhythm. When you are in and out it's hard to make progress. In France I always said I'm not a No 9 striker. I like prowling. I like to run all over the pitch and if I find myself in a goalscoring position I go for it. 'My game is all about stamina, tenacity, outfoxing your opponent, and when you don't have enough playing time it's difficult to do that on a regular basis. You haven't seen the real Sylvain Wiltord. You see the real me over a season.' He was tempted to leave in January for Paris Saint-Germain. Having made such an effort to get to Highbury in the first place (by going awol from Bordeaux and outlining his demands publicly he made enough of a nuisance of himself to force the transfer) he felt stymied by lack of action. A son of the hip hop Parisian suburbs, he gave a return to his roots serious thought. Ultimately he turned it down because he would have felt 'a bit of a failure' after only a few months of his foreign adventure. So he knuckled down. Famously a rebel in his youth - a lingering trait, judging by the fact that Wenger had to admonish him after partying until the early hours before a game - he is getting better at controlling his emotions. February served up the truest test of his resolve when kicking his heels on the bench in the Champions League win at Lyon, in front of all his family, hurt deeply.

'There is no need for anxiety and impatience when we are in such a fantastic position, and in any case I am more than capable of doing enough worrying for all of you.' </p> <p>It is O'Neill's turn to relax now, although Celtic's woeful finishing kept him waiting right until the final whistle. It is already being said that Rangers made a present of the title this year, and that winning the Scottish Premiership cannot be all that difficult if it can be accomplished with Premiership cast-offs like Chris Sutton and Ramon Vega. But there is no need for O'Neill to listen. A few of those opinions were being voiced at the start of the season, and O'Neill was brave enough to take the job when failure - finishing second - was a possibility many were predicting. </p> <p>The first obstacle safely negotiated, O'Neill and Celtic now face the biggest challenge of all. Staying in Europe until after Christmas. No Celtic team have managed that for over 20 years, and Rangers last achieved it eight years ago. In England, three clubs are attempting to reach the last four of the Champions League, and O'Neill's achievements will continue to be viewed sceptically south of the border unless he can buck the trend of national under-achievement. O'Neill knows the score. His pleas for money to be spent on the team for next season are wholly with a European campaign in mind. </p> <p>Between now and the Champions League, however, O'Neill can bask in the glory of winning a title at the first attempt. He had already been linked with the Manchester United job before leaving England, and this success will not do his CV any harm, though it is a patronising habit of the English to measure success in Glasgow in terms of its potential impact on Manchester or London. O'Neill still has two years of his original contract to run, and believing him happy in a spiritual home, Celtic are in no hurry to tie him down to a longer one. Whatever it says on his contract, O'Neill is likely to stay for as long as he enjoys it, or until he gets an offer he cannot refuse. The Manchester United job will not become vacant for another year anyway, and even then the shrewder candidates might decide that directly following Sir Alex Ferguson is not the smartest managerial move. </p> <p>Celtic chairman Dermot Desmond has already raised the Old Trafford question with O'Neill, who in addition to pledging his immediate future to his present club said it would be difficult to improve on what Ferguson had achieved. </p> <p>You could certainly see O'Neill fancying a few more years of this. The manager was given the man of the match award in a gesture of appreciation and in the stand opposite his dugout, Tommy Johnson's winning goal was the signal for 13 pink cards to be raised in unison spelling out the manager's name. That's right, 13. One fan came to this game armed with an apostrophe. That's dedication. </p> <p>'It's been a phenomenal day - as good as any I've had in football,' O'Neill said. 'I wanted to win it today and I wanted to win it here. This is everything and more than I've dreamed of. At times it has seemed like the longest season of my life, though in some ways it only seems five minutes since August. Maybe the reason we won was because Rangers have not had such a clever season, but my old boss Brian Clough used to say that teams that win the championship have usually been the best. I hope we can do this for the next three years, but I can't see us ever winning 28 out of the first 33 games again.' </p> <p>O'Neill revealed that it was after the season resumed following the winter break that he thought the title was coming his way. He said: 'There were a couple of significant matches. The Hearts game, where we won 3-0 - and the win against Motherwell was another. I didn't want to give anybody hope who was chasing us at the time.' </p> <p>He acknowledged the next challenge is Europe. 'We have to strengthen the side for Europe - but I can't think about that today,' he said. 'Maybe in a month or so. I can't begin to talk about retaining the title next season either. If we don't retain it, I'll not be here, that's the nature of their job. All I want now is to enjoy this. Pat Jennings told me he never really took the time to savour his winning days - I'm not going to make that mistake. I'm going to enjoy it tonight, tomorrow, and the day after - maybe right through to July.'</p>",

Rep was a teen idol, Suurbier would arrive at Ajax's morning practice still in his dinner jacket from the night before, Krol could barely speak a sentence, and Neeskens seldom tried to. There is significant intellectual capital going to waste here.",

      "body": "<p>Robbie Fowler regards the 1996 FA Cup final as his worst sporting memory. Liverpool losing to Manchester United at Wembley, that is, not turning up for the occasion in ghastly white suits. </p> <p>Looking back on the twin horrors beneath the twin towers, Fowler is hopeful his side might soon put the result of their last FA Cup final behind them. The suits are another matter. 'They caused a lot of comment, both among the players and the supporters,' the present Liverpool captain says. 'To this day I swear that when we walked out at Wembley everyone thought we were the band.' </p> <p>It might be added that this illusion did not entirely disappear when Liverpool donned green shirts and started playing, although in fairness Manchester United were not much better in one of the most disappointing FA Cup finals. 'It was a terrible game, everyone stopped each other playing and it must have been dreadful for the fans,' Fowler says. 'To lose in any cup final is terrible, but to come unstuck against United after we had been playing so well was really bad news. We felt we deserved something that year, and you never know, if we had won that day we might not have had to wait five years to win something else.' </p> <p>You never do know how the future will turn out, though, as Fowler appreciates only too well. Early promise does not always translate into later success, and even the sort of goalscoring prowess that brought Fowler universal acclaim as the new Jimmy Greaves is no guarantee of an easy life or a place in the England team when it matters. Just ask the old Jimmy Greaves. Fowler won his first cap as a 20-year-old in in 1996, but despite being peripherally involved with England ever since, the past three tournaments have passed him by. </p> <p>The same could be said of Steve McManaman, a brief contribution to Euro '96 apart, but at least Fowler's great mate can now boast a Champions League winner's medal and the satisfaction of having proved himself at the very highest club level. Should Liverpool win today Fowler will be captain for the FA Cup final, a great honour for any scouser. He just won't be certain of playing. The Robbie Fowler who turns 26 this week is far less certain of anything than the teenager who used to score for fun, three serious injuries, several notorious pranks and about a million different rumours ago. </p> <p>'It was easy for me when I first started,' he says. 'I was a regular in the team from an early age, I was scoring goals, and it all seemed to come naturally. I've always been confident, and at that time I never had to think about things too much. I just did it. Injuries change all that, though. When you've been out for a while it means you can't take anything for granted any more. The game got a lot quicker even in the short time I was out, which was one problem, another was that I kept coming back too quickly. Or rather, I kept thinking I was back before I was. I was trying to go straight to stage five, without stopping at two, three and four. You've got to take things nice and steady, and I had to learn that. I don't think I'm far away now, though I'd be lying if I said I was perfect.' </p> <p>Fowler looks sufficiently like his old self to please G\u00e9rard Houllier, whose sup port helped him when he was at a low ebb with his second ankle injury and when he was understood to be available a few months ago. But while practically every Premiership manager would be interested in such a reliable scorer, few would expect later versions of the player to reproduce the carefree charm of the original. The whole point about the young Fowler was that he didn't have to think about his game, he was one of the best examples of an instinctive brilliance. The instinct is still there - 'If we can create chances, I know I'll score goals' - but for better or worse Fowler now thinks about his situation. </p> <p>He possibly doesn't need to, almost certainly doesn't want to, but Fowler cannot turn the clock back to a time when life was simpler. 'When you come back from a long injury you realise how fortunate you are to be playing,' he says. 'You remember what happened to people like Rob Jones, who had a bad knee injury and never really played again, and you begin to treat every game as if it might be your last. I probably did take things for granted when I was younger, just because I found it so easy.' </p> <p>Liverpool supporters will be able to identify with that. At one time the perennial champions exercised a divine right to treat Europe as a playground; now they are sweating over beating Ipswich and Leeds to third place in order to make their Champions League debut at the ninth attempt. Fowler is as much an FA Cup traditionalist as the next man - 'I was a big Everton fan as a boy,' he says, as if no further explanation was necessary - but he is keenly aware of the modern realities. 'We have got to qualify for the Champions League this season,' he admits. 'If we don't, it would take the gloss off anything else we achieve.' </p> <p>Fowler appeared for the last 15 minutes of the goalless draw in the Nou Camp on Thursday which should set up one of the great European nights at Anfield next week, yet Barcelona are even more embarrassed than Liverpool about being in the Uefa Cup. These days the Champions League is everything, and though he insists his future remains with his home-town club, Fowler freely admits to following McManaman's career in Spain with interest laced with envy. 'I was made up for Steve when Real won the European Cup, as much as I was a little bit jealous at the same time,' he says. 'He's won something that I'm still dreaming about, but as a Liverpool lad I can't help feeling I'm at the right club to win silverware, even though we've had a bit of a wait.' </p> <p>The waiting may soon be over. Liverpool appear to have changed for the better under Houllier.But has Fowler? 'I wouldn't say I've changed,' he says. 'I'm 26 this week, still a young lad. At that age you are going to go out, aren't you? I think people want you to change, because they don't want to read silly things about you, but I'm sensible enough not to do stupid things any more. I just want to concentrate on football.' </p> <p>There are enough mixed messages there to keep Houllier sleepless for a week, but the manager will not have been expecting anything else. Fowler is growing up off the pitch as well as on it, and in both cases he realises he will be judged not on what he says, but what he does.</p>",

      "body": "<p>League championships like wars, only occasionally end abruptly, the outcome determined by one decisive battle. The identity of the winners is normally evident long before the official cessation of hostilities, those celebrating victory putting a light to the street bonfires while the boys are still at the front. </p> <p>The parties acclaiming Celtic's first title triumph in three years, and only their second in the past 13, were detonated a full 24 hours before this expected confirmation of their soaring superiority in Scotland, leading, almost inevitably, to an overwhelming impression of anti-climax during the play itself. </p> <p>In the circumstances, it is difficult to view occasions like these as you would an ordinary match. The critical faculties tend to be suspended as the so-called contest becomes merely a theatrical event. </p> <p>Going through the formalities of securing the win that would take them an insurmountable 22 points ahead of Rangers (the outgoing champions playing the first of their seven remaining games against Hibs in Edinburgh tonight) was much more like a perfunctory chore than an exhibition of the qualities that have made Martin O'Neill's side this season the best by a distance. </p> <p>The Parkhead players, especially during a second half in which the awareness of their tantalisingly close triumph seemed to overcome them, appeared more like soldiers fearful of engaging in dangerous skirmishes on the eve of the armistice. </p> <p>It should not have come to this, Celtic having been so aggressive and menacing before the interval that it seemed inexplicable they should go in for tea with only a one-goal lead. St Mirren, not unexpectedly, were terrorised to the extent that the home side had 15 scoring attempts, an average of one every three minutes. </p> <p>The fact that only five of them were on target tends to disguise the closeness of many of the others, the ball sliding marginally wide of both of Ludovic Roy's posts on six occasions. Some of these were the result of outstretched toes from defenders frantically trying to deflect wicked low crosses to safety. </p> <p>St Mirren rarely succeeded in stretching Celtic, although there were moments when they could have dumbfounded the huge home support by scoring.

      "bodyText": "League championships like wars, only occasionally end abruptly, the outcome determined by one decisive battle. The identity of the winners is normally evident long before the official cessation of hostilities, those celebrating victory putting a light to the street bonfires while the boys are still at the front. The parties acclaiming Celtic's first title triumph in three years, and only their second in the past 13, were detonated a full 24 hours before this expected confirmation of their soaring superiority in Scotland, leading, almost inevitably, to an overwhelming impression of anti-climax during the play itself. In the circumstances, it is difficult to view occasions like these as you would an ordinary match. The critical faculties tend to be suspended as the so-called contest becomes merely a theatrical event. Going through the formalities of securing the win that would take them an insurmountable 22 points ahead of Rangers (the outgoing champions playing the first of their seven remaining games against Hibs in Edinburgh tonight) was much more like a perfunctory chore than an exhibition of the qualities that have made Martin O'Neill's side this season the best by a distance. The Parkhead players, especially during a second half in which the awareness of their tantalisingly close triumph seemed to overcome them, appeared more like soldiers fearful of engaging in dangerous skirmishes on the eve of the armistice. It should not have come to this, Celtic having been so aggressive and menacing before the interval that it seemed inexplicable they should go in for tea with only a one-goal lead. St Mirren, not unexpectedly, were terrorised to the extent that the home side had 15 scoring attempts, an average of one every three minutes. The fact that only five of them were on target tends to disguise the closeness of many of the others, the ball sliding marginally wide of both of Ludovic Roy's posts on six occasions. Some of these were the result of outstretched toes from defenders frantically trying to deflect wicked low crosses to safety. St Mirren rarely succeeded in stretching Celtic, although there were moments when they could have dumbfounded the huge home support by scoring. This is unavoidable in even the most imbalanced contest - one team rarely enjoy an entirely trouble-free 90 minutes - but the opportunities that came the visitors' way seem almost irrelevant when set beside the number of chances squandered by the winners. Tommy Johnson was an unlikely hero, given the extraordinary contribution made by Henrik Larsson through the 10 months since the championship began. The Swede had one of his poorer matches, at one point released on a killing pass from Lubomore Moravcik, carrying the ball too wide of Roy, and allowing Barry McLaughlin to intercept the attempted cut-back. Johnson had seemed the improbable saviour, however, for another, less acceptable reason. The striker, whose presence in the team in place of the suspended Chris Sutton betrays O'Neill's limitations in that area, had missed a series of convertible opportunities before producing the goal that counted. Principal among Johnson's misses were driving the ball against the keeper after Larsson's pass had left him unchallenged just 16 yards out, and pulling his shot wide of the far post after Moravcik's cute reverse pass had given him a clear chance from the left of goal. Even when he scored, Johnson had looked awkward. It was a precision move that led to the moment, Alan Thompson playing the ball forward to Larsson on the left and the striker teasing defenders towards him before sliding the pass to the unmarked Johnson. The former Villa forward, with only Roy to beat, missed the ball as he tried to bring it under control and it ran over his feet. With the advancing Roy looking favourite to make the block, Johnson reached the ball with his right foot and turned it under the goalkeeper's body and over the line from about 12 yards. If Celtic's best players on the day were in midfield and defence - Moravcik, Ramon Vega, Johan Mjallby and the ever-impressive Neil Lennon and Paul Lambert - it would be rather churlish to accuse the others of mediocrity on such a momentous occasion. All have made their mark in a season which no Celtic supporter could have fantasised about when Rangers won last year's championship by 21 points. For the fans, the most encouraging element of O'Neill's awesome influence is the sense of permanence about his work.

Which of those would you drop for Pavel Nedved? Rivaldo has already had his annual mention, but the time for that signing has surely passed. Doubtless United will find it easier to conclude that Dwight Yorke has had a disappointing season, that Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer are best used as substitutes after all, and come up with the name of Ruud van Nistelrooy all over again, although another Dutchman who would fit the bill perfectly is Patrick Kluivert. </p> <p>That does not solve United's immediate problem, however, which is how to overturn the deficit in the Olympic Stadium on Wednesday week. Obviously they will fight to the bitter end against Bayern, and they must take whatever hope they can from their various triumphs over adversity two years ago, but there is a feeling United have not moved forward much in those two years. It would be a mistake to write them off, especially when a single goal could change the whole picture, but the element of surprise which served them so well in 1999 is missing. Other teams have got them worked out, and certainly United struggled to come up with anything the Bayern defence was not prepared for on Tuesday. It made no difference when Andy Cole and Solskjaer stationed themselves out wide or when Beckham and Giggs cut inside, Bayern were ready and waiting. </p> <p>United will not even have Beckham for the next leg either, although to be brutally frank the England captain did not put in the kind of first leg performance to make this a crying shame. Yorke, Sheringham, Quinton Fortune and Jonathan Greening will come into the reckoning, but the player the fans would most like to see is Luke Chadwick, Old Trafford's favourite waif. The England under-21 international has not got much Champions League experience, but Bayern no longer have their first choice full-backs.

      "byline": "Philip French",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong> A One and a Two </strong> (173 mins, 15) Directed by Edward Yang; starring Wu Nianzhen, Issey Ogata, Elaine Jin </p> <p>British cinema appears to range quite widely over the social spectrum taking in the plight of refugees, the antics of lovable cockney gangsters, the consciences of IRA gunmen, the ingenious schemes of unemployed northerners, the artistic ambition of miners' sons, the romantic problems of well-heeled, unmarried thirtysomethings. What our movies rarely touch on, and never in any depth, are the anxieties and aspirations of the professional middle classes, who are invariably viewed as comic or parasitic, patronised the way the working classes once were. </p> <p>For this reason, Edward Yang's expansive film about an affluent, seemingly contented middle-class family in Taiwan, A One and a Two , will provide a welcome shock of recognition for many British moviegoers. Born in Shanghai in 1947, Yang was brought to what was then Formosa in 1949 and, like the hero of his new film, studied engineering before spending a decade in graduate school and working as systems designer in the States. He began filmmaking 20 years ago in Taiwan and has made six features, all elaborate social mosaics of life in Taiwan such as Taipei Story and the four-hour A Brighter Summer Day, ambitious, taxing movies in which I found more to respect than to enjoy. His new film is his best, most accessible to date and it deserves to find as large an audience in Britain as did his compatriot Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon . </p> <p>The film's original title is Yi Yi, which literally means 'one-one' or 'individually' in Chinese. But Yang chose for its Western release to call it A One and a Two , the phrase used by the leader of a jazz band to introduce a number. The implication presumably is that his film is an improvisation on established themes, shifting in direction and tone but with a definite structure. It begins with a wedding and ends with a funeral. </p> <p>At the centre of A One and a Two is N.J. Jian (Wu Nianzhen), a prosperous, BMW-driving businessman in his mid-forties, living in a flat in Taipei with his wife, outgoing 13-year-old daughter, withdrawn eight-year-old son and elderly mother-in-law. They are intensely serious, hard-working people and when the grandmother suffers a stroke that leaves her in a coma, they are deeply affected. The daughter, Ting Ting, feels obscurely guilty (her grandmother may have collapsed putting out the garbage she herself should have disposed of). </p> <p>Out of a misplaced respect, the little son, Yang Yang, cannot bring himself to address the comatose old woman. N.J.'s wife, Ming Ming, falls into a depression that leads to her going into a Buddhist retreat, though the family no longer have any formal religious practice. In fact, a spiritual void in their lives is one of their troubles. </p> <p>Meanwhile, N.J. faces a severe crisis in the electronics business where he is a partner. With serious cash-flow problems, should they form a business relationship with a leading Japanese manufacturer of computer games, managed by a Mr Ota? Or should they seek the support of a shifty Taiwanese company noted for its plagiarism and appropriately called Ato? </p> <p>At the same time, N.J. meets for the first time in more than 20 years the love of his life, Sherry, whom he jilted as a student because she was attempting to deter him from following his vocation as a musician and turn him into the engineer he ironically became. She's living in the States, married to a US insurance man who is trying to enter the lucrative Chinese market. </p> <p>Through his encounters with Sherry and Ota in Taiwan and Japan, N.J. considers his past, present and future.

      "bodyText": "A One and a Two (173 mins, 15) Directed by Edward Yang; starring Wu Nianzhen, Issey Ogata, Elaine Jin British cinema appears to range quite widely over the social spectrum taking in the plight of refugees, the antics of lovable cockney gangsters, the consciences of IRA gunmen, the ingenious schemes of unemployed northerners, the artistic ambition of miners' sons, the romantic problems of well-heeled, unmarried thirtysomethings. What our movies rarely touch on, and never in any depth, are the anxieties and aspirations of the professional middle classes, who are invariably viewed as comic or parasitic, patronised the way the working classes once were. For this reason, Edward Yang's expansive film about an affluent, seemingly contented middle-class family in Taiwan, A One and a Two , will provide a welcome shock of recognition for many British moviegoers. Born in Shanghai in 1947, Yang was brought to what was then Formosa in 1949 and, like the hero of his new film, studied engineering before spending a decade in graduate school and working as systems designer in the States. He began filmmaking 20 years ago in Taiwan and has made six features, all elaborate social mosaics of life in Taiwan such as Taipei Story and the four-hour A Brighter Summer Day, ambitious, taxing movies in which I found more to respect than to enjoy. His new film is his best, most accessible to date and it deserves to find as large an audience in Britain as did his compatriot Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon . The film's original title is Yi Yi, which literally means 'one-one' or 'individually' in Chinese. But Yang chose for its Western release to call it A One and a Two , the phrase used by the leader of a jazz band to introduce a number. The implication presumably is that his film is an improvisation on established themes, shifting in direction and tone but with a definite structure. It begins with a wedding and ends with a funeral. At the centre of A One and a Two is N.J. Jian (Wu Nianzhen), a prosperous, BMW-driving businessman in his mid-forties, living in a flat in Taipei with his wife, outgoing 13-year-old daughter, withdrawn eight-year-old son and elderly mother-in-law. They are intensely serious, hard-working people and when the grandmother suffers a stroke that leaves her in a coma, they are deeply affected. The daughter, Ting Ting, feels obscurely guilty (her grandmother may have collapsed putting out the garbage she herself should have disposed of). Out of a misplaced respect, the little son, Yang Yang, cannot bring himself to address the comatose old woman. N.J.'s wife, Ming Ming, falls into a depression that leads to her going into a Buddhist retreat, though the family no longer have any formal religious practice. In fact, a spiritual void in their lives is one of their troubles. Meanwhile, N.J. faces a severe crisis in the electronics business where he is a partner. With serious cash-flow problems, should they form a business relationship with a leading Japanese manufacturer of computer games, managed by a Mr Ota? Or should they seek the support of a shifty Taiwanese company noted for its plagiarism and appropriately called Ato? At the same time, N.J. meets for the first time in more than 20 years the love of his life, Sherry, whom he jilted as a student because she was attempting to deter him from following his vocation as a musician and turn him into the engineer he ironically became. She's living in the States, married to a US insurance man who is trying to enter the lucrative Chinese market. Through his encounters with Sherry and Ota in Taiwan and Japan, N.J. considers his past, present and future. In particular, he forms a warm friendship with the Japanese businessman and a mutual trust is created between these two honest men who converse in English. Moreover, Ota reveals himself also to be a dedicated musician when he takes over the keyboards at a karaoke bar to give a spellbinding version of Beethoven's 'Moonlight Sonata'. A One and a Two has a rich, complex, well-ordered plot and these business matters are subtly interwoven, as in an Altmanesque movie, with three other major strands. First, there are the problems of N.J.'s children whose mother has fled and whose father is preoccupied. Then there's the single, professional mother and her handsome teenage daughter in the next-door flat, with whom Ting Ting becomes emotionally involved. Third, there's N.J.'s brother-in-law, a reckless, recently married businessman, permanently in debt, whose chief associate has absconded to China with company funds, leaving him to face the law. You could say that N.J.'s family life is tinged with tragedy, that the people next door are the stuff of melodrama (under-age sex and murder turn up), while the brother-in-law's hectic life is pure farce. You might also see in N.J.'s family some sort of paradigm of Taiwan itself, this anxious, prosperous, insecure country of undefined status, its past confused, its future uncertain. But without creating any false hopes, Yang's deep humanism gives the film a strongly affirmative feeling. This is expressed especially through the probity of the self-questioning N.J. and the fundamental decency and precocious moral insight of his son and daughter. This is a magnificently acted, deeply affecting movie. There will not be many better this year.",

There are exceptions that prove the rule (Percy Adlon's C\u00e9leste , a portrait of Proust and his housekeeper, being one), but generally, the more ridiculous they are, the more I like them. Sadly you've never been able to see in this country Andr\u00e9 T\u00e9chin\u00e9's Les Soeurs Bront\u00eb (the one with Roland Barthes as Thackeray), possibly because when a very serious British distributor asked me whether it should be shown here, I replied: 'Of course, it's one of the funniest films of the decade.' </p> <p>Diane Kurys's Les Enfants du Si\u00e8cle, an earnest account of the torrid three-year affair in the early 1830s between the 29-year-old George Sand (Juliette Binoche) and the 23-year-old Alfred de Musset (Benot Magimel) is not quite in the Soeurs Bront\u00eb class. Still, it gets off to a good start with the trousered, lionised and vilified Sand shocking a literary salon with a reading of choice passages from her essay on female sexuality. This is followed by an exchange on the staircase outside between departing and arriving celebs: 'I didn't know you were coming, Musset' - 'Beuve, how are you?' This can't compete with the immortal dialogue between two literary giants passing in the street in the Warner Brothers' Devotion ('Good morning, Thackeray' - 'Good morning, Dickens') but it's a decent Gallic try. </p> <p>Kurys, who's marvellously accurate on postwar Europe in such semi-autobiographical pictures as Diable au Menthe and Coup de Foudre, is sailing without a historical compass in the 1830s. Her picture claims to be about a generation of artists who (according to the opening titles) 'grew up idealistic but at the same time cynical', but we learn nothing of the influence of the times or of the nature of their work. Sand smiles, suffers and loves her two children; De Musset has a terrible temper, an insatiable appetite for whores and swigs opium as if it were Evian. 'Can't you see? I need to live badly to write well,' he shouts. The picture ends as the bereft Sand poses for Delacroix with a glum, 'I'm ready.' Nothing here to match Merle Oberon's George Sand in A Song to Remember, who receives the news of Chopin's death while sitting in a portraitist's studio and proclaims imperiously: 'Carry on Monsieur Delacroix.' </p> <p>The Wedding Planner is the inauspicious cinematic debut of choreographer Adam Shankman who constantly cuts to music his supposedly comic dialogues and the participants' exaggerated reactions. What plot this lifeless comedy has turns on Jennifer Lopez as a brilliant wedding organiser incapable of finding a suitable mate, until in a San Francisco street she meets a vacuously handsome doctor (Matthew McConaughey) who - surprise, surprise - turns out to be the fianc\u00e9 of her next client. At the same time her matchmaking Italian-American dad has lined up a handsome peasant from the old country, who happens to be unskilled, ignorant of English and a couple of strands short of a spaghetti bolognese. The worst joke is having the penis he's accidentally broken off a statue stuck to McConaughey's hand with superglue. </p> <p>In Better Than Sex, natural history photographer Josh (David Wenham) meets dressmaker-designer Cynthia (Susie Porter) at a party in Sydney and spends most of the next four days in bed with her before his return to London. The endless bouts of love-making (including fellatio in a bathtub) are accompanied by their inner thoughts about sex and commitment, and montages of comments by his and her friends. </p> <p>Meanwhile, a female taxi driver sits outside playing a role similar to that of Anton Walbrook in La Ronde . Josh and Cynthia discover several things that are better than sex, emotional involvement for one. And the audience realises there are many things better than watching Better than Sex, though watching The Wedding Planner isn't among them. At least one saw a lot of Paris (and some dancing) in Last Tango in Paris. </p> <p>Rugrats in Paris: The Movie is a tolerable cartoon featuring the familiar gang of diapered devils on a destructive trip to France with their parents. However, the troublesome tots end up spending virtually all their time at a Japanese theme park outside Paris called EuroReptarLand. There they encounter a French villainess, Coco LaBouche (voiced by Susan Sarandon), who tries to run Cruella De Vil a close deuxi\u00e8me, they hijack a giant mechanical dinosaur, and they confront their first bidet ('a potty that sprays you'). There are laboured jokes about The Godfather and Godzilla , and the only member of the American troupe who can speak a word of French is a babe in arms - 'oui, oui' (geddit?). </p> <p><strong> Akin Ojumo writes:</strong> Barely a week after a report published by the Commission for Racial Equality lamented the lack of black and Asian faces on British television, the release of Spike Lee's Bamboozled seems grimly topical. But in Lee's rancorous satire the issue isn't the paucity of black faces on screen, rather the humiliating fate they suffer on it. Damon Wayans, affecting the strangulated tones of a New York Wasp, is Pierre Delacroix, a black Ivy League educated television writer under pressure from his white hipster boss (Michael Rappaport) to deliver a streetwise crossover hit: 'It's not dope, it's not sexy and it sucks,' raps Rappaport on being presented with a Cosby Show-like pitch. </p> <p>Delacroix is obviously a stuffed shirt because he constantly uses the archaic epithet Negro. Though, initially, his heart is in the right place, annoyed by Rappaport's stereotyping and aided by his assistant Jada Pinkett - the film's moral compass - he decides to create a modern Minstrel show so appalling and offensive it will be thrown off the air. The set-up is reminiscent of The Producers . However, in Mel Brooks's comedy the Hitler musical is a hoot, in Bamboozled the gaudy Mantan: The Millennium Minstrel Show , which echoes the denigrating vaudeville of Amos 'n' Andy, is so awful and old-fashioned, it couldn't become the hit it subsequently does. Is the mass US television audience so brainless? A glance at the top-rated shows of recent years - ER, Frasier, Seinfeld - suggests otherwise. </p> <p>The appropriation of black culture by corporate America and treatment of blacks on US television are worthy of satire, but this film is too heavy-handed. The cast of Mantan: The Millennium Minstrel Show wear black face make-up and letterbox red lipstick; the house band are the Alabama Porch Monkeys, who dress in chain gang garb; the lead character is a feckless fool called Sleep 'n' Eat. </p> <p>Lee frequently takes us on a plot detour as a character, often Pinkett's, stops and delivers a state of the nation address in case we've missed anything. There are also numerous cutaways to archive TV material and endless shots of minstrel memorabilia for much the same reason. The film starts promisingly enough, with its skewered look at the TV industry, but once the capricious Delacroix starts having pangs of conscience and Lee gets on-message, it goes downhill. </p> <p>The director sacrifices much of his usual visual gymnastics in Bamboozled but not his strident tone, which misses the mark here.

      "body": "<p>David Soul has brought all his dirty laundry along to the interview: his girlfriend's sister is arriving from the States on Friday, so he is on a mission to the dry cleaners. What with the laundry bags and the cigarette and the tennis ball for his poodle, David's hands are pretty full, so I relieve him of a grubby blue blanket as we walk on through Waterlow Park to Highgate. </p> <p>This is David's manor: he arrived in the UK from Los Angeles in 1995, lured by a West End theatre project that didn't come to fruition, and has never left. Now he and Alexa, his American actress girlfriend of eight years, seem entrenched in north London. There are the Hampstead dinners with David's great chum Martin Bell, for whom he campaigned against Neil Hamilton at Tatton; there are tickets to Arsenal matches; and, having rented the poet's childhood home on Highgate West Hill, he has even discovered John Betjeman, for Pete's sake. </p> <p>Watching the biscuit-coloured Czechy haring after the ball and mashing up daffodils makes David roar with laughter: a big, chuckly, warm noise, insulated with smokers' phlegm. 'If you'd told me I'd have a poodle one of these days, I'd have said, not on your life,' he says. 'You know, I'd have thought a poodle didn't go with this big, rangy guy - I always had labradors. Shows how your self-image changes.' </p> <p>Czechy, who has Eastern European ancestry, or something like that, loses interest in the ball and noses off in the opposite direction. 'Puppy! Fetch!' calls David, but the dog has something else on his mind. There is a pause while David briskly scoops the poop. So we visit the dry cleaners, offloading the blanket and two dozen scatter-cushion covers, and then the corner shop to buy three more tennis balls and a fresh pack of Marlboro Lights, and then it's back to the little cafe in the park. We sit outside, because David wants to smoke, and though it's chilly and damp and he's not wearing any socks, he seems unaware of the cold. </p> <p>He's a big bear of a man, given to gesticulation, and seems to exist in a shambolic state of rolling chaos: spilling coffee onto his saucer, patting pockets wildly in hope of a lighter, scattering Danish pastry crumbs and fag ash like a snow machine. There are still plans to do a film follow-up to Starsky and Hutch , the TV cop show that turned David and his co-star PaulMichael Glaser into Seventies icons; but the 57-year-old David, whose face now looks like an unmade bed, would be unlikely casting for the glowing, blond Hutch, who was always evangelical about tofu and yoga. </p> <p>In his latest role, he's playing a past-it cardiologist in the BBC's Holby City , a character who is unable to accept that 'the older you get, the tighter your jeans'. It's not what you might call his finest hour, but David is sanguine: 'I've done 600 hours of television, as an actor and director,but Holby City will open the door to something else. I don't know what that is yet.' </p> <p>That's the way he has always worked. Instead of a career plan, he has what he calls a 'throw-it-up-against-the-wall-and-see-what-sticks approach to life'. Quite a lot has been thrown against the wall over the years - a wall which many managers and agents must have smacked their heads against in frustration - and not much has stuck, apart from a brief but glorious stint as a pop heartthrob ('Don't Give Up On Us Baby' and 'Silver Lady') in the late Seventies, before the record company went belly-up. He has done time in mini-series and Michael Winner movies, has directed episodes of Miami Vice and Hill Street Blues, and starred in an antipodean tour of Blood Brothers; and yet in showbiz terms, he has never matched the popularity that came with Starsky and Hutch, with its odd blend of plastic plots, shoot-outs and macho sentimentality. Originally, David wanted to play Starsky, rather than the vegetarian one who never got to drive, but once signed up, he made Hutch his own. </p> <p>It was a big break for someone who had started off as 'The Covered Man', a singer who found bizarre celebrity by performing electric blues in a balaclava. ('Before I took it off, everyone in New York had an opinion about who The Covered Man was. A columnist on the New York Post thought it was Mayor Lindsey, trying to break into showbusiness, or Bob Dylan, trying to make it straight.') </p> <p>For a while after leaving the show, he disliked talking about it, impatient for the next chapter, but now he seems to have accepted that as far as the public is concerned, he will never escape Hutch, and has opted for a reconciliation. He still catches the show on TV occasionally - it's always being repeated somewhere - and, though he thinks on a technical level it looks fairly amateur, 'a little sophomoric', he's still proud of the fact that it pioneered the buddy detective series. 'Those guys were really there, really friends.' </p> <p>And then there was the homoerotic subtext. 'Oh, yeah!' David rubs his hands enthusiastically. 'We were called \"the two prime-time homos\". We thought that was great fun. We knew we'd made it then.' </p> <p>David has four ex-wives (Mim, Karen, Patti and Julia), so his relationship with his co-star, Paul Michael Glaser, has proved one of the most consistent of his life. Only yesterday, David called him to say happy birthday. The last time he was in the States, he stayed with Paul. I say they must get some funny comments when people recognise them out together, but David says: 'People feel good. It's a kind of affirmation that everything's OK.' </p> <p>You can see why this might be the case. At the time when it was first broadcast, Starsky and Hutch was accused of gratuitous violence - it was restricted viewing for most of my generation - but now, for all its hookers and pimps and drug barons, it looks extraordinarily balmy and innocent. Much more balmy than its stars' off-screen lives. Poor Paul Michael Glaser lost his wife and child to Aids. In the early Eighties, David was ordered to attend therapy classes for alcoholism after attacking his second wife, Patti, when she was seven months pregnant. At various points, he admits, he really lost the plot. </p> <p>'If you're working 16, 18 hours a day, television gets turned into something of huge importance. It's just a job, guys! I didn't realise that when I was doing it, I worked so fucking hard, week after week after week. I wanted to do a good job, get it right, and I think I forgot about life around me. So when someone says, \"Can you take the laundry out for me?\" you go, \"For Chrissakes! Can't you see I'm busy?\"' </p> <p>For a long time, he was haunted by the failure of his first marriage. Mim was a fellow student at Augustana College in Sioux Falls. They married in 1962. 'My first wife was my high-school sweetheart and when I first saw her, I was 15, and that was it. And it was! But that ended with a personal betrayal... it involved my best friend. And then everything after that was trying to recapture something.' </p> <p>Abandoned by Mim and his best friend, David became rather jaded about trust. Even now, he thinks strangers are a breeze, compared with people you know well. 'You don't have to invest in strangers. You say hello, give everything, knowing you can walk away.' The effect on his kids, five boys and a girl, ranged in age between 36 and 12, can only be imagined. </p> <p>'I think my kids have suffered from the fact that I've been married four times. That has put the distance between us.' That they are all based in the US adds a geographical barrier, although he goes over as often as possible, trawling from state to state for catch-up sessions. Has he been a good father? 'I try to be. I don't know. I do the best I can. But at the end of the day I have to accept myself for what I am. Not beat myself up.' </p> <p>Interestingly, although all of his divorces were bitter ('If it's going to be a nice divorce - don't bother to get divorced'), he's now on good terms with all the ex-wives. Mim, for instance, came over last summer to stay with him and Alexa. 'My ex-wives are all my best friends now. It's a great concept, isn't it?' he exclaims, with pleasure. 'Get a divorce, then become friends.' Friendship was something he overlooked while in those relationships. </p> <p>'I'm a very selfish person, self-centred... I hope you understand the context in which I'm saying that. I don't say that regretfully or in a judgmental way, it's a fact, and it's something I need to be aware of. I'm not an easy guy to live with... and maybe this wanderlust that I have didn't help.' </p> <p>The wanderlust has messed up his professional life as well as his personal. 'Because you don't focus on any one thing, you spread yourself perhaps too thin. Opportunities came my way which I passed up on, chiefly the opportunity for setting a priority for my career. So on the one hand I think, \"Yeah, that's the way life should be,\" and on the other I think, \"Jeesus, if I'd really just focused on acting, just acting...\" But it hasn't been possible.' </p> <p>There is a flipside to his irresolution. His father, now 86, was a Lutheran minister who went into Berlin during the airlift to work with a refugee organisation, and took his family with him. David always resented the church and the sacrifices it demanded. Back in Sioux Falls, the only time he saw his father show emotion was during the Sunday afternoon concerts put on by the local college orchestra - concerts David was forced to attend while his friends played football. </p> <p>'My father's a very liberal thinker, but he wears his feelings in a place you can't see them.' </p> <p>His mother, 'who has one of the quickest minds and is one of the most frustrated women I've ever met', was a promising contralto who abandoned her singing to look after her husband and raise five children. She never let the kids forget it. 'She took care of my father, but she took it out on us. You never ceased to be reminded of how much guilt you should feel for being in the way of your mom's progress. I was very critical about my upbringing. Still am. Their whole religious ethic was a horrible imposition when I was growing up.' </p> <p>Now that he and his parents have brokered a peace, he's closer to understanding it. 'My father was a really true servant of others, of mankind, not because he was saintly, but that was what he decided was what life was about. That has been his life. And that's hard to deny in myself. I've run away from it, avoided it, been horribly selfish, but I cannot deny that instinct in me.' </p> <p>Crunch time for David came with the final episode of Starsky and Hutch . 'It was a conscious choice on my part. I was sitting on the top of this mountaintop in a mansion which I built... beautiful house, pots of money... and I thought: now whaddaya gonna do? And that was when I decided to go back to South Dakota, my home state, and made my first documentary.' </p> <p>Just at the point at which he could have named his price, he made a film about the water table in the Midwest - not a sexy subject, but one which had been bothering him for some time. Over the years, for PBS and educational institutions, he has made several other documentaries on topics which have struck a personal chord: the collapse of Pittsburgh's steel mills, Native American land rights, the industrialisation of farming in the Midwest. His social conscience may have won him friends - he rang Martin Bell out of the blue in 1996, having admired comments he'd made on Newsnight about journalistic ethics - but it certainly hasn't made him any money. </p> <p>But then, he has never been smart in that way. He and Glaser, who blithely sold their 7.5 per cent share in the show for $100,000 apiece, just before international syndication, were squeamish about Starsky and Hutch merchandise when the public was gagging for it. 'The whole idea of seeing your name on a lunch bucket, a puzzle... I don't like it! It makes my skin crawl.' </p> <p>During the pop years, he relented and set up his own merchandising company, but made sure that the profits went to Save the Children. Has he finally thrown off his demons? I'd like to think so. At one stage, we are interrupted by an Italian teenager who is nervously waving a piece of paper and a pen. David asks her name and signs his own, below the word 'Joy'. </p> <p>I ask him if that still happens a lot. 'Yeah, yeah,' he says. 'Well, not a lot. I don't look for it so much any more.' </p> <p>\u0095 David Soul is in Holby City at 8pm on Tuesday 17 April, BBC1.</p>",

      "bodyText": "David Soul has brought all his dirty laundry along to the interview: his girlfriend's sister is arriving from the States on Friday, so he is on a mission to the dry cleaners. What with the laundry bags and the cigarette and the tennis ball for his poodle, David's hands are pretty full, so I relieve him of a grubby blue blanket as we walk on through Waterlow Park to Highgate. This is David's manor: he arrived in the UK from Los Angeles in 1995, lured by a West End theatre project that didn't come to fruition, and has never left. Now he and Alexa, his American actress girlfriend of eight years, seem entrenched in north London. There are the Hampstead dinners with David's great chum Martin Bell, for whom he campaigned against Neil Hamilton at Tatton; there are tickets to Arsenal matches; and, having rented the poet's childhood home on Highgate West Hill, he has even discovered John Betjeman, for Pete's sake. Watching the biscuit-coloured Czechy haring after the ball and mashing up daffodils makes David roar with laughter: a big, chuckly, warm noise, insulated with smokers' phlegm. 'If you'd told me I'd have a poodle one of these days, I'd have said, not on your life,' he says. 'You know, I'd have thought a poodle didn't go with this big, rangy guy - I always had labradors. Shows how your self-image changes.' Czechy, who has Eastern European ancestry, or something like that, loses interest in the ball and noses off in the opposite direction. 'Puppy! Fetch!' calls David, but the dog has something else on his mind. There is a pause while David briskly scoops the poop. So we visit the dry cleaners, offloading the blanket and two dozen scatter-cushion covers, and then the corner shop to buy three more tennis balls and a fresh pack of Marlboro Lights, and then it's back to the little cafe in the park. We sit outside, because David wants to smoke, and though it's chilly and damp and he's not wearing any socks, he seems unaware of the cold. He's a big bear of a man, given to gesticulation, and seems to exist in a shambolic state of rolling chaos: spilling coffee onto his saucer, patting pockets wildly in hope of a lighter, scattering Danish pastry crumbs and fag ash like a snow machine. There are still plans to do a film follow-up to Starsky and Hutch , the TV cop show that turned David and his co-star PaulMichael Glaser into Seventies icons; but the 57-year-old David, whose face now looks like an unmade bed, would be unlikely casting for the glowing, blond Hutch, who was always evangelical about tofu and yoga. In his latest role, he's playing a past-it cardiologist in the BBC's Holby City , a character who is unable to accept that 'the older you get, the tighter your jeans'. It's not what you might call his finest hour, but David is sanguine: 'I've done 600 hours of television, as an actor and director,but Holby City will open the door to something else. I don't know what that is yet.' That's the way he has always worked. Instead of a career plan, he has what he calls a 'throw-it-up-against-the-wall-and-see-what-sticks approach to life'. Quite a lot has been thrown against the wall over the years - a wall which many managers and agents must have smacked their heads against in frustration - and not much has stuck, apart from a brief but glorious stint as a pop heartthrob ('Don't Give Up On Us Baby' and 'Silver Lady') in the late Seventies, before the record company went belly-up. He has done time in mini-series and Michael Winner movies, has directed episodes of Miami Vice and Hill Street Blues, and starred in an antipodean tour of Blood Brothers; and yet in showbiz terms, he has never matched the popularity that came with Starsky and Hutch, with its odd blend of plastic plots, shoot-outs and macho sentimentality. Originally, David wanted to play Starsky, rather than the vegetarian one who never got to drive, but once signed up, he made Hutch his own. It was a big break for someone who had started off as 'The Covered Man', a singer who found bizarre celebrity by performing electric blues in a balaclava. ('Before I took it off, everyone in New York had an opinion about who The Covered Man was. A columnist on the New York Post thought it was Mayor Lindsey, trying to break into showbusiness, or Bob Dylan, trying to make it straight.') For a while after leaving the show, he disliked talking about it, impatient for the next chapter, but now he seems to have accepted that as far as the public is concerned, he will never escape Hutch, and has opted for a reconciliation.

      "body": "<p><strong>Through the Eyes of the Old </strong>BBC1 </p> <p><strong> Malcolm in the Middle</strong> BBC2 </p> <p> <strong> Clocking Off </strong>BBC1 </p> <p> <strong> EastEnders</strong> BBC1 </p> <p> There shouldn't be any space in the schedules for a 90-minute documentary about old people. It's like conceiving a programme about black people or Americans, or women or the animal kingdom - downright patronising, frankly. Just imagine, for example, a programme pitch thus: 'Yeah, it's gonna be 90 minutes with loads of young people filmed in their own environments talking about what it's like to be, like, young! ' Enough to make you want to tune into the QVC shopping channel for, like, the rest of your life, right? </p> <p> But given that there was room in the schedules for BBC1's Through the Eyes of the Old, I think it must have been aimed at the youngish ('Hey, old people! Cool!'), as it was, like, a roadmap for Wrinklyville, a crash-course in crinklydom. Which isn't to say that it wasn't fascinating, touching, funny, beautifully filmed and entirely engaging throughout, just that the very act of making a documentary about the old serves mostly to highlight their social exclusion and outsider status. </p> <p> Of course, older readers are welcome to write in and contradict me in the kind of no-nonsense prose you tend to favour.</p> <p> 'I am 83 years old, have read The Observer since 1929, have been married for 60 years and, frankly young lady, I don't give a damn what you think about... ' began one memorable missive I received a few years back. And I was thrilled because the younger generation simply don't care enough to take the time and trouble to tell you just how much they really don't give a damn in several thousand violet-inked copperplate words. No, they just scribble, 'SHUT up you, stupid ignorant cow?' and punctuate appallingly. </p> <p> Anyway, as if to emphasise the perception of elderly lives lived in a social exclusion zone, the majority of participants were accompanied by snapshots of their younger selves, perhaps meant to act as a validation and reminder that even the most stooped, baggy, watery-eyed, stammering, blurred-round-the-edges piece of crumpling humanity had a youth once, way back, oh, whenever (who'd have thought it, eh?!). </p> <p> But, for me, this device created an ever greater divide. For it isn't really the fact of a past youth that makes many old people interesting (or, indeed, just as many very, very dull), it's the accumulation of all those inconceivably time-consuming years afterwards, coupled with the revelation that being old can come as something of a shock, even to the old. This was sweetly articulated by the undeniably mature 94-year-old Margaret (a pensioner, after all, for most of my blink-and-you'd-miss-it life) in the programme's opening moments: 'My astonished reaction in the last couple of years is how sudden old age is. You look in the mirror and there's a different face there, and it's not you any more... ' </p> <p> Through the Eyes of the Old indicated that the best thing about ageing is the possibility that, should one remain as fabulously sharp and articulate (and somehow become as insightful) as Margaret (or 95-year-old Chelsea pensioner, Archie, or 83-year-old Battle of Britain hero Sir Christopher, or '88-and-a -half'-year-old pet bereavement counsellor Rita), one wouldn't just fester patiently in an armchair in God's waiting room, but might never stop being thoroughly surprised and angry and excited and daunted by life. The stuff that, after all, makes being very young such a fabulous rollercoaster and, comparatively, can make being stuck in the middle seem like treading ditchwater. </p> <p> The delightful Malcolm In The Middle (and it's not age he's in the middle of, but familial chaos) finally made its terrestrial debut on BBC2, though at a ridiculous hour.</p> <p>Why Friday at 6.45pm when this is a kid's programme in the same way that South Park and The Simpsons are kid's programmes - (ie: almost wasted on them)? Young Malcolm is the product of an averagely dysfunctional American home - mom and dad may still be together but his older brother has been banished to military school after a crime spree ('my new roommate showed me how to kill mice with a hammer yesterday, so between that and the general atmosphere of simmering homoeroticism, I think I'm really starting to turn around...'). And, even worse, Malcolm is diagnosed as having an IQ of 165. Given that this means being transferred from his junior high school class to a programme for gifted kids, he not unreasonably reacts as though he's contracted a rare and terminal disease ('round here, being smart is exactly like being radioactive'). To compound the problem, on his first day he's stared at by the other little geniuses: 'So, I'm the freak of the freakshow?'. </p> <p> Taut writing (by the fabulously named Linwood Boomer, who sounds like he might have suffered a bit at school himself) and very little of the glutinous sentimentality that often seeps into even the feistiest American comedy (The West Wing, for example) ensures that this is merely the latest US import to highlight - yet again - yawn - as if we needed it - how, although Britain can do funny, edgy populist TV, we can't often manage to do funny and edgy and populist all within the same half hour. </p> <p> Clocking Off came pretty damn close, but it took 60 minutes. Life in and around Manchester's Mackintosh Textiles is so subtly woven, smartly written and inspiringly cast that I confess I was ever-so-slightly surprised when the last series turned out to be as big a ratings hit as it was a critical success. And its welcome return also serves to demonstrate how much of this year's BBC's drama output has failed to hit the spot. Even with a paedophile storyline - fast becoming a TV clich\u00e9 - Clocking Off was a success partly because it wasn't afraid to depict the bad guy as a fully integrated member of the community, rather than as some shadowy but sinister local Lecter. </p> <p> Initially, Kev was delighted when his divorced colleague Brian moved in across the road, but then Kev started using his binoculars and didn't much like what he thought he saw on Brian's computer screen. Torn between his suspicions and the hope that he might be wrong, Kev (Jack Deam in a powerfully understated performance) kept quiet but vacillated angrily in his day-to-day dealings with his friend. Which was probably exactly what would happen in a real life, as opposed to a telly life in which the dramatic imperative tends to be necessarily greater than any drive for authenticity.</p> <p> Nonetheless, writer Paul Abbott's verisimilitude allowed for an ending in which Kev moved house without blowing the whistle on Brian, and that made a fine storyline even stronger. </p> <p> Kev had a wedding coming up and, if he wanted a straightforward life, he needed to save his skin rather than go out of his way to be a hero. But one didn't necessarily end up thinking any worse of him for it, either - testament to the quality of the acting, the plausibility of a potentially tricky storyline and the likeability of Deam's Kev. The actor with the toughest job was Paul Oldham as Brian, whose plaintive entreaty when confronted about his activities as a youth club leader - 'It's a mess with that lot because they're up for a laugh and messing about. It gets confusing, Kev' - brought a rare glimpse of humanity to what could easily have been a cardboard cutout of a baddie.</p> <p> That not all would-be have-a-go-heroes have it in them to realise their heroism (and that, yes, even paedophiles are human beings who might sometimes make you laugh despite yourself) is not obviously the stuff of prime-time hit drama, but then Clocking Off is rarely obvious. </p> <p> In the denouement to the EastEnders Who Shot Phil Mitchell? plot, Lisa's sad, guilty eyebrows were the stars, wiggling up and down like the lines on a positive lie-detector test while Phil shoutily waved the shooter abaht. </p> <p> Sadly, Lisa is too much of a tragic victim to make a really exciting wannabe-murderer, so I wish it had turned out to be, say, Dot wot dunit. Through The Eyes of The Old 's 94-year-old Margaret might well agree that there are just not enough pistol-packing OAPs on prime time. 'If I was physically fitter I'd be out on the streets, I'd break windows, I'd shout my head off!' would-be geronto-thug Margaret had declared. Well, I'm fairly sure she said 'shout'.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Through the Eyes of the Old BBC1 Malcolm in the Middle BBC2 Clocking Off BBC1 EastEnders BBC1 There shouldn't be any space in the schedules for a 90-minute documentary about old people. It's like conceiving a programme about black people or Americans, or women or the animal kingdom - downright patronising, frankly. Just imagine, for example, a programme pitch thus: 'Yeah, it's gonna be 90 minutes with loads of young people filmed in their own environments talking about what it's like to be, like, young! ' Enough to make you want to tune into the QVC shopping channel for, like, the rest of your life, right? But given that there was room in the schedules for BBC1's Through the Eyes of the Old, I think it must have been aimed at the youngish ('Hey, old people! Cool!'), as it was, like, a roadmap for Wrinklyville, a crash-course in crinklydom. Which isn't to say that it wasn't fascinating, touching, funny, beautifully filmed and entirely engaging throughout, just that the very act of making a documentary about the old serves mostly to highlight their social exclusion and outsider status. Of course, older readers are welcome to write in and contradict me in the kind of no-nonsense prose you tend to favour. 'I am 83 years old, have read The Observer since 1929, have been married for 60 years and, frankly young lady, I don't give a damn what you think about... ' began one memorable missive I received a few years back. And I was thrilled because the younger generation simply don't care enough to take the time and trouble to tell you just how much they really don't give a damn in several thousand violet-inked copperplate words. No, they just scribble, 'SHUT up you, stupid ignorant cow?' and punctuate appallingly. Anyway, as if to emphasise the perception of elderly lives lived in a social exclusion zone, the majority of participants were accompanied by snapshots of their younger selves, perhaps meant to act as a validation and reminder that even the most stooped, baggy, watery-eyed, stammering, blurred-round-the-edges piece of crumpling humanity had a youth once, way back, oh, whenever (who'd have thought it, eh?!). But, for me, this device created an ever greater divide. For it isn't really the fact of a past youth that makes many old people interesting (or, indeed, just as many very, very dull), it's the accumulation of all those inconceivably time-consuming years afterwards, coupled with the revelation that being old can come as something of a shock, even to the old. This was sweetly articulated by the undeniably mature 94-year-old Margaret (a pensioner, after all, for most of my blink-and-you'd-miss-it life) in the programme's opening moments: 'My astonished reaction in the last couple of years is how sudden old age is. You look in the mirror and there's a different face there, and it's not you any more... ' Through the Eyes of the Old indicated that the best thing about ageing is the possibility that, should one remain as fabulously sharp and articulate (and somehow become as insightful) as Margaret (or 95-year-old Chelsea pensioner, Archie, or 83-year-old Battle of Britain hero Sir Christopher, or '88-and-a -half'-year-old pet bereavement counsellor Rita), one wouldn't just fester patiently in an armchair in God's waiting room, but might never stop being thoroughly surprised and angry and excited and daunted by life. The stuff that, after all, makes being very young such a fabulous rollercoaster and, comparatively, can make being stuck in the middle seem like treading ditchwater. The delightful Malcolm In The Middle (and it's not age he's in the middle of, but familial chaos) finally made its terrestrial debut on BBC2, though at a ridiculous hour. Why Friday at 6.45pm when this is a kid's programme in the same way that South Park and The Simpsons are kid's programmes - (ie: almost wasted on them)? Young Malcolm is the product of an averagely dysfunctional American home - mom and dad may still be together but his older brother has been banished to military school after a crime spree ('my new roommate showed me how to kill mice with a hammer yesterday, so between that and the general atmosphere of simmering homoeroticism, I think I'm really starting to turn around...'). And, even worse, Malcolm is diagnosed as having an IQ of 165. Given that this means being transferred from his junior high school class to a programme for gifted kids, he not unreasonably reacts as though he's contracted a rare and terminal disease ('round here, being smart is exactly like being radioactive'). To compound the problem, on his first day he's stared at by the other little geniuses: 'So, I'm the freak of the freakshow?'. Taut writing (by the fabulously named Linwood Boomer, who sounds like he might have suffered a bit at school himself) and very little of the glutinous sentimentality that often seeps into even the feistiest American comedy (The West Wing, for example) ensures that this is merely the latest US import to highlight - yet again - yawn - as if we needed it - how, although Britain can do funny, edgy populist TV, we can't often manage to do funny and edgy and populist all within the same half hour. Clocking Off came pretty damn close, but it took 60 minutes. Life in and around Manchester's Mackintosh Textiles is so subtly woven, smartly written and inspiringly cast that I confess I was ever-so-slightly surprised when the last series turned out to be as big a ratings hit as it was a critical success. And its welcome return also serves to demonstrate how much of this year's BBC's drama output has failed to hit the spot. Even with a paedophile storyline - fast becoming a TV clich\u00e9 - Clocking Off was a success partly because it wasn't afraid to depict the bad guy as a fully integrated member of the community, rather than as some shadowy but sinister local Lecter. Initially, Kev was delighted when his divorced colleague Brian moved in across the road, but then Kev started using his binoculars and didn't much like what he thought he saw on Brian's computer screen. Torn between his suspicions and the hope that he might be wrong, Kev (Jack Deam in a powerfully understated performance) kept quiet but vacillated angrily in his day-to-day dealings with his friend. Which was probably exactly what would happen in a real life, as opposed to a telly life in which the dramatic imperative tends to be necessarily greater than any drive for authenticity. Nonetheless, writer Paul Abbott's verisimilitude allowed for an ending in which Kev moved house without blowing the whistle on Brian, and that made a fine storyline even stronger. Kev had a wedding coming up and, if he wanted a straightforward life, he needed to save his skin rather than go out of his way to be a hero. But one didn't necessarily end up thinking any worse of him for it, either - testament to the quality of the acting, the plausibility of a potentially tricky storyline and the likeability of Deam's Kev. The actor with the toughest job was Paul Oldham as Brian, whose plaintive entreaty when confronted about his activities as a youth club leader - 'It's a mess with that lot because they're up for a laugh and messing about. It gets confusing, Kev' - brought a rare glimpse of humanity to what could easily have been a cardboard cutout of a baddie. That not all would-be have-a-go-heroes have it in them to realise their heroism (and that, yes, even paedophiles are human beings who might sometimes make you laugh despite yourself) is not obviously the stuff of prime-time hit drama, but then Clocking Off is rarely obvious. In the denouement to the EastEnders Who Shot Phil Mitchell? plot, Lisa's sad, guilty eyebrows were the stars, wiggling up and down like the lines on a positive lie-detector test while Phil shoutily waved the shooter abaht. Sadly, Lisa is too much of a tragic victim to make a really exciting wannabe-murderer, so I wish it had turned out to be, say, Dot wot dunit. Through The Eyes of The Old 's 94-year-old Margaret might well agree that there are just not enough pistol-packing OAPs on prime time. 'If I was physically fitter I'd be out on the streets, I'd break windows, I'd shout my head off!' would-be geronto-thug Margaret had declared. Well, I'm fairly sure she said 'shout'.",

The girl who was born Madonna Ciccone and stayed that way emphatically through her first marriage to Sean Penn and the partnership with Carlos Leon which produced daughter Lourdes, has finally, at the age of 42, consented to become Mrs Guy Ritchie. Her credit card (American Express Platinum, naturally) says so and so does her white jacket. </p> <p>This would not matter much if Mrs Ritchie were not part of a growing group. Two years ago Victoria Adams became Victoria Beckham while Mel B became, at least for an unhappy short while, Mel G. Women, it seems, are increasingly taking their husbands' surnames when they marry, and not just in that \"Oh, let's both be called Smith on the gas bill because it's easier\" kind of way. Rather, it is a self-conscious means of marking a profound change in sense of self and wanting other people to witness it. </p> <p>'Last week at work an email came round from a woman letting everyone know that her name was going to change from Jane Carpenter to Jane Sadler. I found it inappropriately formal and intimate at the same time, as if she were announcing a sex change,' says Catherine Harrington, 39, a university lecturer. 'What's more, given that we both work in a social science faculty which runs courses on gender, feminism and women's history, it felt weird that here was a woman announcing that she was about to voluntarily take on her husband's identity. I mean, this isn't Lloyds bank in the 1970s.' Harrington has put her finger on the unease felt by that generation of women which is now over 35. Taking your husband's surname just seems so regressive: you may like sleeping with the enemy, but that doesn't mean you have to join his gang. </p> <p>Sarah Mather, who is 44 and on her second marriage, puts it succinctly and with passion: 'It took women centuries to achieve the right to a full legal and cultural identity independent of their husbands. To give that up because of some soft-focus, sentimental fantasy about \"happy ever after\" seems to me the worst kind of bad faith.' </p> <p>Mather is right to link naming and legal procedure. In the nineteenth century the legal doctrine of couverture meant that a wife had no legal identity separate from her husband. Echoes of couverture persisted until well into the twentieth century and it wasn't until 1935 that married women in Britain obtained the same rights over their property as single women. Hardly sur prising, then, that in the modern women's movement in the States in the late Sixties sisters chose to hang on to their own names. The realisation that these names came from their fathers and were therefore already tainted by patriarchy then led to some contorted compensating strategies. </p> <p>'For a time in the late Eighties there was this vogue for naming girl babies after their mothers and boy babies after their dads,' remembers Elizabeth Granger, 37, a New Yorker now relocated to London. 'Sending Christmas cards became a nightmare. You always felt that, unless you got all the names bang-on right, you were going to trample across some very delicate sensibilities. I used to long for the days when you could just put \"The Smith family\" on the envelope and leave it at that.' </p> <p>This kind of intricate if emphatic revisionism was never going to happen in Britain. Instead, married women muddled through with a series of spur-of-the-moment decisions about what they wanted to be called in any given situation, and lived with the consequences of their fudged identities. </p> <p>'When I had my little girl, I was determined to be known at the GP's surgery as Davies, even though Lottie's surname is Smart. But every time I went to make an appointment there was a 10-minute fuss while they scrolled through the records to match us up. In the end it was easier to give in and call myself Mrs Smart,' recalls Belinda Davies, 34, echoing the experiences of thousands of married women at the school gates, in dentists' surgeries and at the bank. </p> <p>At work, confusingly, the pressure is all the other way. 'I was delighted to give up my maiden name, which I've always hated.' says Sophie Lemon, 32, an advertising executive. 'But when I told colleagues I sensed a real chill among both men and women. It was if I was announcing, then and there, that from now on I would be knocking off at 5 pm and going home to cook fishfingers for my husband's tea. I could see a whole suburban, lower-middle-class fantasy evoked by my simple request to be known as Sophie Porter.' </p> <p>Madonna, presumably, did not share Sophie Porter's longing to be shot of her maiden name. In fact, her insistence on keeping it throughout her marriage to Sean Penn is said to have been one of the causes of their many rows - certainly Penn's present wife tactfully calls herself Robin Wright Penn. </p> <p>So what made Madonna choose to change her name? Perhaps this: today's love story has everything in a different order from the days when it belonged to our parents. These days babies arrive after flings and before relationships, and love settles in a cohabiting partnership but refuses to catch fire in a marriage. Madonna knows that anyone can get married - she had already done it once. She also knows that, with luck, pretty much anyone can have a baby, because she's already done that twice. What had eluded her up until now, perhaps, was that trickiest of things, an enduring love relationship. And having finally found it, in the middle rather than at the beginning of her adult sexual life, she wants to mark the moment for what it is: transforming.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Hi! this is 4 u - love and xxx k </p> <p>How should the ideal email be composed? I've often wondered whether there was a techie version of Nancy Mitford (an idea that would have made her swoon with distaste) who could supply us with the 'u and non u' of email, the 'e and non-e'? And now, incredibly, it seems that there is. </p> <p>Step forward Rolf Kurth of Debrett's. He intends to come to our rescue - and evidently we need rescuing. According to recent research (for the email provider MSN Hotmail), email is promoting rampant illiteracy. Non-letter writers are said to be offending in cyberspace with amorous sign-offs (to professional emails), hasty kisses and cavalier misspellings. These people do not know how to mind their e's (or queues). </p> <p>Netiquette is a touchy business. Not least of all because no one can agree on what it is. Unfortunately, Kurth, author of Debrett's Guide to Correspondence, proves a disappointment. He conservatively insists on preserving good writing as a form of politeness. This does not help me at all. When I write an email, I feel like a foxed beginner. If I treat an email as if it were a letter - in a style that Debrett's might pass - it seems arduous, futile, gawkily dated. I feel like the uncomfortable possessor of a tie at a picnic, or someone transfixed by nostalgia for an epistolary past (for 'snail mail'). Should I skip 'Dear X' and crack straight on with the message? Should I scrap upper case and dash ahead with lower-case panache to show myself a proper mistress of the form? What is the best tone to adopt? </p> <p>One thing is for sure: literature and emails do not get on together, as last week's cautionary tale about poet laureate Andrew Motion illustrated. Laura Fish, a novelist on a one-year creative-writing course at UEA, accused Motion (her tutor) of harassment; she claimed to have received 40 'explicit' emails from him. He has returned the accusation and has also been reported saying that he does not expect his emails to appear in any collected letters. I fear for his biography. But I am sure he is right to be dismissive about his emails. They are - almost always - inferior to letters. It is like writing on water. Emails beg to be deleted (save or print only if you must). </p> <p>Email invites informality, speed and jocularity. The 'subject' line asks for a witticism (tiresome, if your message is not intended to amuse). As one of my friends observes 'for some people the title/subject seems to be the key to the whole thing; they get thousands of emails and only bother with the enticing come-ons . For others, the come-ons are more than enticing. I have a friend who is an English philosophy professor working in the States. Let us call him Roland. </p> <p>He embraced email with zealous enthusiasm before any of his English friends had any experience of it. He fell in love, via a prodigious email correspondence, with another academic whom he had met fleetingly at a conference. A 'seed was sown' which flowered on the net. Now, he remembers the time (1994) as 'heady'. There was a liberating sense that, through email, you could 'be anything you liked'. Email, he points out, is particularly good for people who can be 'quite shy and hopeless face to face'. </p> <p>For the first couple of days, the emails between Roland and A (let us call her Anna) were flat - then 'suddenly this thing caught fire'. He found the speed 'really exciting. It's great when you're on a good footing - you have just had your thirteenth email, so immediately you send off a reply. Instead of waiting for the second post, you could be expectant all the time.' In a new relationship you would never write a love letter every day, let alone 13 times a day, nor would you 'phone to chat idly about breakfast or muse, \"I wonder what you look like in the morning?\"' </p> <p>Roland says: 'You have to ask yourself, what line has been crossed here? Because obviously a line has been crossed.' He found e-romance pleasurably clandestine (emailers typically behave as if engaged in espionage). 'I was very aware that A was out with friends and was slipping away to a terminal to send me a few comments.' </p> <p>In the movie You've Got Mail , Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan exploit the incognito drama of email romance. They play business rivals who meet in an internet chat-room and then start a cyber affair_ It is only after they meet that the dime drops. </p> <p>Roland and Anna used to write '30,000 words' between them in a single week. But Anna's emails were, Roland sees now, full of little signs of doubt about the form. She finished one with: 'I wish you could see the way I sign my name, the way I do my A's.' In another, she wrote: 'I wonder if we'd get on so well if were in the same room.' </p> <p>Another friend, romancing on the net, revels in the flirtatious punctuation to her day and points out that emails are 'nonchalant, off the cuff. The medium lends itself to irony which helps to make things seem light'. It is not always possible to keep things light: one in 10 computer users surveyed have ended a relationship by email. </p> <p>When you are in love, perhaps netiquette does not count. But Roland was warned from the outset by his university that people might not recognise nuances so that if he was cracking jokes in emails , he should always put a colon, a dash and a closed parenthesis to indicate a smiling face. There is also what he calls an 'eyebrow-raised smiley' which looks like this - ;-) - 'If you suspect that a comment may be a little off-colour, you put that at the end. It is as if acknowledging that it might be off colour were a way to cancel its objectionable nature.' </p> <p>In the same way there is a symbol to try and defuse anger. It is horribly easy to reply too quickly to an email and fire off something you will later regret. This is known by some as a 'flare'. It is suggested that if you want to write something angry, you preface it with the words: 'Flame On'. I personally think this is as idiotic as waving a bunsen burner around while having a row. As Stephen Pritchard, The Observer 's letters editor, crisply points out, if you need symbols, it is a sign that you are not writing clearly enough. Roland agrees but adds: 'It seems that you can't count on anyone to understand the dead stream of characters.' </p> <p>Rosamund Heartgood, a financial journalist, would be surprised to hear that e-love is alive, let alone well. She believes 'the romance with email is over. The illusion that email is a new way of communicating has gone.' The more emails people get, the more they 'dread signing on. People are beginning to withdraw from email'. She goes further: 'It is a very bad way of communicating because we haven't learnt how to use it. It is a hybrid between writing and the telephone. We use it like the telephone, colloquially, but forget that people cannot hear our tone of voice.' She argues that 'friendships can easily deteriorate through email correspondence'. She warns against writing thank-you letters by email: '\"Thanks for lunch, we had a good time\", sounds grumpy and offhand.' </p> <p>Her advice: 'When in doubt, try a bit harder, lay it on a bit thicker or the emotional message may get lost.' She is contemptuous of colleagues (usually male) who use 'email as a kind of power tool, all abbreviations and capital letters, to suggest that they are too busy to press the shift key down'. She believes you should never use email to convey anything negative. 'It is cowardly and will almost certainly backfire on you.' </p> <p>I remember the loud quality of the silence in the office when people first started to gossip by email. It is a hazardous business. Email encourages Freudian slips (copying to the wrong people, for example). Rosamund once wrote an email about her editor. It contained what she intended be an amusing parody of a recent conversation she had had with him. She was a little concerned when the colleague she emailed it to did not laugh. </p> <p>Suddenly, she realised what she had done: she had sent it to the editor by mistake. Now she counsels: 'A good rule of thumb is that unless a message has to be instant: wait until the next day.' And her last rule is to sign off simply. </p> <p> That's it. ;-)</p>",

I've often wondered whether there was a techie version of Nancy Mitford (an idea that would have made her swoon with distaste) who could supply us with the 'u and non u' of email, the 'e and non-e'? And now, incredibly, it seems that there is. Step forward Rolf Kurth of Debrett's. He intends to come to our rescue - and evidently we need rescuing. According to recent research (for the email provider MSN Hotmail), email is promoting rampant illiteracy. Non-letter writers are said to be offending in cyberspace with amorous sign-offs (to professional emails), hasty kisses and cavalier misspellings. These people do not know how to mind their e's (or queues). Netiquette is a touchy business. Not least of all because no one can agree on what it is. Unfortunately, Kurth, author of Debrett's Guide to Correspondence, proves a disappointment. He conservatively insists on preserving good writing as a form of politeness. This does not help me at all. When I write an email, I feel like a foxed beginner. If I treat an email as if it were a letter - in a style that Debrett's might pass - it seems arduous, futile, gawkily dated. I feel like the uncomfortable possessor of a tie at a picnic, or someone transfixed by nostalgia for an epistolary past (for 'snail mail'). Should I skip 'Dear X' and crack straight on with the message? Should I scrap upper case and dash ahead with lower-case panache to show myself a proper mistress of the form? What is the best tone to adopt? One thing is for sure: literature and emails do not get on together, as last week's cautionary tale about poet laureate Andrew Motion illustrated. Laura Fish, a novelist on a one-year creative-writing course at UEA, accused Motion (her tutor) of harassment; she claimed to have received 40 'explicit' emails from him. He has returned the accusation and has also been reported saying that he does not expect his emails to appear in any collected letters. I fear for his biography. But I am sure he is right to be dismissive about his emails. They are - almost always - inferior to letters. It is like writing on water. Emails beg to be deleted (save or print only if you must). Email invites informality, speed and jocularity. The 'subject' line asks for a witticism (tiresome, if your message is not intended to amuse). As one of my friends observes 'for some people the title/subject seems to be the key to the whole thing; they get thousands of emails and only bother with the enticing come-ons . For others, the come-ons are more than enticing. I have a friend who is an English philosophy professor working in the States. Let us call him Roland. He embraced email with zealous enthusiasm before any of his English friends had any experience of it. He fell in love, via a prodigious email correspondence, with another academic whom he had met fleetingly at a conference. A 'seed was sown' which flowered on the net. Now, he remembers the time (1994) as 'heady'. There was a liberating sense that, through email, you could 'be anything you liked'. Email, he points out, is particularly good for people who can be 'quite shy and hopeless face to face'. For the first couple of days, the emails between Roland and A (let us call her Anna) were flat - then 'suddenly this thing caught fire'. He found the speed 'really exciting. It's great when you're on a good footing - you have just had your thirteenth email, so immediately you send off a reply. Instead of waiting for the second post, you could be expectant all the time.' In a new relationship you would never write a love letter every day, let alone 13 times a day, nor would you 'phone to chat idly about breakfast or muse, \"I wonder what you look like in the morning?\"' Roland says: 'You have to ask yourself, what line has been crossed here? Because obviously a line has been crossed.' He found e-romance pleasurably clandestine (emailers typically behave as if engaged in espionage). 'I was very aware that A was out with friends and was slipping away to a terminal to send me a few comments.' In the movie You've Got Mail , Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan exploit the incognito drama of email romance. They play business rivals who meet in an internet chat-room and then start a cyber affair_ It is only after they meet that the dime drops. Roland and Anna used to write '30,000 words' between them in a single week. But Anna's emails were, Roland sees now, full of little signs of doubt about the form. She finished one with: 'I wish you could see the way I sign my name, the way I do my A's.' In another, she wrote: 'I wonder if we'd get on so well if were in the same room.' Another friend, romancing on the net, revels in the flirtatious punctuation to her day and points out that emails are 'nonchalant, off the cuff. The medium lends itself to irony which helps to make things seem light'. It is not always possible to keep things light: one in 10 computer users surveyed have ended a relationship by email. When you are in love, perhaps netiquette does not count. But Roland was warned from the outset by his university that people might not recognise nuances so that if he was cracking jokes in emails , he should always put a colon, a dash and a closed parenthesis to indicate a smiling face. There is also what he calls an 'eyebrow-raised smiley' which looks like this - ;-) - 'If you suspect that a comment may be a little off-colour, you put that at the end. It is as if acknowledging that it might be off colour were a way to cancel its objectionable nature.' In the same way there is a symbol to try and defuse anger. It is horribly easy to reply too quickly to an email and fire off something you will later regret. This is known by some as a 'flare'. It is suggested that if you want to write something angry, you preface it with the words: 'Flame On'. I personally think this is as idiotic as waving a bunsen burner around while having a row. As Stephen Pritchard, The Observer 's letters editor, crisply points out, if you need symbols, it is a sign that you are not writing clearly enough. Roland agrees but adds: 'It seems that you can't count on anyone to understand the dead stream of characters.' Rosamund Heartgood, a financial journalist, would be surprised to hear that e-love is alive, let alone well. She believes 'the romance with email is over. The illusion that email is a new way of communicating has gone.' The more emails people get, the more they 'dread signing on. People are beginning to withdraw from email'. She goes further: 'It is a very bad way of communicating because we haven't learnt how to use it. It is a hybrid between writing and the telephone. We use it like the telephone, colloquially, but forget that people cannot hear our tone of voice.' She argues that 'friendships can easily deteriorate through email correspondence'. She warns against writing thank-you letters by email: '\"Thanks for lunch, we had a good time\", sounds grumpy and offhand.' Her advice: 'When in doubt, try a bit harder, lay it on a bit thicker or the emotional message may get lost.' She is contemptuous of colleagues (usually male) who use 'email as a kind of power tool, all abbreviations and capital letters, to suggest that they are too busy to press the shift key down'. She believes you should never use email to convey anything negative. 'It is cowardly and will almost certainly backfire on you.' I remember the loud quality of the silence in the office when people first started to gossip by email. It is a hazardous business. Email encourages Freudian slips (copying to the wrong people, for example). Rosamund once wrote an email about her editor. It contained what she intended be an amusing parody of a recent conversation she had had with him. She was a little concerned when the colleague she emailed it to did not laugh. Suddenly, she realised what she had done: she had sent it to the editor by mistake. Now she counsels: 'A good rule of thumb is that unless a message has to be instant: wait until the next day.' And her last rule is to sign off simply. That's it. ;-)",

'But I prefer to concentrate on one character at a time. I'm not like Steve Coogan, I don't like to play several parts in one show. Brian's in this to introduce him to John's fans, but I don't plan to have them appearing together in the future. They don't really belong - Brian's world is much more seedy.'(Brian drops in a reference to smoking dope - a world apart from Shuttleworth's staple topics of camping and pigeons.) </p> <p>Certainly Shuttleworth's enduring appeal is in the gentleness of his humour, which has more in common with Victoria Wood's style of character comedy than Coogan's, which has a crueller edge. One Foot in the Gravy works as an extended monologue of tangentially related anecdotes and songs, linked this time with the topical hook of natural disasters plaguing the country. </p> <p>'The show's not really about gravy,' Shuttleworth announces at the beginning, and goes on to point out that foot and mouth will shortly make gravy redundant - 'except for chips and gravy for students'. Then there are the difficulties with rail travel - 'because there have been some terrible crashes lately. And it makes it worse because they don't do leaf tea any more, do they?' But his main preoccupation is the imminent return of the floods, to which end he produced a series of useful diagrams showing how his car porch can be transformed into a jetty, and which lead into a series of phone calls that allow Fellows to bring in some of the other characters familiar from the radio series - John's wife Mary and his agent, Ken Worthington (he of the famous Cuban heels). </p> <p>Interacting on stage with pre-recorded material presents its own hazards, but technical kinks seemed to have been ironed out by the first night of the tour; there are one or two moments where Fellows appears to forget the lyrics to his own songs, but you can never quite be sure - the Shuttleworth mannerisms offer a very good cover for line fluffing. </p> <p>'A lot of the material I don't even write,' Fellows explains. 'They're just stories people tell me, or things I overhear my children saying, or observations from the small town where I live in Lincoln. But when I give them to John and set them in Sheffield, it makes Sheffield sound quainter, more small-town than it really is.' </p> <p>Brian Appleton, who will have his own Radio 4 series in September after a three-week run at Edinburgh, opens the second half with a Morrissey pastiche entitled 'It's My Turn to be Poorly'. Fellows explains that he's using Brian in this show partly to try out new songs. Brian gets the laughs, but with a certain amount of caution; it's apparent that the audience, clearly part of Shuttleworth's extensive cult following, will take some converting when you witness the applause that greets the favourite songs they can sing along to: 'Austin Ambassador Y Reg', or Shuttleworth's Eurovision entry, 'Pigeons in Flight'. </p> <p>Alongside Alan Partridge, Shuttleworth is contemporary character comedy at its finest. Though Brian Appleton may inherit Shuttleworth's fans, you can't help feeling he will be hard to replace. Since his valedictory tour is already selling out fast, you'd be well advised to see him before he morphs into Brian Appleton for good.</p>",

Brian Appleton, who will have his own Radio 4 series in September after a three-week run at Edinburgh, opens the second half with a Morrissey pastiche entitled 'It's My Turn to be Poorly'. Fellows explains that he's using Brian in this show partly to try out new songs. Brian gets the laughs, but with a certain amount of caution; it's apparent that the audience, clearly part of Shuttleworth's extensive cult following, will take some converting when you witness the applause that greets the favourite songs they can sing along to: 'Austin Ambassador Y Reg', or Shuttleworth's Eurovision entry, 'Pigeons in Flight'. Alongside Alan Partridge, Shuttleworth is contemporary character comedy at its finest. Though Brian Appleton may inherit Shuttleworth's fans, you can't help feeling he will be hard to replace. Since his valedictory tour is already selling out fast, you'd be well advised to see him before he morphs into Brian Appleton for good.",

It's not exactly that design was an unwilling victim. Furniture designers had been hanging about for ages hoping to get noticed. They have always hankered after a bit of the kind of stardom that comes with fashion. Even as they laboured away at the humbler necessities of domestic life, they secretly hankered for paparazzi, stretch limos, MTV and all that attention. But, when design finally turned into fashion at the Milan furniture fair last week, it turned out not to be nearly as much fun as they had been hoping. </p> <p>Milan's furniture fair has always billed itself as doing for the living-room what the Paris collections do for the wardrobe. In a sense, it's true. Hundreds of manufacturers from all over the world converge on the city for five days in April every year. There is an exhibition centre the size of a city, crammed with hall after hall of everything from high tech to high kitsch. Scores of designers, from Ron Arad to Philippe Starck, flock there for an endless round of alcohol-fuelled parties. It's a cross between the Cannes Film Festival and Fashion Week in Paris in which, incongruously enough, the focus of attention is not next season's blockbuster from Spielberg or the new McQueen collection, but a sofa or a book-shelf. </p> <p>This is where the retail buyers come to find the mass-market knock-offs of the previous year's successful new launches and where the designers come to show off. If there is anywhere that dictates whether we will be putting carpet on our floors or leaving them bare, or choosing fluorescent pink for our walls rather than white, this is it. Until now, however, it has all been a private little fantasy. The designers played at being stars for a week and then went back to real life. </p> <p>But now Milanese design has acquired all the trappings of grown-up celebrity. Armani and Fendi have suddenly got interested in furniture. There are mob scenes at opening parties with heavy-duty security. Stands showing collections of sofas hide behind the kind of thick red rope favoured by nightclubs with aggressive door policies. Matthew Hilton's Balzac armchairs sit in Paul Smith's new shop on the Via Manzoni, upholstered for the occasion in pinstripe material. There are even stalkers. Somebody has been making the rounds of the fringe events at the fair putting up stickers that read 'Kill All Arrogant Designers'. </p> <p>The fashion names have been putting their signatures on homeware collections ever since the 1960s, when Pierre Cardin started licensing himself to all-comers with the abandon of a hyper-inflationary banker. This is different. The shift is really in the way that the designers work. They make collections the way that fashion designers would, trying to put across a mood or an attitude, rather than worrying too much about comfort or function. They try to tap the same kind of dreams and fantasies that fashion does. </p> <p>In exactly the same way that fashion is now recycling the 1970s, so is design. But the design world is still in denial. 'I don't believe in fashion designers trying to make furniture, just as I am not convinced about furniture makers who try to be fashion designers,' says Giulio Cappellini, Milan's most high-profile furniture manufacturer. But that hasn't stopped him from investing heavily in a collection of chairs, tables, sofas and desks designed by Fabien Baron, who is better known as an art director of glossy magazines and Calvin Klein advertisements than for his intimate knowledge of the finer points of injection-moulded plastics. </p> <p>He is, however, pretty good at turning out a distinctive blend of sex and minimalism. To cover all the stylistic bases, Cappellini has also ransacked the Emilio Pucci archive and is putting his chairs in fabrics of a vividness not seen since the days of psychedelic paint jobs on the Minis of Swinging London. And Cappellini is not the only company at it. At Edra, Massimo Morrozzi, who commissioned the designers who work for the company, is happy to say that he has worked exactly as if he were a fashion stylist: 'What makes fashion so interesting is its ability to communicate to people directly, whereas we designers are locked in a hermetic world of our own'. </p> <p>Edra has found its very own vintage 1960s prints from Ken Scott's archive and is applying them to everything in its range that hasn't been coloured pink. </p> <p>Fabien Baron is not the only designer from outside the conventional world of furniture design to make a mark in Milan this year. It is possible to construct an almost complete John Pawson world in Milan. You can sit at a Pawson table made by Driade; cook on a Pawson-designed kitchen; wash your hands in a Pawson-designed sink; put flowers in a Pawson-designed vase; and keep your photographs in a Pawson-designed picture frame. </p> <p>Together, it adds up to a complete world view. It's not fashion but, like fashion, it offers the possibility of a readymade approach to life. In Pawson's hands, it is a dream of simplicity and the impossible fantasy of being able to find the perfect object. As fantasies go, it has got more going for it than dreaming of the Playboy bachelor pads that Cappellini is so lovingly recreating.</p>",

The drama takes place in a Leeds hotel room occupied by repulsive journalist Ian (first line: 'I've shat in better places than this') and his ingenuous former girlfriend Cate. They spar uneasily until the entrance of a soldier carrying a machine gun. England has been invaded or riven by a coup and the horror to come includes Ian being raped, having his eyes bitten out and being impelled to consume a dead baby as he starves, alone, in the dark. Some of the experiences described by the soldier are worse than anything we witness. </p> <p>First time round, the Mail and Telegraph stopped just short of calling on the Government to declare a national state of emergency in the face of such unpleasantness. Had Jack Straw then been Home Secretary, the Government might very well have obliged.

You're often unsure whether they're laughing or crying on stage and Kane's singular gift as a dramatist is to make you, the audience, feel like doing both at the same time. For all the carnage and its grim logic, I've never laughed as much at Stoppard or Ayckbourn. There's nothing gratuitous here at all. </p> <p>Regular readers will know that this isn't my normal job and most friends greeted the news that I would be tackling Ibsen, Kane and George Eliot on consecutive days as if it were an announcement that Dame Judi Dench had finally agreed to remove my appendix. </p> <p>Indeed, by Monday, sloping past the cinemas and music venues and pubs blaring European football on my way to The Comedy Theatre and Ibsen's Ghosts, I did wonder at my wisdom in accepting this mission. Kneeling at the feet of a classic such as this, the traditional theatre audience can seem like an unusually well-spoken cult, such as you might find in a Lars Von Trier Dogme film, the irony here being that Ghosts caused more controversy when it opened more than a century ago than Sarah Kane - or indeed Eminem - ever has. </p> <p>For Ibsen, Ghosts was part of a cycle of 12 'dramas of contemporary life' and the fuss was over its espousal of passion over duty, which a Victorian audience read as a call to nihilism. That the vehicle for such a message should be a woman, who dutifully forsakes her (very much requited) love for the self-deluding Pastor Manders in order to save a sham of a marriage to a cruel hypocrite of a man, made matters worse. Ibsen's point is that propriety and convention are instruments of control, which stifle the spirit and lead to misery. This will still be news in some regions of Surrey, meaning that Robin Phillips's orderly production - in period costume before a clever set that is all angle and reflection - retains power and relevance. Francesca Annis simmers as Mrs Helena Alving and Anthony Andrews, as the uptight Pastor, wears a face such as you might see on a basset hound attempting to squeeze the juice from a lemon using only his buttocks, which was strangely redolent of watching Jeremy Paxman on Newsnight. I'm not sure whether this added to the drama. </p> <p>George Eliot was working with similar themes in The Mill on the Floss at about the same time as Ibsen, but Shared Experience, returning with Helen Edmundson's previously acclaimed and quite, quite brilliant adaptation, make something entirely different out of them. Through inspired use of movement, sharp, witty dialogue, a spare set and talented cast, the company conjure a dream-like atmosphere that is at once gritty and magical. </p> <p>What's more, the dramatic device of using three different actresses to play Maggie as the spirited child, the dutifully repressed adult and the eventual resolution of the two helps to generalise her story and lend it a contemporary edge. She is a downtrodden Victorian woman. She also embodies the timeless battle between the id and superego, with her brother Tom undergoing a parallel journey of his own. </p> <p>The impressionistic flood sequence at the end is stunningly imagined and immensely moving.

      "body": "<p><strong> Houston Ballet</strong> Sadler's Wells, WC2 </p> <p> Titter ye not. Cleopatra has sailed into town, with a retinue of Texan supporters prepared to applaud anything: Cleo's barge, Ptolemy's ptantrums, Caesar's athletic assassination, the writhing rubber asp. </p> <p>There's a culture clash here. Americans (in spite of A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum) don't have an inbuilt music-hall response to olden times. We see a sandpit, a pyramid and people in headdresses moving sideways and we think Frankie Howerd, Monty Python, Wilson, Keppel and Betty: Americans think Cecil B. de Mille. If Antony's outfit exposes short, hairy legs, we know he's Ernie Wise, yet this ballet takes his antics seriously. </p> <p>Ben Stevenson, Houston Ballet's director and principal choreographer for 25 years, is an Englishman. So he must have wagered that his cast's commitment would quell any sniggers from his compatriots. After all, we enjoy the Kirov's Le Corsaire, whose plot and exotic locations are even sillier than Cleopatra's. The difference is that the Kirov relish sending up Petipa's 1899 pirate extravaganza because it is part of their heritage. They can perform its demanding choreography with affectionate familiarity. </p> <p>Houston's dancers have to be deadly earnest, even as they semaphore their emotions with angular arms and jutting chins. Egyptian handmaidens pose in hieroglyphic friezes; Cleopatra struts on pointe, then flexes her feet in imperious disdain. The leading role was created for Lauren Anderson, a dancer of power and dignity. Her dark skin and glamorous costumes (all seven of them) accentuate her allure for the colonising Romans, who wear passion-killing underpants beneath their kilts and togas. </p> <p>Stevenson may be making a political point about the unworthiness of both Caesar and Mark Antony to be Cleopatra's lovers. Timothy O'Keefe and Dominic Walsh look so ungainly as partners that Anderson's sensuality seems misplaced. She gives herself wholeheartedly to the choreography, which never allows her to be truly expansive: keeping Egyptian angles in mid-air is pretty inhibiting. </p> <p>The music, John Lanchbery's arrangement of extracts from Rimsky-Korsakov ballets and operas, sounds like the score of a generic Desert Song musical. Stevenson's choreography is serviceable without being inspired.

      "bodyText": "Houston Ballet Sadler's Wells, WC2 Titter ye not. Cleopatra has sailed into town, with a retinue of Texan supporters prepared to applaud anything: Cleo's barge, Ptolemy's ptantrums, Caesar's athletic assassination, the writhing rubber asp. There's a culture clash here. Americans (in spite of A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum) don't have an inbuilt music-hall response to olden times. We see a sandpit, a pyramid and people in headdresses moving sideways and we think Frankie Howerd, Monty Python, Wilson, Keppel and Betty: Americans think Cecil B. de Mille. If Antony's outfit exposes short, hairy legs, we know he's Ernie Wise, yet this ballet takes his antics seriously. Ben Stevenson, Houston Ballet's director and principal choreographer for 25 years, is an Englishman. So he must have wagered that his cast's commitment would quell any sniggers from his compatriots. After all, we enjoy the Kirov's Le Corsaire, whose plot and exotic locations are even sillier than Cleopatra's. The difference is that the Kirov relish sending up Petipa's 1899 pirate extravaganza because it is part of their heritage. They can perform its demanding choreography with affectionate familiarity. Houston's dancers have to be deadly earnest, even as they semaphore their emotions with angular arms and jutting chins. Egyptian handmaidens pose in hieroglyphic friezes; Cleopatra struts on pointe, then flexes her feet in imperious disdain. The leading role was created for Lauren Anderson, a dancer of power and dignity. Her dark skin and glamorous costumes (all seven of them) accentuate her allure for the colonising Romans, who wear passion-killing underpants beneath their kilts and togas. Stevenson may be making a political point about the unworthiness of both Caesar and Mark Antony to be Cleopatra's lovers. Timothy O'Keefe and Dominic Walsh look so ungainly as partners that Anderson's sensuality seems misplaced. She gives herself wholeheartedly to the choreography, which never allows her to be truly expansive: keeping Egyptian angles in mid-air is pretty inhibiting. The music, John Lanchbery's arrangement of extracts from Rimsky-Korsakov ballets and operas, sounds like the score of a generic Desert Song musical. Stevenson's choreography is serviceable without being inspired. There is a caution about letting rip that constrains his best effects, including a homoerotic duet for the boy-pharaoh Ptolemy and his regent, Pothinus. Maybe family audiences back home resist too much grit in their ancient lays of Egypt and Rome. A triple-bill on Wednesday showed off the dancers in recent works by two Australians, Natalie Weir and Stanton Welsh, and former company member Trey McIntyre. All three are making their names on the international circuit, where, let's face it, competition is not strong. Welsh sees the Houston bunch as prize-fighters in last year's Bruiser . This is heroic Twyla Tharp territory and Welsh hasn't the choreographic stamina to go the distance. Weir's In A Whisper features a window, a chair and the end of an affair. A man (Dominic Walsh) seems to want what he can't have: could be the ideal girl or boy, drugs or poetry. In Second Before The Ground, McIntyre treats contemporary African music as though it were Country and Western. The result is a hyperactive hoe-down with romantic interludes: lightweight fun for a likeable company that is not yet a major contender.",

The only difference is that painters are lucky - everyone knows their medium has had it, so they can pick over the relics in peace. But filmmakers? They continue in wilful denial, refusing to accept that every idea, every innovation, effect or style has long since been done to death. Abetted by our blind love of movies, they keep turning out the same old product: plots retold, shots rehashed, features too long by about 90 minutes. </p> <p>These are the opinions of Mark Lewis, the Canadian-born, London-based artist. They apply to any bad night at the Odeon, of course - but Lewis is more concerned with the death of the avant-garde, its exequies exhaustively directed by Jean-Luc Godard. Lewis also makes films about filmmaking, working in 35mm with a professional cast and crew. But his pieces are mercifully short - not longer than five minutes at the most - and they come to praise, not bury the inventions of cinema. Which, incidentally, do not include sound since it is only added in post-production. 'There is nothing,' he argues, 'inherent in the process of film that actually necessitates sound.' </p> <p>Lewis, it may be confidently predicted, turns out to be an old-fashioned purist, in love with the visual - the zoom, the pan, the slow track - and bored by character and plot. His method is to select a convention unique to cinema, often quite a rudimentary operation, which he then isolates on screen without the amniotic fluid of narrative. This is easier to do in an art gallery, where nobody is expecting Spielberg. The downside is that the audience still has to be sufficiently fascinated to stay until the final credits. </p> <p>Lewis is very good at endings. In A Sense of the End he films six alternative endings in long shot - the man rushing to catch up with the train that bears the woman away; the gunshot victim faltering and finally collapsing in an urban wasteland. Each conclusion functions as a kind of film-without-a-film: pure climax that requires no build-up. Lewis makes a similar feature of opening titles. Two Impossible Films is based on a pair of projects that were never made: Eisenstein's movie of Marx's Kapital and Sam Goldwyn's absurd fantasy of filming the complete works of Freud. Lewis shoots only the opening and closing credits. The rest, apparently, is summarised in laconic storyboards - 'Plot Development, 'Temporary Resolution' and so forth. Only in dream or theory could such texts ever be realised as drama. </p> <p>I say apparently because Two Impossible Films is sadly not included in Lewis' exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in Oxford. Nor, I'm afraid, is the excellent A Sense of the End, made in 1996. The six films on show are more recent and austere, almost fundamentalist in their attitude to cinema. They are for people who like to analyse the language of movies, to admire the long take, the jump-cut, the over-the-building shot: people who prefer to study films on video, using the freeze-frame and replay of a remote control. </p> <p> North Circular, for example, opens with a distant shot of a gutted office block backlit against a violet-tinged sky. Some children move in the interior shadows, disrupting the static image. The camera glides lazily up on its crane, like a bird buoyed up on a thermal current. Gradually it peaks and descends to peer through a window, where a top is spinning on a table. That's all. No pressure of event, no mystery, no beginning or end, since the film is on continuous loop. You could get the same pleasure from any crane-shot in a Hitchcock movie - but you'd have to put up with so much in the way of thrilling action and plot. </p> <p>In Centrale, an incident almost takes place between two characters waiting in a street. The woman is talking quite sociably to the man although he pays her no attention whatsoever. After a few anxious seconds, you realise he isn't even facing her - the camera is filming two scenes at once with the aid of a cunningly angled mirror. I guess this is a lesson in legibility: how we read speech and body language in the absence of sound. But aside from the sense of what deafness must be like, this optical trick doesn't convey more than can be learnt from the daily business of looking. </p> <p>Perhaps that is all Lewis really wants - to slow the eye down to its essential function. In Smithfields , he sends a camera gliding back and forth round a glass-sided building by night. You watch the cleaner washing the floor inside. You get on close terms with the architecture and the multiple reflections. It is rhythmically monotonous for about two soothing minutes - at which point the film concludes. According to the catalogue, Lewis is experimenting with the single-reel shot as pioneered by the Lumi\u00e8re brothers. But you can't help wondering if he feels bound by the same imperative as the Hollywood mogul - never to bore the audience. </p> <p>The most elaborate piece in this show is Upside Down Touch of Evil, a meticulous reconstruction of the long opening sequence of Orson Welles's movie, shot in silence - except for the bomb blast that triggers the plot - and with the camera inverted. I don't know why Lewis has done this. It doesn't add to the spatial qualities of Welles's great tracking shot as it follows Charlton Heston and Janet Leigh along curving pavements, across tramlines and beneath the streetlights of the evening city. Nor does it destroy the suspense, since anyone watching the timer applied to the bomb - even upside down - is braced for the explosion to go off. </p> <p>Invert an image and you raise a question: why is this not the right way up? The answer, in this case, is a little to do with alienation - looking at a famous film with new eyes - and a lot to do with formal abstraction. Josef von Sternberg is said to have rued the fact that he couldn't edit his movies upside down, so the plot wouldn't interfere with the aesthetic. If Lewis had fixed on Hitchcock, say, like so many other contemporary artists, he might have decoupled aesthetic from plot with this expensive inversion. But Welles's melodrama remains intact, even when enacted on the ceiling. </p> <p>The best film in this show is the only one that doesn't try to segregate the techniques we all notice perfectly well, even when supposedly scanted and sidelined by the narrative thrust of a movie. In The Pitch , Lewis films himself on a crowded public concourse, conducting a persuasive monologue about the role of the extra - the over-looked proletariat of the film set, always in the background of history. Noting that there is no equivalent in any other art form, Lewis pitches the idea of a film entirely cast with extras - shoppers, travellers, drunks, people who animate the scene with their silent reactions. As he speaks, the camera pans slowly back to take in the bystanding crowds - who have unwittingly become stars of the very film, brief and brilliant, that Lewis has been shooting all along.</p>",

Back in 1992, Britpop had yet to be identified as a musical movement.

With its juxtaposition of rap, funk, blues and soul, the record successfully amalgamated a British club culture then coming to the forefront of pop music. And with their multiracial line-up, the group were indicative of the much-heralded buzz word -'multiculturalism'. </p> <p>Nine years on from Connected and seven years since their last live shows, however, Stereo MC's have only just resurfaced from their hiatus.

Standing behind him, in a blaze of colourful clothing, a battery of flamboyantly dressed backing singers and musicians provide a carnival atmosphere - and within minutes of the group taking to the stage, Stereo MC's bring to mind all the hallmarks of a Parliament gig. </p> <p>If, as in recent interviews, the group have maintained that they have laboured for the past eight years on a follow-up to Connected , writing and eventually junking about 400 songs, there seems to be little evidence of writer's block on their new material. The title track from their forthcoming album, 'Low Down and Dirty', with a bass line that shares much in common with early Bomb the Bass, shows the group still have an understanding of contemporary music. And 'Traffic', arguably the standout track from the new album, quickly affirms itself as a live favourite - with its skewed beats and gruff chants. </p> <p>Thankfully, the group have decided to not disown their past. 'Ground Level' and 'Step It Up' still sound as fresh as ever - and even 'Connected', once so irritatingly used to promote a brand of mobile phones, has been transformed into the backbone of their live set. That song, in particular, now augmented by extra keyboards, proves the highlight of this eagerly anticipated concert. </p> <p>The group's long absence doesn't really seem to have hurt them at all.

      "bodyText": "New rights for mothers choosing to work part-time will be drawn up by an independent commission under plans being considered by Tony Blair. In an appeal to women voters, Labour is expected to back 'flexible working' in its election manifesto. But Downing Street, wary of a backlash from business, is seeking a compromise over calls for a legally enforceable right for women to reduce their hours after giving birth. The Prime Minister is locked in negotiations over whether the right should be compulsory or merely voluntary best practice for employers. One option is to propose new rights but promise that details of what they would include and when they would take effect would be left to an independent commission involving employers. Downing Street has already privately promised business leaders that there will be no new employment rights legislation for two years. 'This is the most important issue for most women at work - control over their hours - but it is also a huge challenge to business,' said Harriet Harman, the former Cabinet Minister who has been working closely on the proposals. 'My view is that we are likely to solve this problem. We don't want to ditch this, because it is too important, but neither will we charge headfirst into a row with business that can be avoided.' Research suggests many new mothers reluctantly give up work because they cannot juggle a full-time job and a baby, when they could have returned successfully from maternity leave had they been able to work part-time. A survey by the Equal Opportunities Commission found half of new mothers who sought to reduce their hours were refused. A legal right to flexible working was first floated by the Women's Ministers Baroness Jay and Tessa Jowell, and taken up by Trade Secretary Stephen Byers in a recent Green Paper. Business protests convinced many at Westminster that the idea would be shelved. However, senior fig ures point out that business leaders fiercely opposed the minimum wage but now accept it. The creation of the independent Low Pay Commission to set a rate was pivotal in reassuring them, a tactic that could be repeated for flexible working. The issue has divided Downing Street's policy unit, with Geoff Norris, Blair's industry adviser, and Lord Haskins, the Labour-supporting tycoon who advises the Government on red tape, said to be resisting new legal rights. But Byers, Jay, Jowell, junior Employment Minister Margaret Hodge and policy unit adviser Carey Oppenheim have argued in favour. The decision is now said to be in the balance, but retreat risks a backlash from women voters already showing greater signs than men of disillusionment with Labour. Meanwhile the issue of working parents will rise up the political agenda on the eve of the election campaign, with Cherie Booth due to challenge her husband's Government over parental leave. She is due in court for the TUC next month to argue that millions of parents have been wrongly excluded from the promise of three months' unpaid time off. TUC general secretary John Monks called yesterday for the Government not to be 'so frightened' of business. The unions want unpaid parental leave - currently limited to those with children born after 15 December 1999 - extended to another 2.7 million parents of under-fives born before that date. Its case, led by Booth, will be heard by the European Court of Justice on 3 May. 'We do not understand why the Government is dragging out this case - every expert expects them to lose,' said Monks. 'You would think Ministers would see this as an ideal opportunity to demonstrate their child-friendly credentials before the election.' It is not the first time Booth has appeared in court against the Government - she uses the 'cab rank' principle of taking whichever cases come along - and famously appeared for the TUC weeks before giving birth to her son Leo. This case, however, falls at a particularly sensitive time.",

Ashcroft raised \u00a342m this month by selling an additional one million shares in Tyco. antony.barnett@observer.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>Crystal Ferguson lives in a poor neighbourhood in north Charleston, South Carolina. Her home is a prefab, single-storey structure surrounded by a miniature, once-white picket fence, a parody of middle America. Inside the cramped house sausages are frying for her daughters Annika, nine, and four-year-old Hilary. A bombastic preacher on a religious radio programme praises the Lord over and over. On a shabby desk an old, yellowed bible lies open at chapter 15 of Jeremiah: 'And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked. And I will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible.' Ferguson is tall, fleshless and striking, her cheekbones sharp, her strong eyes flashing suspicion.</p> <p>She gestures towards the radio. 'My mother is dead, but my foster momma, who raised me, told me to get on my knees and ask the Lord to take the taste for those drugs out of my mouth. I'm trying to keep on the right path, I'm working long hours at a cleaning company so I can provide for my kids. And anyone who comes calling with drugs I say, \"Leave that stuff outside on the front porch.\"'</p> <p>There are times when drugs have blighted Crystal's life. Alcohol and marijuana were her preferences, but it was when she started smoking joints laced with cocaine that she collided with the authorities. She smoked while she was pregnant with Annika in 1991 and sought prenatal care at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC). Hospital staff tested her urine for drugs without her knowledge or consent around the time she gave birth, then passed the results on to the police. Annika was born on 4 August 1991, and the next day head nurse Shirley Brown came to her hospital bedside and broke the news that she had to go into treatment.</p> <p>'Nurse Shirley Brown came into my room, looked at Annika, and said: \"Another one of you. You won't be taking this one home because you tested positive for cocaine.\" I was lucky because I didn't lose my baby, but I know some women who lost theirs to this policy and then lost their minds, started committing all sorts of crimes and ended up in jail. I was strong. I said to Shirley Brown, \"No way in the world am I going to walk out of your hospital without my baby, no ma'am. When I leave, my baby leaves with me.\"'</p> <p>She still shudders at Brown's reference to 'you people', branding Ferguson as part of a biological underclass. 'One doctor said my daughter would never be an A student because of what I'd done to her when I was pregnant, that I was no good and should have got my tubes tied instead of getting pregnant.</p> <p>'Trust me, nobody plans to keep using drugs when they are pregnant. I thought I'd be able to stop, but I couldn't. The last thing I needed to hear was that I was no good. I wish I could meet the doctor who said those cruel things to me because I'd like to tell him that for the past two years Annika has been nothing but a straight-A student.'</p> <p>A few days after her daughter was born, when Crystal was due to start the outpatient drug treatment, she was arrested for failing to agree to inpatient treatment. She was held in jail before her family managed to get her out on bail. Only after that was she allowed to start the outpatient drug-treatment programme. She cries noisily as she remembers how close she came to losing her daughter. Annika, a beautiful child with soft, wavy hair, looks across at her mother. 'I don't like to see her cry,' says Annika without flinching.</p> <p>Ferguson is one of 253 women who were pregnant or had just given birth who tested positive for drugs during a controversial six-year policy at MUSC. Because she was targeted when the programme was a few years old, she was offered drug treatment as an alternative to arrest, although the treatment was on the hospital's terms and disregarded the needs of the mothers-to-be, their new babies and older siblings.</p> <p>In the early months of the programme, women whose babies were due in a few weeks' time or those who had given birth just hours before were not offered treatment. Hospital staff passed on the results of their drug tests straight to the police in what critics have described as a 'law enforcement sting'. The women knew nothing of this policy until the police arrived at the hospital, arrested them for child abuse or distributing drugs to a minor and carried them out in shackles and chains. In some cases, the women were still bleeding from the birth; in others they were held in police cells until they went into labour and were then returned to the hospital and forced to give birth in chains.</p> <p>In 1993, 10 women sued the hospital - which has since dropped the practice - in a case known as Ferguson v City of Charleston. The women claimed that their federal rights were violated under the fourth amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches. A federal jury ruled against the women and the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the verdict in July 1999. Last September the case went to the US Supreme Court, the highest legal authority in the US. What concerns the 75 organisations which filed briefs supporting the women's case - health, women's and civil liberties groups - is not just what went on at one hospital in one state but what is going on all over America. Hundreds of women have been arrested on charges ranging from child abuse to homi cide for taking drugs while pregnant, drinking alcohol or even not taking enough bed rest. According to critics, the law is pitting mother against foetus.</p> <p>In one 1992 case in California, a woman who used drugs was charged with foetal homicide when her baby was stillborn. In another in Wisconsin in 1996, a woman who used alcohol during her pregnancy and had a stillbirth was charged with first-degree intentional homicide and reckless conduct. One pregnant woman was arrested for ordering a glass of wine. Wyndi Anderson of South Carolina Advocates For Pregnant Women is concerned about this erosion of women's civil rights. 'By setting up an adversarial relationship between the mother and foetus, we are going down a dangerous and slippery slope. Women with the least amount of resources and often large amounts of pain in their lives are expected to be better mothers than anyone else.'</p> <p>On the other side of town, right in the centre of historic Charleston, with its spacious, spotless streets and tall, elegant buildings, Bobby Hood, the lawyer representing the 28 people the case has been brought against - MUSC staff, the police who made the arrests and local prosecutors - drives us from his offices to his large 18th-century town house a few blocks away. 'Don't you need to wear a seatbelt here?' I ask him. He leans back and laughs genially. 'Ahh no. All the police know me. If they pull me over they'll just say: \"Hi Bobby, how're ya doin?\"' He asks what my interest in the case is, tells me that what he's really interested in right now is the upcoming turkey season, that he's got another 1,200-acre place in the country with hunting rights on the surrounding land, that Forrest Gump was filmed there and that he's just rushed back from there for this meeting and must take a shower before he poses for photographs.</p> <p>Hood points out that the women and their lawyers, 'those ladies from New York', have lost the case in the lower courts. 'I asked these women in court if MUSC's policy of arresting them had helped them get off drugs. They said it had. They wouldn't have got treatment otherwise, so you see we helped them. This is not a police state. We have not violated anyone's constitutional rights, least of all the baby in the woman's tummy. It's no big deal. The police officers who came to the hospital wore plain clothes and covered the women in a blanket after they'd chained their ankles so they couldn't run. One female officer stopped at Burger King after one of the women was arrested and bought her a burger out of her own money!'</p> <p>Then Hood's eyes mist over as he starts to talk about the state of babies born to drug-using mothers. 'It absolutely makes you cry to see those babies. You can hold a whole human being in your hand, it's the most pathetic sight you have ever seen. The nurses got tired of dressing these babies to go home for funerals. They tried to do something about it and the thanks they got was this lawsuit trying to get money for these women who are using drugs, which is a crime anyway. I have seen these children die or become teen criminals and commit crazy crimes because their brains have been messed up by drugs in the womb.</p> <p>'I voted for Bush because I believe he's going to make a great president and I know he would agree totally with what the hospital did because it was medically and socially right. These women are pathetic human beings, they lead pathetic lives, and they need help. The mother and the foetus both have rights, but society has a duty to protect the weaker of the two. The baby can't do anything about its momma using cocaine. To me, exposing a baby to drugs in the womb is no different from taking a pistol and shooting the baby right through the mother's stomach or taking a knife and sticking it in there.'</p> <p>Controversy surrounds the so-called 'crack babies' born in the late 80s and early 90s and the subject of much media interest. Contrary to reports, many of the women who tested positive for drugs at MUSC and elsewhere gave birth to healthy babies. When hospitals in New York adopted a policy of taking in all babies born to mothers using cocaine, they soon realised they'd made a mistake. They were inundated with nurseries full of babies, many of them healthy.</p> <p>While nobody advocates taking drugs during pregnancy (including the women in the Ferguson case), the harm caused by cocaine is being re-evaluated as just one risk factor, alongside the use of other drugs. Alcohol and cigarettes have caused more proven harm to babies, and a 1999 study found that poverty had more impact on the developing brain of the foetus than cocaine.</p> <p>The question is: does the 'shackles and chains' approach encourage drug-using pregnant women to seek help? At first Nurse Brown insisted that it did. In a report in 1993, she said the policy was working. However, she later admitted her data had no scientific basis.</p> <p>Mary Faith Marshall, an ethicist who worked at MUSC and testified against the hospital in court, questioned the medical value of this approach. 'The scientific evidence is that cocaine, compared to legal drugs such as alcohol and tobacco, has a very minor effect on foetal outcome.' She added that there was no evidence that the policy promoted healthy pregnancies; rather, it alienated a particular population of patients. Many medical groups believe that the way this policy violated doctor-patient confidentiality has serious implications. And recently the Southern Regional Project on infant mortality found that pregnant women who use drugs won't seek help if they feel that their doctors are going to turn them in to the police.</p> <p>Reuben Greenberg, Charleston police chief, is upbeat about his officers' involvement. He says they were simply upholding state law. 'If someone says a child has been abused, we have to investigate. We don't handcuff everyone, but in the judgment of my officers the women who were restrained needed to be restrained. An intelligent assessment of the risk was made.'</p> <p>Lynn Paltrow - a lawyer representing the 10 women, director of National Advocates for Pregnant Women and one of Hood's 'ladies from New York' - has worked on the case for many years, along with Susan Dunn, a Charleston lawyer. Paltrow is in Charleston for a weekend gathering with lawyers, advocates, activists and the women involved in the Supreme Court case. Sitting in the tranquil living room at the Wide Awake Plantation on the outskirts of town, tears stream down the faces of the women taking the case as they relive what happened to them at MUSC.</p> <p>Paltrow says that the policy has disproportionately targeted poor black women, a charge the hospital denies. 'This issue is about race, about anti-feminism and about America's war on drugs. Carrying black women out of the hospital in chains evokes images of slavery. This policy was never about protecting children - there was no follow-up for the children, no treatment for them despite the mythical claims of severe damage - it was all about punishing women.'</p> <p>The modern slavery Paltrow refers to has a history in South Carolina, the only US state which still flies the Confederate flag. Around one-third of the slaves who came to North America from African countries entered through Charleston and were quarantined in pens on Sullivan Island before they were sold at slave markets in the city. More recently, MUSC itself was the focus of a pivotal strike during the civil-rights era. In June 1969, 12 black union activists were dismissed. At the time the hospital had no black doctors or nurse students - all the black employees were low-paid nurses' aides and service workers. Bed and waiting-room arrangements for black and white patients were separate and while white husbands were allowed into the delivery room, black ones were not. In an echo of that era, Nurse Brown said that the mixing of the races was 'against God's way'. The majority of the women selected for drug testing were black. Of the 10 who have taken their case to the US Supreme Court, only one is white and Brown remarked in her notes that she had a 'Negro' boyfriend. The hospital declined to allow Brown to be interviewed, but Hood says she apologised for the remark about keeping blacks and whites apart, which she put down to the fact that she was 'brought up in a small Southern town'.</p> <p>South Carolina, which as a result of a state Supreme Court decision recognises a foetus of 24 weeks or more as a person, has taken some of the most extreme steps to police pregnant women, but other states have passed equally restrictive laws. In 1997, Wisconsin created a new category of unborn child abuse - a child becomes a human being at fertilisation. Paltrow says that under this law, 'a zealous police officer who observes a pregnant woman drinking cocktails at a bar may take the woman into immediate custody'.</p> <p>Deneen Clark, 36, lives in what she had always thought was the relatively liberal state of New Jersey. She is white and single and is planning to embark on a law degree later this year. For several years she has smoked cannabis for medicinal purposes - she says the drug relaxes her and without it she suffers acute and crippling anxiety attacks which are so severe she is unable to eat.</p> <p>She had lost two babies in the womb due to rare medical conditions and so when she became pregnant in 1998 she was overjoyed. But she was terrified of losing another baby. She discussed her cannabis use with her doctor, who said it was preferable to smoking cigarettes during pregnancy. On 28 December 1998 she gave birth to a son by Caesarean section. As soon as he was born, he was whisked away by nurses who said they needed to check him over. When she still had not seen her baby by 4pm, she panicked that there was something terribly wrong with him and that she would lose him.</p> <p>She went to the nursery and saw him surrounded by doctors who said he was having problems co-ordinating sucking and swallowing. He was brought to her at 7pm and appeared to have no problem co-ordinating sucking and swallowing when she breastfed him. The next morning a doctor came in and announced that she had tested positive for THC, the active ingredient in cannabis. She was charged under civil laws with child abuse and neglect and was warned that she might lose the baby. 'It was terrible to be accused like that. I was with my son 24/7 and loved and adored him and took excellent care of him. And I still do. He's my life,' says Deneen.</p> <p>'I had to sign a form consenting to random drugs tests and had to agree to go to parenting classes. And all the time I had a court case hanging over me. I had no idea that I or my son had been tested for drugs. They must have stolen the urine from my catheter during my C-section.'</p> <p>She was so terrified of having her son, who she called Justice, taken away during the first weeks of his life that she gave up cannabis although not using it made her feel physically ill. 'I couldn't eat food with poppy seeds in or herbal teas in case they made me test positive and they wanted to check Justice for broken bones, HIV and all sorts.' Social workers called regularly, and one day one visited and insisted Deneen change the baby's nappy. As she laid him on the floor, the social worker bent down to inspect him and he peed all over her.</p> <p>'That was the one thing in all this which really made me laugh. It was his first act of civil disobedience,' she says. 'The whole experience made me feel as if I was being raped by society. I couldn't experience the joy of holding a newborn baby that had survived while the others hadn't - they took that away from me. They made me feel like low-life, white trash.' On the day she was due to go to court, her lawyer phoned to say that the case had been dropped although she remains on the state register as a child abuser and neglecter until Justice is 18.</p> <p>'I would love to have another child,' says Deneen, 'but now I'm scared to death. However, the whole experience did make me think that if this was happening to me, what was happening to other people? I decided to speak out because of the way all this has affected my life and my son's life. I'm sure the founding fathers must be spinning in their graves. Our rights were put there to protect us, but instead they are being used against people like me who are being subjected to cruel and unusual punishments.'</p> <p>Back in Charleston at the Wide Awake Plantation the women who took their case to the Supreme Court wonder what day the court will deliver its judgement. Lori Griffin was taken to jail in chains right at the start of MUSC's policy in October 1989, when she was eight months pregnant. Having tested positive for cocaine, she had to remain in chains when she returned to the hospital for final prenatal checks and to give birth. 'I was charged with distributing drugs to a minor, not realising that the minor was the foetus,' she explains. 'I'd never been in trouble with the law before; I hadn't even got a traffic ticket. The worst thing was having my baby taken off me. I know I'm a good mother and take good care of my kids, and when I came home from the hospital without my baby, everyone in the neighbourhood was whispering about me. It was so hurtful when my two older children said: \"You don't even have the baby.\"'</p> <p>Laverne Singleton, 44, also received prenatal care at MUSC in the autumn of 1989. She was using cocaine during the pregnancy and discovered she had tested positive for the drug soon after her son Arnold's birth. In her notes, Brown wrote that she 'confronted' Singleton about her drug use and about three hours after she gave birth, Singleton was arrested in her hospital room by police and charged with unlawful neglect of a child. Handcuffed and wearing only a hospital gown she was taken out of the hospital in a wheelchair and detained for a week.</p> <p>'By the time I got to the cell my gown was covered in blood because I was haemorrhaging. But the staff had no sympathy and no remorse for what they did to me. As soon as I gave birth, they took my baby away. I never even got to look at his face. He was put into foster care and I had to fight through the courts to get him back.' It was a month before she saw her son again. She says that although hospital staff tested her blood and urine during her pregnancy while she was using drugs, no one ever said anything about her testing positive for drugs.</p> <p>Missy Nicholson, another woman involved in the Supreme Court action, is convinced that policies to punish pregnant women end up driving them underground. 'I know of one woman who had an abortion because she was scared to death about what this hospital would do to her, and another who went to New York to have her baby to avoid this place. I sure wouldn't have come here for my prenatal care if I'd known what was going on.'</p> <p>While most of the women who tested positive for drugs were using cocaine, Nicholson was taking heroin. A clinic which was part of the MUSC complex had put her on a methadone-maintenance programme during her pregnancy. In February 1994, the clinic told her she was dehydrated and had to go to MUSC's ER. Puzzled at the diagnosis, Nicholson went. She waited for more than an hour and began panicking that she would be late to collect her seven-year-old son Joshua from school.</p> <p>Eventually Brown came in and announced that she had tested positive for opiates. 'I told her I knew that because I was on prescription methadone at the clinic. I trusted patient- doctor confidentiality, but once Brown got to me, that was finished. She asked me if I'd go into treatment for my drug use. I said I'd think about it but right now I had to collect my son from school. She wouldn't even let me call anyone to say I'd be late. I tried to leave, but two policemen appeared and handcuffed me. I was forced to stay in treatment until after the baby was born.'</p> <p>Nicholson sees an irony in the fact that a policy which is supposed to protect children and turn women into better mothers forces them to neglect their living children by placing them in custody or removing their newborn babies to foster care. Meanwhile, campaigners are concerned that the protection of civil rights looks seriously threatened. The powerful National Organization of Women has declared a state of emergency over the Bush administration's plans to erode women's rights, particularly the right to abortion. A new bill is coming to Congress which seeks to give a foetus separate legal status, part of a policy described by feminists as 'our Vietnam, where the future of young women is being decided by old men in Washington who will never confront the danger themselves'. The punitive approach to pregnant women is likely to continue, says Paltrow. She cites the case of a woman in California who has been accused of peddling eugenics by paying female drug users $200 to get sterilised.</p> <p>In north Charleston, Crystal Ferguson carefully brushes Annika's hair. It's a brilliantly sunny Sunday and she's taking her daughters to the park and the library. She lowers her voice and turns away from her daughter in the hope that she won't hear what she is saying. 'My childhood was lousy. I was taught by my mother to do as she said, not as she did. There was always a lot of drinking in the house, and we children weren't allowed to come out of our room when other people were there. When I was 12 and 13 I was repeatedly raped by a relative. I never reported it to the police and it made me feel very low, like a whore. It's because of what happened to me as a child that I'm putting myself through this ordeal of going to court and making a stand. People think this is the land of rights, but it isn't for people like me. I hope we will win the case and get some money so I can provide a decent home and a stable environment for my daughters. I'm doing all this for them so they will be able to make better choices than I ever had the opportunity to make.'</p> <p>\u0095 Last month, the women won their case at the US Supreme Court. The judges supported them by six votes to three.</p>",

They tried to do something about it and the thanks they got was this lawsuit trying to get money for these women who are using drugs, which is a crime anyway. I have seen these children die or become teen criminals and commit crazy crimes because their brains have been messed up by drugs in the womb. 'I voted for Bush because I believe he's going to make a great president and I know he would agree totally with what the hospital did because it was medically and socially right. These women are pathetic human beings, they lead pathetic lives, and they need help. The mother and the foetus both have rights, but society has a duty to protect the weaker of the two. The baby can't do anything about its momma using cocaine. To me, exposing a baby to drugs in the womb is no different from taking a pistol and shooting the baby right through the mother's stomach or taking a knife and sticking it in there.' Controversy surrounds the so-called 'crack babies' born in the late 80s and early 90s and the subject of much media interest. Contrary to reports, many of the women who tested positive for drugs at MUSC and elsewhere gave birth to healthy babies. When hospitals in New York adopted a policy of taking in all babies born to mothers using cocaine, they soon realised they'd made a mistake. They were inundated with nurseries full of babies, many of them healthy. While nobody advocates taking drugs during pregnancy (including the women in the Ferguson case), the harm caused by cocaine is being re-evaluated as just one risk factor, alongside the use of other drugs. Alcohol and cigarettes have caused more proven harm to babies, and a 1999 study found that poverty had more impact on the developing brain of the foetus than cocaine. The question is: does the 'shackles and chains' approach encourage drug-using pregnant women to seek help? At first Nurse Brown insisted that it did. In a report in 1993, she said the policy was working. However, she later admitted her data had no scientific basis. Mary Faith Marshall, an ethicist who worked at MUSC and testified against the hospital in court, questioned the medical value of this approach. 'The scientific evidence is that cocaine, compared to legal drugs such as alcohol and tobacco, has a very minor effect on foetal outcome.' She added that there was no evidence that the policy promoted healthy pregnancies; rather, it alienated a particular population of patients. Many medical groups believe that the way this policy violated doctor-patient confidentiality has serious implications. And recently the Southern Regional Project on infant mortality found that pregnant women who use drugs won't seek help if they feel that their doctors are going to turn them in to the police. Reuben Greenberg, Charleston police chief, is upbeat about his officers' involvement. He says they were simply upholding state law. 'If someone says a child has been abused, we have to investigate. We don't handcuff everyone, but in the judgment of my officers the women who were restrained needed to be restrained. An intelligent assessment of the risk was made.' Lynn Paltrow - a lawyer representing the 10 women, director of National Advocates for Pregnant Women and one of Hood's 'ladies from New York' - has worked on the case for many years, along with Susan Dunn, a Charleston lawyer. Paltrow is in Charleston for a weekend gathering with lawyers, advocates, activists and the women involved in the Supreme Court case. Sitting in the tranquil living room at the Wide Awake Plantation on the outskirts of town, tears stream down the faces of the women taking the case as they relive what happened to them at MUSC. Paltrow says that the policy has disproportionately targeted poor black women, a charge the hospital denies. 'This issue is about race, about anti-feminism and about America's war on drugs. Carrying black women out of the hospital in chains evokes images of slavery. This policy was never about protecting children - there was no follow-up for the children, no treatment for them despite the mythical claims of severe damage - it was all about punishing women.' The modern slavery Paltrow refers to has a history in South Carolina, the only US state which still flies the Confederate flag. Around one-third of the slaves who came to North America from African countries entered through Charleston and were quarantined in pens on Sullivan Island before they were sold at slave markets in the city. More recently, MUSC itself was the focus of a pivotal strike during the civil-rights era. In June 1969, 12 black union activists were dismissed. At the time the hospital had no black doctors or nurse students - all the black employees were low-paid nurses' aides and service workers. Bed and waiting-room arrangements for black and white patients were separate and while white husbands were allowed into the delivery room, black ones were not. In an echo of that era, Nurse Brown said that the mixing of the races was 'against God's way'. The majority of the women selected for drug testing were black. Of the 10 who have taken their case to the US Supreme Court, only one is white and Brown remarked in her notes that she had a 'Negro' boyfriend. The hospital declined to allow Brown to be interviewed, but Hood says she apologised for the remark about keeping blacks and whites apart, which she put down to the fact that she was 'brought up in a small Southern town'. South Carolina, which as a result of a state Supreme Court decision recognises a foetus of 24 weeks or more as a person, has taken some of the most extreme steps to police pregnant women, but other states have passed equally restrictive laws. In 1997, Wisconsin created a new category of unborn child abuse - a child becomes a human being at fertilisation. Paltrow says that under this law, 'a zealous police officer who observes a pregnant woman drinking cocktails at a bar may take the woman into immediate custody'. Deneen Clark, 36, lives in what she had always thought was the relatively liberal state of New Jersey. She is white and single and is planning to embark on a law degree later this year. For several years she has smoked cannabis for medicinal purposes - she says the drug relaxes her and without it she suffers acute and crippling anxiety attacks which are so severe she is unable to eat. She had lost two babies in the womb due to rare medical conditions and so when she became pregnant in 1998 she was overjoyed. But she was terrified of losing another baby. She discussed her cannabis use with her doctor, who said it was preferable to smoking cigarettes during pregnancy. On 28 December 1998 she gave birth to a son by Caesarean section. As soon as he was born, he was whisked away by nurses who said they needed to check him over. When she still had not seen her baby by 4pm, she panicked that there was something terribly wrong with him and that she would lose him. She went to the nursery and saw him surrounded by doctors who said he was having problems co-ordinating sucking and swallowing. He was brought to her at 7pm and appeared to have no problem co-ordinating sucking and swallowing when she breastfed him. The next morning a doctor came in and announced that she had tested positive for THC, the active ingredient in cannabis. She was charged under civil laws with child abuse and neglect and was warned that she might lose the baby. 'It was terrible to be accused like that. I was with my son 24/7 and loved and adored him and took excellent care of him. And I still do. He's my life,' says Deneen. 'I had to sign a form consenting to random drugs tests and had to agree to go to parenting classes. And all the time I had a court case hanging over me. I had no idea that I or my son had been tested for drugs. They must have stolen the urine from my catheter during my C-section.' She was so terrified of having her son, who she called Justice, taken away during the first weeks of his life that she gave up cannabis although not using it made her feel physically ill. 'I couldn't eat food with poppy seeds in or herbal teas in case they made me test positive and they wanted to check Justice for broken bones, HIV and all sorts.' Social workers called regularly, and one day one visited and insisted Deneen change the baby's nappy. As she laid him on the floor, the social worker bent down to inspect him and he peed all over her. 'That was the one thing in all this which really made me laugh. It was his first act of civil disobedience,' she says. 'The whole experience made me feel as if I was being raped by society. I couldn't experience the joy of holding a newborn baby that had survived while the others hadn't - they took that away from me. They made me feel like low-life, white trash.' On the day she was due to go to court, her lawyer phoned to say that the case had been dropped although she remains on the state register as a child abuser and neglecter until Justice is 18. 'I would love to have another child,' says Deneen, 'but now I'm scared to death. However, the whole experience did make me think that if this was happening to me, what was happening to other people? I decided to speak out because of the way all this has affected my life and my son's life. I'm sure the founding fathers must be spinning in their graves. Our rights were put there to protect us, but instead they are being used against people like me who are being subjected to cruel and unusual punishments.' Back in Charleston at the Wide Awake Plantation the women who took their case to the Supreme Court wonder what day the court will deliver its judgement. Lori Griffin was taken to jail in chains right at the start of MUSC's policy in October 1989, when she was eight months pregnant. Having tested positive for cocaine, she had to remain in chains when she returned to the hospital for final prenatal checks and to give birth. 'I was charged with distributing drugs to a minor, not realising that the minor was the foetus,' she explains. 'I'd never been in trouble with the law before; I hadn't even got a traffic ticket. The worst thing was having my baby taken off me. I know I'm a good mother and take good care of my kids, and when I came home from the hospital without my baby, everyone in the neighbourhood was whispering about me. It was so hurtful when my two older children said: \"You don't even have the baby.\"' Laverne Singleton, 44, also received prenatal care at MUSC in the autumn of 1989. She was using cocaine during the pregnancy and discovered she had tested positive for the drug soon after her son Arnold's birth. In her notes, Brown wrote that she 'confronted' Singleton about her drug use and about three hours after she gave birth, Singleton was arrested in her hospital room by police and charged with unlawful neglect of a child. Handcuffed and wearing only a hospital gown she was taken out of the hospital in a wheelchair and detained for a week. 'By the time I got to the cell my gown was covered in blood because I was haemorrhaging. But the staff had no sympathy and no remorse for what they did to me. As soon as I gave birth, they took my baby away. I never even got to look at his face. He was put into foster care and I had to fight through the courts to get him back.' It was a month before she saw her son again. She says that although hospital staff tested her blood and urine during her pregnancy while she was using drugs, no one ever said anything about her testing positive for drugs. Missy Nicholson, another woman involved in the Supreme Court action, is convinced that policies to punish pregnant women end up driving them underground. 'I know of one woman who had an abortion because she was scared to death about what this hospital would do to her, and another who went to New York to have her baby to avoid this place. I sure wouldn't have come here for my prenatal care if I'd known what was going on.' While most of the women who tested positive for drugs were using cocaine, Nicholson was taking heroin. A clinic which was part of the MUSC complex had put her on a methadone-maintenance programme during her pregnancy. In February 1994, the clinic told her she was dehydrated and had to go to MUSC's ER. Puzzled at the diagnosis, Nicholson went. She waited for more than an hour and began panicking that she would be late to collect her seven-year-old son Joshua from school. Eventually Brown came in and announced that she had tested positive for opiates. 'I told her I knew that because I was on prescription methadone at the clinic. I trusted patient- doctor confidentiality, but once Brown got to me, that was finished. She asked me if I'd go into treatment for my drug use. I said I'd think about it but right now I had to collect my son from school. She wouldn't even let me call anyone to say I'd be late. I tried to leave, but two policemen appeared and handcuffed me. I was forced to stay in treatment until after the baby was born.' Nicholson sees an irony in the fact that a policy which is supposed to protect children and turn women into better mothers forces them to neglect their living children by placing them in custody or removing their newborn babies to foster care. Meanwhile, campaigners are concerned that the protection of civil rights looks seriously threatened. The powerful National Organization of Women has declared a state of emergency over the Bush administration's plans to erode women's rights, particularly the right to abortion. A new bill is coming to Congress which seeks to give a foetus separate legal status, part of a policy described by feminists as 'our Vietnam, where the future of young women is being decided by old men in Washington who will never confront the danger themselves'. The punitive approach to pregnant women is likely to continue, says Paltrow. She cites the case of a woman in California who has been accused of peddling eugenics by paying female drug users $200 to get sterilised. In north Charleston, Crystal Ferguson carefully brushes Annika's hair. It's a brilliantly sunny Sunday and she's taking her daughters to the park and the library. She lowers her voice and turns away from her daughter in the hope that she won't hear what she is saying. 'My childhood was lousy. I was taught by my mother to do as she said, not as she did. There was always a lot of drinking in the house, and we children weren't allowed to come out of our room when other people were there. When I was 12 and 13 I was repeatedly raped by a relative. I never reported it to the police and it made me feel very low, like a whore. It's because of what happened to me as a child that I'm putting myself through this ordeal of going to court and making a stand. People think this is the land of rights, but it isn't for people like me. I hope we will win the case and get some money so I can provide a decent home and a stable environment for my daughters. I'm doing all this for them so they will be able to make better choices than I ever had the opportunity to make.' \u0095 Last month, the women won their case at the US Supreme Court. The judges supported them by six votes to three.",

      "body": "<p>In a marble-floored room backstage at the Salle Wagram in Paris, only minutes before her catwalk show, Vivienne Westwood is being interviewed for American TV. The question is one she has answered many times, and will answer many times again. What does she think about the remark, made more than 10 years ago by the hugely influential publisher of Women's Wear Daily, to the effect that she is one of the six most important designers of the 20th century?</p> <p>'I do remember Mr Fairchild was the most important person for me in terms of press,' she says softly, in her modest Derbyshire tones, which seem completely out of place amid the whoosh of hairdryers and babble of models, stylists, make-up artists, dressers and assistants speaking French, Italian, Japanese and Euro-English. Outside, Bianca Jagger and Scary Spice are in the front row, gumming for the paparazzi. The place is packed, three models still haven't turned up, and her husband and collaborator Andreas Kronthaler is flitting around nervously, making calls on his mobile, trying to find them.</p> <p>Yet while chaos swirls all around, she remains calm, tranquil, focused. And polite. So polite. Her manners, like the way she holds her body and her speech patterns, seem to belong to a distant age, an era of consideration, of thrift and deference.</p> <p>And yet her clothes say something completely different. She wears an off-white lace blouse that somehow wraps around a white miniskirt, with emerald green tights and pointed beige shoes. Her hair is a bouffant swirl of honey-coloured candyfloss. Her face is pale, bone-coloured, the eyes like bits of green glass, her lips a deep scarlet. Over her left arm hangs her handbag, in her left hand she clutches a bronze orb necklace, a 3-D version of her logo, while in her right she holds a Gitanes. She wafts it around as she speaks, making her point.</p> <p>'Even when I had no collection to speak of,' she continues, 'he always was a great supporter. I got this OBE in England, and I think it would never have happened if not for Mr Fairchild. But suddenly, after his remark, the British thought, \"Oh, maybe this madwoman really is a designer.\"'</p> <p>For the time being, the British seem to think that again. Whether they will change their minds, as they have done before, remains to be seen.</p> <p>It seems hard to believe that Vivienne Westwood is 60 years old today. Vivienne the first punk, the original Buffalo Gal, the woman who gave us the minicrini and the bustier, underwear as overwear, 10in scarlet patent platforms and a new, officially recognised tartan, the MacAndreas (named after her husband), that Vivienne - is now of pensionable age. A quarter of a century has passed since the Sex Pistols first exploded the myth of a counter-cultural consensus, dressed in T-shirts she and Malcolm McLaren had designed, spouting lines they had perfected about hating hippies and wanting to set the clocks back to Year Zero.</p> <p>Over the past quarter century, she has skirted bankruptcy and immersed herself in high culture, married, become a grandmother, and weathered the vagaries of the international fashion press to emerge with her reputation intact and her business flourishing. Meanwhile, the British, for their part, have alternated between hailing her as a genius and ignoring her entirely.</p> <p>It seems equally strange that she is so often dismissed by British journalists as humourless, this woman who printed breasts on T-shirts for men, who used to stick gold cigarette paper on her teeth, who posed for photos wearing one of her own plastic bags as a headscarf, who did that brilliant impersonation of Thatcher for a Tatler cover, and who went to Buckingham Palace to collect her OBE wearing a flesh-coloured, see-through shift and no knickers. Is her humour simply too old-fashioned - as in offbeat and deadpan - for today's tastes?</p> <p>At her office, she furrows her brow and says I look familiar: had we met before? Well, no, but I'd seen her many times over the years. Where? Well, the first was at the Sex Pistols' gig at the Screen On The Green cinema in Islington. Her pale green eyes light up. 'Oh, that was the best, an absolutely fantastic performance.' But at the mention of Glenn Matlock, the original Pistols bassist, she bristles, dismissing that 'poxy little student'. Nice to know, then, that age hasn't smoothed off all her spiky edges.</p> <p>Today, if she celebrates her birthday (at its mention, she wrinkles her nose and says, 'I don't like parties'), she can raise her glass in the knowledge that she is suddenly 'fashionable' again. Not, of course, that she really cares, you see, since she's been through it all before, and besides, she doesn't really see herself as part of the fashion industry.</p> <p>The fashion industry being what it is - cyclical, short on memory and long on space - a new generation has rediscovered her work and is busily touting it in magazines such as Dazed &amp; Confused , i-D and Pop . In particular, they love her early 80s collections, the Buffalo and Punkature and Nostalgia of Mud stuff; original pieces in any condition change hands for hundreds of pounds (the earlier stuff, the punk and pirates' gear, has been snapped up by museums and Japanese collectors). Artist Tracey Emin sings her praises in interviews and models her clothes for magazine adverts. Meanwhile, the latest collections by Balenciaga, MiuMiu and Sophia Kokosalaki all pay homage to Queen Viv, suddenly everyone's favourite designer. To seal the deal, the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum is planning a vast retrospective of her work for 2004.</p> <p>Certainly, she professes herself happier than at any time for years. Business is thriving, orders are coming in, a second perfume has just been launched. 'I love designing at the moment, I'm so happy with my work.'</p> <p>It wasn't always like this. For years she lived in an ex-council flat in Nightingale Lane, Clapham, though now she has a spacious terraced house in a much smarter part of the same borough. In the early 90s, her company, struggling to survive, was run by her son Joe Corr\u00e9 from a dingy sweatshop space just off Camden High Street. 'They were really broke in those days,' remembers one former worker. 'At one point, they were paying people in skirts and jumpers. She kept the thing going on sheer willpower. Anyone without as much self-belief as her would have gone under.'</p> <p>Yet if the business is now sounder than ever, it seems unlikely Westwood has sorted it herself. 'She's like the Queen,' says another ex-employee. She doesn't really understand money.' There are stories of Westwood using her company credit card to book seats for a season of concerts for her and Andreas. Yet she considers herself very frugal.</p> <p>Curiously for a designer of international repute, one honoured for her services to fashion, and despite her membership of the Royal College of Art, she does not teach on any British fashion course - simply, she says, because she doesn't get asked. Yet she has taught in Vienna - where she met Andreas, initially her student - and currently teaches in Berlin on a regular basis. Why, then, isn't she a senior lecturer at St Martin's?</p> <p>'I have no explanation for this,' she says. 'But I remember years ago, a student telling me that one of her tutors at St Martin's had said that I wasn't a fashion designer.' Anyway, she says, there are a lot of people who come out of St Martin's who have no technical ability.</p> <p>'There is no hierarchy of values any more. Real progress is due mainly to human genius, and that's rare, and usually stems from a real elite, from a hierarchy,' she says, citing the importance of aristocratic patronage from Renaissance times onward, and in particular the intellectual salons of the 19th- century Parisian bourgeoisie. Perhaps this is why she has been so often ignored: an outspoken critic of the dumbing-down of British culture, she has no time for the sacred cow of popular taste. In an age of Big Brother and Popstars, this doesn't play very well, and the fashion press certainly doesn't want to hear her proclaiming, as she is wont to, that most fashion is dull, conventional camouflage for timid, ignorant consumers.</p> <p>Westwood admits that her decidedly unfashionable views have been shaped by her friend Gary Ness, a Canadian editor and former painter who has lived in Paris most of his life. A few days after our first interview, she invites me to his 7th arrondissement apartment, partly to explain a relationship which, she says, has been 'like going to a wonderful school, one that would cost millions and millions of pounds. Whatever I'm interested in, Gary has a book on it, or will find a painting or poem on a related theme. He can always point me in the right direction to learn more about it, or suggest a complimentary area of study.' She takes tea while Andreas sits quietly by her side. He is tall and shockingly handsome, with broad shoulders and a tiny waist, big blue eyes, a mane of lustrous dark hair, and what looks like a duelling scar on his right cheek. They met 10 years ago when he was her student in Vienna's Academy for Applied Arts, where she is an honorary professor.</p> <p>They married because he was from Austria, at that time a non-EU country, and was always having problems with immigration whenever they travelled. 'It's a funny thing,' she says, 'because he was my boyfriend and I was saying to him, \"We have to find someone for you to marry, and then it'll be all right.\" And he said, \"Well, I should marry you.\"'</p> <p>We sit and talk, but mostly listen, as Gary Ness holds forth on culture, art, fashion, the media, history, everything, while Westwood questions him, pressing him to explain himself, justify his opinions. She seems to be without guile, often touchingly open and even indiscreet - she makes several remarks about her business which, though unimportant, would cause embarrassment in print. Ness, an elegant, erudite but Waspish aesthete in his 60s, is recovering from a bad attack of shingles. He lounges on a burgundy velvet chaise longue, sipping a glass of water, fanning himself with a black lacquered fan, peering down his long aquiline nose at me with suspicion. His grey hair is swept straight back from a widow's peak, his grey beard neatly clipped, he wears an impeccable grey windowpane check suit and black brogues. They met in 1977, when he asked to paint her portrait. 'But I never finished it,' he says, 'because we just started talking and... continued.'</p> <p>Ness, who edited Roland Penrose's biography of Picasso and was a 'drinking buddy' of photographer Lee Miller, insists that Westwood's genius has been continuously overlooked. Their mutual admiration society might seem faintly ludicrous to outsiders, but Westwood clearly treasures it and finds it invaluable. And he is certainly her champion, denouncing a recent biography which paints a less than flattering picture. 'Poison, pure bile,' he hisses.</p> <p>What was so offensive? There is a pause. 'Well, for example, it said that Andreas had fucked everyone in my studio,' says Vivienne, dismayed. Andreas nods dolefully, shrugs his shoulders. And then he suddenly winks at me and flashes a cheeky smile, before resuming his deadpan expression. Confused, I look at Vivienne and Gary - but if they noticed, they don't react.</p> <p>The orb necklace, it turns out, is also a cigarette lighter. She sparks up a chain of Gitanes, scraping them out in neat, circular movements and pausing briefly before lighting another. While she talks, her delicate hands, with their papery white skin and finely pointed fingers, move gently over an invisible torso, fitting an imaginary fabric around it - the way a blind person might study a form. Meanwhile, her eyes look up and to her right, as if consulting some kind of internal menu of her thoughts.</p> <p>'Spatial intelligence' is how she describes her working process. 'I've got a real sense of three-dimensional geometry. I can look at a flat piece of fabric and know that if I put a slit in it and make some fabric travel around a square, then when you lift it up it will drape in a certain way, and I can feel how that will happen.'</p> <p>'With Westwood, the body speaks first,' says Pamela Golbin, curator of 20th-century costume at the Louvre - the world's greatest collection - and an expert on the history of women's clothing. 'More conventional designers impose a silhouette from the outside, whereas she defines femininity first, then expresses it through bodily volume and proportion, and her silhouette emerges from that.'</p> <p>An example, says Golbin, is the way she used the 'faux cul' for the spring/summer 1994 'Erogenous Zones' collection, where she created a kind of lightweight bustle. 'She decided she was sick of the conventional expression of femininity being focused almost entirely on the breasts, and literally inverted the emphasis, putting it on the butt. There's always this conceptual aspect to her work, every few years she redefines femininity and how she thinks it should be expressed today.</p> <p>'Also with Westwood, sexuality is never latent, it's always on the surface. Her clothes intensify the sexuality of the wearer... making both the wearer and the observer very aware of the body.'</p> <p>Both Westwood and Kronthaler talk again and again about their clothes having 'vitality' and 'life'. Their ideal is a perfect marriage of sensuality and aesthetics, of luxury and drama. For her, clothes should intensify and refine the wearer's sense of physical presence; provoke a reaction, charge the atmosphere with sexual and political tension; they should directly alter the physical reality of the world around them. Clearly, this kind of clothing poses questions, and challenges us to explore, to consider the unknown. It can make us uncomfortable, this fashion that works like a drug, that alters our state of consciousness. Which is why, generally speaking, we prefer Gap, or Gucci.</p> <p>Vivienne Swire was born on 8 April 1941 to poor, working-class parents in Glossop, Derbyshire. Her family moved to Harrow in search of work when she was 16. At a local dance she met Derek John Westwood, a BEA steward who shared her love of rock'n'roll. 'He was very lively and ever such a good dancer,' she later said. They were married in 1962, and Vivienne made her own wedding dress, a normal thing in those days, though by her own admission she was 'very handy with a needle and thread' and had 'a perfect figure'. Soon after, she left her typing job to become a primary school teacher in Willesden, north London. The couple had a son, Benjamin, in 1963.</p> <p>Their marriage was falling apart in 1965 when she met 18-year-old Malcolm Edwards, who later said that he was 'still a virgin' at the time. By 1967, they were living together in south London, Edwards was at Croydon College of Art, and they had a baby son, Joseph Corr\u00e9. Over the next 10 years, Westwood (she kept her married name) metamorphosed from working-class housewife and primary school teacher into a designer of politico-erotic clothing. Her first step was to cut her hair dramatically, and with it all ties to her past. In 1969, Granny Takes A Trip boutique owner Gene Krell first encountered Vivienne Westwood, a moment he describes as 'unforgettable'.</p> <p>'Dressed in tight, velvet leopardskin-print slacks and black patent booties with a stiletto heel, she had spiky blonde hair. I was staggered by her style, and had to find out more, to understand it.'</p> <p>Edwards (as Malcolm McLaren was called until 1971) channelled her latent creativity into fashion. Their relationship had a powerful dynamic: he was the wild-eyed Situationist explaining art theory and citing Guy Debord's Society of the Spectacle ; she was the methodical craftswoman, literally dissecting rock'n'roll fashions in order to reinvent them.</p> <p>Westwood's design skills and McLaren's talent for media manipulation evolved through several versions of their King's Road boutique, each more provocative and challenging than the last: Let It Rock became Too Fast to Live Too Young to Die, which in summer 1974 reopened as Sex, selling rubber and bondage clothing.</p> <p>'It was about this time,' remembers Glenn Matlock, 'that Vivienne began to get really evangelistic about it all. I remember one bloke who was part of a crowd that had been coming into the shop since the early days. They'd started out as mods but gradually drifted into Alan Ladd suits. One of them looked at the rubber gear and said, \"Cor, I don't know about this any more, this is all a bit too weird for me.\" Vivienne piled into him. \"Oh you, you look like you should be in a fucking potting shed,\" she said. \"Not my shop. If you don't like it, get out.\"</p> <p>'I wondered how to create these street heroes,' she says, 'and I definitely wanted to attack the establishment, so I looked at all the icons of rebellion over the years, and tried to put that together in an original way.'

The following year, Naomi Campbell made front pages around the world by falling off Westwood's 10in platforms, which subsequently flew out of the shops.

She loves her work, and can't imagine a time when she wouldn't want to make clothes, to give her ideas expression through the female form. And the ideas come so quickly, it's all she can do to keep up with herself. This latest collection, Wild Beauty, was inspired by the drape of the garments on classical Greek statuary, she says, tracing the line of an imaginary robe with her hands.

Because, she said, my clothes are timeless.' There's a pause, while she wonders whether to continue. She nods to herself, and adds, ever so politely, 'And I think that's right.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "In a marble-floored room backstage at the Salle Wagram in Paris, only minutes before her catwalk show, Vivienne Westwood is being interviewed for American TV. The question is one she has answered many times, and will answer many times again. What does she think about the remark, made more than 10 years ago by the hugely influential publisher of Women's Wear Daily, to the effect that she is one of the six most important designers of the 20th century? 'I do remember Mr Fairchild was the most important person for me in terms of press,' she says softly, in her modest Derbyshire tones, which seem completely out of place amid the whoosh of hairdryers and babble of models, stylists, make-up artists, dressers and assistants speaking French, Italian, Japanese and Euro-English. Outside, Bianca Jagger and Scary Spice are in the front row, gumming for the paparazzi. The place is packed, three models still haven't turned up, and her husband and collaborator Andreas Kronthaler is flitting around nervously, making calls on his mobile, trying to find them. Yet while chaos swirls all around, she remains calm, tranquil, focused. And polite. So polite. Her manners, like the way she holds her body and her speech patterns, seem to belong to a distant age, an era of consideration, of thrift and deference. And yet her clothes say something completely different. She wears an off-white lace blouse that somehow wraps around a white miniskirt, with emerald green tights and pointed beige shoes. Her hair is a bouffant swirl of honey-coloured candyfloss. Her face is pale, bone-coloured, the eyes like bits of green glass, her lips a deep scarlet. Over her left arm hangs her handbag, in her left hand she clutches a bronze orb necklace, a 3-D version of her logo, while in her right she holds a Gitanes. She wafts it around as she speaks, making her point. 'Even when I had no collection to speak of,' she continues, 'he always was a great supporter. I got this OBE in England, and I think it would never have happened if not for Mr Fairchild. But suddenly, after his remark, the British thought, \"Oh, maybe this madwoman really is a designer.\"' For the time being, the British seem to think that again. Whether they will change their minds, as they have done before, remains to be seen. It seems hard to believe that Vivienne Westwood is 60 years old today. Vivienne the first punk, the original Buffalo Gal, the woman who gave us the minicrini and the bustier, underwear as overwear, 10in scarlet patent platforms and a new, officially recognised tartan, the MacAndreas (named after her husband), that Vivienne - is now of pensionable age. A quarter of a century has passed since the Sex Pistols first exploded the myth of a counter-cultural consensus, dressed in T-shirts she and Malcolm McLaren had designed, spouting lines they had perfected about hating hippies and wanting to set the clocks back to Year Zero. Over the past quarter century, she has skirted bankruptcy and immersed herself in high culture, married, become a grandmother, and weathered the vagaries of the international fashion press to emerge with her reputation intact and her business flourishing. Meanwhile, the British, for their part, have alternated between hailing her as a genius and ignoring her entirely. It seems equally strange that she is so often dismissed by British journalists as humourless, this woman who printed breasts on T-shirts for men, who used to stick gold cigarette paper on her teeth, who posed for photos wearing one of her own plastic bags as a headscarf, who did that brilliant impersonation of Thatcher for a Tatler cover, and who went to Buckingham Palace to collect her OBE wearing a flesh-coloured, see-through shift and no knickers. Is her humour simply too old-fashioned - as in offbeat and deadpan - for today's tastes? At her office, she furrows her brow and says I look familiar: had we met before? Well, no, but I'd seen her many times over the years. Where? Well, the first was at the Sex Pistols' gig at the Screen On The Green cinema in Islington. Her pale green eyes light up. 'Oh, that was the best, an absolutely fantastic performance.' But at the mention of Glenn Matlock, the original Pistols bassist, she bristles, dismissing that 'poxy little student'. Nice to know, then, that age hasn't smoothed off all her spiky edges. Today, if she celebrates her birthday (at its mention, she wrinkles her nose and says, 'I don't like parties'), she can raise her glass in the knowledge that she is suddenly 'fashionable' again. Not, of course, that she really cares, you see, since she's been through it all before, and besides, she doesn't really see herself as part of the fashion industry. The fashion industry being what it is - cyclical, short on memory and long on space - a new generation has rediscovered her work and is busily touting it in magazines such as Dazed &amp; Confused , i-D and Pop . In particular, they love her early 80s collections, the Buffalo and Punkature and Nostalgia of Mud stuff; original pieces in any condition change hands for hundreds of pounds (the earlier stuff, the punk and pirates' gear, has been snapped up by museums and Japanese collectors). Artist Tracey Emin sings her praises in interviews and models her clothes for magazine adverts. Meanwhile, the latest collections by Balenciaga, MiuMiu and Sophia Kokosalaki all pay homage to Queen Viv, suddenly everyone's favourite designer. To seal the deal, the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum is planning a vast retrospective of her work for 2004. Certainly, she professes herself happier than at any time for years. Business is thriving, orders are coming in, a second perfume has just been launched. 'I love designing at the moment, I'm so happy with my work.' It wasn't always like this. For years she lived in an ex-council flat in Nightingale Lane, Clapham, though now she has a spacious terraced house in a much smarter part of the same borough. In the early 90s, her company, struggling to survive, was run by her son Joe Corr\u00e9 from a dingy sweatshop space just off Camden High Street. 'They were really broke in those days,' remembers one former worker. 'At one point, they were paying people in skirts and jumpers. She kept the thing going on sheer willpower. Anyone without as much self-belief as her would have gone under.' Yet if the business is now sounder than ever, it seems unlikely Westwood has sorted it herself. 'She's like the Queen,' says another ex-employee. She doesn't really understand money.' There are stories of Westwood using her company credit card to book seats for a season of concerts for her and Andreas. Yet she considers herself very frugal. Curiously for a designer of international repute, one honoured for her services to fashion, and despite her membership of the Royal College of Art, she does not teach on any British fashion course - simply, she says, because she doesn't get asked. Yet she has taught in Vienna - where she met Andreas, initially her student - and currently teaches in Berlin on a regular basis. Why, then, isn't she a senior lecturer at St Martin's? 'I have no explanation for this,' she says. 'But I remember years ago, a student telling me that one of her tutors at St Martin's had said that I wasn't a fashion designer.' Anyway, she says, there are a lot of people who come out of St Martin's who have no technical ability. 'There is no hierarchy of values any more. Real progress is due mainly to human genius, and that's rare, and usually stems from a real elite, from a hierarchy,' she says, citing the importance of aristocratic patronage from Renaissance times onward, and in particular the intellectual salons of the 19th- century Parisian bourgeoisie. Perhaps this is why she has been so often ignored: an outspoken critic of the dumbing-down of British culture, she has no time for the sacred cow of popular taste. In an age of Big Brother and Popstars, this doesn't play very well, and the fashion press certainly doesn't want to hear her proclaiming, as she is wont to, that most fashion is dull, conventional camouflage for timid, ignorant consumers. Westwood admits that her decidedly unfashionable views have been shaped by her friend Gary Ness, a Canadian editor and former painter who has lived in Paris most of his life. A few days after our first interview, she invites me to his 7th arrondissement apartment, partly to explain a relationship which, she says, has been 'like going to a wonderful school, one that would cost millions and millions of pounds. Whatever I'm interested in, Gary has a book on it, or will find a painting or poem on a related theme. He can always point me in the right direction to learn more about it, or suggest a complimentary area of study.' She takes tea while Andreas sits quietly by her side. He is tall and shockingly handsome, with broad shoulders and a tiny waist, big blue eyes, a mane of lustrous dark hair, and what looks like a duelling scar on his right cheek. They met 10 years ago when he was her student in Vienna's Academy for Applied Arts, where she is an honorary professor. They married because he was from Austria, at that time a non-EU country, and was always having problems with immigration whenever they travelled. 'It's a funny thing,' she says, 'because he was my boyfriend and I was saying to him, \"We have to find someone for you to marry, and then it'll be all right.\" And he said, \"Well, I should marry you.\"' We sit and talk, but mostly listen, as Gary Ness holds forth on culture, art, fashion, the media, history, everything, while Westwood questions him, pressing him to explain himself, justify his opinions. She seems to be without guile, often touchingly open and even indiscreet - she makes several remarks about her business which, though unimportant, would cause embarrassment in print. Ness, an elegant, erudite but Waspish aesthete in his 60s, is recovering from a bad attack of shingles. He lounges on a burgundy velvet chaise longue, sipping a glass of water, fanning himself with a black lacquered fan, peering down his long aquiline nose at me with suspicion. His grey hair is swept straight back from a widow's peak, his grey beard neatly clipped, he wears an impeccable grey windowpane check suit and black brogues. They met in 1977, when he asked to paint her portrait. 'But I never finished it,' he says, 'because we just started talking and... continued.' Ness, who edited Roland Penrose's biography of Picasso and was a 'drinking buddy' of photographer Lee Miller, insists that Westwood's genius has been continuously overlooked. Their mutual admiration society might seem faintly ludicrous to outsiders, but Westwood clearly treasures it and finds it invaluable. And he is certainly her champion, denouncing a recent biography which paints a less than flattering picture. 'Poison, pure bile,' he hisses. What was so offensive? There is a pause. 'Well, for example, it said that Andreas had fucked everyone in my studio,' says Vivienne, dismayed. Andreas nods dolefully, shrugs his shoulders. And then he suddenly winks at me and flashes a cheeky smile, before resuming his deadpan expression. Confused, I look at Vivienne and Gary - but if they noticed, they don't react. The orb necklace, it turns out, is also a cigarette lighter. She sparks up a chain of Gitanes, scraping them out in neat, circular movements and pausing briefly before lighting another. While she talks, her delicate hands, with their papery white skin and finely pointed fingers, move gently over an invisible torso, fitting an imaginary fabric around it - the way a blind person might study a form. Meanwhile, her eyes look up and to her right, as if consulting some kind of internal menu of her thoughts. 'Spatial intelligence' is how she describes her working process. 'I've got a real sense of three-dimensional geometry. I can look at a flat piece of fabric and know that if I put a slit in it and make some fabric travel around a square, then when you lift it up it will drape in a certain way, and I can feel how that will happen.' 'With Westwood, the body speaks first,' says Pamela Golbin, curator of 20th-century costume at the Louvre - the world's greatest collection - and an expert on the history of women's clothing. 'More conventional designers impose a silhouette from the outside, whereas she defines femininity first, then expresses it through bodily volume and proportion, and her silhouette emerges from that.' An example, says Golbin, is the way she used the 'faux cul' for the spring/summer 1994 'Erogenous Zones' collection, where she created a kind of lightweight bustle. 'She decided she was sick of the conventional expression of femininity being focused almost entirely on the breasts, and literally inverted the emphasis, putting it on the butt. There's always this conceptual aspect to her work, every few years she redefines femininity and how she thinks it should be expressed today. 'Also with Westwood, sexuality is never latent, it's always on the surface. Her clothes intensify the sexuality of the wearer... making both the wearer and the observer very aware of the body.' Both Westwood and Kronthaler talk again and again about their clothes having 'vitality' and 'life'. Their ideal is a perfect marriage of sensuality and aesthetics, of luxury and drama. For her, clothes should intensify and refine the wearer's sense of physical presence; provoke a reaction, charge the atmosphere with sexual and political tension; they should directly alter the physical reality of the world around them. Clearly, this kind of clothing poses questions, and challenges us to explore, to consider the unknown. It can make us uncomfortable, this fashion that works like a drug, that alters our state of consciousness. Which is why, generally speaking, we prefer Gap, or Gucci. Vivienne Swire was born on 8 April 1941 to poor, working-class parents in Glossop, Derbyshire. Her family moved to Harrow in search of work when she was 16. At a local dance she met Derek John Westwood, a BEA steward who shared her love of rock'n'roll. 'He was very lively and ever such a good dancer,' she later said. They were married in 1962, and Vivienne made her own wedding dress, a normal thing in those days, though by her own admission she was 'very handy with a needle and thread' and had 'a perfect figure'. Soon after, she left her typing job to become a primary school teacher in Willesden, north London. The couple had a son, Benjamin, in 1963. Their marriage was falling apart in 1965 when she met 18-year-old Malcolm Edwards, who later said that he was 'still a virgin' at the time. By 1967, they were living together in south London, Edwards was at Croydon College of Art, and they had a baby son, Joseph Corr\u00e9. Over the next 10 years, Westwood (she kept her married name) metamorphosed from working-class housewife and primary school teacher into a designer of politico-erotic clothing. Her first step was to cut her hair dramatically, and with it all ties to her past. In 1969, Granny Takes A Trip boutique owner Gene Krell first encountered Vivienne Westwood, a moment he describes as 'unforgettable'. 'Dressed in tight, velvet leopardskin-print slacks and black patent booties with a stiletto heel, she had spiky blonde hair. I was staggered by her style, and had to find out more, to understand it.' Edwards (as Malcolm McLaren was called until 1971) channelled her latent creativity into fashion. Their relationship had a powerful dynamic: he was the wild-eyed Situationist explaining art theory and citing Guy Debord's Society of the Spectacle ; she was the methodical craftswoman, literally dissecting rock'n'roll fashions in order to reinvent them. Westwood's design skills and McLaren's talent for media manipulation evolved through several versions of their King's Road boutique, each more provocative and challenging than the last: Let It Rock became Too Fast to Live Too Young to Die, which in summer 1974 reopened as Sex, selling rubber and bondage clothing. 'It was about this time,' remembers Glenn Matlock, 'that Vivienne began to get really evangelistic about it all. I remember one bloke who was part of a crowd that had been coming into the shop since the early days. They'd started out as mods but gradually drifted into Alan Ladd suits. One of them looked at the rubber gear and said, \"Cor, I don't know about this any more, this is all a bit too weird for me.\" Vivienne piled into him. \"Oh you, you look like you should be in a fucking potting shed,\" she said. \"Not my shop. If you don't like it, get out.\" 'I wondered how to create these street heroes,' she says, 'and I definitely wanted to attack the establishment, so I looked at all the icons of rebellion over the years, and tried to put that together in an original way.' However, the punk backlash was much stronger and more hysterical than she and McLaren could have anticipated, and in 1976, after being charged with sedition over their 'pornographic' T-shirts, they changed the shop's name again, to Seditionaries. By late 1979, punk had given way to the New Romantic style, a procession of increasingly theatrical costumes heralding a time of theatrical self-indulgence. In response, Westwood and McLaren created their pirate look, unveiled at their first joint catwalk show in 1981.

Or, to be more precise, 'an American rock icon'. That's what it says on the US record label's treatment for the \u00a3300,000 video that will soon launch him on the American public, being shot an hour's drive out of Los Angeles. No clich\u00e9 will be left unturned: there will be Harley-Davidson motorcycles. There will be cacti and tumbleweed. An old man pumping gas by a run-down motel-diner. Ronan will be wearing blue denim and a white T-shirt, like James Dean in Giant.</p> <p>'His look will be Diesel meets Easy Rider in a Tommy Hilfiger ad,' says the treatment. He will be surrounded by beautiful people representing the beautiful people who will go out and buy Ronan's record. All these things are being made real 'Hollywood style' at an old film set in the desert built by Dennis Hopper. The Harleys and the cacti, the old man and the denims are real enough, even the beautiful people from central casting are real. Whether they really will go out and buy Ronan's record, buy into Ronan-the-rock- icon, is the crucial question.</p> <p>Ronan Keating, like Boyzone, is unknown to the American public. Even the video crew are unsure who he is. The director, a dreadlocked Benny Hill lookalike called Todd, knows who Ronan is, but is unsure who he was. 'I tried to download some Boyzone videos off the internet, but I couldn't find any,' he confesses. 'I don't know how he looked in Boyzone.' Well, we do. He looked like a fresh-faced clean-cut choirboy in a Gucci suit. Not like James Dean. And we're not used to him leaping around like this, impressing the beautiful extras with his boundless enthusiasm for spontaneously jumping off things in a designer junkyard, falling over among the cacti and gurning into the camera. The equally energetic Todd leaps up and down beside the camera like he's in the mosh pit, his dreads flapping as he encourages the dancers to show the same energy as this Irish guy they've, like, never heard of.</p> <p>You might find this hard to believe, but Ronan rocks, he really does. His new single - and US debut - 'Lovin' Each Day' (written by Gregg Alexander of the New Radicals) has loud electric guitars and an anthemic chorus. It's very American. It would not sound out of place on a Bon Jovi album. I had to listen to it almost continuously for two days, and I have to confess I still love it. The on-set hairdresser already thinks Ronan's the coolest. He's black and he's gay and he's had all Boyzone's records sent over by friends in England. 'Gahd, I love this shit!' he exclaims as the speakers blast out 'Lovin' Each Day' for the umpteenth time. 'It's, like, happy music!''</p> <p>Everyone likes the song, and everyone likes Ronan. It's impossible not to. He's polite and charming, professional and uncomplaining, despite a 5am start and a 14-hour working day. Of course it helps that he's got twinkly pale blue eyes, an easygoing nature and a smile for everyone. The crew must be wondering where he conceals his ego. When he shoots a scene with a biker gang, puttering along beside their Harleys on a vintage AJS, the motorcycle goes so slowly that they have to run the film at half-speed to make it look faster. But Ronan just makes fun of himself. 'I feel like feckin' Mr Bean,' he chuckles. 'On a feckin' lawn mower.'</p> <p>Todd moves Ronan over to the motel's neon sign for what they call 'the golden moment' at sunset. Ronan, the consummate professional, does it all over again, smiling, jumping, falling over, the lot. He gets so excited he loses his balance and flails around in the sand. 'Didjeh see that?' he chortles, 'I fell on my feckin' arse!' Todd, a perfectionist whose favourite two words are 'awesome' and 'dope', finally gets the shot he wants. 'Awesome!' he declares. 'Dope!'</p> <p>There's a round of applause from the cast and crew. One of them yells encouragement. 'Go Roland!'</p> <p>Next morning 'Roland' is up early at the fashionable Mondrian hotel, tucking into a health-freakish egg-white omelette ('for the protein') in preparation for another long day's filming, this time indoors at a nightclub. He's still bemused by the huge crew, the Winnebagos and trucks and police and extras being laid on for him, and by the Hollywood-style star treatment he's getting. 'Every time I'm needed for a shot people are going: \"Talent coming through\", and I'm saying, \"Don't call me talent please, me name's Ronan.\" They gave me a room and said: \"No one can come in here, this room's only for you.\" And I'm saying: \"I don't mind people coming into the room,\" I says: \"I don't care.\" Then they say: \"When you want to have your make-up done, give us five minutes and we'll have the place cleared.\" And I says: \"Man, I don't care. Feckin' hell, we're all here to make a video!\"'</p> <p>He may have spent his entire adult life in a boy band, besieged by screaming schoolgirls, but Ronan, who joined Boyzone at 16 and is breaking free at the ripe old age of 24, swears like a trooper, drinks like a fish (once his work is done), eats like a (health-conscious) horse and he'll speak his mind about anything. He happily berates his former charges, Westlife, for miming, but blames the record company. And he cheerfully tells me over dinner that he once listened on headphones to the Spice Girls' live vocals, while they mimed at an awards show, and that the results were 'like five feckin' cats screechin'.'</p> <p>Ronan, who says he has never mimed - 'swear to God!' - is determined to crack America. He's well aware that the USA is increasingly suspicious of transatlantic imports, although Dido is doing well (thanks to Eminem), Coldplay are starting to break and David Gray is on in every bar. But our big stars just don't seem to translate. Look what happened to Oasis and Robbie Williams. Ronan reckons it's all down to their attitude. 'The reason Oasis and Robbie and bands like that don't happen is that sometimes attitudes like that don't work. If you launch your album with the title The Ego Has Landed, like Robbie did, they don't get that here. It's not funny for them.' Ronan remembers Robbie in his Take That days as 'the sweetest guy you've ever met in your life'. Now he worries about him. 'I like Robbie and I kind of feel for him as well because he's got so big so rapidly in the UK. It's quite scary for him. You know, when you meet him he's only like a little boy, he's like a little lost boy.'</p> <p>Michelle Thomas, the marketing manager from Interscope responsible for Ronan in America, is keeping a watchful eye on the video shoot with a small fluffy dog that she keeps inside her jacket. She doesn't want to draw comparisons, but she thinks he could be as big as Bryan Adams. 'We think Ronan is an amazing artist with a charismatic personality, and that will be our focus,' she says. In the summer, she plans to have Ronan performing live for 'tastemakers' who can spread the word. 'There's not a solo male pop star in the marketplace that is comparable to him,' she goes on. 'Our perception is that he has a very sexy, charismatic thing that happens without even trying. He's cute, but not too cute. Clean cut, but not too clean cut. He's a man's man, not too coiffed, not too perfect, and that gives him a sexy edge we want to capitalise on.' I forget to relay this to Ronan, but I think I already know what he would say. 'Feckin' bollox!'</p> <p>For his own part, Ronan says he is being careful not to change too rapidly, not to grow up too fast after Boyzone. 'I can take too big a step. I can try to be too cool and people won't accept that.' He remembers the time he was photographed in snakeskin trousers. 'I wore 'em last year and I didn't half get a slagging for them, so I'll never wear 'em again! Jeans and a T-shirt - that's as far as I'll ever go.' He admires the way Madonna and U2 constantly reinvent themselves by taking small steps. 'And people are convinced every time. That's a serious talent.' He's aware he has to shed his past cautiously: 'It's hard coming from a boy band. Unless you turn into Robbie Williams and take drugs and drink and fall asleep on the street, you're always going to be labelled with that nice boy band image.'</p> <p>Ronan has already noticed a change in his audience since he went solo. 'For the first time, guys are starting to buy my records - slowly. Girls are still buying them, but they're older girls. I've lost some of the teen audience. I think some of them feel bitter that the fact Boyzone aren't together is because of me, and that's not true. But now I've got guys coming up to me in the street and shaking me by the hand and saying, \"Nice record.\" I've never had that before. People say, \"Me and me girlfriend got married to this song.\" Or \"We kissed to this song.\" Which is pretty groovy!' Ronan felt 'crushed' when his last single ('The Way You Make Me Feel') only went into the charts at number six. Then he noticed his album had gone up 15 places. 'Which is more important. That was a massive step for me. It's brilliant. It means I'm beginning to appeal to an album-buying audience. Which means the audience are getting older.'</p> <p>When Ronan was growing up in Dublin, listening to the records of his older sister and three older brothers, he wanted to be George Michael. The first single he ever bought was 'Last Christmas' by Wham! and his favourite two albums remain Faith and Listen Without Prejudice. These days George remains his role model, but is also his friend, someone to whom he turns for advice. There could be no one better equipped to advise on the tricky transition from teen idol to what the record industry calls a serious artist. Not that Ronan wants to be a serious artist. 'I hate usin' that feckin' term. I'm a pop artist and that's what I'll always be. I don't want to be a \"credible artist\". I'm not going to be feckin' Noel Gallagher. I want to be respected for what I do, but that's different. I don't need to be a credible artist, it doesn't drive me.'</p> <p>What drives Ronan, it seems after spending two days in his company, is the need for his father's approval. 'Me and me dad didn't have a great relationship when we were younger,' he admits. 'We had a good relationship, but it wasn't an affectionate relationship. It was never the arm around the shoulder and \"It'll be OK.\"' Ronan was far from academic but, encouraged by his father, he excelled at sports, especially athletics and Gaelic football. 'But if I didn't win, it wasn't really accepted. And that was hard. But on the other side, I had my mother, who was the most affectionate woman. We were always best friends. And when we lost mam, we needed him, and we didn't have him. And that was really hard.' Looking back, he says he 'lost the plot a bit' after Marie's death from cancer in January 1998 at the age of 52; questioned his faith for a while, too.</p> <p>He still believes in God, still regards himself as a Catholic, and prays for his family every night before bed, but seldom goes to Mass and thinks the Catholic church is 'a joke'. His mother's death, and his father's reaction to it, 'becoming more distant, unable to share his grief with his children', left him lonely, but helped him to grow up. 'It made me become a man. It made me become very independent. At times I felt very alone and that made me more angry towards myself, that I had made myself feel alone. I always wanted to make my parents feel proud of me.' And particularly your father? 'Maybe, because winning was everything to him. Failure wasn't an option.'</p> <p>I ask Ronan, not so long ago the working-class schoolboy with the Billy Whizz hairstyle who sat at the back of the classroom in his brothers' hand-me-down uniforms, unable to afford school books, if his father is proud of him now that he is a millionaire pop star with a beautiful wife and two beautiful children. 'I hope so,' he says quietly. 'But he won't tell me that. Because that's his generation.'</p> <p>In the grief-filled solitude that followed his mother's death, and to the horror of millions of teenage girls, Ronan married Yvonne Connolly, with what many outside observers (none of whom knew him well enough to pass judgment) considered indecent haste. Three years later, their marriage, as far as can be seen from 48 hours with them, would be the envy of any couple. Yvonne has just made a 10,000-mile round trip to spend the weekend with him and now they can't wait to be back home with Jack, who has just turned two, and newly born Marie. 'I miss them terrible. It breaks my heart. Jack clung on to me and cried when I left. 'Daddy don't go!' Jesus Christ, man, that tears you apart. Tears you apart.' Ronan bites his lip. 'It's horrible.'</p> <p>When he auditioned for Boyzone at the age of 16, Ronan sang the Cat Stevens song 'Father and Son', because he knew the words and, although he overheard the instant reaction that 'the blond one can't sing', he got the job and it later became one of Boyzone's seemingly endless string of hit singles.</p> <p>Today Ronan is mostly listening to Aerosmith ('brilliant!'), the Almost Famous soundtrack ('Fan-tastic! Anyone reading this: buy it! It's brilliant!'), Coldplay, David Gray, Toploader, Stereophonics. 'Rock music's in me somewhere,' he laughs. 'Really great music. No good pop bands, though. There's crap pop music around.'</p> <p>I think Ronan is more passionate about music than any other performer I've met. Which is odd for someone who has spent so long as a performing puppet. He talks about music all the time. He sings along to the radio. He's a fan. He says he never had girlfriends at school so, although I know he was a virgin until he met Yvonne, I ask him if he joined a band for the traditional teenage-boy reasons of getting laid, taking recreational drugs and travelling the world. 'I was in a band, man, and I had great fun. I toured the world with great mates and it was great fun, and my God it was rock'n'roll. More rock'n'roll than most feckin' rock'n'roll bands,' he says firmly but vaguely.</p> <p>'But we just didn't feel we had to get up and say it in front of the TV and in newspapers and whatnot. When I was in the band, we had to be careful what we did, because there's young people out there who watch your every move. If you get tattoos, they'll get the same tattoo, if they see you smoking, I'm sure they'll want to smoke because their favourite pop star does it. But we had a lot of fun. And now I've made a family and settled down and I do this because I love music. I feckin' love music. I drive the car home and I'm singin' to me heart's content other people's songs, and I'm sure they're bang out of tune, and I just love it! And Jack sings with me in the back and it's brilliant! Isn't that what music's all about?</p> <p>'I've never done this for the money,' he insists. 'I don't care about it. I spend it as quick as I have it. My biggest extravagance is making sure my family can be with me as much as possible. I care about happiness for my family, and for joy. I love what I do. I love travel, I love meeting people, I love getting up on stage and performing in front of 20,000 people and I love watching people singing the songs back at me. It's unbelievable. Such a buzz! And I want to come over here and give it a go because it's America, the land of bloody opportunity. The streets are paved with gold, as they say. I guess it's just that whole thing of being able to go and conquer America. I believe you always have to set yourself a challenge because otherwise life gets very boring. And I'd hate to think this could ever get boring because I love it too much.'</p> <p>Then Ronan goes to perform his song about 50 more times at the video shoot. Again the crew are impressed. One of them punches a fist in the air and shouts his approval: 'Go Rowan!'</p> <p>That evening, to celebrate the video's successful completion, I go out to dinner with Ronan, George Michael's partner Kenny Goss and the teenage Irish singer Samantha Mumba and her little brother, who are starting work next morning in Steven Spielberg's new movie. It's all very Hollywood. Sam shouldn't be staying up late, but she's a teenage Irish girl and Ronan is her pop hero. At the restaurant, an attractive brunette comes over and greets Ronan like an old friend. Of course, he hasn't got a feckin' clue who she is, especially after about 10 vodka-and-lime-and-sodas. She's Kelly Brook.</p> <p>Then there's another comedy moment. Ronan is trying to order another drink when a peach martini is delivered to the table by a waiter. He explains it has been sent over with the compliments of a man at a nearby table. When Ronan has stopped blushing and finished his steak, he gets up to relieve himself and his mystery admirer starts following him towards the men's room. At which point, we are treated to the bizarre sight of George Michael's boyfriend following Ronan Keating to the men's room in order to rescue him from the attentions of another man. Clearly, Ronan is making his mark in America. They might even get his name right one day.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Under a blazing California sun, amid the Joshua trees of the Mojave desert, ringed by snow-capped mountains, that nice Ronan Keating from Boyzone is being transformed into a rock icon. Or, to be more precise, 'an American rock icon'. That's what it says on the US record label's treatment for the \u00a3300,000 video that will soon launch him on the American public, being shot an hour's drive out of Los Angeles. No clich\u00e9 will be left unturned: there will be Harley-Davidson motorcycles. There will be cacti and tumbleweed. An old man pumping gas by a run-down motel-diner. Ronan will be wearing blue denim and a white T-shirt, like James Dean in Giant. 'His look will be Diesel meets Easy Rider in a Tommy Hilfiger ad,' says the treatment. He will be surrounded by beautiful people representing the beautiful people who will go out and buy Ronan's record. All these things are being made real 'Hollywood style' at an old film set in the desert built by Dennis Hopper. The Harleys and the cacti, the old man and the denims are real enough, even the beautiful people from central casting are real. Whether they really will go out and buy Ronan's record, buy into Ronan-the-rock- icon, is the crucial question. Ronan Keating, like Boyzone, is unknown to the American public. Even the video crew are unsure who he is. The director, a dreadlocked Benny Hill lookalike called Todd, knows who Ronan is, but is unsure who he was. 'I tried to download some Boyzone videos off the internet, but I couldn't find any,' he confesses. 'I don't know how he looked in Boyzone.' Well, we do. He looked like a fresh-faced clean-cut choirboy in a Gucci suit. Not like James Dean. And we're not used to him leaping around like this, impressing the beautiful extras with his boundless enthusiasm for spontaneously jumping off things in a designer junkyard, falling over among the cacti and gurning into the camera. The equally energetic Todd leaps up and down beside the camera like he's in the mosh pit, his dreads flapping as he encourages the dancers to show the same energy as this Irish guy they've, like, never heard of. You might find this hard to believe, but Ronan rocks, he really does. His new single - and US debut - 'Lovin' Each Day' (written by Gregg Alexander of the New Radicals) has loud electric guitars and an anthemic chorus. It's very American.

'Gahd, I love this shit!' he exclaims as the speakers blast out 'Lovin' Each Day' for the umpteenth time. 'It's, like, happy music!'' Everyone likes the song, and everyone likes Ronan.

One of them yells encouragement. 'Go Roland!' Next morning 'Roland' is up early at the fashionable Mondrian hotel, tucking into a health-freakish egg-white omelette ('for the protein') in preparation for another long day's filming, this time indoors at a nightclub. He's still bemused by the huge crew, the Winnebagos and trucks and police and extras being laid on for him, and by the Hollywood-style star treatment he's getting.

I love travel, I love meeting people, I love getting up on stage and performing in front of 20,000 people and I love watching people singing the songs back at me. It's unbelievable. Such a buzz! And I want to come over here and give it a go because it's America, the land of bloody opportunity. The streets are paved with gold, as they say. I guess it's just that whole thing of being able to go and conquer America. I believe you always have to set yourself a challenge because otherwise life gets very boring. And I'd hate to think this could ever get boring because I love it too much.' Then Ronan goes to perform his song about 50 more times at the video shoot. Again the crew are impressed. One of them punches a fist in the air and shouts his approval: 'Go Rowan!' That evening, to celebrate the video's successful completion, I go out to dinner with Ronan, George Michael's partner Kenny Goss and the teenage Irish singer Samantha Mumba and her little brother, who are starting work next morning in Steven Spielberg's new movie. It's all very Hollywood. Sam shouldn't be staying up late, but she's a teenage Irish girl and Ronan is her pop hero. At the restaurant, an attractive brunette comes over and greets Ronan like an old friend. Of course, he hasn't got a feckin' clue who she is, especially after about 10 vodka-and-lime-and-sodas. She's Kelly Brook. Then there's another comedy moment. Ronan is trying to order another drink when a peach martini is delivered to the table by a waiter. He explains it has been sent over with the compliments of a man at a nearby table. When Ronan has stopped blushing and finished his steak, he gets up to relieve himself and his mystery admirer starts following him towards the men's room. At which point, we are treated to the bizarre sight of George Michael's boyfriend following Ronan Keating to the men's room in order to rescue him from the attentions of another man. Clearly, Ronan is making his mark in America. They might even get his name right one day.",

A handful of policemen armed with ancient .303 rifles stand guard uneasily at the top of the hill, dug in behind sandbags. They are waiting - waiting for an invisible enemy to creep through the fragrant pine forests. Any noise could mean nothing. Or it could mean the kind of ambush which killed 27 of their colleagues on Friday night. 'There is no point in pretending. We are scared,' constable Bal Badhum Regmi admitted. 'The problem is they attack in huge numbers. We don't stand a chance.' Across the valleys and remote mountains of rural Nepal, other police officers were last night also weighing their odds of survival. They are not good.

      "bodyText": "Bosnian Croat rebels seize hostages in raid on banks Rioting Bosnian Croat extremists took international and local officials captive inside banks in Mostar and Grude. They threatened to execute one hostage. International representative Wolfgang Petritsch denounced 'these thugs' but added that the situation was calm. Elsewhere in Bosnia, Dutch peacekeepers entered garrisons seized by hardliners demanding a separate Croat state and took away weapons. There was no resistance. Camera Briton arrested A British man found carrying a camera inside a defence ministry compound in Malaysia has been arrested. Defence Minister Najib Tun Razak said it was unlikely the man, aged 32 and wearing a T-shirt and slippers, was a spy. He was not carrying a passport, refused to cooperate and appeared to be mentally unsound. Najib added: 'Even if he were a spy, he will be a foolish one.' Poll protesters on the march More than 50,000 protesters marched through the Tanzanian capital, Dar es Salaam, as one of Africa's most united countries moved further towards possible disintegration, writes James Astill. The marchers wanted a rerun of elections last year in the semi-autonomous Zanzibar islands. Opposition groups say the voting was rigged by the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi Party. Dozens of people were killed last January when a similar demonstration ended in violence. WWI blast A collector was killed by an explosive device from the First World War which went off in his shed at Very, near Metz, France. Police said Eric Foucher, 36, gathered relics in the nearby Verdun forest, site of the bloody battle in 1916. Ecstasy haul A Canadian and a Chinese man were held after Australian police and customs officials found a record 500,000 ecstasy tablets which arrived in Sydney from the Chinese port of Huangpu and were hidden in tins of pineapple. Clinton praises Mother Teresa Former President Bill Clinton sang a hymn at the tomb of Mother Teresa, cuddled babies and danced with children at the Missionaries of Charity orphanage she founded in Calcutta. 'I promised my wife I would come here,' he said. Towering over Sister Nirmala, who succeeded Mother Teresa, Clinton waved at the crowd and said the 32 C heat was 'like Florida'.",

      "body": "<p>'What should be done with Maff?' cried Ian Willmore, media coordinator for Friends of the Earth. ' What should be done with Maff? Maff should be shot in the head, dumped in a trench, fried to a cinder, sprinkled with quicklime and buried with a stake through its heart, that's what should be done with Maff ...and you can quote me on that if you want.'</p> <p>In normal circumstances quotation would be all but pointless. Willmore would be a voice from the green fringe, which could be dismissed by those whose opinions matter with the killer condemnatory sentence: 'No one takes him seriously.' Not this time, I think. The foot and mouth epidemic has had the cheering effect of shifting the fringe to the mainstream.</p> <p>I've never found New Labour politicians and advisers as furious or as willing to talk to Leftie hacks. Undoubtedly the anger has been caused in part by the postponement of elections. But it is elevated by a less partisan contempt for the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and a determination that it should share the fate of millions of beasts. 'We've learned the hard way that the department which gave us BSE is the last organisation you want on your side in a crisis,' said one.</p> <p>The official line is that the fall in the daily count of new cases shows that the slaughter programme is 'beginning to bite'. No one wants to contradict guarded optimism in public. In private, however, many worry about spread rather than numbers. There may be fewer outbreaks but they are popping up all over the country - in Shropshire, Cornwall, and the Peak District. This does not look like an emergency which has been contained. Above all, the strength of the disease in Cumbria terrifies officials. 'I don't know if we can stop it sweeping across to the Humber, however many animals we slaughter,' said one member of the Downing Street crisis team. 'We may have to think about vaccination again.'</p> <p>Opposition to vaccination is the ruling passion of the National Farmers' Union and Maff (the NFU's political wing). If their dogma is overturned both will be humiliated and Maff may die of shame and be replaced by a Ministry for Rural Affairs. Sticking to slaughter until the last cow dies in the last ditch suits their interests, but administrative convenience may not be enough to save Maff when New Labour's confrontation with the Ministry has been so disillusioning.</p> <p>The party came to power as modernisers. In agriculture, as in so much else, 'modernity' meant more of the same. A party adviser described Maff as a dumping ground for civil servants. The wages were lower, the chances of moving on to a better job in Whitehall non-existent. A posting to Maff was the bureaucratic equivalent of a Politburo order to take up duties at a Mongolian power station or - to mix continents, and quite possibly metaphors as well - to check in for an indefinite stay at the Hotel California. 'It was a secretive, depressed place,' he said, 'very suspicious of change, very defensive. New Ministers and new permanent secretaries can't stop the treacle layer of senior civil servants trapping new ideas.'</p> <p>Jack Cunningham, the first Labour Agriculture Minister, at least tried to change the privileges granted to the NFU by the Tories. He also noticed that while his office was a 10 feet square coop without a desk, senior civil servants were housed in some splendour. Cunningham made a fuss and the stories about 'Junket Jack', which were to help finish his career, duly appeared. The Civil Service can be vicious when crossed. 'Expect articles about how Nick Brown failed to heed the sound advice of righteous officials to surface within days,' my new friend predicted.</p> <p>Back-covering briefers will have to work hard. The suicidally honest Michael Meacher blurted out last week that there will be an inquiry when the mess is finally cleared up and was reprimanded for telling the truth. When it comes, as it will, the investigators must ask: why a Maff inspector missed the initial outbreak? Why animal movements were allowed for four days after foot and mouth was discovered? When did Maff officials warn Ministers that trouble was coming? Why were misleading figures on detection and slaughter rates fed to Downing Street? How rigorous was Maff in cracking down on the 'black sheep' smuggling market of subsidy-fiddling farmers? And why was the conclusion that the Army and epidemiologists should be called in at once, which had been reached by the inquiries into the 1967-68 outbreak, ignored?</p> <p>The last question has provoked many accusations in the past few days. But exiles from Maff argue that it should be rephrased. 'Someone should look at all the contingency plans from '68 to the present day,' said one, 'and try to spot the differences. My hunch is that there won't be any.'</p> <p>Maff has been stuck with a slaughter policy since the 1920s when it overrode the protests of small farmers, who saw no need for animals with a minor illness to be massacred, in the interests of big farmers, who wanted to eliminate a disease which reduced auction prices. My colleague Anthony Browne was referred to a study from the 1950s by the Maff press office when he asked if slaughter was the best policy. It was as if all the modern advances in vaccination had never happened. Macedonia and Albania vaccinated successfully to stop the spread of the disease in 1996. But it has not been considered here for fear it would jeopardise a livestock export market worth a paltry \u00a3570 million.</p> <p>Dissent has its risks. The Elm Farm Research Centre, a Berkshire agricultural charity, had to promise vets anonymity when it asked them to discuss the merits of vaccination. Public exposure would threaten their careers. The slaughtermen in the NFU, meanwhile, are presented as the sole representatives of farmers (just as the Countryside Alliance is presented as sole representative of the countryside) though only 53,000 of the 180,000 farmers in England and Wales are members.</p> <p>Farmers' organisations who favour vaccination are shut out. Mike Hart of the Small and Family Farmers Alliance told me how he and other small farming groups had tried to get past Maff and into see Blair to argue against mass slaughter. They gave up after 'hitting the proverbial brick wall'. What we are witnessing is the sanctification of a dubious slaughter policy with little concern for the public interest.</p> <p>Stephen Tindale, who was Meacher's political adviser at the Department of the Environment until earlier this year, is not surprised. He remembered the Government receiving pathetic complaints from farm workers afflicted with depression, lassitude and chronic muscular pains - the effects, they maintained of organo-phosphate sheep dips. Maff officials dismissed their claims. No one knew if the sheep dip was the culprit, they said, but the Institute of Occupational Medicine in Edinburgh was on the case. The Institute duly reported that a link between exposure to sheep dip and 'chronic peripheral neuropathy' [damage to the nervous system] was 'suggested' by its research. Whitehall's Committee on Toxicity preferred to bin the report and uphold the reputation of the agri-chemical industry.</p> <p>They may have been right to do so, I'm not qualified to judge. I do know that a majority of supposedly sovereign consumers do not want GM foods, but public opinion did not stop Maff and Lord Sainsbury bowing to the wishes of the GM conglomerates regardless. Witnesses at Maff meetings described the insouciance of officials as they discussed the slow elimination of organic farming by GM crop contamination.</p> <p>As with sheep dips and organic food, so with foot and mouth. Many have criticised postponing elections and wrecking the tourist industry for the sake of livestock exports, and counted the price in pounds and votes. Fewer have looked at what I can only call the spiritual consequences. For hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, rambling is an escape from regimentation. They have lost the right to roam. They are being told that the slaughter of Herdwick sheep will transform the open fells of the Lake District into a scrubland no one who has loved Wordsworth or followed a Wainwright guide will recognise - and that the Peak District could follow.</p> <p>The absence of a public outcry about restrictions on freedom of movement is a sign of deference which is on a par with the ability of Virgin Train directors to appear in public without bodyguards. A more assertive citizenry would wonder why it is that Albania and Macedonia can vaccinate their way out of foot and mouth when we can't.</p> <p>They might conclude that although the Balkans are afflicted by war, poverty and ethnic cleansing, they have one great advantage over Britain. They don't have Maff.</p>",

      "bodyText": "'What should be done with Maff?' cried Ian Willmore, media coordinator for Friends of the Earth. ' What should be done with Maff? Maff should be shot in the head, dumped in a trench, fried to a cinder, sprinkled with quicklime and buried with a stake through its heart, that's what should be done with Maff ...and you can quote me on that if you want.' In normal circumstances quotation would be all but pointless. Willmore would be a voice from the green fringe, which could be dismissed by those whose opinions matter with the killer condemnatory sentence: 'No one takes him seriously.' Not this time, I think. The foot and mouth epidemic has had the cheering effect of shifting the fringe to the mainstream. I've never found New Labour politicians and advisers as furious or as willing to talk to Leftie hacks. Undoubtedly the anger has been caused in part by the postponement of elections. But it is elevated by a less partisan contempt for the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and a determination that it should share the fate of millions of beasts. 'We've learned the hard way that the department which gave us BSE is the last organisation you want on your side in a crisis,' said one. The official line is that the fall in the daily count of new cases shows that the slaughter programme is 'beginning to bite'. No one wants to contradict guarded optimism in public. In private, however, many worry about spread rather than numbers. There may be fewer outbreaks but they are popping up all over the country - in Shropshire, Cornwall, and the Peak District. This does not look like an emergency which has been contained. Above all, the strength of the disease in Cumbria terrifies officials. 'I don't know if we can stop it sweeping across to the Humber, however many animals we slaughter,' said one member of the Downing Street crisis team. 'We may have to think about vaccination again.' Opposition to vaccination is the ruling passion of the National Farmers' Union and Maff (the NFU's political wing). If their dogma is overturned both will be humiliated and Maff may die of shame and be replaced by a Ministry for Rural Affairs. Sticking to slaughter until the last cow dies in the last ditch suits their interests, but administrative convenience may not be enough to save Maff when New Labour's confrontation with the Ministry has been so disillusioning. The party came to power as modernisers. In agriculture, as in so much else, 'modernity' meant more of the same. A party adviser described Maff as a dumping ground for civil servants. The wages were lower, the chances of moving on to a better job in Whitehall non-existent. A posting to Maff was the bureaucratic equivalent of a Politburo order to take up duties at a Mongolian power station or - to mix continents, and quite possibly metaphors as well - to check in for an indefinite stay at the Hotel California. 'It was a secretive, depressed place,' he said, 'very suspicious of change, very defensive. New Ministers and new permanent secretaries can't stop the treacle layer of senior civil servants trapping new ideas.' Jack Cunningham, the first Labour Agriculture Minister, at least tried to change the privileges granted to the NFU by the Tories. He also noticed that while his office was a 10 feet square coop without a desk, senior civil servants were housed in some splendour. Cunningham made a fuss and the stories about 'Junket Jack', which were to help finish his career, duly appeared. The Civil Service can be vicious when crossed. 'Expect articles about how Nick Brown failed to heed the sound advice of righteous officials to surface within days,' my new friend predicted. Back-covering briefers will have to work hard. The suicidally honest Michael Meacher blurted out last week that there will be an inquiry when the mess is finally cleared up and was reprimanded for telling the truth. When it comes, as it will, the investigators must ask: why a Maff inspector missed the initial outbreak? Why animal movements were allowed for four days after foot and mouth was discovered? When did Maff officials warn Ministers that trouble was coming? Why were misleading figures on detection and slaughter rates fed to Downing Street? How rigorous was Maff in cracking down on the 'black sheep' smuggling market of subsidy-fiddling farmers? And why was the conclusion that the Army and epidemiologists should be called in at once, which had been reached by the inquiries into the 1967-68 outbreak, ignored? The last question has provoked many accusations in the past few days. But exiles from Maff argue that it should be rephrased. 'Someone should look at all the contingency plans from '68 to the present day,' said one, 'and try to spot the differences. My hunch is that there won't be any.' Maff has been stuck with a slaughter policy since the 1920s when it overrode the protests of small farmers, who saw no need for animals with a minor illness to be massacred, in the interests of big farmers, who wanted to eliminate a disease which reduced auction prices. My colleague Anthony Browne was referred to a study from the 1950s by the Maff press office when he asked if slaughter was the best policy. It was as if all the modern advances in vaccination had never happened. Macedonia and Albania vaccinated successfully to stop the spread of the disease in 1996. But it has not been considered here for fear it would jeopardise a livestock export market worth a paltry \u00a3570 million. Dissent has its risks. The Elm Farm Research Centre, a Berkshire agricultural charity, had to promise vets anonymity when it asked them to discuss the merits of vaccination. Public exposure would threaten their careers. The slaughtermen in the NFU, meanwhile, are presented as the sole representatives of farmers (just as the Countryside Alliance is presented as sole representative of the countryside) though only 53,000 of the 180,000 farmers in England and Wales are members. Farmers' organisations who favour vaccination are shut out. Mike Hart of the Small and Family Farmers Alliance told me how he and other small farming groups had tried to get past Maff and into see Blair to argue against mass slaughter. They gave up after 'hitting the proverbial brick wall'. What we are witnessing is the sanctification of a dubious slaughter policy with little concern for the public interest. Stephen Tindale, who was Meacher's political adviser at the Department of the Environment until earlier this year, is not surprised. He remembered the Government receiving pathetic complaints from farm workers afflicted with depression, lassitude and chronic muscular pains - the effects, they maintained of organo-phosphate sheep dips. Maff officials dismissed their claims. No one knew if the sheep dip was the culprit, they said, but the Institute of Occupational Medicine in Edinburgh was on the case. The Institute duly reported that a link between exposure to sheep dip and 'chronic peripheral neuropathy' [damage to the nervous system] was 'suggested' by its research. Whitehall's Committee on Toxicity preferred to bin the report and uphold the reputation of the agri-chemical industry. They may have been right to do so, I'm not qualified to judge. I do know that a majority of supposedly sovereign consumers do not want GM foods, but public opinion did not stop Maff and Lord Sainsbury bowing to the wishes of the GM conglomerates regardless. Witnesses at Maff meetings described the insouciance of officials as they discussed the slow elimination of organic farming by GM crop contamination. As with sheep dips and organic food, so with foot and mouth. Many have criticised postponing elections and wrecking the tourist industry for the sake of livestock exports, and counted the price in pounds and votes. Fewer have looked at what I can only call the spiritual consequences. For hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, rambling is an escape from regimentation. They have lost the right to roam. They are being told that the slaughter of Herdwick sheep will transform the open fells of the Lake District into a scrubland no one who has loved Wordsworth or followed a Wainwright guide will recognise - and that the Peak District could follow. The absence of a public outcry about restrictions on freedom of movement is a sign of deference which is on a par with the ability of Virgin Train directors to appear in public without bodyguards. A more assertive citizenry would wonder why it is that Albania and Macedonia can vaccinate their way out of foot and mouth when we can't. They might conclude that although the Balkans are afflicted by war, poverty and ethnic cleansing, they have one great advantage over Britain. They don't have Maff.",

He joined an architectural practice as a draughtsman and they paid for him to attend college. </p> <p>He needed somewhere to live and could afford a mortgage large enough to buy a house for himself, his mother, brother and sister. Last year he finished his degree at the University of North London. </p> <p>By this time, all three children had left home and he sold his mother's three-bedroom house, bought her a two-bedroom flat, now worth \u00a385,000, and still had money left over. 'The flat is fully paid for, so I do not have that financial burden and am a free agent,' he says. </p> <p>That meant Steven could take time out: 'When I fin ished my degree, I did not want to crack on for the next two years studying part time. I was going to go full time, which is something I have never been able to afford before. But instead, I decided to take a year out.' </p> <p>Already the one-year sabbatical is stretching to two: 'I have had a nice time since I stopped work last July.' He recently came back from a month's snowboarding in Tignes and is planning some labouring work back in the French Alps this summer. Later this year he will fly to America for free because Continental Airlines lost his luggage last year. </p> <p>The one structured part of his sabbatical is attending a bricklaying course. 'Bricklaying is a different side of the architectural coin and I have not had as much site experience as I would like,' he says. Eventually Steven will return to his architectural studies and hopes to start his own small building business: 'Rather than becoming purely an architect, I would like to do my own designs and, if I get enough site experience with bricklaying and labouring, be able to design something and build it as well.' </p> <p>Meanwhile, Steven earns money as he needs it: 'To maintain my frugal yet stress-free lifestyle, I do some freelance draughting.

He joined an architectural practice as a draughtsman and they paid for him to attend college. He needed somewhere to live and could afford a mortgage large enough to buy a house for himself, his mother, brother and sister. Last year he finished his degree at the University of North London. By this time, all three children had left home and he sold his mother's three-bedroom house, bought her a two-bedroom flat, now worth \u00a385,000, and still had money left over. 'The flat is fully paid for, so I do not have that financial burden and am a free agent,' he says. That meant Steven could take time out: 'When I fin ished my degree, I did not want to crack on for the next two years studying part time. I was going to go full time, which is something I have never been able to afford before. But instead, I decided to take a year out.' Already the one-year sabbatical is stretching to two: 'I have had a nice time since I stopped work last July.' He recently came back from a month's snowboarding in Tignes and is planning some labouring work back in the French Alps this summer. Later this year he will fly to America for free because Continental Airlines lost his luggage last year. The one structured part of his sabbatical is attending a bricklaying course. 'Bricklaying is a different side of the architectural coin and I have not had as much site experience as I would like,' he says. Eventually Steven will return to his architectural studies and hopes to start his own small building business: 'Rather than becoming purely an architect, I would like to do my own designs and, if I get enough site experience with bricklaying and labouring, be able to design something and build it as well.' Meanwhile, Steven earns money as he needs it: 'To maintain my frugal yet stress-free lifestyle, I do some freelance draughting. And I am doing small jobs for friends.' This enables him to meet his outgoings: 'I only have to pay my rent of \u00a3250 a month and for my motorcycle. I have no other commit ments.' He has savings to fall back on: \u00a31,000 in Aberdeen Technology fund 'currently worth about \u00a3600', \u00a323,000 in a building society account, and a personal pension with Equitable Life worth \u00a322,850 by the time he stopped contributing.

Feather the nest Parents can now help their children buy their first home without handing over large sums of money for a deposit. The Open Plan Offset Together mortgage from the Woolwich enables parents, grandparents or anyone else to deposit money in an account, which can be set against the interest costs of an Offset loan (the Woolwich's current account mortgage). The parent retains control and is able to withdraw or add money to the account at any time. The offsetting of interest can be used to reduce monthly payments, or if the mortgage holder chooses to pay interest on the full loan, to pay the mortgage off early. The Woolwich charges a cur rent standard variable rate of 6.5 per cent. For further information call 0845 6071111. Help for the aged Older people on low incomes will soon be able to get free help with their tax affairs under a scheme to be piloted by the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group.

What a Toisa Virgin Direct has come bottom in Moneyfacts first annual survey of Tessa only Isas, or Toisas. The Virgin product came last out of 104 Toisas after returning just \u00a39,491.55 on a nominal \u00a39,000 invested a year ago. The best return in the magazine's survey came from Market Harborough Building Society's 90-day notice toisa with \u00a39,678.53 - but this is only available to MHBS's existing Tessa customers. Sun Bank was second with a 3 year fixed Toisa at \u00a39,652.50.

Three years ago, for example, while living in France, she dreamt about an emaciated elephant turning up in the field next to her house. Following procedures outlined in her new work, The Dream Catchers Handbook , she tried to work out what the elephant symbolised. 'It said: \"I'm grey and wrinkled, thin and hungry.

It was not a great time for her. Always someone who put money aside - up to \u00a3800 per month at times for pension planning - she was getting to the bottom of the barrel financially. Fire, flood and high interest rates had damaged the property investments she had built up. Instead of getting the comfortable fifties she had been on course for, she had to earn money again - not always easy at that age. </p> <p> But then she thought more about dreams - and started to organise therapists and counsellors she had once trained into an organisation, the <a href=\"http://www.catchadream.net\">Dream Catchers</a> to help people understand their dreams. They can even discuss them on a 'Dreamline' (0906 734 0906) for \u00a31 a minute. </p> <p> Then she went on to write her book. She loves the subject of dreams, but also hopes it will make money for her. Waking dreams are not enough: 'I have wished for a rich man to come along and look after my pension rights so I wouldn't have to worry about my old age.' </p> <p> The child of working-class parents from Christchurch, she was always aware of the value of money. 'At three, I wanted a walkie-talkie doll - and I had to save my pocket money to pay for half of it. This is the New Zealand pioneer work ethic.' </p> <p> Her parents moved around following the fruit and vegetable business, and McLean went to 14 different schools: 'That taught me to get on with a lot of different people.

      "bodyText": "The London Stock Exchange has found a new headquarters. It will rent a new building in the controversial Paternoster Square development, a bell ringer's throw from St Paul's Cathedral. The news will come as a huge relief to the Corporation of London, the Square Mile's local authority and landlord. Last week it was reported that the Stock Exchange was poised to sever its 200-year link with the Square Mile for a new home in Canary Wharf, the east London office complex. The Stock Exchange is to pay Paternoster's owner, Japanese conglomerate Mitsubishi, about \u00a312 million per year to lease the 220,000 sq ft King Edward's Court for more than 20 years. The deal should be complete within a few weeks, according to sources at Mitsubishi and the Stock Exchange. For 40 years Paternoster Square has been at the centre of a row between design connoisseurs, who hated its brutal concrete structures for obliterating views of St Paul's, and developers. Those controversial buildings have gone and Paternoster is now being redeveloped. The new offices will not be ready for occupation for at least 18 months.",

      "byline": "William Keegan",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The Bank of England's decision to cut interest rates by 0.25 per cent to 5.5 per cent last week was most welcome, and is an example for the European Central Bank to follow when it meets on Thursday. </p> <p>Judging from the statement that accompanied the rate cut, the Monetary Policy Committee managed to agree on it without the need for a penalty shoot-out. There were no indications of dissent from the official message, which was that 'while growth in final domestic demand has remained firm, there are downside risks to UK activity from the slowdown in the global economy, the recent fall in equity markets and, in the short run, from foot-and-mouth disease'. </p> <p>It should never be forgotten that the MPC's official brief is to achieve an inflation target of 2.5 per cent. Managing demand in the economy is a secondary consideration in order to come as close as possible towards that target. </p> <p>The story of the last two years or so has been one where inflation has persistently undershot the expectations of the committee at large, although not of a significant minority of its members. In announcing the rate cut the MPC stressed: 'Inflation is currently below target, and is expected to remain so for a while. Price and cost pressures continue to be subdued... [pay] settlements and earnings growth have so far remained moderate. In addition, the strength of sterling continues to exert a dampening effect on inflation.' </p> <p>In cutting rates the MPC has certainly pleased the Treasury, which could not in all conscience say that the benign picture of the economy and its prospects that it painted in the Budget documents a month ago can be relied on to continue. Indeed, so worried have officials been about the deteriorating international scene that, had they had the choice, they would probably have urged an election on 3 May. </p> <p>One can easily imagine an official adding in pencil: 'After that, Prime Minister and Chancellor, you are on your own.' </p> <p>In an ideal world they would have wanted an interest rate cut when the MPC last pronounced, on the day after the Budget.

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England's decision to cut interest rates by 0.25 per cent to 5.5 per cent last week was most welcome, and is an example for the European Central Bank to follow when it meets on Thursday. Judging from the statement that accompanied the rate cut, the Monetary Policy Committee managed to agree on it without the need for a penalty shoot-out. There were no indications of dissent from the official message, which was that 'while growth in final domestic demand has remained firm, there are downside risks to UK activity from the slowdown in the global economy, the recent fall in equity markets and, in the short run, from foot-and-mouth disease'. It should never be forgotten that the MPC's official brief is to achieve an inflation target of 2.5 per cent. Managing demand in the economy is a secondary consideration in order to come as close as possible towards that target. The story of the last two years or so has been one where inflation has persistently undershot the expectations of the committee at large, although not of a significant minority of its members. In announcing the rate cut the MPC stressed: 'Inflation is currently below target, and is expected to remain so for a while. Price and cost pressures continue to be subdued... [pay] settlements and earnings growth have so far remained moderate. In addition, the strength of sterling continues to exert a dampening effect on inflation.' In cutting rates the MPC has certainly pleased the Treasury, which could not in all conscience say that the benign picture of the economy and its prospects that it painted in the Budget documents a month ago can be relied on to continue. Indeed, so worried have officials been about the deteriorating international scene that, had they had the choice, they would probably have urged an election on 3 May. One can easily imagine an official adding in pencil: 'After that, Prime Minister and Chancellor, you are on your own.' In an ideal world they would have wanted an interest rate cut when the MPC last pronounced, on the day after the Budget. But that would have been embarrassing all round. One of the main motives behind official Treasury backing for the independence of the MPC is the knowledge that interest rate cuts, when under the control of the Chancellor, all too often took place in Budget week, for blatantly political reasons. It is noteworthy that the latest cut occurs at a time when official figures show that retail sales have been rising fast, and when the proliferation of restaurants, bars and speculative building in London is deeply reminiscent of the height of the Lawson boom of 1988. But what matters for policymakers is not the recent past, or even the present, but where they see the economy going from here. And when the MPC ends its pronouncement with the statement: 'The committee will continue to monitor the downside risks carefully', you can be sure that it is ready to cut again should the world economic scene deteriorate further. But before we get on to that, a word about the latest round of musical chairs at the MPC. The outgoing member, DeAnne Julius, deserves full praise for the stand she has taken in persistently voting for rate cuts on the grounds that the inflationary risks in recent years have been exaggerated.

The move will raise fears that an MSN/Pendragon tie-up will dominate online car sales. But Brewer said: 'We will involve other dealers in the future if it makes sense.' The site will take on Virgin and Direct Line's Jam Jar.",

      "body": "<p>The thundering herd doesn't take taxis these days. Staff at Merrill Lynch, the global investment bank, who for years have swaggered under their bullish nom de plume, were recently ordered to take public transport instead. And, in a further sign of just how grim life is becoming for the City's brightest stars, the herd has now been told to fly economy class. </p> <p>Not that their counterparts at Credit Suisse First Boston can laugh. They've been ordered to keep the cost of celebration dinners after clinching deals to below \u00a37,000 a time. </p> <p>At least Icarus's descent was a quick one. But the fall to earth of thousands of high-flying London bankers doesn't promise to be so speedy. For now the City's leading financial institutions are playing a waiting game, desperately trying not to sack people in the hope that if they can hold out for another few months market conditions will improve. </p> <p>Certainly Merrill is keen to avoid the mistakes it made during the Asian crisis of 1997-98, when it sacked 3,000 employees only to have to start hiring again shortly afterwards as market conditions recovered. Slowly, however, the Square Mile is starting to reject such a Pollyannaish view of the world, and clamping down on the cost of dinners or travel may not be enough. </p> <p>Last week the Centre for Economics and Business Research predicted that 20,000 City jobs will go by the end of next year as a result of the slump in global capital markets. A further 10,000 people are likely to be lost in support services. The CEBR described this as a 'mild setback after a strong boom'. </p> <p>But some in the banking world are now thinking the unthinkable: that things won't blow over in a few months as it becomes clear that a decade-long bull run is ending. </p> <p>One leading investment banker said: 'The past three stock market downturns have been short and sharp. But this time it could be longer and slower. This may be the time when people cut deeper. There will be light lay-offs at first, but over the next two quarters this could go right across the board if things don't change.' </p> <p>The flow of news from the United States doesn't offer much succour for the City. Last Wednesday it was the turn of market-maker Knight Trading to stun the financial sector. The company said its first-quarter earnings would be half the amount it had estimated earlier because share dealing has dried up in the US due to its plunging stock markets. This year alone the Nasdaq, the market for hi-tech stocks, has lost a third of its value. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 12 per cent over the same period. Online brokers have been some of the first in the financial community to feel the pinch as a result of investors losing faith in the markets. Charles Schwab, Ameritrade and CSFBdirect have all announced large-scale job cuts in recent weeks. </p> <p>And as investors have turned away, the big banks' investment arms, the divisions that stitch together the multi-billion pound, headline grabbing mergers and acquisitions - for which they earn millions of pounds in fees - have taken a hammering. </p> <p>Last month Bear Stearns revealed it was to close one of its US offices, with the loss of 400 jobs, after its investment banking arm suffered a drop of nearly 60 per cent in revenues. Last Monday Citigroup, the world's biggest bank, which employs 230,000 people world wide, announced it was cutting 'several hundred' investment banking jobs. </p> <p>Meanwhile the two giants of the financial sector - Morgan Stanley Dean Witter (MSDW) and Goldman Sachs - announced that investment banking revenues were down for the first quarter of this year. </p> <p>MSDW's investment banking revenues crashed nearly 30 per cent over the quarter. The bank put out a statement admitting that it was evaluating its staffing levels after the Wall Street Journal reported that it might lay off 2.5 per cent of its workforce. Goldman must be considering a similar move after its profits were shaved by a painful 13 per cent over the first quarter, while those at Lehman Brothers slid 28 per cent. </p> <p>Despite huge consolidation, the slump in the markets means there are now too many banks chasing too little work. As share prices plunge companies look to restructure internally to cut costs, rather than expanding through acquisition, with expensive financial help. </p> <p>'The values become so uncertain you don't know whether in a week's time you're still paying the right price,' one leading investment banker explained. And, as a company's paper worth crashes, its ability to do deals is jeopardised. </p> <p>'This is a cyclical business. It's very sensitive to stock market cycles,' the banker said. </p> <p>Figures released last week show how dependent the investment banking community is on buoyant capital markets. As brokers' screens flashed red during the first three months of this year, the volume of global mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) crashed. According to an analysis by Computasoft Research, global M&amp;A deals were down 54 per cent compared with the first quarter of last year. The value of deals transacted over the quarter came to $480 billion, compared with more than $1,000bn during the same period last year. </p> <p>Computasoft found that European M&amp;A activity was down 49 per cent on the previous year's first-quarter figures. Or, put it another way - the big banks pulled off only just over 6,000 M&amp;A deals. The last time deal volumes were this low was at the tail end of the Asian crisis. </p> <p>Significantly, as the deals have dried up, the investment banks have scrambled to salvage their reputations. In moves that highlight how ugly the situation is becoming, banks have started to fight to be associated with the few deals around. The more deals a bank does, the higher its placing in the M&amp;A league tables, boosting its credentials. </p> <p>As a result, the likes of Computasoft are being asked to change key dates or value the deals differently to make the banks look better. Michael Maclure, a Computasoft director, said: 'We've come under more pressure this quarter than any other.' </p> <p>This is not surprising. M&amp;A activity was seen as the last defence for the banking world. As investors have stopped dealing and the equity and bond markets have almost completely dried up, the banks haven't been able to rely on flotations or debt offerings to swell their coffers. </p> <p>The great conveyor belt for flotations over the past two years, the telecoms, media and technology (TMT) sector, is now a bombed-out landscape as one by one the titans of the new economy - Cisco, Intel, Lucent, Microsoft, Nortel, and Oracle, to name just six - have lined up to issue profits warnings and puncture the TMT bubble. </p> <p>'People ask me what's going to be the big thing this year and I say \"nothing\",' said Gilbert Toppin, an e-business expert with consultant Deloitte &amp; Touche. 'People got real this year. Value is back in vogue, profits are back in vogue. Organisations are taking a breather: they're not looking at speculative ventures this year.' </p> <p>This is bad news for those banks who believed the new economy dream would last forever. One seasoned financial public relations manager said: 'There's an awful lot of nervousness around. CSFB had been staffing up very aggressively to cope with the number of initial public offerings (IPOs) they expected to be involved with. </p> <p>'They took out three whole pages in the FT only a few months ago to promote all the IPOs they've been involved in. But now there isn't any work for them.' </p> <p>Admittedly, the banks are finding some work advising companies trying to sell assets to raise cash, but it is not enough. 'It doesn't even begin to compensate for the lack of M&amp;A activity,' one investment banker said. </p> <p>So now the City is in limbo, waiting nervously to see what happens next. The thundering herds grazing around the watering holes of the Square Mile continue to refute the age old truism that when Wall Street sneezes London catches a cold. But the omens don't look good. </p> <p>Last Thursday Merrill Lynch Investment Managers, the thundering bulls' fund management arm, announced it was making redundant 80 employees, a third of its UK IT staff.

Barclays Stockbrokers, too, is to cut 5 per cent of its 1,800 staff. </p> <p>A tsunami starts with the smallest waves.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Ten years ago this week Graham Kelly, then head of the Football Association, emerged into the spring sunshine from the darkened corridors of the FA's Mayfair headquarters clutching a thick document called 'The blueprint for the future of football'. </p> <p>It was a suitably worthy tome from a crusty conservative organisation which had its roots in Victorian amateurism. And Kelly himself, a softly spoken former bank clerk and failed Blackpool FC reserve goalkeeper, hardly looked or sounded like a revolutionary. </p> <p>Amid all the usual talk about tending the grass roots and helping the England national team, Kelly included in his Blueprint a bombshell - the ruthless proposal that the FA should set up a rival competition to the long-established 92-club Football League. Twelve of the country's most popular clubs joined at once. Within weeks another half-dozen followed suit. The Premier League was born. </p> <p>Their motivation was, of course, money. As members of the Football League, the best supported clubs had to share the revenue they got from television with all the other League clubs. It meant the likes of Manchester United earned less than \u00a340,000 a year as their share of television rights sales negotiated centrally by the Football League. </p> <p>Manchester United chairman Martin Edwards, one of the moving spirits behind the breakaway, complained that the smaller clubs among the League's 92 were 'bleeding the game to death'; they were not viable as businesses and ought to be 'put to sleep'. For almost a decade he had been looking for a way of paying off the \u00a3500,000 debt he had taken on in order to consolidate his control of the club. He had turned to Sir Roland Smith - the first major figure brought into a football boardroom from the City - to prepare United for flotation. </p> <p>The City was sceptical. Tottenham Hotspur had gone public in 1983, but had bombed as a business. Football clubs were seen as the ultimate basket cases - beset with the soaring cost of players' wages and, in addition, facing the vast expense of rebuilding their stadiums in the wake of 1989's Hillsborough disaster, when 96 fans died. </p> <p>The only way forward was to boost revenues from the linked areas of television rights sales, merchandising and sponsorship. And that meant breaking away from the Football League. </p> <p>Edwards' predicament coincided with Kelly's arrival at the FA from the League during a bitter bureaucratic turf war between the game's two governing bodies. Divisions were deep and stretched back to when the League embraced professionalism a century or more before. </p> <p>The League had proposed a merger - an idea popular among many fans and at the game's grass-roots. But the amateur worthies who ran the FA council saw it as a threat - nothing less than an attempted takeover. Kelly, keen to make his mark at the FA, saw off the merger and then turned the tables. </p> <p>Throughout the Eighties previous plots hatched by Edwards and others to form a breakaway league had foundered, partly on opposition from the FA as well as from the Football League. </p> <p>Kelly, once the gamekeeper, turned poacher with a vengeance. Irving Scholar, chairman of Tottenham and a man as eager as Edwards to break away, was later to say that it was the FA's stamp of respectability that had enabled the Premier League to get off the ground. </p> <p>From the start Kelly had seen that television money would be crucial to the finances of the new 'Premiership'. (The inevitable legal tussle with the rump Football League - which went into receivership when the big clubs left - meant that the FA could not use 'League' in its title.) The Blueprint specified that 'one live game every week' would be shown on television. At the time it was thought that this would mean a deal with ITV, which had held the rights contract to the old football League and where Greg Dyke, then ITV's head of sport, was handling negotiations. </p> <p>The outline of a deal was already clear. Dyke was prepared to pay at least \u00a320 million for the rights. This was roughly double what ITV had paid in the past. More importantly the money would be shared by the Premiership clubs, giving them \u00a31 million each, compared with the few tens of thousands they had when the money had been split between all 92 Football League clubs. </p> <p>At Manchester United, Edwards and Smith thought this vast leap in television revenue would be enough to interest the City. The flotation, held back until after the Blueprint was published on the grounds that United were playing in the European Cup Winners' Cup final, went ahead in May 1991. The float valued the club at \u00a347 million, but it was not a great success. Some of the shares remained unsubscribed. </p> <p>A year later the City's enthusiasm for Manchester United plc began to pick up. The reason was that the television deal awarded the Premiership not to ITV, as expected, but to BSkyB, which had paid what was then regarded as the staggering sum of \u00a3304m for a five-year deal. This guaranteed United around \u00a33m a year - a hundredfold increase on the previous Football League deal. A 30 per cent increase in ticket prices, a new multi-million sponsorship deal and investment in the goldmine of replica shirt sales meant that the plc was soon one of the darlings of the City, boosted by success on the pitch and weekly dollops of free positive publicity in the sports sections of the papers. </p> <p>The amazing turn-round of Manchester United encouraged others to pile in. Within days of the deal with Sky, Sir John Hall bought a controlling stake in Newcastle United for about \u00a33m. Five years later, after flotation, the club was valued at more than \u00a3100m. New and financially astute directors ousted or joined the traditional worthies in club boardrooms up and down the country. </p> <p>It was the age of the 'football fat cats'. But the real winners were to be BSkyB. Before buying the Premier League rights the company had been facing bankruptcy. After the deal, chief executive Sam Chisholm announced that it was 'like Christmas every day' as subscriptions rolled in. Football's role as the most valuable rights property in the television business was confirmed. It was the 'driver' - the only type of programming that could be guaranteed to sell dishes. Sky's effective owner, Rupert Murdoch, described the Premiership as the 'battering ram' which had got pay-TV off the ground in the UK. In 1996 the deal was renewed, with Sky paying \u00a3670m to hang on to the 'crown jewels' of the pay-TV business. </p> <p>The 1996 deal with Sky saw football shares soar as aggressive marketing and branding operations kicked in, and on talk of yet more, vast, new revenues from the innovation of pay-per-view. Man Utd began to describe itself as a 'world brand' to rival McDonald's, and laid plans for chains of shops, branded fast-food outlets and even theme parks around the world. Eventually Sky moved to protect its investment by bid ding to buy Man Utd. Football shares went through the roof as Sky's rivals lined up to buy other clubs: NTL at Newcastle; Granada at Liverpool; Carlton at Arsenal.

The real world - that is, anywhere outside the City of London - must have rubbed its eyes in disbelief last week on the news that a leading investment bank, CSFB, was restricting its staff to such a miserly amount for celebratory nosh-ups. </p> <p>Are we really supposed to take pity on people who can happily blow more than three times the average monthly wage on a swanky supper? No wonder the public perception of City professionals is so low, when they seem determined to confirm the worst stereotype - stuck-up toffs who know the price of everything and the value of nothing. The natural reaction from outside the Square Mile's cloud-cuckoo-land would justifiably be: who cares if they all lose their jobs? </p> <p>This would be understandable, but wrong. Job losses in the City are a cause for general concern every bit as real as the plight of farmers ravaged by foot-and-mouth. </p> <p>The banks and brokers are keeping a stiff upper lip so far, with denials that massive redundancies are looming, but the reality will soon dawn on them. The City lives or dies by the deal, and if the number of takeovers, mergers and acquisitions is drying up (as it most certainly has this year) it will not be long before that is reflected in lay-offs. Salary and bonus levels, set during the good times, cannot be justified when things begin to turn down. </p> <p>The big banks and broking houses are pinning all their hopes on an autumn recovery, on the assumption that a soft landing in the US will be the prelude to a recovery in the M&amp;A markets in corporate Europe. But there is no guarantee this will be the case - many experts predict we are in the middle of a raging bear market that could last for months or even years. Suddenly the forecast by the Council for Economics and Business Research of 10,000 job losses in the main financial markets this year, with a knock-on in support services of a similar number next year, looks conservative. </p> <p>That should worry us all. For all its flash spivvery and snotty extravagance, the City is increasingly the power-house of the British economy. It fuels the local economy of the South East ('local' it may be in British terms, but the area within the M25 commands a bigger economy than many of the world's sovereign states). As many as 300,000 jobs depend on it, directly or indirectly, and as the main force behind 'invisible' financial products it comprises the biggest single item in British exports. Some may look back nostalgically to the days when we gave the world steel, ships and engines, but we are now inescapably a service economy, and the City is at the heart of that. </p> <p>On a human level, too, job losses in the Square Mile are to be regretted. It may not look like a proper job, prancing around a trading floor in a stripy jacket waving your arms wildly, but it brings home the bacon to households around the country. City traders made redundant are just as liable to depression, sickness and suicide as any Cumbrian fell-farmer. </p> <p>What City workers do have, of course, is a greater cushion against unemployment. The bonuses and commissions from the good years should see them through the hard times ahead, and there is some evidence that they have been wiser this time than in previous downturns, putting their money in bricks and mortar rather than in rich boys' (and girls') toys. There is much more residual value in the country house or the Chelsea apartment than in the mid-engine Porsche. </p> <p>So when next you read of a barrow-boy trader struggling to get by on \u00a3250K, or an Old Etonian investment banker down to his last million, grin and bear it. Without knowing it, and certainly without intending it, they are essential to the wellbeing of us all.</p>",

Job losses in the City are a cause for general concern every bit as real as the plight of farmers ravaged by foot-and-mouth. The banks and brokers are keeping a stiff upper lip so far, with denials that massive redundancies are looming, but the reality will soon dawn on them. The City lives or dies by the deal, and if the number of takeovers, mergers and acquisitions is drying up (as it most certainly has this year) it will not be long before that is reflected in lay-offs. Salary and bonus levels, set during the good times, cannot be justified when things begin to turn down. The big banks and broking houses are pinning all their hopes on an autumn recovery, on the assumption that a soft landing in the US will be the prelude to a recovery in the M&amp;A markets in corporate Europe. But there is no guarantee this will be the case - many experts predict we are in the middle of a raging bear market that could last for months or even years. Suddenly the forecast by the Council for Economics and Business Research of 10,000 job losses in the main financial markets this year, with a knock-on in support services of a similar number next year, looks conservative. That should worry us all. For all its flash spivvery and snotty extravagance, the City is increasingly the power-house of the British economy. It fuels the local economy of the South East ('local' it may be in British terms, but the area within the M25 commands a bigger economy than many of the world's sovereign states). As many as 300,000 jobs depend on it, directly or indirectly, and as the main force behind 'invisible' financial products it comprises the biggest single item in British exports. Some may look back nostalgically to the days when we gave the world steel, ships and engines, but we are now inescapably a service economy, and the City is at the heart of that. On a human level, too, job losses in the Square Mile are to be regretted. It may not look like a proper job, prancing around a trading floor in a stripy jacket waving your arms wildly, but it brings home the bacon to households around the country. City traders made redundant are just as liable to depression, sickness and suicide as any Cumbrian fell-farmer. What City workers do have, of course, is a greater cushion against unemployment. The bonuses and commissions from the good years should see them through the hard times ahead, and there is some evidence that they have been wiser this time than in previous downturns, putting their money in bricks and mortar rather than in rich boys' (and girls') toys. There is much more residual value in the country house or the Chelsea apartment than in the mid-engine Porsche. So when next you read of a barrow-boy trader struggling to get by on \u00a3250K, or an Old Etonian investment banker down to his last million, grin and bear it. Without knowing it, and certainly without intending it, they are essential to the wellbeing of us all.",

Because it comes from outside Europe, argues Tesco, it is legitimate. </p> <p>Two years ago the battleground shifted from the supermarket shelves to the law courts.

She added that when a brand owner failed to control its distribution tightly, its rights would be exhausted. The tricky bit - what constitutes failure to control distribution and therefore consent to parallel importation - has been sent back to national courts. They must decide whether manufacturers have the right to block cheap imports. </p> <p>At the very least, her opinion signals a shift in favour of parallel importers even if it is not the unmitigated victory hailed so loudly by Tesco. The supermarket won the battle for positive press coverage, which is surprising since in private it was admitting only a week ago that it didn't expect any favours from the European judge. For 10 minutes its internal phone network sagged under the weight of self-congratulation. Of three drafted press releases, the one trumpeting victory was retrieved from the wastebin. 'They were unbelievably quick off the mark,' sighs Alan Christie, Levi's public affairs head in Europe. 'We spent all day asking people to look more carefully at the judgment, all 37 pages of it. They have based their claim of victory on one paragraph.' Equally, Levi's seems to base its hopes on a single but different paragraph (number 87, if you're asking). </p> <p>One thing is sure: hostilities will escalate because Levi's insists the issue is not about the price tag but about the future of the entire company. 'We don't want to fight the war over price,' says Christie. 'It is about us trying to differentiate our brand. We are trying to sell to people who think that Levi's is more than just a pair of jeans. Tesco customers only think they are getting a bargain because of the brand image. But the very fact that Tesco sells them undermines the image.' </p> <p>Soon, Christie fears, the damage done to the brand will be such that nobody will want them, even at Tesco prices. That really worries a company that has seen lean times in a very fickle fashion market. The fourth-quarter results for 2000, published in January, celebrated the fact that the net sales decline had slowed. 'When this [dispute] started nearly five years ago we were in a very different position to the one we are in now. Levi's were number one in Europe, counterfeit Levi's were number two, and parallel imported Levi's were number three,' Christie explains. 'We have been through more than two years of relative business decline. The desirability of the brand has been eroded. I think we are starting to come out of it, and that's why this issue is so important to us. We are trying to rebuild interest in our brand. We want to be wanted.' </p> <p>Few things are as unattractive as desperation. Exclusivity is crucial at the luxury end of the designer market. Why else would anybody pay the price of a week in Ibiza for a pair of the latest jeans and a jacket? Christie says Levi's isn't 'snooty', just aware of the importance of desirability. It is, he says, trying very hard to cut off the supply. </p> <p>It is also getting tough with existing stockists, including John Lewis, a retail bear to Tesco's bull. John Lewis is not allowed to stock the latest must-have 'engineered' Levi's. It has been told it must take a certain number of related Levi's goods for each pair of 501s. Other retailers have been given three months to 'upgrade' their retail environment and service levels, or else lose Levi's altogether. </p> <p>Christie admits it is exactly the kind of attitude that fosters resentment, but he is unrepentant: 'We are completely consistent in our approach. This isn't about us being snooty because we are not Armani, but different retailers serve different customers.'</p> <p>The judgment itself has failed to provide the clarity that trademark owners and parallel importers alike were hoping for.

By the weekend, at least four competing subscription delivery services had been announced, and musicians themselves were complaining that their interests were being woefully overlooked. </p> <p>The flurry of deals and partnerships intended to capitalise on Napster's demise as a free service is intended to make it easier to sell and listen to songs online. But there are fears that so many competing services will only complicate matters further. </p> <p>Last Monday, AOL Time Warner, Bertelsmann and EMI announced the founding of MusicNet, a new platform to be distributed by AOL using RealNetworks software. Then Vivendi's Universal Music Group, the world's largest music company, reached a tentative agreement to acquire the online service EMusic to use as a platform for its Duet partnership with Sony and bought Yahoo into the deal. </p> <p>The Duet service is expected to launch this summer with streaming music (ie tracks can be heard 'live') and plans to add downloads shortly thereafter. The company says it will have thousands of songs on the internet available in a fee-based subscription model. </p> <p>Next, MTVi Group, the Internet arm of the cable music channel, launched a service that allows people to download songs - for a price - from all five major record companies. And Microsoft's internet service, MSN, announced that it is starting a radio-like service called MSN Music that will deliver 'near CD quality' music over the web. </p> <p>Of course, each competing alliance believes it has the technology and appeal to become the dominant force in online music distribution and the music industry is expected to spend several months experimenting with different models for providing music on the net. It remains to be seen if web users will pay for music they once downloaded for nothing. </p> <p>Napster chief executive Hank Barry says he expects fewer than 3 million of the service's 60 million registered users to pay for it. But Nicholas Butterworth, head of MTVi, expressed confidence that consumers would be won over. 'We are going to do everything we can to make music sales go up,' he said. 'There is clearly a lot of demand for digital music.' </p> <p>The announcements came just as the US Senate began hearings into the business practices of the music industry and its future online. Already faced with criticism that it has dragged its feet in offering music online, the industry has put the deals together in a hurry. </p> <p>The principals of the MusicNet deal say it only came together two weeks ago after a series of all-night negotiations. </p> <p>But several key parties have apparently been left out of the discussions. Before the labels can launch these services, they must come to terms with the songwriters and composers over licences to their work. Until recently an ongoing battle between record labels and songwriters has attracted little attention, mostly because it revolves around the complex mechanisms of music copyright law. But the consequences of this dispute could be even more important to the music industry than the question of digital music. </p> <p>The clash between music publishers and record companies over control of digital copyright frames an even larger question about the relationship between the creators of content - musicians and songwriters - and the industry. Before the Senate last week, singer Alanis Morissette and former Eagles musician Don Henley testified that the industry had not heeded the wishes of musicians, many of whom feel they are held to punishing contracts by corporations that have little interest in anything but the bottom line. Morrisette even ventured that 'this so-called \"piracy\" may have actually been working in musicians' favour'. </p> <p>Dozens of major artists, including Henley, Eric Clapton, Tom Waits, Tom Petty and country legend Merle Haggard have formed a trade group, the Recording Artists Coalition, to demand better contracts, better copyright protection and new rules on ownership of their songs. </p> <p>'The ones making the music aren't the ones making the money,' says Haggard. 'The artist pays for everything and ends up with nothing. The big boys with the cigars, they get it all. Not only do they cheat you on the way in, they rob you on the way out.' </p> <p>The growing anti-industry sentiment was expressed by Bono last month when he was invited to induct Island records founder Chris Blackwell into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in New York. 'You think you could run Coca-Cola,' he told the assembly of music business suits, 'but you couldn't. You could only rob it.' </p> <p>Singer Courtney Love recently captured the industry's attention when she sued to break her contract with Vivendi Universal, accused the industry of 'corrupt' accounting practices and claimed record labels deducted exorbitant fees in order to ensure that even successful artists barely recouped their advances. Love says she has received support from hundreds of artists, including Prince. </p> <p>At issue is the record industry's business model, which typically holds artists to seven-album deals. They are structured so that one or two successful acts pay for the hundreds that fail. Music executives say artists fail to consider that the cost of doing business is skyrocketing, squeezing already slim profit margins. They dismiss the complaints as sour grapes from a collection of ageing acts whose recent albums have failed to sell. </p> <p>Not so, say the musicians, they were taken advantage of. Songwriter Tom Waits says his first contract paid him only 15 cents per copy sold in the US. 'This thing is very unfair, and the companies know it. You're very young when they push this contract in front of you. It's like you're some 15-year-old girl and everybody's saying, \"Baby, you're so beautiful. Please join our modelling agency\". All you see is runways and makeup and sequins and hair spray. You have no idea what you're signing.' </p> <p>Some in the industry concede that they are unpopular and are losing the public relations battle with disgruntled musicians. 'We are like the tobacco companies,' says one executive. 'No one really likes us.' To avoid testing the law in the past, record companies have typically rewritten the contracts of disgruntled stars, offering higher royalty rates and other concessions. </p> <p>Angry artists began to organise after discovering that lobbyists acting for the industry had persuaded lawmakers to pass a Bill that would prevent artists from ever gaining control of their recordings.

Hart was in command of the police operation that day. The riots resulted in \u00a32 million worth of damage in the City, 50 injuries and scores of arrests.</p> <p>Activists have dubbed this year's demonstration 'May Day Monopoly' after the property-buying board game. Last week organisers distributed a game guide on the internet, identifying targets on the famous Monopoly streets. Although none of these is in the City, police believe the demonstrators are unlikely to turn down the chance to hit at the heart of British capitalism.</p> <p>Senior officers in the Metropolitan Police, which has responsibility for the rest of London, have admitted they still do not know who is organising the demonstration, and no idea where they will strike. So far there have been no arrests in connection with May Day, despite last weekend's raid on a disused button factory which police claim was being used for 'training' up to 500 activists.</p> <p>Assistant Commissioner Mike Todd told The Observer: 'It is extremely difficult to prepare for this sort of event because of the complete unpredictability of those taking part.

      "bodyText": "Police last night admitted that they had 'no idea' as to the identities of the people planning the biggest demonstration in London for decades, despite fears that next month's anti-capitalist May Day protests could descend into mayhem and anarchy. Amid warnings that riots could break out across the capital when activists from around the world descend, senior police officers have been told that their jobs are on the line if they fail to contain violence or damage. Senior detectives say the City force's top two policemen, Commissioner Perry Nove and his assistant James Hart, have been told by the Home Office that they will be held personally responsible if officers lose control of demonstrators entering the Square Mile. Nove was carpeted by Jack Straw, the Home Secretary, and Eddie George, the Governor of the Bank of England, for losing control of the 'Carnival against Capitalism' in the City two years ago. Hart was in command of the police operation that day. The riots resulted in \u00a32 million worth of damage in the City, 50 injuries and scores of arrests. Activists have dubbed this year's demonstration 'May Day Monopoly' after the property-buying board game. Last week organisers distributed a game guide on the internet, identifying targets on the famous Monopoly streets. Although none of these is in the City, police believe the demonstrators are unlikely to turn down the chance to hit at the heart of British capitalism. Senior officers in the Metropolitan Police, which has responsibility for the rest of London, have admitted they still do not know who is organising the demonstration, and no idea where they will strike. So far there have been no arrests in connection with May Day, despite last weekend's raid on a disused button factory which police claim was being used for 'training' up to 500 activists. Assistant Commissioner Mike Todd told The Observer: 'It is extremely difficult to prepare for this sort of event because of the complete unpredictability of those taking part. But we are treating it as a serious attempt to disable the City.' He said they had already identified 'symbolic targets' such as monuments, banks and large corporations. Police believe the ultimate prize for activists is the occupation of a government Ministry. The police believe the event will attract a hard core of activists still on the wanted list from last year's May Day demonstration, which brought chaos to Parliament Square, Whitehall and Trafalgar Square. Over the coming weeks they will make fresh appeals to the public to identify rioters from photos taken last year, and hope to seize the ringleaders when they arrive in London. There are already serious concerns that the City of London police are unprepared for a breakaway demonstration, although armed rapid response units have been put on standby. Police sources claim that special training days to teach officers riot control techniques have been poorly attended and officers above the rank of sergeant have had to be ordered to attend. At the apex of the City establishment, the Bank of England said it was still waiting for a firm line from the police. 'We are already on a high level of security already. After all, we've got billions of pounds of gold and banknotes in our vaults,' one senior Bank of England source said. 'After the last protest, we will be putting extra guards at the front and rear.' Other companies said that advice from the police had yet to come through. Anti-capitalists claim they have been subjected to a systematic police campaign of harassment and intimidation in the run-up to the demonstration. Police and media attention has focused on the surreal Wombles (White Overall Movement Building Libertarian Effective Struggle), a newly-formed direct action group who dress in white overalls, padded clothing and crash helmets to protect themselves from police batons and shields. Womble activists claim they have been filmed by police officers while handing out leaflets advertising the May Day Monopoly action, and attending organising meetings and benefit concerts. Two activists say they were stopped by Essex Police at Stansted airport after returning from a global action conference in Milan on 24 March. One said: 'It was supposedly a routine check, but I was held for 30 minutes and questioned about whether I was an organiser of the May Day Monopoly action.' The activist, who did not wish to be identified, said officers photocopied personal documents and lists of contacts. 'There's a war of attrition going on, even though we've done nothing illegal.' No more than 200 Wombles - named after the fictional TV creatures who pick up litter on Wimbledon Common - are expected to participate in the May Day demonstration. But the prospect of an organised core of demonstrators among a wider group of anti-capitalists has set alarm bells ringing at Scotland Yard. The idea to form the Wombles first germinated among a group of British anti-capitalists with links to the Reclaim The Streets movement, during last year's demonstration against the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in Prague.

      "body": "<p>In the hullaballoo following the American presidential election, with hanging and pregnant chads, and ballot forms that needed a PhD to decipher, it was easy to forget something that was in many ways even more alarming than confusion over who won. More than 90 million Americans had not bothered to vote - that is, more than the combined population of England, Ireland and Scandinavia.</p> <p>Low turnout is not just a US phenomenon. In the UK, the landslide victory for Labour in the election of 1997 was achieved on a turnout of 69 per cent - the lowest since the war. During the European elections in 1999, less than half of the electorate voted, and less than a quarter came out in the UK. In the Leeds Central by-election last year only 19 per cent of those eligible to vote did so. Predictions for the forthcoming general election are that turnout will fall to the lowest level yet.</p> <p>People have lost faith in politics, because they no longer know what governments are good for. Thanks to the steady withdrawal of the state over the past 20 years from the public sphere, it is corporations, not governments, that increasingly define the public realm.</p> <p>Unregulated or under-regulated by governments, corporations set the terms of engagement themselves. In the Third World we see a race to the bottom: multinationals pitting developing countries against each other to provide the most advantageous conditions for investment, with no regulation, no red tape, no unions, a blind eye turned to environmental degradation. It's good for profit, but bad for workers and local communities. As corporations go bottom fishing, host governments are left with little alternative but to accept the pickings. Globalisation may deliver liberty, but not fraternity or equality.</p> <p>At the headquarters of the World Trade Organisation on the banks of Lake Geneva we see rulings being made in the names of the free market that limit states' abilities to safeguard their people's interests. When the European Union tried to ban synthetic hormones from beef on the basis of strong evidence that they could cause cancer, reduce male fertility and in some cases result in the premature onset of puberty in young children, it found itself unable to do so thanks to a WTO ruling which put the interests of Monsanto, the US National Cattlemen's Association, the US Dairy Export Council and the National Milk Producers Federation first.</p> <p>Time and time again the WTO has intervened to prevent governments from using boycotts or tariffs against companies that they find to be acting in ethically or environmentally unacceptable ways.</p> <p>In Germany, where revenue from corporate taxes has fallen by 50 per cent over the past 20 years, despite a rise in corporate profits of 90 per cent, a group of companies, including Deutsche Bank, BMW, Daimler-Benz and RWE, the German energy and industrial group, thwarted in 1999 Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine's attempt to raise the tax burden on German firms, threatening to move investment or factories to other countries if government policy did not suit them. 'It's a question of at least 14,000 jobs,' threatened Dieter Schweer, a spokesman for RWE. 'If the investment position is no longer attractive, we will examine every possibility of switching our investments abroad.' Daimler-Benz proposed relocating to the US; other companies threatened to stop buying government bonds and investing in the German economy.</p> <p>In view of the power these corporations wield their threats were taken seriously. Within a few months Germany was planning corporate tax cuts which would reduce tax on German companies below US rates. As one of German Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der's senior advisers in Washington commented at the time, 'Deutsche Bank and industrial giants like Mercedes are too strong for the elected government in Berlin.'</p> <p>In the US, the quid pro quo being exacted by George W's corporate backers is becoming all too clear. Since being elected, the President has opened up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drillers, retreated from his promises of protecting forests, made moves to weaken the requirement on mining companies to clean after themselves and in recent weeks both reversed a campaign pledge to regulate CO 2 emissions from power plants and trashed the Kyoto treaty on global warming. The interests of the US people suborned to those of the major US energy giants that bank-rolled him: $47 million was all it cost.</p> <p>Here in the UK public services are increasingly being handed over to private corporations to manage and fund. The Government has already withdrawn from running the railways, soon it'll be withdrawing from air traffic control. Private health insurance is being pushed by the Conservatives as a way of staving off the collapse of our National Health Service. Even the education of our children, once the most sacred preserve of the state, is increasingly delegated to the private sector.</p> <p>Although it remains too early to see the consequences of the privatisation of public services played out in full, initial indications are troubling. The rail crashes, for which Gerald Corbett, when chief executive of Railtrack, put the blame on the way the railway 'was ripped apart at privatisation'; Angel School in Islington, a primary school now being run by the private company Cambridge Education Authorities, under threat of closure despite the fact that it has constantly improved its educational results, with the parents and staff left with no real means of redress or recourse; Nottingham University's acceptance of \u00a33.8m from British American Tobacco to set up, of all things, a school of corporate social responsibility; and the US model of healthcare proposed as a blueprint for our health reforms, despite the fact that 45 million Americans currently do not have health insurance and 25 per cent of the chronically ill there do not have adequate coverage.</p> <p>This is the world of the Silent Takeover, a world in which governments can no longer be relied on to protect the people's interests. Blinded by the allure of the market, they now put corporate interests first.</p> <p>So it is left to us, through individual action, to take the lead. In a world in which power increasingly lies in the hands of corporations rather than governments, the most effective way to be political is not to cast one's vote at the ballot box but to do so at the supermarket or at a shareholders' meeting.</p> <p>Because, when provoked, corporations respond. While governments dithered about the health value of GM foods, supermarkets faced with consumer unrest pulled the products off their shelves overnight. While nations spoke about ethical foreign policy, corporations pulled out of Burma rather than risk censure by customers. George W may have backed down on his campaign pledges to limit CO 2 emissions, but BP, a corporation, continues to spearhead their reduction. And when stories broke over the world of children sewing footballs for Reebok for a pittance, what did governments do? Nothing. But the corporation, fearing a consumer boycott, stepped in with innovative plans for dealing with the child labour problem.</p> <p>Delivering a quality product at a reasonable cost is not all that is now demanded of corporations. The key to consumer satisfaction is not only how well a company treats its customers, but increasingly whether it is perceived as taking its responsibilities to society seriously. People are demanding that corporations deliver in a way that governments can't or won't.</p> <p>It is not just the brown-rice-eating, sandal-wearing brigade who are making demands: 60 per cent of UK consumers are prepared to boycott stores or products because they are concerned about their ethical standards. Three-quarters of British consumers would choose a product on green or ethical issues. More than 75 per cent of Americans would boycott stores selling goods produced in sweatshops. Monsanto was brought to its knees by a coalition of eco-warriors and Britain's Women's Institute members. In America, the Interfaith Centre on Corporate Responsibility, with $110 billion at its disposal, is among the ethical investors now using shareholder power to 'regulate' corporate manoeuvres and get corporations to do good.</p> <p>Can we entrust the public interest to consumer and shareholder activists? Can shopping adequately replace voting? No, it cannot. The world cannot be simplified to the extent that consumer politics tends to demand. Is GM food necessarily always bad for consumers or the environment? Or could this technology be harnessed for good? Child labour may be distasteful to Western expectations, but does boycotting goods made with child labour improve or exacerbate the lot of Third World children?</p> <p>Trusting the market to regulate may not ultimately be in our interest. Moreover, populist politics can easily result in tyranny, not necessarily of the majority, but by those who can protest most effectively. Rather than empowering all, consumer and shareholder activism give greatest voice to those with the most money in their pockets, those with the greatest purchasing power, those who can switch from seller to seller with relative ease. Consumer and shareholder activism is a form of protest that favours the middle classes and the outpouring of dissatisfaction of the bourgeoisie.</p> <p>Nor should the takeover by corporations of governments' responsibilities be viewed as a reason for governments to withdraw. Despite the roles corporations are beginning to play in the social sphere, despite the fact that they may be able to play some role in alleviating poverty and inequity and protecting the environment, social investment and social justice will never become their core activity. Their contribution to society's needs will always remain at the margins. Corporate social responsibility cannot be thought of as a reasonable proxy for state responsibility.</p> <p>In Japan's Mitsubishi Villages, Nissan Towns, and Toyota Cities the Japanese keiratsus - trading companies - used to provide school vouchers, housing, and health care. In the wake of the Asian financial crisis, the firms are withdrawing support from the community. The head of Toshiba says that they are no longer 'a charity': entire communities are suffering. The suicide rate in Japan rose by a third between 1997 and 1999, a testament to the social strain.</p> <p>As more and more of the public realm is handed over to the private sector to manage, we need to see the Japanese case as a cautionary tale. If this move by Western corporations towards greater responsibility and care is predicated solely on the continuing strength of the global economy, on the fact that philanthropic acts are essentially tax write-offs against balance sheets firmly in the black, is it not likely to be reversed when times once again become difficult? Companies will simply not be able to justify staying involved to their shareholders, unless they calculate that withdrawal from their social commitments will be so damaging to their reputation as to be more costly than maintaining them. The corporate provision of welfare risks dependence on the continued generation of profits.</p> <p>We must also ask ourselves whether a price will be exacted for acts of corporate benevolence. Today Microsoft puts computers in our schools; will it tomorrow determine what our children learn? When Mike Cameron, a 19-year-old student, turned up at Greenbriar High School in Evans Georgia on official 'Coke Day' wearing a T-shirt with a Pepsi logo he was suspended. Channel One Network is now notorious for having provided 12,000 American schools with money and goods in exchange for beaming their commercials directly into the classroom. But do we want to live in a world in which commercialisation takes advantage of shortages in funding and rides on the back of children's' learning? This is not about ethics, this is about business. Sometimes the two will coincide, but clearly not always.</p> <p>Corporations are not society's custodians: they are commercial entities that act in the pursuit of profit, not ethical considerations. They are morally ambivalent. Often their business interests happen to coincide with society's, but this is by no means always the case. Governments on the other hand are supposed to respond to citizens. Downgrading the role of the state in favour of corporate activism threatens to make societal improvements dependent on the creation of profit. And governments that stand back while corporations take over, without being willing to set the terms of engagement or retain the upper hand, are in danger of losing the support of the people, whose feeling of lack of recourse or representation is showing itself in a wave of protest that goes beyond individual acts of consumer and shareholder dissent.</p> <p>Take the 40,000 Frenchmen who gathered outside the trial of French farmer Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9 or Granny D, the 91-year-old American great-grandmother who walked across America to protest against the relationship between big business and politics and was greeted by thousands upon her arrival at Washington DC or the Seattle Prague and May Day rioters that we saw on our television screens last year - all are examples of a global uprising of people who now see themselves as politically disposed.</p> <p>All over the world, people are beginning to lash out against corporations, governments and international organisations alike. In a world in which politicians now all sing from the same hymn sheet, people who want to change the hymn have to go outside the church.</p> <p>But like consumer and shareholder activism, other forms of protest should not be idealised. Their limitations are clear. The commonality of interests often centres on a shared general disillusionment, rather than specific concerns or proffered solutions. In some cases protesters are motivated by a sense of common good, but in others they are concerned only with safeguarding their own interests, or those of a limited group as in the British fuel protests of autumn 2000.</p> <p>Pressure groups need to play to the media, which encourages posturing, the demonisation of 'enemies', a massive oversimplification of issues and the choosing of fashionable rather than difficult causes to champion. Issues such as forest biodiversity, nitrate leaching or soil erosion in Africa hardly ever get a look in. And, as one of London's May Day protesters told me: 'There has to be trouble, otherwise the papers won't report it.'</p> <p>But despite the limitations of protest, despite its failure to balance effective means with democratic ends, despite the fact that it can never by itself be a long-term solution, the crucial question is whether protest can change politics in the same way as it is beginning to change the corporate agenda. Can protest put the people back into the forefront of politics?</p> <p>There are signs that perhaps it can, and that perhaps the political corpse is beginning to twitch. In June of 1999 in Cochabamba, Bolivia's third largest city, the water authority was privatised, following recommendations from the World Bank. At once the price of water tripled, which meant that a typical worker was spending almost a quarter of his or her monthly wage on water charges. People gathered on the streets and protested, there was a four-day general strike, bill payment was boycotted, and 30,000 people marched through the city centre in anger. Finally, in April 2000, the privatisation of the water supply was revoked. Back in 1985, government leaders had asked the Bolivian people for patience and sacrifice as it implemented neo-liberal reforms. Fifteen years later, it seemed that their patience had run out.</p> <p>In New Zealand, a country that embraced free market fundamentalism with enthusiasm in the early 1980s, the new Labour administration is implementing changes that for the past 20 years would have been considered heretical. Workplace accident insurance has been renationalised, a state-run People's Bank will open soon in which personal banking fees will be 20 to 30 per cent lower than those charged by private banks, tax cuts for high earners have been reversed and trade union rights boosted. As Prime Minister Helen Clark has said, New Zealand's experiment in market fundamentalism has failed.</p> <p>In the US we are also seeing the beginnings of a turnaround. Prompted by the complete failure of California's privately owned power distributors to deliver electricity at a fair price to citizens, or often to deliver it at all, and experiencing their first state-wide blackouts since the Second World War, Californian politicians are contemplating a once unthinkable change of course: to regain control of the very transmission system that the state privatised five years ago. Even Ronald Reaganland is breaking with its past.</p> <p>Small signs, it is true, and for now focused on renationalisation rather than issues of global concern, but they represent cracks in an ideology that had become hegemonic over the past 20 years, the beginnings of a recognition that there has to be new thinking.</p> <p>But while in faraway lands the unthinkable is being thought, here at home do we have any signs that politicians are questioning their certainty that the private sector will be our salvation? Any willingness to admit the dangers of this silent takeover, this world in which corporations not governments are increasingly making the rules? No.</p> <p>Looking at the choices on offer at the forthcoming election, we see all too clearly the extent of the political consensus. A reduced state, with an ever greater dependence on corporations for solutions, has become the standard line touted by all parties.</p> <p>As far back as 1968, Margaret Thatcher said in a famous speech: 'There are dangers in consensus: it could be an attempt to satisfy people holding no particular views about anything. No great party can survive except on the basis of firm beliefs about what it wants to do.' The irony is that by buying so wholeheartedly into the form of capitalism initiated by Thatcher and Reagan, British politics has fallen into this very trap, leaving us the electorate increasingly alienated from and distrustful of politics, and providing us with little alternative but to protest rather than vote. Until the Government regains the trust of the electorate, the people will continue to scorn democracy. Until the state reclaims the people, the people will not reclaim the state.</p> <p>\u0095 <b> Noreena Hertz</b> is the Associate Director of the Centre for International Business and Management at the Judge Institute of Management Studies, University of Cambridge.

'If the investment position is no longer attractive, we will examine every possibility of switching our investments abroad.' Daimler-Benz proposed relocating to the US; other companies threatened to stop buying government bonds and investing in the German economy. In view of the power these corporations wield their threats were taken seriously. Within a few months Germany was planning corporate tax cuts which would reduce tax on German companies below US rates. As one of German Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der's senior advisers in Washington commented at the time, 'Deutsche Bank and industrial giants like Mercedes are too strong for the elected government in Berlin.' In the US, the quid pro quo being exacted by George W's corporate backers is becoming all too clear. Since being elected, the President has opened up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drillers, retreated from his promises of protecting forests, made moves to weaken the requirement on mining companies to clean after themselves and in recent weeks both reversed a campaign pledge to regulate CO 2 emissions from power plants and trashed the Kyoto treaty on global warming. The interests of the US people suborned to those of the major US energy giants that bank-rolled him: $47 million was all it cost. Here in the UK public services are increasingly being handed over to private corporations to manage and fund. The Government has already withdrawn from running the railways, soon it'll be withdrawing from air traffic control. Private health insurance is being pushed by the Conservatives as a way of staving off the collapse of our National Health Service. Even the education of our children, once the most sacred preserve of the state, is increasingly delegated to the private sector. Although it remains too early to see the consequences of the privatisation of public services played out in full, initial indications are troubling. The rail crashes, for which Gerald Corbett, when chief executive of Railtrack, put the blame on the way the railway 'was ripped apart at privatisation'; Angel School in Islington, a primary school now being run by the private company Cambridge Education Authorities, under threat of closure despite the fact that it has constantly improved its educational results, with the parents and staff left with no real means of redress or recourse; Nottingham University's acceptance of \u00a33.8m from British American Tobacco to set up, of all things, a school of corporate social responsibility; and the US model of healthcare proposed as a blueprint for our health reforms, despite the fact that 45 million Americans currently do not have health insurance and 25 per cent of the chronically ill there do not have adequate coverage. This is the world of the Silent Takeover, a world in which governments can no longer be relied on to protect the people's interests. Blinded by the allure of the market, they now put corporate interests first. So it is left to us, through individual action, to take the lead. In a world in which power increasingly lies in the hands of corporations rather than governments, the most effective way to be political is not to cast one's vote at the ballot box but to do so at the supermarket or at a shareholders' meeting. Because, when provoked, corporations respond. While governments dithered about the health value of GM foods, supermarkets faced with consumer unrest pulled the products off their shelves overnight. While nations spoke about ethical foreign policy, corporations pulled out of Burma rather than risk censure by customers. George W may have backed down on his campaign pledges to limit CO 2 emissions, but BP, a corporation, continues to spearhead their reduction. And when stories broke over the world of children sewing footballs for Reebok for a pittance, what did governments do? Nothing. But the corporation, fearing a consumer boycott, stepped in with innovative plans for dealing with the child labour problem. Delivering a quality product at a reasonable cost is not all that is now demanded of corporations. The key to consumer satisfaction is not only how well a company treats its customers, but increasingly whether it is perceived as taking its responsibilities to society seriously. People are demanding that corporations deliver in a way that governments can't or won't. It is not just the brown-rice-eating, sandal-wearing brigade who are making demands: 60 per cent of UK consumers are prepared to boycott stores or products because they are concerned about their ethical standards. Three-quarters of British consumers would choose a product on green or ethical issues. More than 75 per cent of Americans would boycott stores selling goods produced in sweatshops. Monsanto was brought to its knees by a coalition of eco-warriors and Britain's Women's Institute members. In America, the Interfaith Centre on Corporate Responsibility, with $110 billion at its disposal, is among the ethical investors now using shareholder power to 'regulate' corporate manoeuvres and get corporations to do good. Can we entrust the public interest to consumer and shareholder activists? Can shopping adequately replace voting? No, it cannot. The world cannot be simplified to the extent that consumer politics tends to demand. Is GM food necessarily always bad for consumers or the environment? Or could this technology be harnessed for good? Child labour may be distasteful to Western expectations, but does boycotting goods made with child labour improve or exacerbate the lot of Third World children? Trusting the market to regulate may not ultimately be in our interest. Moreover, populist politics can easily result in tyranny, not necessarily of the majority, but by those who can protest most effectively. Rather than empowering all, consumer and shareholder activism give greatest voice to those with the most money in their pockets, those with the greatest purchasing power, those who can switch from seller to seller with relative ease. Consumer and shareholder activism is a form of protest that favours the middle classes and the outpouring of dissatisfaction of the bourgeoisie. Nor should the takeover by corporations of governments' responsibilities be viewed as a reason for governments to withdraw. Despite the roles corporations are beginning to play in the social sphere, despite the fact that they may be able to play some role in alleviating poverty and inequity and protecting the environment, social investment and social justice will never become their core activity. Their contribution to society's needs will always remain at the margins. Corporate social responsibility cannot be thought of as a reasonable proxy for state responsibility. In Japan's Mitsubishi Villages, Nissan Towns, and Toyota Cities the Japanese keiratsus - trading companies - used to provide school vouchers, housing, and health care. In the wake of the Asian financial crisis, the firms are withdrawing support from the community. The head of Toshiba says that they are no longer 'a charity': entire communities are suffering. The suicide rate in Japan rose by a third between 1997 and 1999, a testament to the social strain. As more and more of the public realm is handed over to the private sector to manage, we need to see the Japanese case as a cautionary tale. If this move by Western corporations towards greater responsibility and care is predicated solely on the continuing strength of the global economy, on the fact that philanthropic acts are essentially tax write-offs against balance sheets firmly in the black, is it not likely to be reversed when times once again become difficult? Companies will simply not be able to justify staying involved to their shareholders, unless they calculate that withdrawal from their social commitments will be so damaging to their reputation as to be more costly than maintaining them. The corporate provision of welfare risks dependence on the continued generation of profits. We must also ask ourselves whether a price will be exacted for acts of corporate benevolence. Today Microsoft puts computers in our schools; will it tomorrow determine what our children learn? When Mike Cameron, a 19-year-old student, turned up at Greenbriar High School in Evans Georgia on official 'Coke Day' wearing a T-shirt with a Pepsi logo he was suspended. Channel One Network is now notorious for having provided 12,000 American schools with money and goods in exchange for beaming their commercials directly into the classroom. But do we want to live in a world in which commercialisation takes advantage of shortages in funding and rides on the back of children's' learning? This is not about ethics, this is about business. Sometimes the two will coincide, but clearly not always. Corporations are not society's custodians: they are commercial entities that act in the pursuit of profit, not ethical considerations. They are morally ambivalent. Often their business interests happen to coincide with society's, but this is by no means always the case. Governments on the other hand are supposed to respond to citizens. Downgrading the role of the state in favour of corporate activism threatens to make societal improvements dependent on the creation of profit. And governments that stand back while corporations take over, without being willing to set the terms of engagement or retain the upper hand, are in danger of losing the support of the people, whose feeling of lack of recourse or representation is showing itself in a wave of protest that goes beyond individual acts of consumer and shareholder dissent. Take the 40,000 Frenchmen who gathered outside the trial of French farmer Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9 or Granny D, the 91-year-old American great-grandmother who walked across America to protest against the relationship between big business and politics and was greeted by thousands upon her arrival at Washington DC or the Seattle Prague and May Day rioters that we saw on our television screens last year - all are examples of a global uprising of people who now see themselves as politically disposed. All over the world, people are beginning to lash out against corporations, governments and international organisations alike. In a world in which politicians now all sing from the same hymn sheet, people who want to change the hymn have to go outside the church. But like consumer and shareholder activism, other forms of protest should not be idealised. Their limitations are clear. The commonality of interests often centres on a shared general disillusionment, rather than specific concerns or proffered solutions. In some cases protesters are motivated by a sense of common good, but in others they are concerned only with safeguarding their own interests, or those of a limited group as in the British fuel protests of autumn 2000. Pressure groups need to play to the media, which encourages posturing, the demonisation of 'enemies', a massive oversimplification of issues and the choosing of fashionable rather than difficult causes to champion. Issues such as forest biodiversity, nitrate leaching or soil erosion in Africa hardly ever get a look in. And, as one of London's May Day protesters told me: 'There has to be trouble, otherwise the papers won't report it.' But despite the limitations of protest, despite its failure to balance effective means with democratic ends, despite the fact that it can never by itself be a long-term solution, the crucial question is whether protest can change politics in the same way as it is beginning to change the corporate agenda. Can protest put the people back into the forefront of politics? There are signs that perhaps it can, and that perhaps the political corpse is beginning to twitch. In June of 1999 in Cochabamba, Bolivia's third largest city, the water authority was privatised, following recommendations from the World Bank. At once the price of water tripled, which meant that a typical worker was spending almost a quarter of his or her monthly wage on water charges. People gathered on the streets and protested, there was a four-day general strike, bill payment was boycotted, and 30,000 people marched through the city centre in anger. Finally, in April 2000, the privatisation of the water supply was revoked. Back in 1985, government leaders had asked the Bolivian people for patience and sacrifice as it implemented neo-liberal reforms. Fifteen years later, it seemed that their patience had run out. In New Zealand, a country that embraced free market fundamentalism with enthusiasm in the early 1980s, the new Labour administration is implementing changes that for the past 20 years would have been considered heretical. Workplace accident insurance has been renationalised, a state-run People's Bank will open soon in which personal banking fees will be 20 to 30 per cent lower than those charged by private banks, tax cuts for high earners have been reversed and trade union rights boosted. As Prime Minister Helen Clark has said, New Zealand's experiment in market fundamentalism has failed. In the US we are also seeing the beginnings of a turnaround. Prompted by the complete failure of California's privately owned power distributors to deliver electricity at a fair price to citizens, or often to deliver it at all, and experiencing their first state-wide blackouts since the Second World War, Californian politicians are contemplating a once unthinkable change of course: to regain control of the very transmission system that the state privatised five years ago. Even Ronald Reaganland is breaking with its past. Small signs, it is true, and for now focused on renationalisation rather than issues of global concern, but they represent cracks in an ideology that had become hegemonic over the past 20 years, the beginnings of a recognition that there has to be new thinking. But while in faraway lands the unthinkable is being thought, here at home do we have any signs that politicians are questioning their certainty that the private sector will be our salvation? Any willingness to admit the dangers of this silent takeover, this world in which corporations not governments are increasingly making the rules? No. Looking at the choices on offer at the forthcoming election, we see all too clearly the extent of the political consensus. A reduced state, with an ever greater dependence on corporations for solutions, has become the standard line touted by all parties. As far back as 1968, Margaret Thatcher said in a famous speech: 'There are dangers in consensus: it could be an attempt to satisfy people holding no particular views about anything. No great party can survive except on the basis of firm beliefs about what it wants to do.' The irony is that by buying so wholeheartedly into the form of capitalism initiated by Thatcher and Reagan, British politics has fallen into this very trap, leaving us the electorate increasingly alienated from and distrustful of politics, and providing us with little alternative but to protest rather than vote. Until the Government regains the trust of the electorate, the people will continue to scorn democracy. Until the state reclaims the people, the people will not reclaim the state. \u0095 Noreena Hertz is the Associate Director of the Centre for International Business and Management at the Judge Institute of Management Studies, University of Cambridge.

      "bodyText": "A government agency is investigating the first 'Category 1' water pollution incident connected to the foot-and-mouth crisis. Hundreds of fish have been killed in a fresh water course in Anglesey after disinfectant used during a cull of cattle leaked into a spring. The incident is the first evidence of the serious environmental damage experts believe the mass cull of cattle and sheep may create if it is not handled more carefully. An Environment Agency spokesman said that restrictions on movement around the country were hampering its investigations into the incident in which hundreds of trout and eel died. He said that there had also been a number of more minor pollution breaches which had been caused by blood and animal waste leaking into rivers. The Government was facing more criticism last night over the plans to bury tens of thousands of sheep and cattle after it was revealed that a similar policy in America had led to an environmental disaster. Up to a million chickens, pigs and cattle were buried in pits in North Carolina after Hurricane Floyd wreaked havoc in 1999. The policy has led to contamination of thousands of wells which the state relies on for its water supply. Levels of illnesses in the local population have also soared. 'If you do it wrong now you will be living with the consequences for the next 15 years,' said Elliott Moorhead, the chief executive of NanoVapor and one of America's leading experts in animal waste disposal. 'What you are basically building is a pit where diseases can breed. It is a potential disaster.' News of the pollution outbreak will damage the Prime Minister's attempts to re-invigorate Britain's tourism industry which has been hit hard by the foot-and-mouth crisis. A Downing Street official admitted that pictures of dead fish floating in rivers was not 'the kind of imagery that will sell well abroad'. Tony Blair is getting increasingly frustrated at the lack of action on opening up the countryside. County councils across the country said yesterday that they would refuse to open up footpaths and access to the countryside despite orders from Downing Street. 'There is no evidence that any case of infection has been caused by walkers, by visitors, or by people not in contact with livestock,' the Environment Minister, Beverley Grant, said yesterday. 'This means that local authorities and others ought to be basing their assessment of how far they can open up the countryside on that scientific evidence.' The first evidence that the burial programme was facing serious environmental problems came last week when Maff admitted that it would have to dig up the carcasses of almost 900 sheep and cattle because they had been disposed of in the wrong site. The carcasses had been buried a few metres away from a fresh water spring at Tow Law, Co Durham, despite orders from the Environment Agency that the area should not be used. Meanwhile, Agriculture Minister Nick Brown played down the role that a Chinese restaurant may have played in the foot-and-mouth outbreak. His department had previously highlighted illegal imports of meat from China as the most probably source of the disease, the reporting of which resulted in a 40 per cent fall in the takings of Chinese restaurants, many of which received racist phonecalls. However, in a meeting with delegates of the Chinese Civil Rights Action Group he said there was currently no evidence linking the outbreak with imported Chinese meat. In an official statement, he failed to rule out a Chinese restaurant as a possible source, but said: 'It would be totally unfair to make a scapegoat of the Chinese community or Chinese restaurants. The investigations into the source of the outbreak are still continuing, and ill-informed, groundless speculation does nothing to help the situation.
