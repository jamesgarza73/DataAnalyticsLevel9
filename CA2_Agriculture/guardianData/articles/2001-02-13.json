The resignation of their chairman Howard Culley followed. </p> <p>Jewell has been replaced by his highly experienced assistant Peter Shreeves, who will be in charge in a caretaker capacity for tonight's game with their fellow strugglers Tranmere at Hillsborough. </p> <p>Although Shreeves would undoubtedly welcome the chance to return to permanent front-line management, Wednesday will probably seek to install someone with a reputation for turning around seemingly lost causes. </p> <p>Two former managers of their bitter rivals Sheffield United - Dave Bassett and Howard Kendall - may feature on the directors' wish-list.

      "bodyText": "Sheffield Wednesday, bottom of the First Division, yesterday tried a last desperate throw of the dice when they sacked their manager Paul Jewell. The resignation of their chairman Howard Culley followed. Jewell has been replaced by his highly experienced assistant Peter Shreeves, who will be in charge in a caretaker capacity for tonight's game with their fellow strugglers Tranmere at Hillsborough. Although Shreeves would undoubtedly welcome the chance to return to permanent front-line management, Wednesday will probably seek to install someone with a reputation for turning around seemingly lost causes. Two former managers of their bitter rivals Sheffield United - Dave Bassett and Howard Kendall - may feature on the directors' wish-list. Bassett, football's most celebrated firefighter, is unemployed after recently resigning his post at Barnsley, and Kendall has been out of management for more than two years. Jewell departed pointing an accusing finger at those who guard the Wednesday purse-strings. \"I'm disappointed because, in all honesty, I didn't see this coming,\" he said. \"I was preparing for the home game with Tranmere and working on bringing in a loan player from Southampton, Trond Egil Soltvedt.\" The Norwegian became Peter Shreeves' first signing yesterday on a month's loan. \"Look at the players I was forced to sell last summer,\" Jewell went on. \"In contrast I have barely been given a penny to spend; I have had to rely on kids. \"But I do not regret coming here because I have learned much over the past seven months or so.

The final straw for Jewell and Culley came on Saturday when the team were humbled 4-1 away by Wimbledon. Yesterday's developments came 72 hours after Culley had indicated his determination to extend a tenure which began less than 12 months ago after his predecessor Dave Richards took up the post of chairman of the Premier League.

Cartier-Bresson has objected to a book of photographs of him by the American David Douglas Duncan, entitled Faceless. They are mediocre, \"snapshots\" rather than true portraits, he protests. But it can't be just the quality of the pictures that has upset him. Duncan too is a famous photographer, whose images of the Korean war are classics. He was able to photograph Cartier-Bresson casually, over drinks at the Musee Picasso in Paris, because Cartier-Bres son was on assignment to photograph him. The fact is, the world's most revered photographer hates having his picture taken.</p> <p>He's not alone. Who doesn't have a fear of the camera's power to tell us what we are? From posing for our first school photo, we learn the oppressiveness of the camera, its power to define us. Think of poor Marilyn Monroe, going through the contact sheets of her photo sessions, crossing out shots she didn't like. Artists, who understand the authority of visual experience, are not less but more mystical about the power of the image.</p> <p>Cartier-Bresson at least allows some images of himself to circulate. Stanley Kubrick, who began as a photojournalist, be came such a stranger to snappers that an impersonator was able to pass himself off as the director despite looking nothing like him. And who can say what part was played in the disintegration of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman's marriage by their decision to play a married couple to Kubrick's searching camera in Eyes Wide Shut? The camera seemed to capture a lack of physical passion in their scenes together, and a falseness in the marriage that has now collapsed.</p> <p>Yet Kubrick did allow one person to portray him - his wife. Christiane Kubrick, an artist, painted Kubrick and showed his portrait in exhibitions in St Albans. Kubrick clearly only trusted images that were made with love. The same is true of Cartier-Bresson. He is happy with the photographs taken of him by his wife, Martine Franck. Similarly, it's hard to imagine the American painter Georgia O'Keeffe posing semi-nude in a series of portraits had the photographer, Alfred Stieglitz, not also been her lover.</p> <p>Other artists have had a more troubled relationship with the one-eyed intruder. Jackson Pollock's fame was established by Arnold Newman and Hans Namuth's photos of him brooding in front of his canvases or throwing paint. But when Namuth persuaded him also to be filmed at work, Pollock felt exposed. He ended the session by falling spectacularly off the wagon (he'd been dry for a few highly productive years), turning over the dinner table and shouting: \"I'm not the phony, you're the phony.\"</p> <p>Artists seem to divide, just like the rest of us, into clumsy introverts, terrified of the camera, and people who love - and are loved by - the lens. I doubt whether Salvador Dali ever objected to having his picture taken. He even let Helmut Newton photograph him with a tube in his nose in his last days, a miserable figure of futile wealth and sterile fame. Picasso was a happy subject and adept media performer: Cartier-Bresson caught him in a fearful moment in wartime, Duncan shot the artist in the bath. But other kinds of portrayal caused Picasso pain he was horrified when Francoise Gilot published an account of their relationship. Images didn't bother him words did.</p> <p>Duncan points out in his defence of Cartier-Bresson that he is celebrated for snatching \"the decisive moment\", photographing people unawares. But I don't think that's adequate. Cartier-Bresson is not a pitiless snapper. If he has a personal fear of the lens, he has tried to soften its assault on others. His pictures of artists in particular - Matisse, Bonnard, Picasso - are richly artful celebrations \"portraits\", he would say, rather than \"snapshots\".</p> <p>His portrait of Matisse, taken in 1944, catches the artist sketching in a room full of pet birds, one of which he holds Matisse has been photographed spontaneously, yet the image Cartier-Bresson has selected from the many he took that day is an allegory of Matisse as creator, his imagination soaring. None of the birds is in a cage.</p> <p>Cartier-Bresson complains that, rather than choose one significant portrait, Duncan has published an entire reel of film.

According to Lembit \u00d6pik, Lib Dem MP for Montgomeryshire, one urgent need for more support is the threat of cosmic disaster. \"It will happen, we just do not know when,\" he said. \"It could be before I finish speaking - in which case I apologise for the fact that my words will be the last thing that honorable Members hear - or it could be in 50m years. My guess is that it will be somewhere between those two.\" Evidence suggests, he said, that the last fatalities from cosmic impact in the UK took place in 1783 - when16 people were killed by an unusual object from space. Dinosaurs, meanwhile, were wiped out 65m years ago. \"We know that species will be wiped out again in the near future - unless we take action to prevent it.\" Research news Forward march A commission on the future of social sciences has been established by the recently formed Academy of Learned Societies for the Social Sciences. Spacy, man Women are less likely than men to be eligible to apply for research grants provided by the Wellcome Trust and all government research councils -except for the Economic and Social Research Council - according to a long-awaited report. But it said when women did apply for grants they were as successful as male colleagues. Universe Africa cashes in The Association of African Universities, which has more than 170 member institutions from 43 countries, has signalled support for charging tuition fees. The four-yearly meeting in Nairobi heard that institutions like Uganda's Makerere University had been able to raise staff salaries and revamp programmes after introducing fees. Universities on the continent face dire financial problems, aggravated by the spread of Aids, and many believe that free higher education cannot be sustained.",

It is also quite possible that some graduates don't realise they are affected, as symptoms are not always as obvious as feeling miserable all the time.

Nicola, 23, went straight to university from sixth-form college, then finished her English degree not knowing what she wanted to do with her life. She went to her parents' house for the summer, then picked up part-time work but wasn't happy. She became apathetic, couldn't get out of bed, lost her appetite and all her confidence: \"The minute I was on my own I'd burst into tears. It didn't hit me until March that I was horrendously depressed,\" Nicola says. </p> <p>It isn't just those graduates taking their first steps into the adult world who lose their footing. Melanie was 30 when she began her degree, after raising two children. She excelled at university and enjoyed her new identity. When she came out with a first she felt invincible. \"I thought, 'I'm going to conquer the world' - that this was the start of something fantastic.\" </p> <p>Her PhD proposal was accepted but she couldn't get funding, so, taking time off to look after her kids, she began to feel that she was back where she started. Lots of her friends, other mature students, also went back to doing the same thing they were doing before their degree, \"not because they wanted to, but that was just the easiest thing to do\". She had succumbed to the luxury of learning, and she and her friends all wanted to go back to it, to the active mind-set of constant discussion and discovery. </p> <p>\"When you're at university, you do a piece of work, hand it in, get a response,\" she says. \"There's no other environment where you get that, that kind of validation all the time, those rewards.\" When she left she realised she didn't feel equipped to actually do anything. Nicola agrees: \"It's all 'transferable skills', but you don't have any idea where to transfer them to!\" </p> <p>\"I think those people who got themselves work before they left [university] were much better off,\" says Melanie. \"You can go straight into work, you don't have that loss.\" </p> <p>According to a 1998/99 census, 68.5% of students were employed six months after finishing their first degree. But the figures, collated by the Higher Education Statistics Agency, include part-time and voluntary work and make no distinction between career choices and stopgap jobs.

In the corporate world, no one cares about you.\" </p> <p>After being encouraged to think independently at university, to compare ideologies, to criticise her own and other people's judgement, she found herself put into place as a cog of capitalism, working to make money for someone else and never being asked to engage her brain. </p> <p>Mike Burton, a psychiatrist, sees this post-university period as just one of many major life events that can bring about unease and anxiety. \"We're just not very well designed for large changes,\" Burton says. As post-university may be a time when many transitions happen at once, while also losing a support system of friends and tutors, it is unsurprising that this is a prime period for self-doubt. </p> <p>\"Vulnerable students are likely to be those who have unrealistic goals with little or no back-up,\" he says. Burton points to another contributing factor: the transition from the structured rituals of academic life to the relatively formless ordinary world of earning a living. </p> <p>Surely this need not be an inevitable stumbling block? With so many students facing difficulties, is there anything being done to make the transition more seamless?

      "body": "<p>Like most academics, Abdul Lalzad talks eagerly about his research. He is working on a way of using solar power to desalinate water cheaply - potentially a vast boon to his native Afghanistan and a swathe of countries across Asia, the Middle East and Africa which suffer from water shortages but no lack of sunshine. </p> <p>But as he talks at his bench at South Bank University in London his eyes betray deep anxiety and sadness. There is sadness for the wreck of his country under a regime which has driven him out and destroyed the university he was proud of. But uppermost in his mind is whether his wife and their five children will be allowed to join him after more than two years apart. They were being interviewed in Pakistan that day by the British High Commission about a visa. \"My mind is not here,\" he apologises. </p> <p>The professor of engineering from Kabul is one of 27 people now being helped by the Council for Assisting Refugee Academics (Cara), a body which started in 1933 to help Jews and other victims of the Nazi purge of universities. The formation of what was then called the Academic Assistance Council was kick-started by a tumultuous meeting at the Albert Hall addressed by Albert Einstein. Today the centres of persecution have shifted via South Africa and Latin America to Iraq, Sudan, Ethiopia, Rwanda and Somalia, but the job of helping university teachers and researchers to pick themselves up after persecution and establish themselves in this country remains the same. </p> <p>The climate of hatred and distrust of asylum seekers is perhaps even worse than in the 1930s, although over the years Britain's reward for sheltering scholars has been out of all proportion to the tiny investment - 18 Nobel prizewinners, 71 fellows of the Royal Society, 50 fellows of the British Academy. </p> <p>The council campaigns on refugee issues and criticises what it sees as the worst excesses of government policy, such as the demeaning vouchers system. Its president, Sir Raymond Hoffenberg, who himself was a political exile from South Africa, has attacked the \"wholly unacceptable\" Immigration and Asylum Act and the current wave of bigotry at a time of unprecedented prosperity: \"It is difficult to imagine the implications for the UK and the world had Karl Popper or Max Perutz - two of the scholars we supported - been dealt with in the demeaning way envisaged by the current legislation: in isolation from other scholars, dumped far from cen tres of learning and forced to live on benefits provided by vouchers.\" </p> <p>But most of the council's work is practical: advice about the labyrinthine asylum and social security regulations, making contact with university departments where they might be welcome, small grants for fees and travel. Cara limits its scope to helping genuine academics but even for this small section of the overall refugee population it could do a lot more if it had more funds. </p> <p>Professor Lalzad's case is typical. A specialist in thermal engineering with a Russian masters degree, he taught in the department of mechanical engineering at Kabul University. He had five textbooks and more than 30 published articles to his credit and had held senior university positions. When the victorious Taliban closed the university, he worked for the Red Cross, in charge of distributing thousands of tonnes of food to 40,000 widows and disabled people. </p> <p>He was arrested, beaten with Kalashnikovs and thrown in prison on suspicion of giving information to anti-Taliban forces. The influence of the Red Cross got him released, but his life was in danger and he fled to Pakistan, where his wife and children were eventually able to follow. </p> <p>He arrived at Heathrow in December 1998, to be grilled for hours by immigration officials who believed he was Pakistani because his English was so good. (It was the medium of instruction in his department.) Lalzad concedes that Pakistanis do try to enter the UK by claiming to be Afghan refugees, and is sure he would have been deported had he not produced his Red Cross identity card. </p> <p>Then came a frustrating wait while his application for asylum was considered (it took 18 months) and he tried to get work. \"I felt ashamed sitting at home. It is a morally bad way of living for someone with education and knowledge not to work.\" Letters to universities produced no result, though he was encouraged by a short course at the University of North London, where he made contacts. He was at last given a break at South Bank by the director of engineering research, Professor Tassos Karayiannis. </p> <p>A grant from Cara is paying bench fees and for the purchase of a computer as Lalzad pursues a part-time PhD on his desalination research. At the moment he is doing mathematical modelling with the aim of building an experimental model of a solar-powered desalination plant. </p> <p>Desalination technology is well advanced in the oil-rich Middle East states, but across a wide zone of northern Asia, the Middle East and North Africa there is a pressing need for small, cheap plants. The goal is a gadget consisting of a small box and a condenser. \"I hope it will be a very low cost and efficient technique for desalinating water that can be used in poor developing countries, especially where they have a lot of solar energy.\" </p> <p>He hopes to be able to resume teaching at his new university. Meanwhile he waits for news of his family. </p> <p>The potential benefits of Professor Lalzad's research are obvious. John Akker, secretary of Cara, says his case is repeated many times over among the academics on their books. </p> <p>There is the Iraqi paediatrician, a consultant at Salahaddin University, forced to leave because of the help he gave to the Kurdish population. He has been given small grants for books and fees to enable him to pass the level of English that would allow him to practise in this country. Another Iraqi doctor is currently doing medical research at Manchester, while a bacteriologist identified only as Ms L is doing a PhD at Brighton University. </p> <p>Also receiving grants from the council are academics from Ethiopia, Somalia, Sudan, Rwanda and Sierra Leon, and a Chinese economist who suffered long-running harassment and was dismissed from his university post after taking part in the Tiananmen Square demonstrations. He is now doing an English course to enable him to pursue a masters. Until the council paid for travel expenses (\u00a3697 last year) he was walking ten miles to college. Yet he has not left all harassment behind: now it's racial. </p> <p>Akker is angered by current hysteria against asylum seekers, and worried by Home Secretary Jack Straw's proposals to process applications in neighbouring countries: \"These people are seen as scroungers living off the state, but they want to contribute here actively, and want to go back to their countries to change the things that brought them here in the first place.\" </p> <p><strong>Cara: giving hope when hope has fled</strong></p> <p>Albie Sachs, an academic who became a judge in South Africa's constitutional court, was twice helped by Cara's predecessor body, the Society for the Protection of Science and Learning - once when he fled the apartheid regime in 1966 and then again when he was nearly killed by a bomb in Mozambique. </p> <p>In a lecture he expressed his warm feelings for the body and its quiet unobtrusive work. \"It is not one of those bodies which takes out adverts in the bottom right hand of the front page of the Guardian,\" he told his audience in London in 1997. </p> <p>\"It was people helping people in need simply because they were in trouble, because they got into trouble because they were trying to do research in an intolerant society where persecution became the name of the game.\" </p> <p>This altruism did have enormous benefits to Britain in the contributions these outsiders made in teaching and research, and the effects did not stop there, he said. \"When the causes of persecution have been removed and we go back to our countries, we take so much of Britain with us. The positive and negative lessons which we learnt here. The things to avoid, the mistakes that are made, the good things that are done, and we help to rebuild our own countries and to develop democracy, science and learning and culture.\" </p> <p>Sachs listed a series of ministers in the first post-apartheid government in South Africa who had spent time in Britain, from Thabo Mbeki, Nelson Mandela's successor, who has an MA in economics from Sussex, to finance minister Gill Marcus, who set up a sandwich kiosk in Holborn, London, while in exile, and Frene Ginwala, speaker of the South African parliament. </p> <p>There might be spin-offs for Britain, he added, \"but what really matters is that some things are good in themselves, they do not need extra justification.\" </p> <p>The council is launching an appeal this spring.

It is a morally bad way of living for someone with education and knowledge not to work.\" Letters to universities produced no result, though he was encouraged by a short course at the University of North London, where he made contacts. He was at last given a break at South Bank by the director of engineering research, Professor Tassos Karayiannis. A grant from Cara is paying bench fees and for the purchase of a computer as Lalzad pursues a part-time PhD on his desalination research. At the moment he is doing mathematical modelling with the aim of building an experimental model of a solar-powered desalination plant. Desalination technology is well advanced in the oil-rich Middle East states, but across a wide zone of northern Asia, the Middle East and North Africa there is a pressing need for small, cheap plants. The goal is a gadget consisting of a small box and a condenser. \"I hope it will be a very low cost and efficient technique for desalinating water that can be used in poor developing countries, especially where they have a lot of solar energy.\" He hopes to be able to resume teaching at his new university. Meanwhile he waits for news of his family. The potential benefits of Professor Lalzad's research are obvious. John Akker, secretary of Cara, says his case is repeated many times over among the academics on their books. There is the Iraqi paediatrician, a consultant at Salahaddin University, forced to leave because of the help he gave to the Kurdish population. He has been given small grants for books and fees to enable him to pass the level of English that would allow him to practise in this country. Another Iraqi doctor is currently doing medical research at Manchester, while a bacteriologist identified only as Ms L is doing a PhD at Brighton University. Also receiving grants from the council are academics from Ethiopia, Somalia, Sudan, Rwanda and Sierra Leon, and a Chinese economist who suffered long-running harassment and was dismissed from his university post after taking part in the Tiananmen Square demonstrations. He is now doing an English course to enable him to pursue a masters. Until the council paid for travel expenses (\u00a3697 last year) he was walking ten miles to college. Yet he has not left all harassment behind: now it's racial. Akker is angered by current hysteria against asylum seekers, and worried by Home Secretary Jack Straw's proposals to process applications in neighbouring countries: \"These people are seen as scroungers living off the state, but they want to contribute here actively, and want to go back to their countries to change the things that brought them here in the first place.\" Cara: giving hope when hope has fled Albie Sachs, an academic who became a judge in South Africa's constitutional court, was twice helped by Cara's predecessor body, the Society for the Protection of Science and Learning - once when he fled the apartheid regime in 1966 and then again when he was nearly killed by a bomb in Mozambique. In a lecture he expressed his warm feelings for the body and its quiet unobtrusive work. \"It is not one of those bodies which takes out adverts in the bottom right hand of the front page of the Guardian,\" he told his audience in London in 1997. \"It was people helping people in need simply because they were in trouble, because they got into trouble because they were trying to do research in an intolerant society where persecution became the name of the game.\" This altruism did have enormous benefits to Britain in the contributions these outsiders made in teaching and research, and the effects did not stop there, he said. \"When the causes of persecution have been removed and we go back to our countries, we take so much of Britain with us. The positive and negative lessons which we learnt here. The things to avoid, the mistakes that are made, the good things that are done, and we help to rebuild our own countries and to develop democracy, science and learning and culture.\" Sachs listed a series of ministers in the first post-apartheid government in South Africa who had spent time in Britain, from Thabo Mbeki, Nelson Mandela's successor, who has an MA in economics from Sussex, to finance minister Gill Marcus, who set up a sandwich kiosk in Holborn, London, while in exile, and Frene Ginwala, speaker of the South African parliament. There might be spin-offs for Britain, he added, \"but what really matters is that some things are good in themselves, they do not need extra justification.\" The council is launching an appeal this spring.

They are designed to raise educational expectation and achievement by building on significant achievements made in the primary sector.</p> <p>The paper focuses on the secondary sector, but also covers early years and primary schools, building up to the transition to secondary schools and on to higher education or the jobs market. Ministers want education where \"every pupil is good at all the basics, and striving for excellence in the areas of their greatest strength; every school is good at all the basics and excellent at much more, and every school has a distinct mission, ethos and character\". The paper goes out for a four-month consultation. Among the key measures are:</p> <p><b> Targets for primary pupils</b></p> <p>Labour is on course to hit key targets for English and maths for 11-year-olds - 80% will achieve the standard set for their age (level 4 or above) in English, and 75% in mathematics, in the national curriculum (or so-called SATs) tests by 2002. But yesterday the government said that, amid clear evidence its literacy hour and daily maths lesson were working, it was time to raise the targets further. It wants 85% of 11-year-olds to achieve the standard for their age in English and in maths, and 35% to achieve the advanced level 5 in each subject. The latter appears to be recognition of many headteachers' complaints that top marks such as level 5 or 6 are not officially recognised, and that there was no incentive to aim for the highest marks.</p> <p><b> Ballet and music lessons</b></p> <p>One challenge is to ensure that a pupil's individual talents are fostered and weaknesses addressed through a broader curriculum and better support. The national curriculum will remain a basic entitlement, but ministers want all children to have greater access to extra-curricular activities and after-school clubs, regardless of social background or family income. At present 97% of primaries provide some extra-curricular support and seven out of 10 increased their provision between 1998 and 2000. Ministers wish that in time every primary child has the opportunity to learn a musical instrument, take up ballet, or try out one of a range of sports.</p> <p><b> Secondary school standards</b></p> <p>The government has introduced measures to improve the transition between primary and secondary, where there is evidence of a dip in ability. Summer schools have helped to ensure continuity of learning. Now proposals have been drawn up for a strategy to inject pace and drive up standards in the first years of secondary school. It centres on new targets, catch-up lessons for 12-year-olds who have fallen behind, and better teaching for 11- to 14-year-olds, backed up with \u00a382m in 2001/02. The government states, quite bluntly, that \"standards for pupils aged 11-14 are not high enough\", with teaching generally of a lesser quality. There is evidence of falling motivation and rising disaffection - largely responsible for creating the discipline problems highlighted in Ofsted's annual report last week.</p> <p>Ministers are to consult on reducing the time to reach assessment and tests at 14 (so-called key stage three) from three to two years from 2004. This would stop pupils \"marking time\" in the early years of secondary while adjusting to the new environment. It would also identify pupils ready to take GCSE examinations a year early, with some pupils also given the chance to do key stage three tests early.</p> <p><b> National academy for talented youth</b></p> <p>An academy for the brightest youngsters in England is to be created. The national centre for gifted and talented youth will be modelled on the US centre for talented youth at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, which helps more than 10,000 children each year across the United States. It offers individualised programmes taught by top professionals in three-week summer programmes on campuses each year, typically subjects not offered in the classroom - paleobiology, geopolitics, astronomy and logic.</p> <p>Although the UK centre would have a headquarters, its task will be to promote provision for gifted children in schools and establish intensive summer schools. Its first job will be to pilot university-based summer schools for young people with exceptional talent in one or more subjects. These will typically be among the 5% to 10% identified by their schools as \"gifted and talented\".</p> <p><b> External sponsors</b></p> <p>Ministers want to change the law to allow private sector and other external sponsors to take over schools that fail. The fresh start scheme, whereby schools reopen under a new name with new staff and with the help of government cash, has been fraught with difficulties. The government hopes instead to entice external sponsors such as businesses and voluntary groups to take over failing or under-performing schools - and even successful schools. Ministers hope other schools or educational partners, including the churches and even private schools, might want to get involved in running of schools, on a contract of say five to seven years with renewal subject to performance.</p> <p>The successful model for this is Kings school near Guildford in Surrey - the former failing Kings Manor school - taken over by a private sector partnership, '3Es', headed by Kingshurst city technology college in Solihull in the West Midlands. But the original takeover was the subject of a local row, with parents uniting against what they saw as the first full privatisation of a state school in the UK.</p> <p><b> Specialist and beacon schools</b></p> <p>The government wants nearly half all secondary schools specialising by 2006. Part involves creating specialisms in engineering, science, and business and enterprise, alongside the existing categories of technology, arts, languages, and sports. There are 536 specialist schools: 313 technology colleges, 99 language colleges, 67 sports colleges, and 57 arts colleges.</p> <p>The government has already signalled plans to allow further colleges to specialise from next September, bringing the total to 650. Previous plans anticipated 1,000 by September 2004, and the new announcement expands this to 1,500 by 2006. A new status is to be given to some high-performing specialist schools - advanced specialist schools - with emphasis on teacher and leadership training. Specialist schools qualify for extra funding and are allowed to select up to 10% of pupils according to aptitude.</p> <p>Ministers deny the expansion will lead to a two-tier comprehensive system. Instead they say some of the money given to specialist schools is dependent on sharing \"good practice\" with neighbouring schools. There are also plans to expand \"beacon\" schools which have demonstrated particularly good practice. By September 2001 there will be 2,000 beacon schools, including some 250 at secondary level. The government wants to nearly double the latter in the longer term.</p> <p><b> Religious and single faith schools</b></p> <p>Labour has helped create more schools supported by the churches and other major faiths. Some 560 secondaries are provided by the Anglican or the Catholic churches. For the first time, Muslim, Sikh and Greek Orthodox schools have been brought inside the state system, and given voluntary-aided status and government funding. Ministers wish to welcome more such schools, and those provided by other voluntary and community groups, where there is local demand.</p> <p>There are numerous applications from other minority faith schools in the pipeline, including the first Islamic secondary in Birmingham due to be considered this week. But the government is to change capital funding to encourage more to apply: the contribution required from the church or faith has been reduced from 15% to 10%.</p> <p><b> Teacher recruitment and retention</b></p> <p>As expected, the paper sets out proposals to recruit and retain entrants to the profession. In the shortage subjects of maths, science, languages, technology and English, the next three years' intake will have their student loan repaid over a period of 10 years, provided they remain teaching in the state sector - worth \u00a310,000 to a typical graduate.</p> <p>Undergraduates on traditional academic degrees will be able to take education modules and so gain part of a teaching qualification while an undergraduate. In addition, all undergraduates would have the opportunity of a placement as a teaching assistant. Other measures include on the job training in high-cost areas and incentives for those with teaching qualifications to return.</p> <p><b>Changing face of the next generation</b></p> <p>\u0095 Every primary school child to be entitled to learn a musical instrument and take up ballet</p> <p>\u0095 Higher targets for tests at age 11</p> <p>\u0095 Key stage three tests to be taken at age 13 rather than at 14</p> <p>\u0095 Bright students to take GCSEs early</p> <p>\u0095 Vocational GCSEs to be available for those who want them</p> <p>\u0095 Companies and voluntary organisations to support failing schools</p> <p>\u0095 More specialist schools (1,500 by 2006) with new subject specialisms in engineering, science and business</p> <p>\u0095 More beacon schools to spread best practice, and more city academies in areas of underachievement</p> <p>\u0095 Extra support for religious schools, with government contributions for capital spending increasing from 85% to 90%</p> <p>\u0095 New teachers in shortage subjects to have their loans written off</p> <p>\u0095 New education modules in degree courses to give undergraduates a taste of teaching</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.dfee.gov.uk/buildingonsuccess/pdf/schools.pdf\" target=\"_NEW\">The green paper in full (pdf file)</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.dfee.gov.uk/buildingonsuccess\" target=\"_NEW\"> DfEE Building on Success site</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "The government yesterday pledged to \"empower\" individual pupils and schools in a radical shake-up of secondary schools, which ministers hope will dramatically raise standards in the 21st century. Accepting that the educational standards of 11- to 14-year-olds are not high enough and that teaching is poor, Labour has set out a wide range of measures in its green paper, Schools: Building on Success. They are designed to raise educational expectation and achievement by building on significant achievements made in the primary sector. The paper focuses on the secondary sector, but also covers early years and primary schools, building up to the transition to secondary schools and on to higher education or the jobs market. Ministers want education where \"every pupil is good at all the basics, and striving for excellence in the areas of their greatest strength; every school is good at all the basics and excellent at much more, and every school has a distinct mission, ethos and character\". The paper goes out for a four-month consultation.

      "body": "<p> I do hope your school is giving you lots of support, because that's what you need right now. And I think you've made a very sensible decision not to take your GCSEs at the moment, because if you go into them feeling under pressure, you're very likely to feel the pressure all the more. </p> <p>One thing you might think about, though, is that you don't have to take all your GCSEs in one go. Maybe there are some subjects you are particularly good at or find less stressful than others - if so, you could consider taking two or three instead of the seven or eight you were maybe intending to take. Passing these exams would be a real confidence boost, and would give you a real \"can do\" attitude for continuing with your GCSEs, if that's what you want to do, the following year. </p> <p>If you decide you want to do your GCSEs once you've left school I don't think you'll find any problems - in most areas you will find colleges and schools tend to do the same boards, so you should find a college that follows the same board as your school. </p> <p>If you want to do your GCSEs right after leaving school, your school might let you use them just as an examination centre - you can ask them. Otherwise, most higher education colleges are centres for GCSEs, so don't worry about needing to register with an examination centre as your college or school will do this for you. </p> <p>Remember that you shouldn't have a problem picking up GCSEs in later life. The government is very keen on lifelong learning, and you'll have every possibility of carrying on if you want to. </p> <p><strong> George Turnbull </strong><br>The Assessment and Qualifications Alliance, exam board for GCSEs and A-levels </p> <p> Course work at your stage of life is stressful, and it's well known that the pressures do get to a lot of teenagers. I think it's important to set yourself some goals: maybe it's going to be an NVQ, or maybe a smaller number of GCSEs than you'd envisaged. </p> <p>Most teenagers have times of feeling low - one of the things that can help is to keep in touch with one or two friends. If you're not feeling up to going out, talk to them on the phone, or invite them over to see you. If you can, try to talk a bit about how you feel to one or other of your parents, or perhaps to a brother or sister. </p> <p>It's definitely going to help you to concentrate on what you're good at. Staying at school but reducing your academic aims will have the big advantage of keeping you in touch with your friends - if you're thinking of studying at home, you should bear in mind that although there would be pros and cons, it could be quite lonely. </p> <p>Don't forget to build \"fun\" activities into your life too: make sure you have time to go out shopping with your friends, to go to the cinema, to have coffee and to go swimming or do some other exercise. </p> <p>You might find it helpful to talk to a professional, for example a counsellor or a clinical psychologist. If you think this would help, ask your GP for a referral. Above all, be optimistic that you will get through this difficult time in your life and that things will all turn out OK. </p> <p> <strong> Dr Hugh Koch</strong><br>Chartered clinical psychologist </p> <p> You've had a lot to deal with over the last few months, and you've taken a very mature approach. You're clearly a sensible and conscientious young person, and that's a very positive start. </p> <p>I'd say if you have a reasonable expectation of doing well academically, it's probably going to be advisable to concentrate on a small number of core subjects - English, maths, science - or perhaps a couple of subjects you really enjoy. </p> <p>If you have a really strong career path in mind, then it might be worth looking at an NVQ course in that area. But you do need to take care in terms of what level of NVQ you're embarking on - the higher the level, the more academic they become and it might defeat the object if you find yourself very pressurised by this course. </p> <p>What you really need is to talk things through with someone you know and trust. </p> <p>My gut instinct is that you'd protect your future better if you opted for the smaller number of GCSEs initially, so that later you could either pick up on your academic studies or move on to an NVQ. </p> <p> <strong> David Scott</strong><br>Head of Calder High School in Mytholmroyd, West Yorks </p> <p><strong> Coming next </strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> My daughter has been offered a place at an excellent secondary school.

Otherwise, most higher education colleges are centres for GCSEs, so don't worry about needing to register with an examination centre as your college or school will do this for you. Remember that you shouldn't have a problem picking up GCSEs in later life. The government is very keen on lifelong learning, and you'll have every possibility of carrying on if you want to. George Turnbull The Assessment and Qualifications Alliance, exam board for GCSEs and A-levels Course work at your stage of life is stressful, and it's well known that the pressures do get to a lot of teenagers. I think it's important to set yourself some goals: maybe it's going to be an NVQ, or maybe a smaller number of GCSEs than you'd envisaged. Most teenagers have times of feeling low - one of the things that can help is to keep in touch with one or two friends. If you're not feeling up to going out, talk to them on the phone, or invite them over to see you. If you can, try to talk a bit about how you feel to one or other of your parents, or perhaps to a brother or sister. It's definitely going to help you to concentrate on what you're good at. Staying at school but reducing your academic aims will have the big advantage of keeping you in touch with your friends - if you're thinking of studying at home, you should bear in mind that although there would be pros and cons, it could be quite lonely. Don't forget to build \"fun\" activities into your life too: make sure you have time to go out shopping with your friends, to go to the cinema, to have coffee and to go swimming or do some other exercise. You might find it helpful to talk to a professional, for example a counsellor or a clinical psychologist. If you think this would help, ask your GP for a referral. Above all, be optimistic that you will get through this difficult time in your life and that things will all turn out OK. Dr Hugh Koch Chartered clinical psychologist You've had a lot to deal with over the last few months, and you've taken a very mature approach. You're clearly a sensible and conscientious young person, and that's a very positive start. I'd say if you have a reasonable expectation of doing well academically, it's probably going to be advisable to concentrate on a small number of core subjects - English, maths, science - or perhaps a couple of subjects you really enjoy. If you have a really strong career path in mind, then it might be worth looking at an NVQ course in that area. But you do need to take care in terms of what level of NVQ you're embarking on - the higher the level, the more academic they become and it might defeat the object if you find yourself very pressurised by this course. What you really need is to talk things through with someone you know and trust. My gut instinct is that you'd protect your future better if you opted for the smaller number of GCSEs initially, so that later you could either pick up on your academic studies or move on to an NVQ.

      "body": "<p>Joseph is learning Latin. He's a member of Mensa. Six months ago, he gained grade A in his ICT GCSE. \"He thinks he'll take a year off before he does his A-level,\" says his mother, Danielle Sanderson. Joseph is nine and a half. </p> <p>Despite his immense academic ability, Joseph attends the local primary school just a few hundred yards away from his Hertfordshire home. The government wants to ensure more children like Joseph flourish within the state system. </p> <p>In 1999, a programme for \"gifted and talented\" children was introduced as part of the Excellence in Cities (EiC) initiative. Over 1,000 inner-city schools were targeted to identity 5% to 10% of their pupils as \"gifted and talented\". A staggering \u00a329m was allocated to fund learning programmes for these children, \"gifted and talented co-ordinators\" at each school, and after-school masterclasses and summer schools for the exceptionally able. </p> <p>Last month, the education department announced EiC would be expanded to a third of all state secondary schools by 2004. </p> <p>To its supporters, EiC is exactly what the state system has long needed. \"There's been a feeling in the past that this type of youngster would get by - they'd make it. There is a group of gifted who will make it anyway. But there are quite a lot who don't engage with school as well as you might expect. You need a coherent strategy,\" says Deborah Eyre, head of the Research Centre for Able Pupils at Westminster Institute of Education. </p> <p>But to its critics, it is a costly, cynical attempt to keep middle-class children like Joseph, whose father is a finance director and whose mother gained an exhibition to read physics at Oxford, from fleeing the state system. </p> <p>For a start, what counts as \"gifted and talented\"? Parents often feel it is obvious. Joseph's talents are apparent and, according to his mother, always have been. \"When he was 14 months old I was driving past a Tesco's van and he said 'Tesco'. He could read it. By 15 months he was speaking in 10-word sentences.\" </p> <p>But even those who support the \"gifted and talented\" category struggle to define it. \"There are 1%-2% of children who are exceptionally bright,\" says Ken Bore, director of the National Association for Gifted Children. \"But on the broadest definition, up to 40% of the school population could be gifted in some way. We could be talking about half a million children.\" </p> <p>Rigorous tests aren't always the answer. \"IQ testing can be an indicator, but not a hard and fast diagnostic tool,\" says Bore. World-class tests are being developed and tested on nine- to 13-year-olds, to identify the top 10% academic achievers worldwide. But by focusing on the top 10% in each school, the EiC gifted and talented scheme draws in a far wider range of abilities. </p> <p>Even Eyre has reservations about the current criteria. \"For schools it's a problem what counts as gifted,\" she says. \"If you're in an inner-city school with low-achieving children and pick out a child who to you seems outstanding, then took that child and put them somewhere else, they might be very ordinary. You can be considered gifted in one school and not another.\" </p> <p>Inevitably, perhaps, given the subjective nature of the \"gifted and talented\" label, those who benefit from EiC tend to be self-selecting. \"The chances of middle-class families pushing for their kids to be on EiC schemes is much higher than working-class parents,\" says Helen Lucey, a researcher at King's College London's School of Education. </p> <p>From Lucey's sample of 45 high-IQ children, with the vast majority from working-class homes, only three were on gifted and talented schemes. All three were from professional middle-class families. </p> <p>Gwen Goodhew is the gifted and talented co-ordinator for Knowsley, where 900 children from 11 secondary schools have been chosen as particularly able. She is an ardent advocate of EiC, but admits that the take-up for the summer schools she runs has been slow. \"If I'm honest, it hasn't been easy to find the children because we're looking for those who come from a background where there is no higher education. They don't have the confidence to do it,\" she says. </p> <p>Newton Prep in Battersea, south London, a private primary school established to cater specifically for the intellectually gifted, aims to have 10% of its intake on means-tested scholarships. However, the trustees admit that very few poorer families have applied. Nearly all their pupils come from highly privileged backgrounds - scholarships or no scholarships. </p> <p>In the past, gifted has meant more than academically able - it has often meant plain weird. Parents of gifted and talented children are keen to emphasise how ordinary their offspring are. Julian Johnson, a university lecturer whose eight-year-old son Ben has exceptional academic ability, says, \"He's not a little Mozart. He's just very quick off the mark and has an enquiring mind. We're not talking strange, geeky genius.\" </p> <p>The EiC \"gifted\" tag, critics say, can exacerbate this misunderstanding. \"They call them 'the G&amp;Ts'\", says Lucey. \"Some of the kids don't want to know them. One boy said they get special treatment and go on special trips, just because they're quicker.\" </p> <p>This is Lucey's main concern: that by labelling clever children as \"gifted and talented\", the less able are also being stigmatised. \"It's all about exclusion, not inclusion at all. To pick up 10% of kids, you've got to exclude 90%. The kids who aren't chosen talk really emotionally about not being good enough. Some kids feels sorry for the G&amp;T children because they're nerds - but it's contempt hiding envy.\" </p> <p>But even once the few have been chosen, what is to be done with them? In the bad old school days, before EiC, the answer was often nothing. Ben spent literacy hour at his local state primary school in East Sussex sitting on the carpet and staring out of the window, while at home he devoured astronomy books and Harry Potter. \"He was getting bored, frustrated and isolated,\" says his father. \"Being clever seemed not to count for very much. It felt like he wasn't valued.\" </p> <p>Johnson wanted his son to skip a year. \"He was streets ahead, and was the oldest in his class. The head felt it would set a precedent, and refused. Yet the same school happily keeps other children back a year. I always said we'd never send our children to private school. But in the end we had no choice.\" </p> <p>Ben is now at a \u00a32,200-per-term school, 13 miles from home, where they agreed to accelerate him a year. \"He's much livelier and more confident - everything an eight-year-old should be. We've got our child back,\" says Johnson. </p> <p>Like many families, the Johnsons see acceleration as the only solution. But Eyre is not so sure. \"Acceleration is one option available, but it shouldn't be a wholesale policy. If you do things earlier than anybody else, what is the eventual outcome? You would have to go to university earlier, but by the time you're 30, who cares? What's the gain?\" </p> <p>Even in the EiC scheme, precisely how gifted children can be helped is unclear. Most schools simply add on extras or remove children from regular classes. </p> <p>The children on Gwen Goodhew's Knowsley scheme, for example, get extra maths classes on Saturday mornings and free week-long residential summer schools. The top 30 year 10s were taken to Oxford for two days during term-time. One group of Knowsley G&amp;Ts recently spent two days on a performing arts programme while their less able peers got on with regular classes. Goodhew does not see this as the cause of jealousies. \"If you want to be in it you have to work a bit harder,\" she says simply. </p> <p>But Eyre is concerned that able has come to mean extra workload. \"Lots of schools think EiC means after-school activities. But gifted children are no more studious than anybody else, so they don't want to stay and do extra work. </p> <p>\"What we need are more flexible schools. We've gone a long way towards making schools more flexible for pupils who find learning difficult. We need to make them sufficiently flexible for those who can go further.\" </p> <p> National Association for Gifted Children helpline: 01908 673677.

You can be considered gifted in one school and not another.\" Inevitably, perhaps, given the subjective nature of the \"gifted and talented\" label, those who benefit from EiC tend to be self-selecting. \"The chances of middle-class families pushing for their kids to be on EiC schemes is much higher than working-class parents,\" says Helen Lucey, a researcher at King's College London's School of Education. From Lucey's sample of 45 high-IQ children, with the vast majority from working-class homes, only three were on gifted and talented schemes. All three were from professional middle-class families. Gwen Goodhew is the gifted and talented co-ordinator for Knowsley, where 900 children from 11 secondary schools have been chosen as particularly able. She is an ardent advocate of EiC, but admits that the take-up for the summer schools she runs has been slow. \"If I'm honest, it hasn't been easy to find the children because we're looking for those who come from a background where there is no higher education. They don't have the confidence to do it,\" she says. Newton Prep in Battersea, south London, a private primary school established to cater specifically for the intellectually gifted, aims to have 10% of its intake on means-tested scholarships. However, the trustees admit that very few poorer families have applied. Nearly all their pupils come from highly privileged backgrounds - scholarships or no scholarships. In the past, gifted has meant more than academically able - it has often meant plain weird. Parents of gifted and talented children are keen to emphasise how ordinary their offspring are. Julian Johnson, a university lecturer whose eight-year-old son Ben has exceptional academic ability, says, \"He's not a little Mozart. He's just very quick off the mark and has an enquiring mind. We're not talking strange, geeky genius.\" The EiC \"gifted\" tag, critics say, can exacerbate this misunderstanding. \"They call them 'the G&amp;Ts'\", says Lucey. \"Some of the kids don't want to know them. One boy said they get special treatment and go on special trips, just because they're quicker.\" This is Lucey's main concern: that by labelling clever children as \"gifted and talented\", the less able are also being stigmatised. \"It's all about exclusion, not inclusion at all. To pick up 10% of kids, you've got to exclude 90%. The kids who aren't chosen talk really emotionally about not being good enough. Some kids feels sorry for the G&amp;T children because they're nerds - but it's contempt hiding envy.\" But even once the few have been chosen, what is to be done with them? In the bad old school days, before EiC, the answer was often nothing. Ben spent literacy hour at his local state primary school in East Sussex sitting on the carpet and staring out of the window, while at home he devoured astronomy books and Harry Potter. \"He was getting bored, frustrated and isolated,\" says his father. \"Being clever seemed not to count for very much. It felt like he wasn't valued.\" Johnson wanted his son to skip a year. \"He was streets ahead, and was the oldest in his class. The head felt it would set a precedent, and refused. Yet the same school happily keeps other children back a year. I always said we'd never send our children to private school. But in the end we had no choice.\" Ben is now at a \u00a32,200-per-term school, 13 miles from home, where they agreed to accelerate him a year. \"He's much livelier and more confident - everything an eight-year-old should be. We've got our child back,\" says Johnson. Like many families, the Johnsons see acceleration as the only solution. But Eyre is not so sure. \"Acceleration is one option available, but it shouldn't be a wholesale policy. If you do things earlier than anybody else, what is the eventual outcome? You would have to go to university earlier, but by the time you're 30, who cares? What's the gain?\" Even in the EiC scheme, precisely how gifted children can be helped is unclear. Most schools simply add on extras or remove children from regular classes. The children on Gwen Goodhew's Knowsley scheme, for example, get extra maths classes on Saturday mornings and free week-long residential summer schools. The top 30 year 10s were taken to Oxford for two days during term-time. One group of Knowsley G&amp;Ts recently spent two days on a performing arts programme while their less able peers got on with regular classes. Goodhew does not see this as the cause of jealousies. \"If you want to be in it you have to work a bit harder,\" she says simply. But Eyre is concerned that able has come to mean extra workload. \"Lots of schools think EiC means after-school activities. But gifted children are no more studious than anybody else, so they don't want to stay and do extra work. \"What we need are more flexible schools. We've gone a long way towards making schools more flexible for pupils who find learning difficult. We need to make them sufficiently flexible for those who can go further.\" National Association for Gifted Children helpline: 01908 673677. Website: www.nagcbritain.org.uk",

For the third time, The Guardian has joined forces with BBC Proms, the world's greatest music festival, to offer a unique opportunity for all young composers. </p> <p>To enter, all you have to do is write a five-minute composition. The music can be in any style - string quartets, heavy metal, or the kind of song that would knock the socks off the Popstars judges. Just write the piece out (using either standard or graphic notation) and record it on audio cassette, CD, DAT or Minidisc and send it to us to arrive no later than June 1. (For full details of how to enter, see \"Competition details\", below.) </p> <p>Our distinguished panel of judges will select three overall winners. Each winner will get prizes any composer would dream of. Not only will they have their composition broadcast in full on prime-time BBC Radio 3, but Yamaha has once again generously donated six keyboards, one for each of the three winners, and one for each of their schools. </p> <p>And this year, for the first time, there are no losers. Everybody who enters will get a prize. All contestants will be invited with a parent or teacher to a special Young Composers' Day at the Proms on Sunday July 29. </p> <p>This will include a presentation by the composer Sally Beamish about how she created her latest work. There will also be an advice session from professional composers and songwriters about composing as a career, a peek-in on rehearsals for that evening's Prom and two tickets for that concert, which will feature the world premiere performance of a BBC-commissioned piece. </p> <p>Four days earlier, on July 25, the winners and 20 runners-up will be invited to London to attend a rehearsal by Leonard Slatkin, the chief conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra. They will be able to discuss their work at a session with Slatkin and the composers Mark-Anthony Turnage and Fraser Trainer. </p> <p>For any young person who enjoys writing music, our competition is a must, says one of last year's winners. \"I was so chuffed,\" recalls Ollie Haydon-Mulligan, 14, who won with Merlin, a piece of jazz funk. \"It's given me great encouragement and a lot of motivation to keep going. I'd encourage anybody who likes composing to have a go.\" </p> <p>As for the judges, we had such an enthusiastic response last year, and were so impressed with the entries that we are delighted to do it all over again. Andrew Kurowski, BBC executive producer responsible for new music, says: \"I had no idea the entries would be quite as characterful and impressive.\" </p> <p>Another judge, the composer Gary Carpenter said: \"We had entrants, and not just the prize-winners, whose work would be taken seriously by any of the major conservatories.\" </p> <p>So, whether it's your ambition one day to hear your symphony played at the BBC Proms, or to write a number one hit, or you simply get a kick out of creating music, enter the only national competition for composers of your age. </p> <p><strong>Peter Kingston</strong></p> <p><strong>You are the future of music</strong></p> <p> Who are the most important people in music: performers, composers, or the folk who listen - and pay? </p> <p>As a conductor, I've been lucky to work with many fine instrumentalists and singers, some of them among the best in the world. They are unquestionably very important artists. </p> <p>And together we've performed for some wonderful audiences. This summer I'm very much looking forward to coming back to the BBC Proms as chief conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra. Prom audiences are special and there is always a great atmosphere in the Royal Albert Hall. I'm particularly looking forward to becoming the first American to conduct the famous Last Night of the Proms. </p> <p>At the risk of ruffling a few feathers, though, I would say that no musical group can be more important than composers. And none is more vital than the next generation of young composers. That's you. You are literally the future of music. </p> <p>Without you, the rest of us shall have nothing to play. That's not quite true, of course. There is all the music that has already been written. So long as there are orchestras around, they will always be playing Beethoven and Mozart, and all the other great composers. </p> <p>But music needs a constant supply of fresh material if it is going to thrive as a living, vibrant art rather than just survive as some antique curiosity. And that is what we are hoping for from you. In fact, we are depending on it. </p> <p>Composing is generally a solitary activity. I know. I've composed a bit myself. I also know that if you've got people to guide you, that can be an invaluable help. It is also great to have friends who can perform your stuff. If not, composing can be a very lonely business, especially if you don't know any other young people who do it. Sometimes you are the only person you know who is writing music seriously. </p> <p>Like all artists, composers depend on audiences, whatever the style of their music. They need feedback. They need to hear the cheers. And it is useful, but not so thrilling, to get the muted applause, if not the occasional raspberry. </p> <p>That is why The Guardian/BBC Proms competition is so important. For one thing, you'll find out that your hobby isn't so strange after all. There are other young people all over the country doing it. </p> <p>How will you find this out?

      "body": "<p>Cross-legged or kneeling, the children meditate, their eyes closed, before a shrine in the Sun room. There is a bowl of water on the purple-robed altar, a lit candle, some incense and a statue of the Buddha. </p> <p>A minute's silence ensues before the peace is broken by the tinkling of a Tibetan bell. Kevin Fossey, headteacher of the Dharma School in Brighton, England's only Buddhist school, relates an ancient Tibetan story about the worried man and the big-headed man. The moral of the tale - about telling tall stories - acknowledges the difficulty of trying to ascertain the truth, but emphasises the importance of trying. </p> <p>The 70 boys and girls and sprinkling of mothers are then exhorted to send waves of heartfelt loving kindness to their families, friends and even people they have difficulty getting on with. Finally, Fossey says we must also be generous with ourselves and give ourselves a smile as well. </p> <p>Fossey, 49, has been to Dharamsala in northern India on several occasions to help the Tibetan government in exile refine its teacher training programmes. He is about to give up the headship and the school is looking for his successor. Only practising Buddhists need apply. </p> <p>\"The school is strong. It's established and is not seen as that wacky little school on the hill,\" he says. \"Visitors say, 'Oh, it's quite normal, really', as if we all went round in robes bowing to each other all the time.\" </p> <p>I have arrived at the school in the middle of a puja, a devotion or spell of living in the moment. The assembly is taking place in the White House, a 1930s detached house in its own grounds, in the lee of the South Downs. A Tibetan chant follows - Om Mani Padme Hung, literally the jewel in the flower of the lotus. </p> <p>After a prayer, the assembled throng bows three times: once to thank the Buddha for being; once to thank him for his teachings - dharma - and once for the community of people sharing this moment. </p> <p>The private school - fees \u00a33,000 a year - was founded in September 1994 to cater for Brighton's flourishing Buddhist community. It started off with four children aged four to six in the living room of a parent's house, but moved in 1995. </p> <p>Today, half its pupils come from families that practise Buddhism, while the others come from various religious and secular backgrounds. Several of the school's teachers, including the head, are practising Buddhists, and monks from Tibet and other Buddhist traditions regularly visit. Brighton's Buddhist community includes groups representing Tibetan, Zen, Gaia House, Friends of the Western Buddhist Order and Theravadan traditions. The school itself is open to all traditions. </p> <p>Buddhist doctrines are not taught in a didactic way, rather the school is infused by Buddhist principles exemplified in teachers' behaviour. Key principles include developing honesty, respect for all sentient beings, co-operation, concentration, self-discipline and resourcefulness. </p> <p>Daily meditation gives children periods of stillness and inner quiet. Opportunities are taken to demonstrate the relationship of all living things with their environment. Children are encouraged to consider the consequences of their actions and to be aware of the moment. They are also taught - bearing in mind that the Buddha taught that everything is impermanent - to cope with uncertainty and loss. </p> <p>All pupils and staff undertake to maintain the five Buddhist precepts: take care of all living things; respect property and not take things that are not ours; accept responsibility in relationships; understand the dangers of substance abuse; and, finally, speak honestly and kindly. </p> <p>Alison Mayo, who has taught at the school since it started and set up the nursery, is a practising Buddhist. She says that the school allows space for things to happen. </p> <p>\"Rather than filling every moment, there is time to reflect on what you are doing. The children get a lot of individual attention,\" she added. \"Because the classes are small, the teaching is not about controlling large groups. There is a strong sense of community. </p> <p>\"Buddhism is a way of life rather than a set of beliefs. It is not a matter of saying people should believe in a particular thing.

      "bodyText": "Cross-legged or kneeling, the children meditate, their eyes closed, before a shrine in the Sun room. There is a bowl of water on the purple-robed altar, a lit candle, some incense and a statue of the Buddha. A minute's silence ensues before the peace is broken by the tinkling of a Tibetan bell. Kevin Fossey, headteacher of the Dharma School in Brighton, England's only Buddhist school, relates an ancient Tibetan story about the worried man and the big-headed man. The moral of the tale - about telling tall stories - acknowledges the difficulty of trying to ascertain the truth, but emphasises the importance of trying. The 70 boys and girls and sprinkling of mothers are then exhorted to send waves of heartfelt loving kindness to their families, friends and even people they have difficulty getting on with. Finally, Fossey says we must also be generous with ourselves and give ourselves a smile as well. Fossey, 49, has been to Dharamsala in northern India on several occasions to help the Tibetan government in exile refine its teacher training programmes. He is about to give up the headship and the school is looking for his successor. Only practising Buddhists need apply. \"The school is strong. It's established and is not seen as that wacky little school on the hill,\" he says. \"Visitors say, 'Oh, it's quite normal, really', as if we all went round in robes bowing to each other all the time.\" I have arrived at the school in the middle of a puja, a devotion or spell of living in the moment. The assembly is taking place in the White House, a 1930s detached house in its own grounds, in the lee of the South Downs. A Tibetan chant follows - Om Mani Padme Hung, literally the jewel in the flower of the lotus. After a prayer, the assembled throng bows three times: once to thank the Buddha for being; once to thank him for his teachings - dharma - and once for the community of people sharing this moment. The private school - fees \u00a33,000 a year - was founded in September 1994 to cater for Brighton's flourishing Buddhist community. It started off with four children aged four to six in the living room of a parent's house, but moved in 1995. Today, half its pupils come from families that practise Buddhism, while the others come from various religious and secular backgrounds. Several of the school's teachers, including the head, are practising Buddhists, and monks from Tibet and other Buddhist traditions regularly visit. Brighton's Buddhist community includes groups representing Tibetan, Zen, Gaia House, Friends of the Western Buddhist Order and Theravadan traditions. The school itself is open to all traditions. Buddhist doctrines are not taught in a didactic way, rather the school is infused by Buddhist principles exemplified in teachers' behaviour. Key principles include developing honesty, respect for all sentient beings, co-operation, concentration, self-discipline and resourcefulness. Daily meditation gives children periods of stillness and inner quiet. Opportunities are taken to demonstrate the relationship of all living things with their environment. Children are encouraged to consider the consequences of their actions and to be aware of the moment. They are also taught - bearing in mind that the Buddha taught that everything is impermanent - to cope with uncertainty and loss. All pupils and staff undertake to maintain the five Buddhist precepts: take care of all living things; respect property and not take things that are not ours; accept responsibility in relationships; understand the dangers of substance abuse; and, finally, speak honestly and kindly. Alison Mayo, who has taught at the school since it started and set up the nursery, is a practising Buddhist. She says that the school allows space for things to happen. \"Rather than filling every moment, there is time to reflect on what you are doing. The children get a lot of individual attention,\" she added. \"Because the classes are small, the teaching is not about controlling large groups. There is a strong sense of community. \"Buddhism is a way of life rather than a set of beliefs. It is not a matter of saying people should believe in a particular thing. It's easy for non-Buddhists to feel at home here.\" Dawn Sackett and her partner, Adrian Weston, who run a marketing and PR agency in Brighton, have a 10-year-old son, Crusoe, at the school. They moved him from a primary school where he was floundering in a 100-strong year group. \"We are not Buddhists, but it's a small school and I like Buddhism's five basic principles,\" Sackett says. \"Crusoe has changed from being an unhappy, disruptive child to a happy, settled child. The school is very good at working on social relationships between the children.\" Thomas Chandler, 11, who has Asperger's syndrome, which makes him prone to fits of temper, said: \"I like this school.

      "byline": "Phil Revell",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong> I hear Tony Blair has another new plan for education, education, education?</strong> </p> <p> You're right. As the election draws closer, Blair is rolling out his 10-year plan. Central to this is a huge expansion of the flagship specialist schools programme, which allows schools to concentrate on one subject area. </p> <p>Currently there are over 500 schools specialising in technology, sport, the arts or languages. In return for a promise to raise standards across the curriculum, schools receive a capital grant of \u00a3100,000 plus an extra \u00a3123 per year per pupil (up to 1,000 pupils), worth over \u00a3100,000 a year for a typical secondary school. </p> <p>The government aims to have 1,500 schools in place by 2006, which would mean that every other secondary school would have a specialism. And there will be new specialisms, with engineering, science and business and enterprise colleges likely to open in September 2002. </p> <p> <strong> And remind me - where did this idea come from?</strong> </p> <p> Specialist schools were a Conservative initiative brought in to cover the cracks of a failing City Technology Colleges programme. Margaret Thatcher saw CTCs as an opportunity for business to invest in education. Companies were invited to fund new schools, which would effectively be independent, able to set their own curriculum and experiment with new teaching methods. But only 15 were created and big-name donors were hard to come by. </p> <p>Specialist schools were seen as a more acceptable way to involve business and Labour, far from abandoning the initiative, has expanded it. </p> <p> <strong> Arts, languages, science - these are things I'd expect all schools to cover. Why should some get more money to teach the same subjects?</strong> </p> <p> Any state secondary can apply for specialist status, but a school would have to be confident of success before beginning the process. Schools have to submit a three-year plan outlining how they propose to raise standards. They also have to find \u00a350,000 of seed corn money. Few \"failing\" schools would want to take that kind of challenge on board. </p> <p>Schools are expected to make efforts to raise as much as they can locally, but a safety net exists for schools in poorer areas. The Technology Colleges Trust (TCT) acts as a mediator between donors keen to support the programme and schools in need of assistance. </p> <p> <strong> Schools are always moaning about extra initiatives - why are they so keen to sign up to this one?</strong> </p> <p> For the additional funding - worth about half a million pounds over three years. A recent report by the London School of Economics concluded that the popularity of the programme among heads was largely related to the extra money. </p> <p>More than half the heads questioned by LSE admitted that their supposed specialism was not in fact the school's strongest teaching area, and the same number said that extra funding had been their primary motive for becoming a specialist school. </p> <p>At the Centre for the Study of Comprehensive Schools (CSCS), director Mark Hewlett admitted that that had been the case when he applied for specialist status at Rawlings comprehensive in Leicestershire. \"We went for specialist status because we could not afford to disadvantage our kids by depriving them of that money,\" said Hewlett, who has since left the school. </p> <p> <strong> Cash for Sats, then? Or is there some other way of deciding which schools specialise and which children benefit? I don't fancy complicating my housing arrangements by being forced to choose whether to live in an arty, business-like or Francophile catchment area.</strong> </p> <p> Bids are assessed by the DfEE but there doesn't appear to be any national plan to distribute schools evenly across the country. There are now 536 specialist schools in operation: 313 in technology, 99 in language, 67 in sports and 57 in arts. </p> <p>The dominance of technology is partly explained by the fact that the arts, sports and languages categories were added in 1997.

      "bodyText": "I hear Tony Blair has another new plan for education, education, education? You're right. As the election draws closer, Blair is rolling out his 10-year plan. Central to this is a huge expansion of the flagship specialist schools programme, which allows schools to concentrate on one subject area. Currently there are over 500 schools specialising in technology, sport, the arts or languages. In return for a promise to raise standards across the curriculum, schools receive a capital grant of \u00a3100,000 plus an extra \u00a3123 per year per pupil (up to 1,000 pupils), worth over \u00a3100,000 a year for a typical secondary school. The government aims to have 1,500 schools in place by 2006, which would mean that every other secondary school would have a specialism. And there will be new specialisms, with engineering, science and business and enterprise colleges likely to open in September 2002. And remind me - where did this idea come from? Specialist schools were a Conservative initiative brought in to cover the cracks of a failing City Technology Colleges programme. Margaret Thatcher saw CTCs as an opportunity for business to invest in education. Companies were invited to fund new schools, which would effectively be independent, able to set their own curriculum and experiment with new teaching methods. But only 15 were created and big-name donors were hard to come by. Specialist schools were seen as a more acceptable way to involve business and Labour, far from abandoning the initiative, has expanded it. Arts, languages, science - these are things I'd expect all schools to cover. Why should some get more money to teach the same subjects? Any state secondary can apply for specialist status, but a school would have to be confident of success before beginning the process. Schools have to submit a three-year plan outlining how they propose to raise standards. They also have to find \u00a350,000 of seed corn money. Few \"failing\" schools would want to take that kind of challenge on board. Schools are expected to make efforts to raise as much as they can locally, but a safety net exists for schools in poorer areas. The Technology Colleges Trust (TCT) acts as a mediator between donors keen to support the programme and schools in need of assistance. Schools are always moaning about extra initiatives - why are they so keen to sign up to this one? For the additional funding - worth about half a million pounds over three years. A recent report by the London School of Economics concluded that the popularity of the programme among heads was largely related to the extra money. More than half the heads questioned by LSE admitted that their supposed specialism was not in fact the school's strongest teaching area, and the same number said that extra funding had been their primary motive for becoming a specialist school. At the Centre for the Study of Comprehensive Schools (CSCS), director Mark Hewlett admitted that that had been the case when he applied for specialist status at Rawlings comprehensive in Leicestershire. \"We went for specialist status because we could not afford to disadvantage our kids by depriving them of that money,\" said Hewlett, who has since left the school. Cash for Sats, then? Or is there some other way of deciding which schools specialise and which children benefit? I don't fancy complicating my housing arrangements by being forced to choose whether to live in an arty, business-like or Francophile catchment area. Bids are assessed by the DfEE but there doesn't appear to be any national plan to distribute schools evenly across the country. There are now 536 specialist schools in operation: 313 in technology, 99 in language, 67 in sports and 57 in arts. The dominance of technology is partly explained by the fact that the arts, sports and languages categories were added in 1997. But the ability to spend thousands on computers has also made technology more attractive. So is my child expected to decide at the age of 11 whether he's a budding Richard Branson or a would-be Sam Mendes? How can the school tell? In theory, specialist schools are able to select up to 10% of their pupils. Applicants might be asked to bring in artwork or perform on a musical instrument, although languages assessment is more difficult, because few primary schools teach languages. But in practice few schools select. The education department estimates that only 7% of existing specialist schools do so - a figure confirmed by the TCT. But schools admit that they may be forced to select where they are massively oversubscribed. Let's get this straight: better schools will get more cash and be allowed to pick pupils; meanwhile, the school that has been refused specialist status will be left with less money and the kids who didn't manage to fight their way into the specialist school.

It seems that it is no exaggeration to point out that Corus owed its early strength to the college, the largest in Wales, comprising of six campuses and catering for more than two thirds of the entire Welsh further education sector. </p> <p>A few years ago, explained vice-principal Jeffrey Robinson, it was primarily responsible for introducing to the production lines a series of \"team training programmes\" designed to make groups of up to 30 steel workers more adept at tackling technical problems as and when they occurred in the steel-making process. </p> <p>\"We've had a long association of working with the firm and the team training scheme we did helped to make it hugely productive.\" At one time Corus was producing 920 tonnes of steel per head of worker compared to the next best in the world, 700 tonnes. </p> <p>\"The idea was we'd train teams of steel workers to maintain production if a problem cropped up, rather than resorting to the traditional habit of waiting, and hence being inefficient, for a team equipped with separate skills to turn up and sort things out.\" </p> <p>This example of how further education responds to the pressing needs of industry will have pleased Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary, who sets great store by the ability of education and training institutions to pick up the pieces when things fall apart. Although his suggestion on radio that re-training was the answer provoked sneering disbelief from Today programme presenter John Humphries, Byers stuck to his guns, reminding the audience that a new learning and skills era was unfolding out there. </p> <p>The minister didn't have much evidence to wave, so he may care to take note of the experience of Sutton Coldfield College, which found itself in the middle of an industrial crisis 10 months ago when the local Rover plant was shoved onto the hard-shoulder by owners BMW. A lot of steel, of course, had been shifted from Corus to make the Rover vehicles. </p> <p>Graham Jones, principal of Sutton Coldfield College, says there are four main courses of action. </p> <p>\"We got in touch with the unions because they were the most effective way for us to get our message across. </p> <p>\"Then we put in dedicated support from the careers service to link advice and make sure new career chances were spelt out. </p> <p>\"The next thing was to check all our opportunities were coordinated, making sure as far as possible that our courses were relevant and accessible.\" </p> <p>But the most important lesson, Jones believes, was not to delay their response. </p> <p>\"You have to move quickly, which is what we did. We didn't wait for official backing from the Further Education Funding Council to run extra courses. We decided to leap into the tide and worry later about funding.\" </p> <p>Back in Wales it is understood that the Welsh Assembly wants some recent money earmarked for flood prevention to be re-directed to the Welsh funding council to allow colleges like Coleg Gwent to mop up with far more success. It is a pointed sign of how education and training -alongside rising floods - can be viewed as an emergency deserving contingency planning and rapid responses. </p> <p>While Byers puts his faith in further education to ride to the rescue, Malcolm Wicks, the lifelong learning minister, says he is wary about current weaknesses in college provision, particularly in engineering and construction industries. </p> <p>\"Construction industry employers are finding it increasingly difficult to attract new workers, especially women, ethnic minorities and older workers,\" he laments, casting a steely eye on further education. </p> <p>Fortunately, claims Robinson, Coleg Gwent has a proven track record of responding to local difficulties when they flare up, with a range of appropriate tactics to interest workers in the vast range of courses they put on. </p> <p>\"There is sufficient gloom in the area and we feel very close to it,\" says Robinson. \"Our job now is to customise our courses and not add to the gloom. We are ready to go.\"</p>",

Graham Jones, principal of Sutton Coldfield College, says there are four main courses of action. \"We got in touch with the unions because they were the most effective way for us to get our message across. \"Then we put in dedicated support from the careers service to link advice and make sure new career chances were spelt out. \"The next thing was to check all our opportunities were coordinated, making sure as far as possible that our courses were relevant and accessible.\" But the most important lesson, Jones believes, was not to delay their response. \"You have to move quickly, which is what we did. We didn't wait for official backing from the Further Education Funding Council to run extra courses. We decided to leap into the tide and worry later about funding.\" Back in Wales it is understood that the Welsh Assembly wants some recent money earmarked for flood prevention to be re-directed to the Welsh funding council to allow colleges like Coleg Gwent to mop up with far more success. It is a pointed sign of how education and training -alongside rising floods - can be viewed as an emergency deserving contingency planning and rapid responses. While Byers puts his faith in further education to ride to the rescue, Malcolm Wicks, the lifelong learning minister, says he is wary about current weaknesses in college provision, particularly in engineering and construction industries. \"Construction industry employers are finding it increasingly difficult to attract new workers, especially women, ethnic minorities and older workers,\" he laments, casting a steely eye on further education. Fortunately, claims Robinson, Coleg Gwent has a proven track record of responding to local difficulties when they flare up, with a range of appropriate tactics to interest workers in the vast range of courses they put on. \"There is sufficient gloom in the area and we feel very close to it,\" says Robinson. \"Our job now is to customise our courses and not add to the gloom. We are ready to go.\"",

      "bodyText": "Trade and industry secretary Stephen Byers has confirmed that the government is to run pilots offering free digital television equipment, as part of the new white paper on enterprise, skills and innovation. The news comes as the chief executive of the Independent Television Commission, Patricia Hodgson, said she thought a UK-wide set-top box giveaway would be \"inevitable\" before analogue switch-off. Mr Byers today launched the white paper, called Opportunity for All, which is designed to boost access to what the government calls the \"knowledge economy\". The white paper makes provision for small-scale pilots for localised communities, where the government will assess the impact the technology has on people's lives. Meanwhile, giving evidence today before the select committee for culture media and sport into the communications white paper, Ms Hodgson said a digital equipment giveaway \"will have to happen\". Ms Hodgson, a former BBC strategy chief, told the committee that broadcasters had a responsibility to do \"as much as we can\" to speed up the uptake of digital. She was responding to fears expressed by committee members that the target for 95% of consumers having digital TV before the analogue signal is switched off may not be reached by the 2006 target date for switch-off. Ms Hodgson added that she was \"struck by the way in which British broadcasters have managed to move into digital television\". Quizzed by the select committee on the ITC's decision to force ITV to reinstate News at Ten, Ms Hodgson defended the move. She pointed out that the combined average audience for the BBC1 and ITV late evening news programmes had risen from 7.5m to 10m since the two bulletins had been head to head.

From next year, the annual review - in which the ITC holds the commercial broadcasters to detailed and sometimes painful account for the programming promises made in their licence submissions - will make way for a programme statement drawn up by the broadcasters themselves. An ITC spokesman confirmed the regulator will next month be contacting the commercial broadcasters to begin the process of drawing up the statements of programming policy. The ITC will review whether the broadcasters have kept to their programming commitments in 2002. The spokesman added that the move reflected the recommendations made in last year's communications white paper for a less prescriptive assessment of programming output by the new single communications regulator Ofcom. The BBC's programming services will remain outside the ITC's remit. But once Ofcom is set up, the BBC will also have to draw up a programming statement for the new regulator to review on an annual basis. The ITC wil be sending a statement of principle to ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 requesting a \"diversity statement\" on their programming outputs, to be submitted in March. The statement of principle will provide a framework for the implementation of the white paper recommendations before new legislation is passed. The broadcasters' \"diversity statements\" will then be measured against actual performance by the ITC after 12 months. ITC chief executive Patricia Hodgson, speaking last night at the ITN European Media Forum Lecture, said the commission had decided to \"step back from our own assessment of ITV, Channel 4, and Channel 5. \"Instead, we'll ask licensees to volunteer a rolling annual statement of how they plan to deliver their remits,\" she added.

      "bodyText": "The BBC has brought forward a documentary on British yachtswoman Ellen MacArthur, after her record-breaking round-the-world voyage attracted massive media interest. The BBC1 documentary about Ms MacArthur's extraordinary feat - becoming the youngest person ever to circumnavigate the world single-handed and in the fastest time for a woman - was originally scheduled for the autumn, but will now go out on March 1. A BBC film crew met Ms MacArthur's yacht at Les Sables d'Olonne, a fishing village on the French Atlantic coast, when she completed her remarkable vovage on Sunday. The rest of the programme will be made up of footage from four cameras installed on Ms MacArthur's yacht, video diary footage and an interview filmed before she began the race. The BBC Wales documentary, which was originally commissioned as a 30-minute programme in the Extreme Lives series, will now be made into an hour-long special. A BBC Wales spokeswoman said the decision to bring forward the documentary had only been taken today. \"It's great for us that she did so well, and we wanted to move fast with this one and show everyone how she did it,\" said the spokeswoman.",

Yesterday, his emergency team finalised details of a three-month plan, with immediate effect. As the only agencies within the disasters emergency committee (DEC) to focus specifically on older people's needs in emergency and development settings, HelpAge International and partner HelpAge India have a critical role to play, both on the ground and in persuading other agencies to take account of older people in their planning of recovery activities and longer-term reconstruction work.

In this scenario, even if a Palestinian state would not turn its sights on Israel, it could very well threaten Jordan in the hope of linking up with Iraq - a natural Palestinian ally - and create a huge, expansive, terror-sponsoring state on the border of Saudi Arabia.\" This is a prospect that would obviously concern the US and Europe and which will be raised by Sharon representatives in their forays abroad.\"</p> <p>The Tel Aviv daily, <a href=\"http://www.haaretzdaily.com\" target=\"_new\">Ha'aretz</a>, helpfully provides an English translation of leading articles in the Palestinian papers. They cannot make comfortable reading for Israelis.</p> <p>Al Hayat al-Jadida, for example, warns the incoming prime minister: \"We are willing to stand up to anyone wishing to do us harm. We are prepared to negotiate fairly, if he shows genuine desire to negotiate a fair and comprehensive solution of peace. We do not expect Sharon to be merciful toward our children, trees and land. Occupation knows no mercy. But we will remain on our land, we will defend ourselves and continue to fight for our legitimate rights. Sooner or later, justice will be done.\"</p> <p>Al Ayyam asks whether the Israeli voters realised what they were doing in the February 6 election, but has no doubt about the outcome: \"The Israelis are offering us another round of conflict, which may be the most difficult yet. We and the Israelis will suffer much before the Israeli voters realise - on their next trip to the polls, perhaps in a few months - that peace and security can only be achieved by following one path, and that this path certainly does not run by Sharon's door.\"</p> <p>Ha'aretz commentator Yoel Marcus notes that Sharon is radiating the same aura of restraint and moderation that featured in his election campaign. Marcus asks, pertinently: \"If we aren't witnessing the miracle of the leopard changing its spots, there's still the question of how exactly he will bring peace without removing a single settlement, without dividing Jerusalem and leaving 42% of the territories in Palestinian hands. That he's got something up his sleeve is certain. The riddle is: When will the real Sharon come out of the closet?\"</p> <p><b>Related stories</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,437475,00.html\">13.02.01: Israel kills 'militant' as coalition talks continue</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,436743,00.html\">12.02.01: Labour reels as coalition talks split Israeli left</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,435647,00.html\">09.02.01: The man of blood</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,435212,00.html\">08.02.01: What now?</a> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/elsewhere/journalist/story/0,7792,434747,00.html\">07.02.01, World dispatch: Sharon has a mountain to climb</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,434707,00.html\">07.02.01: World offers Sharon a wary welcome</a> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/graphic/0,5812,434653,00.html\">Election results</a></p> <p><b>Interactive guide</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/wto/flash/0,6189,380127,00.html\">An interactive history of Israel</a></p> <p><b>Video</b><br> <a href=\"  http://play.rbn.com/?url=ap/nynyt/g2demand/0206israel_sharon.rm&amp;proto=dual\" target=\"_new\">Ariel Sharon's victory speech, from the New York Times</a></p> <p><b>Key players</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,433318,00.html\">Ariel Sharon: from butcher to 'Lion' to Prime Minister of Israel</a><br> <a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,378609,00.html\">Ehud Barak: the main loser</a><br> <a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,381921,00.html\" target=\"_new\">Supreme test for 'Mr Palestine'</a></p> <p><b>From the Guardian archive</b><br> <a href=\"  http://guardiancentury.co.uk/1940-1949/Story/0,6051,105109,00.html\" target=\"_new\">15.05.1948: Jewish state is born</a><br> <a href=\"  http://guardiancentury.co.uk/1940-1949/Story/0,6051,105125,00.html\" target=\"_new\">19.11.1948, Arthur Koestler: Israel's the new generation</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.info.gov.il/eng/min-pmo.htm\" target=\"_new\">Office of the Israeli Prime Minister</a><br> <a href=\"  http://www.israel-mfa.gov.il/mfa/go.asp?MFAH00pq0\" target=\"_new\">Peace process: reference documents in full</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.knesset.gov.il/knesset\" target=\"_new\">Israeli Knesset</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.4321.co.il/no\" target=\"_new\">Email Barak, Sharon and Arafat</a><br> <a href=\"  http://www.jpost.com/\" target=\"_new\">Jerusalem Post</a><br> <a href=\"  http://www.ptimes.com/\" target=\"_new\">Palestine Times</a></p>",

In this scenario, even if a Palestinian state would not turn its sights on Israel, it could very well threaten Jordan in the hope of linking up with Iraq - a natural Palestinian ally - and create a huge, expansive, terror-sponsoring state on the border of Saudi Arabia.\" This is a prospect that would obviously concern the US and Europe and which will be raised by Sharon representatives in their forays abroad.\" The Tel Aviv daily, Ha'aretz, helpfully provides an English translation of leading articles in the Palestinian papers. They cannot make comfortable reading for Israelis. Al Hayat al-Jadida, for example, warns the incoming prime minister: \"We are willing to stand up to anyone wishing to do us harm. We are prepared to negotiate fairly, if he shows genuine desire to negotiate a fair and comprehensive solution of peace. We do not expect Sharon to be merciful toward our children, trees and land. Occupation knows no mercy. But we will remain on our land, we will defend ourselves and continue to fight for our legitimate rights. Sooner or later, justice will be done.\" Al Ayyam asks whether the Israeli voters realised what they were doing in the February 6 election, but has no doubt about the outcome: \"The Israelis are offering us another round of conflict, which may be the most difficult yet. We and the Israelis will suffer much before the Israeli voters realise - on their next trip to the polls, perhaps in a few months - that peace and security can only be achieved by following one path, and that this path certainly does not run by Sharon's door.\" Ha'aretz commentator Yoel Marcus notes that Sharon is radiating the same aura of restraint and moderation that featured in his election campaign. Marcus asks, pertinently: \"If we aren't witnessing the miracle of the leopard changing its spots, there's still the question of how exactly he will bring peace without removing a single settlement, without dividing Jerusalem and leaving 42% of the territories in Palestinian hands. That he's got something up his sleeve is certain. The riddle is: When will the real Sharon come out of the closet?\" Related stories 13.02.01: Israel kills 'militant' as coalition talks continue 12.02.01: Labour reels as coalition talks split Israeli left 09.02.01: The man of blood 08.02.01: What now? 07.02.01, World dispatch: Sharon has a mountain to climb 07.02.01: World offers Sharon a wary welcome Election results Interactive guide An interactive history of Israel Video Ariel Sharon's victory speech, from the New York Times Key players Ariel Sharon: from butcher to 'Lion' to Prime Minister of Israel Ehud Barak: the main loser Supreme test for 'Mr Palestine' From the Guardian archive 15.05.1948: Jewish state is born 19.11.1948, Arthur Koestler: Israel's the new generation Useful links Office of the Israeli Prime Minister Peace process: reference documents in full Israeli Knesset Email Barak, Sharon and Arafat Jerusalem Post Palestine Times",

It was the system of cradle-to-grave provision set up after the second world war following the publication of the Beveridge report. Less well known is the welfare state for companies, the system whereby large dollops of public money are handed out by the department of trade and industry to big corporations. Sometimes these hand-outs are to foreign companies that say that they will invest in Britain providing the government offers them the right fiscal package - tax breaks, a greenfield site for nothing, a straight cash payment. Sometimes as in the case of today's \u00a3250 million subsidy to Rolls-Royce the money goes to domestic companies in order to safeguard jobs. In political terms, it is not hard to see why the trade and industry secretary, Stephen Byers, has dipped into the government's coffers. After the recent announcement by steel company Corus that it was planning major job losses, Labour needs to be seen supporting manufacturing industry. In case anybody hadn't noticed, there's an election coming up. There is also a good, solid economic case for the government backing Rolls-Royce, which is one of the world leaders in air engine production, in the development of the Trent 900 and the Trent 600. Britain has precious few companies that could justly be classified as world class: Rolls-Royce is one of them.

And then came Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, with its combination of eastern philosophy and fighting, and western dramatic gravity. This, it was hoped, would be the film to crack the formula. The director said he wanted something that would be \"like a summer blockbuster in Asia but an arthouse film in the rest of the world\". But, if anything, the reverse has been true. </p> <p>Having conquered film festivals across Europe and north America, Crouching Tiger has taken less than three weeks to become the UK's highest grossing foreign-language film of all time. In the US, it has also performed spectacularly (US$53m and rising). It recently received two Golden Globes, and is among this year's Oscar favourites. </p> <p>Back on home territory, however, the reaction has been decidedly mixed. The film has scored well in Singapore and Taiwan but, in Korea and Japan, it has been outshone by domestic and Hollywood competition. In Hong Kong, despite critical acclaim, the film has taken HK$15.8m (\u00a31.45m) since July, including a recent re-release. By way of comparison Jackie Chan's latest, Accidental Spy, has racked up almost twice as much in Hong Kong in its first three weeks. </p> <p>\"For Hong Kong Chinese there's simply not enough action,\" says Maria Wong, a post-production film executive in Hong Kong. \"I grew up with this type of film. You can see them every day on TV. It's nothing new, even the female angle. But Crouching Tiger is so slow, it's a bit like listening to grandma telling stories.\" </p> <p>For Hong Kong and Chinese audiences, the historical martial arts (or \"wire-fu\") genre is exemplified by 1980s films such as Ronnie Yu's The Bride With White Hair or Tsui Hark's Zu Warriors from the Magic Mountain and his Once Upon a Time in China series. The fight scenes are usually longer, more frequent and more technically skilled (Michelle Yeoh was the only real martial arts expert in Crouching Tiger). </p> <p>Further, any intervals between fights are filled either with slapstick comedy or rapid-fire exposition, so as to cram in the extravagantly complex plotlines. Crouching Tiger's static drama was exacerbated for audiences in Hong Kong by seeing their Cantonese-speaking heroes, Chow Yun-Fat and Malaysian-born Michelle Yeoh, struggling with Mandarin prose. </p> <p>In mainland China, where the film was shot, receipts have also been low, estimated at US$1.5m, though its performance may have been affected by Lee's Taiwanese nationality. Given China's strained relationship with the renegade republic, the mainland authorities are unlikely to have taken to the film. It was, in effect, off the market for three and a half months because of a dispute between producers, during which time millions of pirated DVDs of the film are said to have flooded the market, killing off subsequent demand. </p> <p>James Schamus, Crouching Tiger's co-writer and executive producer, is quick to defend it: \"It was the highest grossing Chinese-language film in virtually every Asian territory; even if it hadn't been released in the west, it would have been a huge success. It didn't do well in some places, but who's complaining? Not me!\" </p> <p>Schamus also dismisses as \"western xenophobia\" recent accusations that director Lee has tailored his \"Chineseness\" for western audiences, to deliver \"cleverly packaged chop suey\". Elements of the film were undoubtedly selected with western appeal in mind, however: cast members with international recognition; a score by cellist Yo-Yo Ma, well known in western classical circles; fight sequences by Yuen Wo-Ping, who now carries the suffix \"of Matrix fame\". Most importantly, the screenplay was in continual ping-pong between James Schamus and two Chinese scriptwriters, teasing out cross-cultural resonances from the source text: the fourth episode of Du Lang Wang's historical fable. </p> <p>So Lee didn't quite crack the global formula, but he is not the first Chinese auteur to be feted in the west and ignored at home. Wong Kar-Wai, for example, has triumphed on western arthouse and film festival circuits with meditative urban tales such as last year's In the Mood for Love, but his films have only been minor hits in Hong Kong itself. Likewise with mainland stars such as Zhang Yimou (Raise the Red Lantern), Chen Kaige (Farewell My Concubine) and their successors. Frequently they have been forced to smuggle their films out of China for the benefit of appreciative western audiences. </p> <p>For a film to conquer all corners of the world, it would have to be the cinematic equivalent of McDonald's: a big, bland, undemanding work of the type Lee will hopefully never produce. Films that succeed globally are usually out-and-out Hollywood epics such as Titanic or Mission: Impossible 2. From the Asian side, only Jackie Chan has that world-beating potential. </p> <p>Even so, Crouching Tiger has, it is hoped, improved both sides of the equation. Western filmgoers might be tempted to delve further into the wire-fu genre - where works by Tsui Hark, King Hu, Chang Cheh among others await - and Chinese film-makers might be encouraged to return to it. The genre has all but dried up since Hollywood began tempting away its best exponents, most of whom had acquired cult status in the west with their home-made efforts, but whose US-made films have been dull. Hark, for instance, produced the indifferent Jean-Claude van Damme vehicle Knock Out in the US, but is now back in Hong Kong working on a sequel to 1983's Zu Warriors. He is reportedly trying to push the boundaries of the genre even further, in response to the success of Crouching Tiger. Given the west's new love affair with the genre, the film could even secure a theatrical release in the US or the UK, something Hong Kong action directors could never have dreamed of before.</p>",

James Schamus, Crouching Tiger's co-writer and executive producer, is quick to defend it: \"It was the highest grossing Chinese-language film in virtually every Asian territory; even if it hadn't been released in the west, it would have been a huge success. It didn't do well in some places, but who's complaining? Not me!\" Schamus also dismisses as \"western xenophobia\" recent accusations that director Lee has tailored his \"Chineseness\" for western audiences, to deliver \"cleverly packaged chop suey\". Elements of the film were undoubtedly selected with western appeal in mind, however: cast members with international recognition; a score by cellist Yo-Yo Ma, well known in western classical circles; fight sequences by Yuen Wo-Ping, who now carries the suffix \"of Matrix fame\". Most importantly, the screenplay was in continual ping-pong between James Schamus and two Chinese scriptwriters, teasing out cross-cultural resonances from the source text: the fourth episode of Du Lang Wang's historical fable. So Lee didn't quite crack the global formula, but he is not the first Chinese auteur to be feted in the west and ignored at home. Wong Kar-Wai, for example, has triumphed on western arthouse and film festival circuits with meditative urban tales such as last year's In the Mood for Love, but his films have only been minor hits in Hong Kong itself. Likewise with mainland stars such as Zhang Yimou (Raise the Red Lantern), Chen Kaige (Farewell My Concubine) and their successors. Frequently they have been forced to smuggle their films out of China for the benefit of appreciative western audiences. For a film to conquer all corners of the world, it would have to be the cinematic equivalent of McDonald's: a big, bland, undemanding work of the type Lee will hopefully never produce. Films that succeed globally are usually out-and-out Hollywood epics such as Titanic or Mission: Impossible 2. From the Asian side, only Jackie Chan has that world-beating potential. Even so, Crouching Tiger has, it is hoped, improved both sides of the equation. Western filmgoers might be tempted to delve further into the wire-fu genre - where works by Tsui Hark, King Hu, Chang Cheh among others await - and Chinese film-makers might be encouraged to return to it. The genre has all but dried up since Hollywood began tempting away its best exponents, most of whom had acquired cult status in the west with their home-made efforts, but whose US-made films have been dull. Hark, for instance, produced the indifferent Jean-Claude van Damme vehicle Knock Out in the US, but is now back in Hong Kong working on a sequel to 1983's Zu Warriors. He is reportedly trying to push the boundaries of the genre even further, in response to the success of Crouching Tiger. Given the west's new love affair with the genre, the film could even secure a theatrical release in the US or the UK, something Hong Kong action directors could never have dreamed of before.",

      "bodyText": "Havas Advertising, which owns three UK agencies, has announced an impressive 48.6% rise in turnover for 2000 to \u00a37.65bn. The company - the parent of WCRS, Euro RSCG Wnek Gosper and Partners BDDH - is now the fourth biggest global ad group. It said it had won \u00a32.36bn of new business last year. Havas's strongest growth region is believed to be Latin America, currently expanding by around 23% a year, with north America suffering a slowdown in growth. The UK market remains healthier. The jump in turnover does not include Havas's \u00a31.4bn acquisition of US advertising group Snyder Communications last February. The group's share price remained stable at \u00a310.16 following the turnover announcement. Havas will publish full 2000 results on March 1. These will detail the billings added by the Snyder acquisition and give a further indication of the threat that Havas poses to the world's leading ad groups WPP, Omnicom and Interpublic. French-based Euro RSCG is Havas's biggest network. It also owns Arnold Communications, which includes the WCRS and BDDH advertising brands. Media, direct marketing and internet interests include the Diversified Agencies Group, Media Planning Group and Circle.com. Havas agencies produce advertising for clients including Bass Brewers, BMW, Mercedes Benz and the Co-Op.",

      "bodyText": "The chancellor, Gordon Brown, last night told the European commission that Labour's plans for higher public spending were non-negotiable after criticism by Brussels was seized upon by UK opponents of monetary union as fresh evidence of the dangers of joining the euro. With the start of an election campaign weeks away, Mr Brown sought to defuse claims by Eurosceptics that joining monetary union would involve Brussels-inspired spending cuts by telling the commission that he would press on with his expenditure proposals. The chancellor, determined that the euro should be sidelined as an issue on polling day, reacted with irritation to the criticism from Brussels, which said it was worried by the planned dip into the red in the government's finances caused by higher spending. \"I made it absolutely clear that our plans for spending are prudent. The European commission has in my view taken too narrow a view of investment,\" Mr Brown said. He singled out improvements to Britain's crumbling transport infrastructure as a particular priority and said billions of pounds were at stake since his plan was to more than double capital spending by 2004. \"This increase in frontline public spending is essential and it is in our national economic interest that it proceeds as planned. Our plans are de signed to reverse years of under investment. It is the right thing to do for the British economy and society.\" William Hague's team immediately accused the European commission of trying to dictate to London in defiance of the \"commonsense [instinct] that we should retain our ability to govern ourselves.\" The Conservatives were provided with extra ammunition when Ireland - the fastest growing country in the EU became the first country to be reprimanded by European finance ministers over the conduct of its fiscal policy. The Business for Sterling group said: \"The action taken against Ireland and the moves towards greater powers for the euro-11 group show how the euro is driving institutional change and how joining the euro necessarily involves losing control of budgetary policy.\" Some MPs saw Mr Brown's approach as a deliberate as sertion of his own authority over British euro-policy.

(It was the medium of instruction in his department.) Lalzad concedes that Pakistanis do try to enter the UK by claiming to be Afghan refugees, and is sure he would have been deported had he not produced his Red Cross identity card. </p> <p>Then came a frustrating wait while his application for asylum was considered (it took 18 months) and he tried to get work. \"I felt ashamed sitting at home. It is a morally bad way of living for someone with education and knowledge not to work.\" Letters to universities produced no result, though he was encouraged by a short course at the University of North London, where he made contacts.

He is working on a way of using solar power to desalinate water cheaply - potentially a vast boon to his native Afghanistan and a swathe of countries across Asia, the Middle East and Africa which suffer from water shortages but no lack of sunshine. But as he talks at his bench at South Bank University in London his eyes betray deep anxiety and sadness. There is sadness for the wreck of his country under a regime which has driven him out and destroyed the university he was proud of. But uppermost in his mind is whether his wife and their five children will be allowed to join him after more than two years apart. They were being interviewed in Pakistan that day by the British High Commission about a visa. \"My mind is not here,\" he apologises.

Most have had their genetic code changed so they will be resistant to herbicides or viruses.</p> <p>Labels are not required under Canadian law, so consumers buying, say, cornflakes have no way of knowing if they are purchasing a GM product, unless they buy an organic brand.</p> <p>So far, the experiment hasn't appeared to hurt anyone, the report says, but that could change as more complex varieties of GM food come on the market.</p> <p>\"There are significant risks associated with these new technologies. There are risks of new toxins and allergenic proteins introduced into genetically modified foods,\" said Conrad Brunk, co-chair of an expert panel that was set up to review Canada's GM food regulatory system.</p> <p>He and other panel members were asked by the federal government to assess its regulatory approach to GM foods. The health ministry appointed the panel as a way to build public confidence.</p> <p>Instead, the government got a stinging rebuke.</p> <p>The panel said that regulators often used \"unsubstantiated assumptions\" when it approved GM foods and did not have a standard and clear procedure for determining the safety of foods that many British and European consumers refuse to buy.</p> <p>They said researchers in Canada who wish to do work that may hurt the GM food industry cannot get funding.</p> <p>The panel members also criticised the government for being secretive and far too close to the biotechnology industry, noting that the government agency responsible for protecting human health is also responsible for promoting the new food products - a conflict of interest that cannot be good for the health of Canadians.</p> <p>Environmental groups are hoping these kinds of findings will be a wake-up call for shoppers. For now, however, there is little sign of public outrage.

      "bodyText": "The news that Canadians are being used as guinea pigs to test genetically modified foods may have had politicians scrambling for a day or two but seems unlikely to change any local eating habits. The report, from a panel of top scientists, was front-page news across the country last week, yet Canadians are likely to continue to complacently munch away on government-approved GM products - either because they don't know what they are eating or they simply don't care. The waves of concern over GM foods that have swamped politicians in Europe are mere ripples in Canada, felt more by farmers who grow GM crops than the elected officials who pushed them to market. More than 40 types of GM crops have been quietly approved over the past five years, including strains of corn, soy and potatoes. Most have had their genetic code changed so they will be resistant to herbicides or viruses. Labels are not required under Canadian law, so consumers buying, say, cornflakes have no way of knowing if they are purchasing a GM product, unless they buy an organic brand. So far, the experiment hasn't appeared to hurt anyone, the report says, but that could change as more complex varieties of GM food come on the market. \"There are significant risks associated with these new technologies. There are risks of new toxins and allergenic proteins introduced into genetically modified foods,\" said Conrad Brunk, co-chair of an expert panel that was set up to review Canada's GM food regulatory system. He and other panel members were asked by the federal government to assess its regulatory approach to GM foods. The health ministry appointed the panel as a way to build public confidence. Instead, the government got a stinging rebuke. The panel said that regulators often used \"unsubstantiated assumptions\" when it approved GM foods and did not have a standard and clear procedure for determining the safety of foods that many British and European consumers refuse to buy. They said researchers in Canada who wish to do work that may hurt the GM food industry cannot get funding. The panel members also criticised the government for being secretive and far too close to the biotechnology industry, noting that the government agency responsible for protecting human health is also responsible for promoting the new food products - a conflict of interest that cannot be good for the health of Canadians. Environmental groups are hoping these kinds of findings will be a wake-up call for shoppers. For now, however, there is little sign of public outrage. While the debacle over mad cow disease has left British consumers with little faith that the government will protect them from dangerous food products, Canadians are still trusting of their leaders Environmental groups are calling for an immediate moratorium on GM products, but the government has rejected the idea. This is, in part, because it has invested heavily in GM foods. Government labs have done some of the pioneering working transferring genes from one species to another. Government programs have encouraged farmers to switch to GM crops. Even though it was the health ministry that hired the scientists to sit on the panel, government officials began an immediate counter-offensive when the report was released, publicly criticising its findings. They said the scientists didn't know what they were talking about when they concluded the system is flawed. \"Canada needs to remain on the leading edge of the new scientific developments,\" said Agriculture Minister Lyle Vanclief. So for now, at least until there are signs the experiment is backfiring, sanguine Canadian guinea pigs will continue to munch on GM foods.",

      "bodyText": "The time taken up by soaps on BBC1 and ITV in peaktime has increased by 150% over the past 25 years, according to Independent Television Commission research. The amount of non-soap peaktime drama on BBC1 has halved over the same period. The research, carried out by David Graham Associates, focuses on how programming diversity on public-service networks has changed since 1975. BBC1 drama other than soaps accounted for just 11% of the peaktime schedule in November last year. In contrast, non-soap drama takes up more than a quarter of ITV's peaktime schedule. Almost all of this is home-grown, unlike 25 years ago when much was imported from the US. ITC chief executive Patricia Hodgson revealed the statistics last night while delivering the ITN European Media Forum Lecture. She contrasted the surge in soaps across BBC1 and ITV channels with the virtual disappearance of films from the broadcasters' peaktime schedules. On BBC1 there has been a steady increase of hobby and leisure programmes, quiz shows and features. These have risen from around 3% of peaktime output in the 1970s to 27% by last November. Ms Hodgson singled out BBC2 and Channel 4 for \"performing well\" in terms of programming diversity. \"Tastes change but there's a consistant spread of seven to eight genres making up most of the schedule in peaktime over the period,\" she said. \"By contrast, BBC1 and ITV, in particular, tend to consolidate their peaktime schedules around a few genres.\" The David Graham Associates research analysed programming schedules for November in 1975, 1985, 1995 and 2000.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>All manner of fears can dissuade people from applying for a job: a lack of self-confidence, for example, or concerns about fitting in with their future colleagues. My friend's joke that she \"could never work at French Connection because my hair is too frizzy\" is perhaps less common, but no longer does it seem whimsical. Style is now more important than substance - or at least, more important than skills. </p> <p>That is the message of a report published this month which questions the image employees project and how it compares to the one your would-be employer wants to promote. According to Looking Good, Sounding Right by Chris Warhurst and Dennis Nickson, it is now more important to employers that their employees reflect the lifestyle being sold by the restaurant, cafe or shop in which they work than that they have any technical skills. Job notices often resemble lonely hearts adverts in their bids for \"young\", \"stylish\", \"attractive\" or \"trendy\" applicants. The ideal employee, it would appear, closely resembles a cast member of Hollyoaks. </p> <p>The idea that workers create the image of a company has long been an accepted part of management-level jobs. Brett Easton Ellis, brutally satirised it in his novel, American Psycho. But now this concept has filtered down to entry-level jobs, such as shop assistants and waiters. According to Warhurst and Dickson, employers now rely more on appearance and accent (apparently, you should rid yourself of that Brummie or Scouse accent now) than on qualifications. </p> <p>So is getting a job all a matter of style? At coffee house chain, Caffe Nero, the answer would seem to be yes. \"It is definitely more important that the employees reflect what Caffe Nero stands for than that they have experience,\" says Jerry Ford, chairman of Caffe Nero. \"We want someone who reflects the Caffe Nero brand, and it's much easier to train someone how to make a cup of coffee than to revamp their personalities.\" </p> <p>Such statements put a new spin on the idea of the objectification of employees. It is not that workers are seen as mere commodities for the business, but they are expected to be walking billboards for it. No longer is it sufficient to have the name of the cafe or store plastered across your T-shirt or baseball cap; it must also be exuded by your whole being. As Rachel Hall, creative and PR Manager of the womens' clothing store Morgan, says simply, \"We like [our employees] to reflect the Morgan image so the customer has a complete feel for the brand.\" Ford agrees: \"What we are selling to the customer is a whole service, not just a cup of coffee.\" </p> <p>So if you are applying to work as a barista in a coffee house, ascertain beforehand the style of the company. One might promote the \"young, dynamic, probably-work-for-a-successful-dot.com\" experience, another might pitch itself more as a \"sexy, continental, cultured\" place. Caffe Nero, for example, likes to have Italian employees because \"it is an Italian coffee house\", Ford explains (although it is registered in the UK). </p> <p>This desire in the commercial sector to create a solid, established identity reflects the rise of the chain store. Most high streets in this country now closely resemble one another: there is always a River Island, a Gap, a Caf\u00e9 Rouge on the horizon. Familiarity, these stores seem to think, breeds contentment in the consumer, and financial benefits for the companies, so they ensure that every one of their outlets is exactly the same, such as Pret a Manger's distinctive silver floors and The Gap's universally perky and eager floorstaff. It's not enough that every branch should look the same - they must all feel the same, too. Simultaneously, they use this established identity to help the consumer differentiate between them and another company. </p> <p>\"All of these companies need to define themselves by creating an image,\" says Warhurst, \"and they look for employees to personify that image.\" There is something distinctly New Labour-ish about the idea that image is more important than service. This, after all, is the party that has made celebrities out of its image makers and spin-doctors. So if it worked for the most popular Labour government we've had in the past 100 years, why shouldn't Caffe Nero and the rest of them New Labourise, or at least, Philip Gouldise, themselves? </p> <p>The most worrying aspect of this trend is the discrimination it entails against the long-term unemployed and others who might not be as \"sexy and trendy\", to quote one employment notice, as young British (or Italian) students. And heaven forbid that you should be served by someone in a chain coffee house with a grating regional accent. That would surely jolt you into the realisation that your coffee was being made by someone from Manchester instead of Milan, and wouldn't that be a turn-off? </p> <p>\"Unemployment levels are staying the same in many areas, such as the east end of Glasgow, despite the fact that the service industry is growing so rapidly,\" says Warhurst. \"This is because the long-term unemployed who live in the area are being overlooked in favour of middle-class kids from the surrounding suburbs who have more cultural capital.\" </p> <p>This is not a matter of restaurants not hiring people with poor personal hygiene, or other such understandable objections; Warhurst and Dickson cite incredibly unfair examples of employee discrimination, such as one woman who was sent home and told to shave her legs. \"There are now employers who are clearly discriminating against people who aren't unskilled or unqualified, but who just don't fit the company's package,\" says Max Nathan from the Industrial Society. \"Certainly you can have a brand image,\" Nathan concedes, \"but that can't involve unfair discrimination.\" </p> <p>But herein lies the problem, because that is exactly what creating an image means - promoting certain qualities at the expense of others. In this case, these qualities happen to be employees, and this is the inevitable result when capitalism meets the concept of selling a lifestyle in a coffee cup. Britain in the 21st century is pretty used to the idea of image-making. From the government to the Post Office we have seen big corporations rename and re-logo themselves, but perhaps we are not quite ready for the coldly pragmatic measures such moves require, nor for the accompanying cold business-speak. </p> <p>When The Wise Group ran a course in 1999 training the long-term unemployed to project a more positive lifestyle (or \"an aesthetic skills training programme\"), the press seized on it scornfully and the course was quickly dropped after a week. Such haste suggests a tacit awareness that this emphasis on style still leaves a bad taste in many people's mouths. But more importantly, and more obviously, when it comes to places like cafes and restaurants, the customer wants to be served, simple as that. If the takeaway latte you bought was watery and the service was slow, it is unlikely you'll go back there, no matter how young, stylish and Italian the barista was.</p>",

      "bodyText": "All manner of fears can dissuade people from applying for a job: a lack of self-confidence, for example, or concerns about fitting in with their future colleagues. My friend's joke that she \"could never work at French Connection because my hair is too frizzy\" is perhaps less common, but no longer does it seem whimsical. Style is now more important than substance - or at least, more important than skills. That is the message of a report published this month which questions the image employees project and how it compares to the one your would-be employer wants to promote. According to Looking Good, Sounding Right by Chris Warhurst and Dennis Nickson, it is now more important to employers that their employees reflect the lifestyle being sold by the restaurant, cafe or shop in which they work than that they have any technical skills. Job notices often resemble lonely hearts adverts in their bids for \"young\", \"stylish\", \"attractive\" or \"trendy\" applicants. The ideal employee, it would appear, closely resembles a cast member of Hollyoaks. The idea that workers create the image of a company has long been an accepted part of management-level jobs. Brett Easton Ellis, brutally satirised it in his novel, American Psycho. But now this concept has filtered down to entry-level jobs, such as shop assistants and waiters. According to Warhurst and Dickson, employers now rely more on appearance and accent (apparently, you should rid yourself of that Brummie or Scouse accent now) than on qualifications. So is getting a job all a matter of style? At coffee house chain, Caffe Nero, the answer would seem to be yes. \"It is definitely more important that the employees reflect what Caffe Nero stands for than that they have experience,\" says Jerry Ford, chairman of Caffe Nero. \"We want someone who reflects the Caffe Nero brand, and it's much easier to train someone how to make a cup of coffee than to revamp their personalities.\" Such statements put a new spin on the idea of the objectification of employees. It is not that workers are seen as mere commodities for the business, but they are expected to be walking billboards for it. No longer is it sufficient to have the name of the cafe or store plastered across your T-shirt or baseball cap; it must also be exuded by your whole being. As Rachel Hall, creative and PR Manager of the womens' clothing store Morgan, says simply, \"We like [our employees] to reflect the Morgan image so the customer has a complete feel for the brand.\" Ford agrees: \"What we are selling to the customer is a whole service, not just a cup of coffee.\" So if you are applying to work as a barista in a coffee house, ascertain beforehand the style of the company. One might promote the \"young, dynamic, probably-work-for-a-successful-dot.com\" experience, another might pitch itself more as a \"sexy, continental, cultured\" place. Caffe Nero, for example, likes to have Italian employees because \"it is an Italian coffee house\", Ford explains (although it is registered in the UK). This desire in the commercial sector to create a solid, established identity reflects the rise of the chain store. Most high streets in this country now closely resemble one another: there is always a River Island, a Gap, a Caf\u00e9 Rouge on the horizon. Familiarity, these stores seem to think, breeds contentment in the consumer, and financial benefits for the companies, so they ensure that every one of their outlets is exactly the same, such as Pret a Manger's distinctive silver floors and The Gap's universally perky and eager floorstaff. It's not enough that every branch should look the same - they must all feel the same, too. Simultaneously, they use this established identity to help the consumer differentiate between them and another company. \"All of these companies need to define themselves by creating an image,\" says Warhurst, \"and they look for employees to personify that image.\" There is something distinctly New Labour-ish about the idea that image is more important than service. This, after all, is the party that has made celebrities out of its image makers and spin-doctors. So if it worked for the most popular Labour government we've had in the past 100 years, why shouldn't Caffe Nero and the rest of them New Labourise, or at least, Philip Gouldise, themselves? The most worrying aspect of this trend is the discrimination it entails against the long-term unemployed and others who might not be as \"sexy and trendy\", to quote one employment notice, as young British (or Italian) students. And heaven forbid that you should be served by someone in a chain coffee house with a grating regional accent. That would surely jolt you into the realisation that your coffee was being made by someone from Manchester instead of Milan, and wouldn't that be a turn-off? \"Unemployment levels are staying the same in many areas, such as the east end of Glasgow, despite the fact that the service industry is growing so rapidly,\" says Warhurst. \"This is because the long-term unemployed who live in the area are being overlooked in favour of middle-class kids from the surrounding suburbs who have more cultural capital.\" This is not a matter of restaurants not hiring people with poor personal hygiene, or other such understandable objections; Warhurst and Dickson cite incredibly unfair examples of employee discrimination, such as one woman who was sent home and told to shave her legs. \"There are now employers who are clearly discriminating against people who aren't unskilled or unqualified, but who just don't fit the company's package,\" says Max Nathan from the Industrial Society. \"Certainly you can have a brand image,\" Nathan concedes, \"but that can't involve unfair discrimination.\" But herein lies the problem, because that is exactly what creating an image means - promoting certain qualities at the expense of others. In this case, these qualities happen to be employees, and this is the inevitable result when capitalism meets the concept of selling a lifestyle in a coffee cup. Britain in the 21st century is pretty used to the idea of image-making. From the government to the Post Office we have seen big corporations rename and re-logo themselves, but perhaps we are not quite ready for the coldly pragmatic measures such moves require, nor for the accompanying cold business-speak. When The Wise Group ran a course in 1999 training the long-term unemployed to project a more positive lifestyle (or \"an aesthetic skills training programme\"), the press seized on it scornfully and the course was quickly dropped after a week. Such haste suggests a tacit awareness that this emphasis on style still leaves a bad taste in many people's mouths. But more importantly, and more obviously, when it comes to places like cafes and restaurants, the customer wants to be served, simple as that. If the takeaway latte you bought was watery and the service was slow, it is unlikely you'll go back there, no matter how young, stylish and Italian the barista was.",

The real Adam Gibson, his character in DNA thriller The 6th Day, nabbed a Worst Actor nomination, with the clone Gibson securing its place in the run-in for Worst Supporting Actor. The pair also wound up in the Worst Couple line-up. Long-time Razzies whipping thesps Madonna and Sylvester Stallone picked up nominations for their performances in The Next Best Thing and Get Carter respectively. While the bulk of the nominations were restricted to box-office drop-outs, two of last year's biggest hits, The Grinch and Mission: Impossible 2, broke this hegemony of failure and received two nominations apiece.

Philip Morris chief executive Geoffrey C Bible told German magazine Focusi that the company would continue with only low-key sponsorships after 2002 to release funds for fighting heavy compensation claims around the world. The news is a blow to Ferrari, which Marlboro has bankrolled for 30 years. The money helps pay Schumacher's \u00a320m annual salary. Neither company was available for comment. Under the EC clampdown on tobacco advertising, Philip Morris can continue to plaster the red and white Marlboro livery on cars and drivers until 2006, but the company could now end its sponsorship by the close of next season. Philip Morris is concerned about the growing compensation claims from former smokers particularly in the US. Some lawsuits have succeeded in winning large sums over smoking-related deaths, illnesses and associated costs.

      "bodyText": "The BBC has appointed a senior editor from News 24 to the top job at its revamped BBC1 Breakfast programme. Richard Porter, 37, takes over from Andrew Thompson, who left to join the BBC sports department shortly after last October's relaunch of Breakfast. Ratings for the new programme, broadcast simultaneously on BBC1 and News 24, went up from 800,000 to 1m. But it has not been a critical success. The pairing of former foreign correspondent Jeremy Bowen and Breakfast News presenter Sophie Raworth has not been the \"dream team\" that BBC news executives had hoped for. The appointment of Mr Porter came as a surprise to news staff, as his name had not previously been linked with the job. His background is in the BBC regions and executives believe he can bring a non-metropolitan outlook to the programme. \"Richard has played a big role in making BBC News 24 the success it now is,\" said BBC head of television news Roger Mosey. \"He has really sharp news judgement and his brief will be to build on Breakfast's reputation as the best early morning news service in British television.\"",

The grounds, in the courtyard of St Giles's church, Covent Garden, are a haven for drug addicts who hide in the bushes to shoot up. </p> <p>It was here that 12-year-old Diego Piniero-Villar befriended Edward Alexander Crowley, a drifter four times his age, nearly two years ago. </p> <p>According to Diego's mother, her son took pity on Crowley, 52, when other children started throwing stones at him. It was a kindness that cost him his life. </p> <p>Diego could not have known the scruffy man carrying a plastic bag had a long history of mental illness and that he had developed an obsession with the occult. </p> <p>Crowley's and Diego's relationship started with conversations by the swings and trips to play games at a local arcade, and were followed with visits to the swimming baths. Crowley bought Diego gifts and treats such as hamburgers, and for a while the schoolboy seemed flattered by the attention. </p> <p>Police have never found any evidence that Crowley abused Diego, but the relationship was uncomfortably physical; it involved play-fights in which Crowley licked his ear and tickled his navel. </p> <p>Diego appears to have kept their friendship a secret until the summer of 1999, when his mother became suspicious and contacted police. Officers were already on the case. Crowley had come to their attention in June that year, when residents reported seeing him approach children at Phoenix gardens. </p> <p>In September 1999, Crowley went to Holborn police station to confess he was having a relationship with a 12-year-old boy, which he described as \"loving but not primarily sexual\". He then retracted the claim. </p> <p>The subsequent investigation disturbed officers; a psychiatric nurse concluded Crowley was \"a definite risk to young boys\", and Diego's mother told them she had received calls from an anonymous man asking for her son. The boy, who by this time was unhappy with Crowley's attentions, was interviewed but gave no evidence of sexual abuse. </p> <p>When detectives went to Phoenix gardens, they found messages painted with correction fluid on the swing seats. \"I will always love you, Diego,\" stated one. \"Please forgive me for everything. I couldn't stand the pain. One day you'll know how much you hurt me. How much I need you.\" </p> <p>Another, dated November 2 1999, read: \"Always cheat others before they cheat you - if they are clever enough. I wasn't and I wouldn't want to be.\" </p> <p>It was addressed to \"Bravo, mi chico Latino\". </p> <p>Crowley was arrested on November 3 on suspicion of indecently assaulting Diego, but released almost immediately for lack of evidence. </p> <p>Crowley was not put off. On December 6, he went to Canada Blanch, the independent school Diego attended in west London, and painted in Spanish and English, this message across three doors. \"Why did you cheat me Diego? Why all the lies? I should hate you but I don't. Alex.\" </p> <p>He was arrested outside the school, and appeared before Marylebone magistrates the following day to plead guilty to causing criminal damage. He was given a two-year conditional discharge and released back on the streets. </p> <p>Diego was clearly at risk. He was given a police mobile phone, enabling him to dial 999. Patrols around the school were stepped up and his step-father Juan Fernandez began escorting him to west London. </p> <p>A few days later, Crowley was charged with harassment and remanded in custody by Highbury magistrates for mental health assessment. According to Camden council, a forensic psychiatrist who saw Crowley in prison concluded he was \"dangerous and should be detained\". </p> <p>On March 20, three and a half months after his arrest, the CPS went back to magistrates and admitted the case was not ready to go to crown court for trial. Despite the objections of the police, district judge Dorothy Quick granted Crowley bail on strict conditions. </p> <p>A charge of gross indecency was dropped a week later. </p> <p>Crowley was ordered not to contact Diego, attend the boy's home or school, or go to Phoenix gardens. He was also to report daily at a police station, though this was relaxed after two weeks. Neither the police nor social services knew where he was. Crowley was not on medication and he was not under supervision from social services. </p> <p>Mentally unstable and bearing a grudge that had festered in prison over 14 weeks, Crowley sought revenge. </p> <p>On the evening of May 7, Diego's stepfather asked Diego and his stepbrother Roberto, 15, to run an errand. </p> <p>As they passed Phoenix gardens at 8pm, they were confronted by Crowley, who was armed with a kitchen knife. He slashed the older boy, then turned on Diego, who managed to dial 999 on his mobile phone. The operator only heard his screams as he was stabbed more than 20 times. Diego was pronounced dead on arrival at St Thomas's hospital. </p> <p>After the murder, police began to unravel Crowley's past and his fascination with the occult. They discovered his name was not Crowley. He was born Henry Allen Bibby in Middlesbrough in 1948, and had spent most of his adult life jobless and drifting. His medical records showed he had tried to commit suicide by drugs overdose on at least seven occasions. </p> <p>His fascination with the occult can be traced from 1998, when he changed his name by deed poll to Edward Alexander Crowley, apparently in honour of the black arts magician Aleister Crowley, who styled himself \"the wickedest man alive\" and \"the Beast\".

      "body": "<p>Washington teems with a thousand industrial lobbyists. They cluster around the band of luxury offices and expensive restaurants which stretches from the White House to the Capitol building - a two-mile axis along which money and power are constantly traded. </p> <p>In this pantheon of corporate muscle, no industry wields as much power as the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association (PhRMA), a pressure group breathtaking for its deep pockets and aggression, even by the standards of US politics. </p> <p>There was a time not long ago when the corporate giants that PhRMA represents were merely the size of nations. Now, after a frenzied two-year period of pharmaceutical mega-mergers, they are behemoths which outweigh entire continents. </p> <p>The combined worth of the world's top five drug companies is twice the combined GDP of all sub-Saharan Africa and their influence on the rules of world trade is many times stronger because they can bring their wealth to bear directly on the levers of western power. </p> <p>In the struggle between western patent rights and the rest of the world's need for affordable medicine, the few concessions handed to the developing nations in the last year of the Clinton administration are likely to be reversed under Bush. The US government is expected to return to its customary role as a battering ram for the interests of the pharmaceutical industry and the principle of intellectual property. </p> <p>Until recently, the industry hedged its political bets, backing the Democrats and Republicans more or less evenly at election time. But at the last election, it gambled. With billions at stake in a heated debate over prescription drug prices at home and a growing number of patent disputes abroad, the drugmakers stacked their chips disproportionately behind George Bush. The industry spent nearly 70% of its unprecedented $24.4m campaign war chest on the Republicans. </p> <p>The wager paid off - just - and PhRMA has emerged at the apotheosis of its political clout, with grateful Republicans running the White House, Senate and House of Representatives. Politicians it has supported are now in key positions and it deploys 297 lobbyists - one for every two members of Congress. </p> <p><strong> 'Super profits'</strong><br> </p> <p>The pharmaceutical industry is therefore well-placed to defend profits which have soared in recent years to 36% (measured as a return on equity). That rate of return on investment is more than twice the US average. It is far and away the most profitable major industry in the country. </p> <p>These \"super-profits\" have been generated by the proliferation of new pharmaceutical discoveries and the parallel spread of worldwide patents. They are also a measure of PhRMA's success in using its influence in government to fight off the threat of domestic price caps and competition from generic manufacturers producing cheap copies of its drugs. </p> <p>The industry played a significant role in the drafting of Trips (trade related intellectual property rights) - that section of the World Trade Organisation's trade rules which relate to respect for patents. PhRMA has also made it a priority to ensure that the US government has enforced the Trips rules in a manner beneficial to its neighbours. </p> <p>In 1998, for example, it was revealed that Al Gore had bullied the South African government with threats of sanctions if it bought cheaper generic alternatives to brand-name Aids drugs, even though South Africa had the right to do so under Trips. </p> <p>The outcry over the vice-president's role, particularly among black Americans, led to one of the few setbacks the lobby has faced. In December 1999, Bill Clinton announced that the US trade representative (USTR), the country's chief negotiator and enforcer in trade disputes, would consult with the health department on the impact of intellectual property laws on access to essential medicines in the developing world. </p> <p>This may have been little more than lip service. The USTR continued to put pressure on Latin American countries to agree to patent laws. Its criticisms of Argentina and Brazil, on its \"watch list\" of patent miscreants, closely echo briefing documents supplied by PhRMA. </p> <p>The industry defends its hard-nosed approach by pointing to the cost of research and development (R&amp;D) and by the high risks involved in such a pioneering field. Jeff Trewitt, PhRMA's spokesman, said: \"Patents are the lifeblood to innovation. It costs about $500m to develop each pill and the arbitrary abrogation of patents is going to kill that off.\" </p> <p>While the past decade has undeniably been a period of extraordinary and vigorous innovation, the link between the development of new drugs and the industry's breathtaking profit margins is not necessarily as straightforward as PhRMA maintains. </p> <p><strong> Creative accounting</strong><br> </p> <p>Drug prices in Europe are about 60% of US prices, yet European firms spend a larger share of their revenues on R&amp;D than their American counterparts. The US companies spent more on marketing than on R&amp;D in 1999 (the last full year figures are available) and set aside more for profits. </p> <p>Moreover, with a little creative accounting, all manner of expenditures have been lodged under the R&amp;D title, partly in the pursuit of tax rebates. </p> <p>In fact, much of the R&amp;D work on new drugs is government-funded. A study by the Boston Globe newspaper in 1998 found the National Institutes of Health (NIH) laboratories spent $1bn on drug and vaccine development in the 1996 tax year, but only took in $27m in royalties. </p> <p>In September 1999, it was pointed out to the director of the NIH, Harold Varmus, that six HIV/Aids drugs, as well as anti-malarial treatments and other medicines of vital interest to developing countries, had been invented with public funds. The government therefore had the right under US law to use the drugs in public health initiatives. </p> <p>Dr Varmus dismissed the suggestion, echoing the industry line that: \"Undermining licensed intellectual property rights would, I believe, unnecessarily jeopardise the development of important therapeutic drugs.\" </p> <p>James Love, who runs a Washington-based group called the Consumer Project on Technology, sees the response as nonsensical because it was the NIH which did the hard work of discovering and synthesising the drugs in question. \"The rest of the world will have to go however many years more of paying an astronomical sum for something invented by the United States government,\" he said. \"How can we expect Glaxo to share its intellectual property if the United States government won't share its intellectual property to save millions of people. What does that say about the moral character of the American public. We are responsible.\" </p> <p>However, the real debate has arguably not been put before the American public with any clarity, because the extent to which the pharmaceutical industry in the US has been able to set the policy-making agenda remains invisible to the average voter. Ten years ago, its modest campaign contributions of $2.9m were evenly shared between the two parties and all in the form of \"hard money\" - federally regulated donations for use in a specific election campaign. </p> <p>In the 2000 election cycle, 60% of the drugmakers' $24.4m contributions were in the form of \"soft money\" - legal unregulated cash paid to the parties' national committees for supposedly general use. </p> <p>One of the biggest players in the soft money game is a group with the public-spirited title of Citizens for Better Medicare. For an organisation which commissioned an estimated $35m in advertising in the last election, Citizens for Better Medicare, maintains a remarkably small office in downtown Washington. </p> <p>\"We are a broad-based coalition of patients, doctors and the industry, which stands for a system based on competition, consumer empowerment and senior's choice,\" Tim Ryan, its executive director said. In terms of funding, however, he concedes the base is considerably narrower. </p> <p>\"We may have some contributions from individuals, but yes, we are largely funded by the industry. We haven't talked about figures, so I can't tell you the percentage,\" he said. </p> <p>The percentage is close to 100. Citizens for Better Medicare (CBM) was founded and is funded by PhRMA and the drug industry. When it registered itself for non-profit status, CBM declared itself as a PhRMA affiliate. Before taking up his executive director position, Mr Ryan was PhRMA's marketing director. </p> <p>CBM does not need a big staff or extensive premises because 98% of the money coming in from the industry is funnelled straight out to a single advertising producer, Alex Castellanos. Mr Castellanos's other main clients last year were the George Bush election campaign and the Republican National Committee. He was responsible for the most notorious advertisement of the 2000 election, in which the word Rats flashed subliminally on the screen during a discussion of Al Gore's healthcare proposals. </p> <p><strong> Key positions</strong><br> </p> <p>There are other examples of how the distinction between the interests of the pharmaceutical industry and the Bush presidency have blurred. There is a fast-spinning revolving door between government and the pharmaceutical industry. Mitch Daniels, the new director of the office of management and budget in the White House, was formerly the vice-president for strategy and policy at the pharmaceutical giant, Eli Lilly. Two members of the Bush transition team, Anne Marie Lynch and Bill Walters, are PhRMA members. Three others were seconded from big pharmaceutical firms. </p> <p>\"The PhRMA doesn't need to lobby,\" Democratic congressman Sherrod Brown said in a memo to staff last month. \"The industry is in the White House already.\" </p> <p>The industry has sympathetic politicians in key positions in Congress. Behind George Bush, the biggest recipient of pharmaceutical funding in the last election was Orrin Hatch, a conservative Republican from Utah, who chairs the Senate judiciary committee and is therefore well-placed to influence patent disputes. </p> <p>The industry backed Senator Hatch to the tune of $340,000 and provided a plane for him to travel about the country in his quixotic bid for the Republican presidential nomination last year. </p> <p>Tomorrow: Are western drug companies using the third world poor as guinea pigs for their drug trials? </p> <p><strong>Related articles</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/bush/story/0,7369,437340,00.html\">13.02.2001: The biggest players</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4134705,00.html\">12.02.2001, John Le Carr\u00e9: A lot of very greedy people</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Columnists/Column/0,5673,436838,00.html\">12.02.2001, Madeleine Bunting: The profits that kill</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Columnists/Column/0,5673,436639,00.html\">12.02.2001, Larry Elliott: Profits triumph in a sick society</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/aids/story/0,7369,436832,00.html\">12.02.2001: At the mercy of drug giants</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/aids/story/0,7369,405579,00.html\">The issue explained: Aids crisis</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/aids/story/0,7369,421922,00.html\">14.01.2001: Drugs giants sue to cut HIV lifeline</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/aids/story/0,7369,421923,00.html\">14.01.2001: South Africa fights Aids drug apartheid</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/aids/story/0,7369,420645,00.html\">11.01.2001: Nkosi's last stand</a> </p> <p> <strong>Related special reports</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/aids\">Aids</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/bush\">George Bush's America</a> </p> <p> <strong>Useful links</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.pfizer.com/main.html\">Pfizer</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.gsk.com/\">Glaxo SmithKline</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.astrazeneca.com/\">AstraZeneca</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.aventis.com/\">Aventis</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.novartis.com\">Novartis</a><br> &lt;A HREF=\"http://world.pharma.org\" TARGET=\"_new\"PhRMA information on drugs and developing world <a href=\"http://www.nih.gov\">US national institutes of health</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.cptech.org.ip/health\">Consumer project on technology drugs information</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.bettermediacare.org/who\">Citizens for better medicare</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.commoncause.org\">Common Cause</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Washington teems with a thousand industrial lobbyists. They cluster around the band of luxury offices and expensive restaurants which stretches from the White House to the Capitol building - a two-mile axis along which money and power are constantly traded. In this pantheon of corporate muscle, no industry wields as much power as the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association (PhRMA), a pressure group breathtaking for its deep pockets and aggression, even by the standards of US politics. There was a time not long ago when the corporate giants that PhRMA represents were merely the size of nations. Now, after a frenzied two-year period of pharmaceutical mega-mergers, they are behemoths which outweigh entire continents. The combined worth of the world's top five drug companies is twice the combined GDP of all sub-Saharan Africa and their influence on the rules of world trade is many times stronger because they can bring their wealth to bear directly on the levers of western power. In the struggle between western patent rights and the rest of the world's need for affordable medicine, the few concessions handed to the developing nations in the last year of the Clinton administration are likely to be reversed under Bush. The US government is expected to return to its customary role as a battering ram for the interests of the pharmaceutical industry and the principle of intellectual property. Until recently, the industry hedged its political bets, backing the Democrats and Republicans more or less evenly at election time. But at the last election, it gambled. With billions at stake in a heated debate over prescription drug prices at home and a growing number of patent disputes abroad, the drugmakers stacked their chips disproportionately behind George Bush. The industry spent nearly 70% of its unprecedented $24.4m campaign war chest on the Republicans. The wager paid off - just - and PhRMA has emerged at the apotheosis of its political clout, with grateful Republicans running the White House, Senate and House of Representatives.

      "bodyText": "The Independent Television Commission has flexed its muscles in the interactive TV arena, issuing a series of guidelines for the regulation of iTV services. The main thrust of the guidelines is to establish that, where there is a clear \"doorway\" between TV and an interactive service, it is the responsibility of the broadcasters to ensure the existing regulatory framework is upheld. The ITC has opted to divide interactive TV service into two - dedicated interactive services such as Open, which will not be covered by the ITC's own codes, and enhanced programme services for which a number of rules and safeguards have been developed. The ITC's main safeguards are that current programme standards are especially important; advertising linked to editorial content should remain separated; and children should be protected at all costs. The guidelines do not cover web access via TV, which the ITC feels it is not in a position to try and regulate. Regarding the separation of adverts from programmes, the ITC's new guidelines insist that there should be a \"first click\" screen to prevent viewers going straight from a programme to a commercial environment. Interactive icons, which flash up on screen during programmes, should not carry branding or give any undue prominence to a certain product. In addition, the ITC has laid down strident rules on enhanced TV for \"sensitive categories of programme\", namely news and current affairs, consumer advice programmes and children's programmes. In these three strands of programming, no direct offers for sale will be allowed and certain types of advertising related to the programme content have been banned. To keep a close eye on market developments, the ITC plans to establish a forum for ongoing discussion with the interactive TV industry. The guidelines were drawn up following a series of in-depth consultations with interactive TV licencees over the past year.",

      "bodyText": "Cricket is to get its own brand identity for the first time in an effort to increase the commercial viability of the sport. The sport's governing body, the International Cricket Council, has appointed corporate identity agency Minale Tattersfield Bryce to design an ICC brand. The branding will be used across four of the properties owned and organised by the body - the ICC World Cup, ICC Knockout, ICC Trophy and ICC under-19s World Cup. The decision to develop a brand was taken at a two-day ICC Executive Board meeting in Melbourne last weekend. A series of initiatives for international cricket were approved by the board. At the same meeting, the board announced the establishment of a rankings system called the ICC Test Championship. This will be a rolling \"league of nations\" for five-day Test cricket. A co-ordinated ten-year Test and One-Day International programme and a move towards a fully professional independent international umpiring system were also agreed. An ICC spokesman said the new corporate identity would be the body's first concerted effort to create a commercial brand. \"Now we are involved with big commercial partners like the World Sport Group, which is responsible for marketing our tournaments over the next seven years, we need a more professional and considered image to present potential partners,\" said the spokesman. He said it was undecided whether one ICC brand would run across all four tournaments or whether they would have separate identities. But the deadline for Minale Tattersfield Bryce to create the imagery is June, when it will be presented to the ICC Annual General Meeting in London. The Sydney and Brisbane offices of Minale Tattersfield Bryce are leading the initiative but will bring in staff from the UK and South Africa to help with the project.",

The news from the British oil giant comes hot on the heels of other huge profits in the industry. Exxon Mobil recorded world record corporate annual profits of $17bn for the same time, while Royal Dutch/Shell picked up $13.1bn for the year 2000. BP chief executive, Sir John Browne, said: \"The strong trading environment, together with the benefits of recent integration and restructuring, and productivity improvements, has produced an outstanding worldwide result for BP. \"We have delivered on our 2000 cost saving target and are on track for the cost saving and improvement in return on capital targets by the end of 2001.\" BP's figures are adjusted to take into account one-off charges and credits, including integration costs of US acquisition Arco, as well as rationalisation costs following the BP Amoco merger. The announcement was made as energy companies face pressures from several quarters. Environmentalists are stepping up campaigns for more alternative energy investment and less drilling in sensitive sites, while the fuel protesters who brought the country to a standstill last September will be angered by the news. BP insisted that the scale of the profits was not related to forecourt petrol prices and sales.

The former head of police special forces, Ibrahim Sahin, and a senior intelligence agent, Korkut Eken, were both found guilty of forming and running a criminal gang with the aim of \"creating panic in society\". Eleven others were also found guilty of lesser offences after a long trial and were jailed for four years each. The Turkish public has long been convinced that there was a clear link between the state and the nationalist mafia, but these are the first convictions arising from the scandal in the wake of a car crash in the western town of Susurluk in November 1996. The crash killed a senior police officer, a gangster and a former beauty queen. An MP who was also in the car - and who works closely with the security forces in mainly Kurdish south-eastern Turkey - survived. Incriminating documents and weapons found in the wreckage soon forced the interior minister to resign. What followed was an unprecedented campaign of public protest against corruption and abuse of power in high places. The official report into what became known as the Susurluk affair painted a murky picture of state security agencies using nationalist criminal gangs to kill their political opponents. Among those killed were leftwing journalists and Kurdish activists. In return, the gangs were allowed to smuggle drugs and run extortion operations, laundering many of the profits through a chain of casinos. Elements within the police and the intelligence agencies also used the extensive powers given to them in the fight against Kurdish rebels to commit crimes of their own. The Susurluk report aired allegations that the Turkish secret service, Mit, took part in a failed coup attempt against President Heydar Aliyev of Azerbaijan in 1995, and in an abortive alliance with Israel's Mossad to try to kill the Kurdish rebel leader, Abdullah Ocalan, while he was in Syria. Now, four years after the car crash, some of those involved are being made to take the blame. But critics believe that others - including politicians - are being allowed to go free. \"This verdict only says there was a gang,\" Sema Piskinsut, a deputy who served on a committee investigating links between the underworld and the state, said. \"But what did it do, who did it work for? Parliament should find out who was politically responsible.\" The Susurluk Affair was significant because it sparked genuine fears among ordinary Turks that gangs within the state had been given unfettered control, and could be a threat to democracy. Suspicion of what Turks call \"deep state links\" is still extremely strong. The end of the trial comes amid fears of a renewed effort to destabilise the south-east, which is now enjoying its most peaceful period for years. Two leading members of the pro-Kurdish political party, Hadep, disappeared late last month in Silopi after being asked to visit the local gendarmerie headquarters. Even though the Kurdish rebel movement, the PKK, has largely withdrawn from the south-east, many believe that powerful forces in Turkey still have an interest in maintaining a tight security blanket across the region. The south-east is the hub of a massive smuggling business involving drugs and human migrants. The hugely profitable trade is run by powerful criminal gangs, with the backing of renegade elements within the state - exactly the same combination which sparked the Susurluk scandal in the first place.",

EU immigration officials are in London this week to discuss the coordination of migration and asylum policies, and more immediate practical moves to reduce the influx of refugees, 390,000 of whom applied for asylum in Europe last year. The issue topped the agenda at last week's Franco-British summit in Cahors, where it was agreed that immigration officials from both countries would travel on Eurostar trains between Paris and London via Calais, inspecting papers before and during journeys. According to British officials, up to 400 immigrants a month have been entering Britain illegally by buying Eurostar tickets from the French capital to the Channel port, then staying on the train without proper papers and applying for asylum once upon reaching London. The two wounded men, both stabbed in the chest, were among 15 injured on Sunday evening in a battle at the Red Cross refugee centre in Sangatte, outside Calais. Police said the fight broke out when a Kurdish agent for one of the dozens of smuggling gangs operating around the port was discovered in the centre trying to extort a \"fee\" from a young Afghan refugee who refused to pay. \"It seems the area around the port and the mouth of the tunnel is effectively run by a gang of Kurds, who demand money from refugees simply for the right to try to get across the Channel,\" a police spokesman said. \"The Afghans are the third largest group in the centre, after Iraqi Kurds and Iranians. They stuck together and said no.\" Red Cross workers who man the centre said minor clashes between frustrated refugees had become increasingly common as crossing the Channel had become tougher. \"This place was originally opened in 1999 for 200 people. Right now we have 849,\" Michel Derr, the manager of the centre, said. \"We have reached a critical level of overcrowding and it's generating enormous tension.\" Some 25,000 illegal immigrants were caught trying to cross the Channel at Calais last year, with 1,700 cases reported last month. The French prime minister, Lionel Jospin, last week rejected a radical proposal by London for a \"bilateral repatriation\" accord that would have seen illegal immigrants to Britain sent straight back to France. He insisted that the problems caused by migrants arriving in Calais could be solved only by a broader agreement - either at EU level or by a three-way deal between Britain, France and Italy. EU interior ministers meeting in Stockholm last week agreed to speed up the coordination of asylum policies to cut the number of \"bogus\" applicants, while trying not to ignore genuine refugees fleeing persecution. The British home secretary, Jack Straw, has been pressing hard for more collaboration. Britain got the most asylum applications last year, 97,900. Germany at 78,800 was next.",

It said it would oppose by every means the \"designs to dismantle careers within the community institutions\". The union's main complaint is that Mr Kinnock keeps presenting it with faits accomplis and it feels sidelined. Eurocrats may enjoy scant sympathy in Britain but in Brussels many fonctionnaires feel unfairly maligned and fear that their pay and working conditions are about to be seriously eroded in what they see as a public relations exercise. The former British Labour party leader wants to sweep away the French-style system of time-serving advancement and introduce a meritocratic system of promotions in hopes of erasing the image of Eurocrats as fat cats. The unions have threatened strikes in the past but time is running out for them to make an impact: Mr Kinnock is scheduled to unveil new rules on salaries and pensions on February 28. One reform-minded EU official yesterday accused the unions of scaremongering. \"Kinnock spends half his life negotiating with these people and more time than he does with his family,\" the official said. \"But they have constantly run him down for not speaking French, for being British or a Tony Blair agent. \"They've tried everything to denigrate him.

      "body": "<p>Michael Stone will stand in the dock again later this year, accused for the second time of murdering Lin Russell and her daughter, Megan. But can he get a fair trial this time round? The brutal hammer killing of mother and daughter and the bludgeoning and near-murder of Megan's sister, Josie, as they strolled home from school through idyllic fields in rural Kent was one of the most shocking crimes of the past decade. Stone's conviction in 1998 unleashed a barrage of damning media coverage, pent up before and during the trial .</p> <p>Since then the story has refused to die down, kept in the news by the continuing tale of Josie's recovery and the determined efforts of her father, Shaun, to rebuild a normal life for her. As Stone's QC, William Clegg, told the appeal court last week, the \"fade factor\", which usually dims the public's memory as time passes, has hardly operated in the Russell case. \"If this case was to go to retrial\", argued Clegg, \"then the right of a citizen to have a fair trial not compromised by publicity will in reality be little more than empty words.\" He added: \"It's difficult to imagine anybody having anything worse published about him than this man.\"</p> <p>His plea failed to convince the three judges. They quashed the conviction after hearing that a key witness who claimed Stone had confessed to the killings had retracted his claims, but ordered a new trial. They will give their reasons tomorrow.</p> <p>Judges may order a retrial after quashing a conviction if \"it appears to the court that the interests of justice so require\". The more serious the crime, the more likely the defendant is to face another trial. Yet, paradoxically, the more horrific the crime, the more lurid the coverage - and the more prejudicial the potential effect on the jurors who will eventually try the case.</p> <p>Lord Taylor, the former Lord Chief Justice, acknowledged this in 1996 when he rejected Rosemary West's appeal against her conviction for murdering 10 young women and girls, including her own daughter and step-daughter, with her husband, Fred. West's appeal was based partly on sensationalist press reports before her trial.</p> <p>\"However lurid the reporting,\" said Lord Taylor, \"there can scarcely ever have been a case more calculated to shock the public, who were entitled to know the facts.\" But it would be \"absurd\" to rule that the trial should not therefore have gone ahead. That would mean that if murders were horrendous enough to shock the nation, the accused could never be tried.</p> <p>Judges have traditionally relied on the ability and willingness of jurors to put out of their minds anything read or heard before the trial. In 1969 Reggie and Ronnie Kray were convicted, with much sensational media coverage, of murdering two other gangland figures, Jack \"The Hat\" McVitie and George Cornell. Not long after, they faced another trial, this time for ordering the murder of Frank \"The Mad Axeman\" Mitchell, a man they had helped escape from Dartmoor.</p> <p>Sir Frederick Lawton, who presided over the trial, allowed the defence to cross-examine potential jurors to find out whether they had read the offending stories, something which often happens in the United States but which was almost unknown in the English courts.</p> <p>But he took a robust view of the dangers of prejudicing juries. \"I have enough confidence in my fellow countrymen to think they have got the newspapers sized up, just as they have got other public institutions sized up, and they are capable, in normal circumstances, of looking at a matter fairly and without prejudice, even though they have to disregard what they may have read in a newspaper.\"</p> <p>In 1990 three Irish defendants who were convicted of conspiring to murder the Northern Ireland secretary, Tom King, had their convictions quashed because of media statements during the trial by King and the former Master of the Rolls, Lord Denning. The charges against the three, who had exercised their right of silence and declined to give evidence, were about to go to the jury when King announced a government decision to abolish the right of silence.

      "bodyText": "Michael Stone will stand in the dock again later this year, accused for the second time of murdering Lin Russell and her daughter, Megan. But can he get a fair trial this time round? The brutal hammer killing of mother and daughter and the bludgeoning and near-murder of Megan's sister, Josie, as they strolled home from school through idyllic fields in rural Kent was one of the most shocking crimes of the past decade. Stone's conviction in 1998 unleashed a barrage of damning media coverage, pent up before and during the trial . Since then the story has refused to die down, kept in the news by the continuing tale of Josie's recovery and the determined efforts of her father, Shaun, to rebuild a normal life for her. As Stone's QC, William Clegg, told the appeal court last week, the \"fade factor\", which usually dims the public's memory as time passes, has hardly operated in the Russell case. \"If this case was to go to retrial\", argued Clegg, \"then the right of a citizen to have a fair trial not compromised by publicity will in reality be little more than empty words.\" He added: \"It's difficult to imagine anybody having anything worse published about him than this man.\" His plea failed to convince the three judges. They quashed the conviction after hearing that a key witness who claimed Stone had confessed to the killings had retracted his claims, but ordered a new trial. They will give their reasons tomorrow. Judges may order a retrial after quashing a conviction if \"it appears to the court that the interests of justice so require\". The more serious the crime, the more likely the defendant is to face another trial. Yet, paradoxically, the more horrific the crime, the more lurid the coverage - and the more prejudicial the potential effect on the jurors who will eventually try the case. Lord Taylor, the former Lord Chief Justice, acknowledged this in 1996 when he rejected Rosemary West's appeal against her conviction for murdering 10 young women and girls, including her own daughter and step-daughter, with her husband, Fred. West's appeal was based partly on sensationalist press reports before her trial. \"However lurid the reporting,\" said Lord Taylor, \"there can scarcely ever have been a case more calculated to shock the public, who were entitled to know the facts.\" But it would be \"absurd\" to rule that the trial should not therefore have gone ahead. That would mean that if murders were horrendous enough to shock the nation, the accused could never be tried. Judges have traditionally relied on the ability and willingness of jurors to put out of their minds anything read or heard before the trial. In 1969 Reggie and Ronnie Kray were convicted, with much sensational media coverage, of murdering two other gangland figures, Jack \"The Hat\" McVitie and George Cornell. Not long after, they faced another trial, this time for ordering the murder of Frank \"The Mad Axeman\" Mitchell, a man they had helped escape from Dartmoor. Sir Frederick Lawton, who presided over the trial, allowed the defence to cross-examine potential jurors to find out whether they had read the offending stories, something which often happens in the United States but which was almost unknown in the English courts. But he took a robust view of the dangers of prejudicing juries. \"I have enough confidence in my fellow countrymen to think they have got the newspapers sized up, just as they have got other public institutions sized up, and they are capable, in normal circumstances, of looking at a matter fairly and without prejudice, even though they have to disregard what they may have read in a newspaper.\" In 1990 three Irish defendants who were convicted of conspiring to murder the Northern Ireland secretary, Tom King, had their convictions quashed because of media statements during the trial by King and the former Master of the Rolls, Lord Denning. The charges against the three, who had exercised their right of silence and declined to give evidence, were about to go to the jury when King announced a government decision to abolish the right of silence. Lord Denning weighed in to say that exercising the right of silence in terrorist cases was tantamount to admitting guilt. The outcome in that case inspired more defence counsel to argue, and judges to accept, that pre-trial publicity could endanger a fair trial. The Taylor sisters, Michelle and Lisa, had their convictions for murdering the wife of Michelle's former lover quashed in 1994 partly because they had been subjected to \"trial by media,\" and partly because of irregularities during the trial. In 1995, a judge threw out a prosecution against three alleged forgers exposed by the News of the World because the paper had printed details about the men's previous convictions, referred to them as \"villains\" and attributed a quote about drugs and children to one. Lawyers were astonished that the prosecution, which had been instigated by the paper's investigation, had been derailed by a single newspaper story published 10 months before. Three months later a prosecution for assault against Geoffrey Knights, boyfriend of the EastEnders actress Gillian Taylforth, was thrown out after graphic accounts of the attack appeared in several tabloids. But when the crime is as serious as murder, tabloid headlines weigh more lightly in the scales of justice. Judges have long maintained that the closed world of the courtroom, where everyone is focusing on the evidence put before them, together with the judge's warning to put everything else out of their minds, is enough to dispel any prejudice that might linger from months-old, barely remembered news stories. The truth of this surmise was anybody's guess. The Contempt of Court Act 1981 bars English jurors from being questioned about the secrets of the jury room.

The plane costs \u00a3285, \u00a3180 if you stay overnight (go figure European price fixing). This is completely crazy, I tell myself, as I climb aboard.

You fly right over the Eolie islands and then, dropping down, quite suddenly there is Etna, a picture-book volcano, its high crater topped with Christmas icing.

There's a difference. Then there's more noise in the street than in Verona and the traffic is constantly on the verge of total deadlock. Whereas Verona, through its foggy winters, has warm ochre walls and pink marble pavements, Catania under its blistering summer sun is lava gray, a monumental mix of volcanic rock and white limestone. </p> <p>Yet overall what strikes you most is that these are all variations within the same Italian mindframe.

There's the same love of the passeggiata, the same Christmas markets full of candied fruit and cheap toys. </p> <p>I take a bus east to check out the fishing village of Aci Trezza, where Giovanni Verga set his great novel I Malavoglia. Stone angels on the church facade blow their judgment-day trumpets right in the noses of the painted boats pulled up in the port. The place is so beautiful, it's hard to see how Verga could have been such a pessimist.

When an avalanche is called upon, it's a safe bet things will go downhill from there. Often, at high speed. </p> <p>So <strong> Silent Witness</strong> (BBC1) started with an avalanche caused, the man in the snowflake jumper said, by a couple of snowboarders. Personally, I think it was triggered by the woman who wails her way through the aria-esque Silent Witness theme tune (which I imagine to be entitled Here Comes Laughing Sam Ryan). </p> <p>Whatever, the Norwegian Search and Rescue turned up (helpfully wearing little fluorescent waistcoats with \"Norwegian Search and Rescue\" written on the back - in English) and dug out the snowboarders and the naked body of an English girl. Cue Laughing Sam, who half-shut her eyes and stared at the body. There was no doubt about it - the girl was dead. </p> <p>It transpired that the snowflake jumper man was Jan (which is Norwegian for \"Ugly Knitwear\"). As preposterous as it might seem, he was a friend of Sam's, and between them they discovered the dead girl had been entombed in the snow for some 15 years, though not before telling the parents of another girl it was their missing daughter. Oops. Still, it wasn't oops for long since they then found the body of that girl too. (In their defence, it was an easy mistake to make, since both girls looked like Jo from S Club 7. Until they were defrosted. Then they looked like Baroness Young.) </p> <p>Thus, Laughing Sam was dragged into the middle of the investigation being carried out by the jowly and truculent police officer and his oddly mute assistant. Now, you might not think \"jowly and truculent\" qualify as defining characteristics in a drama, but here they did. As did \"floppy-haired holiday rep\" and \"potato-headed gamekeeper\". In fact, the sketchy shorthand writing that passes for character description in Silent Witness was only surpassed by the clunky-as-a-bag-of-spanners dialogue. </p> <p>Of course none of this is new, as it is years since any Silent Witness actually had a decent, involving and complex script. As long as they can wheel in a slew of guest stars (this time, the librarian from Buffy the Vampire Slayer), have a couple of post-mortem scenes in which Sam lifts an unidentified organ onto some scales, and have Amanda Burton looking pensive, the producers don't feel the need to bother with anything resembling good writing. All of that was fine before the novelty wore off, but now Silent Witness is as cold and mechanical as Laughing Sam's circular rib saw. </p> <p>And in the first half of this story, Sam did even less than she normally does - which usually extends to being as expressive as a roll of lino - and instead consulted a profiler, who seemed to do most of the work for her. This Professor Michaels (graduated from Angels, no less) seemed more interesting than Sam did and much more deserving of her own series. Not only did she smile more, you couldn't see her bra through her jumper. </p> <p>A banging theme tune and psychedelic graphics? Could <strong> Tribe</strong> (BBC2) be a yoof programme? It surely could - and a rather good one at that. Essentially the latest mutation in video diaries, Tribe followed Londoner Laura who was \"in the garage industry\", and a group of rough boys in Wales who had nothing to do all day but fight (and get their girlfriends pregnant). </p> <p>While the tale of Dom, Darryl and Spuddy, who lived on an estate where washing got stolen from the line and three-legged dogs hobbled the street, was depressing and distressing, Laura's meander through her life was oddly uplifting. If only because the girl seemed completely bonkers. </p> <p>Laura's part in the garage industry seemed to consist of flyering unsuspecting passers-by on chilly London nights, taking abuse from her boss who thought herself too cool by half, and going raving with her mate, Sunshine. Laura loved the Heartless Crew, who despite their names - Mighty Mo, Fonty and Bushkin - weren't actually cartoon characters. She adored their lyrics, which were \"intelligent\". Talking straight to camera as if she was born to do it, Laura marvelled at such lyrical wit as, \"You can shine on my penis/I mean this/I'm not joking.\" </p> <p>Eminem, eat your heart out.</p>",

As preposterous as it might seem, he was a friend of Sam's, and between them they discovered the dead girl had been entombed in the snow for some 15 years, though not before telling the parents of another girl it was their missing daughter. Oops. Still, it wasn't oops for long since they then found the body of that girl too. (In their defence, it was an easy mistake to make, since both girls looked like Jo from S Club 7. Until they were defrosted. Then they looked like Baroness Young.) Thus, Laughing Sam was dragged into the middle of the investigation being carried out by the jowly and truculent police officer and his oddly mute assistant. Now, you might not think \"jowly and truculent\" qualify as defining characteristics in a drama, but here they did. As did \"floppy-haired holiday rep\" and \"potato-headed gamekeeper\". In fact, the sketchy shorthand writing that passes for character description in Silent Witness was only surpassed by the clunky-as-a-bag-of-spanners dialogue. Of course none of this is new, as it is years since any Silent Witness actually had a decent, involving and complex script. As long as they can wheel in a slew of guest stars (this time, the librarian from Buffy the Vampire Slayer), have a couple of post-mortem scenes in which Sam lifts an unidentified organ onto some scales, and have Amanda Burton looking pensive, the producers don't feel the need to bother with anything resembling good writing. All of that was fine before the novelty wore off, but now Silent Witness is as cold and mechanical as Laughing Sam's circular rib saw. And in the first half of this story, Sam did even less than she normally does - which usually extends to being as expressive as a roll of lino - and instead consulted a profiler, who seemed to do most of the work for her. This Professor Michaels (graduated from Angels, no less) seemed more interesting than Sam did and much more deserving of her own series. Not only did she smile more, you couldn't see her bra through her jumper. A banging theme tune and psychedelic graphics? Could Tribe (BBC2) be a yoof programme? It surely could - and a rather good one at that. Essentially the latest mutation in video diaries, Tribe followed Londoner Laura who was \"in the garage industry\", and a group of rough boys in Wales who had nothing to do all day but fight (and get their girlfriends pregnant). While the tale of Dom, Darryl and Spuddy, who lived on an estate where washing got stolen from the line and three-legged dogs hobbled the street, was depressing and distressing, Laura's meander through her life was oddly uplifting. If only because the girl seemed completely bonkers. Laura's part in the garage industry seemed to consist of flyering unsuspecting passers-by on chilly London nights, taking abuse from her boss who thought herself too cool by half, and going raving with her mate, Sunshine. Laura loved the Heartless Crew, who despite their names - Mighty Mo, Fonty and Bushkin - weren't actually cartoon characters. She adored their lyrics, which were \"intelligent\". Talking straight to camera as if she was born to do it, Laura marvelled at such lyrical wit as, \"You can shine on my penis/I mean this/I'm not joking.\" Eminem, eat your heart out.",

Yesterday you would have had to be stranded on a capsized boat in the middle of an ocean, without any ship-to-shore communication, to remain unaware of her. She was on the front page of every newspaper, topped every morning news bulletin and across the country her success spread an unexpected feeling of national pride and celebration, not experienced since Steve Redgrave won his fifth gold at Sydney.</p> <p>So what had she done? After 94 days, four hours and 25 minutes at sea, 24-year-old MacArthur had crossed the finishing line of the Vend\u00e9e Globe round-the-world yacht race.

The fact that she came second to Frenchman Michel Desjoyeaux did not matter.</p> <p>And we now know - thanks to page upon page of analysis - that it was indeed a truly remarkable achievement. The Vend\u00e9e is the toughest race in the sailing world; others have died trying to complete the 26,000-mile course around Antarctica and the physical demands placed upon competitors are almost unsurpassed.</p> <p>MacArthur has been on her own for the past three months, skippering a yacht that would usually require an 11-strong crew. She has changed sails twice her weight a dozen times a day; she has scaled the 90ft mast to carry out repairs in 40-knot winds; she has lived off dehydrated food and 10-minute catnaps; she has dodged icebergs, defied the elements and stared death in the face more than once.</p> <p>An extraordinary adventure story, but what has made it all the more interesting for the media is the fact that the hero is a woman.

In many papers, 24-year-old MacArthur is referred to as a \"girl\"; the coverage, centring on her proud parents, has almost without exception failed to mention that she has a long-term partner who also met her off the dock.

      "body": "<p>There is something poignant about the reluctance of the great 92-year-old photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson to have his picture circulated. Cartier-Bresson has objected to a book of photographs of him by the American David Douglas Duncan, entitled Faceless. They are mediocre, \"snapshots\" rather than true portraits, he protests. But it can't be just the quality of the pictures that has upset him. Duncan too is a famous photographer, whose images of the Korean war are classics. He was able to photograph Cartier-Bresson casually, over drinks at the Mus\u00e9e Picasso in Paris, because Cartier-Bres son was on assignment to photograph him. The fact is, the world's most revered photographer hates having his picture taken. </p> <p>He's not alone. Who doesn't have a fear of the camera's power to tell us what we are? From posing for our first school photo, we learn the oppressiveness of the camera, its power to define us. Think of poor Marilyn Monroe, going through the contact sheets of her photo sessions, crossing out shots she didn't like. Artists, who understand the authority of visual experience, are not less but more mystical about the power of the image. </p> <p>Cartier-Bresson at least allows some images of himself to circulate. Stanley Kubrick, who began as a photojournalist, be came such a stranger to snappers that an impersonator was able to pass himself off as the director despite looking nothing like him.

      "bodyText": "There is something poignant about the reluctance of the great 92-year-old photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson to have his picture circulated. Cartier-Bresson has objected to a book of photographs of him by the American David Douglas Duncan, entitled Faceless. They are mediocre, \"snapshots\" rather than true portraits, he protests. But it can't be just the quality of the pictures that has upset him. Duncan too is a famous photographer, whose images of the Korean war are classics. He was able to photograph Cartier-Bresson casually, over drinks at the Mus\u00e9e Picasso in Paris, because Cartier-Bres son was on assignment to photograph him. The fact is, the world's most revered photographer hates having his picture taken. He's not alone. Who doesn't have a fear of the camera's power to tell us what we are? From posing for our first school photo, we learn the oppressiveness of the camera, its power to define us. Think of poor Marilyn Monroe, going through the contact sheets of her photo sessions, crossing out shots she didn't like. Artists, who understand the authority of visual experience, are not less but more mystical about the power of the image. Cartier-Bresson at least allows some images of himself to circulate. Stanley Kubrick, who began as a photojournalist, be came such a stranger to snappers that an impersonator was able to pass himself off as the director despite looking nothing like him. And who can say what part was played in the disintegration of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman's marriage by their decision to play a married couple to Kubrick's searching camera in Eyes Wide Shut? The camera seemed to capture a lack of physical passion in their scenes together, and a falseness in the marriage that has now collapsed. Yet Kubrick did allow one person to portray him - his wife.

      "body": "<p>The Rev Will Pugh, who has died aged 84, affected the lives of many young people in the Liverpool suburb of West Derby, then a lower middle-class housing estate, in the years immediately following the second world war, when he formed what became a large and successful youth club. With his upright frame, much-worn sports coat, mop of unruly black hair and piercing eyes, he had the talents of an eccentric teacher of genius.</p> <p>The son of a Merchant Navy steward, Pugh was born and raised in Liverpool. He was educated at the Liverpool Institute high school and studied theology at King's College London, before becoming a curate at St Mary's parish church, West Derby, where, in 1945, he founded a youth club.</p> <p>He saw it as part of the Christian community, but was too wise to attempt preachiness at meetings, or to confine membership to Christians. The club flourished because Will had the ability to speak to several hundred young people at once, and leave each one feeling that his words had been directed at them alone. He shared with club members his enthusiasm for fencing, amateur dramatics, climbing in Switzerland, and listening to classical music amid the Edwardian decor of his drawing room.</p> <p>The club's extensive programme, largely financed by subscriptions and Will's slender stipend, helped to inspire change in other Merseyside clubs, although few leaders possessed Will's rapport with young people.</p> <p>Meanwhile, he was a turbulent priest, who found committee work uncongenial - it meant compromise - and never attended clerical meetings. For many years, there was a guerrilla war with his highly conventional rector. He rarely remembered that a curate was supposed to be a subordinate; unsurprisingly, he was never promoted. Typically, Will added to the annual Rose Queen parade a float bearing Queen Rosie, a whiskery youth in drag, pulled by a pantomime horse.</p> <p>Revenge by the church establishment came in 1960. After studying the Oxford Movement for two years, for a research degree at Christ Church, Oxford, Will returned to West Derby expecting that his job would still be open. Within months, however, the church stopped paying his stipend.

      "bodyText": "The Rev Will Pugh, who has died aged 84, affected the lives of many young people in the Liverpool suburb of West Derby, then a lower middle-class housing estate, in the years immediately following the second world war, when he formed what became a large and successful youth club. With his upright frame, much-worn sports coat, mop of unruly black hair and piercing eyes, he had the talents of an eccentric teacher of genius. The son of a Merchant Navy steward, Pugh was born and raised in Liverpool. He was educated at the Liverpool Institute high school and studied theology at King's College London, before becoming a curate at St Mary's parish church, West Derby, where, in 1945, he founded a youth club. He saw it as part of the Christian community, but was too wise to attempt preachiness at meetings, or to confine membership to Christians. The club flourished because Will had the ability to speak to several hundred young people at once, and leave each one feeling that his words had been directed at them alone. He shared with club members his enthusiasm for fencing, amateur dramatics, climbing in Switzerland, and listening to classical music amid the Edwardian decor of his drawing room. The club's extensive programme, largely financed by subscriptions and Will's slender stipend, helped to inspire change in other Merseyside clubs, although few leaders possessed Will's rapport with young people. Meanwhile, he was a turbulent priest, who found committee work uncongenial - it meant compromise - and never attended clerical meetings. For many years, there was a guerrilla war with his highly conventional rector. He rarely remembered that a curate was supposed to be a subordinate; unsurprisingly, he was never promoted. Typically, Will added to the annual Rose Queen parade a float bearing Queen Rosie, a whiskery youth in drag, pulled by a pantomime horse. Revenge by the church establishment came in 1960. After studying the Oxford Movement for two years, for a research degree at Christ Church, Oxford, Will returned to West Derby expecting that his job would still be open. Within months, however, the church stopped paying his stipend. Until his retirement in 1981, he taught religious instruction - very successfully - to sixth formers at Ormskirk grammar school. At the same time, however, his marriage was under strain. So enlightened elsewhere, Will was an authoritarian paterfamilias; he could not argue rationally about women priests - an idea he opposed - and the only television programme he did not denounce was one on the Chelsea Flower Show. He and his wife separated. In his last 20 years he promoted frequent youth club reunions, which hundreds attended. He hated marking his 80th birthday, and gifts were banned. On his death-bed, he was visited by more faithful friends than his house could accommodate. He is survived by his wife, Shirley, two sons and three daughters.

A highly accomplished and prolific poet, he was capable of working in a great variety of metrical forms, and was a master of free verse. His poetry, always imbued with a certain intellectuality, ranged extensively from the confessional and anecdotal to the philosophical and metaphysical, and he could shift register with extraordinary skill, from the lyrical to the factual to the speculative, within the bound of a single poem.</p> <p>In this respect he had learned much from TS Eliot and Ezra Pound, whose formal diversities and virtuoso uses of poetic impersonality he adapted with great originality to his own purposes in Italian.</p> <p>Sanesi was also a major translator of English and American poetry, making available for the first time much of the historical and modernist canons of British, Irish and American verse. He directed Italian versions of plays by Shakespeare, Marlowe and Eliot, and wrote and translated libretti for operatic productions, including Benjamin Britten's The Turn Of The Screw.</p> <p>A sensitive, respected and enthusiastic art critic, he was greatly loved by those whose work he championed. He created his own form of quick and fanciful pictorial calligraphy, and exhibited and published it with great success. He was also a gifted teacher and broadcaster.</p> <p>Sanesi was born in Milan and spent his childhood mostly in Prato, near Florence, where he lived and worked for the rest of his life. His career as a critic began in the 1950s as a writer for Aut-Aut magazine and founder of Edizioni del Triangulo, a small company dedicated to publishing the poetry and drawings of contemporary artists and writers, including Kenneth Patchen, Enrico Baj, Gianni Dova, William Carlos Williams - and others.</p> <p>In 1958, Sanesi made the first of many extended visits to south Wales; he travelled by train with a sailor's kitbag, directly from Milan to Oystermouth. He had come to work on a book about Dylan Thomas and to meet Thomas's friend, the poet Vernon Watkins, whose work he had also translated.</p> <p>In that year, too, he met the painters Alfred Janes and Ceri Richards. Sanesi maintained an intense critical interest in these closely linked Welsh friends. He also met Henry Moore and Graham Sutherland, and was to write about both with a deep insight into their roots in English visionary romanticism.</p> <p>Following the publication, in 1958 and 1960, of anthologies of translated modern American and English poetry - including works by Walt Whitman, Hart Crane, Wallace Stevens, WB Yeats, WH Auden, William Empson and David Gascoyne - Sanesi was authorised by Eliot to translate his works into Italian. In three superb volumes, published by Bompiani in Milan (1987, 1992 and 1993), he made the complete works of Eliot in poetry, drama and prose available to the Italian reading public. The 1980s saw also the publication of a masterly Italian version of Paradise Lost.</p> <p>Sanesi was a crucial interpreter of British and American literary and visual culture to contemporary Italy and maintained an astonishing range of critical-creative activities. He wrote extensively and with great distinction on Italian art and literature, in books, magazines and newspapers, and was a regular contributor to Corriere della Sera. He taught at the universities of Parma and Verona, and was sometime professor of comparative literature at the Academy of Brera; he directed Italian versions of Shakespeare and Eliot at theatres in Bologna, Verona and Milan, and adapted Shakespeare and Marlowe for Swiss-Italian radio.</p> <p>Throughout the 1960s, Sanesi edited the influential journal Poesia e Critica, and in 1972 founded the Munt Press, which published poetry and essays by international writers, including Octavia Paz and Simone de Beauvoir. From 1970 to 1975, he was artistic director of Palazzo Grassi in Venice.</p> <p>He was, however, before anything else, a poet of outstanding gift, constantly writing and publishing from his mid-20s until his death.

Churchdown public school, in the same piece, should have been Churchdown secondary state school \u0095 In our report of Charlton v Newcastle, page 2, Sport, yesterday, we spelt the name of Charlton's South African striker wrongly: he is Shaun Bartlett, not Sean Bartlett. \u0095 In the large picture across pages 8 and 9, Media, yesterday, Paul Krassner is on the left, not the right. \u0095 The moray patterns, referred to in a caption on page 47, Weekend, February 10, are moir\u00e9 patterns. \u0095 A clue in our cryptic crossword on February 9, could only be solved, as those who referred to the solution on page 12, Saturday Review, February 10, would have been dismayed to discover, by misspelling the word Iridesce (by inserting an additional \"r\"). \u0095 Homophone corner, from page 29, Finance, February 10: \"A peak at yesterday's results revealed that Shell is sitting on a cash pile of around \u00a38bn.\" It is the policy of the Guardian to correct significant errors as soon as possible.

However, he was also able to strike a deal with Percy Sutton, the African-American leader in Manhattan, by promising to back Sutton for mayor in 1977. And he was supported by the Republican governor, Nelson Rockefeller, who planned to run for president and needed to dissociate himself from Lindsay's unpopular regime.</p> <p>The crisis broke with full force in March 1975, when New York was refused credit by the bond market; later that year there was serious danger of a default on the city's debt.

Firstly, if South Africa can afford to buy submarines it can afford drugs. That is their choice as a mature nation but you have to question the wisdom of politicians who put people's lives some way below macho military posturing.</p> <p>And, in the case of HIV combination therapy, patient compliance is a huge problem in the developed world - maybe 16 pills at a time, some before meals, some after meals, all requiring a rigid daily regime if they are to be effective. It is not easy to see how such therapies could be applied where there is severe poverty. <br><b>Danny O'Hare </b><br>Brighton <br><a href=\"mailto:D.OHare@bton.ac.uk\">D.OHare@bton.ac.uk</a></p> <p>\u0095 Without expensive research, which unfortunately at the moment only the big companies appear willing to fund, AZT and other drugs would never have arrived on the market at all.

      "bodyText": "Your front page story (At the mercy of drug giants, February 12) excoriating the pharmaceutical companies for not selling their drugs at a loss raises several interesting points. Firstly, if South Africa can afford to buy submarines it can afford drugs. That is their choice as a mature nation but you have to question the wisdom of politicians who put people's lives some way below macho military posturing. And, in the case of HIV combination therapy, patient compliance is a huge problem in the developed world - maybe 16 pills at a time, some before meals, some after meals, all requiring a rigid daily regime if they are to be effective. It is not easy to see how such therapies could be applied where there is severe poverty. Danny O'Hare Brighton D.OHare@bton.ac.uk \u0095 Without expensive research, which unfortunately at the moment only the big companies appear willing to fund, AZT and other drugs would never have arrived on the market at all. At least under current rulings some can benefit, until patents eventually expire, and the drug becomes available at the \"generic\" pricings. A scenario could be envisaged where a new epidemic (vCJD?) is ignored by Glaxo and friends because they know their billions invested would merely become charity. Are companies to be forced then to make gifts of all their research to the world? Why not also force the software, engineering and chemical sectors to surrender their patents; after all, they could all be said to be holding back poorer nations on the basis of this \"knowledge economy\".

His departure - together with that of his operations director, Brian Worrall - was announced after a year in which he had publicly locked horns with hundreds of independent publishers and some of his own bookshop managers in an attempt to turn his company around financially. At the peak of the unrest late last year, Mr Kneale, 47, was accused on BBC2's Newsnight of bullying small presses. Last night one independent publisher, asking not to be named, said, \"There is no sorrow around that he has gone\". The departures are understood to have been agreed late on Friday after a meeting with Alan Giles, chief executive of HMV Media, Waterstone's parent group. Yesterday's brief HMV statement said Mr Kneale and Mr Worrall had \"agreed to leave the company with immediate effect\", with another senior executive, Brian McLaughlin, temporarily stepping in as managing director. Mr McLaughlin said both men understood \"that a change in approach is necessary in order to accelerate the recovery of the business\". The parting was \"amicable\". It was, among other factors, Mr Kneale's efforts to increase centralisation of book ordering which brought conflict with sections of the book trade. He maintained the chain had 16m unsold books, partly because branch managers had become \"a soft touch\" for publishers' sales reps. He sent a shiver through the trade by threatening to breach a hallowed publishing ritual by stopping his managers seeing reps. He dismissed his Manchester Piccadilly manager, Robert Topping, for allegedly failing to conform to the new policy. He did, however, command some sympathetic respect among analysts for his dilemmas within a struggling chain with an indebted parent company and a static books market. This was not immediately reflected in last night's reaction from the independent presses which succeeded in partly reversing his attempts to impose book discounts of up to 50% on them this winter. Gary Pulsifer, head of Arcadia Press, said: \"Waterstone's have had a solid year of bad publicity in different areas. \"That must have played a part in these departures.\" Sheila Bounford, secretary of the 350-strong Independent Publishers Guild, said: \"We hope the change of approach announced by Brian McLaughlin will include quickly taking steps to repair the damage to trading relationships with small and independent publishers done in recent months. \"Publishers will be looking for signals from Waterstone's that the new management will recognise their importance to the reading public's perception of Waterstone's as the UK's premier range-holding bookselling chain\". Last year was disastrous for Waterstone's. Comparable sales for the chain fell marginally to \u00a3404m while operating profits at the book chain slumped by 34% to \u00a326.4m. Part of the blame was put on disruption caused by the merger of Waterstone's and Dillons but the chain also suffered from intense price competition. There was some better news in the run up to Christmas when sales improved by 5.6% but longer term sales have stabilised at best. Although HMV Media is not actively seeking buyers for Waterstone's, insiders at the group suggest it would not baulk at a decent offer. The group, which is largely owned by EMI and the venture capital firm Advent, is saddled with debts of around \u00a3567m. Last year it turned down at least two approaches, one from Bertelsmann, the German media group which owns the Random House publishing business, and one from the founder, Tim Waterstone. Mr Waterstone, who has been a fierce critic of HMV Media's stewardship of the chain, is still keen to buy the business back.

In an exclusive article for the Guardian to mark the 12th anniversary of the shooting, Michael Finucane, 29, said he believed \"the British government was responsible\" for the death of his father, who was gunned down in front of him as they ate dinner on Sunday, February 12 1989. \"It is an image seared into my mind,\" the article says. \"The thing I remember most vividly is the noise; the reports of each bullet reverberating in the kitchen, how my grip on my younger brother and sister tightened with every shot.\" \"(The murder) happened because he was a determined and innovative lawyer, and not, as the RUC and others claim, because he was involved in paramilitary activity. \"Both the RUC and the British government had a powerful motivation to kill him. He was among the first to successfully take the government to the European court of human rights over its practices in Northern Ireland. \"Our goal is a public, independent international inquiry into all the circumstances surrounding the murder.\" Sensitivity over the murder of Patrick Finucane has intensified recently as an inquiry into collusion, launched by Scotland Yard, has attempted to unravel links between loyalists and a secret army intelligence cell, the force research unit, which handled all the army's undercover agents in Northern Ireland in the 1980s and early 1990s. Nervousness within the Ministry of Defence has led to injunctions against newspapers which have reported the allegations of a former FRU member, known as Martin Ingram. Last weekend the MoD also banned newspapers from identifying an undercover British soldier who is at the centre of the Scotland Yard investigation. The woman, one of the FRU's main handlers of its loyalist agents, was named on a widely-read US website called Cryptome. After leaving Ireland, she was promoted to the rank of captain in the intelligence corps and now trains recruits at its headquarters in Chicksands, Bedfordshire. The Scotland Yard team wants to interview her as well as Brigadier Gordon Kerr, former commander of the FRU and now British defence attache in Beijing. The MoD and Treasury solicitor has warned it will take legal action against British newspapers who name the officer - known as Captain M. The threat comes despite the publication of the name on the website and against the advice of Admiral Nick Wilkinson, secretary of the 'D Notice' advisory committee which runs a system of voluntary self-censorhip in cooperation with the media. He said yesterday her name was now in the public domain - the test now applied by British courts on whether the media should be able to publish information about the activities of the security and intelligence agencies.",

Sir Burke Trend, who held the job in the 1960s, with an aloof manner and superior judgment, was a super-mandarin for the ages. When his successor, Sir John Hunt, appeared in court in 1975 to contest publication of the Crossman diaries, we witnessed an unprecedented descent from Olympus to the forum. Hitherto the cabinet secretary had barely been seen, let alone heard.</p> <p>Next up, Sir Robert Armstrong, was forced into the open by Mrs Thatcher, to make a humiliating journey to Australia to stop Spycatcher: a bad day for the mystique of a very special post. But Armstrong's prestige was as respected as his cunning. It would not have occurred to him, in any circumstances, to take lunch with the Hinduja brothers of his time.</p> <p>What these men had in common was high intellect, but also authoritative intimacy with their political masters. They were feared in Whitehall. Their judgment really mattered. They all had many fierce problems to settle every day. None of these involved ruling on the fate of ministers charged with some kind of scandal. That was political work. But it's a fair assumption that if they'd been called on to sort out that particular kind of mess, neither Trend nor Hunt nor Armstrong would have allowed panic to overcome due process. The cabinet secretary should be a bulwark, above all, against panic.</p> <p>The last two cabinet secretaries have been judges at the centre of just such scandal, and they've both made a mess of it. Quality in high office seems to be declining. Sir Robin Butler refused to investigate a welter of evidence against Jonathan Aitken, preferring, in establishment style, to believe the word of a minister against that of the editor of the Guardian. Stubbornly and at leisure, Butler protested Aitken's innocence. Thanks to him, a corrupt minister for a while kept his job.</p> <p>Now Sir Richard Wilson has made the opposite mistake in the case of Peter Mandelson, becoming an accomplice in panic which removed a decent minister from his job and maybe from politics. The sheet-anchor of propriety and process abetted the very folly which the man in his position is paid to resist.</p> <p>Mandelson has not been sensible in the past few days. Visiting the enemy press to plead his case exposed him to forms of manipulation and publicity which the old Mandy would never have risked. He looks a bit of a bloody fool, and nameless slimebags in his party have rushed to defame him further. Oliver James, who deserves to be struck off the psychiatrists' register for unprofessional conduct, has pronounced him suicidal.</p> <p>But the Hammond inquiry will find it hard to prove a case against him that measures up to the punishment he's already suffered. If it does not, Tony Blair will look a rotten boss, but Sir Richard Wilson's failure to behave like a proper cabinet secre tary will have been substantially to blame.</p> <p>The decline in respect for the job is not all his fault. The tendency has Thatcherite origins, from a time when the personal familiars of the leader began to weaken the influence of the professional civil service. Mrs Thatcher never did think much of Whitehall. Under Blair, the eclipse of the mandarins at the centre of government is more pronounced. When Wilson got his job, three months after the 1997 election, he arrived to find Blairite chiefs of staff and press officers who mattered more to the leader, inexperienced as he was in government, than the descendant, however august, of Burke Trend.</p> <p>Besides, Wilson wasn't picked for his authority. He's a fixer and agreeable smoothie, not a Trend. Nor was he expected, or allowed, to be particularly close. When the Mandelson panic began, Wilson therefore came at it with disadvantages. Nonetheless, he should have done more to insist on the observance of a system and process which are in his stewardship.</p> <p>That he didn't take that seriously enough may have had something to do with where he came from. As the former boss of the Home Office, he seems to have believed what Home Office officials reported about what happened, via Mandelson, in 1998. In a very short time, without assembling all the evidence, he was hustled into lending the weight of his once-great office to the condign verdict against the minister.</p> <p>Since then, the suspicion has grown that Home Office officials were allowing a miasma of rumour and half- remembered suspicion to congeal into \"fact\". Other versions were not tested. Perhaps not surprisingly, the latest word is that Wilson is seeking to distance himself from the events of the last week in January, hinting that Downing Street had more to do with them than he did.</p> <p>That's not the only word emerging from the turmoil. After a week of slagging Mandelson off, No 10 now calls for calm and says he should be allowed to defend himself. It's obvious what's happening. Belatedly, the official machine feels the need to prepare itself for the possibility that Hammond will not find its conduct in all respects justifiable. The murmur of preparatory damage limitation shimmers round the system, both in particular, as regards the cabinet secretary, and in general on behalf of the Downing Street apparatus.</p> <p>Hammond is inquiring only into the events of 1998, and the bearing these have on a single sequence of remarks allegedly made by Mandelson in recent weeks. Maybe the investigation will find conclusive proof, that a) he intervened to influence a Hinduja passport application and b) he told, in Jack Straw's word, an \"untruth\" about that recently.</p> <p>Or maybe not. Though Hammond himself is a former Home Office man, he'll be aware that public scrutiny of his account and its supporting evidence will be intense. He won't get away with any kind of fiddle. More likely, he will be able to point to no more than a series of cock-ups unverifiable as evidence of personal guilt.</p> <p>On the other hand, Hammond won't be looking at the whole of what happened early in 2001. This is a very big pity. As regards our system of government, Mandelson's (at worst) slender intervention in 1998, if it was made at all, is far less worrying than the hysteria that gripped the prime minister's office on January 29. That is the political moment that needs taking apart.</p> <p>Not only did it destroy a minister who will probably turn out not to have done anything bad enough to deserve such a fate. It also exposed a system of politics that has broken the rules of orderly government, with the connivance of the official who was once the guarantor of those rules, the great umpire who protected the basic ethics of government. The cabinet secretary has been brought very low when he can't remind the prime minister of the prudence, let alone the morality, of not panicking.

      "bodyText": "US online auctioneer eBay appeared to cast a shadow over the prospects for its European competitor, QXL, as an independent company after reports yesterday that it would buy the leading internet auction site in France, iBazar. Purchasing the French site would increase eBay's significant lead in Europe over QXL, whose third quarter earnings today are expected to highlight deepening losses. The deal is believed to be an all-paper affair worth about \u20ac100m (\u00a364m). One analyst said that an iBazar acquisition by eBay \"was not necessarily bad news\" for the British company. He said the move could show that eBay was ready to purchase more companies in Europe. Neither eBay nor iBazar would comment. Before the drop in internet company valuations last year, QXL had hoped to be a formidable competitor to eBay, buying the leading German auction site Ricardo.de and expanding into ten other countries. EBay, the leading US auction site, has also been on the acquisition trail, purchasing Alando.de in Germany and expanding into Italy, Australia, Canada, Austria, France, Italy, and Japan. QXL's share price did not change after yesterday's news, but it has already fallen from a year high of 800p to 12p, and its cash reserves have been depleted by a series of expensive acquisitions. Acquiring iBazar could seal eBay's lead over QXL, as the French company has proved successful in its home market and is also the favoured auction site in Italy, Spain, Sweden, Holland, Belgium and Brazil - countries where eBay does not have a significant presence. While the Wall Street Journal says that a deal could be forthcoming as early as this week, iBazar and eBay have a somewhat acrimonious history. Last October, the French company registered the domain name ebay.fr, inspiring its American competitor to sue for rights to the name. iBazar's chief executive, Marc Piquemal, had registered the name more than a year before eBay began its foray into France. The suit was heard in a French court in December but, in a surprising turn, the judge found in favour of iBazar. Local competition laws pre vent two companies in the same line of business holding the same name, but because Mr Piquemal had registered it under a second, non-competing company he also owned, he was exempt. The case angered many French internet companies, who saw iBazar as abusing French law. Since that stand against eBay, iBazar's fortunes waned as the internet sector has faded from favour. Early last year the company was valued at around \u20ac520m, five times what eBay seems prepared to pay for it. The company has been looking for a buyer for some time, and held talks with France T\u00e9l\u00e9com's Wanadoo internet service provider in late 2000. EBay has proved to be one of the few big winners in ecommerce. In its most recent quarter, to December 2000, eBay's gross margins topped 80%. Its revenues almost doubled last year. QXL and eBay have held talks over a possible merger but the US company balked at its British rival's multiple technology platforms and what some insiders said was its limited competitiveness.",

The German media company has agreed to inject capital if Napster switches to a \"subscription-based service\" paying royalties. Napster's legal team was led by David Boies, who fought unsuccessfully on behalf of Al Gore for recounts of the Florida presidential vote last year. He also acted - successfully - for the government in its anti-trust action against Microsoft. Napster was deluged by users at the weekend ahead of the court decision. Nearly 2m song files were traded on Sunday.",

It said the main reason for the decline was a sharp drop in petrol prices, although this was partly offset by higher food prices. </p> <p>The reduction came despite a higher than forecast increase in input prices, which rose by 0.5% in the month, lifting the annual growth rate to 6.3% from 5%. </p> <p>The figures were at odds with recent business surveys, suggesting manufacturers are becoming more confident about their ability to pass on price rises. </p> <p>However, Jonathan Loynes, chief UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said the data showed weakening world demand was thwarting those ambitions. </p> <p>\"Overall, the numbers support the generally very benign outlook for goods prices at the retail level. The idea that services inflation needs to slow sharply to accommodate goods inflation is looking weaker by the month.\" </p> <p>Figures out today are expected to show a further fall in the government's favoured measure of high-street inflation, excluding mortgage interest payments, which stand at 2%. </p> <p>With the Bank of England's monetary policy committee mandated to keep underlying inflation at 2.5%, most economists expected last week's quarter point cut in interest rates to 5.75% to be followed by another reduction soon to avoid a bigger undershoot of the target. </p> <p>But Michael Saunders, of Schroders SalomonSmith Barney, says no further economic stimulus will be needed.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Manufacturers slashed prices last month by the biggest amount for 15 years, despite a sharp increase in the cost of fuel and raw materials, implying a further squeeze on profit margins. The Office for National Statistics said the prices of goods at the factory gate fell by 0.4% in January, trimming the annual rate of inflation to 1.9% from 2.4% in December. It said the main reason for the decline was a sharp drop in petrol prices, although this was partly offset by higher food prices. The reduction came despite a higher than forecast increase in input prices, which rose by 0.5% in the month, lifting the annual growth rate to 6.3% from 5%. The figures were at odds with recent business surveys, suggesting manufacturers are becoming more confident about their ability to pass on price rises. However, Jonathan Loynes, chief UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said the data showed weakening world demand was thwarting those ambitions. \"Overall, the numbers support the generally very benign outlook for goods prices at the retail level. The idea that services inflation needs to slow sharply to accommodate goods inflation is looking weaker by the month.\" Figures out today are expected to show a further fall in the government's favoured measure of high-street inflation, excluding mortgage interest payments, which stand at 2%. With the Bank of England's monetary policy committee mandated to keep underlying inflation at 2.5%, most economists expected last week's quarter point cut in interest rates to 5.75% to be followed by another reduction soon to avoid a bigger undershoot of the target. But Michael Saunders, of Schroders SalomonSmith Barney, says no further economic stimulus will be needed.",

The vision of a \"broadband Britain\" championed by the government is looking increasingly unrealistic. The so-called unbundling of the local loop has stalled. No serious business plan can be drawn around the release of 25 exchanges in disparate areas at a time - the first tranche released by BT. And the costs associated with rivals going into a BT exchange still appear prohibitively high. BT, unlike operators abroad, is demanding that rivals' equipment be housed in separate rooms with separate entrances for instance. \"Broadband Britain\" is in crisis and the government and regulator Oftel need to act fast if they want to help the internet sector through its current turbulent period. It might be cyberspace, but real jobs, and with them Britain's competitive edge, are at risk here.",

      "bodyText": "\u0095 It's wonderful news that Paul O'Neill, George Bush's choice as US Treasury secretary, has sailed through his confirmation hearings. Let's hear no more nonsense about him being ignorant of Wall Street's workings or the rigours of modern finance. After all, running aluminium smelters (O'Neill's last job) is much like being in charge of the world's largest economy . . . isn't it? So ignore rumours suggesting O'Neill is merely a cipher given the job because he could twist the arm of his old pal Alan Greenspan to support Bush's tax-cutting bonanza - or that the real policy powerhouse will be Lawrence Lindsey, the former Federal Reserve governor who is certainly not waiting to get the 74-year-old Greenspan's job. One can tell O'Neill is a major player because of the quality of staff the administration is considering for him: on the list for press secretary is Tim Goeglein, a member of the swivel-eyed extreme right. Goeglein's credentials include being press adviser to Gary Bauer, the doomed right-wing loon who ran for the Republican nomination last year and who was so right wing that even Ron and Nancy Reagan used to tell him to calm down. \u0095 The world of hype is agog (one imagines) for the first release from the end product of the Popstars television series. The ITV proto-band's first single is not to be released until next month - and it would be a shame to spoil the build-up. Sadly, anyone with access to the Napster internet music sharing program can already download and hear the single: just search for Inner Spin (the band's new name) and the title, Pure and Simple. Better hurry, though, before a court in California declares the whole thing illegal. \u0095 The phones were out of order at Brunswick - the PR company that is to the City what lint is to pockets (annoying and hard to get rid of) - for most of yesterday. Net productivity in the City soared as a result. (If anyone at Cable &amp; Wireless fancies making \u00a350 in return for cutting them off again, give me a call.) \u0095 Clara Furse, the crazy, fun-lovin', wacky new head of the London stock exchange, says she's thinking about a new name for the poisoned chalice/venerable institution. What she's looking for is something that projects a forward-looking brand of dynamism. Something that is associated with global success and has strong European links. How about: Deutsche B\u00f6rse? \u0095 Animal cruelty is a terrible thing, of course, but one often has to be cruel to be kind. That's why City loft-style apartment dwellers will be keen to snap up the Bonzai Kitten, now available over the internet (www.bonzaikitten.com), where specially raised cats are kept in jars during their early growth phase to ensure they remain cute and cuddly right into adulthood. \"The flexibility of the kitten's skeleton means that if the bones are gently warped at this early age,\" reads the website, \"they can be molded into any desired shape.\" It is of course a spoof run by students at MIT in Boston, but (according to Wired magazine) the FBI has fallen for it and have presented the university with a grand jury subpoena demanding information about who runs the site. richard.adams@theguardian.com",

The grounds, in the courtyard of St Giles's church, Covent Garden, are a haven for drug addicts who hide in the bushes to shoot up.</p> <p>It was here that 12-year-old Diego Piniero-Villar befriended Edward Alexander Crowley, a drifter four times his age, nearly two years ago.</p> <p>According to Diego's mother, her son took pity on Crowley, 52, when other children started throwing stones at him. It was a kindness which cost him his life.</p> <p>Diego could not have known the scruffy man carrying a plastic bag had a long history of mental illness and that he had developed an obsession with the occult.</p> <p>Crowley's and Diego's relationship started with conversations by the swings and trips to play games at a local arcade, and were followed with visits to the swimming baths. Crowley bought Diego gifts and treats such as hamburgers, and for a while the schoolboy seemed flattered by the attention.</p> <p>Police have never found any evidence that Crowley abused Diego, but the relationship was uncomfortably physical; it involved play-fights in which Crowley licked his ear and tickled his navel.</p> <p>Diego appears to have kept their friendship a secret until the summer of 1999, when his mother became suspicious and contacted police. Officers were already on the case. Crowley had come to their attention in June that year, when residents reported seeing him approach children at Phoenix gardens.</p> <p>In September 1999, Crowley went to Holborn police station to confess he was having a relationship with a 12-year-old boy, which he described as \"loving but not primarily sexual\". He then retracted the claim.</p> <p>The subsequent investigation disturbed officers; a psychiatric nurse concluded Crowley was \"a definite risk to young boys\", and Diego's mother told them she had received calls from an anonymous man asking for her son.

      "bodyText": "A row of dilapidated swings is the only sign that Phoenix gardens in central London was intended as a children's playground. The grounds, in the courtyard of St Giles's church, Covent Garden, are a haven for drug addicts who hide in the bushes to shoot up. It was here that 12-year-old Diego Piniero-Villar befriended Edward Alexander Crowley, a drifter four times his age, nearly two years ago. According to Diego's mother, her son took pity on Crowley, 52, when other children started throwing stones at him. It was a kindness which cost him his life. Diego could not have known the scruffy man carrying a plastic bag had a long history of mental illness and that he had developed an obsession with the occult. Crowley's and Diego's relationship started with conversations by the swings and trips to play games at a local arcade, and were followed with visits to the swimming baths. Crowley bought Diego gifts and treats such as hamburgers, and for a while the schoolboy seemed flattered by the attention. Police have never found any evidence that Crowley abused Diego, but the relationship was uncomfortably physical; it involved play-fights in which Crowley licked his ear and tickled his navel. Diego appears to have kept their friendship a secret until the summer of 1999, when his mother became suspicious and contacted police. Officers were already on the case. Crowley had come to their attention in June that year, when residents reported seeing him approach children at Phoenix gardens. In September 1999, Crowley went to Holborn police station to confess he was having a relationship with a 12-year-old boy, which he described as \"loving but not primarily sexual\". He then retracted the claim. The subsequent investigation disturbed officers; a psychiatric nurse concluded Crowley was \"a definite risk to young boys\", and Diego's mother told them she had received calls from an anonymous man asking for her son. The boy, who by this time was unhappy with Crowley's attentions, was interviewed but gave no evidence of sexual abuse. When detectives went to Phoenix gardens, they found messages painted with correction fluid on the swing seats. \"I will always love you, Diego,\" stated one. \"Please forgive me for everything. I couldn't stand the pain. One day you'll know how much you hurt me. How much I need you.\" Another, dated November 2 1999, read: \"Always cheat others before they cheat you - if they are clever enough. I wasn't and I wouldn't want to be.\" It was addressed to \"Bravo, mi chico Latino\". Crowley was arrested on November 3 on suspicion of indecently assaulting Diego, but released almost immediately for lack of evidence. Crowley was not put off. On December 6, he went to Canada Blanch, the independent school Diego attended in west London, and painted in Spanish and English, this message across three doors. \"Why did you cheat me Diego? Why all the lies? I should hate you but I don't. Alex.\" He was arrested outside the school, and appeared before Marylebone magistrates the following day to plead guilty to causing criminal damage. He was given a two-year conditional discharge and released back on the streets. Diego was clearly at risk. He was given a police mobile phone, enabling him to dial 999. Patrols around the school were stepped up and his step-father Juan Fernandez began escorting him to west London. A few days later, Crowley was charged with harassment and remanded in custody by Highbury magistrates for mental health assessment. According to Camden council, a forensic psychiatrist who saw Crowley in prison concluded he was \"dangerous and should be detained\". On March 20, three and a half months after his arrest, the CPS went back to magistrates and admitted the case was not ready to go to crown court for trial. Despite the objections of the police, district judge Dorothy Quick granted Crowley bail on strict conditions. A charge of gross indecency was dropped a week later. Crowley was ordered not to contact Diego, attend the boy's home or school, or go to Phoenix gardens. He was also to report daily at a police station, though this was relaxed after two weeks. Neither the police nor social services knew where he was. Crowley was not on medication and he was not under supervision from social services. Mentally unstable and bearing a grudge which had festered in prison over 14 weeks, Crowley sought revenge. On the evening of May 7, Diego's stepfather asked Diego and his stepbrother Roberto, 15, to run an errand. As they passed Phoenix gardens at 8pm, they were confronted by Crowley, who was armed with a kitchen knife. He slashed the older boy, then turned on Diego, who managed to dial 999 on his mobile phone. The operator only heard his screams as he was stabbed more than 20 times. Diego was pronounced dead on arrival at St Thomas's hospital. After the murder, police began to unravel Crowley's past and his fascination with the occult. They discovered his name was not Crowley. He was born Henry Allen Bibby in Middlesbrough in 1948, and had spent most of his adult life jobless and drifting. His medical records showed he had tried to commit suicide by drugs overdose on at least seven occasions. His fascination with the occult can be traced from 1998, when he changed his name by deed poll to Edward Alexander Crowley, apparently in honour of the black arts magician Aleister Crowley, who styled himself \"the wickedest man alive\" and \"the Beast\". Aleister Crowley was born Edward Alexander Crowley and he died in 1947. On one of the websites dedicated to the magician, police found the quote: \"A male child of perfect innocence and high intelligence is the most satisfactory and suitable victim.\" When Crowley was arrested after the murder, police officers found in his bag a piece of folded paper covered in references to child sacrifice in religion, black magic and classical myth. The Latin words \"Delendus est D.Piniero - \"Piniero must be destroyed\" - were at the top of the page.",

It is very unusual for sufferers to become violent, according to Richard Mills of the National Autistic Society.</p> <p>Young children with the syndrome may become upset by sudden changes to routine and adults could become extremely anxious by an unexpected delay, such as a traffic jam.</p> <p>Sufferers are exceptionally sensitive to the difference between right and wrong and are usually extremely law abiding.</p> <p>Asperger's syndrome is a neuro-biological condition named after Hans Asperger, the Austrian paediatrician who first recognised it in the 1940s. Twenty years ago it was virtually unheard of, but now experts believe it is widespread and may affect between one in 100 and one in 2,000 people.</p> <p>There is evidence of a genetic component in a complex neurological condition with multiple causes. People with the condition display impairments, also present in autism, which affect behaviour, communication and imagination.</p> <p>People with the syndrome are often high achievers. They find socialising and small talk difficult, though they are good at absorbing facts. They find it hard to glean what others are thinking, can focus for long periods and have unusually strong, narrow interests.</p>",

Three psychiatrists who examined the boy decided that he had Asperger's syndrome. \"The family was permanently on the move,\" she added. \"By any standards his existence was wretched.\" Mr Justice Toulson adjourned sentence while suitable secure accommodation was found for the boy. He told him: \"You killed your baby brother in a terrible fit of violence. What caused you to behave this way lies inside you - you are very disturbed.\" At an earlier hearing the judge described the boy as having an unfortunate and genuine history of adverse psycho-socio factors. David Archer, chief crown prosecutor for Avon and Somerset, said they decided to accept the boy's plea of guilty to manslaughter rather than proceed with a murder trial. He said it was unlikely that the boy would have been well enough to face such a trial for many months or years and such a course would have breached his human rights. Detective Chief Inspector Paul Moody, of Avon and Somerset police, described it as a tragic case for everyone concerned. \"Officers have been offered counselling and have worked closely with the family. Our thoughts go out to them,\" he said. Social services in Bristol said an investigation was under way to see if any agency involved could have averted the tragedy. They were working with the family at the time, but the child had given no earlier cause for concern. Asperger's sufferers obsessive about sticking to routines Asperger's syndrome is a mild form of autism which affects up to 200,000 people in the UK. It is very unusual for sufferers to become violent, according to Richard Mills of the National Autistic Society. Young children with the syndrome may become upset by sudden changes to routine and adults could become extremely anxious by an unexpected delay, such as a traffic jam. Sufferers are exceptionally sensitive to the difference between right and wrong and are usually extremely law abiding. Asperger's syndrome is a neuro-biological condition named after Hans Asperger, the Austrian paediatrician who first recognised it in the 1940s. Twenty years ago it was virtually unheard of, but now experts believe it is widespread and may affect between one in 100 and one in 2,000 people. There is evidence of a genetic component in a complex neurological condition with multiple causes. People with the condition display impairments, also present in autism, which affect behaviour, communication and imagination. People with the syndrome are often high achievers. They find socialising and small talk difficult, though they are good at absorbing facts. They find it hard to glean what others are thinking, can focus for long periods and have unusually strong, narrow interests.",

      "body": "<p>How would you feel if you knew the government was responsible for murdering a member of your family? Would you do anything about it? Would you just get on with things as best you could and try not to think about it, or would you spend years struggling to get enough worldwide support to make the government at least admit what it did?</p> <p>My father, Patrick, was a practising solicitor in Northern Ireland for 11 years before he was murdered, and I believe the British government was responsible. On Sunday February 12 1989, armed gunmen broke into my family home, ran to the kitchen where we were eating dinner, and shot my dad 14 times in front of my mother, my sister and brother.</p> <p>I can still remember it clearly. It is an image seared into my mind. The thing I remember most vividly is the noise; the reports of each bullet reverberating in the kitchen, how my grip on my younger brother and sister tightened with every shot. It's not a memory I care to visit very often, but it's there. I expect it always will be.</p> <p>Throughout his career, my father was the subject of intimidation and harassment from RUC officers. Detectives made threats, communicated to him by clients he represented. They began as snide comments about his legal ability or general personal insults, but escalated before long into death threats.</p> <p>A typical example was: \"He is a thug in a suit, a person trying to let on he is doing his job, and ... he, like every other fenian [Catholic] bastard, would meet his end.\" The detective continued, \"He is a dead man. He'll be dead within three months.\"</p> <p>The officer proved right. Not long after, Douglas Hogg, then a junior Home Office minister, said during a Commons debate on January 17 1989: \"I have to state as a fact, but with great regret, that there are in Northern Ireland a number of solicitors who are unduly sympathetic to the cause of the IRA.\"</p> <p>Seamus Mallon MP (now deputy first minister of the Northern Ireland assembly) realised immediately the potential consequences. When challenged by him, Hogg replied, \"I state it on the basis of advice that I have received, guidance that I have been given by people who are dealing with these matters, and I shall not expand on it further.\"</p> <p>The \"people dealing with these matters\" were the RUC. They had given this information to Hogg at a private briefing. Given his position at the time, what he said can only be viewed as a British government statement. In the intense atmosphere of Northern Ireland his comments were perceived as highly inflammatory, and perhaps that is exactly what they intended.</p> <p>The RUC were well placed to know. One of their informants was a member of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA), the loyalist gang that carried out my father's murder. William Stobie was eventually arrested for the murder in 1999, but he said: \"Not guilty of the charge that you have put to me tonight. At the time I was a police informer for Special Branch. On the night of the death of Patrick Finucane I informed special branch on two occasions by telephone of a person who was to be shot.\" Despite the warning, the RUC had done nothing.</p> <p>Stobie had already been questioned about the murder back in 1990 and gave a detailed account of his involvement to the RUC at that time. It was decided not to prosecute him. During the current case against Stobie, a lawyer for the crown said in court that that decision by the DPP had been taken \"at the highest level\".</p> <p>But the RUC may even have played a lesser role compared to the involvement of the army. A secret branch of army intelligence services, the force research unit (FRU) was infiltrating agents into loyalist paramilitary groups in order to control and direct their killings. FRU was established in 1982. Its purpose, according to its former commander, Col Gordon Kerr, was \"in order that we can save life, that we can prevent attacks taking place, that we can prevent assassinations, that we can make arrests, that we can get recoveries of weapons and explosives ...\"</p> <p>FRU's agent in the group that murdered my father was named Brian Nelson. One of the first thing his handlers did after his infiltration in 1987 was to take away all his files and return them fully updated. This was easy: they were able to make use of all of the state's intelligence when doing so. Nelson, assisted by updated intelligence information, provided the UDA with method and means to carry out murders, selected specific targets, and guided the trigger men accordingly. Nelson himself has said information he was given included British army documents and photographs.</p> <p>Former FRU soldiers and officials (including the former Northern Ireland secretary, Tom King) have maintained the falsehood about the purpose of the FRU. However, confidential FRU files that have made their way into the public domain paint a different picture. One document dated May 3 1988, states: \"6137 [Nelson] wants the UDA only to attack legitimate targets and not innocent Catholics. Since 6137 took up his position as intelligence officer, the targeting has developed and is now more professional.\"</p> <p>Another, dated February 6 1989, states: \"6137 initiates most of the targeting. Of late, 6137 has been more organised and he is currently running an operation against selected republican targets.\" Six days later, my father was murdered.</p> <p>What FRU were doing was carrying out a government policy that authorised the use of the army to direct assassinations. They had a job to do, and they did it. One former officer, known by the pseudonym \"Martin Ingram\" says the work of FRU was highly organised and controlled. In a Belfast newspaper, he wrote: \"I was told on more than one occasion 'the ends justified the means' and the 'right' people were allowed to live and the 'wrong' people were not. The practice of presiding as a judge, jury and executioner is wrong and regrettably I cannot say the mindset of some individuals has changed to this day.\"</p> <p>Brian Nelson was eventually arrested by a team of detectives investigating RUC collusion with loyalists, led by Sir John Stevens, (now commissioner of the Metropolitan police). Nelson received a 10-year sentence on 23 charges ranging from conspiracy to murder (my father's murder was not one of them) to collecting information for terrorist purposes. He served four and a half. Colonel Gordon Kerr was awarded a military OBE in 1991. He is currently the British military attache to Beijing.</p> <p>To dwell on the role of people like Brian Nelson and Martin Ingram is to miss the point as to why Patrick Finucane was murdered. It happened because he was a determined and innovative lawyer, and not, as the RUC and others claim, because he was involved in paramilitary activity. Both the RUC and the British government had a powerful motivation. He was among the first to bring the RUC and the army to court when they broke the law. He was among the first to successfully take the government to the European court of human rights over its practices in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>He was among the first to use the law to show that even in a situation of conflict, the law still applies. It is because he was prepared to do all of this that he became the first solicitor to be murdered.When the British government had to decide between preserving the status quo and putting up with some uppity Catholic lawyer, the choice was simple: the lawyer had to go.</p> <p>My family does not regard the prosecution of the killers as the main concern in all of this. They were simply pawns in a bigger game. Our goal is a public, independent international inquiry into all the circumstances. We have gained the support of the UN, the US Congress, the Irish government, the European parliament, and others.</p> <p>We are supported by every major human rights organisation in the world, from Amnesty International to the International Federation of Human Rights. The notable absentee is the British government, and it is there that ultimate responsibility lies.</p> <p>The state machinery that murdered Patrick Finucane was not established to kill one man. Others died too, and the question that has to be answered is, how many? It was this point that my family urged upon the prime minister at a private meeting last September. A third police investigation by Sir John Stevens - the prime minister's preferred option - will simply not do.</p> <p>Many people who still live in Northern Ireland were unaware of how precarious their existence was, and did not realise that for many years each of them was considered expendable. But they are aware of it now and they want to know the truth. How will the peace process ever succeed if it is kept hidden? Tony Blair's administration may not have been responsible for what took place but, by frustrating a proper inquiry, it has become part of the problem.</p> <p>It has taken 12 years to uncover what you have just read. Instead of devoting resources toward the search for a peaceful solution, the government was obsessed with securing the defeat of republican paramilitaries, whatever the cost. They armed and assisted loyalists in order to do so. One line after another was crossed and, eventually, the line between right and wrong disappeared completely. Neither the law of the land nor human life itself was respected. This was your government's policy. If it had happened in Britain, there would be an outcry. But it happened in Northern Ireland, so no one cared.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "After the calm of her longest night's sleep for three months, Ellen MacArthur emerged yesterday into a storm of publicity that is likely to follow her for a while longer than it took to circumnavigate the globe. Wearing civvies for the first time in 96 days and looking rested after the luxury of three hours' unbroken sleep, MacArthur faced the ravenous press corps and spoke of her achievement in becoming the youngest person to complete the trip single handed. Demonstrating the passion for competition that sustained her extraordinary voyage, she insisted she would make the trip again. \"If there was another start tomorrow then there is a high chance I would be there,\" she said. As it is she will wait only a matter of months before returning to ocean racing. \"I'm going to stay with Kingfisher and do the Atlantic Challenge with her, fully crewed. After spending three months alone on her it will be strange getting used to sailing with other people.\" MacArthur began sailing at the age of eight and at 24 is already regarded as the finest sailor the UK has produced. She said the gruelling Vendee Globe, in which she finished second, was the culmination of a decade of effort. \"When I see the fame and the glory, the flares of last night, it's very easy to forget the past and everything I have come through,\" she said. \"The biggest thing to learn is that if you have a dream you can achieve it. Ten years ago it was a dream to do this race. Believe you can do it and have the determination. I have just followed a dream and not thought about the fact that I am a girl and younger than a lot of the other people. \"I don't feel like a heroine and I don't feel famous, I just feel like people want to hear the story and I feel grateful that people have shared the race and that people have been interested in it.\" She added: \"I get this masochistic pleasure out of these things, out of finding my limit and then pushing myself beyond it. Somebody sent me an email. It said 'courage is not having the energy to go on. It's going on when you do not have the energy.' That's true.\" Reflecting on her rapturous landfall on Sunday evening when 200,000 people lined the harbourside at Les Sables D'Olonne on the Bay of Biscay, she said: \"Last night was a mix of emotions: almost a dread of finishing the race because I was so happy out there, but also the elation of finishing and coming back to the welcome of literally hundreds of thousands of people. It's hard to describe just how that felt. \"It seems very strange not to be thinking what the wind is doing or thinking about logging on and looking at the weather. All that is just a little world that has been turning for the past three months and all of a sudden it stops and I'm just standing here. \"I've got no money, no credit cards, no mobile phone, no nothing. It's just Ellen and it's going to take me a while to get back to normal.\" Normality may be some way off but money should not be a problem. MacArthur's business partner and former rival Mark Turner had been besieged by requests for her time and publishers are circling, offering \u00a3100,000 for the rights to a book. \"It's been a very hectic few days. Awesome,\" he said. \"The interest outside France is unbelievable and I don't just mean in Britain. Today I've had interview requests from Germany, Italy, Spain, Poland and Sweden,\" he said, looking more tired than his partner. \"I've to get back to CBS in America very soon. And the interest in Australia and New Zealand is incredible.\" MacArthur said: \"There is no doubt about it. I would not be sitting here now without him.\" The BBC has already commissioned a programme on MacArthur's journey using footage from four cameras installed on the boat and she has been approached to endorse products from clothing to cars. MacArthur will return to Derbyshire with her parents, Ken and Avril, in the next few days, but said she wanted to stay in France to see some of the Vendee competitors finish the race. Another 14 boats are still at sea.

      "bodyText": "Britain's environmental credentials were yesterday ripped to shreds by the European commission, which accused the government of sacrificing endangered species to the demands of developers. In a damning statement the commission said it was taking legal action against the UK in the European court of justice because the government paid scant attention to environmentally important areas when granting planning permission, and did far too little to save the often fragile habitats of endangered species. The commission cited damage to breeding and resting sites used by otters, great crested newts and all species of bat. Under the European Union's habitats directive, the most important piece of wildlife legislation agreed by EU member states, the government is allowed to grant exceptions to protection if it believes \"there are imperative reasons and an overriding case to do so\". However, the commission stated that the government was hardly bothering to enforce the directive, and granting exceptions to almost anyone who asked. It said: \"Licences seem to be issued as a formality after development consent for a construction or infrastructure project has already been given, and do not appear to involve a careful weighting of the arguments for and against allowing damage to occur.\" Such strong criticism from Brussels and the prospect of a high profile court case in Europe that could lead to a huge fine is potentially highly damaging to Tony Blair, who is keen to be seen as environmentally aware. The EU's environment commissioner, Margot Wallstrom, warned the government last night: \"We must take our legal safeguards seriously, or we face the wiping out of endangered species through the creeping loss of habitats.\" Her office in Brussels said it believed the only valid reason for granting an exception to the directive was where there was no satisfactory alternative to a specific construction project, and it stressed that exceptions should not be the rule. The government has two months to convince the commission that it is no longer in breach of the directive, otherwise the case goes to the court in Luxembourg. Last night the Department of Environment confessed that it was \"disappointed\" by the commission's action, and was urgently reviewing its procedures to avoid prosecution. A spokeswoman said the department thought it had done enough last March, after being warned it was breaching EU law, and tightened the rules to prevent destruction of sites where rare species \"bred or rested\".

Luisa Ejercito's decision to join the race adds to Mr Estrada's personal stake in the general elections on May 14, which are widely regarded as a referendum on the revolt that toppled him last month. 1.3m trees to fall in Portugal Workers will start felling 1.3m trees this month to clear land for a huge reservoir in Portugal which is billed as Europe's largest man-made lake, and is opposed by environmentalists. The lake will extend 50 miles into the rural Alentejo region of south-eastern Portugal.",

It will look at the roles played by police, the crown prosecution service and the social services. </p> <p>Crowley is not thought to have sexually abused Diego, but this will be looked at in the inquiry by a forensic psychologist and a former civil servant. </p> <p>Neither the CPS nor the police has explained why it took so long to conclude the investigation of the harassment of the boy. \"Crowley had been charged with harassment, but the custody time limit ran out,\" said a CPS source. </p> <p>\"The police needed more time to gather evidence. It's not right to say the case had been dropped. </p> <p>\"Once he was out on bail there was no way of forcing him to have further psychiatric assessments. </p> <p>Crowley seems to have benefited from a loophole in the Mental Health Act that distinguishes between the care of people diagnosed with personality disorders and the care of people who are deemed psychotic. </p> <p>While on remand, he was assessed by a forensic psychiatrist who concluded that he \"has a personality disorder and is dangerous ... he should be detained\". </p> <p>However, the law states that a personality disorder is untreatable, and that sufferers cannot be compelled to have treatment. </p> <p>\"We offered him help before his arrest, during his time in custody, and after his arrest,\" said a spokesman for Camden social services. \"He refused us every time. We could not legally force him to have treatment and he was adamant that he didn't want it. </p> <p>\"This is a problem area, and one that needs to be addressed with changes to the law.\" </p> <p>Camden said it first learned of concerns about Crowley at a case conference on Diego held with the police in autumn 1999. </p> <p>The drifter was not on the sex offenders register - he had no paedophile convictions - and he had not been referred to the council for treatment. </p> <p>\"The police told us about the stalking, but it was decided they should take responsibility for protecting the boy. They were quite happy to do so. There didn't seem to be real concern that he was in genuine danger at that point.\" </p> <p>The report from the forensic psychiatrist who concluded Crowley was \"dangerous and should be detained\" was presented to court at a bail hearing last March when he was released from custody. </p> <p>\"Our advice was, unfortunately, not taken by the magistrate,\" said the council spokesman. </p> <p>After his arrest for murder, Crowley's mental health history was reviewed by a psychiatrist who decided that he had been suffering from paranoid schizophrenia since the 1970s. </p> <p>Crowley continues to deny that he is mentally ill - claiming he \"fabricated symptoms\" when assessed - and has asked to be sent to prison rather than to a secure psychiatric hospital. </p> <p>The government is proposing to close the loophole in mental health legislation to make it possible to treat people with severe mental health disorder \"either in their own best interests or to protect the wider public\". But the proposals, published as a white paper in December, are unlikely to become law in this parliament. </p> <p>Michael Howlett, director of the Zito Trust, said yesterday: \"I think it is absolutely inexcusable that this tragedy was allowed to happen. It's pretty clear to me that this should have been picked up. </p> <p>\"We're talking about a young boy losing his life to somebody who has got this kind of history and is already going through the system. </p> <p>\"The government has told us that there are 400-500 people in the community with dangerous, severe personality disorders.\"</p>",

It will look at the roles played by police, the crown prosecution service and the social services. Crowley is not thought to have sexually abused Diego, but this will be looked at in the inquiry by a forensic psychologist and a former civil servant. Neither the CPS nor the police has explained why it took so long to conclude the investigation of the harassment of the boy. \"Crowley had been charged with harassment, but the custody time limit ran out,\" said a CPS source. \"The police needed more time to gather evidence. It's not right to say the case had been dropped. \"Once he was out on bail there was no way of forcing him to have further psychiatric assessments. Crowley seems to have benefited from a loophole in the Mental Health Act that distinguishes between the care of people diagnosed with personality disorders and the care of people who are deemed psychotic. While on remand, he was assessed by a forensic psychiatrist who concluded that he \"has a personality disorder and is dangerous ... he should be detained\". However, the law states that a personality disorder is untreatable, and that sufferers cannot be compelled to have treatment. \"We offered him help before his arrest, during his time in custody, and after his arrest,\" said a spokesman for Camden social services. \"He refused us every time. We could not legally force him to have treatment and he was adamant that he didn't want it. \"This is a problem area, and one that needs to be addressed with changes to the law.\" Camden said it first learned of concerns about Crowley at a case conference on Diego held with the police in autumn 1999. The drifter was not on the sex offenders register - he had no paedophile convictions - and he had not been referred to the council for treatment. \"The police told us about the stalking, but it was decided they should take responsibility for protecting the boy. They were quite happy to do so. There didn't seem to be real concern that he was in genuine danger at that point.\" The report from the forensic psychiatrist who concluded Crowley was \"dangerous and should be detained\" was presented to court at a bail hearing last March when he was released from custody. \"Our advice was, unfortunately, not taken by the magistrate,\" said the council spokesman. After his arrest for murder, Crowley's mental health history was reviewed by a psychiatrist who decided that he had been suffering from paranoid schizophrenia since the 1970s. Crowley continues to deny that he is mentally ill - claiming he \"fabricated symptoms\" when assessed - and has asked to be sent to prison rather than to a secure psychiatric hospital. The government is proposing to close the loophole in mental health legislation to make it possible to treat people with severe mental health disorder \"either in their own best interests or to protect the wider public\". But the proposals, published as a white paper in December, are unlikely to become law in this parliament. Michael Howlett, director of the Zito Trust, said yesterday: \"I think it is absolutely inexcusable that this tragedy was allowed to happen. It's pretty clear to me that this should have been picked up. \"We're talking about a young boy losing his life to somebody who has got this kind of history and is already going through the system. \"The government has told us that there are 400-500 people in the community with dangerous, severe personality disorders.\"",

The tendency has Thatcherite origins, from a time when the personal familiars of the leader began to weaken the influence of the professional civil service. Mrs Thatcher never did think much of Whitehall . Under Blair, the eclipse of the mandarins at the centre of government is more pronounced.

Nonetheless, he should have done more to insist on the observance of a system and process which are in his stewardship.</p> <p>That he didn't take that seriously enough may have had something to do with where he came from. As the former boss of the Home Office, he seems to have believed what Home Office officials reported about what happened, via Mandelson, in 1998. In a very short time, without assembling all the evidence, he was hustled into lending the weight of his once-great office to the condign verdict against the minister.</p> <p>Since then, the suspicion has grown that Home Office officials were allowing a miasma of rumour and half- remembered suspicion to congeal into \"fact\". Other versions were not tested. Perhaps not surprisingly, the latest word is that Wilson is seeking to distance himself from the events of the last week in January, hinting that Downing Street had more to do with them than he did.</p> <p>That's not the only word emerging from the turmoil. After a week of slagging Mandelson off, No 10 now calls for calm and says he should be allowed to defend himself. It's obvious what's happening. Belatedly, the official machine feels the need to prepare itself for the possibility that Hammond will not find its conduct in all respects justifiable. The murmur of preparatory damage limitation shimmers round the system, both in particular, as regards the cabinet secretary, and in general on behalf of the Downing Street apparatus.</p> <p>Hammond is inquiring only into the events of 1998, and the bearing these have on a single sequence of remarks allegedly made by Mandelson in recent weeks. Maybe the investigation will find conclusive proof, that a) he intervened to influence a Hinduja passport application and b) he told, in Jack Straw's word, an \"untruth\" about that recently.</p> <p>Or maybe not. Though Hammond himself is a former Home Office man, he'll be aware that public scrutiny of his account and its supporting evidence will be intense. He won't get away with any kind of fiddle. More likely, he will be able to point to no more than a series of cock-ups unverifiable as evidence of personal guilt.</p> <p>On the other hand, Hammond won't be looking at the whole of what happened early in 2001. This is a very big pity. As regards our system of government, Mandelson's (at worst) slender intervention in 1998, if it was made at all, is far less worrying than the hysteria that gripped the prime minister's office on January 29. That is the political moment that needs taking apart.</p> <p>Not only did it destroy a minister who will probably turn out not to have done anything bad enough to deserve such a fate. It also exposed a system of politics that has broken the rules of orderly government, with the connivance of the official who was once the guarantor of those rules, the great umpire who protected the basic ethics of government. The cabinet secretary has been brought very low when he can't remind the prime minister of the prudence, let alone the morality, of not panicking. If they both pay a price for Mandelson's political corpse, they'll deserve it.</p> <p>\u0095 Oliver James is a clinical psychologist and not, as we suggested in a piece headed The decline and fall of the august cabinet secretary, Comment, page 20, February 13, a psychiatrist.</p>",

That's not the only word emerging from the turmoil. After a week of slagging Mandelson off, No 10 now calls for calm and says he should be allowed to defend himself. It's obvious what's happening. Belatedly, the official machine feels the need to prepare itself for the possibility that Hammond will not find its conduct in all respects justifiable. The murmur of preparatory damage limitation shimmers round the system, both in particular, as regards the cabinet secretary, and in general on behalf of the Downing Street apparatus. Hammond is inquiring only into the events of 1998, and the bearing these have on a single sequence of remarks allegedly made by Mandelson in recent weeks. Maybe the investigation will find conclusive proof, that a) he intervened to influence a Hinduja passport application and b) he told, in Jack Straw's word, an \"untruth\" about that recently. Or maybe not. Though Hammond himself is a former Home Office man, he'll be aware that public scrutiny of his account and its supporting evidence will be intense. He won't get away with any kind of fiddle. More likely, he will be able to point to no more than a series of cock-ups unverifiable as evidence of personal guilt. On the other hand, Hammond won't be looking at the whole of what happened early in 2001. This is a very big pity. As regards our system of government, Mandelson's (at worst) slender intervention in 1998, if it was made at all, is far less worrying than the hysteria that gripped the prime minister's office on January 29. That is the political moment that needs taking apart. Not only did it destroy a minister who will probably turn out not to have done anything bad enough to deserve such a fate. It also exposed a system of politics that has broken the rules of orderly government, with the connivance of the official who was once the guarantor of those rules, the great umpire who protected the basic ethics of government. The cabinet secretary has been brought very low when he can't remind the prime minister of the prudence, let alone the morality, of not panicking. If they both pay a price for Mandelson's political corpse, they'll deserve it. \u0095 Oliver James is a clinical psychologist and not, as we suggested in a piece headed The decline and fall of the august cabinet secretary, Comment, page 20, February 13, a psychiatrist.",

Fans who took a liking to his street smart style, his gracefully deadpan confidence and deft dancing will be grateful to see his name on the ROH guest list this year. Especially since he is dancing the repertory's most sweetly laddish hero, Colas, in Frederick Ashton's La Fille mal gard\u00e9e. And even more especially since his Lise is Sarah Wildor. </p> <p>They make, as Lise's mum is forced to admit, a lovely pair. Stiefel is cast in neither a heroic nor dramatic mode, being slender, fast, decisive and with an askance sense of mischief (think Carter in ER). With his clipped, efficient power he dances like an American but he pays lots of willing attention to the English details of the choreography - the witty flourishes of the head and the largesse of the arms - and he is flirtatiously alert to everyone else on stage. </p> <p>Wildor has always been lovely in Ashton roles, with a natural responsiveness to the choreographer's musical exuberance and an open, generous manner that chimes with his emotional transparency. Her Lise is as droll, pretty and vivacious as any faux 18th-century heroine ought to be but she has so much genuine fun with the role that it doesn't seem like a period piece. We laugh out loud at her jokes and believe absolutely in her physical and romantic adoration for Colas. </p> <p>But, even as we're seduced by Wildor's charm, we also note the intelligence of the choices she's making as she dances, choices that, paradoxically, make it look as if she is performing the role for the first time. We note the brief challenging look she slips over her shoulder at Colas, then the second, longer, greedier gaze that tells us she cannot wait to fall into his arms. We note the tiny pause she holds before arching her back against his embrace, registering with decorous but unequivocal intent the erotic intensity of the moment. </p> <p>The Saturday matin\u00e9e show in which Wildor and Stiefel danced was packed with kids and while they were giggling enthusiastically at the lovers' jokes, the parents were melting in their seats. </p> <p>William Tuckett, dancing Widow Simone, packs the role too full of effects to make Lise's mum as consistent a character as her daughter. Tuckett can't make up his mind whether to play a pantomime dame or a mother torn between the desire to marry her daughter off for cash or let her follow her heart. But all of his stagey business is carried off in high style and the cosy nonsense that Simone and Lise enjoy together alone is infused with a powerful bond between mother and daughter.

The Mark Baldwin Dance Company will introduce the stage version in High Wycombe tomorrow; Sinfonia 21 and the conductor Martyn Brabbins presented the concert premiere in Imperial College's Great Hall last Friday. The inspiration was Jean Cocteau's film Orph\u00e9e; a series of mysterious phrases announced on a car radio punctuate the narrative and Anderson has taken four of those seraphic messages as the titles of his four movements. But each movement makes perfect sense without any knowledge of its provenance; Anderson's deftness and vivid aural imagination make sure of that. The first movement, The World Illuminated by a Single Glass of Water, for instance, uses just one melody, heard three times in ever lower registers and differently coloured and harmonised as it descends. Everything is gorgeously coloured, every melody has elegance and purpose. Anderson has produced a beautifully proportioned, attractive piece that puts a chamber orchestra expertly through its paces; Sinfonia 21's performance was immensely accomplished and now the dance takes over. \u0095 The Mark Baldwin Dance Company gives the stage premiere of The Bird Sings with its Fingers at the Wycombe Swan (01494 512000) tomorrow.",

We could be on a rollercoaster, such is the adrenaline rush her performance induces. She ends the song yelling the chilling demand, \"Lick my legs, I'm on fire\" over the audience's cheers. It's one of those life-affirming moments to remind you why live music is unbeatably thrilling. </p> <p>If the rest of the show doesn't quite live up to its incredible beginning, it's down to one thing only: Polly keeps putting down her guitar. It's not that her other two guitarists are inadequate - their sound is fearsome, cavernous, graceful - or that her jittery dancing isn't enjoyable to watch. It's just that she looks so sexy with a guitar, projects such confidence. When she stamps a twinkling foot in strappy four-inch heels on her effects pedal, it's unspeakably provocative. When she stands centre stage in the classic rock pose, shoulders back, pelvis thrust forward, lovingly wrenching those six strings, she challenges you to count her the equal of all those male axe heroes. </p> <p>Of course, Harvey is playing up to stereotypes even as she demolishes them. She knows, for instance, that the men in the audience aren't quite as riveted by the pink cowboy hat, leopard-print platform shoes and furious playing of her band's second guitarist, Laika's Margaret Fiedler. But at least when Harvey plays, she becomes singularly inspiring. When she dances, she is more ordinary, more like other female singers, looking good for the boys. </p> <p>These are thoughts to fill you with guilt, because Harvey looks so content, happy not to be shackled by her guitar, to be able to do little cha-cha-cha moves with her feet and twirl her arms. Particularly on the more visceral tracks from last year's album Songs from the City, Songs from the Sea, she prefers to be the calm centre of her music's maelstrom, nonchalant with a pair of maracas. </p> <p>Big Exit and Kamikaze, enormous on record, here grow bigger still, detonating rhythms, churning out energy. When Fiedler's effects pedals momentarily stop working you realise how pristine the sound is. For these songs Harvey makes her voice sound metallic, rusty and scratchy; elsewhere, what you appreciate is the clarity of her voice, its beauty. She sings This Mess We're In and it's earthy, seductive, quite unlike Thom Yorke's eerie wails on record. There are hints of Patti Smith, but they don't detract from Harvey's own strength. </p> <p>Despite the misgivings, it's a superb show, one to make you leave the venue feeling inches taller. Harvey is one of the most compelling songwriters around, and her set, spanning her career from 1992's Sheela-na-gig to the present, shows she's only getting better. </p> <p>\u0095 At the Shepherds Bush Empire, London W12 (020-7771 2000), tonight.</p>",
