      "body": "<p>'W e don't need no education, We don't need no thought control.' Pink Floyd's social comment is an ironic anthem for the schooled classes; the bars of Oxbridge colleges still reverberate to its beat. </p> <p>The message was ahead of its time. The needs of the economy have changed dramatically, but the education system is stuck in the past. While employers cry out for post-industrial workers, schools are run on strictly industrial lines. Children are sorted into clear hierarchies, the teacher is indisputably the boss, progress is relentlessly quantified and time is divided into equal shifts, signalled by loud bells. Few of us now file through factory gates in the morning, but we still push our kids through the school gates into institutions designed for another age. </p> <p>Trends in education policy are making things worse. The national curriculum, so inflexibly enforced, is like an unreasonable edict from head office. The testing virus is out of control and emphasis is given to \"proper\" subjects such as maths and science, while art, music and drama are further downgraded. </p> <p>Perversely, many of the changes in schooling are made in the name of better equipping children for the world of work. Vocationalisation of education is the order of the day. Children and young people have got the message: the numbers studying economics and philosophy A-levels are falling as ever more plump for business studies and law. Research by Ann Sherman, from Nottingham University, found that, just one term into primary school, five-year-olds know they are there to \"get a job\" and that \"work\" is something imposed, while \"play\" is what they choose. </p> <p>This is scary stuff: primary school as the first step on the career ladder. It might just be tolerable if there were any evidence that the education system is, in fact, preparing us for work. But it is not. Employers are sceptical of exam grades and are looking for other skills. Post-industrial workers need to be self-confident team players, networkers, innovators. They need to be able to teach themselves new skills and the quirkier they are, the better. Given the needs of today's firms, who could argue that playing in a school band or football team is not going to be more valuable than sitting in a silent classroom cracking algebra questions? </p> <p>But those activities are not scored and ranked, so schools cannot focus on them. Precisely the activities that do equip young people for the new world of work are being squeezed out by a misplaced emphasis on \"core\" skills. </p> <p>New Yorker John Taylor Gatto, winner of the US Teacher of the Year award three years running, blows apart the \"three Rs\" myth in Changing Schools, a groundbreaking report from the Scottish Council Foundation. \"The truth is that reading, writing and arithmetic only take about 100 hours to transmit, as long as the audience is eager and willing to learn ...

      "bodyText": "'W e don't need no education, We don't need no thought control.' Pink Floyd's social comment is an ironic anthem for the schooled classes; the bars of Oxbridge colleges still reverberate to its beat. The message was ahead of its time. The needs of the economy have changed dramatically, but the education system is stuck in the past. While employers cry out for post-industrial workers, schools are run on strictly industrial lines. Children are sorted into clear hierarchies, the teacher is indisputably the boss, progress is relentlessly quantified and time is divided into equal shifts, signalled by loud bells. Few of us now file through factory gates in the morning, but we still push our kids through the school gates into institutions designed for another age. Trends in education policy are making things worse. The national curriculum, so inflexibly enforced, is like an unreasonable edict from head office. The testing virus is out of control and emphasis is given to \"proper\" subjects such as maths and science, while art, music and drama are further downgraded. Perversely, many of the changes in schooling are made in the name of better equipping children for the world of work. Vocationalisation of education is the order of the day. Children and young people have got the message: the numbers studying economics and philosophy A-levels are falling as ever more plump for business studies and law. Research by Ann Sherman, from Nottingham University, found that, just one term into primary school, five-year-olds know they are there to \"get a job\" and that \"work\" is something imposed, while \"play\" is what they choose. This is scary stuff: primary school as the first step on the career ladder. It might just be tolerable if there were any evidence that the education system is, in fact, preparing us for work. But it is not. Employers are sceptical of exam grades and are looking for other skills. Post-industrial workers need to be self-confident team players, networkers, innovators. They need to be able to teach themselves new skills and the quirkier they are, the better. Given the needs of today's firms, who could argue that playing in a school band or football team is not going to be more valuable than sitting in a silent classroom cracking algebra questions? But those activities are not scored and ranked, so schools cannot focus on them. Precisely the activities that do equip young people for the new world of work are being squeezed out by a misplaced emphasis on \"core\" skills. New Yorker John Taylor Gatto, winner of the US Teacher of the Year award three years running, blows apart the \"three Rs\" myth in Changing Schools, a groundbreaking report from the Scottish Council Foundation. \"The truth is that reading, writing and arithmetic only take about 100 hours to transmit, as long as the audience is eager and willing to learn ... The continuing cry for 'basic skills' is a smoke screen behind which schools pre-empt the time of children for twelve years.\" The education system's failure to adapt cannot be blamed on teachers.

Passion is for playtime. This here is a place of work.\" </p> <p>Could it actually happen? Could employers really believe that workplace liaisons are so terribly dangereuses that they would make them a sacking offence? According to recent reports, some already do. Or, to be precise, the argument has been made that certain clauses in some firms' codes of employee conduct effectively amount to a ban on romance on the shop or office floor. Those cited include an allegedly growing number of civil service departments and some major high street names. </p> <p>These, it has been claimed, are just the high-profile tip of a growing iceberg as employers in general become more nervous about the possible implications of libidinal interactions among their personnel. Coupled with the prospect of the government giving bosses the formal right to monitor employees' emails without their knowledge or consent, it seems fears about managers controlling the personal lives of subordinates more tightly than ever may be justified. </p> <p>So what exactly is going on? Marks &amp; Spencer - mentioned in a dispatch from The Director magazine as being one of those with \"stated policies that govern office romance\" - firmly denies any ban on relationships exists. But increasingly companies do appear to be feeling the need to take a tougher stance on certain connections between employees that might deflect them from their duties. </p> <p>HSBC is one of a number of banks whose employee handbook includes the requirement that personal relationships should not be allowed to impair efficiency or breach customer confidentiality. Such relationships, though, include not only lovers, but also long-term partners, siblings, parents, uncles and so on. A spokeswoman explains that, yes, HSBC employment contracts do require staff to abide by the guidance in the handbook, but insists it is absurd to suggest this amounts to a back-door ban on entanglements: \"We categorically refute the charge that it is an attempt to control people's love lives.\" </p> <p>Talk of personnel departments deploying hard-faced sex police to outlaw love- or lustlorn workers might be overdone: indeed, it is difficult to see how desire could be outlawed effectively in practice. With more and more women going out to work, and British workers toiling for more hours per week than those anywhere else in Europe, it is hardly surprising that so many of us meet our partners during our labouring hours rather than in our leisure time. </p> <p>Nonetheless, it is clear that employers are growing increasingly preoccupied by sexualised behaviour in the ranks, thanks to the substantial rise in the number of legal cases brought for sexual harassment. In the US it is now commonplace for companies to encourage or cajole employees in sexual relationships to sign \"love contracts\". Also known as consensual relationship agreements, they typically require the signatories to pledge that their arrangement has been entered into willingly and to promise that if and when it all goes horribly wrong, neither party will sue the firm's directors on grounds of sexual harassment or discrimination. </p> <p>The aim is to provide protection against the fallout from an affair. A jilted subordinate may claim she was pressured into having sex by the senior figure who has since dumped her. People may argue they were passed over because they were sleeping with someone at an adjoining desk, or claim their working life became unbearable because the company failed to act when somebody they used to be involved with wouldn't leave them alone. And so on. </p> <p>Could it catch on here? Judi James, management consultant and author of Sex At Work: A Survivor's Guide, published by the Industrial Society, thinks it unlikely. \"There's an element of scaremongering about it,\" she says. \"Some company lawyers like to stir it up, but I can't see it working in Britain.\" James doubts if people here would put up with such intrusion. \"It seems to me you're effectively asking someone not to object if they are sexually harassed by a certain person. To me, that is signing your rights away.\" </p> <p>It is unclear, she says, how US-style \"love contracts\" would hold up legally. Indeed, Bill Clinton's weasel definition of \"sexual relations\" during the Monica Lewinsky saga shows just what a quagmire of definitions may await. When exactly is a relationship deemed to be taking place? Would it have to have been pursued on the company premises or would it also incur action if only conducted elsewhere? Does penetration have to have occurred? </p> <p>Where sexual grievances are concerned, James strongly advocates that companies establish proper complaints procedures, rather than trying to insulate themselves against future litigation in individual cases. This is obviously better for employees and if an employer does find itself on the wrong end of a tribunal, it will do no harm to be able to demonstrate that it takes such matters seriously. </p> <p>As for the broader issues - the love match blossoming amid the VDUs, the jitterbugging of pheromones in the canteen - draconian suppression across the board looks unworkable, not to mention heartless and counterproductive. As work comes to dominate our waking hours, surveys have found around 40% of employees have been intimate to some degree with workmates at some time. </p> <p>Charles Cochrane, secretary of the Council of Civil Service Unions, says that the civil service - also named last week as operating a \"love ban\", though this was news to the major civil servants' professional organisations - has rules about harassment and bullying. But he would be very concerned at any attempt to snuff out mutual attraction. \"We would want to know what evidence there was that this was a problem,\" he says. \"There could be serious implications. Our Newcastle central office employs so many people that if you banned relationships there, I doubt if anyone would have a social life at all.\"</p>",

Judi James, management consultant and author of Sex At Work: A Survivor's Guide, published by the Industrial Society, thinks it unlikely. \"There's an element of scaremongering about it,\" she says. \"Some company lawyers like to stir it up, but I can't see it working in Britain.\" James doubts if people here would put up with such intrusion. \"It seems to me you're effectively asking someone not to object if they are sexually harassed by a certain person. To me, that is signing your rights away.\" It is unclear, she says, how US-style \"love contracts\" would hold up legally. Indeed, Bill Clinton's weasel definition of \"sexual relations\" during the Monica Lewinsky saga shows just what a quagmire of definitions may await. When exactly is a relationship deemed to be taking place? Would it have to have been pursued on the company premises or would it also incur action if only conducted elsewhere? Does penetration have to have occurred? Where sexual grievances are concerned, James strongly advocates that companies establish proper complaints procedures, rather than trying to insulate themselves against future litigation in individual cases. This is obviously better for employees and if an employer does find itself on the wrong end of a tribunal, it will do no harm to be able to demonstrate that it takes such matters seriously. As for the broader issues - the love match blossoming amid the VDUs, the jitterbugging of pheromones in the canteen - draconian suppression across the board looks unworkable, not to mention heartless and counterproductive. As work comes to dominate our waking hours, surveys have found around 40% of employees have been intimate to some degree with workmates at some time. Charles Cochrane, secretary of the Council of Civil Service Unions, says that the civil service - also named last week as operating a \"love ban\", though this was news to the major civil servants' professional organisations - has rules about harassment and bullying. But he would be very concerned at any attempt to snuff out mutual attraction. \"We would want to know what evidence there was that this was a problem,\" he says. \"There could be serious implications. Our Newcastle central office employs so many people that if you banned relationships there, I doubt if anyone would have a social life at all.\"",

In his speech to the Labour conference two weeks ago Mr Brown promised help for pensioners beyond the annual upgrading of the state pension in his pre-budget report, due late this month or early in November, when fuel protesters are also looking for generosity.

The married couple's pension would go up by \u00a33.60 from \u00a3107.90 to \u00a3111.50. Treasury sources said next year's above-inflation in creases would be designed to tide pensioners over until the introduction of a new pensioners' credit in 2003. There is speculation that these measures will produce an increase of \u00a35 for single pensioners and \u00a38 for couples.

Radford's idea of a joke is not to recreate the notorious skirt-raising scene, but to have Daryl Hannah's Girl undo her top and lean against a fan. Like everything else in this production, it is just a tease. </p> <p>The story is as 1950s as cherry pie. Richard, a New York publishing executive anxious about looming middle age, waves goodbye to his wife and son. Then a tomato plant from the upstairs duplex falls on his terrace, narrowly missing him. </p> <p>Instead of getting mad with the culprit, Richard falls for her - hardly surprising when she turns out to be Daryl Hannah. But Richard is consumed by guilt and keeps going into fantasy mode (cue a light change) in which he imagines his wife being unfaithful, himself being unfaithful, his wife shooting him and then herself. I fear the only genuine concern is that the audience might prove unfaithful and leave before the end, pausing only to shoot the cast. </p> <p>This isn't so much a star vehicle as a star zimmer frame. This is a pity, because although Hannah is very much a 21st-century sex goddess - twice the height of Monroe, half the width and a quarter of the charisma - she does exhibit the odd spark. Given a decent play, she might be good at comedy. </p> <p>Just as The Blue Room was about Nicole Kidman without her clothes, and The Graduate is about Jerry Hall in the buff, The Seven Year Itch is entirely about being able to gawp at Hannah's legs that reach upwards spectacularly. The gimmick is that she isn't naked. There are entire scenes where she wears a complete stitch. That's a new one for Shaftesbury Avenue, although this tired evening is further evidence that the West End has lost the will to do theatre, and now only does celebrity. </p> <p>\u0095 Until December 9.

I fear the only genuine concern is that the audience might prove unfaithful and leave before the end, pausing only to shoot the cast. This isn't so much a star vehicle as a star zimmer frame. This is a pity, because although Hannah is very much a 21st-century sex goddess - twice the height of Monroe, half the width and a quarter of the charisma - she does exhibit the odd spark. Given a decent play, she might be good at comedy. Just as The Blue Room was about Nicole Kidman without her clothes, and The Graduate is about Jerry Hall in the buff, The Seven Year Itch is entirely about being able to gawp at Hannah's legs that reach upwards spectacularly. The gimmick is that she isn't naked. There are entire scenes where she wears a complete stitch. That's a new one for Shaftesbury Avenue, although this tired evening is further evidence that the West End has lost the will to do theatre, and now only does celebrity. \u0095 Until December 9. Box office: 020-7494 5040. This review appeared in some editions of yesterday's paper.",

But they have been ordered to draw up a legally binding code of practice to ensure fair competition. Trade and Industry Secretary Stephen Byers made the demand after the Competition Commission published a report which found that the big chains operated in some ways which \"distorted\" a fair market. The long awaited report said excessive prices were not being charged and the industry was broadly competitive, essentially turning the government's \"Rip-Off Britain\" crusade into an embarrassing damp squib. But the commission's long-awaited report, which followed a year-long inquiry, highlighted three areas in which supermarkets were operating against open competition. These were the relationship between supermarkets and farmers, persistent selling of goods below cost and a limited choice of supermarkets in some areas. My Byers said: \"I agree that a code of practice should be introduced. Like the commission, I do not believe that a voluntary code would be adequate. \"The relevant supermarkets will have to give legally binding undertakings to comply with the remedies.\" Mr Byers said he was asking the Director General of Fair Trading (DGFT) to approach those supermarket chains with 8 per cent or more of the market (currently Asda, Safeway, Sainsbury, Somerfield and Tesco) to agree a code, which would meet the concerns identified by the Competition Commission. The Trade Secretary added: \"I want this matter resolved quickly and have asked the DGFT to report back to me in three months time.\" The report has been described by analysts as \"benign\" with some questioning why the investigation was launched in the first place. \"It is nearly two years of wasted time and they have come up with absolutely nothing as we knew they would,\" said Philip Dorgan of WestLB Panmure. Those thoughts were echoed by another leading food retail analyst who asked not to be named. \"It seems the Commission's report has come up short even as a face-saving exercise,\" he said. \"It didn't say an awful lot, the government has found it can't do a lot -- it is completely toothless.\"",

      "body": "<b>Why is the Omagh bombing still making headlines?</b> <br> The Omagh bomb was the worst single atrocity in Northern Ireland's history but more than two years after it killed 29 people, the culprits are still free. The BBC's Panorama programme on 9 October named four men out of 15 alleged suspects. The programme was supported by some of the families of victims who feel it could help breach the wall of silence that is protecting the guilty. But the broadcast has also been met by a chorus of concern, led by the Irish prime minister, Bertie Ahern, arguing that \"bandying names about\" has damaged the chances of securing convictions. <p><b>Do the police have any leads?</b><br> Only one of the alleged suspects, a pub landlord, has so far been accused of conspiring to cause the explosion and is awaiting trial in the Republic of Ireland. Despite one of the largest investigations ever in Northern Ireland, no one else has been charged. The authorities on both sides of the border have said that they do not have sufficient evidence to charge.</p> <p><b>What evidence did the programme cite?</b><br> Panorama gave details of the case against the suspects, which, to a large extent, hinges on mobile phones they either used or owned. Mobile phone records allegedly show their users on the journey to Omagh to plant the bomb. The BBC claimed eyewitnesses had given evidence to police as to who was using the phones but were terrified of testifying. </p> <p><b>Did it reveal anything about how the bomb was allegedly planted?</b><br> Yes. The BBC said police believe the stolen red Cavalier that carried the 500lb bomb was driven across the border behind a \"scout car\" that checked the route for police and soldiers. The drivers of the cars are thought to have spoken to each other on two mobile phones. The movements of the phones have been tracked from the Irish Republic to Omagh and then back again at a time congruous with the bombing and along a plausible route. </p> <p><b>But by naming them, has the BBC not prejudiced a future trial?</b><br> Just 90 minutes before the Panorama programme was aired, the BBC survived a legal challenge demanding that it pull the plug on the broadcast. The Northern Ireland human rights commission sought an injunction in Belfast's high court, arguing identification could damage police investigations and that there were \"implications for the personal safety and right to life\" of those named. They also said that people had a right to be protected from a \"trial by media\". But Mr Justice Kerr ruled that there was no evidence a future trial could be prejudiced whether this involved a judge sitting alone or with a jury.</p> <p><b>What do the police and families think?</b><br> The Royal Ulster Constabulary chief constable, Sir Ronnie Flanagan, sent a letter to the director general of the BBC asking for assurances that no material would be used that would or might have an \"adverse effect on future prosecutions\". Some of the families have supported the BBC, sharing their hope that the programme will jog someone's memory or conscience. However, others have been critical, including Lawrence Rush, who lost his wife in the bombing. Mr Rush started the legal moves against the programme in the Belfast high court on Friday last week. </p> <p><b>Who are the suspects the BBC have named?</b><br> The Guardian, the Daily Telegraph and the Independent have not named them, but the Times and the Daily Mail have followed the BBC in doing so. The men named by the BBC all live in the Republic, in the border area around South Armagh and Co Meath. One has a previous conviction for terrorist offences. </p> <p><b>Will the murderers ever be brought to justice?</b><br> The police investigation continues. Last week Mr Ahern announced tougher measures against the Real IRA. He met the prime minister, Tony Blair, in Downing Street today to attempt to move on the stalled peace process and it is likely that their discussions included the Omagh bombing. But much will depend on whether new evidence is found, if new witnesses come forward, or if the ones already known to the police can be convinced to testify against the alleged terrorists.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br></p> <p><a href=\" http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Northern_Ireland/Story/0,2763,380133,00.html\">Related story: Panorama returns to form</a><br></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Northern_Ireland/0,2759,178755,00.html\"> Special report: Northern Ireland</a><br></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/BBC/0,2759,177763,00.html\"> Special report: the future of the BBC </a><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Why is the Omagh bombing still making headlines? The Omagh bomb was the worst single atrocity in Northern Ireland's history but more than two years after it killed 29 people, the culprits are still free. The BBC's Panorama programme on 9 October named four men out of 15 alleged suspects. The programme was supported by some of the families of victims who feel it could help breach the wall of silence that is protecting the guilty. But the broadcast has also been met by a chorus of concern, led by the Irish prime minister, Bertie Ahern, arguing that \"bandying names about\" has damaged the chances of securing convictions. Do the police have any leads? Only one of the alleged suspects, a pub landlord, has so far been accused of conspiring to cause the explosion and is awaiting trial in the Republic of Ireland. Despite one of the largest investigations ever in Northern Ireland, no one else has been charged. The authorities on both sides of the border have said that they do not have sufficient evidence to charge. What evidence did the programme cite? Panorama gave details of the case against the suspects, which, to a large extent, hinges on mobile phones they either used or owned. Mobile phone records allegedly show their users on the journey to Omagh to plant the bomb. The BBC claimed eyewitnesses had given evidence to police as to who was using the phones but were terrified of testifying. Did it reveal anything about how the bomb was allegedly planted? Yes. The BBC said police believe the stolen red Cavalier that carried the 500lb bomb was driven across the border behind a \"scout car\" that checked the route for police and soldiers. The drivers of the cars are thought to have spoken to each other on two mobile phones. The movements of the phones have been tracked from the Irish Republic to Omagh and then back again at a time congruous with the bombing and along a plausible route. But by naming them, has the BBC not prejudiced a future trial? Just 90 minutes before the Panorama programme was aired, the BBC survived a legal challenge demanding that it pull the plug on the broadcast. The Northern Ireland human rights commission sought an injunction in Belfast's high court, arguing identification could damage police investigations and that there were \"implications for the personal safety and right to life\" of those named. They also said that people had a right to be protected from a \"trial by media\". But Mr Justice Kerr ruled that there was no evidence a future trial could be prejudiced whether this involved a judge sitting alone or with a jury. What do the police and families think? The Royal Ulster Constabulary chief constable, Sir Ronnie Flanagan, sent a letter to the director general of the BBC asking for assurances that no material would be used that would or might have an \"adverse effect on future prosecutions\". Some of the families have supported the BBC, sharing their hope that the programme will jog someone's memory or conscience. However, others have been critical, including Lawrence Rush, who lost his wife in the bombing. Mr Rush started the legal moves against the programme in the Belfast high court on Friday last week. Who are the suspects the BBC have named? The Guardian, the Daily Telegraph and the Independent have not named them, but the Times and the Daily Mail have followed the BBC in doing so. The men named by the BBC all live in the Republic, in the border area around South Armagh and Co Meath. One has a previous conviction for terrorist offences. Will the murderers ever be brought to justice? The police investigation continues. Last week Mr Ahern announced tougher measures against the Real IRA. He met the prime minister, Tony Blair, in Downing Street today to attempt to move on the stalled peace process and it is likely that their discussions included the Omagh bombing. But much will depend on whether new evidence is found, if new witnesses come forward, or if the ones already known to the police can be convinced to testify against the alleged terrorists.

Trade and Industry Secretary Stephen Byers made the demand after the Competition Commission published a report which found that the big chains operated in some ways which \"distorted\" a fair market. The competition watchdog's report cleared the retailers of charging overall excessive prices and making excessive profits. But the commission's long-awaited report, which followed a year-long inquiry, highlighted three areas in which supermarkets were operating against open competition. These were the relationship between supermarkets and farmers, persistent selling of goods below cost and a limited choice of supermarkets in some areas. My Byers said: \"I agree that a code of practice should be introduced. Like the commission, I do not believe that a voluntary code would be adequate. \"The relevant supermarkets will have to give legally binding undertakings to comply with the remedies.\" Mr Byers said he was asking the Director General of Fair Trading (DGFT) to approach those supermarket chains with 8 per cent or more of the market (currently Asda, Safeway, Sainsbury, Somerfield and Tesco) to agree a code, which would meet the concerns identified by the Competition Commission.

He said: \"The majority of jobs in senior management positions (Grade 18) were not advertised but communicated by word of mouth to a selected circle of known individuals. \"A dining room existed for the sole use of Grade 18 employees and above. This [meant] discussions about vacancies and other related matters took place within the confines of a private dining room.\" Mr Lalbeharry, 57, from Haringey, north London, gave five examples of white colleagues being given opportunities to gain experience which allowed them to become more qualified for promotion. The staff who rose to senior management were less qualified and experienced than he was, he told the hearing. In September 1995 he expressed his unhappiness about being bypassed for promotion to his financial director, but was told to drop the matter. He said: \"The financial director at the time said he was appalled by the way I had been treated. \"I was assured that the chairman was unhappy but it was suggested that the incident should be allowed to close.\" Paul Goulding QC, for Lloyd's Register of Shipping, drew attention to Mr Lalbeharry's work appraisal reports, which showed his performance declined before he complained of being bypassed for promotion. The hearing continues today. Press Association",

      "body": "<p>Karen Ward was convinced she was going mad. \"I was in floods of tears,\" she says. \"I had terrible mood swings, had become very clumsy and my memory seemed to be going.\" Her mother eventually persuaded her to go to the doctor. \"I told him I needed someone to help me,\" recalls Karen, now 45. \"He just stared at me. Then he told me he'd had a bad day, too.\" After a year of suffering, Karen, a social worker from Shropshire, realised that she was fine for two weeks every month, but a different person for the other two. \"I finally clicked that it must be premenstrual syndrome. But the doctor's reaction made me feel I was making a fuss about nothing.\" </p> <p>Most women suffer to some degree from premenstrual tension. Far more severe, however, is premenstrual syndrome (PMS), which affects around 5% of women. It can incapacitate them for days. The concept of PMS has long been difficult for the medical profession to deal with. The lack of sympathy that Karen received is common, although Dr Mayur Lakhani, vice-chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners, has grounds for optimism. </p> <p>\"It's difficult, because there's no diagnostic test,\" he says. \"A lot of our efforts have been directed at things like recommending the pill, which evidence now suggests doesn't help. We need to rethink.\" This rethink is reflected by a recent report in the Lancet that PMS sufferers can be helped, both emotionally and physically, by Prozac. But now some women are worried they will be given the antidepressant just to get them out of the doctor's surgery. </p> <p>Dr Paul Dimmock, one of those responsible for the report, says that won't happen. He and colleagues from Keele University and North Staffordshire Hospital reviewed a number of studies of a group of drugs called selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and their effectiveness in treating PMS. Prozac is one of these drugs. \"There's no doubt that these SSRIs helped women with PMS,\" he says. \"That's because, for a few days a month, the hormonal cycle causes an imbalance of serotonin in the brain. Taking SSRIs addresses that imbalance. It is not acting as an antidepressant.\" </p> <p>Karen Ward agrees. \"I'd tried everything,\" she says. \"I honestly thought there was nothing that could control it. Then I tried Prozac and it worked almost instantly. It gave me a quality of life I hadn't had for years.\" </p> <p>Dr Dimmock says the SSRIs work on physical as well as mental symptoms because the brain chemicals control general well-being. But what's particularly interesting about his work is how it appears to question whether traditional ways of dealing with the syndrome are correct. \"The licensed drugs for PMS, such as progesterone or oestrogen, are not very effective,\" says Dr Dimmock. </p> <p>The reason for this, says Dr Maurice Katz, who runs a specialist PMS clinic at London's Elizabeth Garret Anderson Hospital, is that most women with PMS have normal hormones. This means there's no reason for hormone treatment. \"In the past, it was often found that giving a patient progesterone made them feel better,\" says Dr Katz. \"But that's because progesterone acts as a sedative. Oestrogen was also given, but it's rare for women to have an oestrogen deficiency.\" </p> <p>Karen Ward was given progesterone pessaries and oestrogen patches. Neither helped. This would have been no surprise to Katz. He has no doubt that Prozac can help PMS sufferers, but says this is most common when their dominant symptoms are depression or aggression. \"It must be targeted at specific patients,\" he says. \"If a patient's main symptom is bloating or migraines, Prozac is not the answer. Diet is important, as are lifestyle and stress. Counselling is often overlooked, too. Many patients have problems with psychological causes.\" </p> <p>In the past, this suggestion of psychological causes has caused some to conclude that the illness does not exist. That is not what Katz and colleagues are suggesting, but hints that PMS may have psychological foundations have been used by some, including doctors, to accuse women of malingering. </p> <p>Jemma Taylor noticed her symptoms four years ago. It was soon after a divorce and she initially thought that her constant anger and irritability reflected those difficult times. Then she realised they weren't going away, and that she only felt this way at certain times of the month. \"The doctor just palmed me off,\" she says. \"He told me I'd have to live with it. I had to fight to be treated.\" Jemma went to another doctor who suggested she try the pill (for its hormonal effects). It made no difference, so she was prescribed Prozac. But her experience was quite different from Karen's. \"It was awful. I needed to be calmed down, not lifted up. I couldn't focus. I couldn't sleep. I was sweating. It was like drinking lots of cups of coffee.\" </p> <p>Eventually Jemma found a specialist PMS clinic in Leeds and now has her illness under control. \"I changed my diet,\" she says. \"It was things I hadn't thought of, like eating little and often and trying to stay calm. Prozac definitely didn't help and I don't like the idea of it being given out to anyone with a problem.\" </p> <p>This should not happen. Prozac is licensed only for severe cases and the doses given are small. However, the Medicines Control Agency recently warned that Prozac can make people feel suicidal and there is concern about putting another swathe of people on to the drug. \"We would certainly applaud the use of Prozac for those who benefit,\" says Christine Baker from the National Association for Premenstrual Syndrome. \"But we would like to stress that diet and a healthy lifestyle should be looked at first. We have had calls from women who don't want to take it but whose doctors are trying to persuade them to, and we have had calls from women who say it's changed their lives. </p> <p>\"There don't seem to be any adverse effects in the long term. But if the symptoms return when someone comes off it, they might have to take it for years. There's no one treatment for PMS. We're keen for women to know there are different approaches.\" </p> <p>\"We're not suggesting just throwing pills at women,\" says Dr Dimmock. \"We've looked at other things, like vitamin B6, and there's evidence that works too, but not as forcefully. PMS has to be taken more seriously. We still don't know its cause, but we're moving on when it comes to treatment.\"</p>",

What she discovered, after the birth of her daughter Layna, was that the worst thing of all was having a baby with an undiagnosed medical problem. </p> <p>Layna was born on the same day as Leo Blair, May 20: while the nation had its eyes on the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in central London, across the water at the Royal Maternity Hospital in Belfast, Layna's appearance was hastened by forceps. </p> <p>\"They thought that's why she was puffy,\" says Morelli, 25, a drama student at Queen's University. \"But the swelling didn't go down, and I could see the midwives getting more and more worried. She was in her cot by my bed and paediatrician after paediatrician kept coming along to have a look at her. I was worried sick, but they weren't saying anything to me. Eventually I plucked up the courage to ask one what was wrong. He said, 'I don't want to worry you, but have you heard of Turner's syndrome?'\" </p> <p>Morelli hadn't, but over the next few days, as she waited for the test results, she learned a lot. \"Friends tried to be helpful and brought me information from the internet. They were trying to be kind but it was terrifying - Turner's meant my baby's heart would be deformed, she'd be on drugs, and she'd be infertile. I was still reeling from the shock when the geneticist came to say the tests were negative.\" </p> <p>Morelli was so relieved that it only hit her later that her daughter still had a problem, and doctors didn't have a clue what it was. </p> <p>Layna was discharged from hospital, but had to return for regular check-ups - and as days turned to weeks, the fluid retention got worse and Morelli's fears grew. \"I remember looking into her pram one day when we were out, and seeing this little ghostly face peering out at me,\" she says. \"Her nappies were foul-smelling too - it was clear something was very wrong.\" Eventually, when she was a few weeks old, Layna was readmitted. </p> <p>\"She was going downhill fast - the swelling in her hands and feet was deteriorating, and although she was hungry all the time she wasn't getting any bigger. In fact she was wasting away - you could see her veins through her distended belly. I'd sit by her all day long and it would gnaw away at me what could be wrong, and what could be done. I've have done anything to make her better. Doctors kept coming in to look at her, and I'd look at them and plead silently for them to say, 'We know what it is, we've got the answer.' But they were as perplexed as I was.\" </p> <p>Doctors did blood test after blood test, x-ray after x-ray, took sample after sample. The breakthrough came when, still not knowing what was wrong, Layna was given albumin intravenously. Whatever her condition was, she wasn't getting enough protein - with the albumin, there was at least a slight improvement. A biopsy of Layna's bowel showed that she was suffering from some kind of malabsorption problem - and though she was too ill to undergo a planned second biopsy, she was put onto a special milk containing pre-digested fats. \"It wasn't a fast turnaround, but she started picking up slowly,\" says Morelli. </p> <p>Finally, after 10 long weeks of waiting and worrying, the consultant gave her child's condition a name: intestinal lymphangiectasia. \"I hadn't heard of it before, of course, but what it meant was that the lymph vessels supplying the lining of Layna's small intestine are enlarged, which led to the fluid retention and stopped her absorbing fats from her milk.\" </p> <p>Getting a label for Layna's condition was a huge step forward, finding out what it meant proved more difficult. The condition is so rare that it affects only a handful of children in the UK and most of the doctors who have been treating Layna have never encountered it. </p> <p>What Morelli, who is a single parent, wanted to do most was talk to another mother who had been there and understood. Fortunately the charity Contact A Family has been able to put her in touch with Karen Lightowler, who lives near Keighley in Yorkshire. Her daughter Emma, now 11, was diagnosed with this illness at two. </p> <p>\"We had two years of worry, two years of illness, two years of tests. And at the end of it, we were told she had something the doctors knew hardly anything about. I was convinced she had cystic fibrosis, and she was tested for it several times. Of course it's never good to hear your child has cystic fibrosis, but at least they know a lot about it, at least you can talk to other parents who've been in the same situation. I just felt so alone, so much as though they were stabbing in the dark with the treatments they came up with.\" </p> <p>Intestinal lymphangiectasia is so rare that the Lightowlers abandoned their attempt to set up a support group, but they do provide support by telephone to other parents whose child has been diagnosed with the condition, and are in touch with six families in the UK and a couple in the US. \"What you really want is to know other families where the child is older than yours, so you know what to expect in the future,\" says Karen. \"Also, it's good just to know that there are people who've made it into their 20s. We also heard of a case where a woman had children of her own, which was reassuring, as we've been told pregnancy might be difficult for Emma.\" </p> <p>The good news is that, with special diets, both Layna and Emma are thriving. Layna, now four months, is back home and, says Morelli, \"looks fantastic\". \"You'd never guess what she'd been through,\" she says. Emma is small for her age and has to have nightly tube feeds directly into her stomach, but in every other respect she leads a normal teenage life. \"Of course there are times when things are difficult, when you worry and wonder about the future,\" says Karen. \"But at least there are other parents I can talk to now, and I know they'll understand.\" </p> <p>The Guardian is following the fortunes of 10 babies born on the same day as Leo Blair.

It probably sounds like some urban myth, like something that never really happens to real people in real life, but the awful fact is that it does happen in real life. Not that often, but often enough. </p> <p>Laura Cook, a 12-year-old girl from Kent, is the latest person to come forward with such a story. She was fully conscious for up to 40 minutes, although paralysed by muscle-relaxing drugs, during an operation to remove her appendix. She could hear the surgeon asking for the implements she knew he was going to cut her with. </p> <p>As chance would have it, something very similar happened to my mother when I was born by caesarian section. She came round to feel something that felt very much like her innards being ripped out. She tried to scream, but couldn't raise her voice above a muffled whimper. Eventually, she thinks, the anaesthetist noticed the tiny movements she managed to make with her eyes and sent her back under. </p> <p>My mother did not report her experience, but Laura's parents did - and are now planning to sue. </p> <p>As with many of these disturbing cases, it appears that the anaesthetist concerned, Dr Joseph Balzan, failed to ensure a continuous supply of anaesthetic gas during the operation (the other reason commonly given for these incidents is that the supply of anaesthetic ran out without anyone noticing). So the paralysing agent that Laura was given, intravenously, worked, but she didn't get enough of the anaesthetic gas through the tube down her windpipe. </p> <p>Laura's parents are disgusted that Dr Balzan is still working at the Princess Alexandra Hospital, where it is not normal policy to suspend a doctor in cases of human error. The General Medical Council has said it will be at least six months before any potential misconduct charges could be brought. </p> <p>Professor Peter Hutton, president of the Royal College of Anaesthetists, is keen to point out that it is \"extremely uncommon\" to be \"aware\" during an operation, although he does say that he cannot give an exact number because \"the majority of cases are settled without anyone knowing anything about it\". </p> <p>Hutton estimates that the incidence is around 10 per million operations. This is a small figure, but it still means that if every person in Britain were to have an operation at some stage in their life, it would be, for 600 of us, a truly agonising ordeal. </p> <p>Hutton says the biggest risk is in having a caesarian, as my mother did, because the dose of anaesthetic must be kept as low as possible. </p> <p>\"The difficulty is that you're trying to anaesthetise the mother but not the baby, but they're joined by a common blood supply,\" he says. </p> <p>He also points out that administering an anaesthetic is a precise art. After an initial injection to put the patient to sleep, anaesthetic levels are carefully monitored during the operation to suit the individual patient. This is done by monitoring four key indicators: blood pressure, pulse, sweating and tearing (eye watering). </p> <p>If a patient is not getting enough anaesthetic, their pulse and blood pressure will start to rise, and, ideally, someone should spot that and increase the amount of anaesthetic. If these signs are missed, the doctors may not realise something's wrong until the paralysing agent starts to wear off after half an hour or so. </p> <p>Stephanie Ellis, of Patient Concern, says: \"We get up to a dozen complaints a year, although it is less likely to occur now than ever before. The problem is that there is no such thing as an entirely safe anaesthetic. It is a balancing act.\" </p> <p>Another problem, from the patient's point of view, is that the ordeal may be dismissed as fantasy. \"Some anaesthetists believe these experiences are just vivid dreams stimulated by voices the patients can hear around the table,\" says Ellis. \"When patients get to us it is usually because they are angry about how the complaint was dealt with by the health authority rather than the actual effects of the drug and operation.\" </p> <p>For those who do go through such an ordeal, the impact may be severe. Laura has been diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder since her operation. \"Quite often people who have gone through this experience require counselling afterwards as they develop a phobia about going to sleep,\" says Hutton.</p>",

Is there any real evidence that lifestyle matters, or is it all down to genes and luck?</strong> </p> <p> <strong>A </strong>The best evidence that lifestyle matters relates to women but surely applies to men too. In 1976, 122,000 female American nurses aged 30-55 were selected and followed up using biannual questionnaires. In the past 14 years, there have been 1,128 heart attacks and 705 strokes. Women with the healthiest lifestyles had 80% less chance of having a heart attack or stroke. It's easy to get defeatist about health and reckon that if you smoke, there's little point in exercising because you're going to die anyway and so on. But it's not true; every little helps on the path to the perfect lifestyle, so listen to your kids, wise up and go for one goal at a time - preferably by ditching cigarettes first, as that's the single biggest danger to you.

Hormones from your brain are making the male hormone in your bloodstream rise. Unfortunately, this also causes a temporary increase in \"female\" hormones called oestrogens, and that's why your breasts have grown. Your breasts will start shrinking soon as your \"male\" hormone, testosterone, kicks in. By the time you're 17, you are unlikely to have enlarged breasts. You may also find it reassuring to know that temporary breast enlargement seems to be linked to more advanced development of the penis and testicles. Any boy who laughs at you and doesn't have enlarged breasts almost certainly has a smaller penis and testicles than you. </p> <p>\u0095 These answers are as accurate and full as possible, but should never be used as a substitute for seeking medical help.

Mr Cook is expected to set off tomorrow on a tour of Israel, the occupied territories, Jordan and Syria, said a Foreign Office source. Earlier today, Israel's prime minister Ehud Barak pulled back from the brink of war to give Palestinian leaders more time to quell the clashes that have killed 88 people over the last 12 days. But new violence flared in the Gaza Strip, where hospital officials said a 12-year-old Palestinian boy had been critically wounded by a bullet to the head. The Israeli leader's change in position, including an expression of willingness to attend a US-hosted peace summit if one is arranged, came after two phone calls from the US president, Bill Clinton, Israel's army radio reported. Mr Barak, who is under international pressure to avert war, said he had made the decision after weighing the possibility of a prolonged, armed conflict. A Palestinian uprising against Israel in 1987 lasted six years and ended with the first, historic peace accord in 1993 with the PLO. Mr Barak told the Israeli army radio: \"It is right to bear up for a few more days... and not find ourselves in a few more weeks or months bogged down in a difficult conflict knowing that we may have been able to prevent it.\" Meanwhile, the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, the European Union security chief Javier Solana, and the Russian foreign minister Igor Ivanov pressed ahead with efforts to restore calm. Mr Ivanov met Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in the Gaza strip. \"We discussed in detail everything to save the peace process, and how to protect it in spite of all the challenges we are facing,\" Mr Arafat said afterwards. But he renewed accusations that Israel has used excessive force against rioters. The sides were discussing, through third parties, a Palestinian demand that Israel agree to allow an international commission to investigate the events. Most of the dead have been Palestinians. Nabil Shaath, a senior aide to Mr Arafat, said a UN envoy was delivering a letter to the Israelis listing countries the Palestinians would accept on such a commission. Mr Barak today appeared readier to compromise on the issue, telling Israel radio he would accept an inquiry \"under the authority and responsibility of the United States\". Previously, he had said he would only consider submitting Israeli findings to the Americans for review. However, Raanan Cohen, a minister in Mr Barak's government, said the extension to the conflict deadline was only a matter of \"one, two or three days\".

      "body": "<p>Urgent steps must be taken to make music lessons popular by injecting more pop and dance, a new report on arts education says today.</p> <p>The teaching of music at secondary level is \"increasingly specialist, exclusive, technical and dull\" and needs \"a major overhaul\", says the study by the national foundation for educational research. It also calls for drama and dance education to be upgraded to give it the same status in the national curriculum as music and art.</p> <p>There was \"a remarkable range of positive effects\" in expressive arts and in some schools it was taught \"superbly well\". But even the best schools had weaknesses and \"the picture is less than satisfactory for the majority of schools and pupils\".</p> <p>The report warns the government's support for specialist schools may encourage the belief among pupils that \"the arts are only for the talented\".</p> <p>The government will today promise an extra \u00a310m a year for school instruments and more help for music teaching, bringing funding in England to \u00a360m next year.</p> <p>The foundation report, Arts Education in Secondary Schools: Effects and Effectiveness, was commissioned by the Royal Society of Arts. It is based on three years of research and based on detailed studies of five schools and evidence from more than 150.</p> <p>In the study, 63% of school leavers indicated they had learnt very little from music at secondary school. It was unpopular at GCSE level and \"pupil enjoyment, relevance, skill deployment and expressive dimensions were often absent\".</p> <p>The report says: \"There is an urgent need to tackle the quality of teaching in this subject.\" It urges new training for music teachers conducted by others from the best schools.</p> <p>The study notes how music is the most popular art form outside of school, and is popular at primary school, but does not connect at secondary level. \"It's a lot to do with music teachers being prepared to use musical forms and genres relevant to young people out of school.\" Successful teachers were able to breakdown the boundaries between hip-hop, jazz and classical music. \"Children's own preferred music and dance forms need to be used as an entry into a wider range of music.\"</p> <p>Dr Hudson said it was noticeable that music - unlike the other arts - became less about skill development and more about study. \"Music will wither on the vine unless teachers find a way of engaging pupils.\"</p> <p>Roger Durston, principal of the Brit School for Performing Arts in Croydon, south London, agreed. \"When music changed from being a subject which was just songbooks and a piano and a teacher it required a massive reinvestment to make it exciting\" - including high-tech equipment and instruments.</p> <p>\"That's really how young people's music is made today. There's a disparity between music in schools and the music that young people like in their lives,\" said Mr Durston. Teachers trained in classical music needed to be brought up to date with modern production methods.</p> <p>The report says that even in schools with good reputations for teaching, pupils believed they had received limited development of their critical faculties.</p> <p>Art and music are established \"foundation\" subjects in the secondary curriculum from 11-14.

      "bodyText": "Urgent steps must be taken to make music lessons popular by injecting more pop and dance, a new report on arts education says today. The teaching of music at secondary level is \"increasingly specialist, exclusive, technical and dull\" and needs \"a major overhaul\", says the study by the national foundation for educational research. It also calls for drama and dance education to be upgraded to give it the same status in the national curriculum as music and art. There was \"a remarkable range of positive effects\" in expressive arts and in some schools it was taught \"superbly well\". But even the best schools had weaknesses and \"the picture is less than satisfactory for the majority of schools and pupils\". The report warns the government's support for specialist schools may encourage the belief among pupils that \"the arts are only for the talented\". The government will today promise an extra \u00a310m a year for school instruments and more help for music teaching, bringing funding in England to \u00a360m next year. The foundation report, Arts Education in Secondary Schools: Effects and Effectiveness, was commissioned by the Royal Society of Arts. It is based on three years of research and based on detailed studies of five schools and evidence from more than 150. In the study, 63% of school leavers indicated they had learnt very little from music at secondary school. It was unpopular at GCSE level and \"pupil enjoyment, relevance, skill deployment and expressive dimensions were often absent\". The report says: \"There is an urgent need to tackle the quality of teaching in this subject.\" It urges new training for music teachers conducted by others from the best schools. The study notes how music is the most popular art form outside of school, and is popular at primary school, but does not connect at secondary level. \"It's a lot to do with music teachers being prepared to use musical forms and genres relevant to young people out of school.\" Successful teachers were able to breakdown the boundaries between hip-hop, jazz and classical music. \"Children's own preferred music and dance forms need to be used as an entry into a wider range of music.\" Dr Hudson said it was noticeable that music - unlike the other arts - became less about skill development and more about study. \"Music will wither on the vine unless teachers find a way of engaging pupils.\" Roger Durston, principal of the Brit School for Performing Arts in Croydon, south London, agreed. \"When music changed from being a subject which was just songbooks and a piano and a teacher it required a massive reinvestment to make it exciting\" - including high-tech equipment and instruments. \"That's really how young people's music is made today. There's a disparity between music in schools and the music that young people like in their lives,\" said Mr Durston. Teachers trained in classical music needed to be brought up to date with modern production methods. The report says that even in schools with good reputations for teaching, pupils believed they had received limited development of their critical faculties. Art and music are established \"foundation\" subjects in the secondary curriculum from 11-14. But drama and dance are allocated space only within English and PE. The report said art was the \"strongest and most robust\" of the subjects investigated. Dance and drama delivered impressive results but lacked status in the curriculum. But the report rejects making an arts subject compulsory at GCSE level, because that makes it unpopular. Peter Cheeseman, chairman of the National Council for Drama Training, said the report was \"enormously positive and well-researched\". Main findings \u0095Arts are important in education in themselves, because of what they do and how they do it, more than for what they might or might not contribute to other areas of learning, or to life in general \u0095Some schools can achieve high-quality provision in the four main art forms ... the picture is less than satisfactory for the majority of schools and pupils \u0095Pupils perceive music in the secondary curriculum as increasingly specialist, exclusive, technical and dull. That reality sits uneasily with the rhetoric about music in education, as well as with the enthusiasm amongst primary school children, and young people outside school",

Four of the top six were caught in the same position, deep square leg. It\u0092s pretty much what you expect from Andy Flintoff. It\u0092s not what you expect from Alec Stewart, Graham Thorpe, or Graeme Hick on one of his good days. On a flat pitch, with short boundaries, they were not wrong to take the aerial route, but they were to blame for not making sure they cleared the rope.

White has played in two one-day series in South Africa without noticing that you don\u0092t take quick singles to Jonty Rhodes\u0092s right. Caddick refused to be photographed with an elephant earlier in the week, saying, in his first recorded attempt at self-mockery, that he was \u0091already one of the herd\u0092.

And so it proved. At 154 for 4 in the 36th over, with Hick and Flintoff well set on a surface that suited their heavy-hitting style, England had their sights on a total of 250. Instead they added just 28, throwing away not just wickets but overs as well. Paul Grayson, who regards himself as more of a batsman than a bowler, was pushed down the order behind Mark Ealham (an arguable decision) and White (an unfathomable one).

About once a year, the South Africans do collapse in one-day cricket, but this was not to be the day. Darren Gough bowled too many no-balls, Caddick blew hot and lukewarm, and England\u0092s only other potential matchwinner, Alan Mullally, was back home in Hampshire. Hick added two catches to his runs, one of them a classic. But it was too little, too late. All South Africa had to do was what England hadn\u0092t managed \u0096 to bat sensibly. They played straight, they punished the wayward delivery, and not once did they loft the ball in the direction of deep square leg. </p> <p><em>Tim de Lisle is editor of wisden.com. <a href=\" http://www.cricketunlimited.co.uk/Articles/0,5217,379658,00.html\">Click here</a> for his previous piece, on Australia's shock exit from the tournament.</em></p>",

THIS CIRCULATED TO ALL BBC STAFF AND REGIONS: Request from London Newsdesk: \"Could any outlets speaking to government ministers in the course of the day ask if they have ever used cannabis.\"</p> <p><strong>Monkey's uncle at Lastminute</strong><br>It's official. Monkey mania is sweeping the internet world. Monkey's family has never been so busy - at the moment we're the de rigeur accessory for any website and we've got work coming out of our ears. While Monkey is quite happy tarting it around medialand, my family keep cropping up in all guises. Uncle Harry, last seen at webmonkey.com, appears to have been doing a spot of moonlighting and has been spotted doing \"essential maintenance work\" on version 2 of Lastminute.com's website - <a href=\"http://v2.lastminute.com\">v2.lastminute.com</a>. Note the family resemblance with the rolling eyes? If you're very lucky, Uncle Harry lets you through to look at the development version.</p> <p><strong>Below-the-belt campaign</strong><br>PR Week reports on a fascinating new development at the People's Bank, which has launched a new affinity card with the Vegetarian Society. Journalists were reportedly lured to the press conference using that age-old trick, the promise of a freebie. So what did the People's Bank use to tempt busy journalists away from their desks? A branded apron, which, according to PR Week, \"they were encouraged to wear at home while cooking\". How could anyone resist?</p> <p><strong>Readers' wives online</strong><br>While checking to see which of its flagship magazines Northern &amp; Shell has registered the domain names of, Monkey was amused to find that a certain webmeister, the one and only Richard Evans, is the proud registrar of readerswives.com. Intrigued, Monkey checked out the website only to find it defaults to Object1, the digital agency where Richard works. For a brief second, Monkey thought Richard may have devoted an entire site to his missus, the delectable Tarnya Norse from Mediasurface. Phew, what a relief.</p> <p> <strong>What a bummer</strong><br>Does somebody at the BBC have it in for arsetastic Granada TV sitcom The Royle Family? We only ask because, following on from the BBC's Montreux Royle Family triumph - when the show's chances of bagging a Golden Rose were scuppered because some dozy BBC minion sent a tape of the wrong episode for the judges to watch - the comedy has been hit by another tape-sending cock-up. Queue much bemused scratching of heads in newspaper preview offices across medialand, as the BBC's awesomely efficient publicity machine sent out tapes of the fifth episode of the new run of The Royle Family, masquerading as the series opener. As Jim Royle would say, \"BBC publicity - my arse\". </p> <p><strong>Dot.conservatives</strong><br>The Monkey heartily applauds the Conservative Party's latest brave stand against the shocking political bias of that commie-pinko-shirtlifting collective that masquerades as the nation's public service broadcaster. Obviously wanting to do our bit to help expose the hordes of subversive degenerates hiding under beds at the BBC, we feel duty bound to draw Central Office's attention to seethru.co.uk, the so-like-a-real-website-its-incredible website for BBC2 dot.com drama Attachments. Said site contains a thinly veiled attack on the shadow home secretary's brave stand against that hardcore criminal element, cannabis smokers, under the headline \"Widdecombe you hilarious clown\". This is an outrageous misrepresentation of the facts and a clear example of political bias - La Widdecombe has never been funny in her life. </p> <p><br><strong>Barely believable</strong><br> Kevin Brown, founding partner of Soul and a successful and no doubt wealthy ad man, is simply unable to resist starring in his own ads. However, friends of his have this week admitted he's now taken things too far by stripping down to the short and curlies - something he appears to have plenty of - for the sake of the Daily Star's \"MegaStar\" campaign. The poster features a nude - and rather flushed - Mr Brown covering (just) his modesty with a board advertising the site. Mark Cranmer, chief executive at Starcom Motive and a dear friend of his, said: \"Kevin has a long history of exhibiting himself. He's done ads promoting gambling, alcohol and now blatant sex. I feel he should have asked for his legs to be retouched, though, because he seems to be suffering from the skinny legs/fat gut syndrome that comes to all men as they get older. I love Kevin, but he is mad.\" Even one of Kevin's co-founders is advising people to turn a blind eye to the stunt. \"I wouldn't look at it if I were you - you might find it offensive,\" he said. You're not wrong, Duncan.</p> <p><strong>Caught out on a techie point</strong><br> Programmers panning TV shows? Geeks up in arms about TV stars? What the heck is going on? Anyone would think the BBC had made a show about a dot.com start-up.

THIS CIRCULATED TO ALL BBC STAFF AND REGIONS: Request from London Newsdesk: \"Could any outlets speaking to government ministers in the course of the day ask if they have ever used cannabis.\" Monkey's uncle at Lastminute It's official. Monkey mania is sweeping the internet world. Monkey's family has never been so busy - at the moment we're the de rigeur accessory for any website and we've got work coming out of our ears. While Monkey is quite happy tarting it around medialand, my family keep cropping up in all guises. Uncle Harry, last seen at webmonkey.com, appears to have been doing a spot of moonlighting and has been spotted doing \"essential maintenance work\" on version 2 of Lastminute.com's website - v2.lastminute.com. Note the family resemblance with the rolling eyes? If you're very lucky, Uncle Harry lets you through to look at the development version. Below-the-belt campaign PR Week reports on a fascinating new development at the People's Bank, which has launched a new affinity card with the Vegetarian Society. Journalists were reportedly lured to the press conference using that age-old trick, the promise of a freebie. So what did the People's Bank use to tempt busy journalists away from their desks? A branded apron, which, according to PR Week, \"they were encouraged to wear at home while cooking\". How could anyone resist? Readers' wives online While checking to see which of its flagship magazines Northern &amp; Shell has registered the domain names of, Monkey was amused to find that a certain webmeister, the one and only Richard Evans, is the proud registrar of readerswives.com. Intrigued, Monkey checked out the website only to find it defaults to Object1, the digital agency where Richard works. For a brief second, Monkey thought Richard may have devoted an entire site to his missus, the delectable Tarnya Norse from Mediasurface. Phew, what a relief. What a bummer Does somebody at the BBC have it in for arsetastic Granada TV sitcom The Royle Family? We only ask because, following on from the BBC's Montreux Royle Family triumph - when the show's chances of bagging a Golden Rose were scuppered because some dozy BBC minion sent a tape of the wrong episode for the judges to watch - the comedy has been hit by another tape-sending cock-up. Queue much bemused scratching of heads in newspaper preview offices across medialand, as the BBC's awesomely efficient publicity machine sent out tapes of the fifth episode of the new run of The Royle Family, masquerading as the series opener. As Jim Royle would say, \"BBC publicity - my arse\". Dot.conservatives The Monkey heartily applauds the Conservative Party's latest brave stand against the shocking political bias of that commie-pinko-shirtlifting collective that masquerades as the nation's public service broadcaster. Obviously wanting to do our bit to help expose the hordes of subversive degenerates hiding under beds at the BBC, we feel duty bound to draw Central Office's attention to seethru.co.uk, the so-like-a-real-website-its-incredible website for BBC2 dot.com drama Attachments. Said site contains a thinly veiled attack on the shadow home secretary's brave stand against that hardcore criminal element, cannabis smokers, under the headline \"Widdecombe you hilarious clown\". This is an outrageous misrepresentation of the facts and a clear example of political bias - La Widdecombe has never been funny in her life. Barely believable Kevin Brown, founding partner of Soul and a successful and no doubt wealthy ad man, is simply unable to resist starring in his own ads. However, friends of his have this week admitted he's now taken things too far by stripping down to the short and curlies - something he appears to have plenty of - for the sake of the Daily Star's \"MegaStar\" campaign. The poster features a nude - and rather flushed - Mr Brown covering (just) his modesty with a board advertising the site. Mark Cranmer, chief executive at Starcom Motive and a dear friend of his, said: \"Kevin has a long history of exhibiting himself. He's done ads promoting gambling, alcohol and now blatant sex. I feel he should have asked for his legs to be retouched, though, because he seems to be suffering from the skinny legs/fat gut syndrome that comes to all men as they get older. I love Kevin, but he is mad.\" Even one of Kevin's co-founders is advising people to turn a blind eye to the stunt. \"I wouldn't look at it if I were you - you might find it offensive,\" he said. You're not wrong, Duncan. Caught out on a techie point Programmers panning TV shows? Geeks up in arms about TV stars? What the heck is going on? Anyone would think the BBC had made a show about a dot.com start-up. TV audiences may be unimpressed by This Life 2, the one set in a new media start-up and called Attachments, but those whose lives BBC2 is trying to mimic are even more unimpressed. True, World Productions may have done some homework, but those finicky techies are taking umbrage at any slight faux pas - such as transferring files by throwing floppy disks across the office and talking about downloads and demos as a revenue model.

They were thrashed by South Africa in the quarter-finals in Kenya by eight wickets after a dismal batting performance in which they lost their last six wickets for 28 and were dismissed for 182 with 35 balls remaining. It left South Africa needing to score at just 3.66 an over to secure a semi-final clash with India on Friday, and, despite a slight wobble at 52 for 2, they did it with ease as Jacques Kallis hit a controlled 78 and Boeta Dippenaar a more adventurous 65. </p> <p>England's bowlers needed to save runs and take early wickets if they were to disrupt one of the world's longest batting line-ups. Neither happened. Andy Caddick did begin with a maiden, but Darren Gough undid the good work by conceding nine in his first over as Gary Kirsten worked one ball through square-leg and cut another for four. In the next over he chopped a no-ball to the third-man boundary and guided Caddick through point for four more. </p> <p>South Africa lost Andrew Hall to Gough as a cut shot flew into Graeme Hick's bucket-like hands at second slip for 1 (19 for 1), but Kallis was immediately into his stride. He stood up on his toes to force Caddick for four through the covers on the up, and hit sweetly through mid-on in Caddick's next over. Kirsten, playing with untypical aggression, flicked Gough powerfully over square-leg, then creamed a no-ball to the long-on boundary. </p> <p>After eight overs South Africa were cruising at 43 for 1. England, at the same stage, had been 5 for 0. England's opening bowlers were poor. Gough overstepped four times, while Caddick had one of those days when he seems too easily dispirited. </p> <p>And it took a bowling change to change England's fortunes. With his second ball Craig White snared Kirsten for 32 as Hick held on brilliantly to a fierce cut with his left-hand (usually his weaker side) to leave South Africa 52 for 2. </p> <p>But that was about as good as it got. Kallis worked White's slower ball through midwicket for four in the same over, and the runs began to flow again. Kallis was particularly merciless against anything pitched even fractionally short outside off, while Dippenaar grew in confidence, off- and on-driving Caddick for four in the same over. </p> <p>The 100 came up in the 21st over as Kallis drove White through the covers, and Kallis moved to 50 soon after, having taken just 59 balls. Paul Grayson made some amends for his first-baller and a couple of misfields with some tidy overs of left-arm spin (five overs for 20), but by this stage the batsmen were in cruise control, picking off the singles at three an over and hammering the odd loose ball to the boundary. With the required run-rate never a problem, Kallis was able to play his normal game as Dippenaar accelerated. And when he ended the game with a straight six off White, South Africa had won with more than ten overs to spare. </p> <p>Earlier England batted with a death wish: four batsmen (Alec Stewart, Graham Thorpe, Andy Flintoff and Graeme Hick) holed out at deep square leg and two (Craig White and Andy Caddick) were run out by direct hits. Another, Grayson, lunged weakly outside off and fell to his first ball in international cricket. It was grim stuff from a side that can still collapse with the worst of them. </p> <p>But at 154 for 4 in the 37th over, with Hick striking the ball cleanly and Flintoff lending solid support, England were on course for 240. Then Flintoff pulled Shaun Pollock straight to Lance Klusener in the deep for 25 and things went quickly downhill. White set off for a single to the right of Jonty Rhodes, prowling at point, and paid the price (160 for 6), and when Hick's pull flew unerringly to Andrew Hall on the legside boundary in the next over, England were in deep trouble at 167 for 7. Hick, on, 65, was their last hope for some sort of score. </p> <p>Grayson groped at his first ball and edged to first slip (168 for 8), and Caddick chose the wrong moment to forget how to run a quick single as Boje hit the stumps from point (174 for 9). The rout was complete with almost six overs to spare when Mark Ealham fended Pollock to Mark Boucher. </p> <p> <em>Lawrence Booth is assistant editor of wisden.com</em></p>",

Like many similar families, the Bandaranaikes were thoroughly anglicised and held prominent positions in the colonial regime.</p> <p>Sirima, the eldest of six children, was sent at the age of eight to an English-language convent boarding-school in Colombo. But her parents ensured that she remained a devout Buddhist and spoke Sinhala as fluently as English. After leaving school she threw herself into social welfare work, walking miles through jungles and over mountains to distribute food and medicines, organise clinics and develop village industries. She became a great favourite of the Sinhalese peasantry, acquiring a reputation which proved politically invaluable.</p> <p>In 1940 she married Solomon West Ridgeway Dias Bandaranaike, an Oxford-educated minister in the colonial government. Both were from the top goyigama caste of landowners.</p> <p>Sirima was a valued confidante to her husband, persuading him to resign from the government and the ruling United National party (UNP) in 1951. Two months later he formed the Sri Lankan Freedom party (SLFP) with democratic socialism and Sinhalese resurgence at its heart.</p> <p>In general elections the following year she helped her husband win the biggest majority of any seat won by his party. She campaigned in his constituency while he concentrated on the rest of the country. At the next elections in 1956, Bandaranaike won by a landslide and formed a leftwing coalition government. He had promised to replace English with Sinhala as the island's sole official language, a watershed in the country's history. This was aimed against the dominance of the English-speaking elite, but also sowed the seeds of bitter conflicts with the Tamils. Bandaranaike used Sinhalese chauvinism to gain power, but could not control it.</p> <p>His prejudice also played a part in his murder in 1959 by a Buddhist monk. Mrs Bandaranaike was given little time to grieve in peace. The following year she succumbed to the SLFP's pleas to assume the party leadership, and led it to victory on a wave of sympathy.</p> <p>Over the next four years, the world's first woman prime minister forged ahead with her husband's socialist reform programme. The island was thrust into the emerging Non-Aligned Movement; foreign oil companies were nationalised and all government business was transferred from foreign banks to the state-owned Bank of Ceylon and the new People's Bank, bringing an end to US aid. Soviet aid was sought for industrialisation projects and education was reformed in favour of the Buddhist Sinhalese.</p> <p>But under pressure from rightwing Buddhist leaders, some SLFP MPs crossed the floor and the government collapsed at the end of 1964. She lost the next year's elections, but was herself elected to parliament for the first time.</p> <p>In 1970 the United Left Front led by the SLFP won a two-thirds majority in parliament. But in 1971 the leftwing People's Liberation Front launched an insurrection in protest against unemployment. This rebellion was swiftly crushed, though at the cost of an estimated 1,000 lives. More than 10,000 were jailed, but most were later released. Deeply shaken, the government pressed on with land reform, the nationalisation of the tea estates and a new republican constitution, which changed Ceylon's name to Sri Lanka and made Buddhism the state religion - to the dismay of the mainly Hindu Tamils.</p> <p>Mrs Bandaranaike also imposed rigid state control over the economy. Under the impact of soaring oil prices, living standards collapsed in a welter of rationing, bureaucracy and corruption. Her SLFP was routed in the 1977 elections. The UNP, led by JR Jayawardene, secured a 75% majority, which he used to tighten the authoritarian regime Mrs Bandaranaike had imposed in her second term. He revised the 1972 constitution and had himself elected executive president. In 1980 he had her civic rights suspended for seven years for abuse of power.</p> <p>With Mrs Bandaranaike unable to play any public role, the SLFP was riven by discord. In the difficult years ahead her main task was to hold the party together. Succession to the party leadership became a bone of contention between her son Anura, who was moving to the right, and her daughter Chandrika, who formed her own leftwing party with her popular film star husband Vijaya Kumaranatunga. One of the new party's main aims was to seek a rapprochement with the Tamils.</p> <p>With her civic rights restored in 1985, Mrs Bandaranaike recovered her place as unchallenged leader and the SLFP's fortunes rose again.

      "body": "<p>Magazine publisher Future Networks has discovered an apparent black hole in the accounts of its French subsidiary, leading to a 24% slump in its stock market value yesterday. </p> <p>The company, which owns the internet magazine Business 2.0, said discrepancies had been identified by management in its French operation at the end of last week. Initial findings suggest that sales of certain titles have been overstated by \u00a33.2m over three years. </p> <p>The discovery compounded an already tough couple of months for Future which has watched its share price fall from 900p at the start of August. Yesterday the price fell 140p to 445p. </p> <p>Greg Ingham, Future's chief executive, said the situation was frustrating, but main tained that it had no effect on the underlying business. \"This is obviously a significant hit but it shouldn't fundamentally alter our story.\" he said. \"The real value in our business is the future potential for growth and the ability to come up with good ideas.\" </p> <p>Accountancy firm Deloitte &amp; Touche was brought in at the end of last week to verify the findings and will continue a fuller investigation. The company has not suspended any staff over the affair and Mr Ingham said there appeared no cause to notify the police. </p> <p>\"We are still trying to fully understand what has happened here, to collate and analyse all the necessary information. It seems to be an issue of competence as opposed to malice or fraud,\" he said. </p> <p>Initial checks have been carried out in other parts of the business to make sure that similar problems do not exist elsewhere. France contributed 10% of revenues in the most recent set of figures issued by the company and 5% of operating profits. </p> <p>One analyst conceded that the amount was small in the context of a company which last year recorded revenues of \u00a3174m but said it had depressed sentiment around the company. Operating profits last year were \u00a323m. </p> <p>Future is closely identified with the hi-tech sector through many of its best selling titles and has weathered many of the same negative changes in investor attitude. </p> <p>Mr Ingham said measures were being taken to ensure there would be no repeat of the problem. Extra financial managers are being employed. </p> <p>Future bought the French business, then known as Edicorp, in spring 1998.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Magazine publisher Future Networks has discovered an apparent black hole in the accounts of its French subsidiary, leading to a 24% slump in its stock market value yesterday. The company, which owns the internet magazine Business 2.0, said discrepancies had been identified by management in its French operation at the end of last week. Initial findings suggest that sales of certain titles have been overstated by \u00a33.2m over three years. The discovery compounded an already tough couple of months for Future which has watched its share price fall from 900p at the start of August. Yesterday the price fell 140p to 445p. Greg Ingham, Future's chief executive, said the situation was frustrating, but main tained that it had no effect on the underlying business. \"This is obviously a significant hit but it shouldn't fundamentally alter our story.\" he said. \"The real value in our business is the future potential for growth and the ability to come up with good ideas.\" Accountancy firm Deloitte &amp; Touche was brought in at the end of last week to verify the findings and will continue a fuller investigation. The company has not suspended any staff over the affair and Mr Ingham said there appeared no cause to notify the police. \"We are still trying to fully understand what has happened here, to collate and analyse all the necessary information. It seems to be an issue of competence as opposed to malice or fraud,\" he said. Initial checks have been carried out in other parts of the business to make sure that similar problems do not exist elsewhere. France contributed 10% of revenues in the most recent set of figures issued by the company and 5% of operating profits. One analyst conceded that the amount was small in the context of a company which last year recorded revenues of \u00a3174m but said it had depressed sentiment around the company. Operating profits last year were \u00a323m. Future is closely identified with the hi-tech sector through many of its best selling titles and has weathered many of the same negative changes in investor attitude. Mr Ingham said measures were being taken to ensure there would be no repeat of the problem. Extra financial managers are being employed. Future bought the French business, then known as Edicorp, in spring 1998.",

      "body": "<p>Just when you think you have heard the worst from the chamber of horrors that passes for the capital punishment system in the US, yet another chilling tale of wrongful conviction emerges from death row.</p> <p>The latest such story comes from Virginia, where Earl Washington, a man with the mental age of a young teenager, has spent 17 years in prison for a murder and rape he did not commit, once coming within five days of execution.</p> <p>DNA tests that proved conclusively that he was innocent of the crime finally led to a pardon last week. When his lawyer told him, he said: \"Whew, I told everybody I didn't do that. I guess I'm freed now.\"</p> <p>His lawyer had to tell him that he was not free. He still had to serve the rest of a 30-year sentence for another crime - hitting a neighbour over the head with a chair and stealing three dollars.</p> <p>\"Well, I've learned not to build my hopes and I'll just wait,\" Washington said. His lawyers are still fighting to get him out. He is now 39 years old. Washington's legal team had the exculpatory DNA evidence years ago. But in Virginia, if you cannot present evidence of innocence within 21 days of conviction, it is inadmissible.</p> <p>If you have DNA evidence, eyewitness testimony, even a confession from the real killer, and you arrive 22 days after a death sentence has been pronounced, you have no recourse in the normal appeal court system. A handful of other states have similar laws, but Virginia's time limit is the shortest.</p> <p>DNA testing has so far cleared 76 prisoners, including nine former death row inmates, of their crimes, but it is far from universally accepted. In some states, the criminal justice system jealously guards its convictions and is loathe to reopen cases.You cannot just keep the courts tied up indefinitely with old convictions, the prosecutors and the police often argue.</p> <p>Just before the DNA evidence proved Washington innocent, the local police chief, CB Jones, told journalists: \"It has been proved that he was guilty by a court of law and we keep trying the same case. Where is the end?\"</p> <p>In Texas two years ago, the appeal court refused to grant Roy Criner a new trial, even after DNA tests demonstrated that he was not responsible for the rape and murder he had been convicted of. His DNA did not match the semen found in the body.

      "bodyText": "Just when you think you have heard the worst from the chamber of horrors that passes for the capital punishment system in the US, yet another chilling tale of wrongful conviction emerges from death row. The latest such story comes from Virginia, where Earl Washington, a man with the mental age of a young teenager, has spent 17 years in prison for a murder and rape he did not commit, once coming within five days of execution. DNA tests that proved conclusively that he was innocent of the crime finally led to a pardon last week. When his lawyer told him, he said: \"Whew, I told everybody I didn't do that. I guess I'm freed now.\" His lawyer had to tell him that he was not free. He still had to serve the rest of a 30-year sentence for another crime - hitting a neighbour over the head with a chair and stealing three dollars. \"Well, I've learned not to build my hopes and I'll just wait,\" Washington said. His lawyers are still fighting to get him out. He is now 39 years old. Washington's legal team had the exculpatory DNA evidence years ago. But in Virginia, if you cannot present evidence of innocence within 21 days of conviction, it is inadmissible. If you have DNA evidence, eyewitness testimony, even a confession from the real killer, and you arrive 22 days after a death sentence has been pronounced, you have no recourse in the normal appeal court system. A handful of other states have similar laws, but Virginia's time limit is the shortest. DNA testing has so far cleared 76 prisoners, including nine former death row inmates, of their crimes, but it is far from universally accepted. In some states, the criminal justice system jealously guards its convictions and is loathe to reopen cases.You cannot just keep the courts tied up indefinitely with old convictions, the prosecutors and the police often argue. Just before the DNA evidence proved Washington innocent, the local police chief, CB Jones, told journalists: \"It has been proved that he was guilty by a court of law and we keep trying the same case. Where is the end?\" In Texas two years ago, the appeal court refused to grant Roy Criner a new trial, even after DNA tests demonstrated that he was not responsible for the rape and murder he had been convicted of. His DNA did not match the semen found in the body. It was possible, the judges argued, that Criner had indeed committed the rape and used a condom. He was only freed in August after tests matched DNA from cigarette butts found at the scene to the semen. After another man was exonerated of a rape charge with DNA evidence, the local Texas county destroyed forensic evidence from 50 other cases. Just tidying up, county officials said. For some, of course, DNA testing comes too late. The family of Joe O'Dell is still fighting to prove his innocence of a rape and murder conviction more than two years after he was executed in Virginia. They wanted a DNA test, but were told that court officials had tossed the forensic evidence into an incinerator. Even if they had not, it has been hitherto impossible to convince a US court to order posthumous DNA tests after an execution. There is almost certainly a connection between this policy and the argument advanced by death penalty supporters that no one in recent years has been proved to have been wrongfully executed.",

That's my only reservation. Choice: Peter Taylor, he's ideal David Elleray Premiership referee I want the FA to appoint somebody and get the best out of the players. I wouldn't have any objections to that person being foreign; nationality does not come into it. Choice: No one springs to mind Lord Hattersley Lifelong Sheffield Wednesday fan I'd keep it in England because of the damage it would do the morale of our supporters and players if we said no one here was up to it. We need a tough, ideally northern, Englishman. Choice: Step forward Bobby Robson Yvonne Fletcher LutonTown director I see absolutely no reason why not if that is the best person for the job. Maybe if we had someone who wasn't English it would cut down on the xenophobia of some of the supporters Choice: Ars\u00e8ne Wenger John McCririck TV racing expert and Newcastle fan We cannot have all that xenophobic nonsense about not having a foreigner. That is from the Dark Ages. Choice: Sir Alex Ferguson or Bobby Robson (and allow them to carry on with their club management as well) Jonathan Pearce Radio and TV commentator People like Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and G\u00e9rard Houllier have brought something special into our game. But you would have to have someone English working alongside them Choice: Terry Venables Walter Winterbottom England manager 1946-62 The problem is there is a shortage of English managers to do the job. So in that respect there is nothing wrong with having a foreign coach.But I'd prefer to see an English manager in charge. Choice: At 87, I'm ruling myself out Bryan Robson Middlesbrough manager and former England captain They should not appoint a foreigner. Terry Venables should never have been allowed to leave. If the FA have any sense they will put him in charge. Choice: Terry Venables Paul Parker Former England international The FA must realise that we should be building towards 2006 now rather than 2002. We should look at it as a development, rather than ridiculously thinking we are still a major force Choice: Peter Taylor The candidates Ruled in Terry Venables 5-2 fav Howard Wilkinson 6-1 Ruled out Aim\u00e9 Jacquet 7-1 Peter Reid 10-1 Peter Taylor 12-1 G\u00e9rard Houllier 25-1 Bobby Robson 16-1 Bryan Robson 10-1 Walter Winterbottom 100-1 Non-committal Ars\u00e8ne Wenger 7-1 Fabio Capello 16-1 Marcelo Lippi 20-1 Martin O'Neill 16-1 Odds supplied by Coral \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

But he said: \"I have no intention to return to the playing field in high-level soccer in England or elsewhere.\" </p> <p>Bryan Robson, the Middlesbrough manager, said: \"My name is not in the hat. If I get offered or would like the job of England manager I want to have good experience behind me as a league manager and, hopefully, success.\" </p> <p>Taylor, the former England Under-21 coach, also declined. \"It is not for me at the moment. One day I would love to manage England but I would have to have earned it. I have only been at Leicester four months and this is too early for me.\" </p> <p>Sunderland's chairman Bob Murray said of Reid: \"Peter is an established and respected Premiership manager and only wants to continue to devote his future to Sunderland.\" </p> <p>Freddy Shepherd, the Newcastle chairman, similarly insisted Bobby Robson was staying. \"We could not contemplate his release, neither in the short nor long term.\" </p> <p>Aston Villa's John Gregory has not really done enough to warrant consideration, the same goes for David O'Leary at Leeds, and Martin O'Neill has only just moved to his beloved Celtic. Meanwhile Sir Alex Ferguson has pledged himself to Manchester United for another full season before retiring. </p> <p>The leading foreign candidate is the Roma coach Fabio Capello, who turned Milan into a major power in the 90s and is the FA technical director Howard Wilkinson's choice. Another Italian being touted is the former Internazionale coach Marcello Lippi, but he does not speak English. </p> <p>More plausible is the Rangers manager Dick Advocaat. He lifted the Dutch title with PSV, has won five trophies in 2 years at Ibrox, has managed Holland and has only a year left on his current contract. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "bodyText": "The already skinny list of candidates to succeed Kevin Keegan was pruned by five yesterday when Aim\u00e9 Jacquet, Peter Taylor, Peter Reid, Bryan Robson and Bobby Robson were ruled out of contention for the England job. And Arsenal's chairman Peter Hill-Wood invited the Football Association to approach Ars\u00e8ne Wenger but said: \"I can tell them he wouldn't say yes to the job\". The bookmakers immediately slashed the odds on their favourite Terry Venables to 2-1, even though the former England coach has several detractors at the Football Association. Jacquet, who won the 1998 World Cup with France, is now the national technical director for the French football federation. But he said: \"I have no intention to return to the playing field in high-level soccer in England or elsewhere.\" Bryan Robson, the Middlesbrough manager, said: \"My name is not in the hat. If I get offered or would like the job of England manager I want to have good experience behind me as a league manager and, hopefully, success.\" Taylor, the former England Under-21 coach, also declined. \"It is not for me at the moment. One day I would love to manage England but I would have to have earned it. I have only been at Leicester four months and this is too early for me.\" Sunderland's chairman Bob Murray said of Reid: \"Peter is an established and respected Premiership manager and only wants to continue to devote his future to Sunderland.\" Freddy Shepherd, the Newcastle chairman, similarly insisted Bobby Robson was staying. \"We could not contemplate his release, neither in the short nor long term.\" Aston Villa's John Gregory has not really done enough to warrant consideration, the same goes for David O'Leary at Leeds, and Martin O'Neill has only just moved to his beloved Celtic. Meanwhile Sir Alex Ferguson has pledged himself to Manchester United for another full season before retiring. The leading foreign candidate is the Roma coach Fabio Capello, who turned Milan into a major power in the 90s and is the FA technical director Howard Wilkinson's choice. Another Italian being touted is the former Internazionale coach Marcello Lippi, but he does not speak English. More plausible is the Rangers manager Dick Advocaat. He lifted the Dutch title with PSV, has won five trophies in 2 years at Ibrox, has managed Holland and has only a year left on his current contract. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

But the kids hanging out on Blackbird Leys Road seem in little need of advice. Bobby Ahmed, 21, and Delroy Thomas, 20, both unemployed, enjoy a smoke. \"For me it's a mind soother,\" said Delroy. Pot helps them to beat the boredom of long days looking for work. The real scourges of the estate, they say, are crack cocaine and heroin. \"Pot doesn't make you mug people like the crackheads and brownheads [heroin users],\" said Mr Thomas. \"You see the addicts ducking past here with their hoods and caps pulled down real low. We call them 'cats' because they are always over fences and ducking round cars. The cats would rob their grannies for a fix,\" said Mr Ahmed. \"Police should be nicking them, not puff dealers. We know someone, he works five days a week, then sells a bit of gear to pay for the electric and cover the cost of a smoke - he got arrested, while the cats are looking forward to Christmas and easy pickings from people's houses. It's crazy.\"",

This year the UKAEA was fined a total of \u00a3101,000 for safety breaches at the plant after pleading guilty to three charges of contaminating workers with excessive doses of radiation in 1995. It also admitted a separate charge relating to safety when a contractor accidentally dug through a main power cable, knocking out the electricity supply. In 1998, an audit by the health and safety executive made 143 recommendations for improvements. Most recently, a study that was not made public for six years found that levels of plutonium in the homes of Dounreay workers were significantly higher than in other homes in the areas. And since 1984 hundreds of radioactive particles have been found near the facility. In 1998 Donald Dewar, then Scottish secretary, announced the plant would close in 2004.

The Department of Trade and Industry is assessing the best way to dispose of it, through storage, transferring it to Sellafield or re-processing it at Dounreay. Lorraine Mann, of Scotland Against Nuclear Dumping, said the plant would continue to cast shadows over the area.\"They keep saying it is nothing to be concerned about but what they have there is extremely dangerous stuff and there is a pretty deep tide of real concern about it.\" The environmental group Friends of the Earth says re-processing would be the worst option.

The deposing of Milosevic is the vindication of a strategy for which he risked more than anyone else in the west. He was the moral, if not the military, leader of what saved Kosovo, and has now led to the despatch of the tyrant. This is both stirring and alarming. Before we get to the alarm, though, we should mark an unusual moment of success for a foreign policy. The Nato intervention in Bosnia and Kosovo attracted immense and righteous attack, not least because it didn't seem to get anywhere. Now it has got somewhere, and the jibers still can't stand it.</p> <p>Certain simple truths have always been self-evident, though often evaded. First, if Milosevic had carried ethnic slaughter through Kosovo without Nato's intervention, he would almost certainly still be in power in Belgrade. It's unlikely, after reclaiming Serbia's emotional heartland from the Kosovo Albanians, that he would even have been challenged. Second, if he had remained supreme, it is very probable that south-east Europe would have descended into destructive turmoil. Albania, Macedonia and Greece were the dominoes exposed to the repercussions of Milosevic's destabilising activities to the north. Those were two immensely serious contingencies. The Balkans, ablaze on Nato's southern flank, would have threatened the peace of the world.</p> <p>So, as well as paving the way for a people's peaceful revolution, Nato did something for civilisation in Europe. The method was war, and it imposed indiscriminate brutalities on some innocent Serbs and Kosovo Albanians. It was in no way a pretty sight. Some terrible mistakes were made, so terrible that they have tended to overshadow the wider purpose. And this purpose was long in being achieved. Now that it has happened, we find critics straining to deny it. The truth is that however messy, however delayed, however costly, and however incalculable the outcome may be for Kosovo itself, the war was indispensable to the possibility of a genuine Balkan peace.</p> <p>Mr Blair played a big part in that. Ask any American close to the scene at the time. At home, though he was shoulder to shoulder with Robin Cook, the cabinet was, as usual, not involved. In Nato, the doubts of the collective needed regularly purging by the nerveless lucidity of the British leader. In Washington, President Clinton's hesitations and domestic problems were put sternly to the question from London. On his own visit to the Balkans, Blair made clear that his impulses were as much prophetic as pragmatic. \"Our promise to all of you is that you shall return in peace to the land that is yours,\" he told a massive audience of Kosovo Albanian refugees camped in Macedonia.</p> <p>He was getting ready to commit 50,000 British fighting troops, if Serbia did not desist. Though Clinton remained in thrall to the modern US doctrine that only air wars are politically feasible, Blair today remains convinced that, if necessary, American soldiers too would have taken the field. Clinton, he thinks, was ultimately ready for it. But Milosevic spared them that, and pulled out of Kosovo. It was the beginning of the end of the dictator's invincibility, which was finally buried by the people last week.</p> <p>This history is likely to reinforce a trend. Mr Blair proves to be a natural intervener. Intervention for humanitarian reasons, or to make good the incompetence of failed states that cannot protect their own people, or a mixture of both, is turning out to be a more conspicuous aspect of his moral personality than anything he does here. At home he is an indifferent spectator of the lives of the hopeless and deprived, wishing them only to brace up and work. Abroad, he sees zones of human crisis, far from Britain's interest but sometimes close to her historic legacy, where the benign hand of paternalistic friendship should expensively stretch out.</p> <p>The current example is Sierra Leone, where Britain has now decided, having removed one lot of her soldiers, to send further reinforcements for those left behind. We seem to be there for the long haul, after all. There are defensible reasons for this, not least that Sierra Leone is keen on it. It's also the case that the United Nations, as Sierra Leone among other places shows, has been stretched to breaking point. The security council passes peacekeeping resolutions which its members then refuse to support with troops. Kofi Annan signalled not long ago that he favoured a more hard-headed approach, leaving an opening for the kind of selective, swift, competent, military operations Mr Blair seems to have assumed as a kind of bilateral British duty.</p> <p>The secretary-general is gloomy about the traditional UN method, which has proved inadequate in Africa especially - though East Timor, against the odds, proved a more encouraging case. \"The time has come,\" he told Jim Hoagland of the Washington Post recently, \"for us to base our planning on worst-case scenarios.

Its outcome, with the installation of President Kostunica, is far from final: it will, in some ways, complicate the future of Kosovo as any kind of informal Nato protectorate, for example. But the war, I think (as a supporter of it at the time), now receives its final justification.

It has poured more than $11m (\u00a37.8m) into the presidential campaign - mainly to George W Bush who opposes the scheme, but about a third to Al Gore in the hope he will feel beholden to the industry if elected and perhaps water down the plan. In a close race like this, it pays to hedge your bets. For that reason, the industry has ploughed many millions more into congressional races.</p> <p>The gulf between Flo's kindly face and the hard-edged bottom-line war she is fighting in is a fitting illustration of the two parallel elections underway in the US. One is a contest of personalities and a menu of user-friendly policies that fills the airwaves and news bulletins. The other is practically invisible and pits two loose coalitions of corporations and interest groups against each other in a struggle to decide how money will be made and who will make it under the next administration.</p> <p>The map of the visible election is familiar. It is the patchwork of states coloured in different shades to represent their allegiances. The other, largely invisible, electoral map shows how corporate America has lined up for contest - the most money-driven election in US history.</p> <p>Larry Makinson, head of the Centre for Responsive Politics which monitors the role of money in the campaign, said the sheer amount of cash involved owed a lot to the closeness of the race. The corporations, he explained, \"don't know who to lobby because they don't know who's going to be in control and both parties are trying to raise money like gangbusters. And so they're calling in chits.\"</p> <p>But after the election, it is corporate America that will call in its chits, and - if recent political history is anything to go by - much of the new administration's policy will be guided by the bets placed by big business during the campaign.</p> <p>In some cases, the policy issues are the same in both the visible and invisible elections. The future of Medicare has been exhaustively debated, even though the trade association, whose \"public service\" broadcasts are helping shape that debate, is rarely identified.</p> <p>However, many of the key battles which determine the struggle over big money are not fought in the open. They concern issues such as tort reform and financial deregulation, which sound obscure and tedious, but which represent billions of dollars to both parties' financial backers.</p> <p>The story is often told of how George W Bush came almost out of nowhere to win the Texas governorship in 1994 from a popular Democratic incumbent, Anne Richards. It is often explained in terms of Mr Bush's optimistic never-say-die nature and his easy manner with ordinary Texans.</p> <p>But it had a lot to do with one campaign pledge. \"Probably the first and most important thing I will do when I am governor of this state,\" he promised, \"is to insist Texas changes the tort laws and insist we end the frivolous and junk lawsuits that threaten our producers and crowd our courts.\"</p> <p>True to his word, he signed a string of tort reform bills in his first few weeks in office. Tort reform means making it harder for consumers to sue large corporations. If he becomes president, Bush and his backers mean to put industries such as tobacco, guns, oil and medicine far beyond the reach of the lawsuits which have had the corporations pinned down in the courts for years.</p> <p>The Bush tort reform proposals would limit victims' rights of access to the court system and cap the amount of damages they could be awarded if they did manage to bring a case to court.</p> <p>The effect in Texas was dramatic. When a San Antonio jury tried to award a widow $42.5m after lax oil company safety procedures had resulted in the death of her husband, an oil refinery worker, the Bush tort reform laws meant the company paid just $200,000.</p> <p>Mr Bush's tort reform pledge flooded his 1994 campaign with corporate funds, and is doing the same now. It is bringing in cash from almost every corporate sector which feels vulnerable to the US people's litigious instincts - financial services, insurance, tobacco, pharmaceuticals and oil, the list is endless and explains the Republican candidate's extraordinary lead in the money stakes. The anti-corporate third party candidate, Ralph Nader, often refers to Mr Bush as a \"corporation disguised as a human being\".</p> <p>Mr Bush had raised a record $170m by the end of August and must be heading towards $200m by the election on November 7. Over half his campaign funding is \"hard money\" - individual donations subject to a limit of $1,000 given directly to his campaign coffers. These donations are often \"bundled\" together by firms or interest groups in the names of their members or employees.</p> <p>The rest is \"soft money\" which can be given to each party's national committee to promote \"issues\". These issues are not supposed to be directly related to the election campaign, and so are not subject to cash limits. But it is a transparent veil. The money and the advertising it funds almost always goes to support the presidential candidates.</p> <p>Vice-president Gore has raised more soft money than hard but altogether he has little more than half the financial resources of his opponent. His key backers are the lawyers, who fear tort reform as much as Mr Bush's corporate sponsors crave it. In most class-action lawsuits - against gun manufacturers, tobacco, the construction industry or whomever - the lawyers keep a third of the financial award. Each year in US courts that accounts for a huge sum of money and the legal industry has invested nearly $12m in Mr Gore to make sure its members are not deprived of it.</p> <p><b> Alienating industries</b><br></p> <p>Mr Gore's and the Democrats' close association with the trial lawyers has, however, inflicted strategic costs elsewhere, alienating industries that might otherwise be sympathetic, such as the computer and dot.com industry.</p> <p>Silicon Valley is this year's emerging big player on the election Monopoly-board, contributing $10m to the presidential campaigns alone. The Clinton Democrats have long held an edge here, as they have generally opposed initiatives to tax the internet. Furthermore, the relaxed liberal California lifestyle which is home to many in the industry is conducive to Democratic support. Democratic primacy is being challenged however, as the big computer and internet firms worry about the threat of shareholder lawsuits, by which individual owners of company stock have sued firms for sudden plunges in its value, a frequent occurrence in the volatile hi-tech sector.</p> <p>The huge financial sector is also tilting away from Mr Gore. The banks and investment houses have traditionally been \"double-givers\", backing politicians on both sides, to make sure government stayed out of their business.

Any fine therefore will be held in abeyance until April next year. The potential fine of \u00a335m, which would be the largest in corporate history, is based on \u00a32m levied by the regulator for every 1% of underperformance. So far Railtrack is more than 17.8% adrift of the regulator's guidelines. Railtrack was fined \u00a310m by the regulator earlier this year for failing to meet passenger targets. Following criticism that he was adopting a confrontational approach, Mr Winsor reviewed the position. He has decided to give the company a \"second chance'.'

Mr Corbett said that the company was delivering record levels of investment, with an increase of 36% to \u00a31.2bn in the first half of the year. Incidents of trains passing signals at red have started to rise again, but Mr Corbett said that the overall record had been generally good. Security alerts at Victoria and Paddington stations in central London, and serious delays through emergencies in other parts of the country, have led to considerable losses in time. Fatalities and trespass caused a 30% increase in delays, while delays due to collisions with bridges rose by 16%. Railtrack's poor performance has been underlined by figures from the shadow strategic rail authority showing that Railtrack and the 25 train companies have had a disastrous summer. Apart from pressure from the regulator on Railrack, the rail companies could also face stricter financial penalties from the SSRA for failing to run trains on time or to operate them at all.

      "body": "<p>The first question the receptionist asks visitors to Smith-Kline Beecham's Philadelphia nerve centre is: \"Are you from Glaxo Wellcome?\" </p> <p>Glaxo employees, once considered enemies, are infiltrating the building like a virus - they only need to show proof of their employment to get in. </p> <p>Everything is ready for the long-delayed merger of the two firms. In SmithKline's reception hall, glass cabinets display products such as Aquafresh and Ribena. There are gaps inside, ready and waiting for Glaxo's contribution. </p> <p>Signs bearing the name Glaxo SmithKline have been ordered, ready to adorn the outside of the building. The company has stocked up with new headed notepaper, the secretaries have been drilled on how to answer the phones post-merger and a video-link for staff with chief executive Jean-Pierre Garnier has been arranged, and postponed. </p> <p>This is no ordinary deal. The merger will create Britain's largest drugs company, employing 107,000 people. But at the whim of the federal trade commission, the combination still hangs in the balance. The commission wants more information about the two companies' smoking cessation products, which may or may not command an unacceptably large market share. </p> <p>The merger is intended to create annual cost savings of \u00a31bn - which means that for every day of waiting, the two firms spend\u00a327m more than they would as a combined entity. Yet the sticking point officially surrounds just Smith-Kline's Nicorette gum and Nicoderm patches, which have daily sales of less than \u00a31m. </p> <p>The FTC believes the two nicotine replacement products could clash with Glaxo's Zyban - a prescription drug which acts to reduce the craving for cigarettes. Lawyers in Washington are examining advertising material to see if they target the same customers or whether, as Glaxo claims, Zyban is mainly for last-gasp struggling quitters. </p> <p>The official line is banal - a SmithKline spokeswoman says: \"Of course there's disappointment about the hold-up, but on the whole people are just getting on with the job.

      "bodyText": "The first question the receptionist asks visitors to Smith-Kline Beecham's Philadelphia nerve centre is: \"Are you from Glaxo Wellcome?\" Glaxo employees, once considered enemies, are infiltrating the building like a virus - they only need to show proof of their employment to get in. Everything is ready for the long-delayed merger of the two firms. In SmithKline's reception hall, glass cabinets display products such as Aquafresh and Ribena. There are gaps inside, ready and waiting for Glaxo's contribution. Signs bearing the name Glaxo SmithKline have been ordered, ready to adorn the outside of the building. The company has stocked up with new headed notepaper, the secretaries have been drilled on how to answer the phones post-merger and a video-link for staff with chief executive Jean-Pierre Garnier has been arranged, and postponed. This is no ordinary deal. The merger will create Britain's largest drugs company, employing 107,000 people. But at the whim of the federal trade commission, the combination still hangs in the balance. The commission wants more information about the two companies' smoking cessation products, which may or may not command an unacceptably large market share. The merger is intended to create annual cost savings of \u00a31bn - which means that for every day of waiting, the two firms spend\u00a327m more than they would as a combined entity. Yet the sticking point officially surrounds just Smith-Kline's Nicorette gum and Nicoderm patches, which have daily sales of less than \u00a31m. The FTC believes the two nicotine replacement products could clash with Glaxo's Zyban - a prescription drug which acts to reduce the craving for cigarettes. Lawyers in Washington are examining advertising material to see if they target the same customers or whether, as Glaxo claims, Zyban is mainly for last-gasp struggling quitters. The official line is banal - a SmithKline spokeswoman says: \"Of course there's disappointment about the hold-up, but on the whole people are just getting on with the job. Everybody is still focused on delivering results for Smith-Kline Beecham.\" Yet there is increasing scepticism about whether all is what it seems.

      "body": "<p>When Jasmina Jovanovic died during the recent tumultuous events in Serbia, the common reaction among people in Belgrade was that it was a small price to pay for change. Others have described her as the final victim of Slobodan Milosevic, whose 13 years of tyranny ended surprisingly peacefully last week.</p> <p>When Jovanovic died last Thursday, she became the only person to lose her life in the Serbian uprising. The 39-year-old law graduate was killed when she slipped from a trailer carrying a bulldozer to the demonstration outside the Federal Parliament building in the centre of the capital. Witnesses say it was a freak accident. Her rucksack slipped and pulled her under the wheels as pro-democracy protesters stormed the building. Staff at the Urgent Centar, Belgrade hospital's emergency clinic, say she was dead on arrival.</p> <p>Jovanovic was buried on Saturday in a small cemetery in her home village of Milosevac. But five days after her death, she has been virtually forgotten. As the new president, Vojislav Kostunica, attempts to assert his control of the country, news of her death has been limited to a few paragraphs on the inside pages of Serbian newspapers.</p> <p>Yet according to her friends and colleagues, Jovanovic was part of a group that was instrumental in helping to bring down the Milosevic regime. Her death, and more specifically the way it has been viewed since, is a reminder, according to some, that women have a very long way to go before they become an acceptable part of political life in Yugoslavia.</p> <p>Jovanovic spent her childhood in Milosevac, a village 40 miles from Belgrade, in an area regarded as the heartland of Serbia. Belgraders refer to it simply as being on \"the South track\" - an allusion to its lack of sophistication.</p> <p>The only daughter of two teachers, Jovanovic moved away from the village to study law in Belgrade where she remained until her death. In 1992 she became one of the first members of Vojislav Kostunica's Serbian Democratic Party. At a memorial service held for her on Sunday, the party's representative, Dragan Jocic, described her as being very active in all the opposition demonstrations since then. \"All the time she was working for change in Yugoslavia,\" he recalled when paying tribute to her.</p> <p>Jovanovic's friends say she had been looking forward to Thursday's demonstration for days. Thursday was the date the Democratic Opposition of Serbia had set as the deadline for Milosevic to step down from power. \"She had no fear, she was very brave,\" one friend is quoted as saying in the opposition daily newspaper Blic.</p> <p>One woman, however, can't help but think that coverage of Jasmina Jovanovic's death would have been very different if she had been a man. \"If a man was killed, very quickly the importance of his role in the democratic opposition in Serbia would be clear,\" says Biljana Vuco, president of the Yugoslav Lawyers Committee for Human Rights. \"There was no news about Jasmina's political involvement,\" she adds. \"I didn't even know she was a member of a political party.\"</p> <p>According to Vuco, most people's perception of politics in Yugoslavia is that it remains very much a man's domain. The country's three most dominant female politicians are identified as strong women - but none of them has a popular reputation. \"They are called bitches,\" Vuco explains. \"They are guilty of everything.\"</p> <p>Mira Markovic, the wife of Slobodan Milosevic, is the most obvious example, characterised as the Lady Macbeth of Serbia. But successful women in the Democratic Opposition get the same treatment. Danica Draskovic, the wife of Vuk Draskovic, president of the Serbian Renewal Party, and one of his closest advisers, is subject to numerous rumours about her personal life. Vesna Pesic, head of the Centre for Anti War Action, is respected among intellectuals but is not very popular outside those circles, Vuco says.</p> <p>\"The view is that they are in politics because they have personal problems,\" she explains. \"They are not good housewives or mothers. There is a common opinion that women have nothing to do with politics in Serbia.\"</p> <p>Jasmina Jovanovic, she argues, is therefore seen simply as a \"poor woman who died in a demonstration by accident\" and not as somebody who genuinely struggled to overthrow the Milosevic regime.</p> <p>Others are less critical. Goran Svilanovic is head of the Civic Alliance of Serbia, one of the many groups that made up the Democratic Opposition of Serbia. He believes that the failure of the press to give more coverage to Jovanovic's death has little to do with gender. \"Two men died at the same time, one of a heart attack and one of a stroke, and there is nothing about them in the papers,\" he points out, adding that it is communism and state control that has prevented the rise of women within Serbian politics.</p> <p>It is certainly the case that women did not fare well under the Milosevic regime. Since the Nato bombardment began in the spring of 1999, combined with the grinding effects of nearly a decade of economic sanctions, half the population has been living below the poverty line. Infant mortality has increased, as has prostitution and domestic violence. According to the UN, 25% of Serbian women felt it would be \"irresponsible\" to bear children in their nation while Milosevic remained in power.</p> <p>Lately, however, there has been evidence of an upsurge in women's activism. In the past year, 70% of all new non-governmental groups have been created by women.</p> <p>Svilanovic believes that the women of Serbia have yet to have their day. \"Everything has been controlled by the state,\" he says. \"Unions have been under state control or nonexistent.

      "bodyText": "When Jasmina Jovanovic died during the recent tumultuous events in Serbia, the common reaction among people in Belgrade was that it was a small price to pay for change. Others have described her as the final victim of Slobodan Milosevic, whose 13 years of tyranny ended surprisingly peacefully last week. When Jovanovic died last Thursday, she became the only person to lose her life in the Serbian uprising. The 39-year-old law graduate was killed when she slipped from a trailer carrying a bulldozer to the demonstration outside the Federal Parliament building in the centre of the capital. Witnesses say it was a freak accident. Her rucksack slipped and pulled her under the wheels as pro-democracy protesters stormed the building. Staff at the Urgent Centar, Belgrade hospital's emergency clinic, say she was dead on arrival. Jovanovic was buried on Saturday in a small cemetery in her home village of Milosevac. But five days after her death, she has been virtually forgotten. As the new president, Vojislav Kostunica, attempts to assert his control of the country, news of her death has been limited to a few paragraphs on the inside pages of Serbian newspapers. Yet according to her friends and colleagues, Jovanovic was part of a group that was instrumental in helping to bring down the Milosevic regime. Her death, and more specifically the way it has been viewed since, is a reminder, according to some, that women have a very long way to go before they become an acceptable part of political life in Yugoslavia. Jovanovic spent her childhood in Milosevac, a village 40 miles from Belgrade, in an area regarded as the heartland of Serbia. Belgraders refer to it simply as being on \"the South track\" - an allusion to its lack of sophistication. The only daughter of two teachers, Jovanovic moved away from the village to study law in Belgrade where she remained until her death. In 1992 she became one of the first members of Vojislav Kostunica's Serbian Democratic Party. At a memorial service held for her on Sunday, the party's representative, Dragan Jocic, described her as being very active in all the opposition demonstrations since then. \"All the time she was working for change in Yugoslavia,\" he recalled when paying tribute to her. Jovanovic's friends say she had been looking forward to Thursday's demonstration for days. Thursday was the date the Democratic Opposition of Serbia had set as the deadline for Milosevic to step down from power. \"She had no fear, she was very brave,\" one friend is quoted as saying in the opposition daily newspaper Blic. One woman, however, can't help but think that coverage of Jasmina Jovanovic's death would have been very different if she had been a man. \"If a man was killed, very quickly the importance of his role in the democratic opposition in Serbia would be clear,\" says Biljana Vuco, president of the Yugoslav Lawyers Committee for Human Rights. \"There was no news about Jasmina's political involvement,\" she adds. \"I didn't even know she was a member of a political party.\" According to Vuco, most people's perception of politics in Yugoslavia is that it remains very much a man's domain. The country's three most dominant female politicians are identified as strong women - but none of them has a popular reputation. \"They are called bitches,\" Vuco explains. \"They are guilty of everything.\" Mira Markovic, the wife of Slobodan Milosevic, is the most obvious example, characterised as the Lady Macbeth of Serbia. But successful women in the Democratic Opposition get the same treatment. Danica Draskovic, the wife of Vuk Draskovic, president of the Serbian Renewal Party, and one of his closest advisers, is subject to numerous rumours about her personal life. Vesna Pesic, head of the Centre for Anti War Action, is respected among intellectuals but is not very popular outside those circles, Vuco says. \"The view is that they are in politics because they have personal problems,\" she explains. \"They are not good housewives or mothers. There is a common opinion that women have nothing to do with politics in Serbia.\" Jasmina Jovanovic, she argues, is therefore seen simply as a \"poor woman who died in a demonstration by accident\" and not as somebody who genuinely struggled to overthrow the Milosevic regime. Others are less critical. Goran Svilanovic is head of the Civic Alliance of Serbia, one of the many groups that made up the Democratic Opposition of Serbia. He believes that the failure of the press to give more coverage to Jovanovic's death has little to do with gender. \"Two men died at the same time, one of a heart attack and one of a stroke, and there is nothing about them in the papers,\" he points out, adding that it is communism and state control that has prevented the rise of women within Serbian politics. It is certainly the case that women did not fare well under the Milosevic regime. Since the Nato bombardment began in the spring of 1999, combined with the grinding effects of nearly a decade of economic sanctions, half the population has been living below the poverty line. Infant mortality has increased, as has prostitution and domestic violence. According to the UN, 25% of Serbian women felt it would be \"irresponsible\" to bear children in their nation while Milosevic remained in power. Lately, however, there has been evidence of an upsurge in women's activism. In the past year, 70% of all new non-governmental groups have been created by women. Svilanovic believes that the women of Serbia have yet to have their day. \"Everything has been controlled by the state,\" he says. \"Unions have been under state control or nonexistent. It is the same for the bar association and the medical profession. It will take time, but women will gradually emerge.\" Back in Milosevac, Jovanovic's funeral was one of the biggest the area had seen in years. Death notices pasted to lamp-posts note that her death came on the day \"when democracy and freedom descended\". Her aunt, Ljiljla Peresic, says she had warned Jovanovic not to go to the demonstration, but she was determined. \"She wanted change and a normal life.\"",

      "bodyText": "Drug use is the strongest predictor of serious or persistent offending for boys aged 12-17, according to a Home Office survey of youth crime. The report, published yesterday, showed the odds of offending for drug-takers were nearly five times higher than for non-drug users. Boys who were disaffected from school or were persistent truants also had a higher risk of serious offending. For older males, drug use continued to be the key factor, while heavy drinking was also influential. Leaving school without any qualifications was the second most important predictor of criminal behaviour for the 18 to 30-year-old age group. The survey questioned nearly 5,000 young people in England and Wales. Almost a fifth of the group admitted committing one or more offences in the past 12 months. Nearly half of the 12 to 30-year-olds questioned had committed at least one criminal offence. The most \"prolific\" 10% of juvenile offenders were responsible for nearly half the crimes admitted by the group - they represented 1% of the full sample. Those aged 14 to 21 were the most likely to be offenders. The survey shows the average age when juvenile lawbreaking begins is 13 and a half for boys, and 14 for girls. At 12 or 13, a similar number of boys and girls offended, as well as used drugs and drank regularly, but after 14, male offenders started to outstrip women. The study also found marked differences in the nature of crime committed by the different genders at different ages. Girls under 16 were most likely to be involved in criminal damage, shoplifting, buying stolen goods and fighting, while over 16 they turned away from criminal damage to fraud and buying stolen goods. The highest levels of offending were among 18 to 21-year-old men, with fraud and workplace theft beginning at this age. The survey showed an increase in offending among 14 to 17-year-old boys since 1992/93 when the last such study was carried out. The report's authors attributed the rise mainly to increases in fighting and criminal damage. Home Office minister Charles Clarke said yesterday: \"Cutting juvenile crime, creating safer communities and restoring confidence in the youth justice system are at the top of the government's agenda.\"",

As she never came out from behind her desk, reports of her dungarees remain unconfirmed but she was definitely wearing a spotty headscarf. It made her look like a particularly cheerful refugee. Which, perhaps, she is. On the run from Sylvia Young. </p> <p>While not all doctors' surgeries are austere and Victorian (\"Please Doctor! Not the leeches!\"), Riverside looked like a nursery. And Mrs Harriman at that low table didn't help either. They should have had her doing potato prints and been done with it. </p> <p>Anyway, there was a story to Doctors (\"100 episodes\", the Radio Times squealed excitedly), but not much of one. Mac - who, sadly, is nothing like his namesake from Knots Landing - had accidentally promised to make both Dr Caroline and Dr Steve partners in the practice, but only one of them could actually be promoted. It turned out to be Dr Steve so Dr Caroline threw a plastic bedpan thing at her door and took to polishing her cheekbones. Dr Steve, whose main character trait is his height, was very pleased with himself until he had to go to a \"partners' meeting\" and not out with Dr Caroline and Dr Rana, the surgery's person of ethnic minority and dubious sexuality. (Often in drama, as in life, overly cheerful men are homosexual.) Edge of your seat stuff, I'm sure you'll agree. </p> <p>There was one patient, however. Bernard, an elderly gent, had a flashback to World War Two on his rideable lawnmower. Now, had this been Casualty, he would have lost control of the machine and mown down his wife in a splatterfest of blood, but as it was, he just sat there as we shared his visions of Lancaster bombers and his pal Johnny getting killed by some Jerry nightfighter. It was all too much for poor Bernard, who eventually decided to see a counsellor for post-traumatic stress disorder. That's what daytime television does to you. </p> <p>And for those of you interested, The British Lawnmower Museum in Southport (motto: Don't Let The Grass Grow Under Your Feet) houses a large collection of restored garden machinery and memorabilia, dating back to the invention of the lawnmower in the 1830s. It also boasts the largest toy lawnmower collection in the world, lawnmowers once owned by Diana Princess of Wales, Nicholas Parsons and Vanessa Feltz and a mower dating from before the time of Custer's Last Stand. Good to know that at the Battle Of Little Big Horn the grass was nice and neat. </p> <p><strong>Heartbreak Homes </strong> (BBC1) were just that. A bizarre programme, it followed the sad stories of people who had bought houses on the coast only to see their gardens, then their houses - and probably their lawnmowers - slip into the sea because of coastal erosion. While it was easy to feel sorry for the likes of George and Jean, a pair of retired bus drivers whose little bungalow was swallowed by the North Sea, it was more difficult to empathise with Terry and Janet who, in a stroke of staggering genius, built a house on really boggy ground. To their great surprise, it sank, though not before \"tell-tale signs\" - which is to say, cracks - appeared on the walls. The cracks were so huge, they were more tell-epic signs and a lesson not to build your house on marshland.

Up to the third week of September the local swallows were gathering on the telephone wires, with young ones still being fed by parents, obviously preparing for their own departure. By the end of the month the nest sites had been deserted and the birds had gone, following the swifts, with the dangerous journey over the Sahara ahead of them. </p> <p>As I write these notes, in the first week of October, the house martin colony on the village hall is still a scene of frantic activity, so they are going to be later than usual leaving this year. Yesterday I counted 25 birds swooping down under the eaves still feeding young in 6 nests, and while in most of them faces were peering out of the entrance holes, voices continually calling to parents, in at least two the adult birds would disappear into the nest to pass on food. This would seem to indicate that there were still some very young chicks in the colony that will need plenty of attention before they are able to join the migration. </p> <p>As the swifts, swallows and house martins disappear until spring next year, they are leaving behind them a well-stocked larder for the next influx of visitors - the winter thrushes - because the hawthorns around the village are loaded with berries, and any day now I expect the new arrivals to appear. They will have had to contend with some atrocious weather on the trip from eastern Europe, and won't find things much better here, so the least they deserve is a good food supply when they arrive.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Cheshire By the end of August the swifts in our village, who had been with us since early May, had started the long journey south to their wintering grounds in Africa, and the autumn migration of our summer visitors was well under way. Up to the third week of September the local swallows were gathering on the telephone wires, with young ones still being fed by parents, obviously preparing for their own departure. By the end of the month the nest sites had been deserted and the birds had gone, following the swifts, with the dangerous journey over the Sahara ahead of them. As I write these notes, in the first week of October, the house martin colony on the village hall is still a scene of frantic activity, so they are going to be later than usual leaving this year. Yesterday I counted 25 birds swooping down under the eaves still feeding young in 6 nests, and while in most of them faces were peering out of the entrance holes, voices continually calling to parents, in at least two the adult birds would disappear into the nest to pass on food. This would seem to indicate that there were still some very young chicks in the colony that will need plenty of attention before they are able to join the migration. As the swifts, swallows and house martins disappear until spring next year, they are leaving behind them a well-stocked larder for the next influx of visitors - the winter thrushes - because the hawthorns around the village are loaded with berries, and any day now I expect the new arrivals to appear. They will have had to contend with some atrocious weather on the trip from eastern Europe, and won't find things much better here, so the least they deserve is a good food supply when they arrive.",

The brothers - Gopichand, Srichand, and Prakesh - were accused of accepting $10m (\u00a37.1m) in commission from a Swedish arms manufacturer, Bofors, in return for using their considerable influence with the late Indian prime minister, Rajiv Gandhi, to secure an arms contract. The bribes were allegedly paid into secret Swiss bank accounts. The Hindujas, who entertained prime minister Tony Blair and his wife, Cherie, at their annual party last year, and helped bail out the failing Millennium Dome in Greenwich, south-east London, were first named in connection with the Bofors saga more than a decade ago. But in December last year after a long battle, a federal court in Switzerland ruled that crucial bank documents relat ing to the scandal could be divulged to India's central bureau of investigation (CBI). The CBI formally charged the Hindujas in Delhi yesterday. Speaking outside court, the bureau's special prosecutor, N Natrajan, claimed that the Hindujas had engaged in a criminal conspiracy. He added: \"They took commission and paid it into their accounts. They had three or four accounts, in which they hid the money,\" he said. Asked whether the case against them was strong, he added: \"Without evidence the CBI would not press charges.\" Mr Natrajan last night said that he would ask Britain to consider extraditing the billionaire industrialists once the charges had been approved by the judge hearing the case, Ajit Bharihoke. \"Since we have an extradition treaty with Britain, once they are included ... all this will follow,\" he said.

He granted the family's patriarch, Srichand P Hinduja, a British passport as recently as April 1999. The third accused, Prakesh Hinduja, lives in Geneva. The British based brothers preside over a \u00a31.3bn oil and banking empire and are Britain's eighth wealthiest individuals. Like his predecessor but one, Margaret Thatcher, Mr Blair attended the Hinduja's inter-faith dinner last November. However the then Indian high commissioner in London, Lalit Mansingh, who is now his country's foreign minister, was instructed to stay away from the festivities. The brothers also gave \u00a36m to sponsor the spirit zone at the dome following talks with Peter Mandelson. Since the saga burst into the public domain in the late eighties, the Hindujas have refused to cooperate with prosecutors investigating the Bofors deal, which saw the Swedish firm back in 1986 triumph in its battle with a rival French company to supply 400 howitzer 155mm field guns to the Indian army. Two weeks ago - in the face of documentation - they ad mitted a business association with AB Bofors. But they said that the $10m had nothing to do with the howitzer contract. Detectives investigating the Hindujas' financial affairs travelled to Geneva in June to request more documents. Last October Rajiv Gandhi was posthumously charged in connection with the scandal, with several key members of his inner circle. They include an Italian businessman, Ottavio Quattrocchi, Bofors agent Win Chadha, and India's then defence secretary, S K Bhatnagar.",

The rewards: No government car, no lavish expense account, no expensive accommodation and no perks. A one-day fee of \u00a3500 for each day's work. Workload unlikely to be more than a couple of days a week. The government is formulating its first advertisement to find the cleanest person in the United Kingdom to replace Lord Neill, the chairman of the committee on standards in public life. The post previously filled by a law lord, Lord Nolan, and a leading QC, Lord Neill, is to be thrown open as part of a Whitehall drive to open top jobs to competition. The decision to advertise the post - originally in the gift of the prime minister of the day - comes after advice from Dame Rennie Fritchie, commissioner for public appointments. She recommended that advisory appointments - especially those independent of government - be advertised. As well as the chairman, the committee intend to advertise vacancies for two other members who are due to retire. Whitehall was still working yesterday on the text of new advertisement to appear in the national press later this month - they also have to set up an appointments board equally full of the cleanest \" great and good\" to judge the character and probity of the applicants. The committee, whose members except for MPs and people holding public jobs get \u00a3180 a day, was originally set up by John Major after the cash for questions scandal involving ex Tory minister Neil Hamilton and Harrods owner, Mohamed Al Fayed. The first appointee, Lord Nolan, created the tough rules aimed at preventing sleaze in parliament and forcing MPs to declare incomes and contracts from parliamentary consultancies. His successor, Lord Neill, immediately ran into controversy when he advised Tony Blair to hand back the \u00a31m donation from Formula One promoter Bernie Ecclestone after his business received an exemption from a ban on cigarette advertising and sponsorship. Lord Neill himself became embroiled in a row over \"conflict of interest\" when it emerged he had been advising Dame Shirley Porter, the controversial Westminster council leader, on her appeal against a \u00a331 million surcharge over the \" homes for votes \" scandal.

      "bodyText": "Some of Britain's finest legal minds were asked to ponder the status of motorised scooters yesterday thanks to a bizarre police chase likened to the Keystone Cops. Sitting at the high court in London, Lord Justice Pill, with Mr Justice Bell, suggested the public may need more protection from the Go-Ped craze because a loophole in the law had allowed their uncontrolled use. The case followed a chase through Harrogate, North Yorkshire, which ended in the arrest of 38-year-old restaurateur, Michael Saddington, on charges of driving while disqualified. As he tried out a Go-Ped belonging to one of his staff - similar in style to the popular folding aluminium scooters, but larger and fitted with a small petrol engine - Mr Saddington heard police sirens. \"It was a bit like the Keystone Cops actually. When the siren was going I thought: 'I wonder where they are going,' expecting them to whoosh straight past. But it turned out they were chasing me,\" he said outside the court. Yesterday's test case was brought by the chief constable of North Yorkshire against a Harrogate magistrates court decision last February that Go-Peds were not motor vehicles. The magistrates had cleared Mr Saddington, from Middlesbrough, of driving a motor vehicle while disqualified and driving without insurance. The judges said the court would need time to consider whether Go-Peds, which are capable of speeds up to 20mph, could be classified as motor vehicles as a possible answer to the difficulties they posed. Geraldine Kelly, appearing for the police, said the status of the scooters, which are powered by a 22.5cc two-stroke direct drive engine, was causing confusion and guidance was being sought from the court. She urged the judges to rule that they should be classified as motor vehicles so their use could be controlled in the interests of public safety. Richard Reed, appearing for Mr Saddington, said: \"This is not a motor vehicle and a clear message needs to be sent out that these are not to be used on the road - a message clearly spelt out by the manufacturer and retailer.\" After the hearing, Mr Saddington, described how he had borrowed a Go-Ped. He said he was spotted by police after he failed to stop at traffic lights. He was chased by a police car until he picked up his machine and went into a pub, where he was questioned and officers discovered he was disqualified from driving. When he appeared before magistrates, he pleaded guilty to failing to stop at the lights and failing to stop for the police. He was found guilty of failing to wear protective headgear, but was cleared of driving a motor vehicle while disqualified and with no insurance. He was fined \u00a3275, including costs. In court, Ms Kelly argued that both a driving licence and insurance should be required for Go-Ped drivers as they could properly be classified as motor vehicles under the provisions of the 1988 Road Traffic Act. Lord Justice Pill said: \"This all shows the dangers of putting a Go-Ped on a public road. That is the very kind of machine which the public needs protection against.\" The case continues.",

In the letter to race tracks, Carlton chief executive Gerry Murphy has also sketched out plans for an additional free racing channel. \"There is no doubt that racing is a hugely valuable asset,\" said one insider close to Carlton. \"Interactivity is where racing really comes into its own because people want to look at form and the going and, of course, to bet online.\"",

      "bodyText": "South Africa's health minister, Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, has admitted that while her government refuses to prescribe anti-Aids drugs to people infected with HIV, members of parliament receive the treatments at public expense. The opposition has accused President Thabo Mbeki of gross hypocrisy because the government has told doctors that it it is illegal to provide anti-retroviral drugs to rape victims and pregnant women as a preventative measure, but the parliamentary health scheme specifically offers treatment in both cases. Last week, the health authorities ordered one charity to stop providing AZT and other drugs to rape victims on the grounds that they have not been approved for such use. The revelations will add to the surge of criticism Mr Mbeki has brought on himself by his Aids policies and his controversial questioning of the bulk of scientific opinion that HIV causes the disease. The president has been attacked by South Africa's medical establishment, the trade union movement and the Anglican church, which recently called his Aids policy a crime against humanity comparable to apartheid. The parliamentary medical scheme - which serves 2,000 MPs and judges - includes an option called the \"aid for Aids\" plan, which provides anti-HIV drugs up to the value of \u00a34,000 for, among others, rape victims and pregnant women. The hope is to prevent mother to child transmission. So far, 68 MPs have signed up for the option. The South African government has repeatedly justified its refusal to provide similar treatment in public hospitals, on the grounds that there is no evidence that the drug works in those cases, and because of the cost. Although AZT and other anti-Aids drugs are registered in South Africa, they have not been officially approved for use in preventing the transmission of HIV after a rape or by pregnant women. Mr Mbeki has previously written to the leader of the official opposition, Tony Leon, accusing him of \"blatant defiance of the law\" for advocating that doctors prescribe anti-retroviral drugs in such cases. The president said that if this were to happen, the government would have to \"take the necessary action to stop what would have been illegal behaviour\". Mr Leon said in a statement that while Mr Mbeki \"plays with the lives of South Africans\" by casting doubt on the causes of Aids, he and his fellow members of government enjoy \"Rolls-Royce\" Aids treatments. \"This government is clearly willing to take action on Aids only when the crisis has direct implications for its own members,\" Mr Leon said. \"The needs of the rest of the country are averted with appeals to mythical African solutions, while members of government enjoy the best treatments the world has to offer.\" Mrs Tshabalala-Msimang has defended the apparent discrepancy in policy by saying that the parliamentary health scheme is a matter for the private sector. \"MPs are members of the medical aid scheme, no different from people who belong to other medical aid schemes,\" she said. \"AZT is available out there in the private sector.

      "body": "<p>The value of people's money was fluctuating wildly, the mobile phone network was in meltdown, and money dealers stood confused: Yugoslavia's revolution has hit the currency black market.</p> <p>Reports flew across the country that the currency, the dinar, was exchanging for the deutschmark at hugely different rates. \"Democratic change in Belgrade makes mess on the street currency market,\" read Vecerni Novosti's headline yesterday.</p> <p>In the central Serbian city of Cacak, the dinar fell from 43 to the mark to 25 and yet prices remained the same. In nearby Kraljevo, it later rose from 25 to 32. Money dealers stopped working and peasants and black market traders stopped selling because they couldn't price their goods.</p> <p>\"On Saturday, we were selling 38 dinars to the mark. On Sunday the rate was 22. Now we are selling at 25 and buying at 30,\" said one money dealer, Zoran Mitrovic. \"But everybody likes it and is cheering about what's happening.</p> <p>\"A stable situation is more important to them than prices,\" he said, adding that the disparity in buy and sell rates would narrow.</p> <p>Dr Milan Kovacevic, founder of the G17 independent economic thinktank, which is close to the new president, Vojislav Kostunica, explained why the dinar is gaining strength: \"Representatives from G17 met Yugoslav National Bank governor Dusan Vlatkovic on Saturday and he promised he would not sell foreign currency, and that he would stop printing dinars.\"</p> <p>Dr Kovacevic also explained that, psychologically, the mood across Serbia has changed.

      "bodyText": "The value of people's money was fluctuating wildly, the mobile phone network was in meltdown, and money dealers stood confused: Yugoslavia's revolution has hit the currency black market. Reports flew across the country that the currency, the dinar, was exchanging for the deutschmark at hugely different rates. \"Democratic change in Belgrade makes mess on the street currency market,\" read Vecerni Novosti's headline yesterday. In the central Serbian city of Cacak, the dinar fell from 43 to the mark to 25 and yet prices remained the same. In nearby Kraljevo, it later rose from 25 to 32. Money dealers stopped working and peasants and black market traders stopped selling because they couldn't price their goods. \"On Saturday, we were selling 38 dinars to the mark. On Sunday the rate was 22. Now we are selling at 25 and buying at 30,\" said one money dealer, Zoran Mitrovic. \"But everybody likes it and is cheering about what's happening. \"A stable situation is more important to them than prices,\" he said, adding that the disparity in buy and sell rates would narrow. Dr Milan Kovacevic, founder of the G17 independent economic thinktank, which is close to the new president, Vojislav Kostunica, explained why the dinar is gaining strength: \"Representatives from G17 met Yugoslav National Bank governor Dusan Vlatkovic on Saturday and he promised he would not sell foreign currency, and that he would stop printing dinars.\" Dr Kovacevic also explained that, psychologically, the mood across Serbia has changed. People are now counting on an influx of foreign capital, so they are not selling dinars. Mr Kostunica has improved the trade environment within the federation by lifting trade barriers between Serbia and Montenegro. The Yugoslav National Bank holds $285m (\u00a3197m) in hard currency. But, faced with economic difficulties, Slobodan Milosevic's regime resorted to printing money to repay debts. The national bank has been massively increasing the money supply over the past year - reducing the dinar's value. Prices subsequently rose to keep apace. Now both dealer and economist expect the rate to steady. \"I think the rate will stabilise - and probably go down,\" said Dr Kovacevic.",

      "body": "<p>The Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, was yesterday close to the centre of world events, much as he has been on and off for the last 30 years. He was engaged in a flurry of discussions about the Middle East violence, meeting in the morning with the Egyptian prime minister, Hosni Mubarak, and last night with the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan. Today, he will see the Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov.</p> <p>The question being asked in Tel Aviv, Washington and among Palestinians was whether he still had any control over events. He appears to have no power to prevent the demonstrations that have cost the lives of more than 80 Palestinians.</p> <p>Ominously, without his authority, Fatah, the organisation he is supposed to lead, issued a leaflet at the weekend calling for a popular war against Israel. A new generation of Palestinian leaders is being bloodied in the confrontations with Israeli troops, one with a very different perspective on the world from Mr Arafat, one that wants to take the battle to Israel.</p> <p>If Mr Arafat cannot control his people there is no longer any reason for either the US or the Israeli government to talk to him.</p> <p>He is 71, looks ill, and is leading a Palestinian authority that has been scarred by corruption and cronyism and discredited, above all, by failure in Palestinian eyes to deliver an acceptable peace agreement.</p> <p>But Said Aburish, biographer of Mr Arafat, said yesterday it was too soon to dismiss the leader: \"Arafat has always bent when he is under a great deal of pressure. I think that is what is happening now. He is somewhat losing control, though it might be more accurate to say he is not in control rather than losing control. The Palestinian security apparatus has almost taken a neutral position.\"</p> <p>But he regarded the Fatah leaflet, if it was issued without Mr Arafat's authority, as a serious development.</p> <p>He described the demonstrations as a victory for the Palestinians, in spite of the death toll: \"They have been able to take that kind of punishment. The issue is whether the Israelis can take it.\"</p> <p>The violence, though almost certainly not instigated by Mr Arafat, is perversely useful to him. It allows him to say to the Israeli government: look what happens when you refuse to make the extra compromises needed to secure a peace deal.</p> <p>The head of the Palestinian delegation to Britain, Afif Safieh, was adamant the demonstrations were not being deviously organised behind the scenes by Mr Arafat: \"Most of the demonstrations have been of a spontaneous nature and reflect the frustration of the population of 33 years of occupation and nine years of a peace process that has resulted only in an apartheid system.\"</p> <p>The Fatah leaflet warned that the uprising, the intifada, will last a long time. In one sign of escalation, a Fatah official said that its youth wing had opened fire on Israeli soldiers for the first time with M-16 rifles and Kalashnikovs.</p> <p>If Fatah was united Mr Arafat might be in trouble, but it is not. One Fatah official, who is a cabinet minister in the Palestinian authority, said; \"It is not the intifada of 1987. We have a new situation now because the leadership is not in exile. It controls the West Bank and Gaza.\"</p> <p>Mahdi Abdul-Hadi, director of the Jerusalem-based Palestinian Society for the Study of International Affairs, cautioned against reading too much into the Fatah leaflet.</p> <p>He said that people had learned during the intifada of the 1980s and 1990s, when Mr Arafat had been absent, to make their own decisions.</p> <p>In Gaza, Mr Arafat had control but on the West Bank villages were run independently. \"In the end, we are all part of the same tribe and he [Arafat] was head of the tribe,\" Mr Abdul-Hadi said, playing down the internal divisions.</p> <p>The Israeli government discussed over the last week whether Mr Arafat's continuance as leader was a help or a hindrance.

      "bodyText": "The Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, was yesterday close to the centre of world events, much as he has been on and off for the last 30 years. He was engaged in a flurry of discussions about the Middle East violence, meeting in the morning with the Egyptian prime minister, Hosni Mubarak, and last night with the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan. Today, he will see the Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov. The question being asked in Tel Aviv, Washington and among Palestinians was whether he still had any control over events. He appears to have no power to prevent the demonstrations that have cost the lives of more than 80 Palestinians. Ominously, without his authority, Fatah, the organisation he is supposed to lead, issued a leaflet at the weekend calling for a popular war against Israel. A new generation of Palestinian leaders is being bloodied in the confrontations with Israeli troops, one with a very different perspective on the world from Mr Arafat, one that wants to take the battle to Israel. If Mr Arafat cannot control his people there is no longer any reason for either the US or the Israeli government to talk to him. He is 71, looks ill, and is leading a Palestinian authority that has been scarred by corruption and cronyism and discredited, above all, by failure in Palestinian eyes to deliver an acceptable peace agreement. But Said Aburish, biographer of Mr Arafat, said yesterday it was too soon to dismiss the leader: \"Arafat has always bent when he is under a great deal of pressure. I think that is what is happening now. He is somewhat losing control, though it might be more accurate to say he is not in control rather than losing control. The Palestinian security apparatus has almost taken a neutral position.\" But he regarded the Fatah leaflet, if it was issued without Mr Arafat's authority, as a serious development. He described the demonstrations as a victory for the Palestinians, in spite of the death toll: \"They have been able to take that kind of punishment. The issue is whether the Israelis can take it.\" The violence, though almost certainly not instigated by Mr Arafat, is perversely useful to him. It allows him to say to the Israeli government: look what happens when you refuse to make the extra compromises needed to secure a peace deal. The head of the Palestinian delegation to Britain, Afif Safieh, was adamant the demonstrations were not being deviously organised behind the scenes by Mr Arafat: \"Most of the demonstrations have been of a spontaneous nature and reflect the frustration of the population of 33 years of occupation and nine years of a peace process that has resulted only in an apartheid system.\" The Fatah leaflet warned that the uprising, the intifada, will last a long time. In one sign of escalation, a Fatah official said that its youth wing had opened fire on Israeli soldiers for the first time with M-16 rifles and Kalashnikovs. If Fatah was united Mr Arafat might be in trouble, but it is not. One Fatah official, who is a cabinet minister in the Palestinian authority, said; \"It is not the intifada of 1987. We have a new situation now because the leadership is not in exile. It controls the West Bank and Gaza.\" Mahdi Abdul-Hadi, director of the Jerusalem-based Palestinian Society for the Study of International Affairs, cautioned against reading too much into the Fatah leaflet. He said that people had learned during the intifada of the 1980s and 1990s, when Mr Arafat had been absent, to make their own decisions. In Gaza, Mr Arafat had control but on the West Bank villages were run independently. \"In the end, we are all part of the same tribe and he [Arafat] was head of the tribe,\" Mr Abdul-Hadi said, playing down the internal divisions. The Israeli government discussed over the last week whether Mr Arafat's continuance as leader was a help or a hindrance. The US will have made the same calculation. Both will have concluded that it will be better to have him in place as they know him. There will be a new leadership in the US and probably in Israel within months. But when the process begins again, the likelihood is that Mr Arafat will still be there.",

Its share of the vote in Antwerp rose to 33%, from 28% in 1994, the last time that local elections were held in Belgium. The Blok's success is part of an alarming trend which has seen J\u00f6rg Haider's far-right Freedom party make dramatic electoral gains in Austria, and it mirrors that of Scandinavian anti-foreigner parties which have also recently seen their popularity on the rise.

It was there in the late 60s that he met Ric Ocasek, a musician and college dropout. Orr was working as a session musician and producer at a local studio. Previously, he fronted the house band of the TV rock show Upbeat, and was leader of a local group, The Grasshoppers. That group split when some members were drafted to Vietnam, though not before Orr had earned a reputation as a versatile musician who could sing or play drums, bass and guitar.</p> <p>Orr and the gangling Ocasek began collaborating in an assortment of bands. In 1972, they were part of the folk trio Milkwood, and released an album on Paramount featuring future Cars keyboardist Greg Hawkes. But it wasn't until 1976 that Orr and Ocasek formed The Cars, bringing in ex-Modern Lovers drummer David Robinson and Hawkes. The lineup was completed by guitarist Elliot Easton, who had also played with Orr and Ocasek in the Boston-based Cap'n Swing.</p> <p>As The Cars took shape, the first rumblings of punk were being heard around Boston. Local punkistas gravitated to the city's Rat Club, where early performances by The Cars demonstrated that they were miles ahead of the competition in terms of professionalism and musicality. Elektra waved a chequebook at them in 1978, and promptly sent them into the studio with producer Roy Thomas. Their eponymous debut album was recorded in a fortnight and released that same year.</p> <p>While superficially conforming to what Americans like to call \"New Wave\", complete with a sheen of technological hauteur and an aura of pop-art cool, the album bristled with catchy pop songs, mostly by Ocasek. An early demo of Just What I Needed had already been a favourite on Boston radio station WBCN, and now became the group's debut Top 30 hit. It was followed into the Top 50 by Good Times Roll and My Best Friend's Girl.</p> <p>In 1979, Rolling Stone readers voted The Cars best new band, while their million-selling debut album was such a strong performer that its follow-up, Candy-O, was delayed for several months, then promptly sold 1m copies in eight weeks. The band drew a crowd of 500,000 to New York's Central Park, and their third album, 1980's Panorama, was another platinum-seller.</p> <p>In 1982, Orr began working on his own album, though it wouldn't emerge for four years. Meanwhile, The Cars bought Intermedia Studios in Boston, which they rechristened Syncro Sound. It was here that they recorded parts of their fourth million-seller, 1982's Shake It Up.</p> <p>Heartbeat City, released in 1984, spawned another batch of hit singles including Drive. Following its Live Aid exposure, the record was re-promoted and went into the charts for the second time. The group donated their royalties to the Band Aid Trust.</p> <p>The Cars had begun to lose momentum, though Orr showed he could function successfully on his own with his album The Lace (1986). This gave him a Top 40 hit with Stay The Night. In 1987, Door To Door became The Cars' last, and least, album, with Ocasek now committed to a solo career and the others happy to follow suit. Orr took a lengthy sabbatical from the rock business. In 1994, while the other Cars reunited for rehearsals, Orr debuted his new band - called simply Orr. Subsequently he moved from Vermont to Atlanta, and joined a band of rock veterans called Big People.</p> <p>His marriage ended in divorce: he leaves a son.</p> <p>\u0095 Benjamin Orr (Orzechowski), musician, born August 9 1947; died October 3 2000</p>",

Local punkistas gravitated to the city's Rat Club, where early performances by The Cars demonstrated that they were miles ahead of the competition in terms of professionalism and musicality. Elektra waved a chequebook at them in 1978, and promptly sent them into the studio with producer Roy Thomas. Their eponymous debut album was recorded in a fortnight and released that same year. While superficially conforming to what Americans like to call \"New Wave\", complete with a sheen of technological hauteur and an aura of pop-art cool, the album bristled with catchy pop songs, mostly by Ocasek. An early demo of Just What I Needed had already been a favourite on Boston radio station WBCN, and now became the group's debut Top 30 hit. It was followed into the Top 50 by Good Times Roll and My Best Friend's Girl. In 1979, Rolling Stone readers voted The Cars best new band, while their million-selling debut album was such a strong performer that its follow-up, Candy-O, was delayed for several months, then promptly sold 1m copies in eight weeks. The band drew a crowd of 500,000 to New York's Central Park, and their third album, 1980's Panorama, was another platinum-seller. In 1982, Orr began working on his own album, though it wouldn't emerge for four years. Meanwhile, The Cars bought Intermedia Studios in Boston, which they rechristened Syncro Sound. It was here that they recorded parts of their fourth million-seller, 1982's Shake It Up. Heartbeat City, released in 1984, spawned another batch of hit singles including Drive. Following its Live Aid exposure, the record was re-promoted and went into the charts for the second time. The group donated their royalties to the Band Aid Trust. The Cars had begun to lose momentum, though Orr showed he could function successfully on his own with his album The Lace (1986). This gave him a Top 40 hit with Stay The Night. In 1987, Door To Door became The Cars' last, and least, album, with Ocasek now committed to a solo career and the others happy to follow suit. Orr took a lengthy sabbatical from the rock business. In 1994, while the other Cars reunited for rehearsals, Orr debuted his new band - called simply Orr. Subsequently he moved from Vermont to Atlanta, and joined a band of rock veterans called Big People. His marriage ended in divorce: he leaves a son. \u0095 Benjamin Orr (Orzechowski), musician, born August 9 1947; died October 3 2000",

At 11, he won a scholarship to the independent Arnold School, where he was inspired by a chemistry teacher called Sidney Law. Law also encouraged his pupils to broaden their horizons. Smith recalled that he was persuaded to read a better newspaper than the one to which his parents subscribed: he became a life-long reader of what was then the Manchester Guardian. His faith in Law grew when he became a reader of the New Yorker, another life-long addiction, almost from the moment he arrived in North America as part of the brain drain.</p> <p>Smith went to Manchester University in 1950 to study chemistry. In 1956, he got a PhD. In his final year, he and his classmates were applying for research jobs in America, and in the summer of 1956 he heard of a brilliant young scientist at the British Columbia Research Council, in Vancouver, Gobind Khorana, who had a place for a research assistant. The job was to develop ways of synthesising molecules that belonged to the biologically important organo-phosphate groups.</p> <p>He got the job. The chemistry was far more difficult than the research into the classes of compounds on which he had been trained for his PhD; but it led him to carry out research on substances whose existence and biological significance had only recently been discovered.

It gave him a chance to learn about marine biology and continue work in nucleic acid chemistry, and to develop a new method for synthesising complex phosphates.</p> <p>Smith became a medical research associate of the Medical Research Council of Canada in 1966 with a salary that let him join the faculty at the University of British Columbia, where his Nobel prizewinning work was done. In 1986 he created a new interdisciplinary institute, the Biotechnology Laboratory, which remained his academic home, punctuated by sabbaticals at Rockefeller University, New York; the Laboratory of Molecular Biology of the Medical Research Council, in Cambridge; and Yale University.</p> <p>Smith had not set out to solve the particular question that his discovery so importantly answered. It was one scientists had been toying with since the discovery that the flow of genetic information went from genes contained in DNA via the translator molecule RNA as coded instructions to the protein-manufacturing part of cells in the body. Many wondered if re-programming the code of a DNA molecule was possible - to manipulate the production of protein molecules.</p> <p>Smith's oligonucleotide-based site-directed mutagenesis turned it into a reality. It emerged from work in the 1970s in which he learned how to synthesise oligonucleotides - short, single-strand DNA fragments. He also studied how these synthetic fragments could bind a virus to DNA. To his surprise, he discovered that even if one of the small molecules of the synthetic DNA fragment was incorrect, it could still bind at the correct position in the virus DNA and be used when new DNA was being synthesised.</p> <p>The story goes that while at Cambridge, during a coffee-break discussion, the idea arose of getting a reprogrammed synthetic oligonucleotide to bind to a DNA molecule and then having it replicate in a suitable host organism. This would give a mutation, which, in turn, would be able to produce a modified protein.</p> <p>In 1978 Smith and his co-workers made this idea work. They succeeded both in inducing a mutation in a virus, and in \"curing\" a natural mutant of this virus so that it regained its natural properties.

It is now preserved as a crucial historical document in America's National Archives, alongside the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. But the man who penned it, Frank Wills, has died in deepest poverty at the age of 52.</p> <p>It was he who precipitated the 1972 Watergate crisis and America's first presidential resignation. His involvement brought him brief fame, including a small part in the film All The President's Men, but eventually left him bitter and disillusioned. \"I was treated like a criminal myself,\" he commented a few years ago. \"I got nothing for what I did and I completely lost my faith in the political system.\"</p> <p>As a teenager, Wills had moved from his native South Carolina to work at the Chrysler factory in Detroit, but Chrysler made him redundant during the 1968 recession. At the suggestion of fellow workers, Wills decamped to Washington, but as a 21-year-old black he found it hard to scrape a living when dozens of major cities, including the capital, were erupting in race riots which petrified white employers. Yet by the summer of 1972, he had secured a steady job as a security guard at the Watergate office complex, though only at the statutory minimum wage.</p> <p>On Saturday June 17, he came on duty at midnight and carried out his first check of the offices, starting in the basement and working methodically up to the 11th floor. It was tedious work, trying the handle of each office door to confirm it was properly secured. It was also a sticky night and, when he had finished his first round, Wills went for an orange juice at the Howard Johnson motel across the road.</p> <p>As he was leaving by the Watergate basement door he found its catch taped back. He stripped off the grey gaffer tape, explaining later that, \"A lot of times we'd have engineers doing work late at night. They'd place something in the door because they'd be coming right back so I really didn't pay much attention to it.\"</p> <p>However, before he returned to the security office after his break, he decided to double-check the door. Finding the catch retaped in exactly the same way, he made his historic phone call.</p> <p>On the sixth floor of the building, the police discovered James McCord and four companions hiding inside the offices of the Democratic National Committee, in the throes of what President Nixon's spokesman initially dismissed as \"a third-rate burglary\". As the political storm developed, Wills tried to use his unexpected fame to win a rise for himself and better working conditions for his fellow security men.</p> <p>The bargaining power of one young black has never been high in the US, and Wills soon found himself out of work. Though he received an award from the Democratic National Committee for his \"unique role in the history of the nation\", it brought him no practical benefit. Not the least of his problems was his capacity to antagonise successive employers by absenting himself to give media interviews.</p> <p>However, he firmly believed that his difficulty in finding work came from being \"blacklisted\". He alleged that one Washington university had refused to hire him lest it lose federal funds (though Georgetown University did later recruit him to its security staff).</p> <p>As he faded from the public scene, Wills's problems multiplied. He drifted constantly between Washington and his mother's home in North Augusta, South Carolina, finding a succession of short-lived and low-paid jobs. In 1983, he was convicted of shoplifting in Georgia, though he always maintained his innocence. The one beneficial outcome of the case was that it led the comedian Dick Gregory to hire Wills to promote a health supplement, a role which took him to live in the Bahamas.</p> <p>In 1990, however, he had to return to South Carolina to care for his mother, by then seriously ill after a stroke. Both had to subsist on the \u00a375 a week she received in social security payments. When she died in 1992, Wills was unable to meet the funeral costs, and had to donate her body for medical research.</p> <p>From then on he got by doing odd jobs for neighbours and caring for his aunt, also a stroke victim. Earlier this year he was found to have an inoperable brain tumour. His daughter Angel survives him.</p> <p>\u0095 Frank Wills, security guard, born 1948; died September 27 2000</p>",

At the suggestion of fellow workers, Wills decamped to Washington, but as a 21-year-old black he found it hard to scrape a living when dozens of major cities, including the capital, were erupting in race riots which petrified white employers. Yet by the summer of 1972, he had secured a steady job as a security guard at the Watergate office complex, though only at the statutory minimum wage. On Saturday June 17, he came on duty at midnight and carried out his first check of the offices, starting in the basement and working methodically up to the 11th floor. It was tedious work, trying the handle of each office door to confirm it was properly secured. It was also a sticky night and, when he had finished his first round, Wills went for an orange juice at the Howard Johnson motel across the road. As he was leaving by the Watergate basement door he found its catch taped back. He stripped off the grey gaffer tape, explaining later that, \"A lot of times we'd have engineers doing work late at night. They'd place something in the door because they'd be coming right back so I really didn't pay much attention to it.\" However, before he returned to the security office after his break, he decided to double-check the door. Finding the catch retaped in exactly the same way, he made his historic phone call. On the sixth floor of the building, the police discovered James McCord and four companions hiding inside the offices of the Democratic National Committee, in the throes of what President Nixon's spokesman initially dismissed as \"a third-rate burglary\". As the political storm developed, Wills tried to use his unexpected fame to win a rise for himself and better working conditions for his fellow security men. The bargaining power of one young black has never been high in the US, and Wills soon found himself out of work. Though he received an award from the Democratic National Committee for his \"unique role in the history of the nation\", it brought him no practical benefit. Not the least of his problems was his capacity to antagonise successive employers by absenting himself to give media interviews. However, he firmly believed that his difficulty in finding work came from being \"blacklisted\". He alleged that one Washington university had refused to hire him lest it lose federal funds (though Georgetown University did later recruit him to its security staff). As he faded from the public scene, Wills's problems multiplied. He drifted constantly between Washington and his mother's home in North Augusta, South Carolina, finding a succession of short-lived and low-paid jobs. In 1983, he was convicted of shoplifting in Georgia, though he always maintained his innocence. The one beneficial outcome of the case was that it led the comedian Dick Gregory to hire Wills to promote a health supplement, a role which took him to live in the Bahamas. In 1990, however, he had to return to South Carolina to care for his mother, by then seriously ill after a stroke. Both had to subsist on the \u00a375 a week she received in social security payments. When she died in 1992, Wills was unable to meet the funeral costs, and had to donate her body for medical research. From then on he got by doing odd jobs for neighbours and caring for his aunt, also a stroke victim. Earlier this year he was found to have an inoperable brain tumour. His daughter Angel survives him. \u0095 Frank Wills, security guard, born 1948; died September 27 2000",

      "body": "<p>It was last week when I could stand it no longer. I put in a call to BBC2 and hit them with the four words they fear most, \"I'm ringing about Seinfeld.\" I know, and they know (and they know I know) that they have handled their scheduling of this prince among sit-coms shamefully, kicking it around the schedules like an old tin can, so that even dedicated fans can't find it. </p> <p>BBC2 is currently showing the penultimate series of Seinfeld and, in the jargon of the business, they are \"stripping it\", showing it at the same time every evening. Late. According to a chap called Sal in the acquisitions department, \"that seems to be the best way to reach the audience for this programme. We can guarantee it will be on around the same time every night.\" Except it is not on every night. </p> <p>\"If there is a special event,\" says Sal, \"it might be dropped. Obviously the Olympics affected it.\" </p> <p>\"So why isn't it on tonight?\" I ask (this is last Thursday). </p> <p>\"Isn't it?\" asks Sal, \"Are you sure?\" </p> <p>\"Yes, according to my paper there's a repeat of a programme about a bloke whose caravan firm went bust.\" </p> <p>\"I'll have to check that\", says Sal. \"Oh, you're right. I don't know why that is. I suppose I have to say we reserve the right to change schedules.\" </p> <p>So every night, then. Except if the Olympics are on. Or snooker, or golf obviously, or a repeated documentary about the mobile homes industry. </p> <p>If this were just any American sit-com I would not mind, but Seinfeld is a programme that the BBC has misunderstood from the start. </p> <p>Because it looks and sounds like I Love Lucy or Rhoda, with its audience laughter, musical stings, and one-liners, it has always been treated as cement to fill in the cracks between BBC2's fine domestic output. </p> <p>Sure, it is a team-written gag machine - with some very fine gags: \"Why should manslaughter be the least form of homicide?\" asks George. \"It's the slaughter of a man. They should call it involuntary snuffing out, or something.\" \"Perhaps they could call it 'I can't believe it's not murder'\", replies Jerry. Another time, George is attracted by a girl's habit of covering longeurs in a narrative with the expression \"yada, yada\". \"I love her succinct way of talking,\" says George. \"Yes,\" says Jerry, \"It's like dating USA Today.\" </p> <p>But Seinfeld is so much more than the sum of its gags. </p> <p>It has been called a show about nothing, but it is only a show about nothing in the sense that Jane Austen wrote novels about nothing. Just as Austen fixed her gaze firmly on English country life in the early 19th century, and depicted the foibles of that tiny corner of society with irony, so Seinfeld remains rooted in the enclosed world of four rich single people living in the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Same obsession with manners, same ironic take on the gender divide. </p> <p>And if you think Jane Austen something of a high-flown parallel for a mere sitcom, the Los Angeles Times compared the programme to the work of Marcel Proust. Over there, of course, Seinfeld was more or less a national obsession. It finished its run more than two years ago, after 178 episodes - Jerry says there will be no more - in a blizzard of statistics.

      "bodyText": "It was last week when I could stand it no longer. I put in a call to BBC2 and hit them with the four words they fear most, \"I'm ringing about Seinfeld.\" I know, and they know (and they know I know) that they have handled their scheduling of this prince among sit-coms shamefully, kicking it around the schedules like an old tin can, so that even dedicated fans can't find it. BBC2 is currently showing the penultimate series of Seinfeld and, in the jargon of the business, they are \"stripping it\", showing it at the same time every evening. Late. According to a chap called Sal in the acquisitions department, \"that seems to be the best way to reach the audience for this programme. We can guarantee it will be on around the same time every night.\" Except it is not on every night. \"If there is a special event,\" says Sal, \"it might be dropped. Obviously the Olympics affected it.\" \"So why isn't it on tonight?\" I ask (this is last Thursday). \"Isn't it?\" asks Sal, \"Are you sure?\" \"Yes, according to my paper there's a repeat of a programme about a bloke whose caravan firm went bust.\" \"I'll have to check that\", says Sal. \"Oh, you're right. I don't know why that is. I suppose I have to say we reserve the right to change schedules.\" So every night, then. Except if the Olympics are on. Or snooker, or golf obviously, or a repeated documentary about the mobile homes industry. If this were just any American sit-com I would not mind, but Seinfeld is a programme that the BBC has misunderstood from the start. Because it looks and sounds like I Love Lucy or Rhoda, with its audience laughter, musical stings, and one-liners, it has always been treated as cement to fill in the cracks between BBC2's fine domestic output. Sure, it is a team-written gag machine - with some very fine gags: \"Why should manslaughter be the least form of homicide?\" asks George. \"It's the slaughter of a man. They should call it involuntary snuffing out, or something.\" \"Perhaps they could call it 'I can't believe it's not murder'\", replies Jerry. Another time, George is attracted by a girl's habit of covering longeurs in a narrative with the expression \"yada, yada\". \"I love her succinct way of talking,\" says George. \"Yes,\" says Jerry, \"It's like dating USA Today.\" But Seinfeld is so much more than the sum of its gags. It has been called a show about nothing, but it is only a show about nothing in the sense that Jane Austen wrote novels about nothing. Just as Austen fixed her gaze firmly on English country life in the early 19th century, and depicted the foibles of that tiny corner of society with irony, so Seinfeld remains rooted in the enclosed world of four rich single people living in the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Same obsession with manners, same ironic take on the gender divide. And if you think Jane Austen something of a high-flown parallel for a mere sitcom, the Los Angeles Times compared the programme to the work of Marcel Proust. Over there, of course, Seinfeld was more or less a national obsession. It finished its run more than two years ago, after 178 episodes - Jerry says there will be no more - in a blizzard of statistics. Forty million viewers, advertising slots going for $2m a shot, revenue of $180m per series, and so on. Some say the programme failed to cross the Atlantic successfully, because we are unable to sympathise or identify with any of the characters. And it is true that they are all awful, self-obsessed and utterly amoral. George converts to the Latvian Orthodox religion to pick up a girl. Asked by the priest what attracted him to the religion, he replies, \"The hats, I think.\" Elaine ruins a couple's chances of adopting, so she leaves a message on their answering machine offering to take them out to lunch. The darkness of it can leave you open-mouthed at times. What makes Seinfeld more audacious than something like Larry Sanders is that its commentary on the heartlessness of modern urban life is delivered in the context of a conventional-looking sitcom. There is no soft centre in Seinfeld. But I think we are sophisticated enough to handle that. No, Seinfeld has been killed in Britain by the scheduling. The vastly inferior Frasier has built up a following because people know when they can see it, and can become familiar with its tone of voice. Sky, who have primary rights, have shown Seinfeld, Paramount Comedy Channel is currently showing some episodes, but what it really needs is a regular, reliable spot on terrestrial TV. The acquisitions department know what they've got - I spent a happy time on the phone to them re-living classic moments - but what it now needs is friends in high places in the BBC, if we are not to continue missing out on television comedy's finest half-hour.

Thousands of fans queued for more than three hours to enter the museum in Yono, 16 miles north of the capital, which depicts Lennon's life as a journey from the dark of his troubled Liverpool roots to the light of happy family holidays in Japan with Ono. An impressive array of exhibits from the Beatles era are displayed in gloomy, narrow rooms that emphasise the misery of his childhood and the superficial commercialism of the band's early years. Footage of screaming fans is juxtaposed with lyrics showing how Lennon grew disillusioned with success. Lennon's first meeting with Ono is described as an epiphany that led him to a wider world beyond the band. \"As far as John was concerned, the most important thing in his life was now Yoko, not the other Beatles,\" reads one panel covering the break-up of the group. There are several displays of Yoko's art and how she brought out her husband's creativity. One panel claims that the song Imagine was taken from her anthropology of poems. Visitors move upstairs to a bright, airy gallery, where the final decade of Lennon's life with Ono is portrayed as idyllic.

      "body": "<p>Sometimes, through the chemical haze of the 60s, I wondered where Hoppy had come from. He'd pop out from behind the counter at UFO. \"Hi man!\" he'd say in his reed-like voice, eyes unnaturally sparkling behind thick-rimmed specs, a beatific smile on his gnomic face. It was like he'd been at the heart of the counterculture for ever, his name constantly mentioned in despatches as we lay on our cushions waiting for the next happening to be organised from the engine room of the underground.</p> <p>And then suddenly, on the day Sergeant Pepper was released, Hoppy was gone, busted, put inside: \"The guy who was responsible for getting me busted was Lord Young. His daughter went to Holland Park School and played truant a lot - because it was far more interesting to hang around in Ladbroke Grove where we were running a thing called the Free School. Lord Young heard about this and decided his daughter was being corrupted and it was my fault, and apparently he had a word with somebody in power and got me busted. The rest is history.\"</p> <p>The Notting Hill Free School was an idea that Hoppy had started up in a building belonging to Michael X (a sort of British Malcolm X). Anybody who had something to teach could set up class, and beats like the poet Harry Fainlight and early psycho-geographer John Michel would drop in to lecture. When I'd gone to All Saints Hall circa 66 and had my first experience of the Pink Floyd, I had no idea that this was a Hoppy fundraising event for the Free School.</p> <p>From All Saints Hall to the Roundhouse, the birth of UFO, and peaking with the 14-Hour Technicolor Dream, Hoppy provided the initiative for underground music to blossom. The music, the drugs and the alternative literature were all strands that made up 60s anti-establishment way of thinking and the idea was to become a self-financing universe. Hoppy emerged as a natural leader and - along with other alternative vigilantes such as Jim Haynes, founder of the Arts Lab, and Miles, who with John Dunbar opened the Indica Gallery - led the way like a psychedelic Pied Piper into the land of stoned consciousness.</p> <p>A jazz-crazy public schoolboy who became a nuclear physicist, Hoppy really preferred the company of beatniks to whitecoats and, after going round Russia in a hearse, he parted company with the Atomic Energy Commission in 1960. In those days, all roads led to Aldermaston, and the CND issue was already part of Hoppy's political education: \"Easter Monday, the last day of the 1964 march, was the peak of CND; it was just before the Wilson government got elected and everybody was optimistic because up to this point he'd been strongly anti-nuclear. But as soon as Labour got into government he did an about-face, went pro-nuclear, and Wedgwood Benn set up the nuclear police.</p> <p>\"I was working for the Labour party as a photographer in the run-up to this election but, when it came to getting my fees, they ripped me off badly. Those two things really turned me sour. So when I saw everyone jumping up and down voting for Blair a few years ago it made me retch - I've seen these demagogues before. I got my education in the 60s, it's a hard lesson and it doesn't go away. Regretfully, CND has been going downhill for the past 30-odd years; now what we're concerned with is nuclear waste.\"</p> <p>Before starting his job at the heart of National Defence, he'd been on the Oxford scene, where he'd met Michael Horovitz, the poet, and a crowd of beats who had started the Liverpool poetry and jazz scene, like Spike Hawkins and Johnny Byrne. In the early 60s everyone was homing in on London. Hoppy arrived with a camera and did some photojournalism, and \"a little buying and selling of what might now be called illegal substances, but I'm sure they weren't then\". Hired by Horovitz to do the publicity for the 1965 Albert Hall Poetry Reading, Hoppy still had his camera round his neck when he ended up in a flat in Belgravia at four in the morning. Allen Ginsberg was celebrating his 39th birthday by taking off all his clothes. That's when John Lennon walked in and was shocked enough to say: \"You can't do that in front of the birds.\"</p> <p>The Albert Hall Poetry Reading had been a seminal gathering of minds, and Hoppy and Miles decided an underground newspaper was needed. Miles had already founded Lovebooks, with himself, Hoppy and the hip accountant Mike Henshaw on the board. To fund the newspaper, which was to be known as IT, the \"International Times First All-Night Rave Pop Op Costume Masque Drag Ball Et Al\" was launched at Camden's Roundhouse. The Beatles came in fancy dress, Italian director Michelangelo Antonioni (in town to make Blow-Up) brought Monica Vitti, and there was an enormous jelly that got squelched by the Pink Floyd's Transit.</p> <p>The early editions of IT were an intense mixture of radical thinking and avant-garde carryings-on, but at least you could look in the listings and check out where to get your macro-biotics and what groups were playing at UFO. Says Hoppy: \"IT was impossible as a proposition and that's why it happened, because we didn't know it was impossible and if we had known it was impossible we wouldn't have done it.\" By now he had stopped taking photos, too busy with IT and organising UFO, in between stunts like trying to scale Nelson's Column dressed up as Superman. His personal life had also been thrown \"into a state that it had never been in before\"; he was having a scene with Suzy Creamcheese, a runaway Californian heiress who'd been a groupie in the Hollywood hills, whom he later married when he was released from prison.</p> <p>The establishment didn't like the language, or the anti-politics, that IT was propagating, and it didn't like the kind of people who read IT and burnt joss sticks. They raided the offices of IT on various occasions, and soon the whole alternative kingdom itself was put under the screw, with busts and harassment from the drug squad becoming a daily news item in our life. Hoppy, who finally faced Nemesis in June 1967, lectured the court on the delights of cannabis, was labelled \"a pest to society\" and sentenced to nine months. As a protest to Hoppy's incarceration, the Soma Research Association organised the Cannabis Law Reform advertisement in the Times, paid for by the Beatles and containing 65 heavy-duty signatures including Francis Crick and Graham Greene.</p> <p>Hoppy remembers prison as a monochrome experience, apart from an unscheduled LSD trip: \"When you want to take something into prison you wrap it up and stick it up your arse, and I lost it up there. It released itself over a number of days, and it was intense. I wound up in the hospital. I wasn't enjoying it, because they'd sent me to Pentonville - which was for recidivists - purposely to give me a bit of a nasty experience, and that's where the acid hit me. It took a week to get out of Pentonville and into the Scrubs. I didn't tell them what had happened with the acid; I cried a lot in the beginning - it's quite upsetting if you're in jail on a trip. They took me off to the prison hospital and filled me full of Largactyl, which makes you a bit dopey.

The next step is to send a deep-water robot and two-man submarine to take a look, about 120m (394ft) below the surface. The team hopes this will produce some solid evidence - not least for the 350 investors who are funding their venture.</p> <p>Documents which Mr Pagan and his team say they have unearthed suggest that the ship's cargo is worth just under \u00a3300m in today's money.</p> <p>The cargo was unusually large, according to Mr Pagan, because many of the goods were to have gone on the galleon Magallanes but were transferred to the more seaworthy Esperanza.</p> <p>\"This is not just a treasure hunt,\" said Eusebio Dizon, the head of underwater archaeology at the national museum of the Philippines in Manila.</p> <p>\"It is a major archaeological project that has only come to light through serious scientific research. It is, for example, much bigger than the [recovered Tudor ship] Mary Rose.\"</p> <p>The museum has become part of the venture: Mr Pagan's team gets exploration permits from Manila, and in exchange the musem is meant to receive 30% of anything recovered, and first choice on items of exceptional importance.</p> <p>According to research by the project team, the Esperanza was carrying most of the wealth of the Spanish govern ment when it hit a reef and sank after the captain was ordered to deviate from the normal route to pick up more cargo on the southern island of Mindanao. All the crew were rescued.</p> <p>Esperanza's cargo included jewellery made by Filipino and Chinese artisans, and local and Chinese ceramics and pottery which could be of major historical importance, according to Mr Dizon.</p>",

In the best tradition of such enterprises, it is said to have begun by chance when one of Mr Pagan's researchers stumbled on an old document in a musty archive in Spain. \"We are 99% sure we have identified the Esperanza,\" said Mr Pagan, a former US navy sailor. \"I'm not going to say 100% until we have something physical in our hands.\" What the team have at the moment are about 50 \"humps\" on a patch of seabed off the Panagatan Cays, a cluster of three small islands. One of the humps has a trail of debris leading to shallow water where artefacts from the same period as the Esperanza have been identified, according to the group. The next step is to send a deep-water robot and two-man submarine to take a look, about 120m (394ft) below the surface. The team hopes this will produce some solid evidence - not least for the 350 investors who are funding their venture. Documents which Mr Pagan and his team say they have unearthed suggest that the ship's cargo is worth just under \u00a3300m in today's money. The cargo was unusually large, according to Mr Pagan, because many of the goods were to have gone on the galleon Magallanes but were transferred to the more seaworthy Esperanza. \"This is not just a treasure hunt,\" said Eusebio Dizon, the head of underwater archaeology at the national museum of the Philippines in Manila. \"It is a major archaeological project that has only come to light through serious scientific research. It is, for example, much bigger than the [recovered Tudor ship] Mary Rose.\" The museum has become part of the venture: Mr Pagan's team gets exploration permits from Manila, and in exchange the musem is meant to receive 30% of anything recovered, and first choice on items of exceptional importance. According to research by the project team, the Esperanza was carrying most of the wealth of the Spanish govern ment when it hit a reef and sank after the captain was ordered to deviate from the normal route to pick up more cargo on the southern island of Mindanao. All the crew were rescued. Esperanza's cargo included jewellery made by Filipino and Chinese artisans, and local and Chinese ceramics and pottery which could be of major historical importance, according to Mr Dizon.",

      "body": "<p>A month from now, George W Bush, the governor of the state that executes far more people than any other, may be elected the next US president. Yet in this year's election, the death penalty is barely mentioned or discussed. Like Bush, his opponent Al Gore is a capital punishment man, as all but a handful of US politicians are too. As a result, a system of punishment that helps to define modern America for many people in Europe - and that puts the penal system of the world's greatest democracy on a par with those of Iraq, Pakistan and China - has not even rated a mention in the presidential debates. </p> <p>But, extraordinarily, the issue of the death penalty has produced a new, full-length American opera, which had its premiere at the San Francisco Opera House this weekend. At the close, members of the audience wept, and the emotion was almost as strong outside the opera house as within. As a torchlit vigil reminded the opera-goers, California alone currently has no fewer than 572 prisoners awaiting execution on death row. </p> <p>It is hard to imagine that any composer can ever have written a more directly topical opera than the American composer Jake Heggie. Heggie's Dead Man Walking, his first opera, with a libretto by the currently ubiquitous dramatist Terrence McNally, is an adaptation of Sister Helen Prejean's account of her work with Louisiana's death row inmates. And, although Heggie's opera is universal in its themes and moral scope, it is also aesthetically and culturally a distinctively American opera. To see it in an American theatre, performed by American artists, with an American audience is to experience a special collective intensity. </p> <p>As the critic and writer Peter Conrad has said, almost all opera is in some sense a song about love and death. But Conrad's description applies with special force to Dead Man Walking. Death dominates and pervades the whole evening, from the savage opening murder scene, which leaves no question about Joseph De Rocher's guilt, to his final execution by legal injection, enacted in a terrible silence that goes beyond even the ability of music to express. </p> <p>But song is there too, and so is love. Just as in Sister Helen's book, and just as in Tim Robbins's Oscar-winning 1996 movie, the central subject of the opera is not death so much as love. \"I love you,\" sings De Rocher in his final words as he is strapped to the execution table. \"I love you, too,\" Sister Helen responds. Then there is silence, broken only by the sounds of the death machinery, and then silence again. Finally, unaccompanied, Susan Graham as Sister Helen sings a spiritual: rich, southern and affirmative. </p> <p>It is a tribute to Heggie's score and to his handling of such an unremittingly serious subject that he manages to move occasionally into lighter vein without it seeming inappropriate. Like many contemporary American composers, Heggie can slip easily in and out of various styles. In this case, hymns and rock'n'roll vary the musical mood and pace at key moments. McNally's text helps enormously too, darting into brief exchanges between the characters that help to establish theatrical contours and real relationships. </p> <p>Dead Man Walking is not an \"anti-death penalty\" opera in an agitprop sense. It works as a drama precisely because it catches subtleties and nuances. De Rocher is not a nice man or even a martyr. The death row prisoners are scary not noble. The prison governor is caught between keeping order and wanting to behave decently. And the most immediately accessible characters in the drama are the victims' parents, who continually confront Sister Helen with their own terrible losses. </p> <p>If the most overwhelming scene in the opera is, appropriately, the execution, the runner-up is the sextet between the victims' parents, Sister Helen and De Rocher's hapless mother, sung with huge emotional directness by Frederica von Stade. \"You don't know what it's like,\" the parents sing in a series of heartbreaking overlapping lines. They are right. Sister Helen doesn't know, though she is learning. Moments like this make the opera truly dramatic. By any conceivable standards, Dead Man Walking is a big opera emotionally. That's part of what one instantly respects about it. Many modern operas avoid emotionally big subjects in favour of attitude and obscurity. There is not an ounce of those things here. Seriousness, on its own, may not be enough, but it is a very useful start. </p> <p>Heggie is an unabashed melodist, as he said himself at a symposium on the eve of the premiere. His music is rich and emotionally charged, betraying varied influences from Mussorgsky to Britten and Ravel, and carries enormous atmospheric power. The orchestral writing is full of interest and subtlety, and with Patrick Summers in the pit to bring the score to life, Heggie manages to build musical tension in a way that shows astonishing maturity for someone writing his first large- scale dramatic work. There is a sweep to this work which can only be called inspired. </p> <p>Oddly, however, given Heggie's growing reputation as a writer for the voice - his more than 50 published songs have been recorded by some of the most lustrous names in the singing world - the one nagging uncertainty concerned his handling of the vocal line. Heggie's characteristic phrases almost always turn downwards, closing in on themselves, rather than expanding to more ambitious directions. After a while, this risks becoming predictable. </p> <p>But such reservations must be put in perspective. Heggie's achievement is simply immense. There was scarcely a moment in the evening when one was not aware of the high purposes of great art. Graham was at the core of the evening, rarely off the stage, singing her heart out in rich-toned directness. Joe Mantello's production is unerring, with studied and effective simplicity (and a few good gags) the hallmark. Dead Man Walking makes the most concentrated impact of any piece of American music theatre since West Side Story more than 40 years ago. San Francisco, one of the great patron houses of contemporary opera, has a historic achievement on its hands.</p>",

Surely these resources could be better allocated helping to alleviate homelessness and providing warmth and food to those on the streets? To prevent yet another government-inspired public relations disaster, ministers should scrap this misguided idea at once. Alex Belardinelli Leeds",

      "bodyText": "Teaching Pages **** Aimed at: teachers Assess your own attitude to PSHE and access some of the resources used by Exeter University's PGCE course on this site of the Schools Health Education Unit. Brain Pop - Health **** Aimed at: KS3 Engaging US movie shorts about health concerns for adolescents (inc acne and periods) as well as more general aspects of human biology. Samaritans *** Aimed at: everyone Includes the Samaritans Youth Pack for schools, statistics on suicide, and an engrossing survey of young men's attitudes towards their own distress. The latter is free but available only by post. Some material is also in Welsh. Generation Sex *** Aimed at: teenagers Flashy new site from Channel 4 with a question-and-answer service that visitors can browse: some are quite explicit and might worry more conservative teachers and parents. The ABC of Sex is a good reference for queries about particular words, and there is a strong section for girls who have had unprotected sex. See also the government's MindBodySoul website for PSHE. DrugScope **** Aimed at: everyone Formerly the Institute for the Study of Drugs Dependence and the Standing Conference on Drug Abuse, DrugScope has a large education section and an online drugs encyclopaedia of considerable depth. The Red Spot ***** Aimed at: everyone Subtitled Menstrual Culture, this site examines the physiological, historical and emotional aspects of the subject in an entertaining, intelligent way. Very helpful for anyone giving a talk. Police Services UK *** Aimed at: everyone Every police force has its own website, and those of the Met and West Yorkshire Police are particularly interesting.They could prove useful if you want to engage pupils' interest by looking at the role of the local police. Smoking and Health **** Aimed at: everyone ASH has a dedicated schools section. It does not patronise its audience and nor condemn smokers outright. Could be easier to use with KS4 students? AIDSmap *** Aimed at: everyone Links to a variety of research and resources on Aids. Alcohol Concern www.alcoholconcern.org.uk *** Aimed at: everyone Probably its most useful feature are the factsheets on alcohol covering, among other topics, women's drinking and the scale of consumption. Euthanasia links No star rating; it's a Guardian site Aimed at: everyone This page links to campaigning organisations such as the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child, the Voluntary Euthanasia Society and the Catholic position on abortion. See more PSHE sites and a back catalogue of all subjects covered so far at Guardian netclass or contact Ros Taylor at ros.taylor@theguardian.com",

This infuriated the local Palestinians and the rioting began. During his visit, Sharon inspected The Temple Mount - a small area containing the Dome of the Rock. This is the third most holy Muslim site, from where Mohammed is believed to have ascended into heaven.

He is hated because in 1982 he had the power to stop the massacre of Palestinian refugees in neighbouring Lebanon but did nothing. </p> <p> <strong> Why is Jerusalem the source of such conflict?</strong> </p> <p> Jerusalem is not just any city. It is where many Jewish Israelis and the Palestinians would like their capital to be. The Temple Mount is thought by Jews to be the site of the Second Temple. Its destruction by the Romans in 70AD began nearly 2,000 years of Jewish exile from the Holy Land. Jews began returning to what was then Palestine in the 1880s, but Israel came into existence only in 1948. </p> <p>In 1967, in the Six Day War, Israel attacked and defeated its neighbours Jordan, Syria and Egypt, which had threatened war. As part of that victory it conquered the eastern part of Jerusalem (the city was already divided) and a large area of land up to the River Jordan. This has become known as the West Bank. The Israelis have been told to give this land back by the United Nations. </p> <p> <strong> Why are Palestinians and Israelis in conflict?</strong> </p> <p> Just as the Israelis regard these lands as home, so too do the Palestinians. They hoped that after the first world war, when the Middle East was freed from Turkish control, they would be given space to create a Palestinian state. This never happened. Instead the British, who were in charge of the region, tried to get them to accept splitting the land into Jewish and Palestinian sections, with Jerusalem an \"international city\" looked after by the United Nations. </p> <p>The Palestinians rejected this and joined with their Arab neighbours in trying to destroy Israel in 1948. This war also resulted in Arab defeat. Over one million Palestinians were driven from their homes, ending up in refugee camps all over the Middle East. </p> <p>Israel's victory in the 1967 Six Day War meant that those Palestinians living on the West Bank, taken from Jordan, found themselves under Israeli occupation. This tense situation has not been improved by the arrival of more than 161,000 Jewish settlers who have taken land since then on the West Bank and in another occupied area called Gaza (now controlled by the Palestinian Authority). </p> <p> <strong> What efforts have been made to sort out all these problems?</strong> </p> <p> Negotiating peace in the Middle East has been painfully slow. The first breakthrough came in 1979 when Egypt recognised Israel's right to exist. The Israeli leader who did most to promote peace was Yitzhak Rabin, but his willingness to talk to the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) at Oslo was unacceptable to some extremists and led to his assassination. Progress was being made in talks between the current Israeli leader, Ehud Barak, and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat (overseen by President Clinton), until these troubles began. </p> <p> <strong> What are the key issues in these negotiations?</strong> </p> <p> Agreement is needed about those Palestinian refugees wishing to return home, the Jewish settlers and control of West Bank water resources. These may be complicated matters but are simple compared to the issue of Jerusalem, though even there there have recently been signs of a possible compromise. </p> <p> <strong> Is the fighting in anyone's interest?</strong> </p> <p> The conflict is clearly putting pressure on the Israeli leader, Barak, and focusing world attention on the Palestinian cause. Some experts have suggested that is why the Palestinian authorities have been slow to halt their people's street protests. But Barak has elections coming up and does not want to appear weak.

      "bodyText": "Yuk! Pardon? You're surely not going to consume that thing. Dead right I am You're really going to eat it? Well, I'm not going to sit here and stroke it. But it's sheer poison. Rubbish! It's a chocolate \u00e9clair. Precisely. Think of the damage it'll do. Nothing to what I'll do if I'm not left in peace to enjoy it. Well, really. Haven't you heard of healthy eating? I hear nothing else all day, madam. I'm a nutritionist. Never! And I'm a hungry one at that, so ... But that's fascinating. What do you do exactly? We nutritionists promote the understanding of the effects of diet on the health of animals and humans by applying scientific knowledge, or dietetics. I thought that was scientology. Certainly not. So what is it? It's simply the interpretation and communication of the science of nutrition to enable people to make informed and practical choices about food and lifestyle. You mean like telling them not to eat chocolate \u00e9clairs? Give it a rest. What's the difference between dietetics and nutrition? All dietetics courses include nutrition but all nutrition courses do not lead to a qualification in dietetics. Er, right. What qualities are needed? We require a basic interest and ability in science. And obviously an interest in diet and food, beyond the usual liking for the stuff, that is. Anything else? Good communication skills and team-working skills would be preferred. And you mustn't be judgmental. Perish the thought. Are there different specialities? Yes. There's animal nutrition, the study and promotion of the health of all animals: livestock, pets, wild animals and so forth.

Social exclusion? \"Apart from anything else, we run courses in Pentonville Prison and the offices of the Big Issue.\" Lifelong learning? \"We have more students over 90 than under 19.\" Blanche d'Arbeloff was 93 when she joined an art class in 1986. \"She wouldn't stay with the over-60s class because she felt it wasn't stretching her enough,\" beams head of art Suzanna Jackson. Like any college principal, Freestone worries about funding. Course fees cover less than 35% of his \u00a31.3m budget. \"The Further Education Funding Council has been wonderful for this institution,\" Freestone says. But it is to be abolished and replaced by the Learning and Skills Council. \"There's a lot of rhetoric about lifelong learning and social capital, but funding may only come with leverage to meet national targets.\" More and more pieces of paper, in other words. Only a third of Mary Ward students are on courses leading to qualifications, but the centre's effect on the blighted lives of refugees and impoverished locals is immeasurable.",

But don't fret, JL. The principal of South East Essex college of arts and technology wasn't planning some haberdashery heist. </p> <p>Tony Pitcher was seeking inspiration. He was about to ask a firm of architects to design new premises for his college, and he was going to issue probably the oddest request in the history of further education construction. </p> <p>\"Build me a department store.\" </p> <p>The architects, KSS, of Savile Row, took it on the chin. \"If we'd asked them to build us a new college, they would have had all sorts of preconceptions of what a college should look like,\" explains Pitcher, who prefers the title chief executive. \"So we said we wanted it to be like a department store. </p> <p>\"They were absolutely enthusiastic. They thought it was a really interesting architectural challenge, and not just another boring old technical college.\" </p> <p>Now the Further Education Funding Council has given its blessing to the \"relocation\" and, provided a couple of minor planning issues can be sorted, work should begin on this \u00a340m project next year. </p> <p>Sometime in 2003, it will open. And the punters will be forgiven for thinking they've strayed into Grace Brothers because, apart from the proposed college's design, it will share the new complex in the centre of Southend with some real shops in a brand new mall. Any shopper taking the wrong escalator from the atrium floor will miss Boots and fetch up in the college foyer. </p> <p>For a biggish chunk of the population, who get dragged under protest from Saturday sport on the telly, the typical department store is a foretaste of hell. So why would a college want to ape one? It's clearly no sudden whim. Over the past decade, since Pitcher took over as principal in 1991 of the then Southend college of technology, it has developed a style of operation that is radically different from the traditional model. </p> <p>As in a big store, there are no internal divisions. Learning is not done in classrooms, Pitcher says. It takes place in 20 \"learning centres\" - big rooms of up to 500 square metres. </p> <p>In each of these up to half a dozen groups of students learn. They're likely to be doing different courses, or at least different levels of the same course. The groups are served by teachers and \"learning advisers\" who assist students with particular problems. </p> <p>\"Teachers don't lecture except to give very short explanations of a concept when necessary,\" Pitcher explains. \"And students don't waste time copying down material which the teacher has taken from a book and copied out on the whiteboard.\" </p> <p>\"We're trying to avoid inefficient ways of communicating information,\" chips in David Howe, director of quality assurance. </p> <p>So where do students get their stuff? </p> <p>\"They get their material from worksheets and our intranet,\" says Pitcher. </p> <p>The college certainly bristles with computers. This is apparent when the principal, Howe and David Latham, director of resource development, take the Guardian on a tour of the current premises near Southend Victoria station, and half a mile from the new site in the town centre. </p> <p>This five-floor steel-framed and glass building was designed in the late 1950s along standard technical college lines. But now there are no walls, or very few. The television and sound recording studios, for instance, are enclosed, and for obvious reasons. </p> <p>\"Students get the feeling of working for a large purposeful organisation, not as an isolated group with one teacher,\" says Pitcher. \"It's the sort of busy beehive feeling or of being in a modern department store. We're preparing students for a modern working environment.\" </p> <p>Howe recalls one visitor remarking that it was more like a building society than a college. \"I think they were being damning. I saw it as a compliment.\" </p> <p>Removing walls boosts student performance and improves behaviour, the trio firmly believe. \"It has been shown that students' behaviour is moderated by the size of the space they're in and the presence of people doing other activities ,\" says Howe. \"An NVQ student might be energised by seeing people doing an HND in the same subject,\" says Latham. </p> <p>The transition to the new style caused student recruitment to double from 1992 to 1995, says Pitcher. The college now has 3,550 full-time and 6,000 part-time students. </p> <p>And how do teaching staff feel, exposed to such open display rather than safe in their own enclosed domains? </p> <p>The revolution required gradual introduction and thorough explanation. Quite a few staff back in the early 1990s were apprehensive and there was a significant dash for early retirement, says Pitcher. \"But after a while the nervous staff were those whose departments we hadn't yet introduced this method to.\" </p> <p>The open-plan, learning-centre mode benefits teachers in many ways, he says. They pick up skills from their colleagues, who learn from them in return. And any problems they have are quickly spotted. </p> <p>\"The old method depends heavily on the skills of each teacher, who alone had to manage the learning of 25 to 30 people.\" </p> <p>In the traditional classroom, even the most promising rookie teacher takes a few years to find out what works. In their own capsules they get little or no help from colleagues. Meanwhile, their students don't get the best. </p> <p>The openness extends to the learning materials which staff produce. It's all the intellectual property of the college and has to be entered onto the intranet to be available to the next teachers needing it. </p> <p>The college gets an increasing number of visitors from colleges here and overseas. Recently a delegation from Benenden, Princess Anne's old school, came calling and showed great interest in the learning centre method. Other colleges have adopted part of the method. Some had tried it and concluded it doesn't work. </p> <p>It is a \"student-centred\" approach, says Pitcher. And like the \"child-centred\" methods so reviled as trendy nonsense by rightwing newspapers over the past decade it attracts suspicion. </p> <p>\"It shouldn't be underestimated,\" says Howe. \"It's complex and only works if the whole jigsaw is in place. </p> <p>\"When critics say it doesn't work, it's because they haven't fitted in all the pieces of the jigsaw.\"</p>",

The groups are served by teachers and \"learning advisers\" who assist students with particular problems. \"Teachers don't lecture except to give very short explanations of a concept when necessary,\" Pitcher explains. \"And students don't waste time copying down material which the teacher has taken from a book and copied out on the whiteboard.\" \"We're trying to avoid inefficient ways of communicating information,\" chips in David Howe, director of quality assurance. So where do students get their stuff? \"They get their material from worksheets and our intranet,\" says Pitcher. The college certainly bristles with computers. This is apparent when the principal, Howe and David Latham, director of resource development, take the Guardian on a tour of the current premises near Southend Victoria station, and half a mile from the new site in the town centre. This five-floor steel-framed and glass building was designed in the late 1950s along standard technical college lines. But now there are no walls, or very few. The television and sound recording studios, for instance, are enclosed, and for obvious reasons. \"Students get the feeling of working for a large purposeful organisation, not as an isolated group with one teacher,\" says Pitcher. \"It's the sort of busy beehive feeling or of being in a modern department store. We're preparing students for a modern working environment.\" Howe recalls one visitor remarking that it was more like a building society than a college. \"I think they were being damning. I saw it as a compliment.\" Removing walls boosts student performance and improves behaviour, the trio firmly believe. \"It has been shown that students' behaviour is moderated by the size of the space they're in and the presence of people doing other activities ,\" says Howe. \"An NVQ student might be energised by seeing people doing an HND in the same subject,\" says Latham. The transition to the new style caused student recruitment to double from 1992 to 1995, says Pitcher. The college now has 3,550 full-time and 6,000 part-time students. And how do teaching staff feel, exposed to such open display rather than safe in their own enclosed domains? The revolution required gradual introduction and thorough explanation. Quite a few staff back in the early 1990s were apprehensive and there was a significant dash for early retirement, says Pitcher. \"But after a while the nervous staff were those whose departments we hadn't yet introduced this method to.\" The open-plan, learning-centre mode benefits teachers in many ways, he says. They pick up skills from their colleagues, who learn from them in return. And any problems they have are quickly spotted. \"The old method depends heavily on the skills of each teacher, who alone had to manage the learning of 25 to 30 people.\" In the traditional classroom, even the most promising rookie teacher takes a few years to find out what works. In their own capsules they get little or no help from colleagues. Meanwhile, their students don't get the best. The openness extends to the learning materials which staff produce. It's all the intellectual property of the college and has to be entered onto the intranet to be available to the next teachers needing it. The college gets an increasing number of visitors from colleges here and overseas. Recently a delegation from Benenden, Princess Anne's old school, came calling and showed great interest in the learning centre method. Other colleges have adopted part of the method. Some had tried it and concluded it doesn't work. It is a \"student-centred\" approach, says Pitcher. And like the \"child-centred\" methods so reviled as trendy nonsense by rightwing newspapers over the past decade it attracts suspicion. \"It shouldn't be underestimated,\" says Howe. \"It's complex and only works if the whole jigsaw is in place. \"When critics say it doesn't work, it's because they haven't fitted in all the pieces of the jigsaw.\"",

It's part of the UK Sports Institute, a John Major vision which was expected to achieve just the kind of Olympic success British athletes have just delivered.

This is part of a \u00a3120m lottery-funded investment in sport, much of which will be spent on university-based facilities at the nine regional centres of the UK Sports Institute. Loughborough, Manchester Met, Sheffield, East Anglia, Southampton and Birmingham will also receive infrastructure investment, with separate funding for projects in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. </p> <p>But why the delay? Conservative plans for the institute involved massive spending on one national centre to be based in Sheffield.

I would travel from the centre of Sydney out to the swimming centre and I would pass four 50m pools on the way. Australia has 1,500 such pools. We have six, and only one - here at Bath - has been built since the last games in Atlanta.\" </p> <p>At Loughborough, Rod Thorpe is waiting for final clearance for nearly \u00a325m of investment on campus. The university will have one of those 50-metre pools, along with new indoor track and field facilities, new artificial pitches, centres for badminton and netball and a gymnastics analysis centre. </p> <p>Both universities see the funding as a chance to open up higher education to more young people. Bath has introduced a HND specifically designed for young athletes, while Loughborough have worked on strategies which allow sports development and university level study to co-exist. </p> <p>\"We try to take a flexible approach,\" says Thorpe. \"But you have to be careful - some laboratory-based courses are difficult to take time out from.\" </p> <p>So when might we expect a return on the current investment? \"Logic would say 2008,\" says Thorpe. \"Results from investment in infrastructure are bound to take a little longer.

The current models of assessment used in universities are already a bad fit to technology-based courses. If a student uses a personal computer as a routine tool for much of their studying and practical work in a topic like computer-aided diagnosis; and if professionals always use computer-based tools; then it is stupid to forbid the use of a computer during exams. Eventually it will be taken as normal that students use personal computers for assessment, including three-hour exams.

The e-university must be able to offer an e-library that is the union rather than the intersection of the online digital information services offered by the participating universities.

But as ubiquitous and omniscient advisers cannot be found in ordinary-sized real universities or out in internet space, designing effective navigation services will be a challenge. The suggestion proposed of offering learners a choice of competitive navigators is loopy. Multiple navigators would require the creation of meta-navigators to help the learners choose between them.

A machine agent can offer automated tutorial advice and some students may find it helpful and relevant. But the struggling student may find the advice meaningless and a mature student may find it pointless or patronising. </p> <p>The design of interactive support depends crucially on the grain-size of the smallest learning module.

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of UK students are set to follow in the footsteps of Laura Spence and study in the US, as the top Ivy League schools intensify their recruitment drives in the UK this year. Leading the charge of US admissions officers across the Atlantic is Dartmouth College, which is targeting talented state school pupils failing to get into Oxbridge and may even poach students already on UK degree courses. Dartmouth has already secured at least one application from another pupil at Laura Spence's former school. Harvard admissions staff, meanwhile, say they are experiencing much more interest from UK students this year, particularly from the north of the country. Many believe the controversy over Spence's rejection by Oxford has made other state pupils much more aware of the opportunities available in the US. This has exaggerated an existing trend.

      "body": "<p>There are probably very few of us who would relish going back to our old school, bumping into teachers we thought we'd seen the back of, but for some former pupils from Bridley Moor High School in Redditch, this is exactly what they wanted. At Bridley Moor, more than 10% of the teaching staff are ex-pupils. Acting head Val Duffy-Cross thinks this is because \"there's a spirit here ... a warmth and a community. The students feel safe and secure.\" So safe, apparently, that some can't bear to leave. </p> <p>A mixed comprehensive for children aged 13-18, the school currently has 894 pupils. Nine out of the school's 79 teaching staff studied here. They can be found in most departments - from maths and English to science and humanities - and their ages span generations, from the eldest, Roy Hooper, 57, who returned to the school in 1966, to the youngest, new recruit Kate Jones, 19, a special needs classroom assistant. </p> <p>So what is it that compels students to come back and teach there? When Kate Jones took time out from her degree the school offered her a temporary position as a classroom assistant. \"I loved it here so I didn't think twice about returning,\" she says. </p> <p>Jones finds that being so close in age to the pupils means she can relate to their problems in class. \"Some of my friends are still in the sixth form, but we now have to act in a different way because there are boundaries. If I meet a friend in the corridor, I would normally give them a hug but as a member of staff that's unthinkable.\" </p> <p>Melanie Bullivant, 22 and also a classroom assistant, has returned to Bridley Moor for a year before starting a social work course. \"I used to get on with the staff really well so it's been great to come back knowing everyone.\" Bullivant was the head student tutor in her sixth form. \"The strangest thing is having to call the staff by their first names. I can't get used to that at all.\" </p> <p>Steve Dunton, 28, now head of religious education, sent his CV to the school six years ago when he was between jobs. \"At Bridley Moor I had felt more a part of a family than a school, so when I returned to teaching I wanted to give something back.\" </p> <p>And like a family, the relationships between staff can be complicated. Kate Jones was taught by Sally Smith, 42, now an English teacher, who herself was taught by Roy Hooper. \"The students I've taught, such as Sally and Melanie, have their own reasons for coming back of course,\" says Hooper. \"But if they want to teach here, their relationships with the staff have already been built.\" The family atmosphere could also be attributed to members of staff knowing each for a long time, as Smith knows well: \"I think back to times when I taught two or three of the other members of staff, and it's quite sobering because it makes you feel old.\" </p> <p>The staff at Bridley Moor are adamant that the high proportion of \"returners\" is a good sign, and, on the whole, the experts agree. \"They understand the culture, the standards and the values of the school and will be able to contribute usefully because they've already bought in to that,\" says Ben Williams, a chartered corporate psychologist based in Edinburgh. \"These teachers recognise they gained a lot from the school and want to 'pay back' something.\" </p> <p>But, Williams warns, if teachers return to their former school without teaching elsewhere, like Bridley Moor's younger members of staff have done, they risk losing the essential life experience that will inform their teaching. \"My concern is if they are going out of academia having qualified as teachers, and don't go to other schools first, it can create a very blinkered attitude to life in general.\" </p> <p>Bridley Moor's Ofsted inspection report is impressive, reporting GCSE results above the national norm, and sixth-form attainment that is \"overwhelmingly satisfactory\". The report also mentions the successful relationships between staff and students. \"The teachers don't talk down to you, they talk to you and school feels so friendly,\" says 18-year-old head girl Claire Harris. \"I must like it here because I come back every night - my part-time job is cleaning the school.\" </p> <p>Sadly, Bridley Moor will close its doors to pupils in August 2001 after a local authority review decided that three of the five secondary schools in Redditch should close. Emotion has run high: \"I would have loved to have sent my children here,\" laments Kate Jones. Ben Williams thinks it's a shame, too: \"It sounds like there is a lot of love in that school, and we need more of that.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>There are invisible children in our schools. Ask teachers and they immediately recall examples - the excruciatingly shy pupils who seemed to melt into the background, visibly shrinking when questions were asked or averting their eyes when addressed. </p> <p>At break they were the forlorn figures standing apart from the hurly-burly. They were the troubled ones who never gave any trouble. </p> <p>Kim Gregory is worried about her nine-year-old, Gary: \"He is very lonely but he tries to dismiss his problems. He says, 'Oh, I don't mind, don't worry'. He's so ultra considerate - always at the back of the line, the one who gets the last sweet when they are being handed out. I fear one day he will explode.\" </p> <p>A Hampshire mother, unwilling to reveal her identity, tells a similar tale of her 12-year-old: \"He is completely lacking in self-confidence and is becoming very isolated. He is unnaturally well behaved. The teachers say he is so 'nice and polite', but they don't see how sad he is at home. His behaviour is convenient for them.\" </p> <p>It's a view shared by health campaigners and professionals. \"Children who act out will get the most notice,\" says Juliet Buckley of the charity Young Minds. Jeanette Newton of the Dudley Counselling Service feels that concern and funding is flowing predominantly to disruptive children. </p> <p>But for children whose instinct it is to internalise their worries, the consequences of having their troubles overlooked can have profound consequences. Last year's \"Bright Futures\" report from The Mental Health Foundation identified communication difficulties and low self-esteem as key risk factors likely to contribute to children developing a mental health problem. </p> <p>One organisation that focuses on the plight of the withdrawn child is the charity The Pyramid Trust. Since 1992, it has promoted a programme aimed at children of seven to nine - an age, according to the American psychologist Mortimer Schiffer, in which their main \"social hunger\" is for peer-acceptance. \"In our view this is the ideal time to intervene,\" says the trust's chief executive, Alan Watson. \"Every child deserves to have early signs of failure noticed and nipped in the bud.\" </p> <p>The trust has developed an approach which it \"franchises\" out to local education or health authorities. \"They contact us and we set them up as the local 'lead agency', responsible for promoting the idea among schools and then co-ordinating things once they get started,\" explains Watson. </p> <p>The trust provides a blueprint for running the three-stage scheme. First, teachers are invited to assess their classes using checklists. Next, their \"nominations\" are discussed at a special \"multi-service\" meeting of teachers, psychologists, school nurses and representatives from educational welfare. From this gathering emerges a shortlist of 10. These pupils are invited to join a special after-school club that runs for 10 weeks and is co-ordinated by an outside volunteer, trained by The Pyramid Trust and employed by the lead organisation. </p> <p>Once parents agree their children can attend, the club meetings begin. \"Often this is the first time they have ever been selected for anything,\" says Alan Watson. \"The clubs are designed to offer six key ingredients - love, security, praise, recognition, responsibility and new experiences - the children select a club name, design badges, cook, play games and there is always an outing.

      "bodyText": "There are invisible children in our schools. Ask teachers and they immediately recall examples - the excruciatingly shy pupils who seemed to melt into the background, visibly shrinking when questions were asked or averting their eyes when addressed. At break they were the forlorn figures standing apart from the hurly-burly. They were the troubled ones who never gave any trouble. Kim Gregory is worried about her nine-year-old, Gary: \"He is very lonely but he tries to dismiss his problems. He says, 'Oh, I don't mind, don't worry'. He's so ultra considerate - always at the back of the line, the one who gets the last sweet when they are being handed out. I fear one day he will explode.\" A Hampshire mother, unwilling to reveal her identity, tells a similar tale of her 12-year-old: \"He is completely lacking in self-confidence and is becoming very isolated. He is unnaturally well behaved. The teachers say he is so 'nice and polite', but they don't see how sad he is at home. His behaviour is convenient for them.\" It's a view shared by health campaigners and professionals. \"Children who act out will get the most notice,\" says Juliet Buckley of the charity Young Minds. Jeanette Newton of the Dudley Counselling Service feels that concern and funding is flowing predominantly to disruptive children. But for children whose instinct it is to internalise their worries, the consequences of having their troubles overlooked can have profound consequences.

Ten minutes earlier when they entered the class, they were loud and rowdy, but now their concentration is rapt and they are working as a team. There is a quiet buzz about the room as if something exciting is taking place. It is. Before the session is over these children have turned some of their feelings about their daily lives, and the pressures they experience at school, at home and on the streets into a rough and ready but tender and true piece of theatre. </p> <p>You may think this kind of scene is going on in secondary schools up and done the country, but you would be wrong. There is much talk of the arts being for all, but for secondary school children in England and Wales, access to a broad range of well-taught arts education covering art, music, drama and dance is a lottery. </p> <p>A new study published today by the National Foundation for Educational Research shows that large numbers of pupils have little or no opportunity to take part in drama and dance, both of which lack status within the national curriculum, and many are leaving school feeling that their arts experience at school has had almost no impact on them. Most damagingly, almost two-thirds of a sample of more than 2,000 school leavers indicated that despite the importance music plays in most teenagers' lives, they had learnt very little from music while at secondary school. Many perceived music lessons as being elitist and equated them with a classical or music tradition that they felt was not relevant to them. </p> <p>That's the bad news. However, the report also found that young people who are exposed to good and effective arts teaching experience remarkable benefits. The biggest study into arts education in secondary school ever undertaken, Arts Education in Secondary Schools: Effects and Effectiveness*, found that pupils studying art, music, drama and dance accrued heightened enjoyment and fulfilment, an increase in skill and knowledge, advances in personal and social development, development of creativity and thinking skills and the enrichment of communication and expressive skills. As one drama teacher put it: \"It is another dimension to their lives, which isn't just a factual, mechanical dimension. It is something that is a life inside their head; it's an imaginative life; a creative life.\" </p> <p>But shifts in educational policy over the last 15 years and the introduction of a national curriculum suggest that the push to produce more literate and numerate school-leavers may also mean that we are producing school-leavers with less rich imaginative lives and fewer creative skills. The late eighties saw the decimation of school music services as the national curriculum began to take shape and headteachers started to prioritise buying computers over musical instruments. Most children who want to learn a musical instrument must pay to do so. Activities such as drama and dance have been absorbed into English and PE or have become entirely extracurricular. </p> <p>Tony Fegan, educational director of the London International Festival of Theatre, which has pioneered artist-led arts education in schools, points out :\"the generation of artists in this country who are now in their 30s were the recipients of very good arts education\". But where will the next generation of artists come from? The government may like to bask in the reflected glory of Brit art and Brit pop, but they have been slow to recognise that creative and cultural education is as important as literacy and numeracy. </p> <p>The National Foundation report should help to persuade them rather more quickly, providing as it does firm evidence that good-quality teaching of the arts in schools clearly has a beneficial impact on children and young people. From the point of view of one 13-year-old, arts educa tion means \"we get a lot of work done faster, we get more people co-operating and more people feeling happy\". Put it another way, as the authors of the report do: \"A school strong in the arts can better engage its pupils and counter disaffection and the need for exclusion.\" Now that should make the government sit up and listen. </p> <p>The research findings that early exposure to the arts greatly improves future achievement should, in an ideal world, also have an impact on current primary school policy that can condemn four- and five-year-olds in reception classes to spend more time wielding a pen than a paint brush. </p> <p>But the report's authors are very clear that it is not enough for schools to provide pupils with experience of just one or two art forms. Even in those schools with the strongest arts provision it is rare to find art, music, dance and drama all on offer. But the evidence is so clear that each of the art forms generates such distinctive benefits that the authors warn against policies which assume that the learning gains associated with one art form are broadly the same as those of the others. Dance offers increased awareness of the body and movement; art promotes expressive skills; drama nurtures empathy, and music extends active learning skills. All are necessary to create rounded individuals capable of fulfilling their potential in personal relationships, wider society and the workplace. </p> <p>The report also adds to the growing body of research that casts doubt over beliefs that participation in the arts boosts academic achievement generally. This may dismay some arts education lobbyists who have put forward claims for the so-called \"Mozart effect\" that suggests that studying music will aid pupils' maths. But as Dr John Harland, the co-author of the report, points out, the evidence for the benefits of a good arts education are now so strong that the \"Mozart effect\" is irrelevant. \"After all,\" he says \"no other subject has to justify itself by its impact on other parts of the curriculum.\" </p> <p>So how can good arts education for all be achieved? Harland argues strongly that \"if the beneficial outcomes that the arts can stimulate are to be available to all pupils, there is a pressing case for reversing the trend towards selective policies that extend inequalities between schools and which result largely in the best schools for the arts becoming better.\" Clearly specialist arts schools along the lines of design and technology col leges are not the best way forward. </p> <p>The current non-curricular status of dance and drama means that they are particularly vulnerable. As one teacher, quoted in the report, puts it: \"Heads rule OK. It's as simple as that. At the end of the day if the head wants something in the school it will happen.\" </p> <p>But if they don't, it won't. This could be countered if the contribution of dance and drama beyond that of PE and English were recognised and they were given comparable status in the national curriculum to that of art and music. Even so this has its dangers, as one teacher expresses: \"Arts is dead if there is no scope for individual creativity. You might as well not bother in my opinion. We can't encourage creativity amongst kids and expect it to thrive, if we are in a curricular straitjacket.\" Timetables to match the needs of individual art forms are essential. </p> <p>But the single most crucial factor in the success of arts education appears to be the employment of effective specialist teachers who are passionate about their subjects. The report found that individual teacher factors were more important determinants of effectiveness than whole-school factors. Children were quick to pick up the differences between the value of a PE teacher attempting to teach dance and a specialist dance teacher. They also had a clear preference for those able to demonstrate practical skill. Just as we need well-trained maths teachers, we need well-trained arts specialists with a real passion for their subject. If they are practising artists, so much the better. </p> <p>The difference good teaching can make was demonstrated by one of the schools studied, where the music department had worked very hard at showing that music at school could incorporate pupils' own musical preferences. \"We seem to have broken the barrier in school and showed that music is a cool thing to do, music is a cool place to hang out.\" If one school can do it, so can others. </p> <p>As Harland says: \"What we have to ask is how can we achieve equality of arts education for all children, not by dumbing down the best schools but by lifting the others.\" He adds: \"With this report and previous research there is now enough evidence to offer an adequate argument for politicians.\" But are they ready to listen?</p>",

The only condition is that sites carrying the press releases will have to ensure they are clearly labelled to enable readers to differentiate between a press release and a news article.</p> <p>Charles H Morin, PR Newswire's president and chief executive, said: \"After careful consideration and discussion with the media and other organisations involved, we have decided that the 15 minutes we give journalists to spread material news is no longer necessary. </p> <p>\"Once, the delay helped to level the playing field but technology and the overall effects of the internet have altered the landscape dramatically.

      "bodyText": "Internet news services in the US will be able to compete on a level playing field with financial news wires after the PR industry decided to end its practice of sending releases early to wire services. In the past financial wire services in the US always received corporate press releases 15 minutes before everyone else. This gave companies such as Reuters, Bloomberg and Dow Jones a monopoly on crucial information about company results and mergers and acquisitions, enabling them to charge professional traders large fees to access the service. But the arrival of the internet meant the practice had become outdated and PR Newswire and Businesswire, the two main disseminators of corporate press releases, have now begun sending them to websites and other news providers at the same time. This means that anyone looking for news on Yahoo or MSN will now see a release at the same time as a news wire will. The only condition is that sites carrying the press releases will have to ensure they are clearly labelled to enable readers to differentiate between a press release and a news article. Charles H Morin, PR Newswire's president and chief executive, said: \"After careful consideration and discussion with the media and other organisations involved, we have decided that the 15 minutes we give journalists to spread material news is no longer necessary. \"Once, the delay helped to level the playing field but technology and the overall effects of the internet have altered the landscape dramatically. We are now able to reach millions of investors, whether they are using the internet, cell phones, pagers or any other wireless device.\" The 15-minute delay began in the 1960s as a way of ensuring that market-sensitive information could be widely disseminated before anyone could act on it. The move does not affect the UK, where all news releases are controlled by the London Stock Exchange and the 15-minute delay will continue.",
