      "bodyText": "Late night sittings of the House of Commons, which fequently force MPs to remain at Westminster until the early hours, are to be consigned to the past as part of the most radical shake-up of parliament in more than 20 years to be unveiled today. In a move which will delight modernisers, but dismay traditionalists who like to drink through the night in Westminster's numerous bars, the business of the Commons is to be brought to an end by 10pm throughout the week. Labour backbenchers, who have been pressing for more \"family friendly\" hours, will warmly welcome the reform to be announced today by Margaret Beckett , the leader of the Commons. But Conservative MPs will criticise the end of late night sittings, saying that it will weaken the ability of the Opposition to hold the government to account. Mrs Beckett, who chairs the Commons modernisation committee which yesterday approved the reforms, will insist that the government is planning to give opposition parties a far greater role in the running of the house. In a gesture to the Tories and the Liberal Democrats, Mrs Beckett will announce the unprecedented setting up of a cross-party committee to agree on how the government arranges its business in the Commons. The committee, which was the brainchild of the Liberal Democrat chief whip Paul Tyler, will meet after the annual Queen's speech in November to try to reach agreement on the order of parliamentary bills in the following session. The government will also agree to give opposition MPs a say in how bills are debated. The government will allocate an overall time for a bill, but it will be up to MPs to decide how much time to devote to specific areas. But the greatest attention today will focus on the demise of late night sittings, which will usher in the greatest cultural change in Westminster in more than a century. Under the government's plans, strict timetabling of government business will mean that debates on bills will end at 10pm from Mondays to Wednesdays, allowing MPs to escape from Westminster after voting at around 10.30pm. MPs are already free to leave early once a week after the Commons started sitting on Thursday morning One government source said that reform of the Commons hours was long overdue. \"Most people have come to the conclusion that you cannot allow legislation to be taken through the house at 3am,\" the source said. \"This is the biggest shake-up at Westminster since the introduction of select committees in 1979.\" The source said that ministers regarded the setting up of the cross-party \"Queen's speech committee\" as an example of the government's at tempts to co-operate with other parties, most notably the Lib Dems. \"The government is particularly keen to be inclusive because that will eventually lead to better legislation,\" the source said. However, today's report will be denounced by the Tories who will dismiss it as a cynical attempt by the government to tighten its grip over the Commons. Forcing MPs to sit through the night is an old tactic deployed by opposition parties down the ages - including Labour in the 1980s - to upset the carefully choreographed timetabling of Commons business. Some Tory MPs on the modernisation committee rejected the report. The government had been criticised by some of Labour's new backbenchers for refusing to embrace change, although . it has also introduced debates in Westminster Hall, which have to be attended by the relevant minister, to give backbenchers greater scope to debate issues dear to their hearts. The reforms to the Commons will be unveiled today as MPs rounded on broadcasters for their coverage of Westminster. The all-party Commons broadcasting committee accused the BBC and ITN of \"cherry-picking\" sound bites and focusing on rows in televising parliament. However, the MPs recommended an expansion of broadcasting facilities at Westminster.",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair's 16-year-old son Euan has apologised after he was arrested last night for being \"drunk and incapable\" in London's West End. In a statement the prime minister's official spokesman, Alastair Campbell, said Mr Blair's oldest son was \"very sorry for the inconvenience he caused to the police\" as he celebrated the end of his GCSE exams. Police officers found the teenager sprawled in Leicester Square on his own at around 11pm. He initially gave a false name, age and address to the police, saying he was called Euan John, was aged 18, and lived at his old home in Islington. \"Euan was out last night with friends to mark the end of his GCSEs. The police late last night saw him lying on the ground in Leicester Square,\" Downing Street said. \"He was clearly ill and had been vomiting. An ambulance was called but ambulance personnel decided he didn't need hospital treatment and he was then taken by the police to Charing Cross. He was, in the view of the police, drunk and incapable.\" \"I think he saw the inside of a cell,\" Mr Campbell later added. Euan was released without charge and driven home by special branch officers early this morning. A Scotland Yard spokeswoman confirmed: \"A male youth was arrested at 23.00 last night in Leicester Square for being drunk and incapable. \"Police were not responding to a call regarding the person, an officer on patrol just came upon him.\" \"The options are now that he could be brought back and issued with a formal warning or he could be cautioned,\" said the spokeswoman. Mr Campbell said: \"In the near future he will have to return to Charing Cross with his parents to hear what, if any, further action is going to be taken.\" \"Being a parent is tough\" In a speech to religious leaders in Brighton, Mr Blair did his best to shake off his son's embarrassing arrest, which comes just days after the prime minister's call for police to be given powers to levy on-the-spot fines on drunken youths. Reaching a section of his speech praising values such as as \"tolerance, family, trying to bring up children properly\", Mr Blair paused, looked down and smiled. \"Er, that part was written a long time ago,\" he said. As his audience laughed the prime minister went on: \"Being a prime minister can be a tough job but I always think being a parent is probably tougher. Sometimes you don't always succeed, but the family to me is more important than anything else.\" Mr Blair and his wife Cherie have gone to great lengths to protect the privacy of their children - Euan, Nicky, 14, Kathryn, 12, and baby Leo. Asked if it was the first time Euan had been drunk, Mr Campbell said: \"It is the first time special branch have had to go and pick him up\" and added that it was the first time on \"this type of scale\". Mr Campbell said Mr Blair was up last night working on today's speech and was \"a bit worried\" that his son had not come home. He said both Mr and Mrs Blair were \"strict disciplinarians\" and insisted the incident would not stop Mr Blair spelling out his message about the need to increase individual responsibility. \"That is how he lives his life and how he brings up his children but that does not mean his children will not misbehave.\" Press coverage Lord Wakeham, chairman of the press complaints commission, said in a statement: \"The incident involving Euan Blair inevitably raises questions about the application of the editors' code of practice in relation to it. \"As Euan is over 16 and was not at school at the time of the incident there is no restriction in the code on the use of photographs of him relating to the incident or reports about the incident itself, as the prime minister and Mrs Blair themselves recognise. \"However, I am sure that on the wider front, all editors will take into account the prime minister and Mrs Blair's clear commitment to do all they can to protect the privacy of their children and will bear in mind the general provisions in the code on the reporting of private lives of children, and family life.\" Troublesome teenagers The incident comes two-and-a-half years after the teenage son of home secretary Jack Straw was caught selling cannabis to a tabloid newspaper reporter. William Straw, 17, was cautioned by police after he sold the drugs for \u00a310 to a Mirror reporter in a pub in Clapham, south London, at Christmas 1997. There were nine days of legal wrangling before William, who is now a second year student at Oxford University, could be named by the media in England. The teenager was identified in Scotland, in foreign newspapers and on the internet while a ban on naming him remained in force in the rest of the UK. After a judge ruled the ban could be lifted, the home secretary said he had been \"disturbed\" by legal issues which had prevented him \"speaking openly\" about his son's actions. The home secretary, whose post includes responsibility for youth crime and drugs policy, took his son to Kennington police station in south London to admit his drug dealing, after being warned by the Mirror of the forthcoming story.

The prisons minister, Paul Boateng, is believed to have pressed yesterday for the troubled jail - which he has already described as a \"failing institution\" - to be offered to a private prison company. Last night a prison service spokeswoman said: \"No decision has yet been taken. An announcement on the future of Brixton will be made very soon, possibly next week.\" A decision to offer Brixton to the private sector would make it the first public sector jail to be market tested and would send a shock wave through the rest of the 120 state-run prisons in England and Wales. A press briefing on the future of the jail, which had been scheduled for today, was last night cancelled at short notice. It is believed that a serious argument is going on within the prison service about whether the jail will be privatised. It is thought that inmates, often young and black, were locked up and segregated as punishment without the proper guidelines being followed. Proper procedure would include a written report to the governor followed by an adjudication hearing the next morning at which the inmate would be able to give his side of the story. A week ago the chief inspector of prisons, Sir David Ramsbotham, visited Brixton in an unannounced snap inspection. The conditions he found in the healthcare wing were so appalling he said: \"I have never seen such conditions anywhere in the country.\" He rang the director general of the prison service, Martin Narey, and demanded that he see the conditions for himself. Mr Narey has since visited Brixton. The crisis at the jail has been exacerbated by the fact that the governor, Bob Chapman, is leaving and is believed to have been unaware of what was happening. He is to be replaced by Stephen Twinn, the first prison governor to come back to the public sector from a private prison company. Mr Twinn, the first director of Group 4's Wolds prison on Humberside, has been working in Australia and is now at prison service headquarters working on a computer project. Brixton was the scene of an infamous IRA escape in the late 1980s and conditions at the prison last became a matter of national concern in the early 1990s. Since then the jail has lost its role as the main high security remand prison for major trials taking place at the Old Bailey in London. It is now used mainly as a local prison. Last night a prison service spokeswoman confirmed that market testing, or privatisation, was under consideration. \"An audit is currently looking at staff/prisoner relations, including the state of race relations within the prison.

The police set light to it. In the gun battle that followed all the rebels were shot dead except one - 17-year-old Bhagwati Chaudhary.</p> <p>According to human rights agencies, the police interrogated her, then shot her.

Then the Maoist rebels who have been fighting the Nepalese state for four years fled to a nearby village. The police caught up with them there. Six rebels unwisely took shelter in a house. The police set light to it. In the gun battle that followed all the rebels were shot dead except one - 17-year-old Bhagwati Chaudhary. According to human rights agencies, the police interrogated her, then shot her. That summary execution last month is just the latest example of extra-judicial killing in Nepal. Since 1996 the authorities have been struggling to contain the growing communist insurgency in the remote middle west of what was once a peaceful Himalayan kingdom. At least 1,500 people have been killed, two-thirds of them by the Nepalese police. \"We have very clear evidence that extra-judicial killing is going on,\" Krishna Pahadi of the Human Rights and Peace Society said. \"If the police suspect someone of being a Maoist, they simply kill them.\" The situation has become so grave that the European Union recently intervened for the first time, urging the Nepalese government not to violate human rights and to begin talks with the Maoist rebels. Nepal's hardline prime minister, Girja Koirala, who came to power in March advocating a military solution to the Maoist problem, now appears to have responded to international pressure. \"There is no alternative to talks,\" he said. But his critics say he is not serious about negotiation. The Maoist guerrillas have also been responsible for a series of outrages. Two months ago the rebels beheaded a suspected informer, leaving the victim's head in a tree.

But with \"sale\" notices now a permanent fixture in many high street shop windows, how can the consumer be sure of leaving the store with a genuine saving? </p> <p>There are, of course, regulations which aim to protect the consumer from the more unscrupulous traders. A sale cannot continue indefinitely, as curtain firm Roseby's discovered two years ago, when the director general of fair trading, John Bridgeman, ruled that the display of \"closing down sale\" signs in their shop windows - some for up to a year at a time, and with no stated closing date - was misleading. \"Using extended closing down sales to entice consumers into a shop and spend money when there is no closing date in prospect is extremely misleading,\" said Bridgeman. \"Consumers should be able to shop in the confidence that they are getting genuine closing down offers.\" </p> <p>And they should, by extension, be able to shop in the confidence that a sale price is just that. With constant sales - spring, summer, late summer, autumn, winter, new year, vernal equinox, any excuse - it can be difficult to keep track of what the real price of merchandise ought to be. It also arouses suspicion among shoppers asked to pay the full price for an item. If a store can flog televisions with a saving of \u00a3200 for half the year, are their prices artificially inflated in the non-sale periods? </p> <p>It's this scepticism which has persuaded some of the larger chains to eschew one-off sales in favour of a permanent commitment to match competitors' prices. It's a policy that department store chain John Lewis has long held. \"A sale can mean all kinds of things,\" says spokesman Greg Williams. \"We call our events a clearance, because that's exactly what we do - we get the goods off the shelves at special terms to make room for the new. Any shop can say, 'we're good value' or have a July 2 sale. But we avoid the word sale because we should be beating our competitors all year round.\" And he believes the store's \"never knowingly undersold\" motto gives customers the confidence to shop without suspicion: \"They can be reassured that they're getting the best price. If you have a sale price, customers are going to wonder why you've not got that price the next day.\" </p> <p>Retailers cannot conjure sale prices out of thin air (although where they find the merchandise to stock the sale is another matter). According to the Consumer Protection Act 1987, the previous price, as well as the reduction, should be clearly marked. Moreover, \"the product must have been available to consumers at that price for at least 28 consecutive days in the previous six months\". If this is not the case, the retailer must display a notice to that effect. An item doesn't have to be on sale at its sale price for 28 days before being reduced again, but the code requires the store to mention all the intervening prices for the item. </p> <p>Higher prices don't have to be displayed, however, for \"special purchases\". These are what you see on sale day when you enter a favourite store to see the rails stacked with unfamiliar merchandise - goods that have been bought in just for the sale, and have never previously been sold there, at a reduced, or any other price. </p> <p>\"At Next, everything is genuine, this season's merchandise,\" explains spokesperson Christine Gerrard. \"People know it's the same quality, and the same value, but often half price. There's a low risk involved in buying at our sales.\" Next branches have sales promotions only twice a year - July and Christmas - and don't discount merchandise at any other time. Sales are scheduled to last 10-14 days, but often finish earlier as the mountain of stock disappears quickly. \"People often queue from 2am,\" says Gerrard. \"We have to draft in extra help just to limit the number of customers coming into the store.\" </p> <p>Next also flags its no-quibbles returns policy, even on sale goods. Many consumers are confused by the new signs that spring up in shops at discount time, warning that there are \"no refunds on sale goods.\"But this isn't the case, says the Consumers' Association, which points out that your statutory rights allow you to return any item that is faulty, no matter when you bought it. Retailers are within their rights, however, to refuse to give you your money back on a sale item bought in haste and resented at leisure - after all, the point of these sales is to prevent the stock clogging up the company warehouses. </p> <p>\"Your rights are exactly the same in the sales as at any other time,\" explain the Office of Fair Trading. Your statutory rights, which state that any items you buy must be of satisfactory quality, fit for their purpose and sold as described, remain the same, unless you buy goods that are clearly marked as faulty. </p> <p>The real difference, of course, is the consumer's attitude towards the sales - that almost manic enthusiasm that inspires the most dedicated to camp out overnight in the hope of snaring the ultimate bargain. If most of us are not so resolute, there can be few people who can honestly say that they have never been tempted by a \"50% off\" price tag and impulsively purchased an item which would forever remain at the back of the wardrobe. (Incidentally, beware those \"up to 50% off\" notices: only 10% of the goods have to be thus discounted.) </p> <p>Could our addiction to the sales be weakening? With many stores now making \"price promises\", offering your money back if you can find the same item cheaper elsewhere, and the internet opening up a new avenue for discounted goods, it's perfectly possible to track down a good deal at any time of year. According to the Consumers' Association, it's time to go back to basics: \"the best way to get a good deal is to shop around and simply buy from the store which offers the best price.\" </p> <p>As if the endless queues, the bruises from fellow shoppers with specially-sharpened elbows and the multi-paged credit card bill weren't proof enough, the speed with which retailers manage to clear out their unwanted stock simply by posting a sale banner is a clue to the fact that sales aren't just there for the penny-conscious shopper. They do, in addition, have the power to make us abandon the usual rules of buying goods, namely: is it any good? If it's a rip-off at full price, chances are that it won't be the bargain of a lifetime even with 50% off. After all, says Williams, \"there's a difference between cheapness and value.\"</p>",

England were knocked out in the second round.</p> <p>But Germany won by the narrowest margin possible - 12-11, after New Zealand's Charles Dempsey inexplicably decided to abstain in the last round, despite earlier promising South Africa his vote.</p> <p>Fifa president Sepp Blatter announced the verdict of his 24-man Fifa executive committee to a packed press conference at the Hallenstadion in Zurich. </p> <p>England's \u00a310m bid picked up only two votes in the second round after receiving five in the first. Their first-round support is understood to have come from Scotland's David Will as well as Charles Dempsey and the three Central American representatives. </p> <p>However, that Central American trio abandoned the English bid after the first round, in which Morocco were eliminated with just three votes.</p> <p>Campaign director Alec McGivan couldn't hide his disappointment after seeing England's bid fail. And he laid the blame for the defeat firmly at the feet of the rioting hooligans in Charleroi before last month's game with Germany in Euro 2000. </p> <p>\"I think our hopes of getting one or two European votes died the day the hooligans took to the streets of Charleroi,\" conceded McGivan. \"And if I'm honest I think that was an impossible position to recover from within the context of European opinion. </p> <p>\"We could have progressed if we'd got one or two votes and only one or two votes would have done the job for us from Europe. And right throughout this campaign we hoped that we could pick away at the German votes in Europe and achieve one or two for ourselves,\" he added. </p> <p>\"If we could have built on five or six votes from either the South Americans or one or two Europeans this result today could have been very, very different.\" </p> <p>The key to Germany's shock triumph was a last-ditch deal hatched with the four Asian representatives on the Fifa executive last night. Sensing that Asian discontent over a disagreement with Fifa president Sepp Blatter about voting rights on the executive committee was still lingering, the Germans exploited the advantage to its maximum. </p> <p>Both Germany and South Africa received 11 votes each in the second phase, which meant that South Africa need just one more vote to shift in their favour to host the tournament - because Blatter, who holds the casting vote in the event of a tie, was in favour of their bid. </p> <p>At that stage the South Africans were confident they would get at least one of the two remaining votes. </p> <p>\"I think, if we have counted right, the vote will come to us from Charles Dempsey. He had promised us that if England were eliminated before the final round, his vote would come to South Africa,\" said Emmanuel Maradas, one of the South African bidding team. </p> <p>However, the Germans managed to nose ahead at the last minute by persuading the Asian delegates to back their bid - and because of Dempsey's surprise abstention.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Germany will host the 2006 World Cup after coming from behind to shock massive favourites South Africa in the final round of voting. England were knocked out in the second round. But Germany won by the narrowest margin possible - 12-11, after New Zealand's Charles Dempsey inexplicably decided to abstain in the last round, despite earlier promising South Africa his vote. Fifa president Sepp Blatter announced the verdict of his 24-man Fifa executive committee to a packed press conference at the Hallenstadion in Zurich. England's \u00a310m bid picked up only two votes in the second round after receiving five in the first. Their first-round support is understood to have come from Scotland's David Will as well as Charles Dempsey and the three Central American representatives. However, that Central American trio abandoned the English bid after the first round, in which Morocco were eliminated with just three votes. Campaign director Alec McGivan couldn't hide his disappointment after seeing England's bid fail. And he laid the blame for the defeat firmly at the feet of the rioting hooligans in Charleroi before last month's game with Germany in Euro 2000. \"I think our hopes of getting one or two European votes died the day the hooligans took to the streets of Charleroi,\" conceded McGivan. \"And if I'm honest I think that was an impossible position to recover from within the context of European opinion. \"We could have progressed if we'd got one or two votes and only one or two votes would have done the job for us from Europe. And right throughout this campaign we hoped that we could pick away at the German votes in Europe and achieve one or two for ourselves,\" he added. \"If we could have built on five or six votes from either the South Americans or one or two Europeans this result today could have been very, very different.\" The key to Germany's shock triumph was a last-ditch deal hatched with the four Asian representatives on the Fifa executive last night. Sensing that Asian discontent over a disagreement with Fifa president Sepp Blatter about voting rights on the executive committee was still lingering, the Germans exploited the advantage to its maximum. Both Germany and South Africa received 11 votes each in the second phase, which meant that South Africa need just one more vote to shift in their favour to host the tournament - because Blatter, who holds the casting vote in the event of a tie, was in favour of their bid. At that stage the South Africans were confident they would get at least one of the two remaining votes. \"I think, if we have counted right, the vote will come to us from Charles Dempsey. He had promised us that if England were eliminated before the final round, his vote would come to South Africa,\" said Emmanuel Maradas, one of the South African bidding team. However, the Germans managed to nose ahead at the last minute by persuading the Asian delegates to back their bid - and because of Dempsey's surprise abstention.",

Then we played some pool.\" </p> <p>His opponent, the movie's hero, was also one of the film's producers. Cruise, who starred opposite Paul Newman as a pool-shooting ace in The Colour of Money, could hand Scott the biggest role of his career. So what did Scott do? \"First game I wiped the table. Then I thought, 'What did I do that for? My competitive spirit has just lost me a job.' \" Woo and Cruise exchanged wry glances as Tom racked up the balls for another game. \"He is good, though,\" Scott continues. \"I just got lucky. He beat me in the second game.\" </p> <p>By the time Scott got back to his hotel room that evening, Woo and Cruise had offered him the role of Sean Ambrose, the lapsed member of the Impossible Missions Force who ruins Cruise's rock climbing holiday and generally makes his life hell. It was a huge break for Scott, best known in Britain for the TV series Soldier, Soldier. </p> <p>From the outset, Scott's relationship with his co-star was a balancing act: they would be spending a great deal of time together, yet their characters had to hate each other's guts. The two roles mirror each other, from the first scene, when \"Cruise\" rips off his mask to reveal himself as none other than his arch-enemy. For pretty much the rest of the film, anything good guy Cruise does, bad guy Scott does, even down to getting the girl. </p> <p>\"He's a lovely man. He's still very humble and you can feel very comfortable with him,\" says Scott, who clearly doesn't believe in biting the hand that feeds him. \"So that aspect of the relationship was good. But when we came to do all the fighting at the end, we naturally just kept our distance, tried to wind each other up so we got to that point of aggression where it's going to explode on screen.\" </p> <p>The requirement that they measure up to each other physically meant Scott was trying to catch up with the perpetually buff Cruise before they'd even started shooting. \"I was training for nearly a year before the film because I was really slight at the time so I had to build up a lot of muscle.\" </p> <p>Cruise's insistence on doing his own stunts upped the ante, however, and Scott could not match his near-suicidal commitment, especially when it came to the rock climbing scenes, where Cruise dangles from a sheer rock face. \"You've got to take your hat off to him and say: 'The guy's a madman, but let's admire him.' He gets a thrill out of that stuff. He's an adrenaline junkie.\" </p> <p>Ironically, it was Scott who came closest to really hurting himself, when he fell off his motorbike. \"It was one of the easiest shots: I was coming round a corner and I just had to stop the bike. But the seventh time I did it there was some gravel on the road and the front wheel just skidded. I rolled off into the curb and hurt my shoulder, but I stood up. Panicky faces all around me, I tell you, but we didn't lose any time.\" </p> <p>This injury was one of the reasons cited in the press for the film's prolonged shooting time - nine months. Scott puts it down to bad weather and Woo's impenetrable technique. It was impossible to judge from the script how long it would take, he says. For the climactic half-hour action scene, the script merely said: \"Ethan and Ambrose chase each other on motorbikes.\" Then: \"They fight.\" \"No one understood how it was going to look - even very experienced technical people would just shake their heads. I queried John once on how something was going to work and he said, 'Ah! I used to be an editor, you know. Get back on set!' \" </p> <p>The overrun cost Scott the part of Wolverine in Bryan Singer's forthcoming comic book adaptation, X-Men. So his next role exercised his brain rather than his body: a cryptographer in Michael Apted's adaptation of Robert Harris's wartime novel, Enigma. Scott shed the pounds he'd gained for M:i-2, and instead of hours in the gym spent hours in the library, learning the basics of codebreaking. Scott is now waiting to see how Britain will take to M:i-2. It has already enjoyed massive success in the US, taking around $200m. Perhaps he will never be able to pass unrecognised again. </p> <p>He initially dismisses the notion. \"The most famous actors in Britain are people who do TV series. When I did Soldier, Soldier, people used to stop me all the time at airports and train stations. It was just embarrassing really.\" </p> <p>But he has just had his first brush with obsessive fans. Someone recently hand-delivered a letter to him asking for a signed photo, even though he had just moved house. And he had three stalkers in Australia, despite registering in hotels under a false name - phone calls from strangers asking him to come out and meet them, people chasing his car, faces that appeared in crowds again and again. This is one side of Cruise's lifestyle that he'd rather not share. \"Poor guy. His life's under scrutiny the entire time. I'm not aware of my status as a celebrity because I don't think I am one.\" </p> <p>M:i-2 opens tomorrow.</p>",

For the climactic half-hour action scene, the script merely said: \"Ethan and Ambrose chase each other on motorbikes.\" Then: \"They fight.\" \"No one understood how it was going to look - even very experienced technical people would just shake their heads. I queried John once on how something was going to work and he said, 'Ah! I used to be an editor, you know. Get back on set!' \" The overrun cost Scott the part of Wolverine in Bryan Singer's forthcoming comic book adaptation, X-Men. So his next role exercised his brain rather than his body: a cryptographer in Michael Apted's adaptation of Robert Harris's wartime novel, Enigma. Scott shed the pounds he'd gained for M:i-2, and instead of hours in the gym spent hours in the library, learning the basics of codebreaking. Scott is now waiting to see how Britain will take to M:i-2. It has already enjoyed massive success in the US, taking around $200m. Perhaps he will never be able to pass unrecognised again. He initially dismisses the notion. \"The most famous actors in Britain are people who do TV series. When I did Soldier, Soldier, people used to stop me all the time at airports and train stations. It was just embarrassing really.\" But he has just had his first brush with obsessive fans. Someone recently hand-delivered a letter to him asking for a signed photo, even though he had just moved house. And he had three stalkers in Australia, despite registering in hotels under a false name - phone calls from strangers asking him to come out and meet them, people chasing his car, faces that appeared in crowds again and again. This is one side of Cruise's lifestyle that he'd rather not share. \"Poor guy. His life's under scrutiny the entire time. I'm not aware of my status as a celebrity because I don't think I am one.\" M:i-2 opens tomorrow.",

The 1997 incident is currently under investigation by Nasa's Inspector General's office.\"",

In the latest effort to break the seven-week impasse, the a senior military official held more than four hours of talks with coup plotters. Neither side commented on the talks, the first to take place between the two sides since June 25, when a tentative agreement between rebels and the military rulers collapsed. Today's protests followed the military's decision to stop people entering the parliament complex from midnight tonight. Enforcement of the \"total exclusion\" zone has so far been lax but \"we could tighten it at any time in the 48-hour period,\" Major Howard Politini said. During that period, the hundreds of Speight supporters would be allowed to leave without arrest, he added. Mr Speight has warned that the hostages could be harmed if the military stops the until now fairly free access or cuts off utilities. \"It now appears that the military has grossly underestimated our support and they have, in their own stupidity, decided to call our bluff,\" rebel spokesman Jo Nata said. \"The military should take responsibility for any backlash that may result.\" Earlier, a two-hour sit-in by a couple of dozen villagers closed down the airport in Labasa, a town on the northern island of Vanua Levu that was the site of a brief military mutiny Tuesday. Commodore Frank Bainimarama, who assumed power 10 days after the coup, has been reluctant to take strong action provided no harm comes to any of the hostages, who include deposed prime minister Mahendra Chaudhry, the first Fijian of Indian ancestry to lead the country. Many in the military support the coup's stated objective of giving indigenous Fijians priority over ethnic Indians. 51% of the population is indigenous to Fiji and many resent the economic and political clout of ethnic Indians who make up 44 % of the population.

      "body": "<p>A fresh political row about elitism at Oxford university blew up yesterday, after the Labour chairman of the influential cross-party education committee was accused of trying to stifle debate about the individual case of schoolgirl Laura Spence.</p> <p>Nick St Aubyn, Conservative MP for Guildford, was repeatedly warned by the committee chairman, Barry Sheerman, not to ask questions involving \"individual cases\" as he tried to ask senior Oxford dons about controversial remarks made recently by chancellor Gordon Brown on the university's admissions procedures.</p> <p>But Mr St Aubyn persisted with his questioning amid furious exchanges in the Commons committee room, and later accused Mr Sheerman, Labour MP for Huddersfield, of breaking the sacred rule of independence in order to support Mr Brown.</p> <p>The case of Laura Spence, a comprehensive school pupil, attracted national attention earlier this year after she failed to win a place at Magdalen College, Oxford to study medicine despite her brilliant academic record.</p> <p>Gordon Brown was criticised for wading into the row, claiming during a speech that her rejection was \"scandalous\" and accusing Oxford of discriminating against state school pupils. The education committee, which had already launched an inquiry into higher education, then decided to extend it to examine how top universities choose their students.</p> <p>\"I had asked the chairman before the meeting started whether there were any forbidden areas and he said there were not,\" Mr St Aubyn said after the committee hearing yesterday.</p> <p>\"The idea that we should skirt around the incident which sparked this strand of our inquiry is frankly ludicrous. The way this was handled did great damage to the reputation of the committee and to the standing of our chairman\".</p> <p>He stressed that Mr Sheerman's first duty was to be \"a non-partisan chairman rather than a member of the Labour party who supports Gordon Brown\".</p> <p>Questioned earlier about the impact of Mr Brown's comments, Oxford's vice-chancellor, Dr Colin Lucas, hinted that the chancellor had not had the full facts about the case of Laura Spence. \"Whatever remarks were offered were offered on the basis of incomplete information,\" he told MPs.</p> <p>He said he had had no contact from anyone at the Treasury prior to Mr Brown's speech at TUC lunch. But Oxford was worried about the \"international resonance\" of such opinions, which could affect its ability to attract the best students from around the world.</p> <p>Dr Lucas said the university needed at least \u00a31m from the government to implement a raft of new \"access\" initiatives to attract more applications from state school pupils. But the biggest single obstacle was still \"the attitude of pupils from state schools and the schools themselves who believe that Oxford isn't right for their pupils\", he insisted.</p> <p>He was satisfied that admissions tutors could see through the \"gloss\" of those private school pupils who were specially coached for interviews.</p> <p>\"When you set about choosing somebody to teach, you don't really want a quick-tongued smart alec, you want somebody interesting and exciting to teach and who has great potential,\" he told MPs.</p> <p>Oxford was piloting new tests developed by John Stein, professor of physiology at Magdalen College, to try and assess students' potential, he said.</p> <p>Dr Lucas rejected MPs' suggestions that prospective youngsters should be targeted much earlier about applying to the university, possibly as young as 13 or 14, saying it would be too cost and labour-intensive.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A fresh political row about elitism at Oxford university blew up yesterday, after the Labour chairman of the influential cross-party education committee was accused of trying to stifle debate about the individual case of schoolgirl Laura Spence. Nick St Aubyn, Conservative MP for Guildford, was repeatedly warned by the committee chairman, Barry Sheerman, not to ask questions involving \"individual cases\" as he tried to ask senior Oxford dons about controversial remarks made recently by chancellor Gordon Brown on the university's admissions procedures. But Mr St Aubyn persisted with his questioning amid furious exchanges in the Commons committee room, and later accused Mr Sheerman, Labour MP for Huddersfield, of breaking the sacred rule of independence in order to support Mr Brown. The case of Laura Spence, a comprehensive school pupil, attracted national attention earlier this year after she failed to win a place at Magdalen College, Oxford to study medicine despite her brilliant academic record. Gordon Brown was criticised for wading into the row, claiming during a speech that her rejection was \"scandalous\" and accusing Oxford of discriminating against state school pupils. The education committee, which had already launched an inquiry into higher education, then decided to extend it to examine how top universities choose their students. \"I had asked the chairman before the meeting started whether there were any forbidden areas and he said there were not,\" Mr St Aubyn said after the committee hearing yesterday. \"The idea that we should skirt around the incident which sparked this strand of our inquiry is frankly ludicrous. The way this was handled did great damage to the reputation of the committee and to the standing of our chairman\". He stressed that Mr Sheerman's first duty was to be \"a non-partisan chairman rather than a member of the Labour party who supports Gordon Brown\". Questioned earlier about the impact of Mr Brown's comments, Oxford's vice-chancellor, Dr Colin Lucas, hinted that the chancellor had not had the full facts about the case of Laura Spence. \"Whatever remarks were offered were offered on the basis of incomplete information,\" he told MPs. He said he had had no contact from anyone at the Treasury prior to Mr Brown's speech at TUC lunch. But Oxford was worried about the \"international resonance\" of such opinions, which could affect its ability to attract the best students from around the world. Dr Lucas said the university needed at least \u00a31m from the government to implement a raft of new \"access\" initiatives to attract more applications from state school pupils. But the biggest single obstacle was still \"the attitude of pupils from state schools and the schools themselves who believe that Oxford isn't right for their pupils\", he insisted. He was satisfied that admissions tutors could see through the \"gloss\" of those private school pupils who were specially coached for interviews. \"When you set about choosing somebody to teach, you don't really want a quick-tongued smart alec, you want somebody interesting and exciting to teach and who has great potential,\" he told MPs. Oxford was piloting new tests developed by John Stein, professor of physiology at Magdalen College, to try and assess students' potential, he said. Dr Lucas rejected MPs' suggestions that prospective youngsters should be targeted much earlier about applying to the university, possibly as young as 13 or 14, saying it would be too cost and labour-intensive.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Who was the last cricketer to achieve the double of 1000 runs and 100 wickets in an English season? </strong> asks Fiona Duxbury </p> <p>Since the number of County Championship matches started being reduced in 1968 it has become more and more difficult to play enough games to complete the allrounder's double, which was once quite commonplace. New Zealand's Richard Hadlee achieved the feat for Nottinghamshire in 1984, the first time anyone had managed it since Surrey's Stewart Storey in 1967. But the last man to do it was another Notts player, the Barbadian Franklyn Stephenson, in 1988. By the time of the last match of the season, against Yorkshire at Trent Bridge, he had 114 wickets (many of them with his speciality, a looping slower ball or donkey-drop), but was still 210 runs short - a bit of a problem, as he'd never scored a hundred for Notts. Stephenson rectified that with 111 in the first innings and 117 in the second - and took 11 wickets in the match for good measure. </p> <p> <strong>When did Jonathan Agnew begin his commentating career? </strong> asks Chris Robinson</p> <p>We weren't sure, so we asked Aggers: \"I was a summariser on BBC Radio's 'Test Match Special' throughout the England-West Indies series of 1991. And I made my debut as a ball-by-ball commentator at the end of that year, in the one-off Test against Sri Lanka at Lord's.\" Agnew, now 40, was a fast bowler in his younger days. He played for Leicestershire from 1978 to 1990, and won four England caps in the 1980s. After injuries to other bowlers he came out of retirement to play in a one-day semi-final for Leicestershire in 1992. Unlike many players-turned-commentators, he served his apprenticeship in the media by spending his winters working in the trade, for BBC Radio Leicester. </p> <p> <strong>Is it true that Majid Khan of Pakistan once hit a bowler for five sixes in an over? </strong> asks Ilyas Choudry</p> <p>Majid Khan - or Majid Jahangir as he was known then - was touring England with Pakistan in 1967 when he smashed 147 not out in 89 minutes against Glamorgan at Swansea. His innings included 10 fours and 13 sixes, five of them in one over (606666) from offspinner Roger Davis. Majid didn't do much in that year's Tests, but Glamorgan obviously liked the look of him - they signed him up as their overseas player the following year, and he stayed until 1976. He blossomed later in his Test career and finished with 3931 runs from 63 matches. Until recently he was chief executive of the Pakistan Cricket Board. He is the cousin of Imran Khan - but it is said that they haven't spoken since 1982 when Imran, in his first series as captain, decided to drop Majid from the Test side in England. </p> <p> <strong>Could you please settle an argument for me? I say that the fastest bowler in the world has been clocked at above 100mph. Is this true?

That was in a special net - but Thommo still maintains he wasn't trying that hard! In recent years the radar-gun \"Speedster\" has become a familiar sight at international matches, and the highest speed recorded in a match has been 96mph, by Shoaib Akhtar of Pakistan and Australia's Brett Lee. </p> <p> <strong>In that amazing Test against West Indies at Lord's, at least part of all four innings took place on the Friday.

For the first season (1977-78), 41-year-old Bobby Simpson came out of a ten-year retirement to captain the official Australian team. He did well against India at home - he scored two centuries and Australia won 3-2 - and unsurprisingly struggled a bit in West Indies, losing 3-1. The following season Simpson could not agree terms with the Australian Board, and he retired again. Graham Yallop took over, but suffered a record 5-1 defeat to England, and was replaced before the end of the 1978-79 season by Kim Hughes. Hughes led Australia in the 1979 World Cup and in India in 1979-80, but then peace broke out, the Packer players returned, and Greg Chappell resumed as captain. </p> <p> <strong>I have been asked to speak on the subject of cricket at Old Trafford, and even though as a schoolboy I watched Jim Laker taking his 19 wickets there, I can never remember the names of the two \"ends\". What are they called? </strong> asks John Cowan</p> <p>The one at the city end at Old Trafford is called the Warwick Road end, after the road that runs by the main entrance. The other one is called the Stretford end, after the nearby suburb. Laker took all of his record haul of 19 wickets in that 1956 Test against Australia from the Stretford end. </p> <p> <strong>Who were Australia's wicketkeepers between Wally Grout's retirement and Rodney Marsh's debut? </strong> asks Sankar Chatterjee</p> <p>Grout retired after the 1965-66 Ashes series. Three years later, aged only 41, he died of a heart attack. His immediate replacement was Brian Taber, a small, neat keeper from New South Wales, who went on Australia's 1966-67 tour of South Africa, with WA's Gordon Becker as his understudy. Taber made five dismissals on debut (at Johannesburg), and finished with 19 in the series. But he didn't score many runs, and for the following season's home series against India Australia went back to Barry Jarman, Grout's long-term understudy. The chunky Jarman was Bill Lawry's vice-captain in England in 1968, but retired after the 1968-69 home series against West Indies. Taber regained the gloves for the tours of India and South Africa in 1969-70, then Marsh made his debut against England in 1970-71. It was a controversial choice at the time, as Marsh's wicketkeeping wasn't very polished, and he picked up the mocking nickname \"Iron Gloves\". Taber finished with 60 dismissals from 16 Tests and later became a coach. Jarman, who is now an ICC referee, had 54 from 19. And Marsh improved dramatically after that unpromising start and topped everyone, until Ian Healy came along, with 355 dismissals from 96 Tests. </p> <p><em>Steven Lynch is managing editor of Wisden Cricket Monthly</em></p> <p>We regret that not all questions can be answered and that personal correspondence can only sometimes be entered into</p>",

Graham Yallop took over, but suffered a record 5-1 defeat to England, and was replaced before the end of the 1978-79 season by Kim Hughes. Hughes led Australia in the 1979 World Cup and in India in 1979-80, but then peace broke out, the Packer players returned, and Greg Chappell resumed as captain. I have been asked to speak on the subject of cricket at Old Trafford, and even though as a schoolboy I watched Jim Laker taking his 19 wickets there, I can never remember the names of the two \"ends\". What are they called? asks John Cowan The one at the city end at Old Trafford is called the Warwick Road end, after the road that runs by the main entrance. The other one is called the Stretford end, after the nearby suburb. Laker took all of his record haul of 19 wickets in that 1956 Test against Australia from the Stretford end. Who were Australia's wicketkeepers between Wally Grout's retirement and Rodney Marsh's debut? asks Sankar Chatterjee Grout retired after the 1965-66 Ashes series. Three years later, aged only 41, he died of a heart attack. His immediate replacement was Brian Taber, a small, neat keeper from New South Wales, who went on Australia's 1966-67 tour of South Africa, with WA's Gordon Becker as his understudy. Taber made five dismissals on debut (at Johannesburg), and finished with 19 in the series. But he didn't score many runs, and for the following season's home series against India Australia went back to Barry Jarman, Grout's long-term understudy. The chunky Jarman was Bill Lawry's vice-captain in England in 1968, but retired after the 1968-69 home series against West Indies. Taber regained the gloves for the tours of India and South Africa in 1969-70, then Marsh made his debut against England in 1970-71. It was a controversial choice at the time, as Marsh's wicketkeeping wasn't very polished, and he picked up the mocking nickname \"Iron Gloves\". Taber finished with 60 dismissals from 16 Tests and later became a coach. Jarman, who is now an ICC referee, had 54 from 19. And Marsh improved dramatically after that unpromising start and topped everyone, until Ian Healy came along, with 355 dismissals from 96 Tests.

Clips of the eight-year-old are to be released by her mother Sara in the desperate hope of new clues to her whereabouts. Mrs Payne is convinced her daughter is still alive. Sarah was last seen heading towards her grandparents' house in Littlehampton, West Sussex. Sussex police have released two men who had been held in connection with the missing girl. But they said the move made \"no difference\" to the progress of the investigation or the intensity of the search. One of the men later released from custody, a man in his 40s from Littlehampton, took part in an identity parade with Sarah's distraught elder brother, Lee, 13. He has told police he saw a white van and a grey Ford Mondeo shortly before Sarah vanished. Detectives are also investigating reports from another eight-year-old that she was chased by a man just four hours before Sarah went missing in the same area. Police may stage a reconstruction of Sarah's last-known movements and have enlisted the help of a crime profiler from the National Crime Faculty. However police are scaling back the blanket search for Sarah to focus on specific leads. \"This makes no difference to the way the investigation is going in terms of direction and strategy,\" Assistant Chief Constable Nigel Yeo told reporters. \"The desire to find Sarah is every bit as great as it was at any stage of the operation.\"",

      "body": "<p>Only the British would turn a big success story - the way foreign investment is pouring into the country - into an imminent tragedy. Earlier this week, Andrew Fraser, head of the Invest in Britain Bureau in the Department of Trade and Industry, warned of the prospect of a \"manufacturing meltdown\" if Britain did not join the euro. Yet the widely leaked IIB figures published yesterday confirm that last year saw a record number of jobs, projects and investment created by foreign money in the UK. Only 4% of the total came from Japan, which has been making the loudest noises about withdrawing, while 49% comes from America, which has not uttered a peep.</p> <p>If membership of the euro were the only issue, this would be an odd time to be withdrawing. After all, whatever arguments there might be about meeting the convergence criteria, eventual membership of the euro is much more likely now than it was during the deeply euro-sceptic Conservative years - when investment was flooding in. Any overseas company has known for years that Britain is unlikely to rush into another fixed currency system after the debacle of the ERM. Companies realise that there is, say, an 80% chance of Britain joining the euro during the next parliament if Labour wins and a zero chance if William Hague does. Gordon Brown reaffirmed yesterday that \"in principle\" he sees benefits from the euro as long as the economic tests he has laid down are \"rigorously\" assessed.</p> <p>The real worry for companies is not future uncertainty about the euro but current fears about the overvaluation of the pound and the devastating effect it is having on large swathes of industry. The two are linked in businessmen's minds because of the presumption, not shared by our EU partners, that entry into the euro would be accompanied by a steep downward realignment of sterling. The government has been ambivalent. Both prime minister and chancellor make occasional references to the currency being too strong, but do nothing about it. And neither has come out with a ball park figure at which sterling might join the euro should the conditions be met. If they did, and backed it with international support for intervention in the foreign exchange markets, then foreign investors would have to factor that into their assessments of the pound's worth.</p> <p>Mr Brown and Mr Blair both hope that questions about membership of the euro can be swept under the carpet until after the election. They hope that whenever the question is raised by the Conservatives they can smother it by saying that it will be decided by the British people in a referendum, in accordance with Labour policy. That may sound logical, but elections are not about logic: they are about street fighting. And the Conservatives, aided by the tabloid press, will keep asking the prime minister for a definitive declaration that he will not \"ditch the pound\". Meanwhile, Britain may lose some inward investment in the future partly because it is difficult to keep on winning the lion's share forever. Some Japanese firms which have been threatening to reduce investment - like Nissan, in which Renault of France now has a big stake - may have another agenda. For others the overvaluation of the yen against the euro ought to be a bigger worry. Overseas companies are attracted to the UK because it is a base for exporting to the EU with a business-friendly, low-tax environment, and speaks English. If these factors hold there is only one other thing that the government need worry about: getting the pound back to a realistic level.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Only the British would turn a big success story - the way foreign investment is pouring into the country - into an imminent tragedy. Earlier this week, Andrew Fraser, head of the Invest in Britain Bureau in the Department of Trade and Industry, warned of the prospect of a \"manufacturing meltdown\" if Britain did not join the euro. Yet the widely leaked IIB figures published yesterday confirm that last year saw a record number of jobs, projects and investment created by foreign money in the UK. Only 4% of the total came from Japan, which has been making the loudest noises about withdrawing, while 49% comes from America, which has not uttered a peep. If membership of the euro were the only issue, this would be an odd time to be withdrawing. After all, whatever arguments there might be about meeting the convergence criteria, eventual membership of the euro is much more likely now than it was during the deeply euro-sceptic Conservative years - when investment was flooding in. Any overseas company has known for years that Britain is unlikely to rush into another fixed currency system after the debacle of the ERM. Companies realise that there is, say, an 80% chance of Britain joining the euro during the next parliament if Labour wins and a zero chance if William Hague does. Gordon Brown reaffirmed yesterday that \"in principle\" he sees benefits from the euro as long as the economic tests he has laid down are \"rigorously\" assessed. The real worry for companies is not future uncertainty about the euro but current fears about the overvaluation of the pound and the devastating effect it is having on large swathes of industry. The two are linked in businessmen's minds because of the presumption, not shared by our EU partners, that entry into the euro would be accompanied by a steep downward realignment of sterling. The government has been ambivalent. Both prime minister and chancellor make occasional references to the currency being too strong, but do nothing about it. And neither has come out with a ball park figure at which sterling might join the euro should the conditions be met. If they did, and backed it with international support for intervention in the foreign exchange markets, then foreign investors would have to factor that into their assessments of the pound's worth. Mr Brown and Mr Blair both hope that questions about membership of the euro can be swept under the carpet until after the election. They hope that whenever the question is raised by the Conservatives they can smother it by saying that it will be decided by the British people in a referendum, in accordance with Labour policy. That may sound logical, but elections are not about logic: they are about street fighting. And the Conservatives, aided by the tabloid press, will keep asking the prime minister for a definitive declaration that he will not \"ditch the pound\". Meanwhile, Britain may lose some inward investment in the future partly because it is difficult to keep on winning the lion's share forever. Some Japanese firms which have been threatening to reduce investment - like Nissan, in which Renault of France now has a big stake - may have another agenda. For others the overvaluation of the yen against the euro ought to be a bigger worry. Overseas companies are attracted to the UK because it is a base for exporting to the EU with a business-friendly, low-tax environment, and speaks English. If these factors hold there is only one other thing that the government need worry about: getting the pound back to a realistic level.",

But the violence of the last few days at Drumcree has been particularly shocking: early yesterday morning water cannon was used against protestors for the first time in 30 years. In Belfast, shots were fired at the Royal Ulster Constabulary in a loyalist neighbourhood, prompting the police to fire back. Later a vast steel wall of concrete-filled containers was erected at Drumcree bridge, blocking the route of Orangemen who want to march down the mainly Catholic Garvaghy Road on Sunday. Violence, tension and sectarianism are all back in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>To the naked eye, this might look like a civil liberties demonstration about the Orange Order's fundamental right to march on what they still call \"the Queen's highway\". But few are convinced by that.

      "bodyText": "It is always depressing when Northern Ireland appears to descend back into its bloody past. But the violence of the last few days at Drumcree has been particularly shocking: early yesterday morning water cannon was used against protestors for the first time in 30 years. In Belfast, shots were fired at the Royal Ulster Constabulary in a loyalist neighbourhood, prompting the police to fire back. Later a vast steel wall of concrete-filled containers was erected at Drumcree bridge, blocking the route of Orangemen who want to march down the mainly Catholic Garvaghy Road on Sunday. Violence, tension and sectarianism are all back in Northern Ireland. To the naked eye, this might look like a civil liberties demonstration about the Orange Order's fundamental right to march on what they still call \"the Queen's highway\". But few are convinced by that. Candid unionists admit that the Orangemen could actually get their march if they really wanted it: by sending an official delegation to speak with the Parades Commission, which makes these decisions. They have so far declined to do so, preferring the purity of boycott over the compromise of dialogue. So this is not about winning the right to stage a march. Instead, this is yet another skirmish in the rejectionists' war against the Good Friday Agreement in general and David Trimble's acceptance of it in particular.

      "bodyText": "Within hours of agreeing to take part in a last-chance summit in the US to make peace with the Palestinians, the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, was stung by the enemy within when two hawkish parties gave notice last night of their intention to quit his coalition. The threatened defection of parties representing Russian immigrants and Jewish settlers in the West Bank came o after President Bill Clinton put his legacy as the Middle East peacemaker on the line by inviting Mr Barak and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, to a summit at Camp David. Even before the threatened revolt - which could reduce Mr Barak's coalition to a minority government - next Tuesday's summit was a highly risky proposition. Apart from Mr Barak's constant scramble to keep his unmanageable coalition intact, Mr Clinton is well past his political prime, and Mr Arafat presides over a cauldron of popular resentment. But Mr Clinton said yesterday that a summit was the only option left if Israel and the Palestinians were to sketch out an agreement before the September 13 deadline, now just 10 weeks away. \"While Israeli and Palestinian negotiators have made real progress, crystallising issues and defining gaps, the truth is they can take the talks no further at their level,\" Mr Clinton said. \"The negotiators have reached an impasse. Movement now depends on historic decisions that only the two leaders can make.\" After just a year in office, Mr Barak, Israel's most decorated soldier, has never looked less like a warrior, and it seems increasingly unlikely that he can take those brave steps towards peace. Already hostage to the whims of one coalition partner - Shas, which combined Oriental Jewish ethnic pride with ultra-Orthodoxy - Mr Barak's coalition would be reduced by the threatened defection to 59 seats in the 120-seat Knesset. Under Israeli law, last night's resignations come with a 48-hour grace period, which means Mr Barak can still try to hang on to his government. But he is clearly in a bind. The rightwing members of his broad and unwieldy coalition are balking at the prospect of returning large portions of the West Bank to the Palestinians and the other compromises that may emerge at the summit. Mr Barak and Mr Clinton also know that unless Israel agrees to deep concessions on territory, the future status of Jerusalem, and the rights of Palestinian refugees, it cannot even dare to hope of reaching an agreement that will be acceptable to Mr Arafat. That means Mr Clinton could face a very public failure at Camp David. But the risk of not holding a summit is even greater. In re cent days, Israeli security officials have been warning about an explosion of violence in the West Bank and Gaza as frustrations with Mr Arafat's regime - and the barely tangible returns of the peace process - boil over. There is also potential for confrontation in Mr Arafat's intention to declare an independent state some time after September 13, since Israel threatens to respond by annexing territory in the West Bank. The former Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky told a rally in Jerusalem last night that he was quitting the government because he feared that Mr Barak would make dangerous compromises at the summit, and then be unable to sell them to the Israeli public. During a stopover in London yesterday, Mr Barak said he was undaunted by the increasingly noisy attacks from the right wing. \"Basically we are implementing exactly what we have taken upon ourselves during the election, and we are determined to push it forward if there is a possibility of having an agreement,\" he told Israel Radio. \"Even if I stay prime minister with only one quarter of the Knesset behind me, we will do it and put it to the people.\" Palestinians would argue that the peace process is in such a parlous state precisely because Mr Barak has lacked the will to move forward. During his first months, he focused almost entirely on making peace with Syria. Now that he is ready to talk, Mr Arafat's room for manoeuvre has drastically eroded.

The plane, which was on a flight from Amman to Damascus, landed safely back in Amman, despite the exchange of fire, airport officials said. They said the Royal Jordanian airbus had been hijacked 10 minutes after take-off by three men carrying Syrian passports. One of the hijackers threw a bomb at security officials who attempted to prevent him from going into the cockpit. Three passengers suffered shrapnel wounds. Captain Jihad Rashad, head of the civil aviation authority, said: \"One of the hijackers, carrying a pistol and a grenade, tried to go into the cockpit 10 minutes into the flight. \"When security men on board stopped him, he fired a shot and threw the grenade, which exploded wounding 15 passengers but causing little damage to the aircraft.\" A senior security official said the Syrian who was killed was in his mid-20s.

His anti-corruption purges have upset some members of the security establishment, and his estranged uncle Rifaat has been agitating against his succession from his homes in exile in Marbella and outside Paris. Jordanian airliners were also the target of Palestinian hijacking attempts in the 1970s and 1980s by factions opposed to the moderate stance of the late King Hussein.

It will also raise questions about Mr Cook's ethical foreign policy, which has been repeatedly undercut by British defence firms.</p> <p>Mr Cook put a block on arms sales and successfully led calls for Pakistan to be suspended from the Commonwealth after General Pervez Musharraf's coup last October.</p> <p>All 46 applications for export licences to Pakistan from British arms firms have been blocked since the coup. Now, supplies of naval and other equipment are to be resumed.</p> <p>But in a deal agreed between Mr Cook and other ministers, the export of small arms and ammunition, which could be used in the disputed Kashmir region or for internal repression, will still be blocked.</p> <p>Ending the ban will almost certainly be condemned by India, but will be welcomed as an important gesture by Pakistan, which has been heavily criticised internationally.</p> <p>India and Pakistan both have nuclear weapons and tensions have been high over Kashmir. Pakistan is widely believed to have been responsible for an incursion into the Kargil area of the territory last year.</p> <p>Mr Cook, in a parliamentary written answer, said: \"The government has considered the situation in Pakistan and the wider region since the coup before deciding on a number of licence applications.\"</p> <p>He said: \"We remain concerned about defence exports to Pakistan, in the light of the incursion at Kargil, the coup, the possibility of diversion to undesirable end-users and continued regional tensions.\"</p> <p>The decision contrasts with Mr Cook's tone at the European summit in Finland in October following the coup. Then he said: \"It is important to send a clear message that we deplore the overthrow of democracy\". He wanted \"a swift and orderly return to democracy and rule of law.\"</p> <p>The diluting of the ban has taken place despite a lack of movement by Gen Musharraf's government to set a date for a return to democracy. The government has also failed to tackle the Islamic terrorists operating within Pakistan's borders, who are among \"the undesirable end-users\" of Mr Cook's statement.</p> <p>Britain's change of view towards Pakistan stems from a belief that it should be engaged rather than isolated and that the country's previous governments, though democratic in name, were shambolic. The fear is that an alternative to Gen Musharraf could be a hardline Islamic government, more tension with India over Kashmir and the attendant threat of nuclear conflict.</p> <p>A Foreign Office source said yesterday's decision was not \"triggered\" by any one event but \"if you take a look at what was happening in Kargil last year, we have not seen a repetition, which is a fairly crucial indication of whether there has been renewed aggression.\"</p> <p>The move followed a battle between cabinet ministers earlier this year, revealed in internal memos leaked to The Guardian. Mr Cook at the time was fending off attempts by the defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, and the trade and industry secretary, Stephen Byers, to restore arms sales.</p> <p>Twenty applications will now be approved, and 26 denied. A Foreign Office spokesman said: \"Mr Cook is very happy with the decision.\"</p> <p>Although the embargo has been lifted, approval will only be given to exports regarded as the least contentious. These will include spare parts for ships, naval helicopters and naval planes. The Foreign Office believes these would have no role in Kashmir. Approval will also be given to supply bomb disposal equipment and goods for civilian end-users.</p>",

Ending the ban will almost certainly be condemned by India, but will be welcomed as an important gesture by Pakistan, which has been heavily criticised internationally. India and Pakistan both have nuclear weapons and tensions have been high over Kashmir. Pakistan is widely believed to have been responsible for an incursion into the Kargil area of the territory last year. Mr Cook, in a parliamentary written answer, said: \"The government has considered the situation in Pakistan and the wider region since the coup before deciding on a number of licence applications.\" He said: \"We remain concerned about defence exports to Pakistan, in the light of the incursion at Kargil, the coup, the possibility of diversion to undesirable end-users and continued regional tensions.\" The decision contrasts with Mr Cook's tone at the European summit in Finland in October following the coup. Then he said: \"It is important to send a clear message that we deplore the overthrow of democracy\". He wanted \"a swift and orderly return to democracy and rule of law.\" The diluting of the ban has taken place despite a lack of movement by Gen Musharraf's government to set a date for a return to democracy. The government has also failed to tackle the Islamic terrorists operating within Pakistan's borders, who are among \"the undesirable end-users\" of Mr Cook's statement. Britain's change of view towards Pakistan stems from a belief that it should be engaged rather than isolated and that the country's previous governments, though democratic in name, were shambolic. The fear is that an alternative to Gen Musharraf could be a hardline Islamic government, more tension with India over Kashmir and the attendant threat of nuclear conflict. A Foreign Office source said yesterday's decision was not \"triggered\" by any one event but \"if you take a look at what was happening in Kargil last year, we have not seen a repetition, which is a fairly crucial indication of whether there has been renewed aggression.\" The move followed a battle between cabinet ministers earlier this year, revealed in internal memos leaked to The Guardian. Mr Cook at the time was fending off attempts by the defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, and the trade and industry secretary, Stephen Byers, to restore arms sales. Twenty applications will now be approved, and 26 denied. A Foreign Office spokesman said: \"Mr Cook is very happy with the decision.\" Although the embargo has been lifted, approval will only be given to exports regarded as the least contentious. These will include spare parts for ships, naval helicopters and naval planes. The Foreign Office believes these would have no role in Kashmir. Approval will also be given to supply bomb disposal equipment and goods for civilian end-users.",

Researchers at University College London have for the first time observed what happens to the minds of the lovestruck and their findings may explain many of the symptoms of lovesickness - butterflies, euphoria, and craving. Professor Semir Zeki and postgraduate student Andreas Bartels sought out volunteers who were \"truly and madly\" in love.

The volunteers had their brains scanned as they looked at either a picture of their lover or a friend of the same sex. The scanner was able to pick out the most and least active areas of the brain by revealing levels of blood flow. The physical effects of love could be traced to specific regions of the brain which \"lit up\" when volunteers saw the image of their loved ones. Mr Bartels said: \"When you're very much in love, you have this butterfly feeling in your stomach. \"That might be due to the medial insula, which is a highly connected region with links to all the sensory areas of the brain.\" Also highly active was part of the anterior cingulate, which is known to respond to euphoria-inducing drugs. Two areas in the deeper and more primitive basal ganglia region of the brain were also markedly active.

I would call on people to stay clear of violence.\" Adair, nicknamed Mad Dog, is the most charismatic loyalist, the only figure capable of inspiring the devotion shown to Wright, who was 37 when he was shot dead by the Irish National Liberation Army at the Maze prison in December 1997. He can be charming and has a fine line in black humour. But he is a maverick, and there are some in his own ranks who want him dead. Adair left the Maze last September under the early release programme of the Good Friday agreement after serving five years of a 16-year sentence for directing terrorism. No one had ever been convicted of the offence, and many believe it was created to take Adair off the streets. Pat Lynch, prosecuting at his 1995 trial, said Adair, trapped because jokey conversations with RUC officers were secretly taped, was a sinister and manipulative terrorist. He was \"dedicated to his cause which was nakedly sectarian in its hatred of those it regarded as militant republican, among whom he lumped almost the entire Catholic population.\" His murderous activities meant he was at loggerheads with the IRA in nearby Ardoyne, and he was the target for the ill-fated Shankill Road bomb, which left nine Protestants and bomber Thomas Begley dead in October 1993, sparking tit-for-tat killing. One man who had recently bought his car was mistakenly shot dead by the IRA. Police sources say he clears \u00a31,500 a week from drugs, but he denies it. He sometimes bumps into his rival in the IRA in Ardoyne, and they goad each other about who will be killed first. The meetings are said to be almost good-humoured.",

This has two parts. In the first or AV part up to 550 MPs would be elected, as now, in single member constituencies. However, voters would no longer simply put an X against their preferred candidate; instead they would mark the candidates in order of preference. If no single candidate won 50% of the first preference votes in a constituency, the votes of the lower-placed candidates would be redistributed in accordance with their second and lower preferences until one candidate had half the votes.</p> <p>Meanwhile in the second or plus part, around 100 additional MPs would be elected from county-wide party lists. These seats would go to the parties that had most obviously failed to get their proportionate share in the first part of the election.</p> <p>This has led some Labour strategists to a simple conclusion. Why not implement the AV half of Lord Jenkins's proposal while leaving the plus half to gather dust? It would mean that all MPs would continue to be linked to an individual constituency. And it would ensure that every MP had the backing of at least half of their constituents. Peter Mandelson, who is close to Tony Blair, backed the idea in a speech last week.</p> <p>The logic behind this proposal is simple, if ruthless. At Westminster the Lib Dems are far more of a threat to the Tories than they are to Labour. There are just four seats where a Lib Dem lies second and less than 10% behind a Labour MP. But there are no fewer than 21 seats where they are breathing down the neck of the local Tory MP. If second preferences help to push some second-placed Lib Dems into first place, William Hague has more to lose than Tony Blair.</p> <p>And there seems to be a further advantage for Labour. Given the relatively good relations between Labour and the Lib Dems, it seems that Lib Dem voters would be more likely to give their second preferences to Labour than to the Tories. In other words, the system might even enable some second-placed Labour candidates to overtake a first place Tory too.</p> <p>The British election study confirms this assumption. At the time of the last election, two in three of those who voted Lib Dem said they would have given a second preference vote to Labour. Just one in five would back the Tories. The picture was very similar when this question was asked after last year's European elections.</p> <p>As a result, under AV Labour's 1997 landslide would have been even greater than it was. The party's majority might have been as much as 245 compared with the 179 it actually secured. The Lib Dems would have seen their representation nearly doubled while Mr Hague's motley band would have numbered fewer than 100. It is hardly a more proportional system, as Mr Mandelson claimed it would be, but it is certainly more satisfactory for both Labour and the Lib Dems.</p> <p>This analysis is dangerously short-sighted, however. Lib Dem voters may be well disposed toward Labour at the moment. But it has not always been so. From 1983 to 1992 more Lib Dem voters preferred the Tories to Labour. Indeed, in 1987 over a half of them preferred the Tories and just one in three backed Labour.</p> <p>AV would have done little harm to the Tories at those elections. In 1987 they may well have had an even bigger majority. In 1992, John Major would still have scraped back into Downing Street, albeit with a majority in single figures. Labour's woes would have been even worse.</p> <p>Some proponents of AV might take comfort from these figures. The system might give the Lib Dems more seats, but they would remain powerless when it comes to government. No third-party tail would be wagging the big party dog.</p> <p>Yet this is to ignore a vital feature of AV. A more proportional system might make Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy powerful after polling day, but AV would help make him a powerful figure before a single vote is cast. If the battle between Labour and the Tories looked at all close, the outcome might well appear to hinge on what Mr Kennedy recommended his potentially volatile voters to do with their second preference. Securing that endorsement is hardly likely to come for free.</p> <p>At the moment, Mr Kennedy appears surprisingly relaxed about Labour's PR debate. Little wonder. He might continue to back Lord Jenkins in public. But in private the Lib Dem spider has reason to savour the AV fly.</p> <p>John Curtice is deputy director of the ESRC Centre for Research into Elections and Social Trends.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:J.Curtice@strath.ac.uk\">J.Curtice@strath.ac.uk </a></p>",

The party's majority might have been as much as 245 compared with the 179 it actually secured. The Lib Dems would have seen their representation nearly doubled while Mr Hague's motley band would have numbered fewer than 100. It is hardly a more proportional system, as Mr Mandelson claimed it would be, but it is certainly more satisfactory for both Labour and the Lib Dems. This analysis is dangerously short-sighted, however. Lib Dem voters may be well disposed toward Labour at the moment. But it has not always been so. From 1983 to 1992 more Lib Dem voters preferred the Tories to Labour. Indeed, in 1987 over a half of them preferred the Tories and just one in three backed Labour. AV would have done little harm to the Tories at those elections. In 1987 they may well have had an even bigger majority. In 1992, John Major would still have scraped back into Downing Street, albeit with a majority in single figures. Labour's woes would have been even worse. Some proponents of AV might take comfort from these figures. The system might give the Lib Dems more seats, but they would remain powerless when it comes to government. No third-party tail would be wagging the big party dog. Yet this is to ignore a vital feature of AV. A more proportional system might make Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy powerful after polling day, but AV would help make him a powerful figure before a single vote is cast. If the battle between Labour and the Tories looked at all close, the outcome might well appear to hinge on what Mr Kennedy recommended his potentially volatile voters to do with their second preference. Securing that endorsement is hardly likely to come for free. At the moment, Mr Kennedy appears surprisingly relaxed about Labour's PR debate. Little wonder. He might continue to back Lord Jenkins in public. But in private the Lib Dem spider has reason to savour the AV fly.

      "bodyText": "Detectives hunting the missing schoolgirl Sarah Payne are investigating a claim that another eight-year-old girl was the target of an alleged abduction attempt just hours before her disappearance. Sussex police confirmed last night that a mother had come forward to say her daughter had been chased by a strange man just five hours before Sarah vanished from near her grandparents' home at 8pm on Saturday evening. The second child had been playing on her bike on a private estate in Littlehampton, West Sussex, three miles from Kingston, where Sarah was last seen. As police spent their third day hunting for Sarah, a spokesman said the second child had told her mother of the incident after hearing of the feared abduction of Sarah on television. \"A lady called us from the Beaumont Park estate in Littlehampton just after 5.30pm on Sunday to say she had just been told by her daughter that she was chased by a strange man.\" The spokesman denied reports that the man, who was described as bearded and with thinning brown hair, had been driving a white van similar to the one seen passing the cornfield where Sarah had been playing with her brothers and sister before she disappeared. As police spoke of their \"increasing concern\" for Sarah's safety, her teenage brother attended a police identity parade in an attempt to find the man detectives believe may have snatched her from the lane. Lee Payne - described as a \"bright sparky teenager\" by assistant chief constable Nigel Yeo - viewed a line-up at Brighton police station, including a man in his 40s, from Littlehampton, who had been held since Sunday evening before being released yesterday on police bail. It was hoped the 13-year-old would be able to clarify whether the man, whose white van is being forensically tested, was the person he saw driving in the lane at that time. Detectives had until midnight last night to continue questioning him. A second man, in his 30s, and believed to be from Crawley, West Sussex, who was arrested on Monday evening, was also released yesterday on police bail. As some 250 volunteers finished sifting through fields and copses in the area, officers focussed their attention on known sex offenders, and those with a criminal record. The Metropolitan police and other neighbouring forces have been drafted in as calls on the case have escalated to 800, and a psychological profile has been drawn up of the abductor. \"We've been getting assistance from other agencies, including a profile from the national crime service,\" said Mr Yeo. Meanwhile Sarah's parents said their other children, Lee, Luke, 11, and six-year-old Charlotte, were struggling under the strain of their sister's disappearance. \"They are getting worse and worse. They've never been apart this long, never,\" said Sara Payne. Clutching her husband Michael's hand, the 31-year-old barmaid added: \"Lee is very quiet.

Ms Solomon is claiming unfair and wrongful dismissal.</p> <p>Mr Keegan said Mr Lyons described John Chowcat, the former assistant general secretary, who called for an investigation, as someone \"who didn't know what he was doing\" and \" never did any work\". \"They're all dead and buried, that lot - Colin Adkins, Marcia Solomon, Chowcat - all of them. They're all on the way out. Finished,\" he told senior officials on his mobile phone, said Mr Keegan.</p> <p>He had been declared redundant two days after he said he obtained \u00a37,000 owed in overtime for driving Mr Lyons for up to 18 hours a day.</p> <p>He also disclosed he had been required to take Mr Lyons's daughter to work as a solicitor.</p> <p>Colin Adkins, an MSF research assistant, told the tribunal that he had been told by his line manager that he had been sent off to Caerphilly from head office for a year because he had taken up Ms Solomon's case. \"It was clear to me that the question of my employment future was being brought into question,\" he said.</p> <p>He was told by union officials that Ms Solomon was \"mad and insane\" for making the allegations. Mr Adkins said: \" It was well known that some senior officers had fairly extravagant expenses claims. There would often be an unjustified level of wining and dining, an over-reliance on using taxis instead of public transport, an over-reliance on using mobile telephones and a high level of unreceipted expense claims. \"</p> <p>He also said that regional managers of the union were quite differently treated from head office staff.</p> <p>\"They would not be allowed to incur expenses by using the hotel telephones to call home - they were to use public telephones. Officers had two thirds of their home telephone bills and the full cost of mobile telephone use paid by the union.\"</p> <p>Mr Chowcat - who was also a member of the ruling TUC council - broke a year's silence to reveal that the disclosures about Mr Lyons's hidden interest-free loans meant that the union had submitted inaccurate returns to the union's certification office and the Inland Revenue for its 1997 accounts.</p> <p>He also disclosed that Mr Lyons appeared to have broken the rules by not providing receipts for items under \u00a310 - since in 1995 the head of finance had insisted on receipts for all expenditure.</p> <p>The union's accountants, HW Fisher and Company, were also criticised by Bartholomew Madge, a chartered accountant, for not conducting a forensic inquiry into the allegations against Mr Lyons and Mr Mendes. He said they had failed to check bank accounts held by Mr Lyons and Mr Mendes.</p> <p>He said that there was \"an acute breakdown in normal accepted business practice\" for checking expenses receipts and there were serious weaknesses in the investigative methods.</p> <p>\"The MSF union cannot rely on the report to state that the allegations [about false accounts] are so manifestly false that they must therefore have been fabricated ...</p> <p>\"It therefore cannot be said, with confidence, that improper manipulation of funds in such accounts was not occurring.\"</p> <p>The hearing continues today.</p>",

Mr Keegan said Mr Lyons described John Chowcat, the former assistant general secretary, who called for an investigation, as someone \"who didn't know what he was doing\" and \" never did any work\". \"They're all dead and buried, that lot - Colin Adkins, Marcia Solomon, Chowcat - all of them. They're all on the way out. Finished,\" he told senior officials on his mobile phone, said Mr Keegan. He had been declared redundant two days after he said he obtained \u00a37,000 owed in overtime for driving Mr Lyons for up to 18 hours a day. He also disclosed he had been required to take Mr Lyons's daughter to work as a solicitor. Colin Adkins, an MSF research assistant, told the tribunal that he had been told by his line manager that he had been sent off to Caerphilly from head office for a year because he had taken up Ms Solomon's case. \"It was clear to me that the question of my employment future was being brought into question,\" he said. He was told by union officials that Ms Solomon was \"mad and insane\" for making the allegations. Mr Adkins said: \" It was well known that some senior officers had fairly extravagant expenses claims. There would often be an unjustified level of wining and dining, an over-reliance on using taxis instead of public transport, an over-reliance on using mobile telephones and a high level of unreceipted expense claims. \" He also said that regional managers of the union were quite differently treated from head office staff. \"They would not be allowed to incur expenses by using the hotel telephones to call home - they were to use public telephones. Officers had two thirds of their home telephone bills and the full cost of mobile telephone use paid by the union.\" Mr Chowcat - who was also a member of the ruling TUC council - broke a year's silence to reveal that the disclosures about Mr Lyons's hidden interest-free loans meant that the union had submitted inaccurate returns to the union's certification office and the Inland Revenue for its 1997 accounts. He also disclosed that Mr Lyons appeared to have broken the rules by not providing receipts for items under \u00a310 - since in 1995 the head of finance had insisted on receipts for all expenditure. The union's accountants, HW Fisher and Company, were also criticised by Bartholomew Madge, a chartered accountant, for not conducting a forensic inquiry into the allegations against Mr Lyons and Mr Mendes. He said they had failed to check bank accounts held by Mr Lyons and Mr Mendes. He said that there was \"an acute breakdown in normal accepted business practice\" for checking expenses receipts and there were serious weaknesses in the investigative methods. \"The MSF union cannot rely on the report to state that the allegations [about false accounts] are so manifestly false that they must therefore have been fabricated ... \"It therefore cannot be said, with confidence, that improper manipulation of funds in such accounts was not occurring.\" The hearing continues today.",

      "body": "<p>Louis Olivier Bancoult was four when he left his homeland, a coconut palm-covered island in the middle of the sparkling Indian Ocean. He was banished with the rest of the population of the Chagos archipelago, one of Britain's last colonial outposts. Dumped 1,200 miles away in Mauritius, Louis and his compatriots were left in abject poverty, without shelter, food or jobs. And they have been there now for more than 30 years, largely forgotten, an alienated community in exile.</p> <p>Today, however, the story of the Chagos islands, a ghost of our colonial past, has finally returned to haunt the British government.</p> <p>In the ramshackle district of Cassis, 10 minutes away from the polished modern buildings of the Mauritian capital, Port Louis, a historic legal challenge is being mounted. Here, the jobless shelter from the heat under a tree or sprawl on the pavement drinking beer. Louis Bancoult's own home is down a rough dirt path past corrugated shacks that overspill with children. It is an unlikely spot for any kind of legal action, but out in the backyard, seated amid roaming chickens, Creole-speaking Chagossians (known as the Ilois) are in discussion. Last year Bancoult, the community leader, was given leave to contest the ban that prevents his people from setting foot in the place they refer to as \"the motherland\". A judicial review is scheduled for July 17 at London's high court, and the Ilois are gearing themselves up for the next stage in their battle to go home.</p> <p>Many of the Ilois are elderly now, but they recall the circumstances of their expulsion. With Mauritius, the Chagos islands formed part of a British colony, but in the 60s, when Mauritius was negotiating independence, Britain struck a deal. Mauritius became independent in 1968 with \u00a33m in compensation. Meanwhile Britain retained sovereignty of the archipelago.</p> <p>The reason for the deal later became transparently clear. On a map of the Indian Ocean, the Chagos islands look like a cluster of dots, but their location, between the eastern coast of Africa, the Middle East and South West Asia, gave them enormous strategic significance. For western defence strategists, jittery about the Soviet empire, they were a gift. Britain leased the US the biggest island, Diego Garcia, allegedly in return for a discount on Polaris submarines.</p> <p>Today Diego Garcia houses a vital US military base. Complete with a 12,000ft runway and a natural harbour, it was used to launch B-52 bombers during the Gulf war and supported UN intervention in Somalia in 1992.</p> <p>The British government has always preferred to describe the Illois population, which in the 60s was spread across the British Indian Ocean Territory (which included Chagos), as \"migrant workers\". But the Ilois, many of whose families had been there since the early 19th century, having originally come from Mauritius, Madagascar, Mozambique and India to work on copra plantations, certainly liked to think of themselves as a proper, settled community: Diego Garcia boasted a school, a prison, a church and a cemetery. They regarded themselves as British subjects and Bancoult still holds a British passport, which gives his place of birth as the Chagos archipelago. But between 1967 and 1973, the Chagossians claim, they were tricked, bullied and cajoled into leaving the islands. In 1968 Bancoult's family sought medical treatment in Mauritius after a cart drove over his sister's foot. She died two months later and the family prepared to return. \"It was a big surprise when my parents registered their names - they were told by the officer that we could not because the land had been given to the US to make a military base,\" says Bancoult.</p> <p>\"I remember it as if it was today. My mother was crying because she was very sad about our beautiful country and our wonderful life. Her brother and her father were left in the Chagos and all our belongings. We had to stay in Mauritius, and face all the difficulties we still are facing.\"</p> <p>The people left behind on the islands had little idea of what was going on but supplies of essential provisions - rice, flour, sugar and oil - stopped. Then in 1971 a meeting was held on Diego Garcia. Lisette Talate, 59, was there. \"We were told by the residential manager of the Chagos that the Ilois must move to Mauritius to make way for the military base. The island had been sold in order to give independence to Mauritius. When we received the message we said that we did not want to leave, but we had no choice. Many people wanted to stay but all the provisions had been stopped and there were no doctors and nurses.\"</p> <p>At first, the islanders were told that they could stay on the island of Peros Banhos, 100 miles away, but in 1973 a ship arrived to take them to Mauritius, with promises of a new life. \"In Chagos they had been told they would have a house, a portion of land, animals and a sum of money,\" says Bancoult. \"But when they arrived nothing had been done.\" After refusing to disembark for several days, the Ilois were finally offered accommodation in the dockers flats. \"They were in very bad condition with no doors or windows, but they had no choice but to go and live there. Another place they had been offered had been used to keep animals. This is the treatment we have had in Mauritius.\"</p> <p>Adapting to life on Mauritius was difficult - they might as well have been abandoned on the streets of New York. The islanders were not used to living in a money economy having made a living from the sea and the coconut trees. They had no jobs, their skills were redundant, and they were forced to live in cramped, unsanitary conditions, with up to 20 people sleeping in one room.</p> <p>Compensation of \u00a3650,000 was paid by the Mauritian government, but not until 1978, when the promised sum had been eroded by inflation.</p> <p>\"Life was very difficult,\" says Rita Elysee, 74, Bancoult's mother. She found work as a domestic servant to feed her nine children. \"Sometimes I had to use old bread cooked with sugar to feed the family.\"</p> <p>As well as poverty, there was racism. \"The Mauritian people did not agree that we came to Mauritius and we have had bad treatment. When facing all these difficulties I became mad. I was thinking my life in Chagos was better than in Mauritius. Mauritius had become a hell for me.\"</p> <p>Life is still rough for the 8,000 Ilois living in Mauritius. The displaced community faces problems with alcohol, drugs, prostitution and suicide. Two of Bancoult's brothers died in their 30s, one an alcoholic, the other a drug addict. Illiteracy is common, as is unemployment. What little work there is tends to be loading lorries or domestic service.</p> <p>Extra compensation was paid to the Ilois in 1982, after the women went on hunger strike, but the agreement included a \"no return\" clause, which Bancoult says the illiterate Ilois did not understand.</p> <p>Rita David lives in a corrugated iron hut with a roof perforated with holes. In summer, when temperatures can reach 45C, it is an oven. In the rainy season, it offers little protection. Seventeen people sleep in the three-bedroomed house. With work irregular, David \"does\" for a local family to provide some sort of income. But it's a poor living.</p> <p>In the kitchen, Bancoult surveys the grimy, uneven floor and the two aged gas rings, which are all there is to cook on, and says: \"This is why I must have the courage to fight for my people.\"</p> <p>He knows he has a difficult fight ahead but it will be fuelled by his outrage. \"It was a great injustice that the UK government has done to its own people. We consider it is because we are black people, because we came from slaves.

Mr Straw also tried to reassure some of the 900 fans who the Belgian police admit were innocents caught up in events when they arrested them that they would not automatically face orders banning them from football matches for the next 10 years under his new legislation. The details of the bill, to be rushed through Parliament by the end of the month, are to be published tomorrow. But yesterday the Conservative party was already making clear that it wants to see the bill restricting the right to jury trial abandoned by ministers as the price of its cooperation to get the anti-hooligan measure on the statute book by the time of the next England game on September 2. Scottish opposition parties yesterday accused Mr Straw of making a glaring omission when it was realised that his proposal to prevent suspected hooligans travelling abroad will have no validity in Scottish law and in theory the whole package could be undermined by English hooligans travelling to away games from Scottish ports. But the Scottish executive said yesterday this was highly unlikely as the majority of cases could be handled by cooperation between Scottish and English police forces.

There's Ally's hair: once mousy and lank, but last night - being the first episode of a new series - bursting with follicular life: perky and wavy and prancing like a pony in a scented meadow. Even John noticed a change: \"Why are you so wet?\" he said, spitting the words out. There was an unrequited passion in his voice.

It's a wonder Nell can walk down a corridor without tripping over her freak-show mane. </p> <p>Is Ally McBeal a satire? Is all this cascading hair just a clever feminist joke about the bestial desires of men? No. It's just hair. And lots of it, to boot. </p> <p>Even John, the strange little man who talks to unicorns, seems to be growing his executive bouffant. His hair balloons as his libido declines. Ostensibly, because he's stopped having imaginary conversations with Barry White. \"I've lost him\", John confided to Elaine, the office gossip. John, it transpires, is the tastiest guy in the office, with or without the spritual assistance of Barry White. \"You're a hot little biscuit\", Elaine whispered, giving hope to small, unattractive men across the globe. </p> <p> <strong> Flatmates</strong> (C4), like Ally McBeal, examined the modern family, ie the family that isn't a family at all, but a group of people who have the misfortune to bump into each other each day at the photocopier or the student kitchen. </p> <p>Channel Four have based the show on a long-running Sky magazine feature, crossing it with their successful TV format, Streetmate. The show is understandably less racy than the Sky feature, which focuses on inter-household sex, usually in the shower. Instead, C4's show follows the process of choosing a new flatmate. </p> <p>The existing household grills each applicant, takes a Polaroid to remind itself what they look like, and then makes them all stand in the street while it decides who it hates the least. </p> <p>It's a most attractive TV idea (a carbon copy of the flatmate interview scene in Shallow Grave), high on cruelty. In episode one, a candidate is eliminated for being stupid... but only after she's made it to the final two. \"Who would you vote for?\" the flatmates ask her. \"Pro..ba..bly Conservative, because my parents do.\" </p> <p>No matter how many times one feels one's seen such a show, and such people, one can never have enough dirty washing. The show's only real drawback is the lack of a decent finale: making a garden bench from instructions does not make for the most riveting of showdowns. </p> <p>The winner, of course, was Shaun, the gag-a-minute gay guy. Two weeks after moving in, however, Shaun was starting to get on their nerves. The flatmates felt a bit guilty about not liking him, but Shaun had the ultimate let-out clause. He could always call them homophobic. </p> <p>The Bentalls, an old-fashioned family, came under the microscope for <strong> The Secret Life Of The Family</strong> (BBC1). Cameras on toothbrushes, inside trainers, and literally getting up everyone's noses. </p> <p>Janine, the mum, was an actress. I recognised her as \"the ugly woman\" in assorted BBC sitcoms. Except, as husband Paul pointed out, she wasn't ugly at all. She was uncommonly beautiful. A behavioural psychologist was on hand to play the modern Desmond Morris role. Continual testing of the family led to Janine being informed she was going through the menopause. \"As a result of our tests,\" the voice-over explained helpfully, \"Janine began hormone replacement therapy\". </p> <p>The Bentalls, it transpired, were not ordinary at all. They lived in an Elle Deco house with beautiful children and a big David Hockney swimming pool. I wasn't sure if this was a science programme or an aspirational lifestyle show. Maybe it was both - an HG Wellsian model of future living, complete with decking, spiky plants and a surveillence camera in every room. </p> <p>The most chilling fact of the programme was that a kitchen dishcloth carries more germs than a toilet seat.

In a move which will delight modernisers, but dismay traditionalists who like to drink through the night in Westminster's numerous bars, the business of the Commons is to be brought to an end by 10pm throughout the week. Labour backbenchers, who have been pressing for more \"family friendly\" hours, will warmly welcome the reform which is to be announced today by Margaret Beckett, the leader of the Commons. But Conservative MPs will criticise the end of late night sittings, saying that it will weaken the ability of the Opposition to hold the government to account.

His counsel, Michael Beloff QC, told the court of appeal that it should allow a judicial review of the home secretary's decision on May 6 last year to refuse the Egyptian-born businessman to go ahead because Jack Straw's decision had been biased and should be quashed. The home secretary refused to give Mr Fayed a British passport on the grounds that his payment of cash and benefits to MPs to ask questions and his role in the break-in to a bank safe deposit box belonging to his business rival, \"Tiny\" Rowland, meant he could not pass the necessary \"good character\" test to qualify for citizenship. But Mr Beloff repeated claims yesterday that an unsourced Sunday Express article on September 6 1998, which claimed Mr Straw had \"told friends\" that he could not see how Mr Fayed could have citizenship if he did pay MPs, meant that he had not approached the decision with \"an open mind\". He should have delegated the decision to another home office minister. Mr Straw has said he has no recollection of making such a remark. Mr Beloff argued that his role in the safe deposit box incident and the \"cash for questions\" affair should not have outweighed other factors such as Mr Fayed's employment of 3,000 people in Britain, that he paid his taxes in full, and faced \"compassionate circumstances\" at the time - the decision came not long after his son, Dodi, died in the car crash with Diana, Princess of Wales. He said the safe deposit box incident was \"one regrettable lapse\" and Mr Fayed had not broken into the box himself or asked others to do so but had failed to stop the \"actions of others\". As to the payment of cash and benefits to MPs, he said there was a \"risk of applying the standards of the 1990s to the events of the 1980s\". They were more a reflection on the bad character of the MPs who had accepted them rather than on Mr Fayed, who did not believe them to be unlawful. But Jonathan Crow, for the home secretary, said the appeal court application was nothing more than an attempt to appeal against the merits of a decision Mr Fayed did not like. The fact that he was a well-known individual and there had been considerable media interest did not affect Mr Straw's decision. The decision by the high court judge in October 1999, who ruled that Mr Straw had taken the right decision for the right reasons, should not be disturbed, Mr Crow said. Judgment was reserved.",

Timothy Donovan, 33, who is serving a life sentence at the west London prison, was punched in the face, grabbed by the neck and forced to the floor by one prison officer before others entered his cell and joined in beating him, Blackfriars crown court heard. The four prison officers, who cannot be named for legal reasons, all deny assaulting Donovan causing actual bodily harm on July 1 1998. Donovan, who was left with bruising to the ribs and a bloody nose, described how he tried to reach for his asthma inhaler because he was struggling to breathe, but was forced back on to the floor and held down. The prisoner had been housed in E wing since shortly after he was convicted of murder at Liverpool crown court in November 1996. Donovan yesterday told the court that prior to the alleged assault, he had been involved a dispute with defendant D over a rug removed from his cell during a search. He had been told by defendant D he could not keep the rug, a gift from his mother, because it was too big and contravened prison rules. Donovan had argued with defendant D before throwing the rug over a balcony in anger and returning to his cell, the court heard. Defendant D later returned the rug to his cell. Donovan said: \"He was more aggressive. He just said 'About the carpet', then dropped it and punched me on the nose with considerable force. \"My nose was bleeding. He grabbed my head and pushed me down towards the floor.\" Donovan said he was forced to the floor and then became aware of other officers coming in to his cell. \"I felt other punches to my ribs. I could feel them on my right hand side. They were hurting me.\" Earlier, the court heard that witnesses had seen an officer punch Donovan and another kick him. The prisoner told the officers he could not breathe and reached for his inhaler, but his arm was pushed down. He told the court he heard the voice of defendant A, a senior prison officer, say: \"Listen scumbag, I am the new officer on E wing and things are going to change.\" He was also told he would be disciplined for assaulting one of the staff, would get years added to his tariff, and would never get out of prison. Donovan was later treated by the prison doctor following the alleged assault, the jury heard. Earlier, Mark Heyward, prosecuting, told the court Donovan had not been aware of anyone else being around when defendant D entered his cell, but it appeared that the other prison officers were on the landing. Mr Heyward said: \"The purpose of the exercise that followed was to teach Donovan a lesson.\" He told the court: \"There together they joined in a physical assault on an inmate which involved punches and perhaps kicks. They are each responsible for the assault and together responsible for the assault.\" Donovan was later charged with assaulting defendant D and found guilty by the prison governor, who sentenced him to 14 days solitary confinement and reduced his privileges to a minimum.

      "body": "<p>I went palace-hunting this week, which is basically much like house-hunting, except that the quarry is bigger. Not for myself, you understand, but for the Queen, whom Mo Mowlam says ought to vacate Buckingham Palace in favour of something more modern. Some people, including her \"ardent monarchist\" boss, seem to think Mo was cruel, or worse still, republican, in wanting the Queen relocated. Yet Mo is a kindly soul, not the sort to favour eviction. Could it be that her real aim was not to offend the Queen, but to liberate her?</p> <p>She is, after all, in her mid-70s, and nearly 50 years into her reign. A large and famously boring building in London SW1 may not seem the most appropriate address at this stage in one's life. Look at it this way: where would she like to live? Happily, we know the answer. Long ago, in an uncharacteristically unguarded moment, she confided that the place where she'd most like to live is the Forest of Bowland in Lancashire.</p> <p>Accordingly, I went to the forest, some 400 square miles of moorland, fell, majestic river and bubbling stream east of Lancaster and north of the Preston-Blackburn-Burnley industrial belt. As monarch she is also Duke of Lancaster, so this is part of her Duchy to which she pays regular visits. One can certainly see the attraction. There is mile upon mile of enchantment. Try the drive east from Slaidburn to Lancaster along the Trough of Bowland - the valley which cleaves through the forest from east to west. The Yorkshire Dales, the Lake District (minus the lakes), the highlands of Scotland, wild Wales - there are echoes of all of them here, and it's wonderfully unravaged by time. I met only one tourist coach on Tuesday, though weekends are no doubt busier.</p> <p>There are not, it must be said, many properties which would serve unchanged as palaces. Stately homes are few. The Parker family have been at Browsholme Hall in the south-east for 500 years and may not yet be ready to quit. The Duke of Westminster has a place at Abbeystead on the wandering road to Lancaster but he too is no doubt keen to hang on to it. The Queen, they say, is a kindly soul and so not the sort to favour evictions.</p> <p>There are huge, remote, empty spaces here into which you could smuggle a marvellous 21st-century palace. Yet one would not wish to encourage promiscuous building in such a beautiful place. Better a brownfield site where an existing building could be adapted or an earlier one replaced.

      "bodyText": "I went palace-hunting this week, which is basically much like house-hunting, except that the quarry is bigger. Not for myself, you understand, but for the Queen, whom Mo Mowlam says ought to vacate Buckingham Palace in favour of something more modern. Some people, including her \"ardent monarchist\" boss, seem to think Mo was cruel, or worse still, republican, in wanting the Queen relocated. Yet Mo is a kindly soul, not the sort to favour eviction. Could it be that her real aim was not to offend the Queen, but to liberate her? She is, after all, in her mid-70s, and nearly 50 years into her reign. A large and famously boring building in London SW1 may not seem the most appropriate address at this stage in one's life. Look at it this way: where would she like to live? Happily, we know the answer. Long ago, in an uncharacteristically unguarded moment, she confided that the place where she'd most like to live is the Forest of Bowland in Lancashire. Accordingly, I went to the forest, some 400 square miles of moorland, fell, majestic river and bubbling stream east of Lancaster and north of the Preston-Blackburn-Burnley industrial belt. As monarch she is also Duke of Lancaster, so this is part of her Duchy to which she pays regular visits. One can certainly see the attraction. There is mile upon mile of enchantment. Try the drive east from Slaidburn to Lancaster along the Trough of Bowland - the valley which cleaves through the forest from east to west. The Yorkshire Dales, the Lake District (minus the lakes), the highlands of Scotland, wild Wales - there are echoes of all of them here, and it's wonderfully unravaged by time. I met only one tourist coach on Tuesday, though weekends are no doubt busier. There are not, it must be said, many properties which would serve unchanged as palaces. Stately homes are few. The Parker family have been at Browsholme Hall in the south-east for 500 years and may not yet be ready to quit. The Duke of Westminster has a place at Abbeystead on the wandering road to Lancaster but he too is no doubt keen to hang on to it. The Queen, they say, is a kindly soul and so not the sort to favour evictions. There are huge, remote, empty spaces here into which you could smuggle a marvellous 21st-century palace. Yet one would not wish to encourage promiscuous building in such a beautiful place. Better a brownfield site where an existing building could be adapted or an earlier one replaced. And happily, just such a spot exists to the east of the forest, in a sector which used to be Yorkshire but was cruelly wrenched into Lancashire in the 70s. In the delicious village of Bolton-by-Bowland, just south of the church, is a gate with a long and dignified avenue stretching into the distance. Follow the track and you come to a huddle of buildings which clearly used to belong to something statelier. This is the site of Bolton Hall, now demolished, but once the home of the Pudsay family. A monument in the church celebrates Sir Ralph Pudsay, his three wives and 25 children sleeping beside him: \"the faithful adherent\" says a plaque \"of King Henry VI whom he sheltered at Bolton Hall after the battle of Hexham.\" Here is the ideal site for a fine post-Mowlam palace.

Charles Kennedy, the Liberal Democrat leader, will attack Labour's record in an attempt to make pensions a key dividing line in the election. He will claim Labour has broken its promise to give older people a share in rising national prosperity and that it is a national disgrace that nearly one in three of our pensioners are still lving below the poverty line.

Other big payments are now anticipated from other banking groups. </p> <p>The payment follows a parliamentary investigation into allegations of non-payment of deposit income retention tax by bank account holders.

      "bodyText": "BA suffers traffic fall Two days of computer problems at British airports and a strike by French air traffic controllers caused a 1.4% drop in British Airways' June air traffic. But the airline said it had high hopes for the important summer season, as a slowdown in market capacity growth was helping to boost yields. Like several other airlines, British Airways cancelled 90% of its flights to and from France on June 26. Flights were also affected by a computer breakdown which caused problems at Heathrow on June 17 and 18. Canal-Plus to keep autonomy Pay television group Canal-Plus will continue to exist as a separate company run by its present chairman, Pierre Lescure, within Vivendi Universal, Vivendi's chairman Jean-Marie Messier said. He set out in a letter to Mr Lescure dated 19 June, published yesterday by Vivendi, how the pay-TV group will function following a three-way merger between Vivendi, Seagram and Canal. The group will cover all the activities now held by Canal-Plus - including buying, producing and selling rights to films, television programmes and sporting events - but will also include Seagram's Universal Studios. Bank of Ireland pays up A long-running investigation into the non-payment of tax in Ireland came to a head last night when Bank of Ireland, one of the top two Irish banking groups, admitted it had paid more than IR\u00a330m (\u00a324m) to the revenue commissioners. Other big payments are now anticipated from other banking groups. The payment follows a parliamentary investigation into allegations of non-payment of deposit income retention tax by bank account holders. An audit revealed that IR\u00a312.75m was owed in back tax over a 13-year period. The balance was made up of interest and penalties. US traders win approval American members of Tradepoint, the British electronic stock exchange, have been given regulatory approval to trade directly in European equities. The Securities and Exchange Commission has issued instructions which will allow US firms to deal on Tradepoint's pan-European blue chip market when it is launched next week. Tradepoint provides trading in 2,000 listed British companies but will add around 230 continental European equities. Car firm to lose 400 jobs Up to 400 jobs are to be lost through the closure of a factory which makes rubber sealing systems for cars. Automotive Sealing Systems' plants at Dunstable in Bedfordshire will undergo a \"phased closure\" by the end of next year. The company blamed overcapacity in the market and a drive for lower prices. The company will ask for volunteers, but some compulsory losses are expected.",

Mr Colvin, 67, the MP for Romsey, Hampshire, and his wife, 62, died when the blaze swept through Tangley House, near Andover, Hampshire, early on February 24. The mid-Hampshire coroner, Grahame Short, recorded an open verdict after concluding that the devastation caused by the fire meant it was impossible to establish the cause of death. The hearing in Winchester was told that fumes and flames would have spread upstairs through an open door to the bedrooms in which the couple were sleeping. Nichola Woolnough, the Colvins' housekeeper since 1990, told the inquest how she and her husband Peter, who lived in a nearby cottage, were woken by the smell of smoke at about 3am. With the couple's butler, Alvaro Perreira, who also lived on the Tangley estate, they tried to rescue the couple before calling the fire brigade. \"We saw a glow in the sky. We thought at first it was the summerhouse but as we got round there we realised there was a glow coming from the main house,\" Mrs Woolnough said. She said her husband and Mr Perreira had tried to enter the house but were beaten back by thick black smoke.

The share offer opened last Thursday and according to sources close to the company a strong response has been received from retail investors who have applied for shares on the condition they cannot sell for three months after trading begins on July 14. Retail investors who agree not to sell their shares for three months will receive priority allocations in the Carphone Warehouse flotation. The retail offer closes next Tuesday.

There's a very good conversion rate from meeting institutions.\" Around one-third of the proceeds from the flotation will be used to reduce debt and a further third will be used to fund the continued expansion of Carphone Warehouse across Europe. The company has 450 stores in Britain and a further 430 or so trading under the Phone House name throughout countries including France, Germany and the Netherlands. The remainder will be used to develop its other services in cluding Value Telecom, which repackages One2One airtime under the Carphone-owned brand, and Mviva, the group's wireless internet portal.

A couple of years ago it reverted back to its hour-long slot and was deliberately \"soapified\" in an attempt to keep up with the far-fetched plots of other ongoing dramas. The characters' domestic lives, once forbidden, crept in to spice up the show's notoriously mundane storylines and ratings duly rose. </p> <p>But The Bill is still a pale shadow of its former self, with audiences down from 13m in the heady days of 1992 to about 7m today. Last month there were even brief rumours that Thames's parent company Pearson was to cart the show off to that dinosaurs' graveyard of television, Channel 5. So it's perhaps an odd time for ITV to launch a spin-off series, Burnside, based on a character who stopped appearing on a regular basis seven years ago. </p> <p>Always something of a refugee from the 70s, DCI Frank Burnside (played by Christopher Ellison) often found himself up against The Bill's pre-watershed constraints. He'd burst into some petty criminal's council house, growl \"You're nicked, you slag\" and vanish, forever kept on a tight leash by the writers. Hence Ellison's departure from The Bill in the first place, lured away by the promise of his own show, Ellington, an ill-fated Minder-style drama about a boxing promoter. It eventually appeared on ITV in 1996 and was never heard of again. Though Ellison has since shown his face in a couple of shows, like Birds Of A Feather, his recent reappearance in The Bill was only as the warm-up for his own long-promised series. </p> <p>Now, with six post-watershed hours of his own to play with at last, Burnside begins as he means to go on. Five minutes into the first episode and we've been treated to a couple of \"shits\" and a \"wanker\" - words you'd never hear from his colleagues at Sun Hill. And the bodycount has gone through the roof. No longer fighting The Bill's unglamorous war against shoplifting single parents and domestic violence, Burnside now faces Uzi-wielding Yardies, international gun-runners and warped serial killers. \"Dark and adult\", is how the show's producer Jamie Nuttgens describes it all. \"The Bill has faced some criticism in the past but with Burnside we've pulled out all the stops.\" </p> <p>The series' writers capitalise further on our hero's often Neanderthal approach (eg bog-washing suspects till they confess) by placing him in the softly softly catchee monkey National Crime Squad. And yet more dramatic friction comes from writing Burnside's two new underlings as epitomes of political correctness - a no-bullshit feminist (played by Zoe Eeles) and a black gay character (Justin Pierre). </p> <p>Having the latter openly gay is not only something of a first for British mainstream telly, reckons Nuttgens, but also gives the character an interesting contradiction - gay but straight-laced. \"The UK is really bad for good black roles on TV,\" he says, \"and I wasn't going to make a major series set in London in the year 2000 without a black lead.\" Despite this, viewers will certainly notice some of the show's Sweeney-esque touches. (Ellison himself won his first acting job on that 70s series, and continued his TV tough-guy apprenticeship in shows like The Professionals, Minder and Widows.) Thames's new series also allows sitcom favourite Paul Nicholas to break out from his usual role and try something more serious as a ruthless, media-friendly gangster. Even more surprising is the appearance of a peroxide blonde Shane Ritchie, who pops up throughout the series as Burnside's lowlife grass. </p> <p>But while these two co-stars of this elegantly-shot series seem able to shuffle off their typecasts with relative ease, Burnside's star, judging by his return to a role he vacated in 1993, is obviously finding it a little harder. </p> <p>Burnside, tonight, 9pm, ITV</p>",

      "body": "<b> I recently heard of Jeffrey Hudson, a 17th century \"dwarf\", who ran with the pirates, constantly duelled his detractors and was frequently presented to high society encased in a pie or a cake. Does anyone know more about him?</b> <p> * It is, perhaps, only right that Sir Jeffrey Hudson (1619-1682), England's smallest man, was born in England's smallest county, Rutland. The son of an Oakham butcher, Sir Jeffrey was normally proportioned but only 18 inches tall until well into middle age, when he \"grew\" to a height of 3ft 6ins. </p> <p>He came to the attention of Henrietta Maria, the wife of Charles I, when he was hidden inside a venison pie at a banquet in her honour held at the Duke of Buckingham's home near Oakham, where he was a page. He remained a loyal servant to the Queen and saw service during the civil war but, as a Catholic, was caught up in the panic surrounding the Popish Plot. After a spell in prison, he was released and lived off a pension supplied by the new Duke of Buckingham, the son of his first sponsor. </p> <p>There is a short (sic) biography of Sir Jeffrey in Aubrey's Brief Lives, and he was also written into one of Sir Walter Scott's lesser-known Waverley Novels, Peveril of the Peak, where his appearance and life are described in detail. </p> <p>The most famous painting of Sir Jeffrey is Van Dyke's Queen Henrietta Maria with Sir Jeffrey Hudson and an Ape, in the National Gallery, Washington DC. There are other portraits in a private collection near Oakham and at Petworth House in Sussex; his clothing can be seen at Sherborne Castle, Dorset; but the strangest artefact is a life-sized statue in the public bar of the Boat Inn in Portumna, County Galway. </p> <p>The house where Sir Jeffrey was born (The Dwarf's Cottage) has recently been given a blue plaque and, although it is privately owned and not open to the public, its traditional English garden will be opened this coming Sunday, July 9, as part of the festival Oakham in Bloom. </p> <p> Michael Walton, Pordenone, Italy. </p> <p>* In her contribution \"Some Famous Dwarfs\" to A Pageant of History (Collins, 1958), Frances Collingwood gives the following information: </p> <p>\"When the Queen [Henrietta Maria] fled to Paris, [Hudson] went with her and there fought two famous duels. The first was against a turkey cock and the second against a Mr Crofts. The man did not take his little opponent seriously and turned up armed only with a squirt. Sir Jeffrey, mounted on horseback to bring him up to Crofts' level, shot his opponent dead. Leaving Paris in a hurry, he tried to return to England, but pirates caught him in the Channel and he was sold into slavery.\" </p> <p> Mrs A A Hesson, Burnley, Lancs. </p> <p> <b> Why are some countries, such as The Gambia, prefixed with \"The\", even when they are not plural (like The Netherlands).</b> </p> <p> * It isn't a question of singular and plural. Some countries do not have true names but only descriptions (\"the United Kingdom\", \"the Czech Republic\", \"the Netherlands\", etc). As for \"the Gambia\" and \"the Congo\", they simply use the names of their main rivers (as if England were called \"the Trent\") - but then Uruguay is similarly named, and we don't call that \"the Uruguay\". A few take \"the\" purely by accident of language (\"the Ukraine\") and this applies to regions as well as countries: consider \"the Algarve\" and \"the Punjab\", but not \"the Tuscany\" or \"the Kosovo\". All in all, it's more or less random, like most things in language (and I live in the only town on earth whose English name takes \"the\"). </p> <p> Jim Burfield, The Hague, Netherlands. </p> <p> <b> Is there any proof that homeopathic medicine works?</b> </p> <p> * No, but the less proof there is, the more effectively it works. </p> <p> Les Killip, Newton-le-Willows, Merseyside. </p> <p>* No properly conducted study has yet produced convincing evidence that it has any more value than a placebo. The Homeopathic Medicine Research Group, convened by the European Commission, examined 184 published and unpublished reports of controlled trials of homeopathic treatments. </p> <p>Its report (1996) concluded that only 17 of these trials were conducted well enough to be considered. While some may have demonstrated an effect greater than a placebo, overall the number of participants in the 17 trials was too small to permit any conclusions about the effectiveness of any given treatment for a specific condition. </p> <p>This is not surprising. The basic principles of homeopathy, laid down by Samuel Hahnemann in the late 1700s (diseases are a manifestation of a \"psora\" or suppressed itch, the smaller the dose the greater the effect) have no demonstrable relationship with each other or with what we know about human biology. The only people for whom it could be said to \"work\" are hard-pressed GPs, who can pass their more persistent and intractable patients on to an \"alternative\" practioner, safe in the knowledge that no great harm is likely to be done. </p> <p>The best detailed critique of homeopathy is probably still Homeopathy and its Kindred Delusions, first delivered as two lectures by Oliver Wendell Holmes in 1842. </p> <p> Michael Hutton, Camberwell, London SE5. </p> <p>* There are several levels of evidence for the effectiveness of homeopathy, which has the best research profile of the alternative medical systems. Thoughtlessly disregarded by the scientific community is so-called \"anecdotal evidence\", the best of which includes reports of clinical experience by homeopathic doctors who have used conventional methods with less success. Taken together, this material suggests to a fair-minded observer that something interesting is taking place. </p> <p>Secondly, there is some good-quality historical evidence, particularly the experience of the American and European homeopathic hospitals in the 19th century, where mortality from infectious diseases like cholera was markedly lower than in conventional hospitals. In the modern period, the Society of Homeopaths has published reports on the work of members in primary care groups in the UK. </p> <p>Most importantly, a significant body of scientific literature, mainly reports of clinical trials, has accumulated over the past 20 years or so. Four meta-analyses have been published, and the broad agreement is that homeopathic medicines work well. Where there is still a lack of clarity is the question of how they work. Not that a lack of understanding of mechanism ever stopped drugs and therapies being introduced into orthodox medicine. </p> <p> Dr Denis MacEoin, chairman, The Natural Medicines Society, Newcastle upon Tyne. </p> <p> <b> In the novel The Devil Rides Out, Dennis Wheatley refers to the \"Sussamma Ritual\" - the only one of his mythological references I have been unable to track down. Was it made up by the author?</b> </p> <p> * William Hope Hodgson wrote a series of connected short stories, Carnacki the Ghost-Finder (1913) in which the eponymous hero investigated apparently supernatural events, some of which proved to have a natural explanation while others were genuine. </p> <p>The stories contained several motifs - protective pentacles, ancient manuscripts and rituals - found in later novels, including The Devil Rides Out (1935). In several of the stories, reference is made to the Saaamaaa Ritual, which has protective properties like the not dissimilar Sussamma Ritual. One may compare \"And then suddenly the Unknown Last Line of the Saaamaaa Ritual was whispered quite audibly in the room,\" (The Whistling Room, in Carnacki the Ghost-Finder) with \"In a clear, sharp voice he pronounced the last two lines of the dread Sussamma Ritual\" (The Devil Rides Out). </p> <p>Wheatley was familiar with Hodgson's work - he included one of his stories in an anthology he edited (A Century of Horror Stories, 1935) - and it has been suggested that Hodgson's novel, The Boats of the Glen Carrig, inspired Wheatley's Uncharted Seas. </p> <p>It is possible that the Sussamma Ritual was Wheatley's tribute to a writer whose work he admired. </p> <p> Brian Rolls, Reading, Berks. </p> <p> <b> Why doesn't the government increase the price of fuel and abolish the annual vehicle road tax?</b> </p> <p> * Because the road haulage industry would not be pleased. The annual road fund licence represents a huge cross-subsidy to the haulage industry from the ordinary motorist. Many years ago, the Transport Research Laboratory demonstrated that the damage to our roads caused by vehicles is proportional to the fourth power of the axle weight. </p> <p>As the road tax is raised to fund the building and repair of roads, this would mean that, if the cost was shared equitably, for every \u00a3100 paid by the motorist, the owner of a heavy lorry would have to pay at least \u00a31m - and that figure does not take into account the higher annual mileage of the lorry. </p> <p>In the short term, making road hauliers pay their full \"track\" costs would boost inflation, but in the longer term it might enable rail freight to compete on a level playing field. </p> <p> Roger Wood, Breachwood Green, Herts. </p> <p> <b> Why do wasps and bees hover round the outside of windows trying to get in, and then hover round the inside trying to get out?</b> </p> <p> * Perhaps the glass is cleaner on the other side of the sill. </p> <p> Chris du Feu, Beckingham, Notts. <br><br><b>Any answers?</b><br><br> Has any tennis player ever actually poured himself or herself a glass of barley water during a match at Wimbledon? </p> <p>Peter Dodds, Durham. </p> <p> The new lead-replacement petrol is still 5p per litre more than unleaded. Who gets the extra 5p? </p> <p>Jo Duncan, Bromley, Kent. </p> <p> Apparently a Scottish colony was established in south or central America around the 16th century. Does anyone know about this? </p> <p>John and Renee Dolan, London NW2. </p> <p> When a football match is televised, why is the camera always on this side of the pitch? </p> <p>Hugh Kelly, Sheffield. </p> <p> Why are native Europeans, native Americans or native Africans not called \"aborigines\"? </p> <p>Candido Da Cruz, Madrid.</p>",

In the modern period, the Society of Homeopaths has published reports on the work of members in primary care groups in the UK. Most importantly, a significant body of scientific literature, mainly reports of clinical trials, has accumulated over the past 20 years or so. Four meta-analyses have been published, and the broad agreement is that homeopathic medicines work well. Where there is still a lack of clarity is the question of how they work. Not that a lack of understanding of mechanism ever stopped drugs and therapies being introduced into orthodox medicine. Dr Denis MacEoin, chairman, The Natural Medicines Society, Newcastle upon Tyne. In the novel The Devil Rides Out, Dennis Wheatley refers to the \"Sussamma Ritual\" - the only one of his mythological references I have been unable to track down. Was it made up by the author? * William Hope Hodgson wrote a series of connected short stories, Carnacki the Ghost-Finder (1913) in which the eponymous hero investigated apparently supernatural events, some of which proved to have a natural explanation while others were genuine. The stories contained several motifs - protective pentacles, ancient manuscripts and rituals - found in later novels, including The Devil Rides Out (1935). In several of the stories, reference is made to the Saaamaaa Ritual, which has protective properties like the not dissimilar Sussamma Ritual. One may compare \"And then suddenly the Unknown Last Line of the Saaamaaa Ritual was whispered quite audibly in the room,\" (The Whistling Room, in Carnacki the Ghost-Finder) with \"In a clear, sharp voice he pronounced the last two lines of the dread Sussamma Ritual\" (The Devil Rides Out). Wheatley was familiar with Hodgson's work - he included one of his stories in an anthology he edited (A Century of Horror Stories, 1935) - and it has been suggested that Hodgson's novel, The Boats of the Glen Carrig, inspired Wheatley's Uncharted Seas. It is possible that the Sussamma Ritual was Wheatley's tribute to a writer whose work he admired. Brian Rolls, Reading, Berks. Why doesn't the government increase the price of fuel and abolish the annual vehicle road tax? * Because the road haulage industry would not be pleased. The annual road fund licence represents a huge cross-subsidy to the haulage industry from the ordinary motorist. Many years ago, the Transport Research Laboratory demonstrated that the damage to our roads caused by vehicles is proportional to the fourth power of the axle weight. As the road tax is raised to fund the building and repair of roads, this would mean that, if the cost was shared equitably, for every \u00a3100 paid by the motorist, the owner of a heavy lorry would have to pay at least \u00a31m - and that figure does not take into account the higher annual mileage of the lorry. In the short term, making road hauliers pay their full \"track\" costs would boost inflation, but in the longer term it might enable rail freight to compete on a level playing field. Roger Wood, Breachwood Green, Herts. Why do wasps and bees hover round the outside of windows trying to get in, and then hover round the inside trying to get out? * Perhaps the glass is cleaner on the other side of the sill. Chris du Feu, Beckingham, Notts. Any answers? Has any tennis player ever actually poured himself or herself a glass of barley water during a match at Wimbledon? Peter Dodds, Durham. The new lead-replacement petrol is still 5p per litre more than unleaded. Who gets the extra 5p? Jo Duncan, Bromley, Kent. Apparently a Scottish colony was established in south or central America around the 16th century. Does anyone know about this? John and Renee Dolan, London NW2. When a football match is televised, why is the camera always on this side of the pitch? Hugh Kelly, Sheffield. Why are native Europeans, native Americans or native Africans not called \"aborigines\"?

Ignoring intense lobbying by the British government, Euro-MPs promised to look into the so-called Echelon system of satellites and listening posts, reported to be used to intercept millions of telephone, fax and e-mail messages. Britain and the United States have repeatedly denied using Echelon to gain commercial advantages over their European allies. The French counter-intelligence service, the DST, is already conducting an investigation. The parliamentary committee's mandate is to establish whether Echelon really exists, whether European industry has been damaged by the clandestine interception of communications, and whether the privacy of individuals can be protected from spying. The committee, chaired by a Portuguese MEP, aims to report its findings in about eight months. British officials were studying its precise terms of reference last night. As it has no power to summon witnesses or subpoena documents, any cooperation would be purely voluntary. \"It is in danger of being no more than a talking shop,\" said Heidi Hautala, co-leader of the Green faction in parliament, whose call for a wider mandate was defeated by 340 votes to 210. Whitehall worked hard to stifle the debate, insisting that any discussion would have to be a general one about the interception of communications, so that other countries' intelligence capacity - notably that of France - would also come under scrutiny. Britain also pointed to the benefits of intelligence shared with allies in the struggle against drug trafficking, terrorism, \"rogue\" states and money-laundering. But the issue is an uncomfortable one for the Blair government, because it highlights and exaggerates its choice of loyalties - to its US or its European partners - at a time when strenuous efforts are being made to advance Europe's defence capacity without weakening Nato. \"We have always made it clear that the civil rights of EU citizens are not jeopardised by legally endorsed interception as practised in the UK,\" a British diplomat said. MEPs demanded an investigation after a former director of the CIA, James Woolsey, admitted that eavesdropping equipment had been used to intercept the communications of European companies. He said it was a question not of industrial espionage but of checking for sanctions-busting and bribery. Echelon, based at Fort Meade in Maryland and GCHQ in Cheltenham, has out-stations in Canada, New Zealand and Australia, giving rise to the suggestion that it is an anti-European \"Anglo-Saxon\" conspiracy. The concern of libertarians, although focused on privacy and accountability, is mixed with a strong dose of anti-American feeling, some of which is shared by governments, especially France's. But most national capitals are extremely wary about opening up what could prove to be a can of worms. The French investigation into Echelon is unlikely to be followed through, simply because its own spying could then be easily exposed. \"Anything which focuses attention on Echelon specifically, and the interception of communications in general, is a good thing,\" said Tony Bunyan of the civil liberties group Statewatch. \"There's no doubt that the UK potentially has an advantage, both in economic and diplomatic matters, over its 14 EU partners.\" The shadow foreign secretary, Francis Maude, accused MEPs of \"trying to drive a wedge between Britain and the United States\". \"This commission is nothing more than a political witch-hunt,\" he said. \"Anti-American members of the European parliament are being used to put our special intelligence relationship with the United States on trial. \"Robin Cook should make very clear where he stands . . . and condemn this commission and the EU governments who are manipulating this issue. \"For the French to accuse others of running an intelligence service without democratic control is laughable.

      "body": "<p>One of Sigmund Freud's observations about the patients who passed through his Viennese consulting room was that they did not share the same idea of the beautiful. Instead of pursuing what 19th-century culture defined as a legitimate object of desire, they formed weird and wonderful attachments to things no one else would find interesting. One man came to him saying he \"exulted\" in seeing a certain sort of shine on the nose. This was the kind of encounter that led Freud to develop his theory of fetishism. </p> <p>You can see how this conflicted with the idea of the beautiful human form that Freud and his contemporaries inherited from the Renaissance. If Michelangelo, instead of sculpting David in his entirety, had confined himself to his nose, western art would look very different. </p> <p>The story of modern times is the story of beauty's fragmentation. The idea of a universal beauty, an ideal, a norm, has disintegrated. Art has become as idiosyncratic as Freud's patients. Instead of painting a vision of supreme human beauty like Botticelli's Venus, modern artists fixate on fragments, details, bits of the body. Salvador Dali, for example, prided himself on painting women's bottoms better than anyone else; his fellow surrealist Hans Bellmer made life-size female dolls that he delighted in dismantling and putting back together. </p> <p>Today very few people would say we like to look because we are students of the beautiful. We know our pleasures to be base. We have heard of Freud. Fetishism is main stream culture. And this has consequences for the way we look at art. As the French surrealist Georges Bataille put it: \"I defy any art lover to love a painting as much as a fetishist loves a shoe.\" What does it all mean? Has the religion of an ideal beauty given way to a democracy of perverse pleasures - and if so, is that a good or a bad thing? </p> <p>According to the feminist cultural theorist Laura Mulvey, the key aspect to Freud's theory of fetishism is that it \"involves the overvaluation of something that would not be valued by the rest of the culture. An individual invests their erotic energy into it and makes it into a sexual fetish that can be a replacement for, or an enablement of, an actual sexual relation.\" </p> <p>Beauty is to do with wholeness. Fetishism is a pleasure in fragments, explains Mulvey. She is talking specifically about the way we watch films. Once, film lovers passively watched images unroll in dark cinemas. Today we watch videos, DVDs, download films from the internet. \"You can watch your favourite bits. You can prioritise certain special moments. You can break it down into a relationship with particular gestures, particular looks, so that the voyeurism of the old days is being replaced by a fetishism, a personal attachment to certain fragments, moments, gestures, rather than a collective way of looking.\" Is that a liberating thing? \"I think it certainly gives people greater control over the spectacle.\" </p> <p>Mulvey is a film-maker - she made the avant-garde films Penthesilia, Queen of the Amazons (1974) and Riddles of the Sphinx (1977) - as well a hugely influential film theorist. But any discussion of her work has to return again and again to her 1975 article Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema. \"It is said that analysing pleasure or beauty, destroys it,\" Mulvey wrote. \"That is the intention of this article.\" One section is titled Destruction of Pleasure as a Radical Weapon. Mulvey now says she intended it to read like a manifesto. \"I was aiming to shock. It was clearly coming out of the early days of the women's movement. I'd been involved with the Miss World demonstration a couple of years before.\" </p> <p>Mulvey's manifesto reads like the great modern attacks on art, from the Dada manifestos that appeared in Zurich during the first world war denouncing culture as a bourgeois lie to the post-war Paris Situationists who demonstrated against Charlie Chaplin. Her essay Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema is part of this anti-aesthetic tradition because it argues that pleasure is oppressive: the profoundly satisfying visual pleasure of golden-age Hollywood, its beauty if you like, is inseparable from the way it defined women as erotic objects. An example she gives is the way Lauren Bacall in the 1945 movie To Have and Have Not goes from being \"isolated, glamorous, on display, sexualised\" as she sings in a club at the beginning of the film to being possessed by Humphrey Bogart. </p> <p>Mulvey admits she was depicting a dying world. The Hollywood studio system was doomed and so was its cult of beauty. Her essay describes how Hollywood's desire to possess the female body whole, to frame it and own it, conflicts with the technique of the close-up, which is part of film's sexuality but also something that threatens to destroy narrative, to freeze the action in a timeless fetishistic gaze. </p> <p>This phenomenon is explored obsessively, she wrote, in the films Josef von Sternberg made with Marlene Dietrich, in which the close-up overwhelms the film. Sternberg produces the ultimate fetish.\"The beauty of the woman as object and the screen space coalesce.\" Today, we are all amateur von Sternbergs, able to fix on the images we like, download them, play with them. </p> <p>The birth of this culture is anticipated in Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo (1958). \"It's pretty clear now with all the research that's been done on Hitchcock that he was very conscious of what he was doing,\" says Mulvey. In Vertigo the detective played by James Stewart believes he is simply susceptible to beauty when he falls in love with the woman he is following; but then she appears to die before his eyes and he tries to make over a woman he meets at a hotel to look like her, to replicate her icy blonde beauty. We recognise - as he seems unable to - the madness of it all as he fetishistically re-creates her hair, her dress, her shoes. \"It can't matter to you,\" he tells the young woman he is forcing into this straitjacket of Hitchcockian beauty. </p> <p>The fetish is about loss, says Mulvey. Stewart in Vertigo is obsessed with reconstituting a lost moment of perfect happiness. For Freud, she explains, the birth of the fetish is always about a sense of something missing; and Marx, too, used it in this way. Marx described the aestheticisation of the commodity in a capitalist culture as \"fetishistic\". You could see today's plural, consumerist visual pleasures in just this way. For Marx, she says, \"what is lost is the worker's labour, which is concealed under the gloss and glamour of the commodity itself\". </p> <p>Mulvey's analysis of fetishism may refer to film narrative and the way we can now disassemble it as we watch, but it can also be applied to contemporary culture generally, the way it is given over to endlessly multiplying and dividing visual pleasures. We value the clip over the film, the aesthetic fragment over the whole. You can see this in contemporary art where the object of desire is systematically broken up and mutated. Take Sarah Lucas's sculptures in which breasts covered in phallic tubular cigarettes float free of the body. Take the American artist Matthew Barney, whose films and installations dissolve the body in glossy make-up, masks and prosthetic limbs. This sensibility began with Andy Warhol's fragmentation of Marilyn Monroe's image in the Marilyn Diptych - which he painted after her death and based on a fan's fetishised photo collection. </p> <p>The rise of the fetish is the final chapter in the death of beauty as Ruskin imagined it, as a moral language implanted in nature by God. But the point about the fetish, as Mulvey points out, is that it contains a hidden history. For Freud this history is personal, for Marx it is social. It is a history that haunts modern pleasure, and means that every time we console ourselves we are also acknowledging what has been lost. </p> <p>And the thing we might be missing is the idea of a social whole. For all the oppression and authoritarianism that cling to the old idea of formal beauty, it is also true that it was an image of wholeness. This aesthetic wholeness was connected, in 18th-century thought, with the image of a healthy society. Today we are no more able to talk about political utopias than aesthetic ideals. Is it possible they are related? </p> <p>Next week: John Berger explores light in painting.</p>",

      "bodyText": "One of Sigmund Freud's observations about the patients who passed through his Viennese consulting room was that they did not share the same idea of the beautiful. Instead of pursuing what 19th-century culture defined as a legitimate object of desire, they formed weird and wonderful attachments to things no one else would find interesting. One man came to him saying he \"exulted\" in seeing a certain sort of shine on the nose. This was the kind of encounter that led Freud to develop his theory of fetishism. You can see how this conflicted with the idea of the beautiful human form that Freud and his contemporaries inherited from the Renaissance. If Michelangelo, instead of sculpting David in his entirety, had confined himself to his nose, western art would look very different. The story of modern times is the story of beauty's fragmentation. The idea of a universal beauty, an ideal, a norm, has disintegrated. Art has become as idiosyncratic as Freud's patients. Instead of painting a vision of supreme human beauty like Botticelli's Venus, modern artists fixate on fragments, details, bits of the body. Salvador Dali, for example, prided himself on painting women's bottoms better than anyone else; his fellow surrealist Hans Bellmer made life-size female dolls that he delighted in dismantling and putting back together. Today very few people would say we like to look because we are students of the beautiful. We know our pleasures to be base. We have heard of Freud. Fetishism is main stream culture. And this has consequences for the way we look at art. As the French surrealist Georges Bataille put it: \"I defy any art lover to love a painting as much as a fetishist loves a shoe.\" What does it all mean?

In advance of National Kissing Day, there was even a conference in London last weekend about the role of the kiss in history, with discussions of its place in art and culture from Graeco-Roman antiquity to Paris in the 1950s. A slight subject, at first sight, for a serious academic conference? Not according to the organisers, who describe the kiss as \"a capacious carrier of much social, political and cultural freight\".</p> <p>A kiss, in other words, is more than just a kiss. It consists, in Freud's passion-killing formulation, of the \"sexual use of the mucous membranes of the lips and mouth\". But if sex is the first connection that comes to mind when considering the kiss, it is far from being the only one. The programme for the conference, organised by Royal Holloway's Bedford Centre for the History of Women, points out that it ranges from \"the stylized performative gesture to the ordinary ingredient of daily conversation\" - from stage kisses to perfunctory ones, from politicians kissing babies to a peck on the cheek between friends.</p> <p>But wait a minute. How many of us have actually witnessed a parliamentary candidate kissing a passing infant? Did Nelson really say \"Kiss me, Hardy\" as he lay dying? Other theories about kissing claim it is such an intimate act that prostitutes never allow clients to kiss them, but no one ever quotes an indentifiable source for this piece of wisdom. Kissing is so embedded in everyday life, whether in the form of a passionate embrace or an affectionate salutation, that myths have grown up around it and exist, for the most part, unchallenged.</p> <p>Last weekend's conference set out to examine some of these meanings. There were discussions of the dying kiss in the trenches of the first world war, the kiss of peace in early modern religion, the kiss of life in 18th-century resuscitation. That such attention is being paid to an apparently spontaneous gesture is a step in deconstructing it, for one of the most striking things about the kiss is how often it is anything but impulsive.</p> <p>The most famous images, such as Robert D'Oisneau's photograph of lovers kissing outside the Hotel de Ville in Paris, often turn out to have been staged. In spite of the woman's apparent oblivion to anything but her boyfriend's passion, they were in fact actors who spent hours under D'Oisneau's direction.</p> <p>Another celebrated kiss, when the Prince of Wales embraced his bride on a balcony at Buckingham Palace, travelled around the world on TV screens and was reproduced in millions of newspapers and magazines. Yet this picture, which all but cynics and republicans read at the time as a pure expression of romantic love, has now come to represent a very different kind of kiss, that of betrayal.</p> <p>It is quite likely that both readings are wrong, in the sense that Diana was trying to inhabit a fairy tale and her spouse simply going along with what was required of him; royalty is a species of performance, staged for the masses, and Charles's kiss may have been no more insincere than the Queen's small talk at official ceremonies and garden parties. But the notion of the Judas kiss, the embrace offered with an evil motive, remains powerful. A Kiss Before Dying, Kiss Me Deadly, Kiss of the Vampire, Kiss of Death, Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye and Kiss Me, Kill Me are just a few of the movie titles that explicitly link intimacy, deception and danger.</p> <p>This is because the kiss is an intimate gesture involving two people whose actions may mimic each other while their intent is very different. It is an unspoken transaction, fraught with opportunities for bad faith and misunderstanding: it may mean anything from \"Hello\" to \"I love you\", from \"I quite fancy you\" to \"I would like to have passionate sex with you this instant\". Although the distinction between a peck on the cheek and a kiss with erotic intention may seem obvious, the taboo on certain kinds of kissing suggests the opposite, at least in the eyes of some observers.</p> <p>\"The kiss of friendship between men is strictly avoided as inclining towards the sin regarded in England as more abominable than any other,\" a German travel guide advised in 1819. A recent NOP poll suggests that homophobia is as rampant as ever in Britain: 62% of the men questioned said they would be terrified of being labelled gay if they gave another man a kiss or accepted one from him, while 53% of Yorkshiremen said they would hit a man who tried to kiss them. When Prince Charles greeted his brother Andrew with a kiss at Ascot two years ago, it was unusual enough to cause speculation, though not about his sexuality. Commentators wondered whether it marked a relaxation in royal mores, a perfect example of the weight of meaning attached to this simple act.</p> <p>Another is the fear, sometimes expressed by pubescent girls who have not received sex education, that kissing can lead to pregnancy. If discussions of kissing almost always lead back to sexuality, it is no accident, for the mouth is a potent vehicle of desire, even if what it is seeking is not always obvious. Naturally it represents appetite, in the sense of being the organ that ingests food, but it is more complicated than that. In the language of romance, kisses are often hungry or greedy, as though one person (usually the man) is intent on devouring the other.</p> <p>Kissing as a form of insatiable hunger is the theme of Roman writer Catullus's famous poem, in which he demands hundreds, then thousands, of kisses from his lover. The image becomes positively cannibalistic in Under The Jaguar Sun, where Italo Calvino's lovers kiss with the intensity of \"serpents concentrated in the ecstasy of swallowing each other in turn\". These are potent images, confusing and conflating two pleasures, sex and eating, in a way that supports Freud's characterisation of kissing as an unconscious repetition of infantile delight in feeding.</p> <p>\"No one who has seen a baby sinking back satiated from the breast and falling asleep with flushed cheeks and a blissful smile can escape the reflection that this picture persists as a prototype of the expression of sexual satisfaction in later life,\" he wrote in Three Essays on Sexuality. In infancy, the flow is one-way, which is a significant difference between a child ingesting milk and two adults kissing; it may explain not only the intensity of the adult experience, but the unconscious fears that seem to accompany it.</p> <p>It is clearly right to view the mouth-on-mouth kiss not just as a preliminary to genital sex but as an erotic end in itself. If it wasn't, people would not have expended so much energy on banning it in public places, setting limits to how it could be shown in movies, painting it on Greek vases and writing poems about it. No wonder a friend of mine insists that those delicious Italian confections named after kisses ( baci ) are really chocolate orgasms.</p>",

Kissing is so embedded in everyday life, whether in the form of a passionate embrace or an affectionate salutation, that myths have grown up around it and exist, for the most part, unchallenged. Last weekend's conference set out to examine some of these meanings. There were discussions of the dying kiss in the trenches of the first world war, the kiss of peace in early modern religion, the kiss of life in 18th-century resuscitation. That such attention is being paid to an apparently spontaneous gesture is a step in deconstructing it, for one of the most striking things about the kiss is how often it is anything but impulsive. The most famous images, such as Robert D'Oisneau's photograph of lovers kissing outside the Hotel de Ville in Paris, often turn out to have been staged. In spite of the woman's apparent oblivion to anything but her boyfriend's passion, they were in fact actors who spent hours under D'Oisneau's direction. Another celebrated kiss, when the Prince of Wales embraced his bride on a balcony at Buckingham Palace, travelled around the world on TV screens and was reproduced in millions of newspapers and magazines. Yet this picture, which all but cynics and republicans read at the time as a pure expression of romantic love, has now come to represent a very different kind of kiss, that of betrayal. It is quite likely that both readings are wrong, in the sense that Diana was trying to inhabit a fairy tale and her spouse simply going along with what was required of him; royalty is a species of performance, staged for the masses, and Charles's kiss may have been no more insincere than the Queen's small talk at official ceremonies and garden parties. But the notion of the Judas kiss, the embrace offered with an evil motive, remains powerful. A Kiss Before Dying, Kiss Me Deadly, Kiss of the Vampire, Kiss of Death, Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye and Kiss Me, Kill Me are just a few of the movie titles that explicitly link intimacy, deception and danger. This is because the kiss is an intimate gesture involving two people whose actions may mimic each other while their intent is very different. It is an unspoken transaction, fraught with opportunities for bad faith and misunderstanding: it may mean anything from \"Hello\" to \"I love you\", from \"I quite fancy you\" to \"I would like to have passionate sex with you this instant\". Although the distinction between a peck on the cheek and a kiss with erotic intention may seem obvious, the taboo on certain kinds of kissing suggests the opposite, at least in the eyes of some observers. \"The kiss of friendship between men is strictly avoided as inclining towards the sin regarded in England as more abominable than any other,\" a German travel guide advised in 1819. A recent NOP poll suggests that homophobia is as rampant as ever in Britain: 62% of the men questioned said they would be terrified of being labelled gay if they gave another man a kiss or accepted one from him, while 53% of Yorkshiremen said they would hit a man who tried to kiss them. When Prince Charles greeted his brother Andrew with a kiss at Ascot two years ago, it was unusual enough to cause speculation, though not about his sexuality. Commentators wondered whether it marked a relaxation in royal mores, a perfect example of the weight of meaning attached to this simple act. Another is the fear, sometimes expressed by pubescent girls who have not received sex education, that kissing can lead to pregnancy. If discussions of kissing almost always lead back to sexuality, it is no accident, for the mouth is a potent vehicle of desire, even if what it is seeking is not always obvious. Naturally it represents appetite, in the sense of being the organ that ingests food, but it is more complicated than that. In the language of romance, kisses are often hungry or greedy, as though one person (usually the man) is intent on devouring the other. Kissing as a form of insatiable hunger is the theme of Roman writer Catullus's famous poem, in which he demands hundreds, then thousands, of kisses from his lover. The image becomes positively cannibalistic in Under The Jaguar Sun, where Italo Calvino's lovers kiss with the intensity of \"serpents concentrated in the ecstasy of swallowing each other in turn\". These are potent images, confusing and conflating two pleasures, sex and eating, in a way that supports Freud's characterisation of kissing as an unconscious repetition of infantile delight in feeding. \"No one who has seen a baby sinking back satiated from the breast and falling asleep with flushed cheeks and a blissful smile can escape the reflection that this picture persists as a prototype of the expression of sexual satisfaction in later life,\" he wrote in Three Essays on Sexuality. In infancy, the flow is one-way, which is a significant difference between a child ingesting milk and two adults kissing; it may explain not only the intensity of the adult experience, but the unconscious fears that seem to accompany it. It is clearly right to view the mouth-on-mouth kiss not just as a preliminary to genital sex but as an erotic end in itself. If it wasn't, people would not have expended so much energy on banning it in public places, setting limits to how it could be shown in movies, painting it on Greek vases and writing poems about it. No wonder a friend of mine insists that those delicious Italian confections named after kisses ( baci ) are really chocolate orgasms.",

The protesters, including the directors Tonie Marshall, Romain Goupil and Claire Denis, were reacting to a decision by the state council to overturn a censorship board ruling that it could be seen by over-16s. The original decision made it compulsory to display a warning that the film was \"an uninterrupted sequence of particularly crude sex and images of particular violence that could profoundly disturb audiences\" - a warning which did not mention that the production had been panned by the critics. It was described as a \"bad film\" by Le Parisien, as \"bad advertising for sex\" by Le Point, of \"no interest\" by Les Echos, and \"using ass to sell blood and horror\" by the left wing Nouvel Observateur.

      "body": "<p>In 1999 there were more disasters than ever before and they killed more people than any year in the decade except one. According to the latest Red Cross report, there were 623 forest fires, floods, landslides, avalanches, earthquakes, tsunamis, epidemics, droughts and volcanic eruptions in Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe and Oceania. They did economic damage estimated at $72bn, they disrupted the lives of 212 million and they killed more than 80,000. </p> <p>This death toll was the worst since 1991, when a single cyclone swept over Bangladesh and killed 139,000, and a series of cholera epidemics took 19,000 lives in Africa. Last year, floods in Venezuela claimed 30,000 lives when a hillside collapsed and took the shanty towns with it. It was a particularly destructive year in a destructive decade, ironically declared by the UN to be the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction: ironic because there were more disasters, more deaths and greater economic damage at the end of the decade than the beginning. </p> <p>But the sum of these things, each appalling on its own, was nothing compared to the real catastrophe, says Peter Walker, director of disaster policy at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in Geneva. The real disaster was not that 80,000 died from natural calamity. It was that in the same year 30 million died from entirely preventable diseases. </p> <p>\"I have just had a colleague come back from the Sumatra earthquake. It was a huge earthquake in geological terms, and hit a very undeveloped area of Indonesia. But when he gets there, the actual damage from the earthquake isn't that great; the houses are wooden structures so they don't collapse much. But what he found was an endemic problem of rampant malaria, rampant communicable diseases and levels of mortality and morbidity that are totally unacceptable. That is the disaster, not the earthquake.\" </p> <p>North Korea is billed as a food emergency, says Walker. But the chronic stunting of children was caused not by hunger this year, but by repeated, year-by-year health problems. North Korea used to be fine: cradle-to-grave security, a doctor for every 134 families and a state which had eradicated tuberculosis. Now there are 40,000 new cases of TB a year, people are giving themselves diarrhoea by eating corn husks and grass to stave off famine and to keep the hospitals warm, the medical staff have had to scrape soot from the chimneys and burn it again. </p> <p>People who are sick cannot work. People who cannot work cannot feed themselves or their families. People who are not well-fed cannot get better. Poverty and ill health stalk each other, and sick nations end up with sick governments which have been spending up to 50 times as much on military hardware as they do on disease control. Since 1945 a total of 23 million people have been killed in war. But 150 million have been killed by just three infectious diseases: Aids, malaria and tuberculosis. </p> <p>Since the nuclear reactor at Chernobyl blew up 14 years ago, thyroid cancer figures are rising and deformities have risen 83% in the most contaminated areas of Belarus. Two million people in the region - including 500,000 children - lack adequate health care. </p> <p>\"Those are the real disasters and tackling them isn't done by firefighting. In many ways we at the Red Cross have got to change our arsenal. It is no longer good enough to have the commando troops, we have got to have the infantry on the ground - our volunteers - and they have got to start working in a way that is much more programmed,\" says Walker. </p> <p>The African Red Cross and Red Crescent societies sat down with government health ministries, Unicef, the World Health Organisation. They came up with a set of 20 things that could be done in the community, and which could be bankrolled for 10 years rather than one or two. They were simple things that Red Cross volunteers could tackle: clean water, nutrition advice, hygiene education, and vaccination against the great child-killing diseases. </p> <p>But south of the Sahara, there could be 23 million cases of HIV infection; more than two out of three cases of Aids or HIV infection in the world are concentrated in one continent alone. Life expectancy in Africa had been rising until the nineties. Now it is falling, and in five years it will be back to where it was in 1945. As the average lifespan in Europe heads towards 80 years of comfort, the average lifespan in Africa heads back towards 40 years - because of Aids. </p> <p>\"When you spend your life dealing with disasters, you get used to big numbers. But when you start getting to the size of numbers we are talking about...\" says Walker. He starts again. \"A child aged 15 in Africa has a 50-50 chance of being infected by Aids. In Zambia, there are 1200 deaths a week from Aids. If that was from political riots, it would be headlines. If that was from famine, the C-130s would be flying. But they are not. In Zambia, again, the rate at which teachers are trained doesn't match the rate at which teachers are dying. Just think of the ramifications. The health system goes, the economies begin to shrink by 14 or 15%, because of Aids.\" </p> <p>Who got hit hardest in the Venezuelan floods last December? The poor in the shanty towns on the steep slopes. They live there because the land is not wanted by the rich. It is not wanted because it is unstable, but what choice have the poor got? Recently the World Bank quizzed 60,000 poor people and asked them what poverty meant for them. The biggest factor was poor health. </p> <p>\"It is not about income. If I had my health, I could work, I could support my family,\" says Walker. People could recover from disaster if they had some control over their own health - if they had health educa tion, reliable advice, clean water and nutrition. That is what public health is about. </p> <p>\"If you know what makes you healthy, if you know you have a disease then you have a chance; you can start to do something about it. If you don't know, you can't. In Africa, it is estimated that something like 90% of the people who have Aids don't know they have got it. All the drug therapy in the world is worth spit if you don't know you have got the disease: you won't get treated. So if we don't turn the way we regard health, and look at public health issues, this problem is going to get bigger.\" </p> <p> \u2022 World Disasters Report 2000, Red Cross (\u00a315.95)</p>",

This death toll was the worst since 1991, when a single cyclone swept over Bangladesh and killed 139,000, and a series of cholera epidemics took 19,000 lives in Africa. Last year, floods in Venezuela claimed 30,000 lives when a hillside collapsed and took the shanty towns with it. It was a particularly destructive year in a destructive decade, ironically declared by the UN to be the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction: ironic because there were more disasters, more deaths and greater economic damage at the end of the decade than the beginning. But the sum of these things, each appalling on its own, was nothing compared to the real catastrophe, says Peter Walker, director of disaster policy at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in Geneva. The real disaster was not that 80,000 died from natural calamity. It was that in the same year 30 million died from entirely preventable diseases. \"I have just had a colleague come back from the Sumatra earthquake. It was a huge earthquake in geological terms, and hit a very undeveloped area of Indonesia. But when he gets there, the actual damage from the earthquake isn't that great; the houses are wooden structures so they don't collapse much. But what he found was an endemic problem of rampant malaria, rampant communicable diseases and levels of mortality and morbidity that are totally unacceptable. That is the disaster, not the earthquake.\" North Korea is billed as a food emergency, says Walker. But the chronic stunting of children was caused not by hunger this year, but by repeated, year-by-year health problems. North Korea used to be fine: cradle-to-grave security, a doctor for every 134 families and a state which had eradicated tuberculosis. Now there are 40,000 new cases of TB a year, people are giving themselves diarrhoea by eating corn husks and grass to stave off famine and to keep the hospitals warm, the medical staff have had to scrape soot from the chimneys and burn it again. People who are sick cannot work. People who cannot work cannot feed themselves or their families. People who are not well-fed cannot get better. Poverty and ill health stalk each other, and sick nations end up with sick governments which have been spending up to 50 times as much on military hardware as they do on disease control. Since 1945 a total of 23 million people have been killed in war. But 150 million have been killed by just three infectious diseases: Aids, malaria and tuberculosis. Since the nuclear reactor at Chernobyl blew up 14 years ago, thyroid cancer figures are rising and deformities have risen 83% in the most contaminated areas of Belarus. Two million people in the region - including 500,000 children - lack adequate health care. \"Those are the real disasters and tackling them isn't done by firefighting. In many ways we at the Red Cross have got to change our arsenal. It is no longer good enough to have the commando troops, we have got to have the infantry on the ground - our volunteers - and they have got to start working in a way that is much more programmed,\" says Walker. The African Red Cross and Red Crescent societies sat down with government health ministries, Unicef, the World Health Organisation. They came up with a set of 20 things that could be done in the community, and which could be bankrolled for 10 years rather than one or two. They were simple things that Red Cross volunteers could tackle: clean water, nutrition advice, hygiene education, and vaccination against the great child-killing diseases. But south of the Sahara, there could be 23 million cases of HIV infection; more than two out of three cases of Aids or HIV infection in the world are concentrated in one continent alone. Life expectancy in Africa had been rising until the nineties. Now it is falling, and in five years it will be back to where it was in 1945. As the average lifespan in Europe heads towards 80 years of comfort, the average lifespan in Africa heads back towards 40 years - because of Aids. \"When you spend your life dealing with disasters, you get used to big numbers. But when you start getting to the size of numbers we are talking about...\" says Walker. He starts again. \"A child aged 15 in Africa has a 50-50 chance of being infected by Aids. In Zambia, there are 1200 deaths a week from Aids. If that was from political riots, it would be headlines. If that was from famine, the C-130s would be flying. But they are not. In Zambia, again, the rate at which teachers are trained doesn't match the rate at which teachers are dying. Just think of the ramifications. The health system goes, the economies begin to shrink by 14 or 15%, because of Aids.\" Who got hit hardest in the Venezuelan floods last December? The poor in the shanty towns on the steep slopes. They live there because the land is not wanted by the rich. It is not wanted because it is unstable, but what choice have the poor got? Recently the World Bank quizzed 60,000 poor people and asked them what poverty meant for them. The biggest factor was poor health. \"It is not about income. If I had my health, I could work, I could support my family,\" says Walker. People could recover from disaster if they had some control over their own health - if they had health educa tion, reliable advice, clean water and nutrition. That is what public health is about. \"If you know what makes you healthy, if you know you have a disease then you have a chance; you can start to do something about it. If you don't know, you can't. In Africa, it is estimated that something like 90% of the people who have Aids don't know they have got it. All the drug therapy in the world is worth spit if you don't know you have got the disease: you won't get treated. So if we don't turn the way we regard health, and look at public health issues, this problem is going to get bigger.\" \u2022 World Disasters Report 2000, Red Cross (\u00a315.95)",

Dogs spending the night with their owners will be able to relax with a \"personal pooch massage\" at $60 (\u00a340) an hour or \"aromatherapy grooming\" for $35. They can also take advantage of the \"quadruped community centre\" where single dogs will be able to interact. Organic dog food will be served to help that difficult unwinding process at the end of the day. And each animal with an owner willing to spend $189 for the night will be entitled to a \"keepsake signature bowl and bone\". If the dogs want to explore the area near Sunset Boulevard, seasonal collars - leather in winter, fabric in summer - are available and they will be able to visit the nearby Chateau Marmutt's day-care centre, where \"lonely pets can fend off separation anxiety for a few hours\". A hotel spokeswoman explained: \"It's furnished with brightly coloured plastic accoutrements: a fire hydrant, a pool, a picnic table - the room is essentially a quadruped community centre.\" The inherent threats to stars relaxing had been taken account of, she added. \"Candidates have to be neutered and all of them are carefully screened to weed out bullies.\" Dogs who have had star parts in films have stayed at the hotel during their shooting schedules. Frankie, who was in both Armageddon and Mr Magoo, spent the long months of filming relaxing in the hotel. Dogs in downtown LA must look on enviously; strays there have been rounded up to be \"euthanised\" in advance of the Democratic party's convention in the city next month, since it was thought that wild packs of feral creatures might alarm out-of-towners. Le Montrose hotel already prides itself on being \"Los Angeles's only luxurious and discreet hotel hideaway for post-cosmetic surgery care\". That service includes private underground entry and transport to and from the doctor's. Presumably, dogs seeking to perk up floppy ears or sagging tums will be offered the same facility. As it happens, the creatures that are currently wowing Hollywood are the animated hens from the successful film Chicken Run. As yet there is not a hotel offering them a special deal, but surely some enterprising hotelier might want to guarantee relaxation to any movie hen tired of the film business and of always being considered an easy lay.",

The prime minister of Ukraine, Viktor Yushchenko, told a press conference afterwards that \"expectations have been surpassed\". Germany's foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, said he expected that the shortfall could be raised at a third donor conference. The former Swedish foreign minister Hans Blix, who was appointed to run the fund, added that the precise amount needed would depend on exchange rate fluctuations and the cost of the work remaining. Nothing like it has been attempted before, so companies on the site were operating at the frontiers of nuclear engineering knowledge, Mr Blix said. \"They will have to learn as they go along, and that makes for a lot of additional difficulties,\" he told the Guardian. Work began last year on the concrete tomb to isolate fully the molten, intensely radioactive material still in its core. A vent stack which was in danger of collapsing on to the sarcophagus has been made safe, and beams in the roof were strengthened, but the biggest share of the work - providing support for some of the walls - has yet to begin. Despite the completion date of 2005 for the reconstructed Chernobyl \"shelter\", Mr Blix said work might not be finished until 2007. He expected the new structure to hold good for \"a number of decades\". After that, an attempt could be made to extract and store the radioactive material inside it. The entombment project is only part of the overall cost of closing down Chernobyl. It has been estimated that constructing waste storage facilities and building power stations to replace lost output from the site could run to $2bn. Ukraine, which is in the throes of an energy crisis, depends on Chernobyl's last remaining reactor for 6-8% of its energy needs. Last month the country's president, Leonid Kuchma, announced that it would be closed on December 15, though he later made clear that this was because it was close to exceeding all safety limits. To the dismay of environmental campaigners, two new nuclear reactors are being built in Ukraine to replace the Chernobyl plant. Critics have argued that rehabilitating conventional power stations would be safer and no more expensive. The issue is expected to dominate talks in Leipzig next week between the German and Ukrainian governments. Mr Trittin, a member of the Green party, which last month pushed Germany into phasing out its own nuclear energy programme, said that he would continue to press for coal- or gas-fired power plants. useful links: Uranium Institute of London: Chernobyl information Chernobyl links",

A bomb estimated to comprise about 2.25kg (5lbs) of explosives destroyed several rooms at the attorney general's office on Tuesday night. Another, twice as big, was found in the building yesterday before it went off. Jakarta's financial markets, already jolted by regional unrest, a barely functioning government and a very public spat between the President Abdurrahman Wahid and the legislature, tumbled yesterday. The currency, the rupiah, fell 5% to a 16-month low against the US dollar. No one was injured in the first blast, which happen an hour after prosecutors finished questioning Gen Suharto's youngest son, Hutomo (Tommy) Mandala Putra. The national police chief, General Rusdihardjo, said the terror tactics were \"clearly political and not criminal in nature\", but he added that there was not yet sufficient evidence to link the blast directly to the former president, who is the subject of several corruption investigations. Brigadier-General Erwin Map, the head of the Indonesian police forensics department, said after inspecting the device yesterday that the bombs were made by professionals. He dismissed suggestions that this was the start of a bombing campaign against the whole government. The attorney general, Marzuki Darusman, said he would not be affected by the threat. \"We cannot be deterred in our investigation of Suharto.\" But he added that security measures, both at his office and around him, would be increased immediately. Mr Darusman has promised to start court proceedings against Gen Suharto by the middle of next month. The current investigations are focused on the accumulation of wealth by six charitable foundations Gen Suharto used to control, and the distribution of their assets. Mr Wahid said last month that he reckoned that Gen Suharto had stolen about \u00a330bn while in office. He has repeatedly said that he will pardon Gen Suharto if he returns the stolen money. Three weeks ago Gen Suharto lost a libel suit against the American news magazine Time, which alleged that he amassed a fortune of about \u00a327bn while in office. He has lodged an appeal. His lawyers say the 79-year-old general is too ill to stand trial, although an independent team of doctors has declared him fit for investigation. Among those also being investigated are his six children; Mohammad \"Bob\" Hasan, one of his closest cronies; and the governor of the central bank, Sjahril Sabirin. The last two are in detention at the attorney general's office. Many analysts believe the bombs are part of a more widespread attempt to undermine Mr Wahid and destabilise the country before a crucial parliamentary session next month, when the president will have to account for his first 10 months in office. The main element of the destabilisation campaign is a resurgence of Islamic militancy, particularly in the Moluccas, where more than 3,000 people have been killed in 18 months of sectarian fighting. Radical Islamic groups from Java and Sumatra, with outside help, have begun a massive offensive in recent weeks in the area, known historically as as the Spice Islands. Mr Wahid has not helped his own cause, however. His constant vacillation over key issues has led to an almost complete policy paralysis, both in central government and at the provincial level. A western banker in Jakarta said yesterday: \"There is no good news out there at the moment, and lots of negative sentiment. \"In the short term things are probably going to get worse.\"",

      "body": "<p>In 1940, five weeks after the Dunkirk evacuation, the remnant of the Czechoslovak army which had been formed in France arrived in England and was inspected by Winston Churchill. The prime minister stopped in front of one of the young soldiers, Franta Belsky, who had been operating with a horse-drawn artillery battery that had survived from the first world war.</p> <p>Belsky, who has died aged 79, recalled that Churchill looked him in the eye for what seemed an age, chin thrust out, hat in hand, leaning on his stick. \"You wait,\" Belsky said to himself, \"one day I shall model a statue of you, just like this\".</p> <p>The day came in 1968, when Belsky completed his statue of Churchill for Fulton, Missouri, where the statesman had made his \"iron curtain\" speech in 1946. In 1988 the then Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, stood near the statue and, commenting that \"the sculptor of this statue expressed the spirit of wartime England,\" announced the end of the cold war.</p> <p>Born in Brno, Czechoslovakia, Belsky was a major force in British sculpture. He sculpted portrait busts of four generations of royalty, the Queen Mother (for the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham), the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Andrew (as a baby and as a young man) and the three-and-a-half-year-old Prince William. He has five works - including three of the royal family - in the National Portrait Gallery, and 15 public sculptures in central London.</p> <p>He was the first foreign-born sculptor to be commissioned for a work in Trafalgar Square, where Prince Philip unveiled a bust of Admiral Cunningham in 1970. His statue of Lord Mountbatten stands on Horse Guards Parade and his bust of Lord Cottesloe is in the National Theatre.</p> <p>But his work is not invariably about, and for, the great and occasionally good of the nation. His sculpture of a mother carrying her child in the Town Square, Stevenage, is a burst of joyous action. Like the 30ft Shell Fountain on the South Bank, it is listed as a Grade II sculpture to be preserved even if, as in the case of the fountain, the building it was commissioned for is no longer in use.</p> <p>These pieces and many others, including his Triga (three rearing horses in Knightsbridge), the Totem in the Arndale Centre, Manchester, and a delightful owl and pussycat on the wall of an infant school in Baldock, Herts, all demonstrate Belsky's conviction that sculpture was not for the elite but for the delight of the general public.</p> <p>\"You have to humanise the environment,\" he said. \"A housing estate does not only need newspaper kiosks and bus-stop shelters but something that gives it spirit.\"</p> <p>He did that at Stevenage, where his mother and child spread their arms against nearby trees and mirror their soaring spirit. With the Shell Fountain, \"I thought of whirlpools and stagnant pools, of rivulets and brooks; of streams and eddies. I began by looking at shells and listening to Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor... I realised that what I wanted to do was to evolve a sculptural counterpart for the form of Bach's music.\"</p> <p>He was never associated with any particular gallery or dealer, believing that younger artists in particular were often exploited. He himself kept free of any connection that might intrude on, or distort, the relationship between the sculptor and the space.</p> <p>For many years he exhibited at the Royal Academy. Then, at his peak, the selection committee started rejecting his work. The crucial point was reached when the Queen offered to lend him her own cast of the infant William to submit to the Academy. The Academy turned it down, along with two other portrait busts. \"Sour grapes,\" Belsky said. \"They were trying to slow me down.\"</p> <p>Belsky spent his boyhood in Prague where, at the age of 16, he won first prize in a student sculpture exhibition. He went to art school despite the opposition of his father, an eminent economist. This was replaced by graver concerns when the family sought refuge in England the following year, 1939.</p> <p>When war broke out, Belsky volunteered for the Czech army. When his unit returned from France to Cholmondeley Park, Cheshire, he carved a memorial stone that marked the Czechoslovak fighting presence on British soil. Subsequently, it was the apparent reason for a mention in despatches, \"ridiculous in this context,\" he would say, reluctantly admitting that there was \"a bit more to it.\" He became impatient when pressed.</p> <p>Another mention, in France in 1944, was linked with his getting the Czech bravery award for repairing a manual telephone line while under constant fire \"in conjunction with some other unpleasantness that I survived,\" he would say, refusing to be drawn. \"All faded now,\" he snapped, \"I just had incredible luck.\"</p> <p>After the war, he returned to Czechoslovakia with his wife, Margaret Constance Owen, whom he had met at the Royal College of Art during an extraordinary two terms he was allowed to spend there as a student between the fall of France and the Normandy invasion. A gifted cartoonist, Margaret died in 1989.</p> <p>In post-war Czechoslovakia Belsky discovered that 22 relations on his Jewish father's side had been killed by the Nazis. His 82-year-old grandmother's body was found dead on the railway embankment not far from her home. He and Margaret left Czechoslovakia in 1948, when the Russians effectively took over the country, but not before he had created the Paratroop Memorial in Prague (1947) and a medal to mark the achievements of the Czech athlete, Emil Zatopek.</p> <p>On his return there 42 years later he created the Prague memorial to Czechoslovaks who had served with the Royal Air Force, and the statue of Churchill outside the British Embassy. In 1999 the Czech president, Vaclav Havel, gave Belsky, who holds the rank of colonel (Rtd) in the Czech army, the Presidential Medal of Merit.</p> <p>Second only to sculpture was Belsky's love of skiing, in which he was - until a debilitating cancer forced him off the slopes - both daring and expert. So constant was his devotion to Zermatt that the town gave him a badge which allowed him priority access to the ski-lifts. Spotting it, an Englishman demanded to know who he was and what the badge was for. Belsky found his questioning intrusive, but his interrogator was insistent. \"Is it for climbing?\" the Englishman eventually demanded. \"No,\" Belsky told the late Alan Clark, MP, \" even for social climbing.\"</p> <p>He was a long-serving member of the Royal Society of British Sculptors' council, and a governor of St Martins School of Art from 1967 to 1988, when he resigned in protest against the consolidation of London's art colleges.

If you had asked me 50 years ago what I thought of my prospects of living to the turn of the century I would have said they were minimal. I've survived Hitler and the fall of France, sniper's bullets that passed within inches of my head and a 6-inch shell which landed a yard away and failed to explode. I was sketching a battlefield in France and a shell blew off the top of the hillock where I had been sitting, seconds after I left. I have survived a 600 metre fall in an avalanche near Zermatt.

The newspaper quoted Mechan's lawyer as saying his client planned to appeal against the sentence in September. Mechan denied manslaughter, saying he acted in self-defence. The paper said Marshall Earl Emmons, 31, a fibre-optics engineer from Tucson, Arizona, was knifed at a housing compound in Bahrain during a visit to the island state in January. Mr Emmons, who had been working in the Saudi Arabian eastern province city of al-Khobar, was on his way to Amsterdam at the time, his family were quoted as saying. Mechan also worked in al-Khobar and was on holiday in Bahrain at the time of the stabbing. Reuters",

      "bodyText": "Directors of an independent brewing company have defended a decision to name their flagship pub after a Welsh separatist leader who was jailed for public order offences on the eve of Prince Charles's investiture as Prince of Wales more than 30 years ago. When Cardiff's former Apollo Hotel reopens tomorrow after a refit, it will do so as the Cayo Arms, in memory of the late Julian Cayo Evans, the self-styled commandant of the Free Wales Army. Brewers Tomos Watkin, the pub's owners, say the decision to name the pub after the public school-educated separatist reflects the company's policy of commemorating famous and \"colourful\" personalities from Wales's past. But the move has been condemned by Conservative assembly members. Jonathan Morgan, AM for South Wales Central, said Wales should not be honouring people who broke the law in the name of patriotism. \"The disruptive antics of Welsh nationalists should be consigned to the dustbin,\" he said yesterday. Evans, the Millfield-educated son of a former high sheriff of Cardiganshire, served with the British army in Malaya during the 1950s but played a leading part in establishing the FWA after his return to Wales. He was sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment for public order offences after a special branch crackdown on the organisation before the 1969 Caernarvon investiture. He died five years ago, at 57, and was given a paramilitary funeral by FWA colleagues. Tomos Watkin's managing director, Simon Buckley, who knew Evans well, said: \"He was a Robin Hood character of the late 1960s.\"",

They keep playing Championship Manager, of course. But the ones who want a break could do worse than try the latest edition of International Cricket Captain, endorsed by Nasser Hussain. </p> <p>ICC2000 puts the emphasis on captaincy rather than management, though it does include picking the team, negotiating contracts and training youngsters. However, the main aim is to let you play through one-day, county and international matches ball by ball. This isn't an action game, but you can tell players how aggressively (or how defensively) to play. You can set a line and length for bowlers to follow, and either set standard fields or design your own. </p> <p>Like the real thing, this takes a long time. Fortunately you can skip the graphics, or just watch highlights (such as when a wicket falls), and get through more games in what might be called scorecard mode. One mouse-click can either represent a single ball or an over. If you're really in a hurry, you can click \"Skip game\" and let the computer calculate the result. </p> <p>Player statistics are based on Wisden's Cricket Almanac, and teams are commendably up to date. However, there are some \"historical scenarios\" that let you replay classic test series or last year's World Cup. ICC2000 also provides a two-player game, and will support online play when the server comes online. </p> <p>The game is mouse-driven and the polished interface makes it very easy to play. It also seems very fair. Active management generally seems to produce good results, or at least palliates the inevitable disasters. Even repeatedly skipping games does not seem to be a barrier to success. </p> <p>All in all, ICC2000 is an outstanding game for cricket fans, especially those who follow the English county game. </p> <p>Unfortunately this is a limited market, even by international cricket standards. What the game lacks is the introductory tutorial and background information that might help bring it the wider audience it deserves. (JS)</p> <p><strong> Fiendishly clever but not enough<br> Diablo II</strong> <br>PC \u00a329.99 Blizzard **** <br> There are some people out there who have the temerity to assert that Diablo - that's the original Diablo, released in 1996 - is still the best role-playing game on the market. Despite Might &amp; Magic, Fallout and Ultima. </p> <p>Most of these people, of course, also believe that the sun revolves around the earth. But the real question is: if the first game won so fanatical a following, can its sequel become the champion of RPGs? Well, no, but not for want of trying. </p> <p>The setup and interface are still recognisably Diabolical, except for the fact that it has incorporated all the advances in the RPG world and a few more to boot. There are five character classes instead of three, 3D support, shadows, weather and water effects, cheatproof multiplayer support, and some innovative new skills and enemies (anyone ever use a corpse explosion on a scarab demon before?). </p> <p>Not only do you get different maps and non-player-character responses with each class, but because of the nature of the interface, you'll find yourself developing totally different keyboard techniques for barbarian, amazon, paladin, necromancer and sorceress. </p> <p>Left-click for melee attack and right for ranged might suit one character, but assigning left-click to spells and switching between them might be a better option for another. </p> <p>Then there are the little touches, the sort that make you curse other programmers for being so lazy. Rats that flock to feed off the corpses of your vanquished opponents, only to scatter when you turn back. Chickens that squawk and flutter out of your way when you walk into them. Zombies that moan differently according to the extent of their injuries. </p> <p>Moments such as these make the opening chapters of Diablo II a delight. </p> <p>Only when you're some way into the game do the design flaws start to get to you. Stingy inventory space means you're heading back home every 10 minutes to sell off your excess baggage. Customised options revert to default every time you start a game. Creatures that hit obstacles spin crazily instead of standing still. The control system becomes more and more cumbersome, the more skills you learn. And the way that characters often face in a different direction from the way they're walking, creating a sort of diagonal- moonwalking effect, is just sloppy. </p> <p>One flaw smarts from the start: the lack of save slots. Sure, you can save and exit, but thanks to the perennial autosaves, you can't save and reload. This is no biggie from the death point of view: you die, you're resurrected in town, you go back and pick up your stuff. But the save facility is not just there for death. It's there for moments when you accidentally spend all your hard-earned cash on a useless weapon, or spend an experience point on the wrong skill, which can ruin a game right up to the end. </p> <p>The saving disgrace aside, Diablo II's drawbacks are mostly minor. But they're enough to ensure that Baldur's Gate hangs on to its RPG crown. (AB)</p> <p> <strong> Dastardly does down Disney</strong></p> <p><strong> Wacky Races</strong> <br> Dreamcast **** Infogrames \u00a339.99 </p> <p><strong> Walt Disney Magical Racing Tour</strong></p> <p> Sony Playstation ** Eidos \u00a329.99 <br> Often imitated but never bettered is one way to describe Nintendo's classic racing game, Mario Kart. </p> <p>However, the fat plumber's reign may be coming to an end with the release of Wacky Races. Continuing the recent 70's revival -Dukes of Hazzard, and the Muppets have appeared in games -Wacky Races breaks the standard inverse relationship between quality and license by actually being cracking fun. </p> <p>Graphically the game is a beauty, with the Hanna Barbera look captured expertly by the Dreamcast. Very much like Diddy Kong Racing, Wacky Races sets you a variety of karting challenges. Win race, gain stars, gain access to new track is the general rule, though if you get stuck on one course, you can quickly try a challenge on another. </p> <p>The game will really appeal to those who remember Penelope Pitstop, the Anthill Gang and the rest but, frustratingly, the real heroes, Dastardly and Muttley, are available to play only when a large proportion of the game has been completed. </p> <p>Surely as cruel a denial as any half-baked plan they may have hatched on TV. Thank fully there are no such problems in this months other kart release, Walt Disney Magical Racing Tour. Despite the licence the characters are strictly C list, with the likes of Chip 'n' Dale offering little incentive to persevere on some surprisingly tough circuits. A Goofy or a Mickey would have helped, and while the Disneyland visuals will appeal to the juvenile target audience, Wacky Races is by far the better game. </p> <p>It seems Mario may finally have met his match.

      "bodyText": "Pushing back the boundaries ICC2000 PC \u00a329.99 Empire **** What do Championship Manager players do during the summer? They keep playing Championship Manager, of course. But the ones who want a break could do worse than try the latest edition of International Cricket Captain, endorsed by Nasser Hussain. ICC2000 puts the emphasis on captaincy rather than management, though it does include picking the team, negotiating contracts and training youngsters. However, the main aim is to let you play through one-day, county and international matches ball by ball. This isn't an action game, but you can tell players how aggressively (or how defensively) to play. You can set a line and length for bowlers to follow, and either set standard fields or design your own. Like the real thing, this takes a long time. Fortunately you can skip the graphics, or just watch highlights (such as when a wicket falls), and get through more games in what might be called scorecard mode. One mouse-click can either represent a single ball or an over. If you're really in a hurry, you can click \"Skip game\" and let the computer calculate the result. Player statistics are based on Wisden's Cricket Almanac, and teams are commendably up to date. However, there are some \"historical scenarios\" that let you replay classic test series or last year's World Cup. ICC2000 also provides a two-player game, and will support online play when the server comes online. The game is mouse-driven and the polished interface makes it very easy to play. It also seems very fair. Active management generally seems to produce good results, or at least palliates the inevitable disasters. Even repeatedly skipping games does not seem to be a barrier to success. All in all, ICC2000 is an outstanding game for cricket fans, especially those who follow the English county game. Unfortunately this is a limited market, even by international cricket standards. What the game lacks is the introductory tutorial and background information that might help bring it the wider audience it deserves. (JS) Fiendishly clever but not enough Diablo II PC \u00a329.99 Blizzard **** There are some people out there who have the temerity to assert that Diablo - that's the original Diablo, released in 1996 - is still the best role-playing game on the market. Despite Might &amp; Magic, Fallout and Ultima. Most of these people, of course, also believe that the sun revolves around the earth. But the real question is: if the first game won so fanatical a following, can its sequel become the champion of RPGs? Well, no, but not for want of trying. The setup and interface are still recognisably Diabolical, except for the fact that it has incorporated all the advances in the RPG world and a few more to boot. There are five character classes instead of three, 3D support, shadows, weather and water effects, cheatproof multiplayer support, and some innovative new skills and enemies (anyone ever use a corpse explosion on a scarab demon before?). Not only do you get different maps and non-player-character responses with each class, but because of the nature of the interface, you'll find yourself developing totally different keyboard techniques for barbarian, amazon, paladin, necromancer and sorceress. Left-click for melee attack and right for ranged might suit one character, but assigning left-click to spells and switching between them might be a better option for another. Then there are the little touches, the sort that make you curse other programmers for being so lazy. Rats that flock to feed off the corpses of your vanquished opponents, only to scatter when you turn back. Chickens that squawk and flutter out of your way when you walk into them. Zombies that moan differently according to the extent of their injuries. Moments such as these make the opening chapters of Diablo II a delight. Only when you're some way into the game do the design flaws start to get to you. Stingy inventory space means you're heading back home every 10 minutes to sell off your excess baggage. Customised options revert to default every time you start a game. Creatures that hit obstacles spin crazily instead of standing still. The control system becomes more and more cumbersome, the more skills you learn. And the way that characters often face in a different direction from the way they're walking, creating a sort of diagonal- moonwalking effect, is just sloppy. One flaw smarts from the start: the lack of save slots. Sure, you can save and exit, but thanks to the perennial autosaves, you can't save and reload. This is no biggie from the death point of view: you die, you're resurrected in town, you go back and pick up your stuff. But the save facility is not just there for death. It's there for moments when you accidentally spend all your hard-earned cash on a useless weapon, or spend an experience point on the wrong skill, which can ruin a game right up to the end. The saving disgrace aside, Diablo II's drawbacks are mostly minor. But they're enough to ensure that Baldur's Gate hangs on to its RPG crown. (AB) Dastardly does down Disney Wacky Races Dreamcast **** Infogrames \u00a339.99 Walt Disney Magical Racing Tour Sony Playstation ** Eidos \u00a329.99 Often imitated but never bettered is one way to describe Nintendo's classic racing game, Mario Kart. However, the fat plumber's reign may be coming to an end with the release of Wacky Races. Continuing the recent 70's revival -Dukes of Hazzard, and the Muppets have appeared in games -Wacky Races breaks the standard inverse relationship between quality and license by actually being cracking fun. Graphically the game is a beauty, with the Hanna Barbera look captured expertly by the Dreamcast. Very much like Diddy Kong Racing, Wacky Races sets you a variety of karting challenges. Win race, gain stars, gain access to new track is the general rule, though if you get stuck on one course, you can quickly try a challenge on another. The game will really appeal to those who remember Penelope Pitstop, the Anthill Gang and the rest but, frustratingly, the real heroes, Dastardly and Muttley, are available to play only when a large proportion of the game has been completed. Surely as cruel a denial as any half-baked plan they may have hatched on TV. Thank fully there are no such problems in this months other kart release, Walt Disney Magical Racing Tour. Despite the licence the characters are strictly C list, with the likes of Chip 'n' Dale offering little incentive to persevere on some surprisingly tough circuits. A Goofy or a Mickey would have helped, and while the Disneyland visuals will appeal to the juvenile target audience, Wacky Races is by far the better game. It seems Mario may finally have met his match. (GH)",

      "body": "<p> Bill Gates, talking in Asia recently, made a point about the future of user interfaces and the limitations of keyboards and screens. One obvious interface is speech. The idea of talking to a computer rather than typing, pointing, pressing or touching it in any way is not only embedded in our shared cultural vision of the future (remember HAL?) but makes sense because it is so natural to us as a way of communicating. </p> <p> Following this line of thinking would lead one to suspect that voice-enabled e-commerce (ie, v-commerce) will become a common way to do business on line: the question is when? It may not be so far away. The medium being the message, and all that, the greater part of this article was in fact dictated to my Macintosh laptop through IBM's splendid ViaVoice package. </p> <p> I estimate that the machine got the words right about 95% of the time: not perfect, by any means, but still a very convenient way to get some work done while both hands are otherwise occupied (looking through relevant doc uments, making a few notes and so on). So voice recognition is starting to work, but how will it combine with the net? There is already a standard for accessing web sites through the telephone (it's known as VoiceXML, or VXML) and there are already companies offering, or planning to offer, services in this area. </p> <p> The VoiceXML Forum, which was founded by AT&amp;T, IBM, Lucent Technologies and Motorola recently completed Version 1.0 of the VoiceXML specification, which aims to make content more accessible via voice commands and \"traditional\" phone interfaces. Services like this mean that people will be able to follow up a web site and navigate their way through to find the information that they want using voice commands, and then have the information spoken back to them. How ever, navigating through vast amounts of information to find specific items probably works better through a web browser and large screen. </p> <p> Where the use of voice interfaces comes into its own is in this field of remote transactions. Phoning a bank to find an account balance or to initiate a bill payment is the perfect example. </p> <p> At the heart of v-commerce are two rapidly evolving technologies: natural language speech recognition and speaker authentication.

      "bodyText": "Bill Gates, talking in Asia recently, made a point about the future of user interfaces and the limitations of keyboards and screens. One obvious interface is speech. The idea of talking to a computer rather than typing, pointing, pressing or touching it in any way is not only embedded in our shared cultural vision of the future (remember HAL?) but makes sense because it is so natural to us as a way of communicating. Following this line of thinking would lead one to suspect that voice-enabled e-commerce (ie, v-commerce) will become a common way to do business on line: the question is when? It may not be so far away. The medium being the message, and all that, the greater part of this article was in fact dictated to my Macintosh laptop through IBM's splendid ViaVoice package. I estimate that the machine got the words right about 95% of the time: not perfect, by any means, but still a very convenient way to get some work done while both hands are otherwise occupied (looking through relevant doc uments, making a few notes and so on). So voice recognition is starting to work, but how will it combine with the net? There is already a standard for accessing web sites through the telephone (it's known as VoiceXML, or VXML) and there are already companies offering, or planning to offer, services in this area. The VoiceXML Forum, which was founded by AT&amp;T, IBM, Lucent Technologies and Motorola recently completed Version 1.0 of the VoiceXML specification, which aims to make content more accessible via voice commands and \"traditional\" phone interfaces. Services like this mean that people will be able to follow up a web site and navigate their way through to find the information that they want using voice commands, and then have the information spoken back to them. How ever, navigating through vast amounts of information to find specific items probably works better through a web browser and large screen. Where the use of voice interfaces comes into its own is in this field of remote transactions. Phoning a bank to find an account balance or to initiate a bill payment is the perfect example. At the heart of v-commerce are two rapidly evolving technologies: natural language speech recognition and speaker authentication. These will, in the medium term, make it possible for users to complete transactions all the way through from initial inquiries to giving payment details. A voice recognition system would not have to be that comprehensive to satisfy these requirements. All it has to do is recognize that you are asking it to pay a bill and then present you with a list of pre-configured ways to pay (eg, \"press 3 for Visa\") to make it useful. Recognition technology is coming along nicely and some mobile operators already have voice-recognition systems for customers to dial phone numbers or access voicemail messages (eg Orange's Wildfire) just by talking.

When I buy a CD I pay for all of the above, fair enough. But by doing so I have bought the right to listen to the music, so why should I pay again to listen to the same music in a different format? Antony Hawkins a.d.hawkins@sheffield.ac.uk As a musician I find Roy Emerson's attitude towards downloading music rather disconcerting. I am fully in support of music for everyone, irrespective of whether we are paid for it. For far too many years musicians have been the pawns of the record industry fat cats. I will welcome the downfall of the current regime where record bosses with no musical creativity take a big cut from those that actually create the records. MP3s can still be security keyed and so in effect the songs will always remain the property of the creator. The internet has opened up a vast market for individuals like myself and I am very grateful. Andy Lucas AndyRLucas@aol.com",

So at a time when the profile of Test cricket has been stimulated in scintillating fashion by England's win at Lord's and the public is clamouring for the next round, it is off with the whites and on with the motley for the next two weeks as England, West Indies and Zimbabwe play a 10-match triangular one-day series. </p> <p>No blame to the England and Wales Cricket Board for their applecart being upturned by such an unforeseen event as a Test home win. For some years now, England have taken part in three- and four-nation tournaments the world over while ignoring at home, in summers with split tours, what is an obvious, not to say money-spinning, overlap. </p> <p>Today's floodlit opener between West Indies and Zimbabwe at Bristol - very much \"weather permitting\" - launches a round-robin in which each side plays the others three times apiece before the top two meet in a final at Lord's on Saturday fortnight. </p> <p>Two other matches besides today's - England v Zimbabwe at Old Trafford on July 13 and again at Edgbaston five days later - will finish under lights, a novelty for internationals in this country. </p> <p>This is an opportunity for England to reinforce the impression they made on West Indies at Lord's and gain further psychological advantage before the third Test at Old Trafford on August 3. The omens are good, for in the last three one-day series played here between the sides, England have won eight and lost just once, by five wickets, at Trent Bridge five years ago. </p> <p>The England selectors made the clearest possible statement of their intent to put future planning on hold by selecting a squad of 14, only four of whom are under the age of 30. Injuries to the captain Nasser Hussain and Nick Knight necessitated the addition of Matthew Maynard and Marcus Trescothick, although it is hoped both crocks will be fit for the later stages. </p> <p>Andy Flintoff played yesterday but his England participation remains in the melting pot and Dominic Cork could yet get a call-up. Fit or not, though, there is already concern at the inadequate effort made by Flintoff to knock some bulk from his frame. </p> <p>The biggest opportunity awaits Nottinghamshire's all-rounder Paul Franks, who it is hoped will display the same burning passion as has Cork. </p> <p>The Zimbabweans, as ever, will be waiting to mug England as has happened in the past. The sides have met on a dozen occasions with the honours precisely even, although England have won five of the last six. Zimbabwe, in eight matches worldwide, have never beaten West Indies. </p> <p>\u0095 Marvan Atapattu's sixth successive one-day fifty against Pakistan steered the hosts Sri Lanka to a five-wicket win as the Singer triangular series started in Galle yesterday. The man of the match, the left-arm seamer Nuwan Zoysa, took a career-best four for 34 as Pakistan, sent in under overcast conditions, crashed to 53 for six before mustering 164 for eight. </p> <p> <strong> West Indies</strong> (from): Adams (capt), Griffith, Sarwan, Lara, Collymore, Gayle, Chanderpaul, Powell, Hinds, Jacobs, Reon, McLean, Nagamootoo, Rose, Walsh, Dillon. </p> <p><strong> Zimbabwe</strong> (from): A Flower (capt), Streak, Brent, Campbell, Carlisle, G Flower, Goodwin, Johnson, Mbwanga, Nkala, Olonga, B Strang, P Strang, Viljoen, Whittall, Wishart. </p> <p><strong> Triangular tournament fixtures:</strong> <strong> Today</strong> W Indies v Zimbabwe, Bristol (day/night) / <strong> July 8</strong> England v Zimbabwe, The Oval / <strong> July 9</strong> England v W Indies, Lord's / <strong> July 11</strong> W Indies v Zimbabwe, Canterbury / <strong> July 13</strong> England v Zimbabwe, Old Trafford (day/night) / <strong> July 15 </strong> England v W Indies, Chester-le-Street / <strong> July 16</strong> W Indies v Zimbabwe, Chester-le-Street / <strong> July 18 </strong> England v Zimbabwe, Edgbaston (day/night) / <strong> July 20 </strong> England v W Indies, Trent Bridge / <strong> July 22 </strong> Final, Lord's.</p>",

No blame to the England and Wales Cricket Board for their applecart being upturned by such an unforeseen event as a Test home win. For some years now, England have taken part in three- and four-nation tournaments the world over while ignoring at home, in summers with split tours, what is an obvious, not to say money-spinning, overlap. Today's floodlit opener between West Indies and Zimbabwe at Bristol - very much \"weather permitting\" - launches a round-robin in which each side plays the others three times apiece before the top two meet in a final at Lord's on Saturday fortnight. Two other matches besides today's - England v Zimbabwe at Old Trafford on July 13 and again at Edgbaston five days later - will finish under lights, a novelty for internationals in this country. This is an opportunity for England to reinforce the impression they made on West Indies at Lord's and gain further psychological advantage before the third Test at Old Trafford on August 3. The omens are good, for in the last three one-day series played here between the sides, England have won eight and lost just once, by five wickets, at Trent Bridge five years ago. The England selectors made the clearest possible statement of their intent to put future planning on hold by selecting a squad of 14, only four of whom are under the age of 30. Injuries to the captain Nasser Hussain and Nick Knight necessitated the addition of Matthew Maynard and Marcus Trescothick, although it is hoped both crocks will be fit for the later stages. Andy Flintoff played yesterday but his England participation remains in the melting pot and Dominic Cork could yet get a call-up. Fit or not, though, there is already concern at the inadequate effort made by Flintoff to knock some bulk from his frame. The biggest opportunity awaits Nottinghamshire's all-rounder Paul Franks, who it is hoped will display the same burning passion as has Cork. The Zimbabweans, as ever, will be waiting to mug England as has happened in the past. The sides have met on a dozen occasions with the honours precisely even, although England have won five of the last six. Zimbabwe, in eight matches worldwide, have never beaten West Indies. \u0095 Marvan Atapattu's sixth successive one-day fifty against Pakistan steered the hosts Sri Lanka to a five-wicket win as the Singer triangular series started in Galle yesterday. The man of the match, the left-arm seamer Nuwan Zoysa, took a career-best four for 34 as Pakistan, sent in under overcast conditions, crashed to 53 for six before mustering 164 for eight. West Indies (from): Adams (capt), Griffith, Sarwan, Lara, Collymore, Gayle, Chanderpaul, Powell, Hinds, Jacobs, Reon, McLean, Nagamootoo, Rose, Walsh, Dillon. Zimbabwe (from): A Flower (capt), Streak, Brent, Campbell, Carlisle, G Flower, Goodwin, Johnson, Mbwanga, Nkala, Olonga, B Strang, P Strang, Viljoen, Whittall, Wishart. Triangular tournament fixtures: Today W Indies v Zimbabwe, Bristol (day/night) / July 8 England v Zimbabwe, The Oval / July 9 England v W Indies, Lord's / July 11 W Indies v Zimbabwe, Canterbury / July 13 England v Zimbabwe, Old Trafford (day/night) / July 15 England v W Indies, Chester-le-Street / July 16 W Indies v Zimbabwe, Chester-le-Street / July 18 England v Zimbabwe, Edgbaston (day/night) / July 20 England v W Indies, Trent Bridge / July 22 Final, Lord's.",

All the characters will have gone except Dennis the Menace and Gnasher. Completely baffled, Dennis starts searching for his missing pals and eventually discovers them sitting in an internet caf\u00e9 where they are logged onto a new Beano web site. </p> <p>The comic's publisher, DC Thomson, is planning this high-profile PR stunt to announce the official launch of <a href=\"http://www.Beanotown.com\" target=\"_new\"> Beanotown.com</a>, a new online community designed for children. Populated by the likes of Minnie the Minx, Roger the Dodger and the Bash Street Kids, Beanotown is the latest attempt to make the traditional comic relevant to the fast-growing internet generation. The virtual town will replace the Beano's old web site and the publishers are hoping they can turn it into a major new e-commerce platform. </p> <p>It has taken six months to build Beanotown.com at a cost of about \u00a3500,000. The town square's home page leads you through to high street shops, a museum and the Bash Street School. To become a resident of Beanotown you pay an annual \u00a35 fee, which is deducted from a credit card. Then you can move into your own virtual house and decorate and furnish it how you wish. You can talk to other residents of Beanotown through email and you can choose to have a Beano character to lead you around and tell you jokes. </p> <p>\"Beanotown.com is not in any sense replacing the comic,\" explains DC Thomson's online manager, Ben Gray. \"They will feed off each other. The internet is helping us to broaden the appeal of the Beano into other areas which are not comic-related.\" </p> <p>A cartoon strip about life in Beanotown will run regularly in the comic and an online Beano bank as well as various educational products are already under serious consideration. It sounds far-fetched but the Bash Street Kids might even become part of the new curriculum to help teach school children how to behave as citizens. As part of the proposals, there would be references to illustrated examples of life in the new virtual town. Beano executives say you can teach children by showing them how not to do certain things. </p> <p>The Beano is practically a national institution. It first hit the news stands in 1938 and has chuckled and chortled forward despite television, video and computer games. In it's heyday it was selling about 2 million copies a week. Now it still manages about 210,000. </p> <p>The Beano's owners know it must embrace the online world. Gray believes the Beano would be stupid to ignore the growing appeal of the net and with kids' favourites such as Billy Whizz, the Three Bears and Dennis as some of the key attractions, he's confident that surfers will come in droves to the virtual town. </p> <p>The Beano has tried other media - there was a Dennis the Menace cartoon series on TV - but Gray feels the technology of the web is streets ahead of traditional television shows. \"With the internet you have the ability to give the children the opportunity not only of watching but of participating.\" </p> <p>DC Thomson executives are already developing an ambitious e-strategy for Beanotown.com. They believe they can use the new site to expand the UK-based comic internationally. Asked if there might for example be a Chinese version of Dennis the Menace, Gray says the site could be used to test and develop new characters. But the immediate priority is to stick to the English-speaking countries. The US is regarded as the best new market for the Beano to enter because there is clear evidence of an appetite among Americans for traditional British humour demonstrated by the success of shows such as Benny Hill, Monty Python and more recently Nick Park's box office success, Chicken Run. </p> <p>The comic's executives know it's important to build trust among parents in the UK before Beanotown.com can become a key destination for kids and a fully-fledged online retailer. To begin with visitors to Beanotown will be able to buy comic-related merchandise. Everything from T-shirts to whoopee cushions will be on sale. But the Beano's commercial team is talking to potential e-commerce partners including retailers and fast food companies. </p> <p> The Beanotown hairdresser (who presumably has to shear Gnasher's shaggy coat when it gets too hot) could even stock L'Oreal's kids' shampoo on the salon's shelves, says Gray. There are also discussions about linking up with eToys or Toys \"R\" Us to host online toy stores. </p> <p>E-commerce directors are dogged by complaints that they have so far failed to make any tangible profits. But DC Thomson's executives are confident Beanotown.com will soon become profitable. \"We should make a profit within one and a half years because we're so good at keeping costs down at the start. If we get two or three big advertising clients and build them into the fabric of the town that will be worth a fair amount of money - and that should not be too difficult,\" Gray explains. </p> <p>Beanotown was designed in-house and there are a team of six people working on it. Aside from this high-profile e-venture, which is officially launched in mid July, DC Thomson is also developing online sites for its other publications, which include regional newspapers. Last year the company generated about \u00a350,000 in online sales and figures are already reportedly up this year. </p> <p>Tanya Kreisky, editor of Internet magazine, thinks the idea of a safe community for children on the web could rejuvenate the comic - although the Beano faces stiff online competition from rivals such as the <a href=\"http://www.cartoonnetwork.com\" target=\"_new\">Cartoon Network</a> and <a href=\"http://www.disney.com\" target=\"_new\">Disney</a>. </p> <p>\"A lot of people look at the Beano nowadays and say it's dated,\" she says. \"This is a huge leap for a static printed product. It's a good example of the net offering something which the original product could not. The Beano might even become cool again.\" </p> <p>Dennis the Menace is a national cultural icon of sorts and the sight of him putting down his catapult, and heading off to an internet caf\u00e9 to become an e-entrepreneur will probably have some influence on general British attitudes to the web. </p> <p>While we adults tend to agonise over when and whether the so-called internet bubble is going to burst, the reality is the Beano-reading generation (seven-14 year olds) display no such doubts. Children are instinctively at ease with new technology. It might sound like harmless fun, but the new residents of Beanotown could eventually play a serious role in sustaining the long-term growth of the internet-based economy.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Last week the owners of Standard Life, one of the few remaining mutual financial institutions, decided not to turn it into a private company despite being promised a windfall of up to \u00a36,000 each. But while Standard Life will remain owned by its members and run for their mutual benefit instead of delivering profits to shareholders, the future of the worlds' biggest and most successful mutual undertaking looks far less certain. The internet, a co-operative enterprise with more than 300million \"members\" is in trouble. </p> <p>It may sound strange to claim that the internet is like the worker's co-op running your local health food shop, or the John Lewis Partnership. According to the International Co-operative Alliance a co-operative is \"an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly-owned and democratic-controlled enterprise\", and this does not seem to describe the net. </p> <p>For one thing, the many networks and computers that make the internet are not jointly owned: they are all in private hands. Perhaps when the net was just a government and academic network, and all the computers and cables were in public ownership, it might have been a co-operative of some sort, but that is certainly not true today. </p> <p>The internet is hardly democratically controlled, either, at least not on the one member, one vote model. In the early days it was managed by a beneficent oligarchy of technically-minded individuals who were either paid to research and develop computer networks or worked for companies that gave them time and space to be involved in the standards-setting process. Now it is dominated by the paid technical representatives of large corporations seeking to have their technologies and programs incorporated into the standards. </p> <p>But the computers and the networks are not really \"the internet\": the internet emerges when they are connected, in the space behind the screen. It is, as William Gibson put it, \"a graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system\". And the way the inter net's technical standards are set is still open to all who want to participate and not dominated by one company or group. </p> <p>This internet, like a mind inside a brain, is more than the hardware and software that support it. We all share in the net only as we contribute to it, adding our programs, computers and network links to the larger whole. We all accept the technical limitations on which software we can use, so that we can join our computers together. And we all benefit from the scale of today's internet. That makes it a co-op. </p> <p>But all is not well. The internet is like common land which can be used by everyone. As long as nobody takes too much of the land, or grazes too many sheep or cows, then everyone can benefit. However, the first person to graze too many sheep gets an immediate advantage, for one year at least: their sheep grow faster and they make more money. The end result is that the commons are destroyed, and everyone loses out. But the certain knowledge of long term disaster may not be enough to deter the first mover who sees a large short term gain. </p> <p>We can see this happening already with Linux, one of the internet's big success stories. For eight years the open source operating system created by Linus Torvalds in 1991 was worked on by thousands of programmers who wanted to contribute to the public good. But while the source is free, corporate users want to buy technical support for it, and a number of companies offering Linux services, such as Red Hat, have gone public with massively inflated share prices. </p> <p>As a result, the thousands of programmers who have contributed to Linux over the years are now asking where their share of the money is. The move to demutualise Linux, just as the building societies were demutualised, is just around the corner. And, as with the building societies and the banks, it will be the current owners - the few who own Linux-focused companies or whose programming made it into the latest distribution - who will benefit. Those who contributed in the early days, who worked to build the commons in the first place, will be forgotten as virtual fences are erected. </p> <p>It does not have to be that way. One of the most important things about the internet is that it has no limits. Unlike a physical field, it is always possible to add to the size of the net, simply by adding more computers and networks. The activities of the entrepreneurial capitalists do not have to affect the co-operative programming teams or the virtual communities, as long as all users respect the mutualist principles which made it all possible in the first place and created this \"dot.commons\" we all share. </p> <p>Support for the open standards on which the net is built is the most important of these principles, but the tension between working to standards and creating innovative software that creates new markets (and new commercial opportunities) is always great. Sometimes it breaks down, and we get the browser wars between Microsoft and Netscape, or the Instant Messaging battle between AOL and the rest of the world. Unfortunately, the initial profits for the standards-busting first movers can be so large companies have a great incentive to deviate from standards or introduce their own proprietary software in the hope that they will dominate the market. </p> <p>Keeping the internet mutual is important for two reasons.

      "bodyText": "Last week the owners of Standard Life, one of the few remaining mutual financial institutions, decided not to turn it into a private company despite being promised a windfall of up to \u00a36,000 each. But while Standard Life will remain owned by its members and run for their mutual benefit instead of delivering profits to shareholders, the future of the worlds' biggest and most successful mutual undertaking looks far less certain. The internet, a co-operative enterprise with more than 300million \"members\" is in trouble. It may sound strange to claim that the internet is like the worker's co-op running your local health food shop, or the John Lewis Partnership. According to the International Co-operative Alliance a co-operative is \"an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly-owned and democratic-controlled enterprise\", and this does not seem to describe the net. For one thing, the many networks and computers that make the internet are not jointly owned: they are all in private hands. Perhaps when the net was just a government and academic network, and all the computers and cables were in public ownership, it might have been a co-operative of some sort, but that is certainly not true today. The internet is hardly democratically controlled, either, at least not on the one member, one vote model. In the early days it was managed by a beneficent oligarchy of technically-minded individuals who were either paid to research and develop computer networks or worked for companies that gave them time and space to be involved in the standards-setting process. Now it is dominated by the paid technical representatives of large corporations seeking to have their technologies and programs incorporated into the standards. But the computers and the networks are not really \"the internet\": the internet emerges when they are connected, in the space behind the screen. It is, as William Gibson put it, \"a graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system\". And the way the inter net's technical standards are set is still open to all who want to participate and not dominated by one company or group. This internet, like a mind inside a brain, is more than the hardware and software that support it. We all share in the net only as we contribute to it, adding our programs, computers and network links to the larger whole. We all accept the technical limitations on which software we can use, so that we can join our computers together. And we all benefit from the scale of today's internet. That makes it a co-op. But all is not well. The internet is like common land which can be used by everyone. As long as nobody takes too much of the land, or grazes too many sheep or cows, then everyone can benefit. However, the first person to graze too many sheep gets an immediate advantage, for one year at least: their sheep grow faster and they make more money. The end result is that the commons are destroyed, and everyone loses out. But the certain knowledge of long term disaster may not be enough to deter the first mover who sees a large short term gain. We can see this happening already with Linux, one of the internet's big success stories. For eight years the open source operating system created by Linus Torvalds in 1991 was worked on by thousands of programmers who wanted to contribute to the public good. But while the source is free, corporate users want to buy technical support for it, and a number of companies offering Linux services, such as Red Hat, have gone public with massively inflated share prices. As a result, the thousands of programmers who have contributed to Linux over the years are now asking where their share of the money is. The move to demutualise Linux, just as the building societies were demutualised, is just around the corner. And, as with the building societies and the banks, it will be the current owners - the few who own Linux-focused companies or whose programming made it into the latest distribution - who will benefit. Those who contributed in the early days, who worked to build the commons in the first place, will be forgotten as virtual fences are erected. It does not have to be that way. One of the most important things about the internet is that it has no limits.

      "body": "<p>Even in the super-charged internet world, the BBC's dot.com juggernaut is gathering impressive pace. It could end today with a lorry load of evidence that it is miles ahead of the competition. </p> <p>In the <a href=\"http://www.net-media.co.uk/eolja/\" target=\"_new\">2000 European Online Journalism Awards</a>, to be presented tonight at the NetMedia conference at City University, London, the BBC is shortlisted in 14 of the 19 categories. Auntie could win gongs in everything from design to investigative reporting, via business and economics and music and entertainment. </p> <p>This comes only 10 days after the Henley Centre ranked the BBC top of the 10 most trusted websites in the UK. And it follows hard on the heels of Monday's unveiling of a revamped sports website, backed by funding of up to \u00a36m and 45 staff. That is almost as many staff as work on the hugely successful News Online stablemate, which has recently upped its profile even further by doing a deal with Yahoo!, the UK's second most popular website, to have its content displayed on the site's news pages. </p> <p>This appears to be a big success story: the BBC transferring its content on to the internet, building its brand online and gaining great respect around the world; 40% of BBC Online's traffic comes from overseas, although the UK traffic is still enough to rank it the 9th most popular site in the UK. </p> <p>But from the rest of the UK's online publishing industry come howls of protest. Commercial publishers say the BBC is steamrolling into areas already well served by the private sector, and using licence-fee money to snatch traffic away - even making it difficult for private sites to secure that oxygen of online business, venture capital. </p> <p>The British Internet Publishers' Alliance (Bipa), is leading criticism of the BBC's online drive. Bipa has submitted evidence to the Davies review of the future funding of the BBC, and the House of Commons' select committee on culture, media and sport last year, when it was considering the future of the BBC. </p> <p>Its argument was summed up by Bipa chairman and Daily Telegraph director, Sir Frank Rogers, in a letter to the Times in April. \"There is no case whatsoever,\" he wrote, \"for the BBC to use public money to become a major electronic publisher on the internet.\" </p> <p>The net, with its lower costs and already diverse content, did not need a public service organisation to drive wide take-up of internet services, said Rogers. He described the much touted notion of convergence, where TV, radio and internet content is delivered to consumers on a single device, as \"a seductive and misleading prediction\". </p> <p>It is not hard to see why privately funded internet publishers are afraid of the BBC moving into their patch. While the start-ups struggle to raise finance and discover the so-far elusive revenue streams, the BBC has no such concerns. BBC Online's \u00a332m budget last year came from the licence fee, and the site does not carry advertising or sponsorship. </p> <p>This week provided one of the best examples of the unfairness of the BBC's position, its detractors say. When the corporation decided to launch its new sports website, \u00a31.5m was found to set the new venture up, along with an annual budget of \u00a34-\u00a35m. With the sports website market already one of the most competitive in the UK net industry, it is unlikely a start-up would have been able to convince venture capitalists to part with that kind of money. </p> <p>Stephen Nuttall, head of sport at <a href=\"http://www.Sportal.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\"> Sportal.co.uk</a>, wryly points out that <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sport/\" target=\"_new\">BBC Sport Online's</a> spending money this year is more than his company's entire first round of funding. \"And that was to put up an international network of sports sites, not just the UK,\" he adds. </p> <p>Sportal scored a coup with its exclusive internet rights to Euro2000, and was named the best private internet company in Europe last weekend. But, says Nuttall, the BBC's renewed interest in online sport takes the gloss off his company's successes. The BBC has a big budget and, just importantly, it can cross-promote the online service on radio and television, he says. </p> <p>The BBC's determination to carve a niche in online sports will not make it an easy neighbour, he says. \"The world does not need another sports site. If someone was trying to raise venture capital for a sports start-up, I think that their business plan would be scrutinised very carefully indeed. Who is going to scrutinise the BBC's?\" </p> <p>According to Bipa, that scrutiny is badly needed to stop the BBC smothering newborn dot.coms with its own launches. Angela Mills, its secretary, says the BBC's public service role needs to be redefined. </p> <p>\"Nobody in Bipa is saying that the BBC has no place on the internet. We're not saying it should be kicked off,\" she says. \"It is just a question of making sure there are clear parameters between what is publicly funded and what falls within the private sector, and that proper rules apply in both.\" </p> <p>But is BIPA's case not built on vested interests and more than a hint of sour grapes? Even new media commentators based in the US are expected to say at NetMedia today that the BBC supplies a news service which matches, even outstrips, the best of what is on offer from the States. </p> <p>Mills, however, appears to take a softer line than her organisation's chairman. Online News is, she admits, \"one of the world leaders, and it should be there.\" </p> <p>\"That is exactly the kind of thing they should be doing, even although there are head to head commercial operations, including ITN which is a member of Bipa.\" </p> <p>The problem arises where, she says, the BBC launches into areas where there is already fierce competition - like sport and, last year, into internet service provision with <a href=\"HTTP://WWW.Freebeeb.net\" target=\"_new\">Freebeeb.net</a> last year. </p> <p>That move sparked a flurry of protest both from rival ISPs and content providers, who feared the BBC's broadcasting channels could persuade large numbers of people to sign up for freebeeb.net then remain within the BBC's internet offering when they got online. </p> <p>Their fears were certainly not allayed by freebeeb.net's launch, given a little glitz by two of the stars of BBC Television's Top Gear programme. This, they said, was a perfect example of the BBC's brands and stars, built up by publicly funded channels, being used for commercial gain. </p> <p>In the end freebeeb.net - run by BBC Worldwide, the commercial part of the BBC not funded by the licence fee - has not proved the massive force in the UK ISP market that many feared, and cross-promotion has been limited. </p> <p>But, says Bipa, it is a good example of how the BBC's commercial and publicly funded online activities have to be monitored and carefully kept apart. Mills is reluctant to say what the BBC's role should be in the online world. \"I don't think it's up to me to decide what the BBC's role should be, but there should be a debate,\" she says. </p> <p>\"They should not be a national champion in the way that they seem to have been putting themselves forward, and in some ways as the government has supported them. There is no other European country which has a champion in this way. </p> <p>\"You hear them [the BBC] saying 'We're increasing internet usage' and I think that's rubbish - I think what will get people online is lower telco costs, cheaper PCs, better security and consumer confidence. The fact that the BBC is online is not going to get hordes of people using the internet. That is really misguided. </p> <p>\"The public service remit would have to be something of quality and worthy of the public funding, not interfering with the private sector too much.\" </p> <p>The BBC's response has been to point to the quality of its offering and the corporation's \"core values\" of information, education and entertainment. </p> <p>Nigel Chapman is the BBC's director of online, the non-commercial arm which includes news and that controversial sport site, but not BBC Worldwide's <a href=\"http://www.beeb.com\" target=\"_new\"> beeb.com</a> and freebeeb.net. He says the BBC will not be put off from its aim to expand rapidly in the online world, with its continuing ambitions in this arena to be confirmed by the appointment of a new all-powerful director of new media within a few weeks. </p> <p>\"Online as a medium is here to stay, and is expanding very fast,\" he says. \"We know that in some groups - in particular young people - their consumption of traditional media falls as online usage expands. So you need to be in online to continue using all the weapons in your armoury and build relations with licence-fee payers in the United Kingdom.\" </p> <p>The theme of keeping up with licence-fee payers' migration to the webrecurs in Chapman's defence of the corporation's publicly funded activities online, and is one of the main reasons he insists: \"there is a special role for the BBC on the web\". </p> <p>\"Our new sports online site is a classic example of something that is strategically valuable to the BBC,\" he says. \"We need to reinforce the value of BBC sports to users, and it's extremely valuable because we have an awful lot of high-quality sports content - both audio, video and text and pictures - and a high standard of journalism. It's a situation where both the BBC and the licence-fee payers win. It's a perfect example of an area we should be in.\" </p> <p>But, as Sportal and the BBC's other sporting rivals ask, does the world need another sports site? Not surprisingly, he says yes, it does. \"I understand their fears, and I'm not surprised they see the BBC as a major competitor - it is a major competitor. But just because Sportal.com and everybody else is going into sport online doesn't mean the BBC should not be in it.\" </p> <p>Chapman says that much of the new site's content already exists, and it is the corporation's duty to make it available to licence-fee payers. </p> <p>\"I think it is really important that the BBC makes the most of its investment in sport. We have this material in the BBC already - it would be a pretty sad situation if we weren't allowed to use the internet as another platform for people to access it.\" </p> <p>Chapman also defends the news content deal between the BBC and Yahoo!, which prompted one commercial content distributor to say this week he had his head in his hands, asking \"why?\" The arrangement, he said, meant the biggest content site was in bed with the biggest portal: a formidable partnership that he felt any for-profit distributor would struggle to break through. </p> <p>Chapman says that is not so. \"The deal with <a href=\"http://www.yahoo.com\" target=\"_new\">Yahoo!</a> is not an exclusive one. We are in discussions with other portals about something similar both for News Online and for other parts of BBC Online. It is not our ambition to give Yahoo! some marketplace advantage over other portals. Our ambition is to use our relationship with portals so that people who do not come direct to bbc.co.uk can see our material well presented in portals.\" </p> <p>He also gives short shrift to some more outspoken members of the UK's internet community who suggest that the BBC is, in fact, not as good at internet content as it - and others - think. \"All the indicators - both qualitative and quantitative - all the awards, all the traffic, the independent assessors - all of them say what a brilliant job the BBC has done in Online, and how pivotal it has been in creating a benchmark of quality,\" he says. </p> <p>\"We're not complacent - there's a lot more to do, and many areas we should be in that we are not. The issue of web television is to come. </p> <p>\"But in the narrow-band world in which most people live we have put a stake in the ground about quality, range and depth of content which, frankly, is not matched by anyone else in the UK market.\"</p>",

That move sparked a flurry of protest both from rival ISPs and content providers, who feared the BBC's broadcasting channels could persuade large numbers of people to sign up for freebeeb.net then remain within the BBC's internet offering when they got online. Their fears were certainly not allayed by freebeeb.net's launch, given a little glitz by two of the stars of BBC Television's Top Gear programme. This, they said, was a perfect example of the BBC's brands and stars, built up by publicly funded channels, being used for commercial gain. In the end freebeeb.net - run by BBC Worldwide, the commercial part of the BBC not funded by the licence fee - has not proved the massive force in the UK ISP market that many feared, and cross-promotion has been limited. But, says Bipa, it is a good example of how the BBC's commercial and publicly funded online activities have to be monitored and carefully kept apart. Mills is reluctant to say what the BBC's role should be in the online world. \"I don't think it's up to me to decide what the BBC's role should be, but there should be a debate,\" she says. \"They should not be a national champion in the way that they seem to have been putting themselves forward, and in some ways as the government has supported them. There is no other European country which has a champion in this way. \"You hear them [the BBC] saying 'We're increasing internet usage' and I think that's rubbish - I think what will get people online is lower telco costs, cheaper PCs, better security and consumer confidence. The fact that the BBC is online is not going to get hordes of people using the internet. That is really misguided. \"The public service remit would have to be something of quality and worthy of the public funding, not interfering with the private sector too much.\" The BBC's response has been to point to the quality of its offering and the corporation's \"core values\" of information, education and entertainment. Nigel Chapman is the BBC's director of online, the non-commercial arm which includes news and that controversial sport site, but not BBC Worldwide's beeb.com and freebeeb.net. He says the BBC will not be put off from its aim to expand rapidly in the online world, with its continuing ambitions in this arena to be confirmed by the appointment of a new all-powerful director of new media within a few weeks. \"Online as a medium is here to stay, and is expanding very fast,\" he says. \"We know that in some groups - in particular young people - their consumption of traditional media falls as online usage expands. So you need to be in online to continue using all the weapons in your armoury and build relations with licence-fee payers in the United Kingdom.\" The theme of keeping up with licence-fee payers' migration to the webrecurs in Chapman's defence of the corporation's publicly funded activities online, and is one of the main reasons he insists: \"there is a special role for the BBC on the web\". \"Our new sports online site is a classic example of something that is strategically valuable to the BBC,\" he says. \"We need to reinforce the value of BBC sports to users, and it's extremely valuable because we have an awful lot of high-quality sports content - both audio, video and text and pictures - and a high standard of journalism. It's a situation where both the BBC and the licence-fee payers win. It's a perfect example of an area we should be in.\" But, as Sportal and the BBC's other sporting rivals ask, does the world need another sports site? Not surprisingly, he says yes, it does. \"I understand their fears, and I'm not surprised they see the BBC as a major competitor - it is a major competitor. But just because Sportal.com and everybody else is going into sport online doesn't mean the BBC should not be in it.\" Chapman says that much of the new site's content already exists, and it is the corporation's duty to make it available to licence-fee payers. \"I think it is really important that the BBC makes the most of its investment in sport. We have this material in the BBC already - it would be a pretty sad situation if we weren't allowed to use the internet as another platform for people to access it.\" Chapman also defends the news content deal between the BBC and Yahoo!, which prompted one commercial content distributor to say this week he had his head in his hands, asking \"why?\" The arrangement, he said, meant the biggest content site was in bed with the biggest portal: a formidable partnership that he felt any for-profit distributor would struggle to break through. Chapman says that is not so. \"The deal with Yahoo! is not an exclusive one. We are in discussions with other portals about something similar both for News Online and for other parts of BBC Online. It is not our ambition to give Yahoo! some marketplace advantage over other portals. Our ambition is to use our relationship with portals so that people who do not come direct to bbc.co.uk can see our material well presented in portals.\" He also gives short shrift to some more outspoken members of the UK's internet community who suggest that the BBC is, in fact, not as good at internet content as it - and others - think. \"All the indicators - both qualitative and quantitative - all the awards, all the traffic, the independent assessors - all of them say what a brilliant job the BBC has done in Online, and how pivotal it has been in creating a benchmark of quality,\" he says. \"We're not complacent - there's a lot more to do, and many areas we should be in that we are not. The issue of web television is to come. \"But in the narrow-band world in which most people live we have put a stake in the ground about quality, range and depth of content which, frankly, is not matched by anyone else in the UK market.\"",
