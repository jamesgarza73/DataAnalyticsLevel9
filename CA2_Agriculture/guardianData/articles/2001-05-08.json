Here Khan works within the modular phrases of his native Kathak style and blows them open with the blunter, wilder moves of modern dance. In concentrated riffs he moves from radiant stillness to ferocious bursts of speed, changing drastic gear from tiny classical detail to raging, ragged leaps. The beauty of his dancing, the absoluteness of his control hold the theatre breathless. </p> <p>Adam Cooper is Khan's equal at dominating the stage, simply by virtue of his personal glamour. But in Jan De Schynkel's Can't Bark he reminds us of the dangerous intensity of his imagination. In this funny, disturbing study of conflicting desire Cooper is half man, half dog, an angry, rude, comic, disgusting beast. He clutches on to his own lead, rubs at his outrageously phallic tail, dances himself frantic and glowers passionately at the audience. It is a wonderfully bizarre piece. </p> <p>Wayne McGregor's Codex is performed by the excellent Ben Ash, whose square, terrier body gives an intriguing physical slant to the long, flickering lines of McGregor's choreography, hardening its limbs, and building solid texture through its sudden kinks and changes of pace. Ash, like the other two, is a virtuoso in his own style - which leaves the last of the four, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Seguette, looking a little like a wallflower. </p> <p>The wit of J\u00e9rme Bel's Shirtologie emerges too slowly and too intermittently as Seguette simply stands centre stage and peels off a series of T-shirts, each one emblazoned with the logos of 21st-century capitalism. Seguette does, however, have an enchanting way of looking crushed and bemused by the weight of information he's carrying on his chest, and his mournful humour adds to a showcase for male performance and choreography that deserves much wider showing.</p>",

The beauty of his dancing, the absoluteness of his control hold the theatre breathless. Adam Cooper is Khan's equal at dominating the stage, simply by virtue of his personal glamour. But in Jan De Schynkel's Can't Bark he reminds us of the dangerous intensity of his imagination. In this funny, disturbing study of conflicting desire Cooper is half man, half dog, an angry, rude, comic, disgusting beast. He clutches on to his own lead, rubs at his outrageously phallic tail, dances himself frantic and glowers passionately at the audience. It is a wonderfully bizarre piece. Wayne McGregor's Codex is performed by the excellent Ben Ash, whose square, terrier body gives an intriguing physical slant to the long, flickering lines of McGregor's choreography, hardening its limbs, and building solid texture through its sudden kinks and changes of pace. Ash, like the other two, is a virtuoso in his own style - which leaves the last of the four, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Seguette, looking a little like a wallflower. The wit of J\u00e9rme Bel's Shirtologie emerges too slowly and too intermittently as Seguette simply stands centre stage and peels off a series of T-shirts, each one emblazoned with the logos of 21st-century capitalism. Seguette does, however, have an enchanting way of looking crushed and bemused by the weight of information he's carrying on his chest, and his mournful humour adds to a showcase for male performance and choreography that deserves much wider showing.",

      "body": "<p>The second orchestral concert in this year's Royal Northern College of Music cello festival included one acknowledged masterpiece - Dvorak's concerto - and devoted the remaining time to rarely heard works. Samuel Barber's 1945 concerto, played by the young cellist Liwei Qin, is a work of modest dimensions. Apart from a formidable first movement cadenza, it shuns virtuosity and passionate intensity. Qin was sensitive to its gentle eloquence and to the finely balanced interplay between soloist and orchestra. If the result was slightly bland, it was only because the concerto itself never quite manages to inspire. </p> <p>Ernest Bloch's \"Hebraic rhapsody\" Schelomo has not dated well. But cellists like to play it, and when the cellist is Ralph Kirshbaum it seems ungrateful to focus on the work's weaknesses.

      "bodyText": "The second orchestral concert in this year's Royal Northern College of Music cello festival included one acknowledged masterpiece - Dvorak's concerto - and devoted the remaining time to rarely heard works. Samuel Barber's 1945 concerto, played by the young cellist Liwei Qin, is a work of modest dimensions. Apart from a formidable first movement cadenza, it shuns virtuosity and passionate intensity. Qin was sensitive to its gentle eloquence and to the finely balanced interplay between soloist and orchestra. If the result was slightly bland, it was only because the concerto itself never quite manages to inspire. Ernest Bloch's \"Hebraic rhapsody\" Schelomo has not dated well. But cellists like to play it, and when the cellist is Ralph Kirshbaum it seems ungrateful to focus on the work's weaknesses. The music was outclassed by Kirshbaum's playing: his wonderful sensitivity to colour made Schelomo worth hearing, for once. The American composer Aaron Jay Kernis originally wrote Air for Joshua Bell; his transcription for cello received its European premiere in Saturday's concert. As a work for cello, Air is vaguely in the mode of John Tavener's Protecting Veil: long-breathed and harmonically very simple, with string and harp textures straight out of Mahler's Fifth Symphony. As the soundtrack to a romantic film, it would be just great. But, in spite of all the loving care lavished on it by Truls Mork, as a concert piece it is tedious.

In Show a Leg, she utilises archetypes - woman as naked figure in art; the glamorous pin-up look; the mad woman in a medical context - but departs radically from them by never revealing these women's stories, their secrets, their motivations. Just as you think you're tracing a narrative, the image dissolves and moves on. Rist disperses her images through the space - they pop up before you and eerily follow you through the gauzy maze of nets.

She even took on George Bush for the US presidency (if her name had been on the Florida nomination papers, she'd probably have won). </p> <p>But now the chips are down and so Barbie is retreating to her least controversial and biggest selling role, as a fairy-tale heroine. She'll make her professional ballet debut as Clara in the Nutcracker and accompanying the new-look doll comes a feature film, so Mattel can really hammer home the romance and crank up the merchandising. </p> <p>It is music to the ears of die-hard Barbie fans such as toyshop owner Val Stedham, who believes wholeheartedly in the world's single bestselling toy. \"Barbie is a dream to sell,\" says Stedham, who runs Moon's Toymaster in Newmarket. \"She's a complete classic - everyone's going to want the Nutcracker doll for Christmas.\" </p> <p>Everyone might be a bit of an exaggeration, but it's safe to say that the queue will include 10-year-old Stephanie Oliver of Chingford in east London, whose 104-strong Barbie collection is one of the largest in Britain. Stephanie got her first Barbie when she was three - she can't remember her name, but she came with a big tube and you could blow bubbles around her. </p> <p>At the moment, with her Sats coming up in a couple of weeks, schoolwork is keeping her from her beloved dolls more than she would like - but she still manages to find time to fix their hairstyles and, occasionally, to play her favourite game. \"I set up a big shop with loads of Barbie shoes and outfits, then I get all my Barbies to choose new outfits for themselves,\" she says. \"As well as my Barbies, I get the others to come along, all her sisters, like Kelly and Skipper and Stacie. I've even got a Krissy - she's Barbie's baby sister.\" </p> <p>Fifteen years ago, Stephanie would have been a typical Barbie fan, but in the current market she's a bit of an anachronism. Today's girls are older, younger, and the effect of that has been to put Barbie on the two- and three-year-olds' wish lists. Stephanie says that, though many of her friends have the odd Barbie or two at the back of a drawer, few play with them or acquire new ones. </p> <p>This, in fact, is the nub of Mattel's problem and the reason why, although it's the Barbies in frilly pink numbers with big hair who sell best, the design team works flat out to capture the imaginations of girls of eight, nine and 10, who just might go for an astronaut Barbie but wouldn't be seen dead with a Snow White. </p> <p>Today's Barbie \"dream market\" is the likes of Daisy Chitnis, almost five and the proud owner of a sizeable Barbie collection. Jane, Daisy's mum, takes the usual post-feminist line on her daughter's obsession of the moment: Barbie might be ridiculous in terms of body shape, but it doesn't matter because it isn't what Daisy and her friends are aware of as they decide whether to slide her into the pink chiffon, the print sundress or the full-skirted ballgown. </p> <p>In fact, Jane says, Barbie's looks belie a life of unparalleled tedium. \"In Daisy's games, they're always going to the supermarket, doing the cleaning or looking after the younger children,\" she says. \"They may be a little overdressed for the dull life they lead, but it doesn't seem to bother them - and it certainly doesn't bother Daisy.\" </p> <p>Far from moulding the lifestyle to fit the doll, today's young Barbie-owners mould the doll to fit the lifestyle they see around them. So while she might be dressed to the nines and tottering around on absurd heels, chances are, in the world of make-believe, Barbie will be hanging out at the supermarket and the school gates just like the real women Daisy and her friends see around them. </p> <p>Most Barbie fans trace their interest back to the excitement of being given their first doll for a birthday or Christmas present, but at 58, toyshop owner Val Stedham is older than her favourite toy. She was hooked on the Barbie dream when she saw how enthusiastically her daughter Claire, now 28, played with the doll - in fact, she says, it was seeing Claire playing with her Barbies that convinced her to take up running a toyshop and she now feels \"passionate\" about giving parents advice on good toys that are well-made and spur imaginative play. </p> <p>Not everyone shares her enthusiasm, however. Dr Elizabeth Mapstone, a chartered psychologist who writes on sexual stereotyping, says she wouldn't have dreamed of giving the glitzy doll to her daughters, now in their 30s. \"But when they were old enough to have pocket money, they did go out and buy them themselves and in my opinion it didn't do either of them any good. The trouble is, Barbie's figure is nothing like normal - it's distorted to the extent that any woman who looked like her would have something seriously wrong with her and whatever people might like to think, that image does affect a young person. </p> <p>\"Barbie isn't the worst thing in the world, but it's not a good thing for any girl, at any stage of her development, to get the notion that the ideal female figure is this ultra-slim, etiolated form. I think buying her is a mistake. If you don't want your child to be affected by this image of the female body, then don't let her have a Barbie, it's as simple as that.\" </p> <p>Cassidy Park, vice president of Barbie design and development in the US, counters that, far from being a brainless glamour-girl, Barbie is a young woman of her times, a role model making today's girls aware of the vast number of careers available. \"There aren't any limits to what Barbie can become,\" Park says, though she does admit, in the next breath, that it's the romantic, big-dress Barbies that sell in droves and the astronauts, dentists and vets who get dusty on the toyshop shelves. </p> <p>Just five years younger than her star product, Park shares Barbie's love of all things pretty and pink. She trained as a fashion designer and chanced upon a job at Mattel when she started freelancing after having her daughter, Turner, eight years ago. \"I just came in temporarily to work on Barbie and straight away I absolutely loved it,\" she says. \"It seemed an amazingly natural thing for me to do. As a child I'd always played with Barbie, though I wouldn't say I was a diehard fan. I am now, of course - I live and breathe her, and I spend my life deciding where she's going to go next and what she's going to do.\" </p> <p>Back in Newmarket, there is no doubting who's come to town when the pink Barbie-mobile rides down the main street for the great lady's occasional promotional visits to Val Stedham's toyshop. \"I only have to put up one notice saying she's coming and we get a queue out the door all day long,\" Stedham says. \"She signs their autographs, chats with them, talks about her life.

      "body": "<p>I have been a bit stuck this week - stuck in Santiago. It is my own fault as I decided to book a tour for Peru and Machu Picchu. That meant sending out lots of emails, waiting for replies, making decisions and more waiting. I should have done it all weeks ago. </p> <p>Santiago is not a bad place to be stuck. It is a pleasant city, roomier and less cosmopolitan than Buenos Aries, more Spanish. There is the same shiny shoe obsession and lots of coffee shops, although in some of them there are no tables and chairs, you just stand round a high counter. The Chileans obviously love their ice cream, as these places abound, vying to produce the biggest most elaborate ones. </p> <p>I had another attack of deja vu as I arrived on Sunday and everything was shut. My accommodation was in a lovely hostel with charming hosts, but it was too much to pay for a room with no windows and a dribble of a shower. So again I moved on next day to a place half the price, new and clean if somewhat soulless. </p> <p>Monday I must have walked miles exploring the city. I walked up Cerro Santa Lucia, a huge rock in the middle of the city which gives lovely views over Santiago with the Andes in the background. </p> <p>Tuesday was going to be bank and shopping day in a different area of the city. (Sadly I have managed to lose my sleeping bag somewhere in Argentina. I must have left it in one of the hotels before I went to Iguazu.) I ventured onto the underground pleasantly surprised at how quiet it was. The totally shuttered shopping centre made me check my little calendar to then realise it was May 1 - a holiday here too. </p> <p>Instead, I went to the even bigger hill of San Cristobel which forms the Parque Metropolitano. A funicular takes you up almost vertically and you come down by cable car. At the very top is a huge statue of the virgin Mary, nearly as big as all the satellite masts that surround it. </p> <p>Wednesday was doing all the things I meant to do Tuesday. I even managed to get a bit of a trim of my straggles in a hairdressers. Risky with no Spanish but it turned out OK. Thanks to Simon for the info on Buenos Aires and Paul on Santiago- I never managed to find the fish market or the restaurant he recommended. </p> <p>Replies to my emails were now starting to come in and I had an offer from Exodus to go on a trip walking the Inca Trail.

      "bodyText": "I have been a bit stuck this week - stuck in Santiago. It is my own fault as I decided to book a tour for Peru and Machu Picchu. That meant sending out lots of emails, waiting for replies, making decisions and more waiting. I should have done it all weeks ago. Santiago is not a bad place to be stuck. It is a pleasant city, roomier and less cosmopolitan than Buenos Aries, more Spanish. There is the same shiny shoe obsession and lots of coffee shops, although in some of them there are no tables and chairs, you just stand round a high counter. The Chileans obviously love their ice cream, as these places abound, vying to produce the biggest most elaborate ones. I had another attack of deja vu as I arrived on Sunday and everything was shut. My accommodation was in a lovely hostel with charming hosts, but it was too much to pay for a room with no windows and a dribble of a shower. So again I moved on next day to a place half the price, new and clean if somewhat soulless. Monday I must have walked miles exploring the city. I walked up Cerro Santa Lucia, a huge rock in the middle of the city which gives lovely views over Santiago with the Andes in the background. Tuesday was going to be bank and shopping day in a different area of the city. (Sadly I have managed to lose my sleeping bag somewhere in Argentina. I must have left it in one of the hotels before I went to Iguazu.) I ventured onto the underground pleasantly surprised at how quiet it was. The totally shuttered shopping centre made me check my little calendar to then realise it was May 1 - a holiday here too. Instead, I went to the even bigger hill of San Cristobel which forms the Parque Metropolitano. A funicular takes you up almost vertically and you come down by cable car. At the very top is a huge statue of the virgin Mary, nearly as big as all the satellite masts that surround it. Wednesday was doing all the things I meant to do Tuesday. I even managed to get a bit of a trim of my straggles in a hairdressers. Risky with no Spanish but it turned out OK. Thanks to Simon for the info on Buenos Aires and Paul on Santiago- I never managed to find the fish market or the restaurant he recommended. Replies to my emails were now starting to come in and I had an offer from Exodus to go on a trip walking the Inca Trail. I agonised whether to do it. The aches in my legs after 3 days of walking round a flat city convinced me that maybe at this point I am just too tired. I think I would have gone for it a couple of months ago. I hope I do not regret the decision when I am back home and rested. With only 4 weeks to go my thoughts inevitably begin to turn to home more often.

      "bodyText": "Two of the UK's leading scientific figures have publicly criticised government funding of science. Professor David King, the government's chief scientific advisor, told the House of Commons' science and technology select committee last week that he was not confident about civil servants' capabilities as too much governmental funding was now being outsourced. He said that the loss of research expertise within government meant ministers no longer knew what questions they could ask of scientists. Other senior academics agree that something is wrong, and not just with the funding of research within government. The chief executive and deputy chairman of the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), Professor John Lawton, says that while research councils' budgets have increased significantly in real terms over the last ten years, the opposite has been the case in government research. And even though he has been a beneficiary of the changes, the loss of government research facilities has affected everyone.

      "body": "<p>Cornwall is to get its first university as part of a \u00a354m drive to keep local talent in the county, it was announced this week. </p> <p>At present, approximately 90% of young people in Cornwall who take up places in higher education leave the county and do not return. </p> <p>But it is hoped that the brand new, purpose-built university will encourage youngsters to stay in the county. As well as offering the chance to study for degrees and other professional qualifications, it will also provide internet-style \"lifelong learning\" for older students who want to improve their skills. The so-called Combined Universities of Cornwall in Falmouth will join forces with the region's further education colleges, and will be the hub of post-16 learning in the area. A site in Falmouth will be the base for degree level study and research. It will aim to provide the region with a highly skilled young workforce to aid business growth, Education Secretary David Blunkett said earlier this week. </p> <p>The project is being jointly financed by the government (which has earmarked \u00a329.7m for the first phase of the project) and the European Union, using funding designed to assist areas in need of regeneration. Mr Blunkett said the new campus would mean a growth in industry and an improvement of aspiration for people in the area. A low proportion of the workforce in Cornwall has vocational, professional or academic qualifications. As many as 2,500 students every year leave Cornwall to go to university elsewhere. </p> <p>\"Setting up new higher education provision in Cornwall will benefit local people and local businesses,\" he said. \"Students will not have to leave the county to study at university and the local economy will benefit from a ready source of highly trained people. This innovative project will encourage closer links with industry and business within the county, and the growth of industries that rely on highly trained staff. </p> <p>\"The new higher education places, which will be made available across the county, will serve local people of all ages and help to raise aspirations within the region. I see this as a great opportunity for people in Cornwall to take up the challenge of lifelong learning and improve their skills and job prospects.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Cornwall is to get its first university as part of a \u00a354m drive to keep local talent in the county, it was announced this week. At present, approximately 90% of young people in Cornwall who take up places in higher education leave the county and do not return. But it is hoped that the brand new, purpose-built university will encourage youngsters to stay in the county. As well as offering the chance to study for degrees and other professional qualifications, it will also provide internet-style \"lifelong learning\" for older students who want to improve their skills. The so-called Combined Universities of Cornwall in Falmouth will join forces with the region's further education colleges, and will be the hub of post-16 learning in the area. A site in Falmouth will be the base for degree level study and research. It will aim to provide the region with a highly skilled young workforce to aid business growth, Education Secretary David Blunkett said earlier this week. The project is being jointly financed by the government (which has earmarked \u00a329.7m for the first phase of the project) and the European Union, using funding designed to assist areas in need of regeneration. Mr Blunkett said the new campus would mean a growth in industry and an improvement of aspiration for people in the area. A low proportion of the workforce in Cornwall has vocational, professional or academic qualifications. As many as 2,500 students every year leave Cornwall to go to university elsewhere. \"Setting up new higher education provision in Cornwall will benefit local people and local businesses,\" he said. \"Students will not have to leave the county to study at university and the local economy will benefit from a ready source of highly trained people. This innovative project will encourage closer links with industry and business within the county, and the growth of industries that rely on highly trained staff. \"The new higher education places, which will be made available across the county, will serve local people of all ages and help to raise aspirations within the region. I see this as a great opportunity for people in Cornwall to take up the challenge of lifelong learning and improve their skills and job prospects.\"",

This compares unfavourably with 1987 figures estimating that fewer than one in four students showed \"significant emotional disturbance\". </p> <p>A survey of students at two London universities published last December showed that students had poorer physical and substantially poorer psychological health than non-students of the same age and sex. The latest Annual Survey of Counselling in Further and Higher Education confirmed that the proportion of \"seri ously disturbed\" students continues to increase. Meanwhile, student suicides have risen dramatically - from 2.4 per 100,000 students in 1983/4 to 9.7 in 1993/4 - a four-fold increase. </p> <p>University counselling services certainly report increases in students seeking help, though Christopher Butler, head of the counselling service at Royal Holloway, London, cautions against jumping to conclusions. \"My service is certainly busier, but we can't say with any certainty why this is so. For example, we may be publicising the service more effectively, or students may perceive it as being less stigmatising.\" </p> <p>Two things are clear: student numbers have increased in recent years, and students are under more financial pressure. As well as being a source of stress, financial problems have clear links with depression and anxiety. Last year's survey of the two London universities found that poor mental health was linked to longer working hours outside university, and that students who were considering abandoning their studies because of finances were likely to have poorer mental health. </p> <p>A current research project looking at suicide prevention from the student's perspective asks students to fill in an online questionnaire. \"Finances and accommodation problems are emerging as key sources of stress for students,\" says Natasha Donnelly, a lecturer at University College Chichester, who is doing the research. </p> <p>Some counselling services, such as Royal Holloway's, take a proactive approach at this time of year. \"Exams can act as a 'precipitating event' to further problems,\" says Christopher Butler. \"We offer a psychological profiling questionnaire for students to help them assess whether they are likely to have problems around exam time and provide support accordingly.\" </p> <p>Additional pressures do not help. \"Increasingly, students are forced to take on part-time jobs, and these exacerbate the stress of study,\" says Rachel Cashman, the National Union of Students vice-president for welfare. \"In the run-up to exams, students who juggle revision with part-time work and other course demands are left with little time for relaxation, which makes them particularly vulnerable to stress.\" </p> <p>The view of the NUS is that the introduction of tuition fees and scrapping of the maintenance grant, combined with a policy of wider access to higher education, have put pressure on student support services.

I was on betablockers and antidepressants, and having cognitive behavioural therapy sessions at the hospital. I somehow kept up with the coursework, more or less.

Singapore's flagship institution of higher learning enrols some 30,000 students and employs around 1,600 faculty members. The downward salary revisions were among the first fruits of a number of significant changes inaugurated last year by the Southeast Asian nation's government, which is looking for its centres of learning to find new and better ways of aggressively courting American and European scholars to collaborate in their global endeavours. Singapore's two established universities have long been part of the former colony's strong British-style civil-service tradition, dating back to its independence in 1965, in which salary levels and pay increases have pretty much always been a sure fact of academic life. A third institution, the Singapore Management University, which opened for business nearly a year ago, already operates along private lines. At the same time, new institutional initiatives at the universities have until now tended to be closely monitored by the state, as much as the wider systems of university governance. \"In the new global economy, however, we need to move beyond that,\" said C F Shih, the vice chancellor of the National University of Singapore, at the time of the announced changes. \"Higher education is no longer about simply being the best in Singapore or even the region - our universities have to operate as world-class institutions.\" Effectively, he said, the universities are now operating in a manner similar to British universities, which, although publicly funded, enjoy autonomy in matters of governance and are free from overt political meddling. Singapore's Ministry of Education will no longer scrutinise individual decisions and proposals made by its universities, and financial support from the public treasury will now be made in three-year cycles instead of annually.

      "bodyText": "They are a familiar sight and sound at all school sporting events: parents urging their progeny to glory on the field. But in the US, some of them are not setting the younger generation an example in sportsmanship. So competitive are these parents that physical or verbal abuse takes place on the sidelines at about 15% of events - triple the incidence five years ago, according to the National Alliance for Youth Sports. More than 20 states have adopted, or are considering, tougher penalties against those who attack officials and in some places parents are obliged to have counselling before their children are allowed to play competitive sports. Other matches must be played in silence to combat \"sideline rage\". One father from Reading, Massachusetts, goes on trial shortly, accused of killing another father in a dispute while they were watching their sons at hockey practice. He denies manslaughter. Ten people were arrested when a fight broke out between more than 30 parents at a football game in El Paso, Texas. One father stabbed another between the eyes. A volleyball coach in Rockford, Illinois, was sacked after being accused of taking a meat cleaver to school after an argument with a referee. \"Many parents have lost sight of the purpose of sports,\" said Thomas Tutko, a clinical sports psychologist. \"They're asking 'Is my kid going to get a scholarship? Is my kid going to win?'\" Parents in Jupiter, Florida, must attend an hour-long good-behaviour session before little Buddy is allowed to take the field and in El Paso, where the message clearly takes longer to sink in, the session takes three-and-a-half hours. Another 300 cities have plans to follow suit.",

The scientists say that, in the next 5m years, short-term evolution will favour those species able to thrive in the margins of human settlement. They also warned that decisions made in the next few decades will determine the fate of 500,000bn people, adding that efforts to protect species and wild habitats now will dictate the future course of evolution. In their startling wake-up call, the group of US, African and British researchers writing in the US journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, compared the present mass extinction of species on Earth to past mass extinctions; then, it took roughly 5m years for biological diversity to reassert itself. \"Suppose that the average number of people on Earth during the future recovery period is 2.5bn, by contrast with the 6bn today,\" said two of the scientists, Norman Myers of Oxford University and Andrew Knoll of Harvard. \"Under these conditions, the total number of people affected by what we do - or do not do - during the next few decades will be in the order of 500 trillion, 10,000 times more people than have existed until now. \"We are thus engaged in by far the largest 'decision' every taken by one human community on the unconsulted behalf of future societies.\" The scientists suggested that the world is entering a new period of geological time, the Homogecene, marked by all parts of the planet increasingly coming to resemble each other. David Woodruff, of the University of California at San Diego, said that between 3,000 and 30,000 of Earth's estimated 10m species were disappearing each year. \"We live at a geological instant when global rates of extinction are at an all time high for the last 65m years, and are increasing,\" he said. \"The biosphere will have fewer species and be subject to more weed, pest and disease outbreaks...the new [habitats] will be more easily disturbed and invaded, and will have an aesthetically unappealing dullness.\" None of this means that evolution will stop - just that it might go in an undesirable direction. \"Evolution is not over - set back perhaps - but by no means over,\" Dr Woodruff said. Scientists who studied evolution, he said, were obliged to abandon their preference for looking backwards and begin considering the future. \"Some of us advocate a shift from saving things, the products of evolution, to saving the underlying process, evolution itself,\" he said. \"Like it or not, evolutionary biologists have to recognise that the ultimate test of their science is not their ability to solve the riddles of the past and the origin of species, but rather to manage their viability and prevent their premature extinction - to manage the biosphere's future.\" Dr Myers said that much more emphasis should be put on protecting plants and insects, to protect the evolutionary pool, rather than on preserving big beasts like tigers or elephants, which are too few to evolve.

Euan Blair, three years younger than Jenna, was drunk and incapable in the street. The predominant reaction in the UK to Euan's case was \"What is all the fuss about?

A culture of intoxication has become entrenched in the youth scene, the main theatre of the \"recreational drug wars\" in which alcohol is now consumed as one psychoactive commodity among others. Induction into this culture begins early - 11- to 15-year-olds are reckoned to be \"starter drinkers\", helped on their way by the wide range of alcopops apparently designed especially for them. By the time they get to Euan's age, many teenagers are already looking down on alcopops as drinks for kids.

Alcohol-related violence is endemic.

      "body": "<p>What two words are guaranteed to make anyone working in further education want to slit their wrists? Funding deficit? College inspection? Not even close. They are \"PowerPoint presentation\". No meeting or lecture can take place these days without some earnest suit whipping out his or her laptop and flashing up a few blindingly obvious bullet points on to a white screen, while simultaneously regurgitating unintelligible jargonese for 30 minutes at a stretch without once stopping to draw breath. Moreover the speaker is almost always totally unaware that three-quarters of the audience have lapsed into coma. </p> <p>Engaging the listeners is an arcane artform to many administrators and lecturers, but new research from Dr Tim Clark and Dr David Greatbatch of King's College London offers hope for both speakers and their audiences. The two academics found that unlike politicians, who use rhetorical devices such as contrast and three-part lists - Education, Education, Education - to generate applause, top management gurus, such as Tom Peters, Rosabeth Moss Kanter and Gary Hamil, use humour to get their audience onside. </p> <p>\"The point about laughter,\" says Dr Clark, reader in management at KCL, \"is that it is an ambiguous response. People can either be laughing with you or at you, but no one in the audience can be sure exactly what someone else is feeling as the physical expression is the same, and the overall result is a positive feeling among the listeners. </p> <p>\"In presenting their ideas, charismatic management speakers often have to disparage practices that a great many of their listeners may be using and praise other working practices that their audience are unlikely to be using. The speakers are walking a tightrope: they want to get their message across, while both leaving the audience feeling good about themselves and keeping their reputations in tact. Laughter is an excellent way of achieving this.\" </p> <p>Dr Clark maintains that laughter is not an automatic response. Rather it is a response to predetermined stimuli. It is hard to be sure whether management gurus have an intuitive feel for what works and use laughter stimuli without being conscious they are doing so, or whether their talks are scripted down to the last pause. Dr Clark inclines to a mixture of the two, but whatever the case, he and Greatbatch have identified some commonly used signals that generate the laughter response. </p> <p>\"The methods include both verbal and non-verbal signals,\" he continues. \"There's a laughter smile, where the speaker bares his teeth, rolling the eyes, and even chuckling out loud. They also change the intonation of the voice, mimic people, or tell jokes and stories.\" </p> <p>The bottom line of getting a laugh is that it creates an illusion of a common viewpoint regardless of whether any consensus has actually been reached. As such it seems the ideal tactic for all those engaged in further education. Chris Moiser, a lecturer in biology and zoology at Plymouth College, is more than well aware that many lecturers fail to come up to the mark when it comes to engaging their students' attention. </p> <p>\"Some of the students are really enthusiastic and on the ball, others are struggling to keep up and some are only there because their parents will kill them if they don't turn up,\" he says. \"Somehow you've got to find a way of getting across specific information to all three groups at the same time, and it's very hard to do.\" </p> <p>So what tactics has Moiser employed to grab back an audience whose attention has begun to wander? \"I once pulled a ferret out of my trousers during a lecture on mammals,\" he continues, \"but one of the best diversions I saw was a speaker at a zoological meeting who suddenly bunged a slide into his presentation that read, 'All illegally parked cars will be clamped'. That woke everyone up.\" </p> <p>Pride of place, though, goes to one of Moiser's colleagues. \"Some years ago he used to include a picture of a scantily clad woman into his lecture slides,\" smiles Moiser, \"but he stopped when that sort of thing became un-PC. Still, there's a new round of redundancies in the offing and he's very keen to go, so he's told me that he might start including it again.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "What two words are guaranteed to make anyone working in further education want to slit their wrists? Funding deficit? College inspection? Not even close. They are \"PowerPoint presentation\". No meeting or lecture can take place these days without some earnest suit whipping out his or her laptop and flashing up a few blindingly obvious bullet points on to a white screen, while simultaneously regurgitating unintelligible jargonese for 30 minutes at a stretch without once stopping to draw breath. Moreover the speaker is almost always totally unaware that three-quarters of the audience have lapsed into coma. Engaging the listeners is an arcane artform to many administrators and lecturers, but new research from Dr Tim Clark and Dr David Greatbatch of King's College London offers hope for both speakers and their audiences. The two academics found that unlike politicians, who use rhetorical devices such as contrast and three-part lists - Education, Education, Education - to generate applause, top management gurus, such as Tom Peters, Rosabeth Moss Kanter and Gary Hamil, use humour to get their audience onside. \"The point about laughter,\" says Dr Clark, reader in management at KCL, \"is that it is an ambiguous response. People can either be laughing with you or at you, but no one in the audience can be sure exactly what someone else is feeling as the physical expression is the same, and the overall result is a positive feeling among the listeners. \"In presenting their ideas, charismatic management speakers often have to disparage practices that a great many of their listeners may be using and praise other working practices that their audience are unlikely to be using. The speakers are walking a tightrope: they want to get their message across, while both leaving the audience feeling good about themselves and keeping their reputations in tact. Laughter is an excellent way of achieving this.\" Dr Clark maintains that laughter is not an automatic response. Rather it is a response to predetermined stimuli. It is hard to be sure whether management gurus have an intuitive feel for what works and use laughter stimuli without being conscious they are doing so, or whether their talks are scripted down to the last pause. Dr Clark inclines to a mixture of the two, but whatever the case, he and Greatbatch have identified some commonly used signals that generate the laughter response. \"The methods include both verbal and non-verbal signals,\" he continues. \"There's a laughter smile, where the speaker bares his teeth, rolling the eyes, and even chuckling out loud. They also change the intonation of the voice, mimic people, or tell jokes and stories.\" The bottom line of getting a laugh is that it creates an illusion of a common viewpoint regardless of whether any consensus has actually been reached. As such it seems the ideal tactic for all those engaged in further education. Chris Moiser, a lecturer in biology and zoology at Plymouth College, is more than well aware that many lecturers fail to come up to the mark when it comes to engaging their students' attention. \"Some of the students are really enthusiastic and on the ball, others are struggling to keep up and some are only there because their parents will kill them if they don't turn up,\" he says. \"Somehow you've got to find a way of getting across specific information to all three groups at the same time, and it's very hard to do.\" So what tactics has Moiser employed to grab back an audience whose attention has begun to wander? \"I once pulled a ferret out of my trousers during a lecture on mammals,\" he continues, \"but one of the best diversions I saw was a speaker at a zoological meeting who suddenly bunged a slide into his presentation that read, 'All illegally parked cars will be clamped'. That woke everyone up.\" Pride of place, though, goes to one of Moiser's colleagues. \"Some years ago he used to include a picture of a scantily clad woman into his lecture slides,\" smiles Moiser, \"but he stopped when that sort of thing became un-PC. Still, there's a new round of redundancies in the offing and he's very keen to go, so he's told me that he might start including it again.\"",

      "trailText": "<p>The diary of a parent governor</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>When I started writing this column a few months ago, as a new parent governor, I received a couple of letters in the early weeks. They were not exactly fanmail. Their comments were more along the lines of \"Who is this fool?\" and \"How dare he besmirch the very serious and important work of governors with his ignorance and idiocy?\" </p> <p>I have a certain sympathy for that point of view. I was completely green. I was not even an \"educated layperson\", so far as having some knowledge of the functioning of school management or the role of governing bodies was concerned. But everyone has to start somewhere, don't they? Which is sort of the point of the experiment: how many parents who volunteer to become a governor have any real idea of what the job entails? </p> <p>The comparison between governors and magistrates (and I'm sorry to harp on if you've heard me say this before) strikes me as more and more valid. The difference is that magistrates are required to undergo both initial and continuing training. You might say that this is only right and proper, since they have other people's welfare in their hands - even the power to bestow custodial sentences. But governors, too, have people's welfare in their hands - your children's - and what responsibility could be greater than that? </p> <p>There is plenty of training available to governors, but none of it is mandatory. The local authority runs day courses for new governors, plus afternoon and evening classes for specific topics such as performance management. But, unless your school is exceptional in its tutorship of governors, you have to be self-starting, proactive and both willing and able to dedicate still more time than you had bargained for in order to find someone who will tell you what on earth you are for. </p> <p>I admit that I did not score enormously highly on any of these criteria. My visit to Joan's office (the school secretary, who doubles as clerk to the governing body) was brief and fruitless. </p> <p>Me: \"Do you know if there are any courses for new governors?\" </p> <p>Joan (harassed): \"Um, I don't know. I think there are some leaflets somewhere. Hold on.\" (Much shuffling of papers.) \"Er, here, have a look at this.\" (Hands me a wedge of documents.) </p> <p>Ten minutes of close scrutiny of sundry leaflets, flyers and pamphlets reveal that there are local authority courses for new governors. And the last one that term had been the previous week. </p> <p>Discouraged, I assumed I would pick up this governing business as I went along. But the truth is that, if you are not extraordinarily well- informed by some independent means, you are only half there in those meetings. An unscrupulous headteacher (which Mr Richardson fortunately is not; mildly depressive, possibly, but definitely not lacking in scruples), in league with a ruthless clerk, could run rings around a governing body comprising governors like me. We do plenty of rubber-stamping as it is. </p> <p>It was about time, I realised, to try again. I found I had a local authority bulletin with a governor support service number on it. There was just an answerphone, of course. But further scouring of the bulletin revealed a personal email address for someone. And so, finally, I obtained details of another course for governors, specifically of foundation schools, too (these are formerly \"grant-maintained\", which ours was). </p> <p>After several wrong turnings and dead ends, I found myself in an annexe to the imposing, if shabby, Edwardian pile of a town hall, in meeting room 3e, along with four other governors. Our \"teacher\" introduced herself as a former schools inspector. Mrs Evans had taken early retirement and now, she candidly admitted, did \"rather better\" doing education professional training as a freelance contractor. </p> <p>There followed a jog-trot through the regulations concerning the governance of foundation schools.

      "bodyText": "When I started writing this column a few months ago, as a new parent governor, I received a couple of letters in the early weeks. They were not exactly fanmail. Their comments were more along the lines of \"Who is this fool?\" and \"How dare he besmirch the very serious and important work of governors with his ignorance and idiocy?\" I have a certain sympathy for that point of view. I was completely green. I was not even an \"educated layperson\", so far as having some knowledge of the functioning of school management or the role of governing bodies was concerned. But everyone has to start somewhere, don't they? Which is sort of the point of the experiment: how many parents who volunteer to become a governor have any real idea of what the job entails? The comparison between governors and magistrates (and I'm sorry to harp on if you've heard me say this before) strikes me as more and more valid. The difference is that magistrates are required to undergo both initial and continuing training. You might say that this is only right and proper, since they have other people's welfare in their hands - even the power to bestow custodial sentences. But governors, too, have people's welfare in their hands - your children's - and what responsibility could be greater than that? There is plenty of training available to governors, but none of it is mandatory. The local authority runs day courses for new governors, plus afternoon and evening classes for specific topics such as performance management. But, unless your school is exceptional in its tutorship of governors, you have to be self-starting, proactive and both willing and able to dedicate still more time than you had bargained for in order to find someone who will tell you what on earth you are for. I admit that I did not score enormously highly on any of these criteria. My visit to Joan's office (the school secretary, who doubles as clerk to the governing body) was brief and fruitless. Me: \"Do you know if there are any courses for new governors?\" Joan (harassed): \"Um, I don't know. I think there are some leaflets somewhere. Hold on.\" (Much shuffling of papers.) \"Er, here, have a look at this.\" (Hands me a wedge of documents.) Ten minutes of close scrutiny of sundry leaflets, flyers and pamphlets reveal that there are local authority courses for new governors. And the last one that term had been the previous week. Discouraged, I assumed I would pick up this governing business as I went along. But the truth is that, if you are not extraordinarily well- informed by some independent means, you are only half there in those meetings. An unscrupulous headteacher (which Mr Richardson fortunately is not; mildly depressive, possibly, but definitely not lacking in scruples), in league with a ruthless clerk, could run rings around a governing body comprising governors like me. We do plenty of rubber-stamping as it is. It was about time, I realised, to try again. I found I had a local authority bulletin with a governor support service number on it. There was just an answerphone, of course. But further scouring of the bulletin revealed a personal email address for someone. And so, finally, I obtained details of another course for governors, specifically of foundation schools, too (these are formerly \"grant-maintained\", which ours was). After several wrong turnings and dead ends, I found myself in an annexe to the imposing, if shabby, Edwardian pile of a town hall, in meeting room 3e, along with four other governors. Our \"teacher\" introduced herself as a former schools inspector. Mrs Evans had taken early retirement and now, she candidly admitted, did \"rather better\" doing education professional training as a freelance contractor. There followed a jog-trot through the regulations concerning the governance of foundation schools. The document she handed out was the usual bullet-point summary, bewildering in its staccato listing of policies, strategies, aims and objectives. In education, a particular species of bureaucratic language conspires to make all official documents virtually unreadable: it is, I think, an unholy hybrid of Whitehall statute-speak and management consultancy jargon. But through Mrs Evans's presentation, all kinds of interesting matters arise. The first revelation is that the governing body of foundation schools not only employs the staff and controls admissions, but also owns the land and buildings of the school. Crikey, how come no one had ever mentioned this basic fact to me? I leave the session feeling slightly blitzed by having to think hard about standing orders and strategic roles, but also energised. I feel it's just the beginning of my training, and I could do with much more. Above all, I feel inspired by Mrs Evans's speech about governors being responsible for seeing that their school has a wider definition of \"standards\" than merely Sats results and numbers of exclusions. I even have a list of things I want to raise at the next governors' meeting. I might actually be more than half there.",

      "body": "<p>The small boy with the bowlcut hair is scribbling over his drawing of a cow with a stubby blue crayon. \"It's mud\" he announces. \"Very good,\" I say, encouragingly. This morning, I am masquerading as a classroom assistant. The government has announced that it intends to increase their ranks in order to take some of the strain off overworked teaching staff, and so here I am, sitting on an infant-sized chair, anticipating a busy morning of washing out paint pots and maybe sticking a plaster on the odd grazed knee. </p> <p>This is how we think of the classroom assistant: as someone - a parent, perhaps - who pops in on the odd afternoon and lends a hand in the reading hour. Nothing too vexing. </p> <p>But the role has changed substantially over the years. Unison senior national officer for school staff, Christina McAnea, claims that classroom assistants \"play an increasingly vital part in the drive to raise standards in schools. And yet they are too often overlooked or ignored.\" </p> <p>This is the reception class at Kilmorie Primary School, in Forest Hill, south London. One of the children explains to me that, although some of the class are five years old, herself included, some of them are only four, but this does not prevent them being friends. I nod sagely, whilst attempting to control the minor scuffle which has broken out over the alphabet butterfly jigsaw puzzle. </p> <p>The teacher is reading a story about Mrs Wishy-washy, and we are all joining in. There are two classroom assistants, Pat and Coleen, who keep an eye on the group, whispering to them when their attention strays from the Wishy-washing and the cow in the mud. When the story is over, we all shake our hands to get rid of the fidgets. Then we're writing on the board. \"Capital letter, capital T,\" says the teacher. A fluffy-headed blond boy goes to write the letter C. We clap. \"What is 'wuh' in Letterland?\" the teacher asks. And then we are drawing letter 'm's in the air, \"Down, up, over, over, flip\". </p> <p>The class is split into groups, each group overseen by a different classroom assistant. Some of the children are playing on the computer, some are glueing words onto paper in a comprehension exercise, and others are tipping over the box of crayons and loudly pretending to be holding mobile phone conversations. Mine is this last group; I am fast realising that being a classroom assistant involves bucketloads of patience. One boy shows me his drawing. \"Is it a, errr... pig?\" I ask. The pig has nine legs, and is next to the duck, which is pink. </p> <p>In response to last week's proposals, Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the NUT, remarked: \"The government must try not to obscure the need to improve pupil-teacher ratios by increasing the number of adults to pupils in our schools.\" The classroom assistants at Kilmorie agree. </p> <p>\"There aren't enough teachers and that's why we're doing a lot more work,\" says one. Sharon Gooddy, another classroom assistant, is more blunt: \"It's cheap teaching.\" </p> <p>In the case of a statemented child, the classroom assistant has to go to the child's review, and is asked to write a report and to keep daily records on the child. This, they say, is not too problematic for a single child, but there could be 16 statemented children, leaving only half an hour to be spent with each child. Then there's also the physical side of the job, \"the primary helper tasks - taking them to the toilets, changing pants_\" Much of the job resembles teaching: they must plan lessons and are working with what one assistant terms \"the high percentage of needy children\" at the school. </p> <p>\"Teachers are trained before they go into the job,\" says Sharon, \"but helpers are trained on the job. We've all had to learn sign language, and we've children with Downs Syndrome and a lot with English as a second language.\" </p> <p>They have also had to become familiar with computers. Fortunately the school has trained them and they have been able to follow NVQ courses. \"But,\" says Jo Ives, \"you don't want to do the work out of school, because you're not paid enough.\" </p> <p>Pay is a big issue. \"If the government is serious about recruiting additional classroom assistants, they must take a long, hard look at training and pay,\" says McAnea, and the classroom assistants at Kilmorie agree that pay, or the lack of it, is a problem: \"Every year, the job changes, the hours change, and we only get half-pay in the holidays.\" </p> <p>It is only recently that assistants, who were classified as manual workers, have become \"office workers\"; it is a shift which has earned them an extra 70p an hour. They have also encountered difficulties with the local education board - \"they dropped us two pay scales with out telling us.\" Fortunately, the school rallied round; they now have had their pay scale reinstated and also receive a London weighting. Nevertheless, one of the assistants is leaving for a job in administration. \"We're losing Joy because this job means she doesn't have enough money or security to get a mortgage,\" Sharon says. </p> <p>But they are very happy at Kilmorie. Ken Johnson, Kilmorie's headteacher, explains that classroom assistants are trained both on the job and upstairs in the school's professional development centre. They learn about the numeracy and literacy strategies and are trained in dealing with special educational needs. \"Primary helpers support learning,\" he says, \"but it would be wholly inappropriate for them to be used as replacement teachers; the roles are distinctly different.\" </p> <p>You can see this in the classroom. While the teacher is telling her class about story sequence - \"now that's quite a big word, but that means what happens at the beginning, middle and end . . .\" - her assistants are busy spotting who hasn't yet answered a question, hushing the natterers and pointing out that perhaps the little boy whose glasses are broken should swap places with someone nearer the front. \"We used to be called primary helpers, and now we are teaching assistants,\" says Jo Ives. \"We used to mount work, make tea and wash paint pots, but now we work with the teacher, we work as a team.\"</p>",

The Palace Theatre in Westcliff on Sea will use six directors and 25 actors for the 135 performances. 3. Christie is the best-selling mystery novelist of all time, having flogged more than 2 billion books. 4. But it took her nearly six years to find a publisher for her first book, The Mysterious Affair at Styles. 5. Once started, she clocked them up fast. She wrote 66 books and 145 short stories. 6. She also sneakily churned out six romance novels under the nom de plume of Mary Westmacott. 7. Christie picked up her knowledge of poison - her preferred murder weapon - while working in a WW1 hospital. 8. Despite not being short of a shilling, Christie never owned her own TV, but her grandson Matthew Prichard reckons she would have embraced the internet had she been around now. 9. Captain Arthur Hastings is the most popular Christie character in Iceland Poirot's valet George is second best. 10. A librarian in Newfoundland - where it is clearly too cold to get out much - has written standalone biographies of Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple http://www.angelfire.com/fl/christianx/agatha.html",

      "bodyText": "Prison chic is out, cabin fever is in for Big Brother 2 - the interior of the Channel 4 show's house has been given a Changing Rooms-style makeover for its return later this month. Wood panelling, rugs and a central log fire have replaced the spartan, prefab look of last summer's first series, giving the house an altogether more friendly and welcoming feel. Big Brother's producer, Endemol Entertainment UK, has also built a mystery pyramid-shaped structure in the garden of the house. Series producer Jeremy Phillips confirmed that the structure would have cameras inside and could be used for some of the tasks Big Brother contestants are asked to perform. But Mr Phillips would reveal nothing more about the new feature when journalists got their first look at the revamped Big Brother house today, leaving them to speculate that it might be a sauna. Other changes include the enlargement of the main room, a decked patio in the garden and an en-suite bathroom with a whirlpool bath in one of the bedrooms. This will add to the friction and petty jealousies that will inevitably consume the group over nine weeks. The redesign has been overseen by Colin Piggott, who was also behind the look of the first run of the show. Around 350 production staff will be working at the Three Mills Studio in Bow, east London, dubbed \"the new Soho\" by Channel 4's commissioning editor for Big Brother, Liz Warner. The nightly weekday edition of Big Brother on Channel 4 is expected to go out from 10pm from Sunday, May 25. There will also be two eviction night shows on Friday night, a 60-minute weekly show looking at the behaviour of contestants and a weekend round-up. E4 is to broadcast a live feed from the Big Brother house for up to 21 hours a day, beginning when the main nightly Channel 4 show ends and running through to 5.30pm the next day. There will also be a 30-minute daily Big Brother studio show on E4 presented by Dermot O'Leary, featuring interviews with evictees, as well as friends, relatives, celebrities, journalists and psychologists. Users of the Big Brother website will be able to access two new features: the \"Fave Cam\" - a video stream following the most popular housemate; and \"Pan Cam\", a panoramic camera mounted in the circular dining table that can be rotated through 360 degrees by users.

Equality of racial justice and hostility to ethnic discrimination were ideals that united old and new Labour. To men like Tony Blair and Jack Straw they were articles of faith, which lay behind both the swift abolition of the Tories' primary-purpose rule challenging migrant spouses to prove they had any right to join their partners, and the later setting up of the Stephen Lawrence inquiry. To Blair and Straw it is unimaginable that they could be party to anything but the most impeccable correctness in all matters that touch on race.</p> <p>Yet they have been. Two weeks ago, I wrote about the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000, which outlawed ethnic discrimination by public authorities but made an exception for the immigration service. I unearthed a ministerial order which authorised immigration officers to treat people of certain nationalities - unspecified, but to be identified at the future decision of ministers and officials - worse than other people. Replying to the critique, Straw pleaded a mere drafting technicality and termed my attack \"bizarre\".</p> <p>But this order was only a beginning. There has now been a second one, dated April 23, which extends the reach from nationalities to what it describes, in its own headline, as \"discrimination on ground of ethnic or national origin\". This time the ethnics in question are listed: \"a) Kurd, b) Roma, c) Albanian, d) Tamil, e) Pontic Greek, f) Somali, g) Afghan\". All persons of these origins are now to be subject \"to a more rigorous examination than other persons in the same circumstances\". They can be detained, questioned and rejected, as a class, more freely than other people because they are now deemed prima facie more likely to be illegal immigrants or bogus asylum-seekers.</p> <p>They have something else in common, however. There is no Kurdish passport, there is no Roma passport. Identifying these people can be attempted through little more than their personal appearance, plus some inference from the flight or possibly boat they arrive on. So, not only is the bar on collective discrimination being ditched, but a peculiarly vicious form of sorting is written into statute, whereby immigration officers herd together anyone who looks like a Kurd or a Tamil or a Pontic Greek - regardless of whether these come, as Tamils do, from Sri Lanka, Canada, India or even the UK - and impose special oppression on them.</p> <p>Ministers' handling of this law went through two phases. The first, during passage, was to pretend it was benign. The only purpose they cited was to make it easier to discriminate in favour of, say, Kosovan refugees. When pressed by Liberal Democrats such as Lord Lester, that was the scenario they repeatedly mentioned. They were lying. It is quite apparent from the April 23 order that what they wanted all along was the power to authorise state-sponsored mass exclusion of certain ethnic groups, without regard for individual justice, on a scale never before seen in this country.</p> <p>Phase two came last week. The new law, said Barbara Roche, Straw's minion in charge of immigration, was merely giving formal shape to a practice that had been going on a long time. She was almost flippant in her incredulity that anyone should complain about a long-established pattern of ethnic selection. She talked about the need for \"objective evidence\" against each migrant. But no one has explained how a Roma is meant to overcome the ethnic evidence against him, especially in view of the further sub-clause in the order which states, almost incredibly: \"If the information [needed to pursue an application to enter] is not available in a language which the person understands, it is not necessary to provide the information in a language which he does understand.\"</p> <p>Three conclusions can be drawn from this. First, whether or not ethnic selection went on before, it has now been systematised. If an apparent Kurd, or potential Roma, or notional Pontic Greek has by some oversight not been discriminated against, ministers may want to know the reason why. Immigration controllers are now on formal notice as to which ethnic and national origins are especially unwelcome in Britain. Their conduct will be policed by someone called a \"race monitor\", but only retrospectively and without attention to individual cases. The monitor is plainly a PR stooge in the making.</p> <p>Second, as the government's contribution to present discontents over asylum, this is political cowardice on a grand scale. No one disputes the need for immigration control. But faced by the mighty force of Ann Widdecombe, Blair and Straw are evidently terrified of electoral punishment if they can't match her rhetoric of national alarm with measures of ethnic hostility. Though all these politicians avow their respect for genuine cases, it's the tritest lip service. Straw collaborates with Widdecombe in a discourse from which only the Lib Dems stand aside, that stigmatises asylum itself as presumptively a bogus concept, eating away at the resources of the fifth largest economy in the world.</p> <p>Third, something unpleasant has happened to Labour in power. For all sorts of reasons, they need to win the election. I hope they do. They're the only plausible choice on offer and defend several important policies that will probably, given time, make this country a better place. But their immigration regime shows not only that they've become, in a vital area, as bad as the Tories, but that they have lost their intellectual as well as moral faculties. They appear not to know what they're doing. They sincerely believe they do not favour ethnic discrimination. Straw, the posturing anti-racist, thinks any challenge to his law can only be \"bizarre\". He is surrounded by a party that seems to believe the same - barely a squeak came out of it when the law went through.</p> <p>Such, it seems, is today's corruption of power: not so much a conspiracy of self-interest as the building of a wall of righteous self-belief. A power-driven certainty that, because one is who one is, one can by definition do no wrong. This law of ethnic punishment is a disgrace. Perhaps only a party infused by belief in its own anti-racism would have the nerve to smuggle it past the frontier that separates a decent country from a shameful one.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:hugoyoung@compuserve.com\">hugoyoung@compuserve.com</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "The BBC flew in a team. So did the Mail on Sunday. A Mirror journalist who had been on another assignment in South America was also switched to Rio, although he flew home on Saturday night, missing the big event on Sunday afternoon. When Ronnie Biggs arrived in white mini-van - complete with a freshly painted Sun logo - at Rio de Janeiro airport at around 3pm on Sunday the pack of journalists waiting was about 50 strong. The international news agencies were represented as were all the main Brazilian TV channels, although there were no live feeds since airport rules prohibit it. As soon as the van parked in Terminal Two's disabled space, Biggs could be seen in the middle of the second row and Bruce and Nick Reynolds were in the back. The other passengers in suits were looking hot, sweaty and nervous - presumably journalists from the Sun. But the press surrounded the van making it impossible for the airport staff who were waiting to help Biggs onto an airport wheelchair. The van sped off, chased by photographers. Ten minutes later the head of airport security informed the press pack that the van had driven to Terminal One where Biggs had got out and he was already in the area restricted for those who are about to fly. Geoff Cowling, the consul general of the British consulate in Rio, was seen with a Sun reporter walking through the departure gates. Mr Cowling has free access as a diplomat but the Sun journalist showed no documentation, identity tag or boarding pass as he walked through into the restricted area, raising questions about an extraordinary sweetheart deal struck with a tabloid newspaper. While the British consulate appeared to be bending over backwards to work for the Sun, they left everyone else in the wilderness. Officials refused to divulge any relevant information to journalists belonging to any other media organisation - diverting all enquiries to a press officer in Brasilia. It was left to the Brazilian authorities to relay everything that happened to Biggs as he was going through the airport's official procedures. Clovis Franco, press officer for the federal police, witnessed the 45-minute interview that Biggs and his son Mike were obliged to have with police officers. Mr Franco released a copy of Biggs declaration that he was leaving of his own free will as soon as it was typed. The flight plan - to Cape Verde for refuelling and then to RAF Northolt - was also released by the Brazilian authorities. One Brazilian journalist, Antonio Werneck, of Rio daily O Globo, managed to gain access to the restricted area and snapped a quick shot on a small camera of Mike Biggs wheeling his father, accompanied by Mr Cowling. Sources present say that Mike was very aggressive and almost hit Mr Werneck, shouting: \"You can't take a picture because it will be sold all over the world.\" The picture was sold all over the world and on the cover of yesterday's Telegraph, Independent and Times. The picture was also in the Brazilian media, although the reports of Biggs' flight home was overshadowed by other domestic stories. Brazilians are as intrigued by the international interest in the story as they are by the story itself. Ronnie Biggs always remained more of a household name in the UK than he ever was in Brazil. In Biggs' declaration to the federal police he thanked the Brazilian government and people for their hospitality and said he one day hoped to return.

With the Easter holidays blighted by foot and mouth disease, the weekend offered hope as visitor numbers rose. A safari park in Scotland and a Cardiff museum even had to turn people away. But as some restrictions on walking remained in place, things were not yet back to normal in many areas. The roads were busier this weekend than at Easter, the AA said. Traffic was heavy on a number of coastal routes, especially on the south coast east of Devon. Sunshine brought tourists back to the North York Moors national park, where foot and mouth had cut visitor numbers by half. At Northumberland national park, a spokesman said the weather had brought the crowds back, but there was only 70% of the number of visitors that came on last May's bank holiday. Roads to the Lake District, where tourism has been badly damaged by the countryside crisis, were busy but not congested. In Scotland, roads in the north and west were particularly busy as temperatures inland and in the Highlands continued to rise from the weekend highs. By noon staff at Blair Drummond safari and adventure park, near Stirling, were discouraging visitors after queues three miles long built up at its three entrances. Its chief executive, Bob Fotheringham, said: \"We want people to come here and enjoy themselves, but there is serious traffic congestion.\" The Museum of Welsh Life in Cardiff had to close its doors after more than 12,000 visitors turned up. Helen Jones, spokeswoman for the museum, which is holding its annual May fair with traditional dancing, rural crafts and a Victorian fair, said it had reached capacity. \"I think the success is a combination of beautiful weather and the fact that we now operate a free for all policy,\" she said. \"Also, people know that the museum is definitely open.\" At Snowdon, officials were delighted with the public's response after four paths to the summit were reopened for the first time since the foot and mouth crisis began.

      "body": "<p>There are two stories of British higher education. The first is one of triumph. British higher education enjoys the best of both worlds. It has become the largest producer of graduates in Europe, and the British people enjoy unprecedented levels of access to higher education. And yet it still embodies a commitment to excellence and high standards which extends far beyond a dying nostalgia for elitist values - a higher education that acts mass but thinks elite. </p> <p>British universities and colleges are delicately balanced between old and new. Innovation has been embraced, tradition preserved. But perhaps that balance cannot be held. Two \"falls\" are possible. Either this curious \"elite-mass\" system will prove incapable of further expansion and adaptation and, as a result, be out-flanked by novel and rival forms of higher education that are mass in spirit as well as form; or the system will slough off its elite characteristics as budgets decline and more abrasive and urgent imperatives emerge. </p> <p>But, for the moment, the achievement of British higher education deserves to be celebrated. One form of British exceptionalism - low levels of participation, with access inequitably rationed - has been replaced by another - much higher levels of participation, which approximate to those in other developed countries without compromising the integrity of traditional academic culture. That is British higher education's first story. </p> <p><strong> Autonomy eroded </strong><br> </p> <p> The second story is one of retreat and even defeat. In 1960 British higher education was regarded as exceptional in another sense: although overwhelmingly dependent on public funding, it enjoyed a very high level of autonomy. </p> <p>Buffered from the state by that uniquely British institution, the Uni versity Grants Committee (UGC), our universities enjoyed far greater freedom than universities in the rest of the world. As late as 1981 ministers received almost no advance warning of the grants committee's allocations as deep, and selective, cuts were made in university budgets. </p> <p>But the exceptional degree of autonomy apparently possessed by British universities during the high-noon of the grants-committee era reflected two special factors which could not be sustained indefinitely - first, the collusive character of post-war elites; and second, the strong political consensus that prevailed during this period, the so-called \"post-war settlement\". Large parts of British higher education lay outside the grants-committee sector: the polytechnics (now the \"new\" universities) and teacher training. </p> <p>Exaggerated or not, this autonomy has certainly been eroded. Accountability has been tightened by a rapid series of acronymic shifts. The UGC was abolished and replaced by the Universities Funding Council. This was partnered by the Polytechnics and Colleges Funding Council, which emerged after the eviction of local education authorities from higher education. Neither lasted long. </p> <p>Today the boss agency is the Higher Education Funding Council for England (Hefce) and its analogous agencies in Scotland and Wales. Almost nothing is left of the \"donnish dominion\". </p> <p>There is more. The academic culture that flourished in Britain's universities in the third quarter of the 20th century was exceptionally vibrant, despite the universities' corporate conservatism. The revolution in biological sciences and the intoxication of the social sciences promised extraordinarily powerful alliances between fundamental science and public intellectuals. That promise, too, has faded. </p> <p>First came the ideological revanche of Thatcherism. Then the remorseless bureaucracies of academic accountability - the Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) and Quality Assurance Agency - further eroded those crucial margins of irresponsibility and creativity. This is the second story: a retreat certainly, and perhaps even a defeat. </p> <p><strong> Two paradoxes</strong><br> </p> <p> These two stories, both true, confront us with two paradoxes. First, a higher education that acts mass but thinks elite. Second, a higher education system that is both opening, in terms of its social reach, and (maybe) closing, in terms of its intellectual ambitions. The two may be connected - not because \"more means worse\" or because access and excellence are a zero-sum game, but because the dissonance be tween mass form and elite mentality may have led to intellectual closure. </p> <p>The big question is whether this elite-mass system is capable of extension and elaboration, or whether it has reached the limits of its potential. The answers to more detailed questions - on structure, funding and quality - depend on this. If future growth is likely to take place outside the sector, there is little point tinkering with the structure of higher education. Also, the choice between different funding and quality regimes will depend on whether higher education is still seen as a public service or is to be treated as a semi-privatised sector of the \"knowledge industry\". </p> <p>Expansion is the key. The government is committed to raising participation to 50% from today's 33%. But the most important drivers of expansion appear largely external to the higher education system. One is the government's commitment to raising standards in schools; another is the perceived need to provide the skills for a knowledge-based economy. </p> <p>Two components of the govern ment's strategy reflect these drivers. The first is the decision to establish two-year foundation degrees. The second is the development of alternative institutions uncluttered with the \"academic\" baggage which burdens existing universities. The University for Industry, now Learn Direct, comes to mind. Some of this expansion may also be channelled through other forms of \"virtual\" university, either joint ventures by existing universities or public-private partnerships, or through corporate universities. </p> <p>Perhaps a new binary division is developing - not a hierarchical division between more and less noble higher education institutions, but between public-sector, public-service higher education and new providers, whether novel vehicles like theUniversity for Industry, spin-offs of traditional institutions, public-private alliances or corporate universities. If this happened, the relationship between the two halves of this neo-binary system would be crucial - rivalry or synergy? </p> <p>However, even within the present system, pressure for change is building up. First comes the reviving debate about restructuring. We all have to be collaborators now. But should higher education be remodelled top-down along the lines of Wisconsin, where 26 universities are linked under a single governing body and divide up the academic labour between them, or will more chaotic forms of collaboration between institutions emerge? Each week there is a headline about a new alliance. Which are real, which a sham? </p> <p>The second is the devolutionary dynamic. The most high-profile example is the abolition of tuition fees for Scottish-domiciled students in Scottish universities. But equally significant, although less political, is the emergence of a stronger regional dimension in England after the creation of regional development agencies. </p> <p>Third, the future organisation of research remains unresolved. The traditional dual-support system has been undermined - by the RAE, which has externalised the universities' internal research priorities, and by the increasingly dirigisme and instrumentalism of the research councils, under pressure from the Office of Science and Technology (OST). The funding councils are fighting a dogged battle to defend their stake in research by conducting a \"fundamental review\" of the research assessment exercise (partly a re-engineering of the process but largely a re-justification). The outcome is unclear. </p> <p><strong> Non-state money </strong><br> </p> <p> But the implications for the character of institutions and the shape of the system are important. The future of funding in British higher education is similarly clouded. The state is the majority stake-holder in higher education - and likely to remain so indefinitely despite the encouragement universities have received to diversify their income. But the prospects for a significant uplift in public expenditure on universities are bleak. The government, nominally Labour, has lost heart in social democracy (never mind socialism). But because it is nominally Labour, the prospects for more radical forms of privatisation are also slight. </p> <p>The probable scenario for future funding, therefore, is a system still largely dependent on public expenditure and subject to perennial \"efficiency gains\", but increasingly encouraged to form entrepreneurial alliances with the private sector and to generate more non-state income. </p> <p>But more radical approaches to funding cannot be discounted. After all, the traditional pattern of \"free\" higher education available to all those who were willing and qualified - the Robbins formula influenced by the National Health Service - was dismantled with ease during the 1990s. </p> <p>But the question \"can Britain's elite-mass system survive?\" is of more than local significance. It matters not only in Britain, where the transition to a mass-universal system would strain existing structures, but also for the wider potential for building a democratic system of higher education. </p> <p>In the US very high levels of participation have been produced by the incorporation of all types of post-secondary education within a highly stratified higher education system. In (nearly all) the rest of Europe expansion has taken place within traditional binary structures which protect, and privilege, traditional universities. Only in Britain has an attempt been made to increase social opportunities for higher education through a system that retains traditional academic attributes in nearly all institutions, and not just in a segregated elite sector.

      "body": "<p>The Co-op Bank has for the first time put a price on its ethical stance - and claims to be showing a profit. </p> <p>Its positions on issues such as the arms trade and renewable energy made it \u00a316m better off last year. That is about 16% of pre-tax profit, and comes after extra costs of more than \u00a32m. </p> <p>The figures are published today in the bank's fourth annual \"Partnership report\", which details financial, ethical and environmental performance in 2000. </p> <p>Introducing the report, chief executive Mervyn Pedelty says the bank's distinctive position had been important in producing a seventh successive year of increased profits. Mr Pedelty says ethics are just one aspect of the bank's brand. But in the first cost-benefit exercise of its kind, marketing and finance specialists have estimated that these values are responsible for between 15% and 18% of the \u00a396m pre-tax profit. </p> <p>The figures are based on detailed analysis of the Co-op brand value, and market research findings from Mori that more than a quarter of current account customers cited ethics or the environment as the reason for opening their accounts. </p> <p>Paul Monahan, the partnership development manager, said the results demonstrated the business case for sustainable development. \"People often claim that ethical business is good business, but nobody has had hard numbers before.\" </p> <p>The extra profits are despite turning down 105 of the 270 referrals to the bank's policy unit, mostly because of the ecological impact of the applicant's business. This is estimated to have cost the bank \u00a31.7m in lost profits.

      "bodyText": "The Co-op Bank has for the first time put a price on its ethical stance - and claims to be showing a profit. Its positions on issues such as the arms trade and renewable energy made it \u00a316m better off last year. That is about 16% of pre-tax profit, and comes after extra costs of more than \u00a32m. The figures are published today in the bank's fourth annual \"Partnership report\", which details financial, ethical and environmental performance in 2000. Introducing the report, chief executive Mervyn Pedelty says the bank's distinctive position had been important in producing a seventh successive year of increased profits. Mr Pedelty says ethics are just one aspect of the bank's brand. But in the first cost-benefit exercise of its kind, marketing and finance specialists have estimated that these values are responsible for between 15% and 18% of the \u00a396m pre-tax profit. The figures are based on detailed analysis of the Co-op brand value, and market research findings from Mori that more than a quarter of current account customers cited ethics or the environment as the reason for opening their accounts. Paul Monahan, the partnership development manager, said the results demonstrated the business case for sustainable development. \"People often claim that ethical business is good business, but nobody has had hard numbers before.\" The extra profits are despite turning down 105 of the 270 referrals to the bank's policy unit, mostly because of the ecological impact of the applicant's business. This is estimated to have cost the bank \u00a31.7m in lost profits. On the other hand efforts to reduce the use of paper have saved nearly \u00a33m. Mr Monahan said the bank's energy bills show that many businesses overestimate the cost of going green. Using renewable energy in all the main office locations has added an annual cost of just \u00a341,000. This has allowed the bank to achieve its target of cutting the carbon dioxide emissions it is responsible for by 60% since 1997 - three times the government's 20% reduction target. In the current year the bank will benefit from national insurance savings following the introduction of the climate change levy. Mr Monahan said this would cancel the extra energy costs. \"It means we will have gone green and saved money.\" The report details progress against 68 targets set last year. Of these, 47 have been completely achieved but no progress has been made on 10. Most significant is the failure to persuade staff that their salaries and benefits are good enough. The bank has missed its target of getting 70% of staff to agree that salaries are at least \"quite good\".

      "body": "<p>Earlier today, I saw the Queen at Buckingham Palace to ask for a dissolution of parliament so that there can be a general election on June 7.</p> <p>Every vote in this election is precious. No-one's support should ever be assumed. That is the strength of our democracy.</p> <p>We earned the trust of the people in 1997 - after 18 long years of opposition.</p> <p>Today we have to earn that trust again.</p> <p>I stand before you today with a sense both of humility and of hope.</p> <p>Humility, because though we can take pride in many achievements since May 1997, we know we still have so much to do, so many challenges still to overcome; and we know also that though we have striven at all times for your trust, there have been times of difficulty too.</p> <p>Hope, because in every area of our national life that we promised change, however much remains to do, there are also the foundations laid for a brighter future, real progress, beacons lit showing us a better way.</p> <p>Four years ago, you gave us, New Labour, a majority larger than I, or anyone else, believed you would. That large majority was never a reason to do the job quickly. It added the responsibility to do it properly, for the long term.</p> <p>No government of change, in any country I can think of, has done it all in one programme, one budget, or one term. Four years has given us the chance to build foundations. But now the work must go on. There is a lot done, a lot more to do and a lot at stake in this election, which offers a more fundamental choice between the two main parties than for many years.</p> <p>So what are these foundations and what must we build upon them?</p> <p>The achievement that has most gladdened our supporters and surprised our doubters has been our economic record.</p> <p>This is a New Labour government pursuing economic prosperity and social justice together.</p> <p>Today, Britain is the fourth largest economy in the world. With the lowest inflation in Europe, mortgage rates half of what they were in the 80s and 90s, and more people in work than ever before, living standards are rising. It didn't happen by chance, but because we took the tough decisions needed to lay the foundations of economic stability.</p> <p>Now we must go further, meet the challenge of economic change sweeping the world, and give our people the skills, the technology, the know-how, so that everyone gets the chance not just of a job, but of a career, able to earn a decent living and to make the most of themselves.</p> <p>Nothing is possible without that basic, hard-won economic stability. When we came to power in May 1997, Britain spent more on interest payments on the National Debt than we spent on schools. We worked hard to put our country*s house in order.</p> <p>This year, because of the difficult choices we made in our first two years, we will spend \u00a310bn more on schools. There is a different set of priorities in our country today.</p> <p>When we had the money to invest, we were clear what the number 1 priority would be. Education. Education. Education. The priority then, now and in the future.</p> <p>In nurseries and primary schools in particular, we have seen real progress as real investment and change has taken place. In 1997, barely 50% of 11 year olds passed their tests. This year, it will be almost 80%.</p> <p>But now the same step-change must be driven through our secondary schools and universities, so that we end once and for all the old sense of resignation among too many in Britain that their children can't get ahead. that there are two systems of education, one for the privileged, the other narrow and steep for the rest of the young.</p> <p>In the NHS, waiting lists are lower, new hospitals are being built, there are 17,000 more nurses. Visit many A &amp; E departments or use NHS Direct and you can see change. But we still have much further to go, if we are to see the NHS rebuilt according to its founding principle of quality health care available on the basis of need, not ability to pay.</p> <p>Crime has fallen 10% since 1997 and police numbers after falling for a decade are now rising again. But drug abuse still blights too many lives. Violent crime still threatens too many communities. So progress, but again, further to go before, with the new investment, we have the largest ever number of police officers Britain has seen.</p> <p>The New Deal has shown that governments can make a difference in the fight against unemployment. Our programme of welfare reform has led to benefit bills falling in real terms for the first time in decades. At the same time, the minimum wage has lifted the pay of hundreds of thousands.</p> <p>But we know that there are still one in six non-pensioner homes with no-one working; and still, despite the recent rises in pension, and the winter allowance, we need to reward our pensioners who have saved hard all their lives. Full employment for our generation and security for that of our parents and grandparents.</p> <p>In other areas like transport or inner city regeneration, there are plans for investment and renewal, but we are acutely aware of how big the challenge is that lies ahead.</p> <p>Through devolution, a new partnership that has strengthened the United Kingdom and a peace process in Northern Ireland that offers the only hope of a peaceful future. But again much more to do.</p> <p>So the work goes on and now I seek a mandate not simply for more of the same; I seek a fresh mandate for radical change.</p> <p>Most people, quite rightly, do not pass their time immersed in politics.</p> <p>They have the bills to pay, the job to do, the family to raise, the thousand different pressures of everyday life with which to contend. But a general election is different. It is a chance to explain, to engage in a sustained argument about the big issues, and about the country's destiny and direction. The decision as to who governs is a fundamental one for any nation. So in an election that dialogue is possible. People listen. They hear the arguments.</p> <p>I will travel to every part of the country, not just defending our record, but arguing for the changes our country needs. The spine of my campaign will be a series of speeches that set out the challenge facing the country, and the reforms needed to meet them.</p> <p>It's great that we have stable economic management. But it's not enough. We need a step-change in productivity, skills and enterprise. And we need reform to deliver it.</p> <p>I'm proud that we're getting in record investment in our schools and hospitals. But it's not just money our public services need, but real reform to make that money work, and make our public services work for the people who depend on them.</p> <p>It's a step in the right direction to get police numbers rising again. But on it's own, that's not enough. Not when we have a 19th century criminal justice system coping with 21st century crime.</p> <p>It's an achievement that we have the welfare bills falling. But there are still too many people not working who could be, and so continuing welfare reform will be essential to our second term agenda.</p> <p>I'm proud too that Britain is no longer marginalised and isolated in Europe. But we are not yet the leading nation in Europe that our weight, prosperity and history demand.</p> <p>As New Labour, we seek a mandate not just for continuity but for change, for a Britain, strong, modern and fair.</p> <p>We seek a mandate to make all the reforms necessary to strengthen, modernise and revitalise our schools and hospitals.</p> <p>We seek a mandate for investment. Investment to extend opportunities. Ending years of cut backs that denied young people the chance to get on.</p> <p>We seek a mandate for further reform of the welfare state. To make the tax and benefit system reward work, tackle poverty and penalise irresponsibility.</p> <p>We seek a mandate to make Britain stronger - stronger because we are engaged with Europe and the wider world, showing our leadership, not in retreat.</p> <p>But it is a choice that I cannot make alone. The challenge is there for you as well as me. For I see the differences between the main two parties as more stark than at any time since 1983.</p> <p>For we know today's Conservative party would take us back, back to negative equity, high mortgage rates and boom and bust; back to cuts in public services; back to social division; back to the margins of influence in Europe and the wider world.</p> <p>So there is a choice. This election is about which party can be trusted with the economy, which party will invest more in our public services, which party is capable of leading Britain into the future.</p> <p>We have made our choice. It won't be easy. Nothing good ever is.</p> <p>You all know that any success you have ever had in life, whether an exam passed or a promotion gained, has had its mixture of tough choices, personal application and even pain.</p> <p>But afterwards, comes the fulfilment of a great goal achieved. And my goal at this election is this: it is not just to win your vote, but to win your support, win your heart and mind in the fight for change that I am leading. And it is change for a purpose: to create a society and nation, where everyone, not just the privileged few, gets the chance to succeed.</p> <p>We have all heard the term \"people in their place\". I say to you today; we must reach a time, in our time, when the only rightful place for every man, woman and child in Britain is where their talents take them.</p> <p>So the great issue of this election is opportunity for all, not just the few. This election is about a radical vision of lifting barriers and liberating people*s potential in a decent society, where everyone gets the chance to make the most of their God-given talent.</p> <p>We stand:</p> <p>For more investment, not less,</p> <p>Economic stability the foundation,</p> <p>Schools and hospitals first,</p> <p>Radical reforms and equal chances.</p> <p>Britain is a great nation. It has so many strengths. But its biggest strength is its people. They, you young people here today, are the nation's potential. This is the time, and ours is the task, to set your talents free and build a land of hope and opportunity for all.</p> <p>Now you, the people, will decide. <br><br><b>Video</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/video/blair.rm\">Watch Tony Blair's election announcement (from the BBC)</a></p> <p><b>Full text</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Politics/election2001/story/0,9029,487681,00.html\">Tony Blair's election speech</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br><a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/election2001/comment/0,9407,487297,00.html\">08.05.2001: It's painful to be a Tory</a><br> <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/election2001/comment/0,9407,487349,00.html\">08.05.2001: Soundbite truths </a><br> <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/election2001/story/0,9029,487397,00.html\">08.05.2001: Tory 'meltdown' on cards, claim Lib Dems</a><br> <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/election2001/comment/0,9407,487350,00.html\">08.05.2001: Women lose ground</a><br> <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/election2001/comment/0,9407,486830,00.html\">06.05.2001, Andrew Rawnsley: Ready to go to the people</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br> <a href=\"http://politicstalk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee82ba8\">Is another big Labour victory good for democracy?</a><br> <a href=\"http://politicstalk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee82baa\">The Tories - should we kick them while they're down?</a><br> <a href=\"http://politicstalk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee82bb0\">Election fever - but what are the issues the parties and the media are overlooking?</a><br> <a href=\"http://politicstalk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee82bae\">The Liberal Democrats - irrelevance or breath of fresh air?</a><br></p> <p><b>Who are my candidates?</b><br> <a href=\"http://politics-dev.guardianunlimited.co.uk/aristotle/\">Ask Aristotle</a></p> <p><b>Polls</b><br> <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/election2001/story/0,9029,446771,00.html\">Latest polls</a></p> <p><b>Party campaigns</b><br> <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/election2001/archive/0,9359,462124,00.html\">Labour campaign</a><br> <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/election2001/archive/0,9359,447329,00.html\">Conservative campaign</a><br> <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/election2001/archive/0,9359,462125,00.html\">Liberal Democrat campaign</a><br> <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/otherparties/0,9054,443183,00.html\">Other parties' campaigns</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.conservative-party.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Conservative party</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.labour.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Labour party</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.libdems.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Liberal Democrats</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.plaid-cymru.wales.com/\" target=\"_new\">Plaid Cymru</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.snp.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Scottish National party</a><br> <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/westminster/page/0,9132,442756,00.html\"> More political links</a></p>",

Under-secretary of state for political affairs, Marc Grossman, and deputy assistant for national security affairs, Stephen Hadley, briefed Nato delegates this morning. This follows yesterday's meeting between US deputy secretary of defence, Richard Armitage, and senior Japanese officials. Nato's secretary general, Lord Robertson, welcomed US efforts to forge a dialogue with its allies on Bush's missile defence plan, dubbed \"Son of Star Wars\". He said in a statement: \"This is just the beginning of a thorough process and I particularly appreciate the commitment to consultation in the North Atlantic Council before any decisions have been made.\" Following Mr Armitage's Japanese trip, he will spend Wednesday and Thursday meeting South Korean officials, before moving on to India on Friday. The US deputy defence secretary, Paul Wolfowitz, is expected to visit Moscow later this week to discuss Mr Bush's plans to implement a nationwide security system designed to shoot down missiles attacking US territory. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has given Mr Bush's plans a cautious welcome but is said to disagree with the American president's desire to tear apart the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with Russia. Russia says the treaty is a foundation of world security and should be preserved Interactive guide Son of Star Wars: missile defence Related articles 08.05.2001: Bush resumes spy flights off China 08.05.2001: Radical plan to send US arms bill soaring Useful link Ballistic missile defence organisation",

      "body": "<p>Ronnie O'Sullivan realised a dream last night to take the Embassy World Championship here at the Crucible.</p> <p>Leading 14-7, he was closing in on the record \u00a3250,000 first prize but faltered in the latter part of the afternoon session against John Higgins and the 1998 champion restricted his advantage to 14-10 going into their final session. </p> <p>O'Sullivan began the afternoon as he had concluded the previous evening, when the last four frames had yielded breaks of 99, 100 and 99 to him against one of 107 for Higgins. </p> <p>From his overnight 10-6 he won four of the day's first five frames with runs of 81, 139, 85 and 86 with Higgins securing the other with 65. </p> <p>At one stage, as O'Sullivan accumulated 362 unanswered points, it seemed as if the evening session might be brief but, as Terry Griffiths, the 1979 champion, once remarked: \"The worst time is when you've almost won; when you're a long way in front and you need only a couple of frames to know that, realistically, you can't be caught.\" </p> <p>Matthew Stevens was at such a juncture in last year's final when he led 13-7, only to have his lead reduced to 13-11 after three sessions on his way to an 18-16 defeat by Mark Williams. </p> <p>Initially Higgins did not seem to be playing well enough for a similar recovery to be contemplated but he struggled through the scrappiest frame of the match as O'Sullivan's form abruptly declined, clinched another with a break of 65 and, with confidence and hope restored, added the last of the afternoon with 98. </p> <p>With 20 titles to show from his 28 finals, O'Sullivan rarely shows any inhibitions in clinching winning positions but Crucible finals, particularly for players who have never won, are in a class of their own and Jimmy White fans remember how their man had led Stephen Hendry 14-8 in the 1992 final only to lose 18-14. </p> <p>O'Sullivan was left with a couple of hours to refocus and prepare for the most important session of his career, facing just the possibility that his heart's desire - that of any contender - could be snatched away at the last. </p> <p>It had always seemed his destiny to be world champion but, having reached the age of 25 without making it happen, the pressure was upon him to fulfil the immense expectations engendered by a youthful talent so prodigious that, as with other geniuses, it removed him at an early age from normality. </p> <p>From the time he won his first pro-am at the age of 12 he was living essentially like an adult, playing here, there and everywhere.

      "bodyText": "Ronnie O'Sullivan realised a dream last night to take the Embassy World Championship here at the Crucible. Leading 14-7, he was closing in on the record \u00a3250,000 first prize but faltered in the latter part of the afternoon session against John Higgins and the 1998 champion restricted his advantage to 14-10 going into their final session. O'Sullivan began the afternoon as he had concluded the previous evening, when the last four frames had yielded breaks of 99, 100 and 99 to him against one of 107 for Higgins. From his overnight 10-6 he won four of the day's first five frames with runs of 81, 139, 85 and 86 with Higgins securing the other with 65. At one stage, as O'Sullivan accumulated 362 unanswered points, it seemed as if the evening session might be brief but, as Terry Griffiths, the 1979 champion, once remarked: \"The worst time is when you've almost won; when you're a long way in front and you need only a couple of frames to know that, realistically, you can't be caught.\" Matthew Stevens was at such a juncture in last year's final when he led 13-7, only to have his lead reduced to 13-11 after three sessions on his way to an 18-16 defeat by Mark Williams. Initially Higgins did not seem to be playing well enough for a similar recovery to be contemplated but he struggled through the scrappiest frame of the match as O'Sullivan's form abruptly declined, clinched another with a break of 65 and, with confidence and hope restored, added the last of the afternoon with 98. With 20 titles to show from his 28 finals, O'Sullivan rarely shows any inhibitions in clinching winning positions but Crucible finals, particularly for players who have never won, are in a class of their own and Jimmy White fans remember how their man had led Stephen Hendry 14-8 in the 1992 final only to lose 18-14. O'Sullivan was left with a couple of hours to refocus and prepare for the most important session of his career, facing just the possibility that his heart's desire - that of any contender - could be snatched away at the last. It had always seemed his destiny to be world champion but, having reached the age of 25 without making it happen, the pressure was upon him to fulfil the immense expectations engendered by a youthful talent so prodigious that, as with other geniuses, it removed him at an early age from normality. From the time he won his first pro-am at the age of 12 he was living essentially like an adult, playing here, there and everywhere. He could not evade the claims of real life, however, once his carefree youth ended at the age of 16. While he was in the process of winning 72 of his first 74 professional matches in qualifying competitions during a long summer at Blackpool, his father was on trial at the Old Bailey. Ronnie Senior has been serving a life sentence ever since. Some of the remedies to which the young O'Sullivan turned to ease the black depressions which began to descend simply created more problems. He had to forfeit the 1998 Irish Masters title and the \u00a361,000 prize-money through testing positive for marijuana; and he lost his driving licence for speeding. For three years he has been supporting the daughter of a former girlfriend. And in 1996 his pent-up emotions caused him to snap so uncharacteristically that he assaulted a press officer here. \"There are a lot of things I would like to change and do differently,\" said O'Sullivan, who has also undergone extensive psychotherapy. \"But I've just got to accept it and just get on with it.\"",

He and Anthony McGrath powered their way to a stand of 114 to take the game away from Durham and, more importantly, whack up Yorkshire's run rate. The strain was such that Lehmann pulled a hamstring and had to sit out Durham's reply with a cigarette. Theirs was inevitably going to be a lower-key effort than Yorkshire's. They knew from the start that they had to make only 195 to qualify on run rate, whatever happened elsewhere. When Jimmy Daley pulled a hamstring too and retired hurt on 14 and they lost Michael Gough, who had just made his first one-day 50, in a flurry of middle-order wickets, the die was cast. In the late afternoon Danny Law and Jon Lewis took Durham past the magic figures with four overs to spare. It was as sweet a contrived finish as possible.",

      "bodyText": "The Spanish internet service provider, Terra Lycos, is slashing its workforce by 15% in a bid to stem losses. The world's third largest ISP will cut over 500 employees from its 3,352-strong workforce after a slowdown in web advertising revenue. Terra made the announcement alongside narrower-than-expected first quarter losses of \u00a347m, which pushed its shares up by 6% on the Madrid stock exchange. Although analysts praised the loss, which came before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (LBITDA), they pointed out that gross profits had fallen by 10%. \"The LBITDA losses are the key figure, and they are good, but the gross profits are disappointing,\" said Bob Kommers, analyst at ABN Amro. \"At first the results look quite good, but if you dig deeper they are not very strong, so it's mixed feelings.\" Analysts also expect Terra Lycos to abandon its wildly optimistic prediction that it would earn \u00a3630m this year. They expect \u00a3475m to be a more realistic figure. The company was formed when Spanish internet firm Terra Networks bought its US rival, Lycos, for \u00a33.2bn last year, creating an ISP with a presence in 42 countries. But the Spanish outfit, which has 7m subscribers, has a long way to go before it can break into the top two of America Online or Microsoft, and will have to make acquisitions. It remains to be seen if the company's controlling shareholder, the Telefonica phone group, will sanction a spending spree in the current market conditions. Furthermore, the Terra Lycos management board is hardly in a position to bed down new acquisitions, following the resignation of three senior executives over the past 12 months.

      "bodyText": "Emap's beleaguered chief executive, Kevin Hand, has confirmed that the company already has well-developed plans to turn its successful celebrity magazine Heat into a TV show. Speaking at the Periodical Publishers Association's annual conference, Mr Hand said that Heat \"would be a mass-market TV service within the next 12 months\". Heat, which boosted its circulation by nearly 140% at the last ABCs, is considered as one of Emap's greatest success stories and ripe for exploitation as a TV format. But celebrity TV - although compelling to both viewers and advertisers in theory - has proved difficult to pull off. Last year ITV showed a masthead version of celebrity magazine OK!, fronted by GMTV's Fiona Phillips. However, a second series was never commissioned after a dispute between ITV chiefs and OK!'s publisher, Richard Desmond. Emap executives have been poring over the strategy for some time and believe they have the in-house knowledge to make a success of Heat TV. Earlier in the year, Emap appointed the former Empire publishing director, Steve Buckley, to focus on developing masthead TV brand spin-offs for some of Emap Elan's most successful magazines. And Emap Elan has been working with the independent Picture Production Company on plans. The move mirrors a similar strategy at Emap Performance, where magazines including Q, Kerrang! and Smash Hits have already been turned into 24-hour live TV channels.

At the peak of the attack, one shell was fired every 30 seconds. There was no immediate word on civilian casualties, or indication that the rebels were returning fire. But an NLA leader, who only goes by the name Commander Hoxha, said that the rebels had not withdrawn, as the Macedonian authorities have claimed. He renewed the rebels' call for talks with the government which, he said, was \"in deep crisis\" because of widespread support for the NLA. The government refuses to negotiate directly with the rebels, but has said that it is prepared to hold talks over constitutional reform with members of ethnic Albanian political parties. Macedonia's prime minister, Ljubco Georgievski, has invited the two main opposition parties - one of them ethnic Albanian - to form a coalition government for national unity. Their inclusion marks an attempt to end the fighting between the government troops and the rebels, who say they are fighting for greater rights and recognition for the country's minority ethnic Albanians. The UN estimates that 6,000 ethnic Albanians have fled from Macedonia to Kosovo since February.

In what was clearly a dig at his rivals - particularly Emap, IPC, BBC Worldwide and H Bauer - Mr Mansfield said most recent launches in this sector were \"aimed at the advertising sales communities, which are driven by demographics\". Instead, he said, publishers should be thinking more about the needs of readers in this \"uncomfortable demographic\". His remarks come just weeks after IPC folded its long-running woman's weekly, Woman's Realm, and announced its plans for a title called Your Life. IPC's move reflects its belief women over the age of 40 no longer want to be treated as part of a different generation. But Mr Mansfield said there was a danger that publishers were targeting a \"demographic condition\" rather than real readers. In a wide-ranging speech on the future of the magazine industry, Mr Mansfield said publishers needed to remember a slight downturn in advertising was \"inevitable\". Brand extension and diversification into new areas of business would be \"paramount\", he added.",

      "body": "<p>It is William Hague's job to remain 100% loyal to the idea that the Conservatives can pull off a shock election victory.</p> <p>But even within the Conservative central office \"war room\" they know in their hearts that the only worthwhile speculation is over the scale of their coming defeat.</p> <p>Some are even prepared to gamble that it will prove so crushing that Mr Hague finds himself the shortest lived Tory party leader since Harold Wilson sent Sir Alec Douglas-Home back to spend more time on his beloved grouse moors in 1964.</p> <p>Mr Hague may dream of a repeat of the Tories surprise 1970 general election victory when virtually all the opinion polls had also agreed that, as now, a relatively successful Labour government would be returned to office with a comfortable majority.</p> <p>In May 1970 Mr Wilson called an election for that June on the basis of opinion polls which gave him a 7-point poll lead over the Conservatives. Six weeks later Ted Heath pulled off a famous victory by turning that 7-point deficit in the polls into a 3-point lead in the popular vote to give him a Commons majority of 30.</p> <p>What chance is there a repeat of that shock scenario?</p> <p>Mr Wilson's government may have been successful but it was deeply unpopular compared with New Labour. He lost his opinion poll lead within a year of the 1966 election and his claim that Labour was now the \"natural party of government\" was repeatedly battered by byelection losses and Gallup polls showing the Tories lead averaging 16 points throughout 1968 and 1969.</p> <p>So what does the long term four year trend in the polls tell us about what is likely to happen in this general election? First it is well to remember what the historic 1997 landslide result actually was.</p> <p>Labour won by a margin of 13 points with 44% of the vote compared with the Tories 31%. The Liberal Democrats took 17% of the vote.</p> <p>Some 31m people voted on a turnout of 71% of the registered electors. It was enough to give Tony Blair the 179-seat majority he needed to form the first Labour government in Britain for 18 years.</p> <p>Since then Labour has registered unprecedented opinion poll leads for a governing party. The Guardian/ICM poll recorded an average Labour lead of 19 points in 1998; of 18 points in 1999; and an average of 9 points last year.</p> <p>The only blip has proved to be last September when the briefly lived popular revolt over petrol briefly puts the Tories ahead by a nose.</p> <p>The last four years have seen the Conservative party floundering in the immediate aftermath of the Blair victory, hitting rock bottom at 23% in October 1997 before recovering a measure of dignity in early 1998 when it clawed its way back to about 30% in the polls. Here it stayed for most of 1998 and 1999 during two years of \"flatlining\".</p> <p>Last summer saw a modest advance for Mr Hague as Tony Blair admitted in a leaked memo that the government was widely perceived to be \"somehow out of touch with gut British instincts\" on key issues such as crime and asylum seekers.</p> <p>The Tory share of the vote went up to the 34/35% level on the Guardian/ICM poll where it has remained ever since.</p> <p>If the Liberal Democrats share of the vote stays at the 16/17 point level it has remained for nearly the whole of the last parliament, it can be expected that a nine point lead for Labour could still translate into a 140 seat plus majority for Tony Blair.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Mr Hague must hope that he can squeeze the current 15 point Labour lead during the campaign and if he is to survive as Conservative party leader then he must cut Labour's majority to less than below 100 seats.</p> <p>In crude terms that goal will mean cutting Labour's lead to below 5 points. A rough guide is that for every point over 5% he cuts Labour's lead the Tories gain about 10 seats.</p> <p>Once Labour's lead drops below five points many more seats become marginal and the Tories can gain 20-30 seats for every extra one point share of the popular vote.</p> <p>In part whether Mr Hague survives will depend on the turnout. Recent polling evidence has supported the academic argument that the greater reluctance of core Labour voters to get to the polling booths is strongest in its heartland seats where it already has piled up big majorities.</p> <p>As an ICM/News of the World poll recently showed, Labour's vote in 139 key marginal seats has actually gone up by 3.9% since May 1997 and in the same seats the Tories have only made a gain of 0.9%.</p> <p>The implication is clearly that Mr Blair could win big again on June 7 with a majority of more than 100 even if the turnout falls to its lowest level for 50 years.

      "bodyText": "It is William Hague's job to remain 100% loyal to the idea that the Conservatives can pull off a shock election victory. But even within the Conservative central office \"war room\" they know in their hearts that the only worthwhile speculation is over the scale of their coming defeat. Some are even prepared to gamble that it will prove so crushing that Mr Hague finds himself the shortest lived Tory party leader since Harold Wilson sent Sir Alec Douglas-Home back to spend more time on his beloved grouse moors in 1964. Mr Hague may dream of a repeat of the Tories surprise 1970 general election victory when virtually all the opinion polls had also agreed that, as now, a relatively successful Labour government would be returned to office with a comfortable majority. In May 1970 Mr Wilson called an election for that June on the basis of opinion polls which gave him a 7-point poll lead over the Conservatives. Six weeks later Ted Heath pulled off a famous victory by turning that 7-point deficit in the polls into a 3-point lead in the popular vote to give him a Commons majority of 30. What chance is there a repeat of that shock scenario? Mr Wilson's government may have been successful but it was deeply unpopular compared with New Labour. He lost his opinion poll lead within a year of the 1966 election and his claim that Labour was now the \"natural party of government\" was repeatedly battered by byelection losses and Gallup polls showing the Tories lead averaging 16 points throughout 1968 and 1969. So what does the long term four year trend in the polls tell us about what is likely to happen in this general election? First it is well to remember what the historic 1997 landslide result actually was. Labour won by a margin of 13 points with 44% of the vote compared with the Tories 31%. The Liberal Democrats took 17% of the vote. Some 31m people voted on a turnout of 71% of the registered electors. It was enough to give Tony Blair the 179-seat majority he needed to form the first Labour government in Britain for 18 years. Since then Labour has registered unprecedented opinion poll leads for a governing party. The Guardian/ICM poll recorded an average Labour lead of 19 points in 1998; of 18 points in 1999; and an average of 9 points last year. The only blip has proved to be last September when the briefly lived popular revolt over petrol briefly puts the Tories ahead by a nose. The last four years have seen the Conservative party floundering in the immediate aftermath of the Blair victory, hitting rock bottom at 23% in October 1997 before recovering a measure of dignity in early 1998 when it clawed its way back to about 30% in the polls. Here it stayed for most of 1998 and 1999 during two years of \"flatlining\". Last summer saw a modest advance for Mr Hague as Tony Blair admitted in a leaked memo that the government was widely perceived to be \"somehow out of touch with gut British instincts\" on key issues such as crime and asylum seekers. The Tory share of the vote went up to the 34/35% level on the Guardian/ICM poll where it has remained ever since. If the Liberal Democrats share of the vote stays at the 16/17 point level it has remained for nearly the whole of the last parliament, it can be expected that a nine point lead for Labour could still translate into a 140 seat plus majority for Tony Blair. Meanwhile, Mr Hague must hope that he can squeeze the current 15 point Labour lead during the campaign and if he is to survive as Conservative party leader then he must cut Labour's majority to less than below 100 seats. In crude terms that goal will mean cutting Labour's lead to below 5 points. A rough guide is that for every point over 5% he cuts Labour's lead the Tories gain about 10 seats. Once Labour's lead drops below five points many more seats become marginal and the Tories can gain 20-30 seats for every extra one point share of the popular vote. In part whether Mr Hague survives will depend on the turnout. Recent polling evidence has supported the academic argument that the greater reluctance of core Labour voters to get to the polling booths is strongest in its heartland seats where it already has piled up big majorities. As an ICM/News of the World poll recently showed, Labour's vote in 139 key marginal seats has actually gone up by 3.9% since May 1997 and in the same seats the Tories have only made a gain of 0.9%. The implication is clearly that Mr Blair could win big again on June 7 with a majority of more than 100 even if the turnout falls to its lowest level for 50 years. In fact it is possible that the bigger the turnout, the bigger the Labour majority. The scale of tactical voting in individual seats is expected to be less developed than in 1997 but for many voters it seems the prospect of a Hague government is even less of an attraction than John Major's proved to be in 1997. Perhaps for Mr Hague the most apt comparison is not 1970 but Mrs Thatcher's 1987 general election victory. Then the governing party was re-elected on 42% of the vote with the main opposition party taking 31%. Mrs Thatcher's majority was cut to 101, a net loss of 21 seats. Add around 40 to reflect Tony Blair's higher first term majority and the figures don't look too far out of line with what the polls have been telling us for the past four years. The Labour party gave Neil Kinnock the benefit of the doubt in the aftermath of their 1987 general election defeat - it would not be too surprising if the Conservatives were to do the same with William Hague.

      "bodyText": "The foreign secretary, Robin Cook, will today take over responsibility for implementing a potentially controversial pledge to redefine the powers of Westminster and other European national parliaments. Mr Cook is to be chosen as president of a social democrats' umbrella group, the Party of European Socialists, at a congress in Berlin. In a declaration of agreed principles, of which the final draft was circulating last night, member parties call for a \"new definition of the role of national parliaments in the building of Europe while strengthening the European parliament\". Mr Cook said he had no difficulty with the wording, arguing that it was consistent with Tony Blair's proposal last November of a second chamber for the European parliament to made up of members chosen in national legislatures. \"I welcome the fact that the party of European socialists (PES) also recognises that we should find a place for the national parliaments in the architecture of Europe,\" he added. But in a febrile pre-campaign atmosphere, the passage was likely to be seized on by Labour's opponents as evidence that the party is ready to compromise on the sovereignty of Westminster. The Tories argued last night that comment yesterday by the German chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der's that the British government should \"work in Europe for Europe\" were highly significant. The shadow foreign secretary, Francis Maude, claimed they meant that \"for the first time a senior European politician has stated what Labour dare not admit: that Tony Blair wants to take Britain into an EU superstate. \"Shortly, Tony Blair will fire the starting gun on the general election, to be held on June 7.

The question of the EU's fu ture was given added urgency last week when the German chancellor launched an unapologetically federalist plan which also envisaged a second chamber, but one formed by the council of ministers. The effect would be to turn ministers and heads of government into Euro-senators and the chancellor's plan has met with deep misgivings in London and several other EU capitals. After it was presented, Mr Blair's aides first confirmed, then announced the cancellation of his attendance at the left's summit in Berlin. The Schr\u00f6der blueprint was yesterday unanimously adopted by the party board of his ruling Social Democratic party, and the chancellor used the congress to press German claims to leadership in Europe. Welcoming delegates, he declared that European integration was essential to the identity of today's Germany. Mr Schr\u00f6der added: \"German Social Democrats will take upon themselves the role of being the party of European integration\". But his, and their, problem are that few other countries are generating the same degree of enthusiasm for a quasi-federal Europe, and deep divisions remain, even among political allies, on questions of fundamental principle.",

Asked if he had a \"big idea\", he said: \"We are going to be tough on crime. We have had a Labour government that has been pathetically weak on crime.\" Mr Hague said Labour had \"squandered a huge Commons majority, the goodwill of the people of this country, and the best set of economic conditions any government has ever inherited. Never has a party had so much, but achieved so little.\" Video Watch Tony Blair's election announcement (from the BBC) Full text Tony Blair's election speech Related articles 08.05.2001: It's painful to be a Tory 08.05.2001: Soundbite truths 08.05.2001: Tory 'meltdown' on cards, claim Lib Dems 08.05.2001: Women lose ground 06.05.2001, Andrew Rawnsley: Ready to go to the people Talk about it Is another big Labour victory good for democracy?

      "bodyText": "Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble today warned he will resign as first minister of the Northern Ireland executive unless the IRA begins to hand over its illegal arsenal. Mr Trimble confirmed that he had handed a post-dated letter of resignation to assembly speaker Lord Alderdice threatening to resign on July 1 if substantial disarmament does not take place. The international body overseeing decommissioning has set a deadline of June 30 for the complete handing in of paramilitary weapons. But Mr Trimble has hit out, insisting that there were now less than eight weeks for the Provisionals to meet promises made at Hillsborough in May 2000. He said: \"Because there is so little time left, because some in the Republican movement think they can avoid their obligations, and because there have been comments, purporting to come from government, casting doubt on that date, I have decided to reinforce the agreement made at Hillsborough. \"Mr Speaker, I have this day signed and lodged with you a letter resigning as first minister as from 1 July 2001. This letter will take effect unless before that date, the republican movement keeps the promise it made over a year ago.\" The assembly was previously suspended in February 2000 by the former Northern Ireland Secretary, Peter Mandelson, to prevent the institutions collapsing. Mr Trimble had left a notice of intention with his party chairman threatening to resign in the absence of IRA decommissioning. The assembly was restored in May 2000 after the IRA made a series of pledges to begin the process of disarmament. But a Stormont insider said today's letter provided a much greater threat to the Good Friday agreement. \"This was given to the speaker which makes it much less in dispute. It is a very definite step he has taken and it will be much harder for him to draw back from,\" he said. A spokesman for the Prime Minister said that it would be \"highly regrettable\" if Mr Trimble were to resign his post for any reason. He said that the government had made it clear in May of last year that it hoped and expected progress on all these issues to be made by June of this year. The Northern Ireland Secretary, John Reid, also said that Mr Trimble's resignation would be \"highly regrettable\". He said the government had already made it clear that for the Good Friday agreement to succeed, everyone needed to meet their commitments.

      "bodyText": "The Sun today refused to say how much cash it parted with to bring train robber Ronnie Biggs back home. The figure, reported to be upwards of \u00a3350,000, could total even more if the expense of bringing Biggs back to the UK is taken into account. Chauffair, one of Britain's leading private jet hire firms, estimated it would have cost \"in the region of \u00a3130,000\" to fly Biggs back from Rio in the Dassault Falcon 500, with stop-offs in Africa on both legs of the journey for refuelling. And seasoned journalists on rival papers believe the Sun has paid a \"considerable\" amount to secure the return of Biggs to face UK justice. Kevin Crace, reported to be \"a Biggs family friend\", is rumoured to have been paid generously to help set up the 71-year-old robber's return. Fleet Street is awash with rumours about the size of the bounty Mr Bigg's son Michael landed for his part in bringing his father to justice. According to reports over the weekend, he received \u00a320,000. However, today the talk is of a sum closer to \u00a3120,000. \"The money spoken of is on the conservative side. Why would Ronnie Biggs come home for \u00a320,000? This has got to be his pension and legacy for his family,\" said one journalist. It is believed the News of the World tried to \"buy up\" fellow great train robber Bruce Reynolds and his son Nick, who travelled with the Sun to Rio. Sources say Reynolds is being paid \u00a312,000 in expenses by the Sun. Other expenses include jetting out four squads of Sun journalists to Rio over the past month and the cost of putting up them, Biggs and his entourage in the hotel. A spokeswoman refused to comment on the cost of the deal. \"We don't want to say anything about this at the moment,\" she said. The newspaper also said it would be co-operating fully with any investigation by the Press Complaints Commission, hinting strongly that it would be using the \"public interest\" argument in its defence. \"The requirements of the PCC code were fully taken into account,\" the spokeswoman said. \"We are happy to co-operate and will be making clear the massive public interest in returning a convicted criminal home to face justice at no cost to the taxpayer.\" The Sun sent six journalists and two photographers to Rio, but other UK newspapers took a more low-key approach. The Mail sent Paul Henderson to the Rio media scrum but the Express's Harold Emert is based in Brazil and the Daily Telegraph used Rio stringer Andrew Downie. The Mirror didn't bother sending anyone and today played down the story by placing it on page five. According to one journalist on a rival paper, this was partly for reasons of cost and partly because of scepticism that the Sun would be able to pull off the move. The last minute doubt over whether Biggs would get on a plane, combined with the general cutbacks on newspapers, conspired against an exotic trip out for Fleet Street's crime correspondents. \"People are cutting back on budgets in Fleet Street and they were sceptical as to whether he [Mr Biggs] would actually come back. \"Also, with Biggs tucked away with [Sun reporter] John Askill, the press were wondering if there would be a scene to report on,\" said one journalist.

      "body": "<p>Charles Cohen is sitting in a cafe on a grey, drizzly, Monday morning pondering what might have been. Eighteen months ago Cohen, then just 30, was featured in the Guardian's e50, a collection of young internet entrepreneurs with big ambitions. He went on to build his company, <a href=\"http://www.beenz.com\">Beenz.com</a>, into a business worth \u00a3200m and employing 300 people with backing from the likes of Oracle founder Larry Ellison. </p> <p>Then, almost overnight, things started to go wrong. By the end of this month, Beenz.com will employ less than 50 staff who, along with Cohen, now face a very uncertain future. His story, Cohen notes, is that of an ordinary new economy company. \"We are down to the bone. The question now is whether it is in the interest of the shareholders to continue the business,\" he says. </p> <p>The conversation slips somehow to Yo Sushi, the chain of Japanese eateries. They are his favourite place to eat but he can't afford to go more than once a week. \"You pile up these little plates and before you know it you've spent 20 quid,\" he says, exasperated. Poor, it seems, is the new rich for the e-generation, once feted for their paper fortunes. </p> <p>The e50, published in October 1999, suggested the world, or at least Britain, was undergoing a dramatic change. Unfettered by the usual national traits, here was a collection of brash, often arrogant, twenty- or thirtysomethings aiming to rewrite the business rules and make themselves rich in the process. </p> <p>Money was flowing and they had the sense of being the embodiment of the zeitgeist on the eve of a new century. \"Living through the 90s and not getting involved in an internet start-up is like living though the 60s and not smoking,\" Serena Doshi at <a href=\"http://www.liv4now.com\">Liv4Now</a> had memorably said. </p> <p>They were a cultural phenomenon rapidly developing their own cliches: the uniform of combat pants and T-shirt and working in \"spaces\" rather than offices. Table football and inflatable aliens were de rigueur. It wasn't long before their language bled into the mainstream. Then, just as suddenly as the new rules had emerged, they changed. </p> <p>The new paradigm was based on a sharp reduction in the cost of transactions. No high-street branches and no brokers meant prices should fall dramatically. Younger minds got it, while it seemed older ones didn't. As it turned out they didn't account for the apathy of the general public whose interest in them was purely prurient. E-commerce and online advertising grew at nothing like the rates people had hoped. As it turned out as well, the older brains got it perfectly well. And big business responded more fiercely than they had anticipated. </p> <p>Stock markets plummeted, the cash swilling around from financiers suddenly dried up. The call for growth at all costs was silenced and many businesses failed. Egos were punctured. The e-entrepeneurs's contribution to the language is no less visible, only now it consists of phrases such as \"cash burn\" (the rate at which funds are eaten up) or the \"90% club\" (an increasingly non-exclusive organisation made up of people who have seen the value of their investments fall tenfold). B2C, once the breathless shorthand for \"business to consumer\", became \"back to consulting\" and B2B, short for the briefly white-hot sector of \"business to business\", became \"back to banking\". </p> <p>The phrase \"no God-given right to make money\" crops up a lot when you talk to members of our e50 now. For those whose big idea got no further than the back of a beer mat there is a large slice of schadenfreude in watching the likes of Cohen et al brought back to earth. </p> <p>The fates of members of our e50 in the intervening year and a half have differed widely.

Few managed to make the big time financially. </p> <p>Others saw their personal worth scale extraordinary heights, only to watch it come tumbling back down. Many of the businesses launching 18 months ago are now up for sale. The feverish excitement that caused highly-paid City workers to swap their jobs for the promise of vast wealth through share options seems a distant memory. </p> <p>Back in the heady days of 1999, dot.coms didn't interview potential new staff - it was the interviewees who did the interviewing. The opportunities were so plentiful that any number of firms would offer them the chance to make their fortunes. \"It bred a tremendous amount of arrogance,\" says Nick Denton of <a href=\"http://www.moreover.com\">Moreover.com</a>. \"They were demanding to know why they should work for your company and asking you to justify it for them.\" </p> <p>Denton, based in Silicon Valley, recently placed a small ad in the local paper looking for a general assistant on a salary of $20 an hour. \"I got more than 200 responses including one from a guy who was president and founder of his own internet company. He said he had 'cash-flow issues'.\" </p> <p>Asked to recall the beginnings of Beenz.com, a hint of the excitement of 18 months earlier returns to Cohen's eye. Beenz.com was a loyalty programme awarding internet users points across all member websites. The idea had come about because of the amount of plastic in Cohen's wallet. Each card awarded its own loyalty points that individually amounted to nothing. \"It spread very quickly and excited a lot of people. It was a grand idea with a capital G,\" he says. Beenz.com raised its funding and Cohen, a former speech writer for the LibDems, began to appear on rich lists. </p> <p>Beenz.com's clients however were other dot.coms. As investors began to get nervous so the company's pool of potential clients began to vanish. \"Our market just dissolved. It disappeared. We would sign contracts with a company on a Friday and call them on a Monday only to find they had gone into liquidation. We were left with bad debts from bankrupt companies, smaller marketing budgets and lengthened sales cycles. Just about everything that could go wrong. I would say 80% of our market disappeared within six months. </p> <p>\"You get a heavy dose of humility. There was a lot of naivety out there. I'm not saying this applied to us, but people thought they could defy gravity and that just because an idea looked good on paper it would be great in practice. There was a lot of false wisdom around, particularly from analysts and investment banks. People genuinely believed in the millions of dollars they would get from stock options. They bought the hype and when it became clear that wouldn't happen there was a sense of resentment and disillusionment.\" </p> <p>A favourite phrase of the time was \"internet speed\" to express the rapid pace with which a business could go from concept to sizeable operation. It could as easily refer to how quickly things turned sour. </p> <p>There was no shortage of eye-catching implosions. Rob Norton, then 27 and Toby Rowland, 30, son of the late industrialist Tiny Rowland, bragged that they had raised \u00a33m in the City just eight days after approaching their first investor. Their website, a natural health business called <a href=\"http://www.clickmango.com\">ClickMango</a> had yet to launch but had already been valued at \u00a38m. The two young founders were worth a notional \u00a32.5m each. Notional though turned out to be just that. The company folded in July. \"We witnessed an exceptional moment in history,\" Norton says. </p> <p>Rob Hersov, a 40-year-old South African, became one of the best known members of the species after attracting more than \u00a350m investment for his network of sports websites, Sportal. He embodied the ideal of thinking big. Now even he is struggling to raise cash and may go under. </p> <p>Hersov had been at the centre of the dot.com scene, but like most others rarely bothers going to organised events anymore. The camaraderie that accompanied the rash of start-ups seems to have dissipated. Daniel Gestetner who is in the process of selling his shopping portal <a href=\"http://www.shopsmart.com\">Shop Smart</a> after failing to float the business says: \"There certainly isn't the excitement there once was. There was a real buzz. A sense that we were all part of something great, riding the crest of a wave. Now there is a lot of pessimism about. There isn't that same pride of belonging to something. People are instead wondering if their businesses will survive and where they will be in the next three or six months. That's all good experience but it isn't exciting.\" </p> <p>Probably the best symbol of the collapse was <a href=\"http://www.firsttuesday.com\">First Tuesday</a>. Set up in a Soho bar by a group of friends in 1999 as a way for entrepreneurs to meet venture capitalists, it spread around the world like a benevolent virus, but ended in acrimony. At its peak it had operations in 110 countries and more than 50,000 members attracting sponsorship. </p> <p>In August last year an Israeli technology firm paid \u00a333m for the group. Most of the money was paid in shares but the four founders each pocketed a few hundred thousand pounds in cash. </p> <p>Six months of tech misery later, the Israeli purchaser had fallen into financial difficulty and First Tuesday was sold back to its members for just \u00a31m. The numbers attending the almost weekly meetings had fallen sharply, venture capitalists had closed their wallets and First Tuesday is now in hibernation. </p> <p>The watershed for many was <a href=\"http://www.boo.com\">Boo.com</a>, the online fashion business which raised \u00a380m but suffered from technical problems and basic lack of retail skills. It spent huge amounts of cash on branding and crashed in spectacular style. \"Boo.com was the big turning point for everyone. Suddenly we were all vulnerable,\" says Cohen. \"No matter how many column inches you had.\" </p> <p>The real test of endurance will come in the next nine-12 months' time. Many companies which managed to raise financing in June or July last year after things had started to go wrong have enough money to see them through for another year or so. Beyond that, it is a matter of hoping the market returns. It seems unlikely. </p> <p>Surprisingly, few lay blame at the feet of the financiers who exhorted the companies to grow at all costs during the \"land grab\", or on the PR advisors who blew them up. Everyone was seduced by the same madness. </p> <p>Carol Dukes at health website <a href=\"http://www.thinknatural.com\">ThinkNatural.com</a> says part of the problem had come from making forecasts when nobody really knew how the internet would take off. Half of ThinkNatural's revenues now come from a mail-order catalogue and Dukes admits online sales have been slower than anticipated. But she adds: \"I think things are now too gloomy. Everyone is talking as though the internet has crumbled and everything involved in it is an irredeemable failure. But it is still the fastest growing medium there has ever been, and more and more people are buying online. I heard someone recently moaning that only 13% of the population had bought online. But I think that to go from zero to 13% in such a short space of time is phenomenal.\" </p> <p>So will the speculative boom have a lasting effect on the \"can do\" culture in this country? Some have been burned. \"Myths were made and unfortunately there have been few survivors of those people who built themselves up in the press. In some cases, among people I know, that has damaged them personally and that's a shame,\" says James Oliver of <a href=\"http://www.lastorders.com\">LastOrders.com</a>. </p> <p>The test will also be whether the financial community is willing to allow a second chance. In the US it is regarded as a positive to have had a business failure behind you. What the e50 do all agree on is that they have had the kind of experiences in 18 months that many labour 18 years for. It is worth remembering that, according to the Federation of Small Businesses, one in every three new companies fail in the first three years. The e50 have just done it in the spotlight. </p> <p>Hersov says: \"A lot of these people running businesses had never done anything before. They felt like heroes, and of course it goes to their heads, it tends to affect the psyche. In a way it's good that people have been through huge ups and downs. They will come out the better for it. The graduates of this boom and bust will become the tough, grizzled entrepreneurs that Europe needs.\" </p> <p>And of course there have been those who genuinely struck gold. Chris Akers sold his two-year-old sports website to BSkyB for \u00a3301m days before the market for dot.com's collapsed, netting him \u00a315m. <a href=\"http://www.jungle.com\">Jungle.com</a>, once tipped for a \u00a3700m flotation was sold last September to Argos owner, Great Universal Stores, for \u00a333m, with Steve Bennett pocketing around \u00a311m. Peter Wilkinson, 46, Aker's partner in Sports Internet and the man who came up with the idea for <a href=\"http://www.freeserve.com\">Freeserve</a> is worth the best part of \u00a3500m, much of it now in cash. </p> <p>Dr Mike Lynch, whose Autonomy intelligent software firm floated on the stock market managed to cash in \u00a350m last year and his stake is still worth \u00a390m. The common link is that they are, on average, older than most of the e50 and have almost without exception already run other businesses. </p> <p>Tellingly, the richest man on the list last time around, Paul Sykes, said he was already getting out of the internet in October 1999. Few would doubt he has held onto the title. </p> <p><strong>Useful link</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/netrich/Story/0,2763,201397,00.html\">Who's who: The original e50 list</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Charles Cohen is sitting in a cafe on a grey, drizzly, Monday morning pondering what might have been. Eighteen months ago Cohen, then just 30, was featured in the Guardian's e50, a collection of young internet entrepreneurs with big ambitions. He went on to build his company, Beenz.com, into a business worth \u00a3200m and employing 300 people with backing from the likes of Oracle founder Larry Ellison. Then, almost overnight, things started to go wrong. By the end of this month, Beenz.com will employ less than 50 staff who, along with Cohen, now face a very uncertain future. His story, Cohen notes, is that of an ordinary new economy company. \"We are down to the bone. The question now is whether it is in the interest of the shareholders to continue the business,\" he says. The conversation slips somehow to Yo Sushi, the chain of Japanese eateries. They are his favourite place to eat but he can't afford to go more than once a week. \"You pile up these little plates and before you know it you've spent 20 quid,\" he says, exasperated. Poor, it seems, is the new rich for the e-generation, once feted for their paper fortunes. The e50, published in October 1999, suggested the world, or at least Britain, was undergoing a dramatic change. Unfettered by the usual national traits, here was a collection of brash, often arrogant, twenty- or thirtysomethings aiming to rewrite the business rules and make themselves rich in the process. Money was flowing and they had the sense of being the embodiment of the zeitgeist on the eve of a new century. \"Living through the 90s and not getting involved in an internet start-up is like living though the 60s and not smoking,\" Serena Doshi at Liv4Now had memorably said. They were a cultural phenomenon rapidly developing their own cliches: the uniform of combat pants and T-shirt and working in \"spaces\" rather than offices. Table football and inflatable aliens were de rigueur. It wasn't long before their language bled into the mainstream. Then, just as suddenly as the new rules had emerged, they changed. The new paradigm was based on a sharp reduction in the cost of transactions. No high-street branches and no brokers meant prices should fall dramatically. Younger minds got it, while it seemed older ones didn't. As it turned out they didn't account for the apathy of the general public whose interest in them was purely prurient. E-commerce and online advertising grew at nothing like the rates people had hoped. As it turned out as well, the older brains got it perfectly well. And big business responded more fiercely than they had anticipated. Stock markets plummeted, the cash swilling around from financiers suddenly dried up. The call for growth at all costs was silenced and many businesses failed. Egos were punctured. The e-entrepeneurs's contribution to the language is no less visible, only now it consists of phrases such as \"cash burn\" (the rate at which funds are eaten up) or the \"90% club\" (an increasingly non-exclusive organisation made up of people who have seen the value of their investments fall tenfold). B2C, once the breathless shorthand for \"business to consumer\", became \"back to consulting\" and B2B, short for the briefly white-hot sector of \"business to business\", became \"back to banking\". The phrase \"no God-given right to make money\" crops up a lot when you talk to members of our e50 now. For those whose big idea got no further than the back of a beer mat there is a large slice of schadenfreude in watching the likes of Cohen et al brought back to earth. The fates of members of our e50 in the intervening year and a half have differed widely. Some crashed and burned in dramatic style.

Despite the high-profile endorsement of the actress, Joanna Lumley, ClickMango closed just four months after its launch. </p> <p>The website's original business plan had forecast breakeven in year four, but as market conditions worsened, investors started to change their criteria. \"People were looking for the next big thing, which at that time was business-to-business websites.\" </p> <p>It was important for Norton that the operation closed while there was still enough money in the bank to pay creditors and staff, and he says that he has not been deterred from attempting another start-up. He is currently doing consultancy work for other dot.coms, and his experiences are to be used by the London Business School. He won't, though, be looking for a full-time job. He and Rowland want time to work on new ideas. </p> <p>\"The past year has been a journey, and one that has prepared us to do other things we wouldn't have been able to do, and also to take responsibility when things don't work out as you hope. How you manage yourself on the way down is as important as how you do it on the way up.\"<br><strong> David Teather</strong> </p> <p><strong>Built to last</strong><br></p> <p> Brent Hoberman's father had told him the idea was \"useless\". His eventual business partner, Martha Lane Fox, needed some serious cajoling to give up her job and join him. </p> <p>Yet five months after our last survey, and at the height of dot.com frenzy, <a href=\"http://www.lastminute.com\">Lastminute.com</a>, a website aimed at compulsive consumers, floated on the London stock market valued at around \u00a3600m. </p> <p>Less than two years old, heavily loss-making and with a turnover of less than the average pub, it managed to create huge excitement among private investors chasing dot.com fortunes. </p> <p>In the process it transformed Hoberman, now 33, and Lane Fox, 28, who had previously held down unspectacular jobs at relatively anonymous media companies, into national celebrities. The photogenic young founders, who mercilessly courted publicity and were notionally worth almost \u00a3100m between them when the company floated, became an obsession for a national press that was bored by suited businessmen and pored over every inch of their personal lives. </p> <p>When the internet bubble burst, one paper even took to charting the fall in Lane Fox's wealth on a daily basis. \"It's been relentless,\" she says. \"The media attention, the technology issues, the decisions, the growth - it's just been a relentless period. At times it's been difficult, but overall it has been an incredible and hugely varied experience which I feel very fortune to have experienced and at a relatively young age.\" </p> <p>Shares in Lastminute have fallen spectacularly since the flotation, and have lost more than 90% of their one-time value. Many private investors feel that they have had their fingers burnt, but Lane Fox has pledged that better times are ahead. </p> <p>\"We've come a very long way and are forecast by analysts to turnover \u00a3150m this calender year. This is a company which has really come to fruition and is going to succeed.\" </p> <p>Following the acquisition of a rival in France, Lastminute is now Europe's biggest internet travel firm and one of the continent's best known dot.com brands. Three million people receive email from the firm every week. </p> <p>Today, Lane Fox still works at least 12 hours a day, seven days a week, and spends much of her time travelling to Lastminute offices which are spread across seven European countries. Last week it was two days in France; this week, Sweden; next week, Germany. </p> <p>She insists that, of course, she buys from the Lastminute website. \"The stewardess are always amused that I'm crammed right at the back of the plane on a Lastminute ticket.\" </p> <p>Previously based on Oxford Street in London, they have now moved to a building overlooking Buckingham Palace. \"The rent's cheaper,\" she explains. \"We've still got the football table and all the offices are open plan, so some things stay the same.\"<br><strong> John Cassy</strong> </p> <p><strong>A sporting chance</strong><br></p> <p> Rob Hersov was a pin up for many budding internet entrepreneurs. The 40-year-old South African set the blueprint for thinking big with <a href=\"http://www.sportal.com\">Sportal</a>, a network of sports websites which attracted investment from the likes of Bernard Arnault's Europ@web and BSkyB. The business raised more than \u00a350m through two fundraisings, established operations thoughout Europe, Asia and Australasia, and employed 300 people. </p> <p>Last year the company pulled off a coup by winning the rights to be the official website for the Euro 2000 football championships, and attracted the attentions of French pay-per-view television group Canal Plus. Hersov was weeks away from selling the business for around \u00a3280m. Then the market imploded and the deal was off. Now Sportal is down to 220 staff, and trying to raise a third round of funding. If it fails, it faces closure. </p> <p>\"No one is immune to what's going on,\" Hersov says. \"Financing dried up, strategic buyers dried up. There is a complete lack of confidence.\" </p> <p>Hersov says the company needs just \u00a35-6m to break even, but is finding it difficult to attract investors. \"If we get it, we're heroes. If we don't ...\" A deadening silence. \"This is an immediate issue, not something we face in six months' time. It's very frustrating. In a lot of cases businesses are closing down just as they approach break even because the venture capital community is in denial.\" </p> <p>Hersov is a good friend of that other South African internet entrepreneur, Lastminute.com's Brent Hoberman. \"It's been interesting seeing who has stuck with it and who has jumped in the past four months or so when there has been the most pressure. Some jump, some stay with you in the bunker.\" </p> <p>Hersov is involved in a number of other start-ups, including Ant Factory, an incubator for start-ups. But the past three years have been a set-back financially. \"My wife has said, 'Why not get a nice corporate job with business class flights?', but I've got the bug.\"<br><strong>David Teather</strong> </p> <p><strong>Part 1 of the e50</strong><br></p> <p>Richard Downs, 34<br> Iglu.com <br><strong> What does it do? </strong> Provides online ski accommodation. <br><strong> How it's gone:</strong> Downs says the business is close to profitability.

      "bodyText": "Not so healthy As a former journalist, Robert Norton is acutely aware of the good copy that his story makes. \"We have been a bit of symbol of the times,\" he admits. \"The speed with which we raised our funding, and then the fact that we were gone relatively quickly ...\" He allows himself a big grin. ClickMango, the natural health website started by Norton, now 29, and his business partner, Toby Rowland, had famously raised \u00a38m just eight days after the pair had begun to look for funding. It was a tale that they were happy to spin at the time, but which came back to haunt them when they started to look for second-round financing. \"This time I knocked on 100 doors over three months and we couldn't get even a penny,\" Norton says. Despite the high-profile endorsement of the actress, Joanna Lumley, ClickMango closed just four months after its launch. The website's original business plan had forecast breakeven in year four, but as market conditions worsened, investors started to change their criteria. \"People were looking for the next big thing, which at that time was business-to-business websites.\" It was important for Norton that the operation closed while there was still enough money in the bank to pay creditors and staff, and he says that he has not been deterred from attempting another start-up. He is currently doing consultancy work for other dot.coms, and his experiences are to be used by the London Business School. He won't, though, be looking for a full-time job. He and Rowland want time to work on new ideas. \"The past year has been a journey, and one that has prepared us to do other things we wouldn't have been able to do, and also to take responsibility when things don't work out as you hope. How you manage yourself on the way down is as important as how you do it on the way up.\" David Teather Built to last Brent Hoberman's father had told him the idea was \"useless\". His eventual business partner, Martha Lane Fox, needed some serious cajoling to give up her job and join him. Yet five months after our last survey, and at the height of dot.com frenzy, Lastminute.com, a website aimed at compulsive consumers, floated on the London stock market valued at around \u00a3600m. Less than two years old, heavily loss-making and with a turnover of less than the average pub, it managed to create huge excitement among private investors chasing dot.com fortunes. In the process it transformed Hoberman, now 33, and Lane Fox, 28, who had previously held down unspectacular jobs at relatively anonymous media companies, into national celebrities. The photogenic young founders, who mercilessly courted publicity and were notionally worth almost \u00a3100m between them when the company floated, became an obsession for a national press that was bored by suited businessmen and pored over every inch of their personal lives. When the internet bubble burst, one paper even took to charting the fall in Lane Fox's wealth on a daily basis. \"It's been relentless,\" she says. \"The media attention, the technology issues, the decisions, the growth - it's just been a relentless period. At times it's been difficult, but overall it has been an incredible and hugely varied experience which I feel very fortune to have experienced and at a relatively young age.\" Shares in Lastminute have fallen spectacularly since the flotation, and have lost more than 90% of their one-time value. Many private investors feel that they have had their fingers burnt, but Lane Fox has pledged that better times are ahead. \"We've come a very long way and are forecast by analysts to turnover \u00a3150m this calender year. This is a company which has really come to fruition and is going to succeed.\" Following the acquisition of a rival in France, Lastminute is now Europe's biggest internet travel firm and one of the continent's best known dot.com brands. Three million people receive email from the firm every week. Today, Lane Fox still works at least 12 hours a day, seven days a week, and spends much of her time travelling to Lastminute offices which are spread across seven European countries. Last week it was two days in France; this week, Sweden; next week, Germany. She insists that, of course, she buys from the Lastminute website. \"The stewardess are always amused that I'm crammed right at the back of the plane on a Lastminute ticket.\" Previously based on Oxford Street in London, they have now moved to a building overlooking Buckingham Palace. \"The rent's cheaper,\" she explains. \"We've still got the football table and all the offices are open plan, so some things stay the same.\" John Cassy A sporting chance Rob Hersov was a pin up for many budding internet entrepreneurs. The 40-year-old South African set the blueprint for thinking big with Sportal, a network of sports websites which attracted investment from the likes of Bernard Arnault's Europ@web and BSkyB. The business raised more than \u00a350m through two fundraisings, established operations thoughout Europe, Asia and Australasia, and employed 300 people. Last year the company pulled off a coup by winning the rights to be the official website for the Euro 2000 football championships, and attracted the attentions of French pay-per-view television group Canal Plus. Hersov was weeks away from selling the business for around \u00a3280m. Then the market imploded and the deal was off. Now Sportal is down to 220 staff, and trying to raise a third round of funding. If it fails, it faces closure. \"No one is immune to what's going on,\" Hersov says. \"Financing dried up, strategic buyers dried up. There is a complete lack of confidence.\" Hersov says the company needs just \u00a35-6m to break even, but is finding it difficult to attract investors. \"If we get it, we're heroes. If we don't ...\" A deadening silence. \"This is an immediate issue, not something we face in six months' time. It's very frustrating. In a lot of cases businesses are closing down just as they approach break even because the venture capital community is in denial.\" Hersov is a good friend of that other South African internet entrepreneur, Lastminute.com's Brent Hoberman. \"It's been interesting seeing who has stuck with it and who has jumped in the past four months or so when there has been the most pressure. Some jump, some stay with you in the bunker.\" Hersov is involved in a number of other start-ups, including Ant Factory, an incubator for start-ups. But the past three years have been a set-back financially. \"My wife has said, 'Why not get a nice corporate job with business class flights?', but I've got the bug.\" David Teather Part 1 of the e50 Richard Downs, 34 Iglu.com What does it do? Provides online ski accommodation. How it's gone: Downs says the business is close to profitability. Some \"natural attrition\" of staff as the business has shifted focus, but has benefited from being a specialist site and not depending on advertising. Valuation: Second-round funding in July 2000 of \u00a32.7m, taking total to \u00a36m. Downs and other management hold less than 40%. At last valuation, his stake is likely to have increased from \u00a32.4m to around \u00a35m. Ernst Malmsten, 30, and Kajsa Leander, 31 Boo.com What does it do? Sportswear retailer. How it's gone: Bust. The online fashion firm was the highest profile dot.com casualty as it burnt around \u00a370m in record time and put 300 people out of jobs. The duo who wanted \"to bring beautiful clothing to the world\" are now writing a book on how it all went wrong. Valuation: Worth around \u00a310m each last time around; today, maximum of \u00a31m between them from previous ventures. Carol Dukes, 38 ThinkNatural.com What does it do? Sells natural health and beauty products. How it's gone: Expanded in the UK and launched in Germany. Growth slower than hoped, but has \"money in the bank for a year at least\". Moved into mail order, revenues now split with online. Superdrug is an investor and own-label products to be launched in store. Valuation: Raised \u00a310m in second round of financing in May 2000, valuing business at \u00a335m. Four directors share \u00a310m stake. Daniel Gestetner, 29 ShopSmart What does it do? Shopping portal that acts as a guide to retail sites. How it's gone: Grew from 12 to 80 people. Three months ago decided to seek a buyer or merger, finally agreeing a deal with Barclays Bank venture IndigoSquare a month ago. Uncertain whether Gestetner will work for the new set-up. Valuation: Talk of a stock-market flotation, valuing the business at \u00a3200-\u00a3300m. Eventually sold for \u00a31m in cash and 10% stake in the combined company. Gestetner and other directors held less than 50% at sale. Simon Murdoch, 39 Episode 1 Partners What does it do? Provides financial backing and advice for internet start-ups. How it's gone: Former boss of Amazon.co.uk, Murdoch set up \u00a370m venture capital fund with investment bank JP Morgan. Invested \u00a317m in nine businesses, but only one so far this year - the marketing services company, The Works. Valuation: Made an estimated \u00a35m from sale of Bookpages to Amazon. Rich enough never to have to work again. David Lethbridge, 37 Confetti.co.uk What does it do? Provides wedding services, from gifts to dresses to honeymoons. How it's gone: Bought the second and third players in the online wedding market in October, as well as gift mail order business, Burley House. Recently launched in Germany. Says there is enough money in the bank to see the company through to profitability, depending upon expansion plans. Up from 20 to 60 staff. Valuation: Valued last year at \u00a320m. Lethbridge had one-third 18 months ago, now \"significantly less\". Michael Ross, 32 Easyshop What does it do? Sells underwear. How it's gone: The online lingerie business has had a tough time but is still trading healthily. Having changed name to figleaves.com, raised \u00a34m and is planning expansion in the US. The former management consultant admits he sometimes covets the security of his old job. Valuation: From around \u00a35m last time to \u00a31m today. Ewan Macleod, 23 Liv4Now.com What does it do? A portal catering for \"youth\" leisure interests such as clubs and bars. How it's gone: The community website raised \u00a3700,000 in November 1999. Employs 10 people and Macleod says it is already close to breaking even, with cash still in the bank. Launched an outsourcing division and manages community sites for the likes of Handbag.com and World Online. Partner Serena Doshi now part-time. Valuation: Still has a significant stake in the business as only one round of funding. Xavier Azalbert, 36 First-e What does it do? Online banking. How it's gone: Has attracted \u00a337.8m investment. In November last year Azalbert left to took over at Xelector, a Dublin-based provider of comparison-shopping technology for the net, which raised \u00a315m to finance a pan-European expansion. Valuation: New company worth \u00a3175m, but Azalbert's stake unknown. Ziad Salem, 27 Future Internet Technologies What does it do? Provides software that stores company databases online. How it's gone: Floated in June last year and raised \u00a33m from the sale of shares in web business Ant Factory. In October acquired AnytimeNow as a brand for Future Internet Technologies. Valuation: Was worth \u00a33m, similar today. Paul Barry-Walsh, 44 Netstore What does it do? Data warehousing via the internet. How it's gone: Floated on the stock market in April 2000, reported a loss of \u00a31.1m and is valued at \u00a327m. Barry-Walsh also sold his computer disaster recovery firm, SafetyNet, last June, pocketing \u00a370m, and used the proceeds to set up a charitable foundation called Fredericks. Invested in 10 companies, hoping the money raised will fund the foundation. Valuation: Around \u00a387.5m last time, now nearer \u00a370m. Dylan Wilk, 27 Gameplay.com What does it do? Sells computer games via direct mail and over the web. How it's gone: Wilk has ridden the dot.com rollercoaster. Gameplay's valuation jumped from \u00a360m to \u00a3130m but has since slumped to \u00a318.2m as it struggles to work out what its long-term future is. Valuation: Still has the \u00a32m cash he got from selling his mail-order computer game business to Gameplay, and drew a \u00a376,000 salary until quitting last week. Shareholding worth \u00a33m last time, now worth just \u00a31m. Steve Bennett, 34 Jungle.com What does it do? Retails computer software, music, videos and games. How it's gone: Once tipped for a \u00a3700m flotation, Jungle was sold last September to Argos owner Great Universal Stores for \u00a333m, with Bennett pocketing around \u00a311m. Still working for Jungle but has other ideas up his sleave. Working on Globalshed.com, a DIY portal, with friend and former Big Breakfast presenter, Johnny Vaughan. Valuation: Steady at around \u00a315m. Mark Bernstein, 40 Gameplay What does it do? Online games portal. How it's gone: A rollercoaster ride. Won the backing of giants BSkyB, BT and Dixons and looked set for a multi-million pound fortune. But losses have forced Gameplay to cut hundreds of jobs and put itself up for sale. Valuation: Down from \u00a37m to \u00a31.5m. Robert Bonnier, 30 Scoot.com What does it do? Online equivalent to Yellow Pages. How it's gone: The Dutch-born entrepreneur looked to have pulled off a coup when the online directory service won the backing of media giant Vivendi Universal last year. Scoot shares soared, valuing the firm at more than \u00a32bn, and Bonnier at \u00a3140m, but have fallen sharply since then and the company is now thought to be looking for a buyer. Valuation: \u00a34m. James Corsellis, 30 Icollector What does it do? Online auction service. How it's gone: Corsellis moved from CEO to become deputy chairman in January 2001. Icollector entered into joint deals with CNN and the FT. In September sold their web consultancy business, CM Interactive, which raised capital to be invested back into the business. Launched joint site with ebay, which brought in 29 million customers. They now represent 100 auction houses and recently had 1,200 people bidding online. Valuation: \"The value of the share price has dropped by about 90% plus, and I don't even bother to look any more.\" Nick Denton, 35 Moreover.com What does it do? Aggregates news sources from 1,500 company websites. How it's gone: Has secured the backing of Reuters, admits times are tougher, but claims Moreover has enough cash to see it through to profitability.

How it's gone: Set up with \u00a310,000 savings six years ago, and briefly valued last year at \u00a3240m.

Collates news headlines from other news websites. How it's gone: Now collates headlines from more than 800 sites, but company growth unknown.

A next generation passport or e-wallet. How it's gone: His Silicon Valley based e-wallet firm has grown steadily but has reportedly been put up for sale for \u00a3300m. Established on the West Coast as one of the leading British entrepreneurs, but unlikely to make the US his long-term home. Valuation: Undisclosed, but like former flatmate Nick Denton (qv), pocketed few hundred thousand pounds from First Tuesday sale. Abby Hardoon, 38 Magic Moments What does it do?

His QXL shareholding soared to \u00a3272m in his absence - and then lost 99% of its value in he crash. He recently resigned his venture capital position, now concentrating on his newspaper column. Valuation: Worth \u00a337m last time round. Now closer to \u00a33m. Danny Kelly, 44 365 Corporation What does it do? Provides online sports, entertainment and lifestyle news.

Los vecinos intentaron impedir el arresto del joven y el polic\u00eda pidi\u00f3 refuerzos. Al final se enfrentaron veinte polic\u00edas con m\u00e1s de cincuenta vecinos. Los graffitis son parte del paisaje urbano. Un paisaje, sin embargo, que no gusta a todos. Sus autores se mantienen en el anonimato y se identifican con una firma o con el nombre de un grupo. Hacer graffitis es ilegal. Es usar un espacio p\u00fablico sin permiso. Tres j\u00f3venes graffiteros nos dan su punto de vista sobre el graffiti. Piden el anonimato y dan su firma: FKI, Eme y Snipe. Claire es una de las personas que observan sus graffitis. Todos viven en Sant Cugat del Vall\u00e9s, un pueblo cerca de Barcelona. El graffiti, \u00bfes arte? \u00bfcomunicaci\u00f3n? \u00bfvandalismo? \u00bfrebeli\u00f3n? FKI (18 a\u00f1os): Es arte y es comunicaci\u00f3n.

      "bodyText": "The Express Newspapers owner, Richard Desmond, is close to selling his troublesome portfolio of top-shelf magazines but will hang on to his X-rated Fantasy Channel station. His Northern &amp; Shell company has found three buyers for the magazines - which include adult titles such as Asian Babes and Forum - and a sale should go through within three months. The news is a public relations coup for the publishing tycoon, who is desperate to shake off his \"porn baron\" reputation. A spokeswoman for Northern &amp; Shell confirmed the imminent sale but declined to name the buyers or reveal a price for the deal. \"Three companies have been shortlisted and are being subjected to due diligence procedures. Northern &amp; Shell is at the stage where it is simply choosing the buyer,\" said the spokeswoman. It is understood Mr Desmond has offered the stable of magazines to several overseas businesses. The magazines are owned by Mr Desmond's Portland Investments and Fantasy Publications companies. However, his money-spinning adult Fantasy Channel will not be included in the sale. The continued presence of the Fantasy Channel in the Northern &amp; Shell group could scupper Mr Desmond's plans to float his publishing empire, which is valued at \u00a3500m. City advisers will think twice about associating themselves with a company that still has links with the porn business. Mr Desmond has also been forced into a sale for financial reasons, with Portland's latest accounts showing the magazines lost \u00a3870,000 in 1999 and Fantasy Publications lost \u00a3815,000 in the same year. Analysts have suggested the titles may fetch up to \u00a320m. Last year's \u00a3125m acquisition of the Daily Express, the Sunday Express and the Daily Star from United Business Media was financed by a \u00a397m loan from Commerzbank, which sparked a cost-cutting spree at Northern &amp; Shell. The publisher of OK! is following the lead of fellow porn tycoon, David Sullivan, who recently gave away his adult titles after complaining the porn publishing business was past its sell-by date.

      "bodyText": "Torn newspaper reports about Jill Dando's death and written references to other women celebrities were found at the flat of the jobless man accused of murdering the TV presenter, the Old Bailey heard today. \"There were two copies - one torn - of the Metro newspaper referring to the death of Jill Dando,\" said Orlando Pownall prosecuting. He listed other items found including \"a hand-written note re-Maggie Cook at the London Programme.\" There was also a note referring to Sue Richardson Features at LWT. Also found were photo cards for Emma Freud and Anthea Turner. Mr Pownall alleged police discovered a list of film and television personalities, with the names of Brit Ekland in one column and Suzanne Dando. In addition there was a list of models with some details of homes addresses, agencies and newspapers. \"You may think it follows the defendant would look at individuals that caught his eye and make a list,\" said Mr Pownall. He was continuing opening the prosecution case against Barry George, 41, who denies shooting Miss Dando through the head as she crouched on the doorstep of her home in Gowan Avenue, Fulham, south west London, in April 1999. The prosecution alleges that George had an obsession with the Army, guns and celebrities. He had allegedly claimed to be the cousin of the singer with Queen - the late Freddie Mercury - and called himself Barry Bulsara. When police searched his flat they found a number of things relating to weaponry and the Army, the court has heard. In addition were \"other relevant items\", said Mr Pownall. They allegedly included a handwritten note bearing reference to the Big Breakfast - giving a number - and Carlton News London Tonight. There was a piece of paper headed: \"I have got a secret. Room 408\" with a hand-written reference to the BBC, a calling card in the name of George with handwritten note detailing \"Breakfast News\", hand-written references to GMTV and phone numbers and a map showing the location of the BBC shop.",

Quneitra was the most symbolic stop on his itinerary. The town was occupied by Israeli forces in 1967 and destroyed during their withdrawal seven years later.

In the ruined Greek Orthodox church, he prayed for peace and reconciliation in a quavering voice. \"From this place, so disfigured by war, I wish to raise my voice in prayer for peace in the Holy Land and the world,\" he said. A contingent from the UN peacekeeping forces stood outside under their blue flag. Damascus refuses to rebuild the town or let more than a handful of its 50,000 residents return, vowing to preserve it as a macabre shrine to Israeli aggression, until the entire Golan is back in Syrian hands. From this wasteland of razed houses and shell-scarred churches and mosques, Israeli positions and radar posts are clearly visible beyond coils of barbed wire that mark the ceasefire line.

But they generally also contained other elements as well. Their absence in the particle recovered from George's coat led a forensic scientist to conclude \"that the source was a firearm, rather than fireworks\". </p> <p>The prosecution also said it would have been difficult for the coat to have been deliberately contaminated with the particle. </p> <p>\"Great care was taken by the police, none of whom were firearms officers or had access to firearms,\" Mr Pownall said. </p> <p>\"They wore overalls and latex gloves and the coat was sealed in a bag to prevent contamination.\" </p> <p>It was also possible George innocently came into contact with an object bearing a residue particle which was later deposited in his coat pocket, the court heard. The coat and jacket were photographed at the police photographic studio before being examined by a forensic scientist. </p> <p>\"Might the particle have become lodged in the pocket there as a result of contamination from other items photographed at an earlier date? </p> <p>\"We submit that it did not and it is no coincidence that - taken in conjunction with the identification and other surrounding evidence - this defendant happens to have a particle in the inside pocket of his coat which is comprised of the same elements as were found on the coat of Jill Dando and in the same proportion. </p> <p>\"This aspect of the case provides compelling evidence of his guilt,\" said Mr Pownall.</p>",

A particle of discharge residue was found in the pocket of a blue Cecil Gee coat belonging to George which probably came from a firearm, said Orlando Pownall, prosecuting. \"The presence of lead in the particle from the defendant's coat pocket further supports that view as does the similarity in the composition of particles from the defendant's coat and from the coat worn by the deceased.\" X-Ray spectra of two of the particles found in Miss Dando's hair and the particle from the coat were \"very similar in that they contain comparable proportions of the main chemical elements, barium and aluminium. \"The three particles from the hair and the single particle from the coat could all have originated during the firing of the cartridge that contained the cartridge case recovered at Gowan Avenue, (Miss Dando's home address),\" said Mr Pownall. He said fireworks also produced spherical particles of barium and aluminium. But they generally also contained other elements as well. Their absence in the particle recovered from George's coat led a forensic scientist to conclude \"that the source was a firearm, rather than fireworks\". The prosecution also said it would have been difficult for the coat to have been deliberately contaminated with the particle. \"Great care was taken by the police, none of whom were firearms officers or had access to firearms,\" Mr Pownall said. \"They wore overalls and latex gloves and the coat was sealed in a bag to prevent contamination.\" It was also possible George innocently came into contact with an object bearing a residue particle which was later deposited in his coat pocket, the court heard. The coat and jacket were photographed at the police photographic studio before being examined by a forensic scientist. \"Might the particle have become lodged in the pocket there as a result of contamination from other items photographed at an earlier date? \"We submit that it did not and it is no coincidence that - taken in conjunction with the identification and other surrounding evidence - this defendant happens to have a particle in the inside pocket of his coat which is comprised of the same elements as were found on the coat of Jill Dando and in the same proportion. \"This aspect of the case provides compelling evidence of his guilt,\" said Mr Pownall.",

      "body": "<p>In what may turn out to be the most unimaginative election campaign for a generation, voters are expected to ignore politics and stay away from the ballot box in record numbers.</p> <p>This is a mistake. The campaign may not seem exciting but that doesn't mean it is irrelevant. In fact it could shape the nature of Britain. How? Here are five ways it might happen.</p> <p><b>1) The euro</b></p> <p>This election is likely to decide whether Britain joins the single currency.</p> <p>Although all three main parties support versions of the same policy - to hold a referendum on the issue before Britain ever joins - the big question, which will be answered by this campaign, is whether a referendum in the near future is a serious possibility.</p> <p>This means that the next few weeks will really be an election about whether there ought to be an election.</p> <p>Politicians will be watching out for signs that a referendum might be won by the pro-euro camp - and will adjust their positions on the issue accordingly. The less the euro is mentioned on the doorstep and in the media, the more confident the prime minister will be that his aim of holding a referendum in next couple of years is the right one. He thinks that the British public and his cabinet can be persuaded to join - but isn't ready to try convincing them yet.</p> <p>The more the euro crops in the campaign up the more uneasy this will make Tony Blair. If he begins to take a battering now over the single currency - if, for instance, some Labour candidates openly oppose membership - the more cautious he'll be about exposing himself on the issue again in the near future.</p> <p>This will be the case particularly if Labour's line on the euro is seen to help William Hague gain seats his party would otherwise have lost.</p> <p>Likewise, members of the cabinet who are sceptical about the merits of the single currency will harden their line if Labour hits trouble over the issue now.</p> <p>And that matters. Without cabinet backing, Mr Blair cannot get Britain into the single currency. That would not destroy his prime ministership, but it would threaten his place in history.</p> <p><b>2) Parliament</b></p> <p>MPs and journalists alike have complained that since 1997, parliament - and especially the House of Commons - has been moribund. The government's big majority means it runs little risk of defeat, and neither the prime minister nor the chancellor has shown much enthusiasm for attending.</p> <p>The election could change all that. First, if the government is elected with a small majority the Commons will, by the natural force of the mathematics involved, come to matter more. Opposition and dissident government MPs will stand some chance of defeating official policy and, even if they fail, the attempt will at least make the Commons interesting again.</p> <p>Second, if the government retains a big majority then some Labour MPs who have been loyal up until now are likely to build upon the confidence this gives them to demand a greater say. They may try to reinstate the Commons reform process begun after 1997 and may find that the Conservative party, desperate for some means of reining in Tony Blair, is willing to help them. Signs of this are already emerging.</p> <p>There is even some chance that MPs may press for a more dynamic speaker than the current incumbent, Michael Martin, in the hope that this would help put the executive under pressure.</p> <p><b>3) The Liberal Democrats</b></p> <p>This campaign is significant for the Lib Dems in two ways.</p> <p>First, Charles Kennedy, the party's leader, needs to make an impact before polling day. Some opinion polls actually show he is less well known among voters now than when he became leader in 1999. Although all eyes are on William Hague's future as party leader, Mr Kennedy may also find himself under pressure after the election if his party loses seats.</p> <p>Second, the tone of the campaign and its outcome may determine whether the Lib Dems ever enter government. No one imagines that the election will lead to a hung parliament, but a small majority would make the 40-odd Lib Dem MPs an important bulwark for Tony Blair against his left wing. Mr Blair might even decide to press ahead with voting reform, which would give the Lib Dems a chance of getting a share of power.</p> <p>In contrast another massive Labour win would blow reform off the government's agenda.</p> <p><b>4) Scotland</b></p> <p>Scotland has its own government and parliament - unaffected by this election - and the general election will probably be of only passing interest to most voters north of the border.</p> <p>However the general election campaign will test the robustness Scotland's new federal political culture. Are Scots happy that some issues - such as foreign affairs - remain at Westminster while others - such as education - are run from Edinburgh?</p> <p>If the campaign runs smoothly then politicians will take the result as a sign that Scots have come to accept the current halfway house between union and independence, brought in by Labour.</p> <p>Any other result - particularly gains by the opposition SNP - will leave a question mark hanging over devolution and the route to full independence still open.</p> <p><b>5) Tax and spending</b></p> <p>The election could shape the future of the welfare state.</p> <p>Officially, no major British political party proposes great changes to the level of government spending. Even the Liberal Democrats, who talk about the need to increase taxation, plan only small increases above those already announced by Gordon Brown.</p> <p>This means that whatever happens on polling day the welfare state will continue in its current form for at least the next five years.</p> <p>Beyond this, however, policy options begin to differ. Most Conservatives and some Labour ministers see the need for massive welfare reform, handing more responsibility to individuals to provide for themselves. Lib Dems and most Labour MPs disagree.</p> <p>This split is what matters. Will students have to pay the full cost of their education, pensioners fund all their retirement costs and patients pay for medical expenses? Or will the state carry the burden?</p> <p>The election could provide the answer. If Labour is seen to falter, the Conservative party may become more confident about pressing home its claim to be the party of low tax, even if this threatens some services. Likewise Labour will want to avoid discussing possible rises in taxation but may emerge from the campaign convinced that they are, in fact, politically possible.</p> <p>How the public judge these two positions on polling day could decide what happens to the welfare state.</p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/election2001/comment/0,9407,487297,00.html\">08.05.2001: It's painful to be a Tory</a><br> <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/election2001/comment/0,9407,487349,00.html\">08.05.2001: Soundbite truths </a><br> <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/election2001/story/0,9029,487397,00.html\">08.05.2001: Tory 'meltdown' on cards, claim Lib Dems</a><br> <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/election2001/comment/0,9407,487350,00.html\">08.05.2001: Women lose ground</a><br> <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/election2001/comment/0,9407,486830,00.html\">06.05.2001, Andrew Rawnsley: Ready to go to the people</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br> <a href=\"http://politicstalk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee816bf/0\">Debate the issue on Britain's best talkboards</a></p> <p><b>Who are my candidates?</b><br> <a href=\"http://politics-dev.guardianunlimited.co.uk/aristotle/\">Ask Aristotle</a></p> <p><b>Polls</b><br> <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/election2001/story/0,9029,446771,00.html\">Latest polls</a></p> <p><b>Party campaigns</b><br> <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/election2001/archive/0,9359,462124,00.html\">Labour campaign</a><br> <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/election2001/archive/0,9359,447329,00.html\">Conservative campaign</a><br> <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/election2001/archive/0,9359,462125,00.html\">Liberal Democrat campaign</a><br> <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/otherparties/0,9054,443183,00.html\">Other parties campaigns</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.conservative-party.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Conservative party</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.labour.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Labour party</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.libdems.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Liberal Democrats</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.plaid-cymru.wales.com/\" target=\"_new\"> Plaid Cymru</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.snp.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Scottish National party</a><br> <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/westminster/page/0,9132,442756,00.html\"> More political links</a></p>",

If Labour is seen to falter, the Conservative party may become more confident about pressing home its claim to be the party of low tax, even if this threatens some services. Likewise Labour will want to avoid discussing possible rises in taxation but may emerge from the campaign convinced that they are, in fact, politically possible. How the public judge these two positions on polling day could decide what happens to the welfare state.

Go Racing's partners, Channel 4, BSkyB and Arena Leisure, have granted the corporation a 30-day window to exercise its option following the signing of the deal, which is expected to take place on Friday. The BBC will hold onto its existing major horseracing events, including the Grand National, and win back the Derby as part of the TV rights deal it has negotiated with Go Racing. In return the corporation will have to contribute 5% of Go Racing's annual funding for the 10-year duration of the agreement. The BBC director general, Greg Dyke, is also laying the groundwork for a pay-TV sports channel, with NTL its preferred partner. The NTL subsidiary, Premium TV, has also been granted a 70-day window to take a 10% stake in the consortium. This would leave the other three shareholders each with a 28.33% stake. Go Racing has already signed up 32 of the 59 UK racetracks to its agreement and the rest have until Friday to follow suit. But the deal is also conditional upon Arena Leisure raising \u00a360m by the end of June. The publicly listed company, which suspended its shares on April 27, is planning to raise \u00a385m through a share offering to investors. Go Racing has offered \u00a3125m over 10 years for the TV rights to horseracing, which it expects to recoup from selling on the rights to broadcasters. The consortium has also promised the racing industry a \u00a3195m minimum guaranteed share of betting and other revenue from media rights exploitation over the same period. In addition, it has committed to spending at least \u00a380m on marketing the sport. Go Racing is planning to fund these payments in part with \u00a350m from initial broadcast licensing income and a loan from Arena Leisure. The consortium's shareholders, including the BBC and NTL if they take up their stakes, will contribute a further \u00a370m, with individual contributions dependent on each backer's shareholding. Separately, Arena Leisure has agreed to provide \u00a380m in funding to Go Racing as part of a loan facility over the 10 years of the agreement. In return, the racecourse owner will receive 3% of gross betting turnover from all Go Racing media outlets. Go Racing is planning to launch a horseracing pay-TV channel and website, which will both offer an interactive betting service, as well as sub-licensing TV and radio rights to broadcasters including the BBC. Channel 4 and BSkyB will also continue to broadcast horseracing. The Go Racing pay-TV channel will have carriage on Sky Digital, digital terrestrial and NTL's cable networks. Arena's Trackplay system will be the technology used to drive the Go Racing interactive betting service. Go Racing will offer a pool betting service, which operates in a way similar to a lottery, rather than fixed odds betting.

      "body": "<p>Car relaunches are quite frequently less exciting than car manufacturers would like us to believe. What gets trumpeted as an earnest return to the drawing board, leading to a fearlessly radical reappraisal of an old motoring favourite, often turns out, on closer inspection, to be the same old car with a slightly differently shaped gear fob and a minutely foreshortened indicator stalk. </p> <p>In some cases, a fractionally improved braking system might be in place, but its effects will be discernible only to Michael Schumacher and those with the gift of extra-sensory perception. </p> <p>Hyundai seems, at first sight, to be going for new records in this department with their relaunch of the Elantra, which arrives among us with an extra letter in its name from last time out. The Elantra used to be known as the Lantra, though only in Britain. In the rest of the world - or at least in those extensive parts of it in which the Korean company sells cars - it was known as the Elantra. Here, Lotus, who make a car called an Elan, objected to the use of the word Elantra on trademark grounds. </p> <p>You can see Lotus's point: on the one hand, the Elantra, a cut-price saloon, aimed at people who would probably like a BMW but can only budget for half of one; on the other hand, the Elan, a sharply angled, deeply uneconomical, pigeon-frightening road-burner, aimed at hobbyists looking for pure pleasure from their third car. People were going to be getting them mixed up all the time. </p> <p>Recently, however, Lotus must have decided to say \"What the heck\" because Hyundai is now free to release a British Elantra and unify the global brand under the one title. </p> <p>Apart from the fact the car now takes longer to write, the new model does make some advances on the now discontinued Lantra, and not all of them of the order of \"new soundproofing under the rear shelf\" and \"improved gear teeth design\" in the manual transmission. </p> <p>For instance, consider the new position of the passenger's airbag - not where it used to be, halfway up the dashboard, but stuffed under a panel on top. According to Hyundai, this \"helps further to reduce the risk of injury on inflation\". There we all were thinking that airbags were intended to spare you from injury, when actually it turns out they are lethal if they catch you from the wrong angle. Is nothing safe? </p> <p>I was unable to find a passenger willing to let me put these claims for the airbag to the test, so we will have to take Hyundai's word for it. They should know. While building the Elantra, they involved it in no fewer than 150 collisions, which was either very thorough of them or very careless. </p> <p>Another difference from the Lantra: the new car is wider, taller and longer. Altogether, its shape looks something like a throwback to the early 1980s, before cars - even saloons - took it upon themselves to turn all snubby on us. Hyundai seems to have thought: \"If Duran Duran can come back, then why not cars that have the Ford Granada as their template?\" </p> <p>Whatever, the Elantra is now more capacious than many of the rivals in its class, including the Vauxhall Vectra and the Nissan Primera. Hyundai even fearlessly points out that the Elantra is bigger than the Volvo 540 - so is a Portakabin, but that doesn't mean that people who have it in mind to buy a Volvo are likely to change their ideas and purchase a demountable building instead. </p> <p>Nor, probably, an Elantra. For all the safety testing and the minute attention to airbags, there seemed to me to be something thin and frail about it, and something very definitely at a remove from Volvo's big lumps of Swedish metal. The boot on the Elantra closes with a confidence-sapping \"poink\". The door handles are as light as cup cakes and the doors themselves seem to share certain important physical qualities with Coke cans.

      "bodyText": "Car relaunches are quite frequently less exciting than car manufacturers would like us to believe. What gets trumpeted as an earnest return to the drawing board, leading to a fearlessly radical reappraisal of an old motoring favourite, often turns out, on closer inspection, to be the same old car with a slightly differently shaped gear fob and a minutely foreshortened indicator stalk. In some cases, a fractionally improved braking system might be in place, but its effects will be discernible only to Michael Schumacher and those with the gift of extra-sensory perception. Hyundai seems, at first sight, to be going for new records in this department with their relaunch of the Elantra, which arrives among us with an extra letter in its name from last time out. The Elantra used to be known as the Lantra, though only in Britain. In the rest of the world - or at least in those extensive parts of it in which the Korean company sells cars - it was known as the Elantra. Here, Lotus, who make a car called an Elan, objected to the use of the word Elantra on trademark grounds. You can see Lotus's point: on the one hand, the Elantra, a cut-price saloon, aimed at people who would probably like a BMW but can only budget for half of one; on the other hand, the Elan, a sharply angled, deeply uneconomical, pigeon-frightening road-burner, aimed at hobbyists looking for pure pleasure from their third car. People were going to be getting them mixed up all the time. Recently, however, Lotus must have decided to say \"What the heck\" because Hyundai is now free to release a British Elantra and unify the global brand under the one title. Apart from the fact the car now takes longer to write, the new model does make some advances on the now discontinued Lantra, and not all of them of the order of \"new soundproofing under the rear shelf\" and \"improved gear teeth design\" in the manual transmission. For instance, consider the new position of the passenger's airbag - not where it used to be, halfway up the dashboard, but stuffed under a panel on top. According to Hyundai, this \"helps further to reduce the risk of injury on inflation\". There we all were thinking that airbags were intended to spare you from injury, when actually it turns out they are lethal if they catch you from the wrong angle. Is nothing safe? I was unable to find a passenger willing to let me put these claims for the airbag to the test, so we will have to take Hyundai's word for it. They should know. While building the Elantra, they involved it in no fewer than 150 collisions, which was either very thorough of them or very careless. Another difference from the Lantra: the new car is wider, taller and longer. Altogether, its shape looks something like a throwback to the early 1980s, before cars - even saloons - took it upon themselves to turn all snubby on us. Hyundai seems to have thought: \"If Duran Duran can come back, then why not cars that have the Ford Granada as their template?\" Whatever, the Elantra is now more capacious than many of the rivals in its class, including the Vauxhall Vectra and the Nissan Primera. Hyundai even fearlessly points out that the Elantra is bigger than the Volvo 540 - so is a Portakabin, but that doesn't mean that people who have it in mind to buy a Volvo are likely to change their ideas and purchase a demountable building instead. Nor, probably, an Elantra. For all the safety testing and the minute attention to airbags, there seemed to me to be something thin and frail about it, and something very definitely at a remove from Volvo's big lumps of Swedish metal. The boot on the Elantra closes with a confidence-sapping \"poink\". The door handles are as light as cup cakes and the doors themselves seem to share certain important physical qualities with Coke cans. As for the ridges along the bonnet and down the side of the car, they add a fizz to the car's appearance, but they also look like something you might have put in it yourself, with access to a metal ruler and a steady hand. Inside, it's the places where the car attempts to score points for luxury that the Elantra most reveals its nature. The top of the range 2.0 CDX that I drove contained large amounts of slippery leather and an acre or two of mock walnut, as if attempting to look like the library in a stately home. That's not such a bad idea in itself, but unfortunately the walnut was so triumphantly mock, it looked more plastic than the parts of the dashboard, which weren't pretending to be anything else. To drive, the car was slick to the touch - all easy gear changes and light pedals - but it wasn't really the driving that stayed in the mind; it was the contrary nature of Hyundai's achievement, at this of all times. As manufacturers compete to produce ever bigger bargains in ever more surprising packages, Hyundai has pulled off a trick whose effects are almost reassuring: the production of a car that is not only cheap, but feels like it.",

      "body": "<p>A damp spring morning in a stately home not far from Barnet, north London. Just visible behind the half-open drawing room door are a pair of feet seemingly suspended in mid-air. They belong to 76-year-old auteur Robert Altman, who (it turns out) is having a nap on his reclining \"director's chair\" between set-ups of Gosford Park. </p> <p>Gosford Park is something of a landmark for Altman, being the first time he's come to Britain to shoot a movie. He pitches it as \"Ten Little Indians meets Rules of the Game\" - a murder-mystery set during a shooting party at a country house in 1932. </p> <p>As a rule in film-making, sets teeter on the brink of chaos: actors throw fits, producers fret about schedules, accountants worry about budget over-spends, technicians grumble. On Gosford Park, there is no sense of panic. Altman is relaxed - and so is everyone else. While the director snoozes soundly in the drawing room, his crew prepare the next set-up in the dining room. Ladders, cables, masking tape, and lights are strewn all over the place. The antique furniture has been pushed to one side to make space for the camera monitors. </p> <p>The cast members are sitting around in evening dress (white tie and ballgowns), smoking cigarettes and doing crossword puzzles. A glum-looking Charles Dance wanders by, looking like a mannequin from Moss Bros. Jeremy Northam (who plays Ivor Novello) is practising his piano playing. There are John Singer Sargent portraits of grandes dames in the hall, but none are as haughty or as elegant as Dame Maggie Smith who is touching up her hair and tiara in the gilt-framed mirror. </p> <p>What has brought Altman to England? Last year he threatened to leave the US if George Bush was elected president. Whether or not that is why he has set up camp in the Home Counties, he certainly likes English actors. \"English actors are unquestionably the best,\" he states, as if it is a matter of fact, not opinion. \"I think that has more to do with the culture than with the theatre. Children are taught to behave in a certain way and in behaving that way, they are disguising their real selves and so they become actors. I don't think that happens so much in other societies.\" </p> <p>Much of the financing for the \u00a310m feature comes from the UK's new super-quango, the Film Council. In other words, Altman is relying on public funds from the lottery. Inevitably, there have already been grumblings among British producers about the Film Council's decision to make its first significant investment in a movie directed by an American. This doesn't worry the film-maker. \"My dear,\" he says, waking from his nap. \"I think every dollar or pound that comes down the pike is tainted. I don't have the slightest problem whether it's drug money from Nicaragua, British lottery money, or from skim-off in Las Vegas. It doesn't make any difference. And what's lottery money supposed to be spent on - curing sheep or something?\" </p> <p>The Film Council has also been trumpeting the need for lottery-funded film-makers to think commercially. Altman, though, seems blithely unconcerned about Gosford Park's eventual box-office fate. \"I'm more interested in serving and rewarding the artists than I am the audience,\" he says. \"The audience I can't really care about. They can come and see it if they want - I hope they do, I hope they like it - but I don't think about them when I'm making the film. I think about myself and the other artists I am collaborating with.\" </p> <p>The movie has had a remarkably swift gestation. Altman and producer Bob Balaban were keen to make a film set in a 1930s country house. They commandeered English actor-novelist Julian Fellowes to write the screenplay, telling him the basic ingredients they needed: a murder, tension between upstairs and downstairs, and sexual intrigue. Altman was keen to include music from the period - hence the decision to make matinee idol/composer Ivor Novello the one real-life character in the story. Fellowes first set to work in early 2000. Less than a year later, the film was fully financed and ready to shoot. </p> <p>No, Altman says, he's not a fan of Agatha Christie novels. His interest is in the period: the manners, the nuances of the class system, and the seemingly unbridgeable gulf between the life lived upstairs and what happens in the servants' quarters. When he was growing up in Kansas City in the 1930s, his family had a maid (she introduced him to jazz), but the excesses of English country house living still startle him. </p> <p>The 1930s, Altman believes, were the last hurrah for old-style English country house living. The days when working-class women's career opportunities boiled down to two stark choices (\"If they weren't housemaids, they'd probably have to be prostitutes,\" says Altman) had already passed. Within a few years, the master-servant relationship was to break down for good. \"By the end of the second world war, this sort of thing was over. That's why in all these stately homes, people live in one wing of them and have tours of the rest, or rent them out to folks like me.\" </p> <p>Ever the fatalist, Altman is already resigned to being at tacked. \"The big criticism that will come to me is: 'What are you doing making an English film about manners?' \" he says, scratching his beard. \"I suppose if I was a Hungarian, it wouldn't be so bad, but the idea that an American is doing this will undoubtedly draw fire from the British press, which is almost as bad as the American press. I'm going to get criticised, but I don't much care. That will just keep a smile on my face.\" </p> <p>Still, he is determined to get the etiquette right and has even invited various former butlers and maids on set to advise the actors just which knife or fork each character would have used first at dinner. Fellowes is also on hand to stop any anachronisms creeping into the dialogue. </p> <p>At lunch, everyone is allowed into the makeshift theatre in the parking lot to watch the previous day's rushes. Altman sits at the front, cracking jokes with Balaban (who has a part in the movie as a Hollywood producer who has come to England to research his new movie, Charlie Chan in London). Alan Bates, still in his stiff-fronted butler's costume and looking as if he has just stumbled out of a Charles Addams cartoon, is a few rows further back. We're watching what will probably turn out to be the closing sequence: the guests are leaving, the butler is closing the front door, and the camera is panning round from the house, taking in the parkland and fields. Altman is happy with the shot until he notices some electric pylons peeping through the foliage. </p> <p>As usual on an Altman film, the actors, all 40 or so of them, are singing the director's praises. His secret, according to actor Ryan Phillippe (one of the few Americans in the cast), is that \"he makes everyone feel important. A lot of directors like to intimidate you, but he breaks down the barriers.\" Jeremy Northam agrees. \"Bob has a great way of seeing when people are comfortable and then finding the best way of shooting. And there's always a sense of playfulness.\" </p> <p>Today is an \"upstairs\" day. That means few of the servants are around. After lunch, Altman sets to work filming a tricky dinner party sequence. Kristin Scott-Thomas is at one end of the table; her parvenu businessman husband (a dyspeptic-looking Michael Gambon) is at the other with his pet dog on his lap. The scene climaxes with Gambon storming out of the room. Altman shoots in a very particular style, keeping two cameras running all the time and wiring up the actors with hidden microphones. \"We put one on everybody,\" he says. \"Even if they don't have scripted lines, there's behavioural stuff in which people speak. Everyone goes at once. It's a three-ring circus. And if we scripted every word that everyone says in this picture, the script would be about 500 pages long.\" </p> <p>Gosford Park is a homage of sorts to the Agatha Christie-style crime caper, complete with detective (Stephen Fry) and multiple suspects, but whereas the English crime writer was known for her mastery of structure, Altman is famous for his freewheeling, improvisatory style. It somehow doesn't come as a surprise to learn that there are 25 different plot strands to Gosford Park, that the actors are being encouraged to ad lib, and that Altman is considering enlisting Dave Stewart to write the music. (\"But it could be the London Symphony Orchestra and John Williams for all I know.\") </p> <p>It's a long while since Altman made a Hollywood studio movie (\"they make gloves and I make shoes\"). His films are financed independently. He doesn't fret about where the money for them comes from. What matters is to keep on working. Has he ever thought of quitting? Altman seems nonplussed by the question. \"Retirement?\" he repeats the word. \"You're talking about death, right?\" Then he rushes back on set for the next shot.</p>",

They can come and see it if they want - I hope they do, I hope they like it - but I don't think about them when I'm making the film. I think about myself and the other artists I am collaborating with.\" The movie has had a remarkably swift gestation. Altman and producer Bob Balaban were keen to make a film set in a 1930s country house. They commandeered English actor-novelist Julian Fellowes to write the screenplay, telling him the basic ingredients they needed: a murder, tension between upstairs and downstairs, and sexual intrigue. Altman was keen to include music from the period - hence the decision to make matinee idol/composer Ivor Novello the one real-life character in the story. Fellowes first set to work in early 2000. Less than a year later, the film was fully financed and ready to shoot. No, Altman says, he's not a fan of Agatha Christie novels. His interest is in the period: the manners, the nuances of the class system, and the seemingly unbridgeable gulf between the life lived upstairs and what happens in the servants' quarters. When he was growing up in Kansas City in the 1930s, his family had a maid (she introduced him to jazz), but the excesses of English country house living still startle him. The 1930s, Altman believes, were the last hurrah for old-style English country house living. The days when working-class women's career opportunities boiled down to two stark choices (\"If they weren't housemaids, they'd probably have to be prostitutes,\" says Altman) had already passed. Within a few years, the master-servant relationship was to break down for good. \"By the end of the second world war, this sort of thing was over. That's why in all these stately homes, people live in one wing of them and have tours of the rest, or rent them out to folks like me.\" Ever the fatalist, Altman is already resigned to being at tacked. \"The big criticism that will come to me is: 'What are you doing making an English film about manners?' \" he says, scratching his beard. \"I suppose if I was a Hungarian, it wouldn't be so bad, but the idea that an American is doing this will undoubtedly draw fire from the British press, which is almost as bad as the American press. I'm going to get criticised, but I don't much care. That will just keep a smile on my face.\" Still, he is determined to get the etiquette right and has even invited various former butlers and maids on set to advise the actors just which knife or fork each character would have used first at dinner. Fellowes is also on hand to stop any anachronisms creeping into the dialogue. At lunch, everyone is allowed into the makeshift theatre in the parking lot to watch the previous day's rushes. Altman sits at the front, cracking jokes with Balaban (who has a part in the movie as a Hollywood producer who has come to England to research his new movie, Charlie Chan in London). Alan Bates, still in his stiff-fronted butler's costume and looking as if he has just stumbled out of a Charles Addams cartoon, is a few rows further back. We're watching what will probably turn out to be the closing sequence: the guests are leaving, the butler is closing the front door, and the camera is panning round from the house, taking in the parkland and fields. Altman is happy with the shot until he notices some electric pylons peeping through the foliage. As usual on an Altman film, the actors, all 40 or so of them, are singing the director's praises. His secret, according to actor Ryan Phillippe (one of the few Americans in the cast), is that \"he makes everyone feel important. A lot of directors like to intimidate you, but he breaks down the barriers.\" Jeremy Northam agrees. \"Bob has a great way of seeing when people are comfortable and then finding the best way of shooting. And there's always a sense of playfulness.\" Today is an \"upstairs\" day. That means few of the servants are around. After lunch, Altman sets to work filming a tricky dinner party sequence. Kristin Scott-Thomas is at one end of the table; her parvenu businessman husband (a dyspeptic-looking Michael Gambon) is at the other with his pet dog on his lap. The scene climaxes with Gambon storming out of the room. Altman shoots in a very particular style, keeping two cameras running all the time and wiring up the actors with hidden microphones. \"We put one on everybody,\" he says. \"Even if they don't have scripted lines, there's behavioural stuff in which people speak. Everyone goes at once. It's a three-ring circus. And if we scripted every word that everyone says in this picture, the script would be about 500 pages long.\" Gosford Park is a homage of sorts to the Agatha Christie-style crime caper, complete with detective (Stephen Fry) and multiple suspects, but whereas the English crime writer was known for her mastery of structure, Altman is famous for his freewheeling, improvisatory style. It somehow doesn't come as a surprise to learn that there are 25 different plot strands to Gosford Park, that the actors are being encouraged to ad lib, and that Altman is considering enlisting Dave Stewart to write the music. (\"But it could be the London Symphony Orchestra and John Williams for all I know.\") It's a long while since Altman made a Hollywood studio movie (\"they make gloves and I make shoes\"). His films are financed independently. He doesn't fret about where the money for them comes from. What matters is to keep on working. Has he ever thought of quitting? Altman seems nonplussed by the question. \"Retirement?\" he repeats the word. \"You're talking about death, right?\" Then he rushes back on set for the next shot.",

With the cracks to the engine's cooling system repaired, the hunter killer submarine left harbour early in the morning. British sailors waved at a crowd of onlookers, mainly Spanish journalists. Spaniards have been waiting for a year to see the back of the submarine. \"Our greatest desire is that it should never come back,\" said Martin Caballero, of the Spanish Plataforma Anti-Submarino, which has been protesting about the submarine since it limped into harbour on May 19 last year. The group gathered 60,000 protesters together at the frontier with Gibraltar earlier this year. Gibraltar's chief minister, Peter Caruana, has had to tread a difficult line between addressing local worries over the safety of the submarine repairs and a desire not to rock the boat with the Royal Navy. \"The Ministry of Defence is Gibraltar's second biggest employer,\" said a government spokesman. Yesterday Mr Caruana left open the possibility that Gibraltar would legislate against submarine repairs being carried out if the navy did not come up with safety guarantees. Private opinion polls in Gibraltar put those opposed to Tireless's presence at between 50% and 70%. In the past 16 years the percentage of Gibraltar's working population employed by the MoD has fallen from 60% to 6%. A Royal Navy spokesman, Captain Paul Wilkinson, described the submarine as \"operationally fit\" and said it would not need further repair once it reached Britain. Officials refused to say where the submarine was heading. The row over Tireless, which led to the Spanish prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar, being criticised at home for not insisting that it be moved back to Britain for repair, provoked a new debate over the status of a colony that Britain acquired under the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht.",

      "byline": "Michael White",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>\"Whatever you do, don't believe the opinion polls,\" snapped a weary Labour MP at the endlong Sunday spent canvassing the marginal seat in southern England that he had captured in the Great Landslide of 1997. \"We're finding there are a lot of people out there who haven't made up their minds.\"</p> <p>It was an odd remark. Surely this was supposed to be an election where people had made up their minds long ago? Despite that rictus smile and his gratingly inclusive rhetoric, despite the petrol crisis and foot and mouth, Tony Blair was going to win a historic second term for Labour: no Labour government in the 20th century had managed to win a proper working majority in two successive elections.</p> <p>It is impossible to underestimate the extent to which that fact has haunted the first Blair administration. After 18 grim, frustrating years in opposition a generation of Labour politicians had emerged, hungry for power, not just for its own sake (though there was that too) but in order to do things.</p> <p>It was an ambitious agenda. They wanted to tackle hardcore unemployment and social exclusion in the name of the \"opportunity society\", boost investment in people and new technologies as well as long neglected public services, to reform an over-centralised constitution and take the paranoia and neurosis out of relations with Europe. They even talked grandly of restoring a confident \"civic society\" eroded by a century of decline and retreat.</p> <p>Blair knew from the start that it would take at least two terms to achieve this vision.</p> <p>It will be the central issue of the coming campaign. Will voters accept Labour's assurances that the new school roofs and hospitals that are at last in view are the down payment on a more fundamental restructuring of society? Or will William Hague's taunts that Labour is \"all spin and no substance\" strike a cynical chord with voters? Hague's tactics are deliberate, ministers say. He is the first opposition leader in history who would prefer people not to vote at all.</p> <p>After 1997, early efforts to rebrand Britain as a young country, even a cool one were, admittedly, clumsy. \"Modernise\" was a better word and Blair gradually came to prefer it. Gordon Brown set the pace on the fifth day of the new order when he granted independence to the monetary policy committee of the Bank of England to set interest rates. The City was impressed, as it was when the new chancellor doggedly stuck to the Conservative spending plans he had inherited for the first two years in office.</p> <p>Whenever the author of those plans, Ken Clarke, protested that he himself would never have stuck to them, it was the cue for Brown and Blair to remind voters of the rollercoaster boom and bust years of Tory economic management that had left them a mountain of debt to pay off.</p> <p>The freeze on spending was the crucial strategic decision of the government and it carried a price tag. Labour has only won three proper working majorities, by 143 seats in 1945, and by 97 in 1966 after a narrow win in 1964. The Attlee government of 1945 created the postwar order that lasted until the Thatcher years, including the national health service, a socialist institution so popular that it survived even her flying handbag. Though the 1966 government had solid social reforms to its credit it proved an economic failure.</p> <p>The biggest landslide of all was 1997. With 179 seats clear of all the other parties combined, it served to rekindle the fires of expectation that Labour's campaign had been designed to douse. Why couldn't this government do anything it wanted, from banning fox hunting to restoring the link between pensions and earnings. Key ministers preferred to placate mythical Middle England, offsetting a radical gesture here with some reactionary rhetoric there, and never admitting in the Daily Mail's hearing that it was putting taxes up. Determined, above all, to establish their credentials as sound economic managers they did not start pumping money into the NHS and the school system on the scale that modernisation required until the third year in office. By that stage even the hapless Tories had managed to make stealth taxes an issue.</p> <p>Labour activists were disappointed. Heartland voters wondered if this public school lawyer with fashionable metropolitan habits was really \"one of us\"? There might have been real trouble if so many experienced Tory hands hadn't quit the field after their routing at the polls. But the Tories picked the 36-year-old ex-Welsh secretary, William Hague, instead of the bruiser, Ken Clarke, to succeed John Major, whose premiership had been crippled by infighting, most bloodily over Europe.</p> <p>Hague took time to find his feet (and lose his baseball cap), and had to focus his efforts on reconsolidating the core Tory vote, the millions who had voted for the Referendum and UK Independence parties in 1997 or the 2m of them who stayed at home. Even with Michael Portillo back on board after his Kensington and Chelsea byelection win in 1999, the shadow cabinet's ineptitude gave the Blairites useful room for manoeuvre. Its tendency to reverse not just Major's policies but its own discouraged the Murdoch and Rothermere press, which Blair had wooed so tenderly, from slipping back to its natural anti-Labour habits.</p> <p>In any case, the new prime minister, four days short of his 44th birthday, could sleep soundly in the flat above the shop knowing that, if his own left wing gave him trouble (it rarely did), he could turn to Paddy Ashdown and the 46 Liberal Democrat MPs. They had been swept into Westminster on Labour's tide, partly through luck and tactical voting, but also as a tribute to Ashdown's decision to end equidistance and cosy up to Blair.</p> <p>Ashdown's unconsummated passion for the project was one of the disappointments of the 1997 parliament for constitutional reformers of the centrist persuasion. They were proving hard to please. Mr Blair had presided over more constitutional reform than any prime minister since 1832, another anti-Tory landslide year. It included devolution, the Human Rights Act, Freedom of Information, reform at the Bank of England, a smattering of PR elections, even - 100 years after Keir Hardie mooted it - the expulsion of all but 92 hereditary legislators. Blair and Robin Cook, his foreign secretary, went so far as to set up a Lib-Lab consultative committee to the annoyance of their colleagues.</p> <p>Ashdown, whose diaries later revealed how close he had got to achieving coalition politics in 1997, remained disappointed. When he duly stood down as Liberal Democrat leader in 1999 and became Sir Paddy (but not United Nations supremo in Kosovo as he had once hoped), Charles Kennedy beat Simon Hughes to the vacancy, as most people expected.</p> <p>Kennedy was a Highland Scot but few people realised he was also secular Britain's first Catholic political leader for 300 years. He had a more realistic view of progress: he even ducked confrontation over Blair's waning enthusiasm for PR elections at Westminster, though he did echo Ashdown's complaint that failure to hold the promised referendum on membership of the eurozone in 1997 or 1998 was a lost opportunity. If they are right, predict some, that fateful delay might one day trigger a No vote that could destroy the Blair premiership.</p> <p>\"Where's the beef, Charlie?\" asked some more ardent Lib Dems. Mr Kennedy neither jogged, policy-wonked, nor arm-wrestled on BBC radio's Today programme.

Unlike every previous Labour government since 1923 that has spent first and retrenched later, this one has placed itself brilliantly to meet such expectations by stuffing money down the public sector's throat as election day looms.

But there is little evidence that he turns to last.minute.free-holiday.com to book his annual trips to Italy and France, the heart of Europe he so often invokes in speeches. Significantly perhaps, Brown usually holidays at his own expense on Cape Cod, closer to Harvard's policy wonks and its bulging libraries.</p> <p>Aware of charges that the government has become complacent or arrogant (charges that helped to cripple Harold Wilson in 1970), Blair and his team have taken to thanking voters for allowing them to modernise Britain. They will campaign apologetically for not having done enough fast enough, promising to deliver assorted 10 years plans in the new parliament, and hoping against hope to offload the embarrassing dome in Greenwich before Hague makes it the campaign symbol of Labour extravagance and vacuity.</p> <p>Hague has other targets, such as the rise in violent crime (though not all crime), the seemingly insoluble problem of asylum-seekers heading for Dover from southern Europe and Asia. Labour's Queen's Speech produced a raft of measures designed to shrink the target area. Jack Straw's 10 year crime plan in late February was part of that strategy.</p> <p>But Blair's real hope, confirmed by private polling, lies in Hague's Billy Bandwagon tendency to jump aboard passing issues highlighted by Sun editorials, and the well remembered legacy of boom and bust economics under Thatcher and Major.

No wonder the promised Tory tax cuts for pensioners and families seem to make little impact. It is still too soon to be forgiven or forgotten.</p> <p>Try as they may the Hague team sounds to many Tories (and Tory tabloids) like New Labour wannabes on days when they aren't sounding a bit too much like Austria's Jorg Heider on the EU or asylum-seekers, important issues to their core voters. \"We do not have an ideology,\" Hague told the BBC. Indeed not, and it shows.</p> <p>None the less Hague, who needs an improbable 8% overall swing to win outright, persists in saying he will surprise everyone and win, as Ted Heath did in 1970.

It is not over yet.

      "bodyText": "\"Whatever you do, don't believe the opinion polls,\" snapped a weary Labour MP at the endlong Sunday spent canvassing the marginal seat in southern England that he had captured in the Great Landslide of 1997. \"We're finding there are a lot of people out there who haven't made up their minds.\" It was an odd remark. Surely this was supposed to be an election where people had made up their minds long ago? Despite that rictus smile and his gratingly inclusive rhetoric, despite the petrol crisis and foot and mouth, Tony Blair was going to win a historic second term for Labour: no Labour government in the 20th century had managed to win a proper working majority in two successive elections. It is impossible to underestimate the extent to which that fact has haunted the first Blair administration. After 18 grim, frustrating years in opposition a generation of Labour politicians had emerged, hungry for power, not just for its own sake (though there was that too) but in order to do things. It was an ambitious agenda. They wanted to tackle hardcore unemployment and social exclusion in the name of the \"opportunity society\", boost investment in people and new technologies as well as long neglected public services, to reform an over-centralised constitution and take the paranoia and neurosis out of relations with Europe. They even talked grandly of restoring a confident \"civic society\" eroded by a century of decline and retreat. Blair knew from the start that it would take at least two terms to achieve this vision. It will be the central issue of the coming campaign. Will voters accept Labour's assurances that the new school roofs and hospitals that are at last in view are the down payment on a more fundamental restructuring of society? Or will William Hague's taunts that Labour is \"all spin and no substance\" strike a cynical chord with voters? Hague's tactics are deliberate, ministers say. He is the first opposition leader in history who would prefer people not to vote at all. After 1997, early efforts to rebrand Britain as a young country, even a cool one were, admittedly, clumsy. \"Modernise\" was a better word and Blair gradually came to prefer it. Gordon Brown set the pace on the fifth day of the new order when he granted independence to the monetary policy committee of the Bank of England to set interest rates. The City was impressed, as it was when the new chancellor doggedly stuck to the Conservative spending plans he had inherited for the first two years in office. Whenever the author of those plans, Ken Clarke, protested that he himself would never have stuck to them, it was the cue for Brown and Blair to remind voters of the rollercoaster boom and bust years of Tory economic management that had left them a mountain of debt to pay off. The freeze on spending was the crucial strategic decision of the government and it carried a price tag. Labour has only won three proper working majorities, by 143 seats in 1945, and by 97 in 1966 after a narrow win in 1964. The Attlee government of 1945 created the postwar order that lasted until the Thatcher years, including the national health service, a socialist institution so popular that it survived even her flying handbag. Though the 1966 government had solid social reforms to its credit it proved an economic failure. The biggest landslide of all was 1997. With 179 seats clear of all the other parties combined, it served to rekindle the fires of expectation that Labour's campaign had been designed to douse. Why couldn't this government do anything it wanted, from banning fox hunting to restoring the link between pensions and earnings. Key ministers preferred to placate mythical Middle England, offsetting a radical gesture here with some reactionary rhetoric there, and never admitting in the Daily Mail's hearing that it was putting taxes up. Determined, above all, to establish their credentials as sound economic managers they did not start pumping money into the NHS and the school system on the scale that modernisation required until the third year in office. By that stage even the hapless Tories had managed to make stealth taxes an issue. Labour activists were disappointed. Heartland voters wondered if this public school lawyer with fashionable metropolitan habits was really \"one of us\"? There might have been real trouble if so many experienced Tory hands hadn't quit the field after their routing at the polls. But the Tories picked the 36-year-old ex-Welsh secretary, William Hague, instead of the bruiser, Ken Clarke, to succeed John Major, whose premiership had been crippled by infighting, most bloodily over Europe. Hague took time to find his feet (and lose his baseball cap), and had to focus his efforts on reconsolidating the core Tory vote, the millions who had voted for the Referendum and UK Independence parties in 1997 or the 2m of them who stayed at home. Even with Michael Portillo back on board after his Kensington and Chelsea byelection win in 1999, the shadow cabinet's ineptitude gave the Blairites useful room for manoeuvre. Its tendency to reverse not just Major's policies but its own discouraged the Murdoch and Rothermere press, which Blair had wooed so tenderly, from slipping back to its natural anti-Labour habits. In any case, the new prime minister, four days short of his 44th birthday, could sleep soundly in the flat above the shop knowing that, if his own left wing gave him trouble (it rarely did), he could turn to Paddy Ashdown and the 46 Liberal Democrat MPs. They had been swept into Westminster on Labour's tide, partly through luck and tactical voting, but also as a tribute to Ashdown's decision to end equidistance and cosy up to Blair. Ashdown's unconsummated passion for the project was one of the disappointments of the 1997 parliament for constitutional reformers of the centrist persuasion. They were proving hard to please. Mr Blair had presided over more constitutional reform than any prime minister since 1832, another anti-Tory landslide year. It included devolution, the Human Rights Act, Freedom of Information, reform at the Bank of England, a smattering of PR elections, even - 100 years after Keir Hardie mooted it - the expulsion of all but 92 hereditary legislators. Blair and Robin Cook, his foreign secretary, went so far as to set up a Lib-Lab consultative committee to the annoyance of their colleagues. Ashdown, whose diaries later revealed how close he had got to achieving coalition politics in 1997, remained disappointed. When he duly stood down as Liberal Democrat leader in 1999 and became Sir Paddy (but not United Nations supremo in Kosovo as he had once hoped), Charles Kennedy beat Simon Hughes to the vacancy, as most people expected. Kennedy was a Highland Scot but few people realised he was also secular Britain's first Catholic political leader for 300 years. He had a more realistic view of progress: he even ducked confrontation over Blair's waning enthusiasm for PR elections at Westminster, though he did echo Ashdown's complaint that failure to hold the promised referendum on membership of the eurozone in 1997 or 1998 was a lost opportunity. If they are right, predict some, that fateful delay might one day trigger a No vote that could destroy the Blair premiership. \"Where's the beef, Charlie?\" asked some more ardent Lib Dems. Mr Kennedy neither jogged, policy-wonked, nor arm-wrestled on BBC radio's Today programme. True, he had won a famous victory in the Romsey byelection of May 2000 by taking anti-asylum sentiment head on. In his amiable way Kennedy claimed to be appealing to fair play and the growing anti-political mood. But will his laidback style give Hague a chance to win back southern seats lost to tactical anti-Tory votes in 1997? And will the post-election mathematics at Westminster give him any more leverage over Blair than the very little leverage that 46 MPs has given him? Such imponderables kept the pundits employed and guaranteed that, however dull the campaign might (or might not) prove to be, the results would be interesting. Hartlepool, for example, may be the Enfield Southgate of the season with the twice-dropped Peter Mandelson as the whipping boy for voter disappointment as Portillo was the last time round. All the same, smart, metropolitan dinner party chat in the winter before the election focussed on the size of Labour's overall majority. Would it be bigger than last time? Some people looked at Hague's poll ratings and thought it might be. Labour HQ in Millbank mischievously targeted a dozen Tory seats for capture, just to pile on the pressure. \"I sometimes sit there wishing I could set up a consultancy and give them lessons in opposition,\" murmured one cabinet minister. Not even Mandelson's second resignation from cabinet over the Hinduja passport affair on January 24 seemed to unsettle the opinion polls, however much it left the prime minister bereft of his closest cabinet chum, a buffer against rampant Brownism in the campaign planning and beyond. Blair would be much more assured than the untested opposition leader he had been in 1997, MPs predicted, and the Labour campaign team might be less split by factions. But Mandelson's energy and his sensitivity to the aspirations of floating voters - Worcester Woman and Mondeo Man had been rebranded as Pebbledash People by some pollsters - would be missed. Tory efforts to portray Labour as sleazier than the Tories under Major, with scandals over Ecclestone, Robinson, Mandelson (twice), Vaz, even Lord Irvine's \"cash for wigs\" fundraising letter, were noted by voters, the polls confirmed.

Consumer choice applies to politics too. It is hardly surprising then that Millbank strategists fret over stay-at-home voters, against apathy and Hague induced cynicism, even as they quietly focus their efforts and their hi-tech, customised email-shots on saving key marginals. It is not over yet. Hence the cold Sunday evening report from that class of 97 Labour MP who will only lose on a 6% swing. \"There are a lot of people out there who have not made up their minds.\" \u0095 Michael White is the Guardian's political editor.

See what power did in one particular zone, which I'm still prepared to call the moral sensibility of ministers. Not only have their arteries hardened and their consciences grown dull. That's to be expected under the weight of office. More startling is how easily the gates of perception, their sense of what they are doing, have been closed and locked. </p> <p>When they came to power, one principle they seemed unbreakably attached to was a detestation of racial prejudice. Equality of racial justice and hostility to ethnic discrimination were ideals that united old and new Labour. To men like Tony Blair and Jack Straw they were articles of faith, which lay behind both the swift abolition of the Tories' primary-purpose rule challenging migrant spouses to prove they had any right to join their partners, and the later setting up of the Stephen Lawrence inquiry. To Blair and Straw it is unimaginable that they could be party to anything but the most impeccable correctness in all matters that touch on race. </p> <p>Yet they have been. Two weeks ago, I wrote about the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000, which outlawed ethnic discrimination by public authorities but made an exception for the immigration service. I unearthed a ministerial order which authorised immigration officers to treat people of certain nationalities - unspecified, but to be identified at the future decision of ministers and officials - worse than other people. Replying to the critique, Straw pleaded a mere drafting technicality and termed my attack \"bizarre\". </p> <p>But this order was only a beginning. There has now been a second one, dated April 23, which extends the reach from nationalities to what it describes, in its own headline, as \"discrimination on ground of ethnic or national origin\". This time the ethnics in question are listed: \"a) Kurd, b) Roma, c) Albanian, d) Tamil, e) Pontic Greek, f) Somali, g) Afghan\". All persons of these origins are now to be subject \"to a more rigorous examination than other persons in the same circumstances\". They can be detained, questioned and rejected, as a class, more freely than other people because they are now deemed prima facie more likely to be illegal immigrants or bogus asylum-seekers. </p> <p>They have something else in common, however. There is no Kurdish passport, there is no Roma passport. Identifying these people can be attempted through little more than their personal appearance, plus some inference from the flight or possibly boat they arrive on. So, not only is the bar on collective discrimination being ditched, but a peculiarly vicious form of sorting is written into statute, whereby immigration officers herd together anyone who looks like a Kurd or a Tamil or a Pontic Greek - regardless of whether these come, as Tamils do, from Sri Lanka, Canada, India or even the UK - and impose special oppression on them. </p> <p>Ministers' handling of this law went through two phases. The first, during passage, was to pretend it was benign. The only purpose they cited was to make it easier to discriminate in favour of, say, Kosovan refugees. When pressed by Liberal Democrats such as Lord Lester, that was the scenario they repeatedly mentioned. They were lying. It is quite apparent from the April 23 order that what they wanted all along was the power to authorise state-sponsored mass exclusion of certain ethnic groups, without regard for individual justice, on a scale never before seen in this country. </p> <p> Phase two came last week. The new law, said Barbara Roche, Straw's minion in charge of immigration, was merely giving formal shape to a practice that had been going on a long time. She was almost flippant in her incredulity that anyone should complain about a long-established pattern of ethnic selection. She talked about the need for \"objective evidence\" against each migrant. But no one has explained how a Roma is meant to overcome the ethnic evidence against him, especially in view of the further sub-clause in the order which states, almost incredibly: \"If the information [needed to pursue an application to enter] is not available in a language which the person understands, it is not necessary to provide the information in a language which he does understand.\" </p> <p>Three conclusions can be drawn from this. First, whether or not ethnic selection went on before, it has now been systematised. If an apparent Kurd, or potential Roma, or notional Pontic Greek has by some oversight not been discriminated against, ministers may want to know the reason why. Immigration controllers are now on formal notice as to which ethnic and national origins are especially unwelcome in Britain. Their conduct will be policed by someone called a \"race monitor\", but only retrospectively and without attention to individual cases. The monitor is plainly a PR stooge in the making. </p> <p>Second, as the government's contribution to present discontents over asylum, this is political cowardice on a grand scale. No one disputes the need for immigration control. But faced by the mighty force of Ann Widdecombe, Blair and Straw are evidently terrified of electoral punishment if they can't match her rhetoric of national alarm with measures of ethnic hostility. Though all these politicians avow their respect for genuine cases, it's the tritest lip service. Straw collaborates with Widdecombe in a discourse from which only the Lib Dems stand aside, that stigmatises asylum itself as presumptively a bogus concept, eating away at the resources of the fifth largest economy in the world. </p> <p>Third, something unpleasant has happened to Labour in power. For all sorts of reasons, they need to win the election. I hope they do. They're the only plausible choice on offer and defend several important policies that will probably, given time, make this country a better place. But their immigration regime shows not only that they've become, in a vital area, as bad as the Tories, but that they have lost their intellectual as well as moral faculties. They appear not to know what they're doing. They sincerely believe they do not favour ethnic discrimination. Straw, the posturing anti-racist, thinks any challenge to his law can only be \"bizarre\". He is surrounded by a party that seems to believe the same - barely a squeak came out of it when the law went through. </p> <p>Such, it seems, is today's corruption of power: not so much a conspiracy of self-interest as the building of a wall of righteous self-belief. A power-driven certainty that, because one is who one is, one can by definition do no wrong. This law of ethnic punishment is a disgrace. Perhaps only a party infused by belief in its own anti-racism would have the nerve to smuggle it past the frontier that separates a decent country from a shameful one.</p>",

      "body": "<p>There was no real reason to suppose that the sensational 1997 election result would create a sensational parliament. Yes, almost one third of the people who voted Tory five years earlier failed to do so this time. Yes, the number of Tory MPs was halved. Yes, if Labour had won just 20 seats more, they would have held an incredible two-thirds of all parliamentary seats. But it would have been foolish to imagine that from the astonishing avalanche of new members, an excitingly free, independent and thoughtful parliament would emerge.</p> <p>On the contrary, if some parliaments win sobriquets - the long parliament, the rump parliament, etc - then this one could be called the poodle parliament.</p> <p>To be fair, the growth of lickspittle questioning had begun long before Labour surged into power, and had been heartily encouraged by John Major. Beset by rebellious and rebarbative backbenchers, he had often been willing to give government posts to those who offered the most fulsome support and hence the most welcome respite in the House of Commons. But any hopes that Labour would run things differently were quickly dashed.</p> <p>At the beginning of each day's session MPs who had questions tabled - plus any others who were anxious to make life easier for their superiors - were issued with long and detailed \"fact\" sheets. These listed all the questions in order, provided ripostes to likely Conservative claims, and suggested \"helpful\" supplementaries by which backbenchers with an eye to their own future could offer supportive remarks to ministers in the guise of probing questions. Question time was, less than ever, a chance for MPs to grill the executive on behalf of their constituents. Instead it became a parade of formalised, party-political combat.</p> <p>Sometimes even this ritual process went dreadfully wrong. During one prime minister's question time in November 2000, the whips issued the same grovelling supplementary to two Labour MPs. When one of them, Caroline Flint, rose to speak she stuttered that she couldn't put a question because someone had already asked it. This was one of the low spots of the entire parliament.</p> <p>Andrew Mackinlay, however, the tough, outspoken MP for Thurrock, won plaudits from all sides when he protested about obsequious questions and declared how disappointed he had been to see the practice continue. Another Labour rebel, the wealthy QC Robert Marshall-Andrews, lost any hopes he had of a ministerial job when, speaking at a dinner for the Society of Labour Lawyers, he made a joke at the expense of Derry Irvine, soon to become Lord Chancellor. He later instituted the Golden Pager Award, to be given annually to the MP who asked the greasiest question of the year.</p> <p>It seemed a fitting memorial to the whole parliament. The problem was not eased by the Tories, perhaps the most ineffective opposition anyone can recall. In part this was due to their small numbers; the average government generally has 90-plus members, including whips and members of the Lords. Nearly all of these must be shadowed by the opposition, and with only 165 MPs to draw from, the new Tory leader William Hague was obliged to give front-bench positions to around half of his members.</p> <p>You can't do this without a loss of quality, a loss exacerbated by his decision to clear out as many former ministers as he could. Not only had six cabinet members been defeated in the election, but many who had survived - including disappointed leadership candidates such as Michael Heseltine and Ken Clarke - decided that the time had come to retreat to the backbenches and their various directorships. On top of this, Hague fired heavy-hitters such as Michael Howard, Peter Lilley and John Redwood.</p> <p>The widely liked and respected Sir George Young left the shadow cabinet to stand unsuccessfully for Speaker. The return of Michael Portillo, swiftly offered the key post of shadow chancellor, gave Mr Hague some relief, but the fact remained that for much of the parliament, apart from himself, only one other member of the shadow cabinet had been in a real cabinet.</p> <p>The consequence was that a largely successful minister such as David Blunkett was shadowed by the inexperienced Theresa May, and feebler operators such as Stephen Byers, Chris Smith and John Prescott were matched against lightweights such as Angela Browning, Peter Ainsworth and Archie Norman. None of these managed to land many punches on those in power. Often the House had to wait for contributions from the likes of Heseltine, Clarke, Major, Redwood and John Selwyn Gummer - all backbenchers now - if members wanted to hear a coherent, informed and well argued attack on the government.</p> <p>There are many causes for the apparent decline. The Labour government has barely hidden its contempt for parliament, which it regards largely as a rubber-stamping mechanism. This is especially apparent when it comes to highly controversial measures such as the reduction in trial by jury and the part-privatisation of air traffic control, all privately opposed by a majority of Labour MPs. The national debate has tended to shift further and further into the media and away from the Commons, where rules of procedure can mean that important events may not be debated for weeks. With the growth of round-the-clock news coverage, MPs frequently prefer to be interviewed live on air than wait in the hopes of being called to give their opinions to a largely empty chamber.</p> <p>The new Speaker, Michael Martin, replaced the exceedingly popular Betty Boothroyd in October 2000. While some feel he has been unjustly criticised for his lacklustre control of the House, few believe that he matches his predecessor either in public esteem or parliamentary skills. There were some highlights, however. The best debate of the year was probably the first on fox hunting, held at the tailend of 1997.

      "bodyText": "There was no real reason to suppose that the sensational 1997 election result would create a sensational parliament. Yes, almost one third of the people who voted Tory five years earlier failed to do so this time. Yes, the number of Tory MPs was halved. Yes, if Labour had won just 20 seats more, they would have held an incredible two-thirds of all parliamentary seats. But it would have been foolish to imagine that from the astonishing avalanche of new members, an excitingly free, independent and thoughtful parliament would emerge. On the contrary, if some parliaments win sobriquets - the long parliament, the rump parliament, etc - then this one could be called the poodle parliament. To be fair, the growth of lickspittle questioning had begun long before Labour surged into power, and had been heartily encouraged by John Major. Beset by rebellious and rebarbative backbenchers, he had often been willing to give government posts to those who offered the most fulsome support and hence the most welcome respite in the House of Commons. But any hopes that Labour would run things differently were quickly dashed. At the beginning of each day's session MPs who had questions tabled - plus any others who were anxious to make life easier for their superiors - were issued with long and detailed \"fact\" sheets. These listed all the questions in order, provided ripostes to likely Conservative claims, and suggested \"helpful\" supplementaries by which backbenchers with an eye to their own future could offer supportive remarks to ministers in the guise of probing questions. Question time was, less than ever, a chance for MPs to grill the executive on behalf of their constituents. Instead it became a parade of formalised, party-political combat. Sometimes even this ritual process went dreadfully wrong. During one prime minister's question time in November 2000, the whips issued the same grovelling supplementary to two Labour MPs. When one of them, Caroline Flint, rose to speak she stuttered that she couldn't put a question because someone had already asked it. This was one of the low spots of the entire parliament. Andrew Mackinlay, however, the tough, outspoken MP for Thurrock, won plaudits from all sides when he protested about obsequious questions and declared how disappointed he had been to see the practice continue. Another Labour rebel, the wealthy QC Robert Marshall-Andrews, lost any hopes he had of a ministerial job when, speaking at a dinner for the Society of Labour Lawyers, he made a joke at the expense of Derry Irvine, soon to become Lord Chancellor. He later instituted the Golden Pager Award, to be given annually to the MP who asked the greasiest question of the year. It seemed a fitting memorial to the whole parliament. The problem was not eased by the Tories, perhaps the most ineffective opposition anyone can recall. In part this was due to their small numbers; the average government generally has 90-plus members, including whips and members of the Lords. Nearly all of these must be shadowed by the opposition, and with only 165 MPs to draw from, the new Tory leader William Hague was obliged to give front-bench positions to around half of his members. You can't do this without a loss of quality, a loss exacerbated by his decision to clear out as many former ministers as he could. Not only had six cabinet members been defeated in the election, but many who had survived - including disappointed leadership candidates such as Michael Heseltine and Ken Clarke - decided that the time had come to retreat to the backbenches and their various directorships. On top of this, Hague fired heavy-hitters such as Michael Howard, Peter Lilley and John Redwood. The widely liked and respected Sir George Young left the shadow cabinet to stand unsuccessfully for Speaker. The return of Michael Portillo, swiftly offered the key post of shadow chancellor, gave Mr Hague some relief, but the fact remained that for much of the parliament, apart from himself, only one other member of the shadow cabinet had been in a real cabinet. The consequence was that a largely successful minister such as David Blunkett was shadowed by the inexperienced Theresa May, and feebler operators such as Stephen Byers, Chris Smith and John Prescott were matched against lightweights such as Angela Browning, Peter Ainsworth and Archie Norman. None of these managed to land many punches on those in power. Often the House had to wait for contributions from the likes of Heseltine, Clarke, Major, Redwood and John Selwyn Gummer - all backbenchers now - if members wanted to hear a coherent, informed and well argued attack on the government. There are many causes for the apparent decline. The Labour government has barely hidden its contempt for parliament, which it regards largely as a rubber-stamping mechanism. This is especially apparent when it comes to highly controversial measures such as the reduction in trial by jury and the part-privatisation of air traffic control, all privately opposed by a majority of Labour MPs. The national debate has tended to shift further and further into the media and away from the Commons, where rules of procedure can mean that important events may not be debated for weeks. With the growth of round-the-clock news coverage, MPs frequently prefer to be interviewed live on air than wait in the hopes of being called to give their opinions to a largely empty chamber. The new Speaker, Michael Martin, replaced the exceedingly popular Betty Boothroyd in October 2000. While some feel he has been unjustly criticised for his lacklustre control of the House, few believe that he matches his predecessor either in public esteem or parliamentary skills. There were some highlights, however. The best debate of the year was probably the first on fox hunting, held at the tailend of 1997. That featured what some regard as the finest speech of the parliament: a passionate, ferocious, enraged diatribe against hunting from Ann Widdecombe, the acknowledged star of the Tory front bench. It also included what might be the best joke of the parliament. Michael Heseltine was speaking, rather pompously it must be said, about methods of killing foxes. \"Why do we flush something out?\" he asked rhetorically. \"Ask Mrs Thatcher!\" shouted Denis MacShane, Labour MP for Rotherham. The gale of laughter that followed provided one of those rare parliamentary moments when a single interjection can destroy an entire speech. \u0095 Simon Hoggart is the Guardian's parliamentary sketchwriter.

      "bodyText": "President George Bush is preparing today to launch the biggest military rethink and most costly weapons refit in modern American history. The sweeping changes, which are being proposed to the president by Donald Rumsfeld, the defence secretary, are based on the closely guarded conclusions of an in-house Pentagon strategy panel whose proposals are expected to add tens of billions of dollars of extra spending every year to the already massive US defence budget. Today's meeting will also mark a major change in military priorities as Washington shifts its sights from Europe to Asia and from spending on the army to spending on the navy, the air force and on hi-tech weaponry including missile defences. Although figures have not yet been given publicly, the Bush administration is gearing up to add a further $8bn to this year's $206bn spending, an extra $20bn billion to the already published 2002 budget total of $310.5bn and, most radical of all, an unspecified but major increase in spending in 2003 and beyond. The plans are an attempt to carry out one of Mr Bush's main election campaign pledges, that he would give the Pentagon the opportunity to \"skip a generation\" in military technology. The strategic heart of the new approach is understood to be the abandonment of the long-standing US military doctrine in which defence spending and deployments are predicated on the need to fight two major wars in different parts of the globe simultaneously. The new approach is built on the doctrine that the US must have the military capability to act any time, anywhere, in defence of what it sees as its global interests. The emphasis will continue to shift from soldiers to technology and could lead to large-scale military layoffs, especially from the army. The change of defence strategy will affect all the armed services and will have major implications for US allies, including Britain. The shift from Europe, which dominated US strategic planning during the cold war, means a diminishing role for the army, which played the central role in strategy against Moscow. The new focus on east Asia, with China cast in the role of America's principal regional adversary, entails a bigger role for the navy and the air force in delivering US military strike power. Today's White House meeting will be the first step along a road which will lead to one of the defining domestic events of Mr Bush's presidency, the battle over the 2003 federal budget, in which the administration will lay out the full multi-billion dollar price tag for its missile defence plans. It is by no means clear how the Bush administration intends to pay for its ambitious plans, especially as it has just pressed Congress to pass a huge tax cutting programme. Any economic downturn in the US would also be likely to increase the pressure on departmental budgets. Today's meeting also fires the starting gun on what Washington insiders expect will be a brutal internal struggle for ascendancy between the rival armed services, all of which fear that they have been cut out of the top-secret strategy review process initiated by Mr Rumsfeld when he was appointed to head the Pentagon in January. Assuming Mr Bush gives his approval to the plans today, the Pentagon will unveil its new strategy in public next week. This will be followed by a keynote defence speech which President Bush is due to deliver at the Annapolis naval college on May 25 and which will lay out \"the vision of where we need to go as we move into the 21st century\".

      "bodyText": "Lastminute.com, the online retailer that floated at the height of the dot.com boom, has stunned its critics with the news that profitability is just around the corner. The company founded by new media upstarts Martha Lane Fox and Brent Hoberman said its UK and French businesses would be in the black within 12 months. Lastminute, which sells unsold hotel, airline and holiday packages to customers at discounted prices, has \u00a362m in the bank, more than enough to see it through to next year. \"Our strong brand, the impact of the roll-out of our new technology platform and prudent cash and cost management all mean that lastminute.com remains well-placed to be a lead player in the European e-commerce market place,\" said Mr Hoberman, the chief executive of the company. Much of the credit for Lastminute's recovery will go to the chairman, Allan Leighton, the former European head of US retail giant WalMart who was drafted in last year to inject some off-line savvy into the firm. He has cut costs at the company which was spending its flotation proceeds at an alarming rate. In a clear indication of his influence, the Lastminute's cash burn rate over the last three months fell by 20% to \u00a39.1m. The company rose to fame in March 2000 when it floated at a staggering 555p per share, but it quickly became notorious when the stock plunged to a low of 35p. This morning, the shares fell nearly 5% to 57.5p. Today's announcement was made alongside lastminute's second quarter results, which recorded a lower pre-tax loss of \u00a310.6m and a 39% rise in gross profits to \u00a33.9m. Other signs of improving health at the company included a rise in the number of site visitors who become buyers, which climbed from 9% to 11% between January and March this year. The much-debated acquisition of French rival Degriftour for \u00a359m last summer also appears to have paid off, giving lastminute access to a lucrative market.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>Derek Malcolm:</strong> John, you realise you've ruined this island - in the next few years there'll be nothing but hotels and tourists.</p> <p><strong>John Madden:</strong> They've got their priorities right on the island. They've refused to build any hotels on the beaches we shot on up until now and I'm sure they'll do the same after the film's been released. At the same time there are plenty of people on the island who are desperate for an economic boost</p> <p><strong>DM:</strong> It's a pretty poor island, and not a tourist island really.</p> <p><strong>JM:</strong> No. It's way down the league table. </p> <p><strong>DM</strong> But it won't be anymore, will it?</p> <p><strong>JM:</strong> Well, it's a complicated business really. There'll be many people on the island who'll be absolutely delighted - they're already delighted, I think, with the attention they've got from the book. From our point of view it's a mixed blessing, but it's not up to me to decide. It's up to them</p> <p><strong>DM:</strong> Are there lots of tourist places there?</p> <p><strong>JM:</strong> No. There's a strip on the southern side of the island which is pretty well developed for tourism, but most of the rest of the island is not, and any kind of stampede that might or might not be generated in that direction will be limited by the amount of accommodation that's available.</p> <p><strong>DM:</strong> You came into this film quite late - Roger Michell was originally going to direct it, but unfortunately suffered a heart attack</p> <p><strong>JM:</strong> From which he's recovered, I hasten to add. And he's made another film since.</p> <p><strong>DM:</strong> At what stage did you get involved?</p> <p><strong>JM:</strong> Well, Roger had just completed Notting Hill and was resuming work on a script that had been in development by Shawn and Kevin Loader, the producer, after about a year's hiatus, I think I'm right in saying, then fell ill. At that point, the medical advice he was given was that he should think very carefully about whether or not he should proceed with this. Roger is somebody I know, and he and Kevin and Working Title approached me saying that should Roger not be able to proceed, would it be something I would be willing to think about?</p> <p><strong>DM:</strong> Had you read Captain Corelli's Mandolin?</p> <p>JM: I had not read the book, no. I read the script first and was enormously beguiled, but I didn't think it worked as a film. Then I read the book and I read the book again and I said, 'Alright. I'm absolutely on for this, but I have to go back and start from scratch.</p> <p><strong>DM:</strong> Had it already been cast?</p> <p><strong>JM:</strong> No, it hadn't. Nicolas Cage was committed to the project which, since I'm sure I'm amongst a group of people who are aware of how these things work, had made the film a 'Go' project - meaning that they people were prepared to commit to vastly less than the film was going to cost, which is how these things work. So it was a Go project in that sense, but Nick was the only element that was committed, and he was committed to the project, though not necessarily the script at that point.</p> <p><strong>DM:</strong> And you had to rewrite the script for this man, Shawn?</p> <p><strong>Shawn Slovo:</strong> Well, any director who comes on will have his own take on how he sees the film. I think it's a miracle I survived the transition, really, given the number of credits you see on films. I had a lot of support from John and the producers, so I saw it through from beginning to end.</p> <p><strong>DM:</strong> How did you originally write the script? Were you given an offer to write it, or did you just write it yourself?</p> <p><strong>SS:</strong> No. Kevin Loader optioned the book together with Roger Michell and together they took it to Working Title, who agreed to finance the development. Working Title brought me onboard because I have a long-standing relationship with them.</p> <p><strong>DM:</strong> After A World Apart?</p> <p><strong>SS:</strong> Yes. The first film I made, and the only other film I've had made, was with Working Title way back in their early days.</p> <p><strong>DM:</strong> There's been some argument about the changes made from book to film. Are you happy with those changes? Are you both happy with the ending, because it's very different from the book? Why did you change the ending?</p> <p><strong>JM:</strong> I have to take responsibility for this. This is part of a much larger argument which I'm happy to discuss. You take on any kind of a book and you have to consider it from a cinematic perspective. You have to consider why you were attracted to it in terms of what it's saying, what its world is, what its characters are and what its themes are. Then you have to examine the narrative means that are already in place in the novel. </p> <p>It was never, for its manifold virtues and extraordinary qualities, a narrative that could be replicated on screen. In simple terms, and I can talk about it completely mechanically, I felt it was a matter of analysing - and I would stress before I say this that it is a book that invites an extraordinary range of interpretations of its major themes, love, waste, war, survival, continuity, political factionalism - the end of the book, which was not achievable cinematically. The artifice that would have been needed to realise it - the layers of prosthetic make up needed to age the actors - would explode people out of the film in a way that I think would not have been helpful. Never mind the editorial and grammatical effort involved in jumping from the climax in the film to a time that distant.</p> <p>To me it was more a matter of taking the elements involved, which meant analysing Corelli's departure from the island and then his return and how that would play out for the characters in that situation. Whatever perspective it's now viewed from, I can argue quite happily about why I came to the conclusions that I did. There was never in my mind any sense that I was doing a disservice to the book by changing that ending, nor do I think that Louis thinks that either.</p> <p><strong>DM:</strong> Do you think that there was one theme when you wrote the script that was more important to you than others? Did you think it was a love story?</p> <p><strong>SS:</strong> I think that's what I was most interested in, and that is the hook. The relationship between those two characters takes you through the film. As anyone who has read the book will know, there is so much more, there's such a myriad of characters to follow, but you only have two hours of film. </p> <p><strong>DM:</strong> You have to simplify it in some way. And I don't mean that rudely.</p> <p><strong>SS:</strong> Well, yes. We try to get the Carlo story working as well, which is one of the strongest elements in the book. Carlo has a homosexual love longing with Corelli. The time spent on that took away from the main story, so we kind of lost that in the process.</p> <p><strong>DM:</strong> What about the political aspect of the book? He was very rude about the Greek communists, wasn't he? That wasn't in the film, was it?</p> <p><strong>SS:</strong> Well we haven't negated it. It's true that there were atrocities on all sides, including the Greek partisan sides, during that struggle. I think that when you see the girl hanging that that is an indication. When you're doing something that is about the Second World War, about the extent of the German massacre on the island, the Germans are the villains of the piece, really. I think that also it is historically accurate that the partisans were allied with the Italians in the fight against the Germans, so that's something we've brought to the fore.</p> <p><strong>DM:</strong> And the character of her lover, hasn't that been changed from the book?</p> <p><strong>SS:</strong> Mandras? Well I think he was quite a victim. He started off as a simple fisherman who goes to war and is brutalised by the war.</p> <p><strong>JM:</strong> Hangs out with the communists and becomes corrupted</p> <p>SS: He returns and attempts to rape Pelagia. There was an attempt to give him more of a journey and more dignity. I always felt that the stronger the relationship between him and Pelagia, the stronger that would make the relationship between Corelli and Pelagia.</p> <p>DM: Have you had any criticism politically from Italians or the Greeks, or is it too early to say?</p> <p>JM: Well the film hasn't really opened there yet. It's no secret that the partisan issue is one of immense political sensitivity in Greece, the book of course has run into great controversy. In papers here, this was assumed to be an enormous obstacle in the making of the film. It was suggested that there was great resentment and hostility, and I can vouch that there was. It is a complicated and difficult issue. </p> <p>I think it is assumed that we have taken a line in the film that has avoided those issues. I think I'm the best person to argue for that, because the transformation of the Mandras character was essentially a development that I brought to the film, which had no political motivation I have to say, but a dramatic motivation. I don't think that a film could take on the complexities of those arguments and still function. </p> <p>The book has an astonishing amplitude and range of reference; it is very digressive and jumps across locales. It spends time with Mandras and Hector and so forth in the ideological indoctrination and the beginnings of factionalism that led to the Greek civil war. In film terms, you simply have to create a hierarchy - what is the story? That would never have been in the brief of the film. Mandras' character and development had more to do with the way that character functions in the central story. </p> <p>The book presents you with certain challenges when trying to present a film story because the characters are strangely disconnected from one another's lives and experiences in the book. For example, Mandras and Corelli never meet in the book at all. The relationship Pelagia has with Mandras is over before Corelli arrives. The relationship with Corelli, the atrocities and the departure from the island is all over before Mandras returns. In simple dramatic terms, that seemed to me to be a lost opportunity. Not that that's a problem in the book, but in terms of examining that in the film, making every character's relationship to the central characters something organic, that was the idea at work.</p> <p>The Carlo situation is a similar one. Creating that hierarchy is a disappointing one in some ways because you're desperate to produce the richness of the book in the film as far as you can, and I struggled - I would like to say heroically - with Shawn, in order to bring that into the story, but in the end all we were doing was tokenising the story. We decided on a more radical inversion of that character that allowed him to work cinematically in a slightly different way.</p> <p>At the same time you are creating a piece that you hope stands alongside the book, independently of the book - because there'll be many people who will see the film who haven't read the book and I hope will then go to the book - but you will never do anyone a service by simply treading in the footsteps of the book.</p> <p>DM: You did as far as locations are concerned. Most films aren't shot on location, was it easy to choose the right location?</p> <p>JM: It was very hot and logistically seemed suicidal in many ways. Not so much of the money ends up onscreen theoretically because the reality is that it is an island and there is no infrastructure for making a film. You have to bring all the crew in from elsewhere in Greece. Obviously vast numbers of the construction crew were on the island, as you can see from the number of family names that crop up in the credits. Nevertheless, the majority of the crew has to be brought there and housed and everything else. Every single element of the production design was imported because every building was flattened by the earthquake of 1953, and destroyed everything pre-1953. </p> <p>DM: Absolutely everything?</p> <p>JM: Well, the only real house in it, oddly enough, is the scene that takes place at the beginning of the film where the pea is extracted from Stamatis's ear, that one building exists but everything else you see is built. In industry terms it made no sense, but in every other way, and ultimately in industry terms, it made a lot of sense. The film was very economic to make, but more significantly there was a quality about the island and the light and most significantly a quality about the people and the experiences that they'd had that was an invaluable resource for the film and kept us honest in a way. </p> <p>We were able to create, in a film grammar now of such sophistication it doesn't seem to be necessary, but we were able to connect one place to another on the island. You could see the village from the doctor's house, you could relate the beach that we'd decided to locate the Italian encampment on and so on. Some smell and dust and so forth of the actual experience that makes up the experience of that island, not to mention the cicadas, translates into the film and can't be eradicated from the film, even with modern technology - that was amazing.</p> <p>Particularly for me, when I went to the island and at the point I came onto the film, the island was a possibility for the film, Corfu was another favoured possibility, I was overwhelmed by the visual iconography of the place. By which I mean the rubble of the destruction, the routine destruction in historical terms of that island, is everywhere evident. They simply move down the hill and build the village again. They don't really bother to remove the rubble or indeed they build the house on top of the rubble of the one just destroyed. Something about that sense resonated incredibly for me with the themes of the book that I responded to that were to do with healing and regeneration and continuity and survival. My first instinct was how are we going to do this? We would have to hide the earthquake because it doesn't happen in the book and it wasn't in the script that I originally received. Then I felt that actually the opposite was true and it was a visual metaphor that was available all the time and crucial to the whole experience and meaning of the film. </p> <p>DM: Were you there during the shoot, Shawn? Did you feel like you wanted to change some things when you got there?</p> <p>SS: I think I was there because John came on so late</p> <p>JM: I'd have had you there anyway</p> <p>SS: Soon you'll have no choice - you'll have me on the call sheet and the clapperboard. Because John came in so late there was stuff that was unfinished. Because there was so much going on for him we couldn't actually focus until the end. Things kept changing</p> <p>JM: Yes, we kept working on it right until the end of the film.</p> <p>SS: It was a very dynamic process, it was very exciting.</p> <p>DM: It's not very often you can do that as a writer.</p> <p>SS: I don't think so, no.</p> <p>JM: That's why she was the only writer. I don't think I could have had ten of them there</p> <p>DM: Do you think it would ever be possible to make that sort of film with Italians playing Italians, Greeks playing Greeks and so on?</p> <p>JM: I think in all honesty, no. No. I would love it to be possible but I think the resources to realise a film of this size would prohibit it. I was not involved in the financing process of it, but as I referred to earlier, I'm not saying it was a prerequisite that we had an American actor. We might have had an Australian actor, guess who, we might have had an English actor, guess who, we might have had an Irish actor</p> <p>DM: Well, who?</p> <p>JM: Whether we could have had an Italian actorcertainly if I'd had been in at that part of the game and I had looked there and had found that actor I would not have hesitated to fight for that tooth and nail. Do I, in the reality of my own experience, think that that would have been possible without some counterbalance somewhere else, I don't think so. </p> <p>You make movies these days within a contextual reality. You shouldn't really attempt this sort of movie given the kind of resources it commands without to some extent absorbing that reality and accepting that reality. </p> <p>DM: The reality is that you have to sell in the American market? I'm not criticising</p> <p>JM: I don't take it as a criticism. You're stating a fact. I think that is probably true in terms of the first equation that has to be made. Take, for example, Enemy at the Gate, which is entirely European financed and does not have an American headlining star. It has two or three big English names and was made through a consortium and cost considerably more than this</p> <p>DM: The most expensive European film ever, I believe.</p> <p>JM: Indeed. This is a great development in the British movie industry that Jude Law, Rachel Weisz and Jo Fiennes are considered to be of a magnitude in the world market that justifies that kind of investment. Whether or not a relatively unknown Italian actor and Greek actress, who again we certainly would have cast - Viki Maragaki who plays Eleni was an actress who Roger Michell was looking at and certainly I was too - even with a European consortium could have sold the film, I very much doubt.</p> <p>DM: Is it not possible for a film to be successful in Europe and elsewhere without an American star for the American market?</p> <p> JM: No, I didn't say that. I don't think that the film would ever have been paid for. I think that that's the crucial issue, not whether it would have been successful. Unfortunately it's hard to get to the point where you can make that argument. But it has to do with the scale and ambition of the movie you're making. Wonderful movies are made that cost infinitely less than that. If you know you're going to take on this sort of story you know that it has a certain kind of scale and that's something you choose to accept or you don't. At the point that that particular choice presented itself to me, I made a decision, which is why I'm here.</p> <p>DM: Well, you've made three pretty successful decisions up to now. Do you think this is luck or good management?</p> <p>JM: Very kind of you to say so! </p> <p>DM: Well, I think this will make its money back, if nothing else.</p> <p>JM: Please quote that! We're going to put it on the posters tomorrow! I think the answer to your question is that luck is never far away. It's a very odd business.</p> <p>DM: You must have been very surprised, for instance, with Mrs Brown.</p> <p>JM: Well, yes. Incredibly surprised. All I ever think about is is this movie something I can muster my belief in sufficiently to carry everyone with you that you need to make the film? Will it work on its own terms? I don't think about the larger landscape, including this film, until now. It's very hard to know what contributes to it. I didn't know how Mrs Brown would turn out, though I certainly hoped that the film would end up in the cinema as it did. I had no expectation of where Shakespeare In Love would end up, I imagined it might work for a small coterie of people that had the same interest that I had. Likewise this. You just get on and make the film. You don't think about the rest of it.</p> <p>DM: And there's a lot of bad luck too. A World Apart was a very good film and never really did the business that was hoped.</p> <p>SS: That proves the importance of distribution, that's what it proves. The American backers went bankrupt so there were, I think, sixteen prints in the whole of America. It doesn't matter how good the film is if not enough people can get to see it. Thank you for that.</p> <p>DM: I'm sure there's some questions.</p> <p>Q1: Could you explain the process by which you wrote the script? Did Shawn write it and then John made his comments? To what extent was it working together and how did that change during the shoot?</p> <p>SS: It was a truly collaborative process, which is, I think, the best you can hope for in screenwriting - to be working with the director. We worked intensely together. We had long discussions in John's kitchen with Irena Brignall who was the story editor, brought in to speed up the process. John and Irena, because we had so little time, would plot ahead. John was also working out the film in his mind to make it his. I would go away and write, present the pages and then get brought up to speed, then go away and write. I wasn't dictated to, I have to say. That was the process.</p> <p>JM: It was very intense and very compressed because I originally assumed that the timetable of the film was very flexible, but Nicholas Cage had a John Woo picture to do and all we could do in the end was move their picture back a couple of weeks and frontload the schedule, so that most of Nick's work was done at the beginning. We had five months from when I came on board to assemble the film and rewrite it from scratch, which was an educational and thrilling process.</p> <p>The normal process of writing a script is normally a discussion followed by a complete draft from a writer which you then turn over and discuss and then the writer comes up with another draft. That wasn't possible in this case.</p> <p>SS: That was the way I worked with Roger, but we had four years.</p> <p>JM: And no deadline. Then suddenly we had a deadline and nothing else! It's not to say that Roger's script might not have gone on to develop in another way. It's got nothing to do with ego, but as a director you have to commit to and be accountable for every single decision and moment in the film because they'll be thousands of decisions that rest on that one choice. So you've got to know where you are and believe in it. It's a massive book and you have to say, 'This is my way through this book'. </p> <p>The process of working on it was a weird one because you'd get so far and then before you could ratify that you had to go back and make other changes, so we really didn't ever get as far as a first draft of the script until about a month before we were due to go there. That's when Louis came into the equation. At my behest we left certain parts of the film in what I would call a holding pattern, they were stacked up and waiting to land. As the identity of the film began to emerge in the shooting process, certain ideas started to slot into place about the form the script should take. That went on for the whole period we were shooting.</p> <p>Q: With regard to the finance, is it possible to open up to small investors, like a sort of stock market?</p> <p>JM: An extraordinary amount of imagination is used now in the financing of movies. As regards to the financing of this movie, many of those elements were already in place. I don't know if I'm the best person to speak about that at this juncture, but that certainly is a way of going, but it's extraordinarily difficult. The huge struggle for many movies is to put the finance in place and for everybody to lock and agree that the financing is there. Almost always that financing is based on elements that are involved in the film that give the investors some guarantee of visibility, some sense that the movie can open because of the interest generated by the elements involved and those are things you don't know in advance.</p> <p>The more expensive the film, the more difficult it becomes.</p> <p>DM: Is it getting easier or more difficult to write an intelligent script? How easy is it to get it through?</p> <p>SS: You mean to get an intelligent script made? I think that there is a dumbing down at every single level because films are so expensive people are unwilling to take risks. Independent film-making is not what it was and theatres are closing all over the country here, independent theatres.</p> <p>DM: But audiences are increasing, but for the same old films.</p> <p>SS: It's youth that goes to the cinema, and they seem quite happy with what they get. For older people it's getting harder and harder to find something interesting to see at the cinema.</p> <p>JM: Those kind of films do get through, but they're the ones that come from behind and buck the system. I think in mainstream movie-making your question is a valid one. I think that even if a script does break through, certain pressures are brought to bear on it that threaten the degree of new territory it's carving out.</p> <p>Q: How did Nicolas Cage become involved and what influence did he have on how the film was made?</p> <p>JM: The answer is he became involved because he was enormously attracted to the material. He did the movie for a fraction of his normal price - still expensive, but not punitively expensive. He is an actor who I would fly the flag for whether he was in my film or not because he is an actor who is hungry and curious and to some extent swims in the mainstream precisely because it gives him the opportunity to swim up the tributaries now and then. The film for which he is most applauded for is a film nobody in the mainstream would have made, Leaving Las Vegas. He is attracted to areas he has not explored as an actor before, and that is to be applauded in a business where you are encouraged to stay exactly where you are. </p> <p>Also, he had never made a film outside of America. I'm not sure he'd left California, God bless him. </p> <p>SS: He experienced jetlag!</p> <p>JM: That's why he took it on. The only way in which he affected production where circumstances not really under his control which had to do with deadlines. He is a consummate professional. A man without any grandeur on the set. He comes, like any actor, you hope, very well prepared having thought incredibly hard about what he's doing, with a suitcase full of nutty ideas. The first rehearsal of any scene was always entertaining, and he's very happy to put those ideas back in the suitcase, and frequently he did. He's completely delightful, serious, professional, imaginative and daring. </p> <p>For an actor who is pretty much at the top of the tree in the system, I love that about him. I think he is a top man and he has been completely supportive of the film and he will go anywhere to support it, within the terms of his own schedule, and good for him.</p> <p>Q: What was it like to work with P\u00e9nelope Cruz?</p> <p>JM: She's an actress in a very peculiar position at the moment. She is a hugely well-respected actress in Spain who has done an enormous range of work. She is somebody who, because of the way she looks and because of the sequence of movies she has made, has got a profile which belies who she really is. This culminated in a scurrilous and disgusting article that appeared, I think, in ES magazine, and whoever wrote it had no right to do so, because she is the most real person imaginable.</p> <p>She is an actress of extraordinary skill and you can compare her to Liv Ulman, who I've also worked with. She has a capacity to reveal herself, simply open herself to the camera, not to indicate anything, not to put a spin on anything. I think she's an extraordinary talent who has a fantastic future. She must now continue to work in her own culture, and she's making a film in Spain as we speak. I think you're only just beginning to see what she's capable of. She can transform herself, in this film, from someone who is eighteen years of age to someone who carries the weight and melancholy of someone who is three times that age. </p> <p>Q: That's a very different P\u00e9nelope Cruz from the P\u00e9nelope Cruz in the magazines.</p> <p>JM: Well, I hope so. Because she is somebody who is happy to have her photograph taken, all kinds of motives are imputed to her, it seems, that are without justification. She was on the island the entire time with her family, eating at the next-door table to us all the time. She is someone who is born to act, I think, she naturally inhabits other personae with an invisible grace and skill, but she's, above all, real. She knows who she is, she knows who her friends are, she knows what life's about, she won't mind if it all goes away, which it won't and I'm astonished at the degree of cynicism there is about that. </p> <p>I'm astonished in one way, and in another I'm not. We all have to work within this system of hype and so forth. She is somebody who has got used to the way the press manipulate her.</p> <p>Q: Can you tell us about the involvement of Louis De Berni\u00e8res?</p> <p>JM: Well Louis was offered the opportunity to adapt the material and write it for a film, but nothing would bore him more, I think. Film writing is a completely inferior process.</p> <p>SS: He says it's lower than being a schoolteacher.</p> <p>JM: He had no interest in that. He had interest only in the fact that the film was made by a British company and in Europe with European sensibilities in mind. That was his concern, and that was fulfilled when Working Title became involved. Aside from reading the draft of the script as it came along, he was very happy to be at arm length. My normal instinct would have been to absolutely rope him into the process, but under the circumstances under which I came into the film, I simply could not do that because of the constraints I was under. There wasn't time. </p> <p>I had to essentially go to him with a first draft of the script which he was alarmed and intrigued by. He came out and joined us on the film for two or three weeks while we were shooting and he had a whale of a time. He didn't really come back into the process until I showed him my first cut of the film and he was, I think, rather thrilled and rather baffled. He is a great friend of Esther Freud who is married to David Morrissey who plays Weber in the film, so I knew he was terrified of seeing it because he was terrified of it being absolutely awful. He was terrified also that it might be rather good. I imagine he found it to be somewhere in-between. I don't know. He was very excited, but still not quite sure. He saw it again a month later and became very pleased with it. He's now seen it six times and he's very happy.</p> <p>I have to say that given the journalistic line about us being unfaithful to the book, he has an absolutely admirable attitude which is that the film and the book must be seen as two different things. As long as I'm committed to the emotional arc of the story, then fine. The book will always be there on the shelves and hopefully many people will go back and read it. He is incredibly funny and loose about it and was as involved as he wanted to be really.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Derek Malcolm: John, you realise you've ruined this island - in the next few years there'll be nothing but hotels and tourists. John Madden: They've got their priorities right on the island. They've refused to build any hotels on the beaches we shot on up until now and I'm sure they'll do the same after the film's been released. At the same time there are plenty of people on the island who are desperate for an economic boost DM: It's a pretty poor island, and not a tourist island really. JM: No. It's way down the league table. DM But it won't be anymore, will it? JM: Well, it's a complicated business really. There'll be many people on the island who'll be absolutely delighted - they're already delighted, I think, with the attention they've got from the book. From our point of view it's a mixed blessing, but it's not up to me to decide. It's up to them DM: Are there lots of tourist places there? JM: No. There's a strip on the southern side of the island which is pretty well developed for tourism, but most of the rest of the island is not, and any kind of stampede that might or might not be generated in that direction will be limited by the amount of accommodation that's available. DM: You came into this film quite late - Roger Michell was originally going to direct it, but unfortunately suffered a heart attack JM: From which he's recovered, I hasten to add. And he's made another film since. DM: At what stage did you get involved? JM: Well, Roger had just completed Notting Hill and was resuming work on a script that had been in development by Shawn and Kevin Loader, the producer, after about a year's hiatus, I think I'm right in saying, then fell ill. At that point, the medical advice he was given was that he should think very carefully about whether or not he should proceed with this. Roger is somebody I know, and he and Kevin and Working Title approached me saying that should Roger not be able to proceed, would it be something I would be willing to think about? DM: Had you read Captain Corelli's Mandolin? JM: I had not read the book, no. I read the script first and was enormously beguiled, but I didn't think it worked as a film. Then I read the book and I read the book again and I said, 'Alright. I'm absolutely on for this, but I have to go back and start from scratch. DM: Had it already been cast? JM: No, it hadn't. Nicolas Cage was committed to the project which, since I'm sure I'm amongst a group of people who are aware of how these things work, had made the film a 'Go' project - meaning that they people were prepared to commit to vastly less than the film was going to cost, which is how these things work. So it was a Go project in that sense, but Nick was the only element that was committed, and he was committed to the project, though not necessarily the script at that point. DM: And you had to rewrite the script for this man, Shawn? Shawn Slovo: Well, any director who comes on will have his own take on how he sees the film. I think it's a miracle I survived the transition, really, given the number of credits you see on films. I had a lot of support from John and the producers, so I saw it through from beginning to end. DM: How did you originally write the script? Were you given an offer to write it, or did you just write it yourself? SS: No. Kevin Loader optioned the book together with Roger Michell and together they took it to Working Title, who agreed to finance the development. Working Title brought me onboard because I have a long-standing relationship with them. DM: After A World Apart? SS: Yes. The first film I made, and the only other film I've had made, was with Working Title way back in their early days. DM: There's been some argument about the changes made from book to film. Are you happy with those changes? Are you both happy with the ending, because it's very different from the book? Why did you change the ending? JM: I have to take responsibility for this. This is part of a much larger argument which I'm happy to discuss. You take on any kind of a book and you have to consider it from a cinematic perspective. You have to consider why you were attracted to it in terms of what it's saying, what its world is, what its characters are and what its themes are. Then you have to examine the narrative means that are already in place in the novel. It was never, for its manifold virtues and extraordinary qualities, a narrative that could be replicated on screen. In simple terms, and I can talk about it completely mechanically, I felt it was a matter of analysing - and I would stress before I say this that it is a book that invites an extraordinary range of interpretations of its major themes, love, waste, war, survival, continuity, political factionalism - the end of the book, which was not achievable cinematically. The artifice that would have been needed to realise it - the layers of prosthetic make up needed to age the actors - would explode people out of the film in a way that I think would not have been helpful. Never mind the editorial and grammatical effort involved in jumping from the climax in the film to a time that distant. To me it was more a matter of taking the elements involved, which meant analysing Corelli's departure from the island and then his return and how that would play out for the characters in that situation. Whatever perspective it's now viewed from, I can argue quite happily about why I came to the conclusions that I did. There was never in my mind any sense that I was doing a disservice to the book by changing that ending, nor do I think that Louis thinks that either. DM: Do you think that there was one theme when you wrote the script that was more important to you than others? Did you think it was a love story? SS: I think that's what I was most interested in, and that is the hook. The relationship between those two characters takes you through the film. As anyone who has read the book will know, there is so much more, there's such a myriad of characters to follow, but you only have two hours of film. DM: You have to simplify it in some way. And I don't mean that rudely. SS: Well, yes. We try to get the Carlo story working as well, which is one of the strongest elements in the book. Carlo has a homosexual love longing with Corelli. The time spent on that took away from the main story, so we kind of lost that in the process. DM: What about the political aspect of the book? He was very rude about the Greek communists, wasn't he? That wasn't in the film, was it? SS: Well we haven't negated it. It's true that there were atrocities on all sides, including the Greek partisan sides, during that struggle. I think that when you see the girl hanging that that is an indication. When you're doing something that is about the Second World War, about the extent of the German massacre on the island, the Germans are the villains of the piece, really. I think that also it is historically accurate that the partisans were allied with the Italians in the fight against the Germans, so that's something we've brought to the fore. DM: And the character of her lover, hasn't that been changed from the book? SS: Mandras? Well I think he was quite a victim. He started off as a simple fisherman who goes to war and is brutalised by the war. JM: Hangs out with the communists and becomes corrupted SS: He returns and attempts to rape Pelagia. There was an attempt to give him more of a journey and more dignity. I always felt that the stronger the relationship between him and Pelagia, the stronger that would make the relationship between Corelli and Pelagia. DM: Have you had any criticism politically from Italians or the Greeks, or is it too early to say? JM: Well the film hasn't really opened there yet. It's no secret that the partisan issue is one of immense political sensitivity in Greece, the book of course has run into great controversy. In papers here, this was assumed to be an enormous obstacle in the making of the film. It was suggested that there was great resentment and hostility, and I can vouch that there was. It is a complicated and difficult issue. I think it is assumed that we have taken a line in the film that has avoided those issues. I think I'm the best person to argue for that, because the transformation of the Mandras character was essentially a development that I brought to the film, which had no political motivation I have to say, but a dramatic motivation. I don't think that a film could take on the complexities of those arguments and still function. The book has an astonishing amplitude and range of reference; it is very digressive and jumps across locales. It spends time with Mandras and Hector and so forth in the ideological indoctrination and the beginnings of factionalism that led to the Greek civil war. In film terms, you simply have to create a hierarchy - what is the story? That would never have been in the brief of the film. Mandras' character and development had more to do with the way that character functions in the central story. The book presents you with certain challenges when trying to present a film story because the characters are strangely disconnected from one another's lives and experiences in the book. For example, Mandras and Corelli never meet in the book at all. The relationship Pelagia has with Mandras is over before Corelli arrives. The relationship with Corelli, the atrocities and the departure from the island is all over before Mandras returns. In simple dramatic terms, that seemed to me to be a lost opportunity. Not that that's a problem in the book, but in terms of examining that in the film, making every character's relationship to the central characters something organic, that was the idea at work. The Carlo situation is a similar one. Creating that hierarchy is a disappointing one in some ways because you're desperate to produce the richness of the book in the film as far as you can, and I struggled - I would like to say heroically - with Shawn, in order to bring that into the story, but in the end all we were doing was tokenising the story. We decided on a more radical inversion of that character that allowed him to work cinematically in a slightly different way. At the same time you are creating a piece that you hope stands alongside the book, independently of the book - because there'll be many people who will see the film who haven't read the book and I hope will then go to the book - but you will never do anyone a service by simply treading in the footsteps of the book. DM: You did as far as locations are concerned. Most films aren't shot on location, was it easy to choose the right location? JM: It was very hot and logistically seemed suicidal in many ways. Not so much of the money ends up onscreen theoretically because the reality is that it is an island and there is no infrastructure for making a film. You have to bring all the crew in from elsewhere in Greece. Obviously vast numbers of the construction crew were on the island, as you can see from the number of family names that crop up in the credits. Nevertheless, the majority of the crew has to be brought there and housed and everything else. Every single element of the production design was imported because every building was flattened by the earthquake of 1953, and destroyed everything pre-1953. DM: Absolutely everything? JM: Well, the only real house in it, oddly enough, is the scene that takes place at the beginning of the film where the pea is extracted from Stamatis's ear, that one building exists but everything else you see is built. In industry terms it made no sense, but in every other way, and ultimately in industry terms, it made a lot of sense. The film was very economic to make, but more significantly there was a quality about the island and the light and most significantly a quality about the people and the experiences that they'd had that was an invaluable resource for the film and kept us honest in a way. We were able to create, in a film grammar now of such sophistication it doesn't seem to be necessary, but we were able to connect one place to another on the island. You could see the village from the doctor's house, you could relate the beach that we'd decided to locate the Italian encampment on and so on. Some smell and dust and so forth of the actual experience that makes up the experience of that island, not to mention the cicadas, translates into the film and can't be eradicated from the film, even with modern technology - that was amazing. Particularly for me, when I went to the island and at the point I came onto the film, the island was a possibility for the film, Corfu was another favoured possibility, I was overwhelmed by the visual iconography of the place. By which I mean the rubble of the destruction, the routine destruction in historical terms of that island, is everywhere evident. They simply move down the hill and build the village again. They don't really bother to remove the rubble or indeed they build the house on top of the rubble of the one just destroyed. Something about that sense resonated incredibly for me with the themes of the book that I responded to that were to do with healing and regeneration and continuity and survival. My first instinct was how are we going to do this? We would have to hide the earthquake because it doesn't happen in the book and it wasn't in the script that I originally received. Then I felt that actually the opposite was true and it was a visual metaphor that was available all the time and crucial to the whole experience and meaning of the film. DM: Were you there during the shoot, Shawn? Did you feel like you wanted to change some things when you got there? SS: I think I was there because John came on so late JM: I'd have had you there anyway SS: Soon you'll have no choice - you'll have me on the call sheet and the clapperboard. Because John came in so late there was stuff that was unfinished. Because there was so much going on for him we couldn't actually focus until the end. Things kept changing JM: Yes, we kept working on it right until the end of the film. SS: It was a very dynamic process, it was very exciting. DM: It's not very often you can do that as a writer. SS: I don't think so, no. JM: That's why she was the only writer. I don't think I could have had ten of them there DM: Do you think it would ever be possible to make that sort of film with Italians playing Italians, Greeks playing Greeks and so on? JM: I think in all honesty, no. No. I would love it to be possible but I think the resources to realise a film of this size would prohibit it. I was not involved in the financing process of it, but as I referred to earlier, I'm not saying it was a prerequisite that we had an American actor. We might have had an Australian actor, guess who, we might have had an English actor, guess who, we might have had an Irish actor DM: Well, who? JM: Whether we could have had an Italian actorcertainly if I'd had been in at that part of the game and I had looked there and had found that actor I would not have hesitated to fight for that tooth and nail. Do I, in the reality of my own experience, think that that would have been possible without some counterbalance somewhere else, I don't think so. You make movies these days within a contextual reality. You shouldn't really attempt this sort of movie given the kind of resources it commands without to some extent absorbing that reality and accepting that reality. DM: The reality is that you have to sell in the American market? I'm not criticising JM: I don't take it as a criticism. You're stating a fact. I think that is probably true in terms of the first equation that has to be made. Take, for example, Enemy at the Gate, which is entirely European financed and does not have an American headlining star. It has two or three big English names and was made through a consortium and cost considerably more than this DM: The most expensive European film ever, I believe. JM: Indeed. This is a great development in the British movie industry that Jude Law, Rachel Weisz and Jo Fiennes are considered to be of a magnitude in the world market that justifies that kind of investment. Whether or not a relatively unknown Italian actor and Greek actress, who again we certainly would have cast - Viki Maragaki who plays Eleni was an actress who Roger Michell was looking at and certainly I was too - even with a European consortium could have sold the film, I very much doubt. DM: Is it not possible for a film to be successful in Europe and elsewhere without an American star for the American market? JM: No, I didn't say that. I don't think that the film would ever have been paid for. I think that that's the crucial issue, not whether it would have been successful. Unfortunately it's hard to get to the point where you can make that argument. But it has to do with the scale and ambition of the movie you're making. Wonderful movies are made that cost infinitely less than that. If you know you're going to take on this sort of story you know that it has a certain kind of scale and that's something you choose to accept or you don't. At the point that that particular choice presented itself to me, I made a decision, which is why I'm here. DM: Well, you've made three pretty successful decisions up to now. Do you think this is luck or good management? JM: Very kind of you to say so! DM: Well, I think this will make its money back, if nothing else. JM: Please quote that! We're going to put it on the posters tomorrow! I think the answer to your question is that luck is never far away. It's a very odd business. DM: You must have been very surprised, for instance, with Mrs Brown. JM: Well, yes. Incredibly surprised. All I ever think about is is this movie something I can muster my belief in sufficiently to carry everyone with you that you need to make the film? Will it work on its own terms? I don't think about the larger landscape, including this film, until now. It's very hard to know what contributes to it. I didn't know how Mrs Brown would turn out, though I certainly hoped that the film would end up in the cinema as it did. I had no expectation of where Shakespeare In Love would end up, I imagined it might work for a small coterie of people that had the same interest that I had. Likewise this. You just get on and make the film. You don't think about the rest of it. DM: And there's a lot of bad luck too. A World Apart was a very good film and never really did the business that was hoped. SS: That proves the importance of distribution, that's what it proves. The American backers went bankrupt so there were, I think, sixteen prints in the whole of America. It doesn't matter how good the film is if not enough people can get to see it. Thank you for that. DM: I'm sure there's some questions. Q1: Could you explain the process by which you wrote the script? Did Shawn write it and then John made his comments? To what extent was it working together and how did that change during the shoot? SS: It was a truly collaborative process, which is, I think, the best you can hope for in screenwriting - to be working with the director. We worked intensely together. We had long discussions in John's kitchen with Irena Brignall who was the story editor, brought in to speed up the process. John and Irena, because we had so little time, would plot ahead. John was also working out the film in his mind to make it his. I would go away and write, present the pages and then get brought up to speed, then go away and write. I wasn't dictated to, I have to say. That was the process. JM: It was very intense and very compressed because I originally assumed that the timetable of the film was very flexible, but Nicholas Cage had a John Woo picture to do and all we could do in the end was move their picture back a couple of weeks and frontload the schedule, so that most of Nick's work was done at the beginning. We had five months from when I came on board to assemble the film and rewrite it from scratch, which was an educational and thrilling process. The normal process of writing a script is normally a discussion followed by a complete draft from a writer which you then turn over and discuss and then the writer comes up with another draft. That wasn't possible in this case. SS: That was the way I worked with Roger, but we had four years. JM: And no deadline. Then suddenly we had a deadline and nothing else! It's not to say that Roger's script might not have gone on to develop in another way. It's got nothing to do with ego, but as a director you have to commit to and be accountable for every single decision and moment in the film because they'll be thousands of decisions that rest on that one choice. So you've got to know where you are and believe in it. It's a massive book and you have to say, 'This is my way through this book'. The process of working on it was a weird one because you'd get so far and then before you could ratify that you had to go back and make other changes, so we really didn't ever get as far as a first draft of the script until about a month before we were due to go there. That's when Louis came into the equation. At my behest we left certain parts of the film in what I would call a holding pattern, they were stacked up and waiting to land. As the identity of the film began to emerge in the shooting process, certain ideas started to slot into place about the form the script should take. That went on for the whole period we were shooting. Q: With regard to the finance, is it possible to open up to small investors, like a sort of stock market? JM: An extraordinary amount of imagination is used now in the financing of movies. As regards to the financing of this movie, many of those elements were already in place. I don't know if I'm the best person to speak about that at this juncture, but that certainly is a way of going, but it's extraordinarily difficult. The huge struggle for many movies is to put the finance in place and for everybody to lock and agree that the financing is there. Almost always that financing is based on elements that are involved in the film that give the investors some guarantee of visibility, some sense that the movie can open because of the interest generated by the elements involved and those are things you don't know in advance. The more expensive the film, the more difficult it becomes. DM: Is it getting easier or more difficult to write an intelligent script? How easy is it to get it through? SS: You mean to get an intelligent script made? I think that there is a dumbing down at every single level because films are so expensive people are unwilling to take risks. Independent film-making is not what it was and theatres are closing all over the country here, independent theatres. DM: But audiences are increasing, but for the same old films. SS: It's youth that goes to the cinema, and they seem quite happy with what they get. For older people it's getting harder and harder to find something interesting to see at the cinema. JM: Those kind of films do get through, but they're the ones that come from behind and buck the system. I think in mainstream movie-making your question is a valid one. I think that even if a script does break through, certain pressures are brought to bear on it that threaten the degree of new territory it's carving out. Q: How did Nicolas Cage become involved and what influence did he have on how the film was made? JM: The answer is he became involved because he was enormously attracted to the material. He did the movie for a fraction of his normal price - still expensive, but not punitively expensive. He is an actor who I would fly the flag for whether he was in my film or not because he is an actor who is hungry and curious and to some extent swims in the mainstream precisely because it gives him the opportunity to swim up the tributaries now and then. The film for which he is most applauded for is a film nobody in the mainstream would have made, Leaving Las Vegas. He is attracted to areas he has not explored as an actor before, and that is to be applauded in a business where you are encouraged to stay exactly where you are. Also, he had never made a film outside of America. I'm not sure he'd left California, God bless him. SS: He experienced jetlag! JM: That's why he took it on. The only way in which he affected production where circumstances not really under his control which had to do with deadlines. He is a consummate professional. A man without any grandeur on the set. He comes, like any actor, you hope, very well prepared having thought incredibly hard about what he's doing, with a suitcase full of nutty ideas. The first rehearsal of any scene was always entertaining, and he's very happy to put those ideas back in the suitcase, and frequently he did. He's completely delightful, serious, professional, imaginative and daring. For an actor who is pretty much at the top of the tree in the system, I love that about him. I think he is a top man and he has been completely supportive of the film and he will go anywhere to support it, within the terms of his own schedule, and good for him. Q: What was it like to work with P\u00e9nelope Cruz? JM: She's an actress in a very peculiar position at the moment. She is a hugely well-respected actress in Spain who has done an enormous range of work. She is somebody who, because of the way she looks and because of the sequence of movies she has made, has got a profile which belies who she really is. This culminated in a scurrilous and disgusting article that appeared, I think, in ES magazine, and whoever wrote it had no right to do so, because she is the most real person imaginable. She is an actress of extraordinary skill and you can compare her to Liv Ulman, who I've also worked with. She has a capacity to reveal herself, simply open herself to the camera, not to indicate anything, not to put a spin on anything. I think she's an extraordinary talent who has a fantastic future. She must now continue to work in her own culture, and she's making a film in Spain as we speak. I think you're only just beginning to see what she's capable of. She can transform herself, in this film, from someone who is eighteen years of age to someone who carries the weight and melancholy of someone who is three times that age. Q: That's a very different P\u00e9nelope Cruz from the P\u00e9nelope Cruz in the magazines. JM: Well, I hope so. Because she is somebody who is happy to have her photograph taken, all kinds of motives are imputed to her, it seems, that are without justification. She was on the island the entire time with her family, eating at the next-door table to us all the time. She is someone who is born to act, I think, she naturally inhabits other personae with an invisible grace and skill, but she's, above all, real. She knows who she is, she knows who her friends are, she knows what life's about, she won't mind if it all goes away, which it won't and I'm astonished at the degree of cynicism there is about that. I'm astonished in one way, and in another I'm not. We all have to work within this system of hype and so forth. She is somebody who has got used to the way the press manipulate her. Q: Can you tell us about the involvement of Louis De Berni\u00e8res? JM: Well Louis was offered the opportunity to adapt the material and write it for a film, but nothing would bore him more, I think. Film writing is a completely inferior process. SS: He says it's lower than being a schoolteacher. JM: He had no interest in that. He had interest only in the fact that the film was made by a British company and in Europe with European sensibilities in mind. That was his concern, and that was fulfilled when Working Title became involved. Aside from reading the draft of the script as it came along, he was very happy to be at arm length. My normal instinct would have been to absolutely rope him into the process, but under the circumstances under which I came into the film, I simply could not do that because of the constraints I was under. There wasn't time. I had to essentially go to him with a first draft of the script which he was alarmed and intrigued by. He came out and joined us on the film for two or three weeks while we were shooting and he had a whale of a time. He didn't really come back into the process until I showed him my first cut of the film and he was, I think, rather thrilled and rather baffled. He is a great friend of Esther Freud who is married to David Morrissey who plays Weber in the film, so I knew he was terrified of seeing it because he was terrified of it being absolutely awful. He was terrified also that it might be rather good. I imagine he found it to be somewhere in-between. I don't know. He was very excited, but still not quite sure. He saw it again a month later and became very pleased with it. He's now seen it six times and he's very happy. I have to say that given the journalistic line about us being unfaithful to the book, he has an absolutely admirable attitude which is that the film and the book must be seen as two different things. As long as I'm committed to the emotional arc of the story, then fine. The book will always be there on the shelves and hopefully many people will go back and read it. He is incredibly funny and loose about it and was as involved as he wanted to be really.",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair yesterday braced his party for bruising setbacks in the election campaign he will launch today when he admitted that the Labour government has \"not done everything people want\" and must fight for every vote. As the prime minister primed the cabinet for his ritual drive to Buckingham Palace to inform the Queen - probably this afternoon - he had already been shown how even the best-laid campaign strategies can be blown off course. William Hague used what was officially billed as the launch of the Conservatives' manifesto for local election day - also on June 7 - to argue that Labour has \"the same record of incompetence, arrogance, mismanagement and efficiency in local government\" as at national level. There were also two unwelcome sallies for Labour from Europe. In an ill-timed initiative for the government, German chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der told fellow socialist leaders in Berlin, including the foreign secretary Robin Cook, deputising for Mr Blair, that they must \"rigorously further develop the European integration process\". In Brussels - before flying home in time for the special cabinet - Gordon Brown, the chancellor, was also forced on the defensive to denounce integrationist forces in the shape of a European commission critique of his ambitious spending plans for health and education in 2001-4. His complaints were ignored, guaranteeing that it will resurface at the next meeting of EU finance ministers on June 5, two days before polling day. The commitment to \"investment and reform\" in the public services is the centrepiece of Labour's election campaign - just as a fierce determination to prove that Mr Brown's \"stealth taxes\" have been wasted is crucial to Mr Hague's slim hopes of an upset. At yesterday's cabinet meeting to rubberstamp Labour's manifesto, Mr Blair admitted it would be tricky to ignite public enthusiasm for revitalised schools and hospitals at the same time as confessing to only limited success so far. \"We have to go out and earn every single piece of support wherever it is and do so with a sense of humility. We have not done everything people want and the focus of our campaign will be every bit as much on what we still have to do as what we have done,\" he admitted. The Tories will seize upon that.

      "body": "<p>Sometimes it's hard to be a Tory. Now that the election is due, gallant Conservative activists are rushing about trying to line up the cavalry against the cannon with all the resolution of despair, but we all know there is very likely going to be a massacre. This may be a very amusing spectacle for Guardian readers, but anyone with Conservative sympathies like me must prepare to bite the bullet.</p> <p>I don't actually belong to the Conservative party, and never have. I am, none the less, a conservative, with a small c if not necessarily a large one, and I have been writing as a libertarian fellow traveller for the Telegraph papers for more than 10 years. A Labour victory will depress me just as much as the most tireless canvasser in the shires.</p> <p>It will also astonish me. I simply cannot understand why the electorate has not yet seen through the People's Prime Minister, with his adjustable accent, his adjustable features and his adjustable biography. I cannot see why Labour supporters are not now miserably ashamed of him. I cannot imagine why nothing seems to touch Labour's truly astonishing lead. What would it take? The Conservatives at their worst produced nothing to compare with Robinson, Vaz, Ecclestone, Irvine, the Hindujas, Falconer, Mandelson, the Dome, a House of Lords packed (in the name of democratic reform) with Tony's cronies, and the astonishingly cynical rescue of Phoenix the calf, who rose up ludicrously from the dying ashes of Labour government incompetence and of Labour party morality. And this in only four years.</p> <p>Perhaps voters don't care. Perhaps they assume all politicians are determined to get their trotters into the top trough, and better our politicians than theirs. This is the Clinton effect: pork and porkies don't matter so long as there is plenty of prosperity.</p> <p>But even so, there have been all kinds of disasters and promises broken that ought by themselves to have slashed the Labour lead. The NHS is a disgrace. So are most schools and most public transport. Most people with any money pay their way out of public services; continental Europeans can hardly believe how bad they are.</p> <p>Yet taxes have gone up hugely under Labour, along with government intervention and red tape. This has hit the poorest hardest; the gap between rich and poor is now much greater than when Blair and Brown came to power, productivity is down and savings have collapsed.</p> <p>Why should all this lead to a Labour landslide? The answer is deeply humiliating. It is not that the voters love Labour - Blair is actually more unpopular than Neil Kinnock and Blair's so-called landslide of 1997 got fewer votes than Major's win in 1992. It isn't even that Hague is so desperately unpopular. It must be that people truly loathe the Conservatives. What's more, quite a lot of Conservatives rather loathe themselves or each other; the Left was never right, we feel, but the Right, though right, has often been rather Repulsive, as in 1066 and All That.</p> <p>This doesn't matter much in itself, I suppose; we can't all expect to like each other, and life seems to be irredeemably tribal. But I think it matters for this country. Conservatism has saved Britain from ruin. Conservatism gave it the prosperity it now enjoys. Even New Labour saw that and tried to steal its clothes, but has unfortunately not known how to wear them, or keep them on. It would be a great pity if an unthinking loathing for Conservatives, based on old-fashioned stereotypes of hatchet-faced bigots from the shires, and heartless tax avoiders in City suits, were to blind people to the real virtues of Conservatism.</p> <p>Just as most people have been misled by Mr Blair's bogus charm, most people have been misled by Conservatives' bogus beastliness. It's true we do have some people saying very hard things about standing on your own feet, or getting on your own bike, and a few others saying quite unspeakable things about race. And I find it deeply embarrassing to say I support a party in which Ann Widdecombe is such a star, and in my view so deeply un-Conservative. Conservatism all too often manages to be wearing its most unacceptable face, with a perversity that perhaps explains its reputation as the stupid people's party.</p> <p>In fact, real Conservatism is for the intelligent. It doesn't offer the easy-to-follow feel-good promises of socialism or of New Labour, as in oxymoronic slogans like Excellence For All. It rests on a complex collection of ideas which are not in themselves very inspiring - realism, compromise, scepticism and the pragmatic pursuit of the least worst in government, with as little government intrusion as possible. It stands for freedom, for its own sake and as a defence against the evils of statism. That is Conservatism. Voters may not want it, but it hardly deserves the astonishing humiliation it is receiving.</p>",

Now that the election is due, gallant Conservative activists are rushing about trying to line up the cavalry against the cannon with all the resolution of despair, but we all know there is very likely going to be a massacre. This may be a very amusing spectacle for Guardian readers, but anyone with Conservative sympathies like me must prepare to bite the bullet. I don't actually belong to the Conservative party, and never have. I am, none the less, a conservative, with a small c if not necessarily a large one, and I have been writing as a libertarian fellow traveller for the Telegraph papers for more than 10 years. A Labour victory will depress me just as much as the most tireless canvasser in the shires. It will also astonish me. I simply cannot understand why the electorate has not yet seen through the People's Prime Minister, with his adjustable accent, his adjustable features and his adjustable biography. I cannot see why Labour supporters are not now miserably ashamed of him. I cannot imagine why nothing seems to touch Labour's truly astonishing lead. What would it take? The Conservatives at their worst produced nothing to compare with Robinson, Vaz, Ecclestone, Irvine, the Hindujas, Falconer, Mandelson, the Dome, a House of Lords packed (in the name of democratic reform) with Tony's cronies, and the astonishingly cynical rescue of Phoenix the calf, who rose up ludicrously from the dying ashes of Labour government incompetence and of Labour party morality. And this in only four years. Perhaps voters don't care. Perhaps they assume all politicians are determined to get their trotters into the top trough, and better our politicians than theirs. This is the Clinton effect: pork and porkies don't matter so long as there is plenty of prosperity. But even so, there have been all kinds of disasters and promises broken that ought by themselves to have slashed the Labour lead. The NHS is a disgrace. So are most schools and most public transport. Most people with any money pay their way out of public services; continental Europeans can hardly believe how bad they are. Yet taxes have gone up hugely under Labour, along with government intervention and red tape. This has hit the poorest hardest; the gap between rich and poor is now much greater than when Blair and Brown came to power, productivity is down and savings have collapsed. Why should all this lead to a Labour landslide? The answer is deeply humiliating. It is not that the voters love Labour - Blair is actually more unpopular than Neil Kinnock and Blair's so-called landslide of 1997 got fewer votes than Major's win in 1992. It isn't even that Hague is so desperately unpopular. It must be that people truly loathe the Conservatives. What's more, quite a lot of Conservatives rather loathe themselves or each other; the Left was never right, we feel, but the Right, though right, has often been rather Repulsive, as in 1066 and All That. This doesn't matter much in itself, I suppose; we can't all expect to like each other, and life seems to be irredeemably tribal. But I think it matters for this country. Conservatism has saved Britain from ruin. Conservatism gave it the prosperity it now enjoys. Even New Labour saw that and tried to steal its clothes, but has unfortunately not known how to wear them, or keep them on. It would be a great pity if an unthinking loathing for Conservatives, based on old-fashioned stereotypes of hatchet-faced bigots from the shires, and heartless tax avoiders in City suits, were to blind people to the real virtues of Conservatism. Just as most people have been misled by Mr Blair's bogus charm, most people have been misled by Conservatives' bogus beastliness. It's true we do have some people saying very hard things about standing on your own feet, or getting on your own bike, and a few others saying quite unspeakable things about race. And I find it deeply embarrassing to say I support a party in which Ann Widdecombe is such a star, and in my view so deeply un-Conservative. Conservatism all too often manages to be wearing its most unacceptable face, with a perversity that perhaps explains its reputation as the stupid people's party. In fact, real Conservatism is for the intelligent. It doesn't offer the easy-to-follow feel-good promises of socialism or of New Labour, as in oxymoronic slogans like Excellence For All. It rests on a complex collection of ideas which are not in themselves very inspiring - realism, compromise, scepticism and the pragmatic pursuit of the least worst in government, with as little government intrusion as possible. It stands for freedom, for its own sake and as a defence against the evils of statism. That is Conservatism. Voters may not want it, but it hardly deserves the astonishing humiliation it is receiving.",

The pledges unveiled in the local election manifesto pro vided a taster of the rightwing policies which will form the centrepiece of the Tories' general election manifesto. In a section in the local election manifesto, entitled Helping Teenage Mothers and Families, the Tories pledged to scrap Labour plans to house unmarried teenage mothers in special hostels. \"The first question when an unwed teenager is pregnant should not be whether there is council flat for her, but whether her parents can support her and her child when she finishes school or look for work,\" the manifesto said. \"Councils and housing associations need to think very carefully about the signals they send out when they allocate social housing.\" Threatening to remove the right of unmarried young mothers to a council flat will upset some Tories on the left of the party.

      "bodyText": "Marketeers are cutting back spending on all areas of their activity, apart from staffing levels, as the profession faces up to the possibility of recession. This could be bad news for advertising agencies, which will take a hit as marketers reduce their advertising budgets. This is one of the key revelations of the Chartered Institute of Marketing's spring 2001 trends survey, to be published on tomorrow. Results of the survey suggest the decline in the US stock market and problems associated with foot and mouth disease have affected marketeers' outlook since the winter 2001 survey. Although sales targets have been revised downwards, confidence among marketeers about achieving those targets is low. The CIM Confidence Index has risen from 89.3% in the winter survey to 89.7%, presumably due to lower sales targets. But even with this very small rise in confidence, the index remains at a historically low level. Expenditure on all areas of marketing activity is suffering as a result and an increase of just 2.9% is planned for spending on total sales operations. The overall staffing levels of marketing departments do not appear to be in decline, however, with 81% per cent of respondents reporting no changes will be made their staffing levels. But because staffing levels are holding steady, in-house marketeers can be fairly confident although advertising agencies and outside suppliers should be less so. When asked about their priorities for the coming year, two thirds of respondents said building their share of the UK market was a priority. The results of the spring 2001 Marketing Trends Survey reflect a marketing profession exercising caution in the face of potential economic problems.

His extradition, or abduction, over what the Palestinian authorities say is a long-unpaid debt, has begun to shed unflattering light on the PLO's usually opaque management of its money.</p> <p>His daughter, Mona Bauwens, and his son, Tawfiq, have been waging a fax and email campaign to secure his release and hinting that he knows enough to blow the lid off PLO corruption.</p> <p>Ms Bauwens shot to fame a few years ago after David Mellor, the Tory minister, and his family accepted a holiday in Marbella at her expense.</p> <p>The cause of the row, according to Palestinian sources, is an unpaid loan of $6.5m (\u00a34.6m) which Mr Ghussein borrowed from the Palestinian National Fund in 1991 while he was the fund's chairman - in effect, the PLO's treasurer.</p> <p>According to this version, Mr Ghussein insisted he was solvent but asked for a three-month loan to tide him over a financial difficulty, offering property worldwide as security.</p> <p>The PLO leader, Yasser Arafat, personally approved the loan, these sources say.</p> <p>In 1998, claiming non-payment of its loan, the PLO obtained a judgment against him in the High Court in London for the full amount plus interest, but then found it was unable to enforce the order.</p> <p>Amjad Salfiti, the PLO's London solicitor, said: \"We found that he had put away most of his properties into trusts. Then we learned that another creditor was filing for bankruptcy.\"</p> <p>Mr Ghussein was formally declared bankrupt in the UK in 1999. The creditor which started the bankruptcy action was a South African company which claimed \u00a3334,000.</p> <p>Mr Ghussein's trustee in bankruptcy, Lee Manning of Kroll Buchler Phillips, is still pursuing the money. \"He has substantial assets in Abu Dhabi which are more than enough to meet his liabilities, but the law is complicated,\" Mr Manning said. \"There have also been movements of assets within the UK which we are investigating.\"</p> <p>Tawfiq Ghussein denies that his father owes the PLO money. He says the row is not about a loan but about an \"unsuccessful investment\" which was made by his father in 1991 with Mr Arafat's approval. \"We have the original transfer papers signed by Arafat himself. It was done in England but is governed by Swiss law. We will release them when the time is right,\" he said.</p> <p>According to Tawfiq, the matter was fully resolved in 1992 when his father, \"through no legal or moral obligation\" handed over 46 plots of land in Jordan to Mr Arafat's legal adviser, Zuhair al-Khatib.</p> <p>He says the High Court order in London was granted in his father's absence. \"They put documents through the letter box of my sister's flat. He wasn't aware of that. The claim was wrongly served and not defended.\"</p> <p>Solicitors for the PLO did attempt to serve a writ at a flat in Mayfair which they believed to be Mr Ghussein's address. Ms Bauwens then engaged solicitors to inform them that the address was her home and that her father was no longer living in Britain.</p> <p>Mr Salfiti insists that the writ was properly served. \"It was served in line with the rules in the UK,\" he said. \"Mr Ghussein had the opportunity to challenge service but he has not done so. Also, he has not appealed against the court order or applied to have it set aside.\"</p> <p>In the meantime, Jaweed al-Ghussein had moved to Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates - where he has a company called Cordoba Development Corporation - and the PLO began to pursue him there.</p> <p>According to his son, the PLO won its court action in the UAE but this was overturned by the supreme court on appeal.</p> <p>Palestinian sources say the supreme court's ruling was conditional: it gave Mr Ghussein a month to produce documents and find someone to stand bail, but when the deadline expired he had not done so. Mr Arafat then sent one of his close associates, Mahmoud Abbas (\"Abu Mazen\"), to the Emirates with a letter for the president, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan.</p> <p>Shortly afterwards, Mr Ghussein, who is 71 and a diabetic, was arrested by UAE police at a late-night party and flown to Gaza. The legal basis of Mr Ghussein's enforced removal to Gaza is unclear. The Palestinian Authority has no extradition treaty with the UAE and Tawfiq says that in any case his father should have had the right to appeal against extradition.</p>",

According to this version, Mr Ghussein insisted he was solvent but asked for a three-month loan to tide him over a financial difficulty, offering property worldwide as security. The PLO leader, Yasser Arafat, personally approved the loan, these sources say. In 1998, claiming non-payment of its loan, the PLO obtained a judgment against him in the High Court in London for the full amount plus interest, but then found it was unable to enforce the order. Amjad Salfiti, the PLO's London solicitor, said: \"We found that he had put away most of his properties into trusts. Then we learned that another creditor was filing for bankruptcy.\" Mr Ghussein was formally declared bankrupt in the UK in 1999. The creditor which started the bankruptcy action was a South African company which claimed \u00a3334,000. Mr Ghussein's trustee in bankruptcy, Lee Manning of Kroll Buchler Phillips, is still pursuing the money. \"He has substantial assets in Abu Dhabi which are more than enough to meet his liabilities, but the law is complicated,\" Mr Manning said. \"There have also been movements of assets within the UK which we are investigating.\" Tawfiq Ghussein denies that his father owes the PLO money. He says the row is not about a loan but about an \"unsuccessful investment\" which was made by his father in 1991 with Mr Arafat's approval. \"We have the original transfer papers signed by Arafat himself. It was done in England but is governed by Swiss law. We will release them when the time is right,\" he said. According to Tawfiq, the matter was fully resolved in 1992 when his father, \"through no legal or moral obligation\" handed over 46 plots of land in Jordan to Mr Arafat's legal adviser, Zuhair al-Khatib. He says the High Court order in London was granted in his father's absence. \"They put documents through the letter box of my sister's flat. He wasn't aware of that. The claim was wrongly served and not defended.\" Solicitors for the PLO did attempt to serve a writ at a flat in Mayfair which they believed to be Mr Ghussein's address. Ms Bauwens then engaged solicitors to inform them that the address was her home and that her father was no longer living in Britain. Mr Salfiti insists that the writ was properly served. \"It was served in line with the rules in the UK,\" he said. \"Mr Ghussein had the opportunity to challenge service but he has not done so. Also, he has not appealed against the court order or applied to have it set aside.\" In the meantime, Jaweed al-Ghussein had moved to Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates - where he has a company called Cordoba Development Corporation - and the PLO began to pursue him there. According to his son, the PLO won its court action in the UAE but this was overturned by the supreme court on appeal. Palestinian sources say the supreme court's ruling was conditional: it gave Mr Ghussein a month to produce documents and find someone to stand bail, but when the deadline expired he had not done so. Mr Arafat then sent one of his close associates, Mahmoud Abbas (\"Abu Mazen\"), to the Emirates with a letter for the president, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan. Shortly afterwards, Mr Ghussein, who is 71 and a diabetic, was arrested by UAE police at a late-night party and flown to Gaza. The legal basis of Mr Ghussein's enforced removal to Gaza is unclear. The Palestinian Authority has no extradition treaty with the UAE and Tawfiq says that in any case his father should have had the right to appeal against extradition.",

      "bodyText": "An official investigation into the Hatfield rail crash, in which four people died, has shown that Railtrack knew about problems with the track two years before the tragedy, it emerged last night. A draft report of the official industry investigation reveals that Railtrack was first aware of a problem with the Hatfield track in 1998. It had previously only admitted to finding the cracks in November 1999, a year before the disaster. According to a report in today's Financial Times, the investigation cites a litany of management failure by rail chiefs and engineers in the lead-up to the crash. It claims that despite the discovery of gauge corner cracking on the track, a series of mistakes, lack of knowledge and poor communications meant the repairs had not been carried out by the time of the crash in October last year. Instructions were given to put the problem right within six months of discovering it, but these were not acted on. Four people died when a GNER London to Leeds high-speed train was derailed at Hatfield after the track shattered into 300 pieces. The train had been travelling at 115mph but 20mph speed restrictions were later imposed - something Railtrack admitted it should have done before the crash. According to the Financial Times, the report says a track inspector employed by Balfour Beatty admitted he regularly walked in a ditch beside the Hatfield track, giving him an inadequate view of the the rail. Ultrasonic tests carried out by Balfour Beatty every three months gave results that should have indicated a serious problem, but they appear not to have been acted on. The unpublished report claims there is a \"strong probability\" that the track was broken before the train passed over it. The 113-page report, based on an inquiry by Railway Safety, the industry's safety body chaired by retired rail engineer John Mitchell, focused on the actions of employees at Railtrack and its maintenance contractor, Balfour Beatty Rail Maintenance Limited. Evidence was also taken from Jarvis, the company employed to carry out track replacements by Railtrack. Mr Mitchell criticised the written evidence for being of \"limited value\", and Railtrack, British Transport police and the health and safety executive for holding back important documents. \"These decisions have undoubtedly lengthened the inquiry timescale, and have proved to be a serious handicap in establishing the facts,\" he said.

      "bodyText": "Rural businesses yesterday dismissed an extra \u00a324m announced by the government to help firms affected by the foot and mouth crisis, and made plans to demonstrate outside parliament tomorrow. The environment minister, Michael Meacher, announced the creation of a recovery fund to help small and medium-sized businesses in areas worst hit by closed footpaths and the absence of tourists. Businesses would receive up to \u00a315,000 in grants for marketing support, skills improvement and IT investment to help them adapt. There will also be grants to meet interest repayments on borrowings caused by the crisis, which is costing English tourism alone \u00a3140m a week. Mr Meacher said: \"Small tourism and other country businesses are essential to the health of the rural economy. We want to ensure that viable businesses can survive to help land recovery in these areas. \"This fund should provide direct help to up to 10,000 small and medium-sized businesses, and wider benefits to all rural businesses affected by foot and mouth.\" The total offered to rural businesses since the crisis began is more than \u00a3250m. But yesterday rural business owners said no money had reached them, and that the government's idea of skills seminars and so on was a farce; they wanted cash compensation and the opening of footpaths. Deborah Cowin, a member of the self-styled Cumbria Crisis Alliance, is a gallery director and bespoke jeweller in Keswick; she had taken one order since March, she said. \"It is an insult to offer us seminars,\" she said. \"We are all from thriving, growing businesses. We do not need special advice. We need cash aid. We need to retain staff. \"All we have seen so far is three months' hardship rate relief. The government is nibbling around the edge of the problem and we are becoming a forgotten strata of society. We are dispossessed.\" Ms Cowin said rural proprietors from Cumbria, Devon and Wales would demonstrate at the lack of government support in London tomorrow. Steve Binder, director of the Newlands adventure centre in Keswick, said he had taken taken \u00a39.87 since March, compared with \u00a325,000 last year. He said: \"We just see money being poured into the wrong places. I have very little faith in the ability of the government to target money directly. We never see it.\" Rosemary Keen, a guesthouse owner in Ambleside, said of the government's help so far: \"This money they are talking about is fictitious. I haven't seen anybody who has got any of this money yet, apart from the rate relief.\" Judy Carless said her restaurant in Exmoor national park had been closed since February: \"This is an absolute waste of time. It is going to have to be cash aid. I don't see how else they can do it. We have been totally forgotten.\" The extra funding came as an animal sanctuary owner in Dumfries and Galloway and a farmer on Exmoor launch court cases to stop their animals being culled. Juanita Wilson of the Mossburn animal centre in Hightae, said she had put \u00a310,000 of personal savings into a fight to prevent 14 goats and three sheep being culled by slaughtermen directed by the Scottish executive. A local vet had given animals the all clear, she said. \"I'm prepared to go to the court of session in Edinburgh. We will no doubt lose, but I have been assured by my QC that we can take our case to the Lords and the European court of human rights.\" Some 75 people have surrounded the centre to block entry. Christopher Thomas-Everard, whose 980 cattle were due to be the first slaughtered on Exmoor, yesterday vowed to fight the Ministry of Agriculture in court. The animals were ordered to be culled after a visit 12 days ago from a de-horning contractor from Wilvelscombe, which has several foot and mouth cases. Mr Thomas-Everard said his cattle had been declared healthy by vets.",

      "bodyText": "The Zimbabwean opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, won an important first round victory against the government at his terrorism trial yesterday when the high court questioned the constitutionality of oppressive British colonial-era laws used to charge him. The high court postponed the trial while the supreme court considers whether President Robert Mugabe can even use the notorious Law and Order (Maintenance) Act which has been wielded by every Zimbabwean government for four decades to oppress opponents. If the supreme court strikes down either the entire act or the section dealing with terrorism, it will not only end Mr Tsvangirai's prosecution but possibly remove an important weapon from Mr Mugabe's arsenal in his battle with all manner of opponents. The act has been used to prevent anti-government demonstrations, to try to curb critical journalism and to justify violence against dissenters. Judge Moses Chinhengo delivered his blow to the government's case on the first day of the trial: \"It is common knowledge that the Law and Order (Maintenance) Act is a piece of colonial legislation that was introduced in 1960, before this country got a justiciable Bill of Rights in 1980,\" he said. \"That historical fact suggests that in the new order, the act will be sorely tested each time it is relied upon by the state to prosecute an individual.\" No date was set for the supreme court hearing but if it upholds the law, the case will be referred back to the high court. Mr Tsvangirai is on trial for terrorism, for a remark he made at a rally of his Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) party last September warning Mr Mugabe to resign after the opposition came close to winning parliamentary elections. \"We say to Robert Mugabe, if you don't want to go peacefully, we will remove you violently,\" he said. The prosecutor, Nathaniel Sibanda, told the court yesterday that Mr Tsvangirai's words were an incitement to revolution. \"The charges are directed at mischief of the highest order, which is calling for the violent removal of a lawfully elected president in a democratic state,\" he said. But many Zimbabweans see the trial as an attempt to prevent Mr Tsvangirai running for president against Mr Mugabe. If the opposition leader is convicted and given more than six months in prison he would be barred from high office. Yesterday, Mr Tsvangirai praised the independence of the judiciary despite attempts by the government to purge the courts of \"disloyal\" judges. The supreme court is still considered independent with four of its five judges resisting pressure to resign. The fifth judge - Zimbabwe's new chief justice - was appointed in March after his white predecessor was threatened until he took early retirement. Judge Chinhengo said the supreme court should decide whether the two sections of the Law and Order act under which Mr Tsvangirai is charged infringe the right to free speech and the right to be considered innocent until proved guilty. But the court could scrutinise the entire act if it chose. It was introduced in 1960 by the British colonial authorities to curb the activities of African nationalists pressing for the then Southern Rhodesia to become independent. The law was made even tougher by Ian Smith's white minority regime after its unilateral declaration of independence as Rhodesia. The white government used the act to jail Mr Mugabe for 10 years without a trial. Mr Tsvangirai's lawyer, Chris Andersen, was a minister of justice in the Smith government - although not the one who sent Mr Mugabe to prison. Yesterday he was challenging the constitutionality of a law he used repeatedly before independence. Two sections of the act - forbidding public gatherings without a police order and barring journalists from publishing news that might cause \"fear and despondency\" - have already been struck down by the supreme court. Mr Mugabe's information minister, Jonathan Moyo, said the government would respect the high court ruling. \"We respect the institution of an independent judiciary and we look forward to the outcome of the supreme court case,\" he said. \"It is interesting that so many international journalists came here for this case.

      "body": "<p>The new Japanese prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi sketched out his plans for surgery on the world's second biggest economy yesterday in a parliamentary speech that warned the population to grit its teeth for agonising change. </p> <p>Echoing the promises of reform that won him a surprise victory in last month's Liberal Democratic party leadership election, Mr Koizumi said Japan would have to slash banks' non-performing loans, trim government spending and wean the economy off of an addiction to public works projects. </p> <p>\"In the process of implementing structural reforms, there will be a shake-up of inefficient sectors and pain in society,\" a grim-faced Koizumi said in comparing himself to the Meiji-era revolutionaries who modernised Japan in the mid-19th century. </p> <p>\"Adopting a stance that does not fear pain, does not flinch at the barriers of vested interests, and is not shackled by the experience of the past, I want to establish an economic and social system suitable for the 21st century.\" </p> <p>While short on specifics, the message is likely to go down well with voters and investors, who have welcomed Mr Koizumi's determination to confront powerful lobbies within his own party that have repeatedly blocked reforms. </p> <p>A poll by public broadcaster NHK showed Mr Koizumi is the most popular prime minister in living memory with a support rating of 81%, against less than 10% for his predecessor Yoshiro Mori. </p> <p>The moneymen have also indicated their approval of the new premier. Mr Koizumi's speech yesterday drove the main Nikkei-225 index above 14,500 points for the first time in nearly six months. </p> <p>So far the change has been more one of style than substance.

      "bodyText": "The new Japanese prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi sketched out his plans for surgery on the world's second biggest economy yesterday in a parliamentary speech that warned the population to grit its teeth for agonising change. Echoing the promises of reform that won him a surprise victory in last month's Liberal Democratic party leadership election, Mr Koizumi said Japan would have to slash banks' non-performing loans, trim government spending and wean the economy off of an addiction to public works projects. \"In the process of implementing structural reforms, there will be a shake-up of inefficient sectors and pain in society,\" a grim-faced Koizumi said in comparing himself to the Meiji-era revolutionaries who modernised Japan in the mid-19th century. \"Adopting a stance that does not fear pain, does not flinch at the barriers of vested interests, and is not shackled by the experience of the past, I want to establish an economic and social system suitable for the 21st century.\" While short on specifics, the message is likely to go down well with voters and investors, who have welcomed Mr Koizumi's determination to confront powerful lobbies within his own party that have repeatedly blocked reforms. A poll by public broadcaster NHK showed Mr Koizumi is the most popular prime minister in living memory with a support rating of 81%, against less than 10% for his predecessor Yoshiro Mori. The moneymen have also indicated their approval of the new premier. Mr Koizumi's speech yesterday drove the main Nikkei-225 index above 14,500 points for the first time in nearly six months. So far the change has been more one of style than substance. Most of the contents of the new administration's policy package were drawn up before Mr Koizumi took power. Echoing his predecessor - but with considerably more conviction - the new prime minister said his government will clear up the problem of bad loans - estimated at between 30 trillion and 110 trillion yen (\u00a3171bn-\u00a3630bn) - in two to three years. Anticipating that this would drive many firms into bankruptcy, he also pledged to establish a stronger safety net for the unemployed. In a short-term measure to lift stock prices, Mr Koizumi said a body would be established to buy up bank share holdings and tax relief would be introduced for profits made by individuals through equity deals. He said he would establish advisory panels to consider the possible election of the prime minister through a popular vote and the privatisation of the postal savings system, which is now effectively the world's biggest bank. To boost competition, the administration will strengthen the powers of the fair trade commission and other regulators. The biggest test for Mr Koizumi will be on fiscal policy, where the prime minister pledged to cap the issuance of government bonds to \u00a530 trillion a year as a first step towards reining in a public debt.",

      "bodyText": "The Home Office is facing intense pressure to delay the introduction of a \u00a32.5bn police communications system amid warnings it may expose users to health risks on a par with asbestos. Two independent experts on the biological effects of electromagnetic radiation have accused ministers of using the police as guinea pigs by pressing on with the launch of the BT Airwave system in the absence of detailed research into potential health risks. The advanced digital system, which is being piloted by Lancashire police before being given to every force in the country by 2005, has been welcomed as a technological leap forward. Using the Terrestrial Trunk Radio System (Tetra), the new European standard for emergency service communications, Airwave offers guaranteed national coverage, vastly improved sound quality, better security through encryption and features such as data transfer and emergency buttons on officers' handsets. Forces have been complaining for years that the current analogue radio system is woefully inadequate as it does not cover some locations, is prone to break down at crucial times and fails to provide essential security. So confident was the government of the benefits of Tetra that it sold off the existing police frequencies as part of the \u00a320bn auction of licences for the next generation of mobile phones. But concern is growing that electromagnetic radiation emissions from the handsets may pose a direct health risk for the users. The fear centres on the operating frequency of 17.6Hz assigned to Tetra when the system was being established. This means that it emits radiation in pulses occurring 17.6 times a second, a level some scientists believe can penetrate deep into the brain, damaging cell communication. Roger Coghill, an independent research scientist and a member of the Department of Health's UK mobile telecommunications health research programme, said: \"A criminal could not have come up with a better system. They couldn't have chosen a better frequency with which to disarm and debilitate the very forces that are trying to secure their arrest.\" Alasdair Philips, an expert on the biological effects of electromagnetic radiation and director of the campaign group Powerwatch, said Tetra had the potential to become the \"next asbestos\". \"It is beyond belief that any one could be contemplating the rollout of a system like Tetra because of the evidence about the dangers of pulsed frequencies,\" he said. \"To design a communications system based on these principles is mind numbing. The effects we may see could well be on a par with Gulf war syndrome.\" Last year, Sir William Stewart's report on mobile phone safety concluded that systems modulating at frequencies around 16Hz should be \"avoided if possible in future developments of signal coding\". Since then the Home Office has ordered reviews of existing research on Tetra while insisting that rollout of the new system goes ahead as planned. But the scientists say existing research is inadequate because the tests have only been carried out on animals and human tissue but not on humans. \"I'm currently involved in some research but all this should have been done years ago,\" Mr Philips said. \"The net result is that the police are guinea pigs.\" Low-frequency electromagnetic radiation was identified as far back as the 1960s as a potential anti-personnel weapon when the superpowers began conducting experiments into non-lethal \"mind control\" devices.",

Asghar Samarbakhsh blamed police for allowing 25,000 people into the Sari stadium, meant to accommodate 15,000. \"All those on the roof were without tickets,\" he said. AP, Sari Liberians angry at UN sanctions Thousands of Liberians took to the streets of Monrovia again yesterday in protest at UN sanctions imposed on the country for fuelling war in west Africa.

The 18-month trial in Kings Cross, an inner city area notorious for prostitution and drug dealing, will aim to cut the country's drug overdose deaths, which have soared from six in 1964 to 958 in 1999. Since it was proposed two years ago, the injecting room has attracted criticism from local people, the Australian prime minister and the Pope, who sent a letter forbidding the Sisters of Charity order to run the centre, where nurses provide supervision and sterile equipment for addicts to inject drugs. An Aboriginal elder lodged a complaint with the Land Titles Office last Friday, claiming that the $A500,000 (\u00a3185,000) injecting room was close to an indigenous burial ground. Uniting Care, the charity running the centre, has 21 days to respond. The controversial trial was originally intended to involve several other shooting galleries, but two court challenges and divided public opinion led New South Wales's Labor government to support a single centre. The NSW premier, Bob Carr, whose brother died from a drug overdose, and the police have backed the project, which is funded by money confiscated from convicted drug dealers. The local chamber of commerce, which lost a Supreme Court challenge to the injecting room last month, claimed the centre was already exacerbating drug use in Kings Cross. \"As of the last 24 hours there's been an enormous increase in the number of drug addicts and dealers in this area,\" its spokesman Paul Haege said.

But whereas that book was principally a tale of struggle and heroism, the second will have to delve in to the murky world of wielding power if it is to achieve anything like the same success. The new book can be expected to deal with Mr Mandela's fractious relationship with the man who set him free, former president FW de Klerk. Mutual respect between the two Nobel peace prize winners quickly diminished, not least because Mr Mandela came to believe that the white regime was perpetuating violence in black townships as part of its negotiating strategy. Through all of this, Mr Mandela's marriage was falling apart as not only were Winnie's misdeeds laid bare but she refused to drop her boyfriend. The book will also be a defence of Mr Mandela's presidency which some in the ANC say was too strong on reconciliation and weak on reform. Critics say President Thabo Mbeki believes the Mandela government was one of missed opportunities, particularly to undertake a greater redistribution of wealth in the early days of the new South Africa. Among the most timely insights Mr Mandela can offer - if he chooses - will be about Mr Mbeki. The former president secretly favoured another candidate to be his deputy and anointed Cyril Ramaphosa. Mr Mbeki won the day with the party. The government recently named Mr Ramaphosa as one of three anti-apartheid politicians under investigation for an apparently non-existent plot to oust Mr Mbeki.",

But following a distinguished teaching career, he began to exhibit again after almost 40 years, and the British Museum, in particular, recognised the innovative quality of his monotype prints.</p> <p>Born in London of a Russian father and English mother, Kashdan grew up in straitened circumstances. At the age of 12, he decided to become an artist, but then had to leave school at 14. Attending evening classes at a working men's institute led to the suggestion that he apply to the Royal Academy schools.</p> <p>In 1935, he visited Paris and painted in northern France. A compensation payment from an accident enabled him, at last, to start at the Royal Academy schools in 1936. As a first-year student, he won the RA gold medal and travelling scholarship, which he used to spend the summers from 1936-39 in the south of France.</p> <p>The works he painted after moving to Cambridge in 1943 showed the influence of Picasso and Bracque, as well as that of Juan Gris, whose work he had seen in the collection of his friend Gustav Kahnweiler. Kashdan painted mainly still lifes, demonstrating his interest in design and colour construction, while his Artist And Model series of paintings were more exuberant, with flamboyant colour and bold use of line. Kahnweiler's encouragement resulted in him getting his first exhibition, at the Redfern gallery, London, in 1945.</p> <p>He had many literary friends, and an interest in theatre led to puppet theatre becoming a subject of some paintings and prints, and, later, to the use of dramatic improvisation as a vehicle for teaching in art schools.</p> <p>Kashdan used to visit Henry Moore's studio regularly. He was impressed by the simple abstract shapes of Moore's early sculpture, and by his Shelter Sketchbooks, published during the war. Moore brought Kashdan's work to the attention of James J Sweeney, of the Museum of Modern Art, New York.</p> <p>Another artist friend was Richard Ziegler, a German refugee also living in Cambridge. Ziegler, who had known Paul Klee in Germany, had developed his own print-making process using transfer drawing and duplicator paper to make editions of his prints. The freedom of expression he achieved impressed Kashdan, who evolved his own techniques to make monotypes, or unique impressions on paper.</p> <p>Kashdan produced a great variety of monotype prints in the 1940s and 1950s, often combining the classic monotype technique of D\u00e9gas with a form of offset drawing similar to that pioneered by Klee and Ziegler. He also experimented with a method of etching on acetate and a simple form of screenprinting.</p> <p>Klee's work was a strong influence, and Kashdan met Jankel Adler, a close associate of Klee. In 1946, he was invited to send about 50 monotypes for exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, and showed this portfolio to Adler before the prints were dispatched to New York. Adler was impressed, and introduced Kashdan to Robert Colquhoun, Robert MacBryde and John Minton. Kashdan's monotypes, and the techniques he had developed, had a strong effect on Colquhoun and MacBryde, who began to make their own monotypes.</p> <p>Adler's main pursuit was what Michael Middleton has called the quest \"to bring the human figure within a post-Cubist, post-Expressionist framework\". Like Adler, Kashdan used archetypal, and even grotesque, figures and faces to represent universal images of the suffering of the war years.</p> <p>He had also encountered the work of the Mexican popular artist Posada, whose tendency towards caricature and whose bizarre visions of grinning skeletons bedecked with striking hats and clothes were echoed in Kashdan's monotype series of Nocturnal Heads and Insect Women, in which he portrayed sinister figures of the night derived from Kafka's Metamorphosis, and savagely caricatured society women as beetles with glittering shells.</p> <p>Postwar relief was tempered by pessimism - there was shock at the revelations of wartime atrocities, and anxiety about the atom bomb. Kashdan felt progressively less interested in being part of what he called \"the gallery scene\". His mood and work had become dark, intense and brooding, highly charged with grief and drama.</p> <p>His monotypes and drawings were exhibited in 1947 at the Art Institute of Chicago and, in 1948, at the Philadelphia Art Alliance. From 1948 to 1950, he continued to exhibit in mixed exhibitions in London and Cambridge. But he then decided to withdraw from public exhibitions, and concentrate on teaching.</p> <p>Kashdan had moved to Devon in 1946 to take up a teaching post and launch an art department at the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth. An articulate and inspiring teacher, he moved to the Guildford School of Art in 1951, and to Epsom School of Art in 1972, remaining there until retirement in 1982.</p> <p>In 1989, his first one-man exhibition for almost 40 years - a retrospective of paintings and monotypes from 1940 -55 - was held at the England &amp; co gallery, in London. The British Museum's department of prints and drawings recognised the significance of this missing link in the history of British printmaking, and acquired a substantial collection of his work.</p> <p>Some were later included in the major exhibition (and book of the same title), Avant-Garde British Printmaking 1914-60, at the British Museum in 1990. In 1991, Kashdan held a second exhibition at England &amp; co of monotypes from 1941-91.</p> <p>He leaves his second wife, Marthe, and three sons and daughter from his first marriage.</p> <p>\u0095 John Kashdan, painter and printmaker, February 12 1917; died February 22 2001</p>",

Moore brought Kashdan's work to the attention of James J Sweeney, of the Museum of Modern Art, New York. Another artist friend was Richard Ziegler, a German refugee also living in Cambridge. Ziegler, who had known Paul Klee in Germany, had developed his own print-making process using transfer drawing and duplicator paper to make editions of his prints. The freedom of expression he achieved impressed Kashdan, who evolved his own techniques to make monotypes, or unique impressions on paper. Kashdan produced a great variety of monotype prints in the 1940s and 1950s, often combining the classic monotype technique of D\u00e9gas with a form of offset drawing similar to that pioneered by Klee and Ziegler. He also experimented with a method of etching on acetate and a simple form of screenprinting. Klee's work was a strong influence, and Kashdan met Jankel Adler, a close associate of Klee. In 1946, he was invited to send about 50 monotypes for exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, and showed this portfolio to Adler before the prints were dispatched to New York. Adler was impressed, and introduced Kashdan to Robert Colquhoun, Robert MacBryde and John Minton. Kashdan's monotypes, and the techniques he had developed, had a strong effect on Colquhoun and MacBryde, who began to make their own monotypes. Adler's main pursuit was what Michael Middleton has called the quest \"to bring the human figure within a post-Cubist, post-Expressionist framework\". Like Adler, Kashdan used archetypal, and even grotesque, figures and faces to represent universal images of the suffering of the war years. He had also encountered the work of the Mexican popular artist Posada, whose tendency towards caricature and whose bizarre visions of grinning skeletons bedecked with striking hats and clothes were echoed in Kashdan's monotype series of Nocturnal Heads and Insect Women, in which he portrayed sinister figures of the night derived from Kafka's Metamorphosis, and savagely caricatured society women as beetles with glittering shells. Postwar relief was tempered by pessimism - there was shock at the revelations of wartime atrocities, and anxiety about the atom bomb. Kashdan felt progressively less interested in being part of what he called \"the gallery scene\". His mood and work had become dark, intense and brooding, highly charged with grief and drama. His monotypes and drawings were exhibited in 1947 at the Art Institute of Chicago and, in 1948, at the Philadelphia Art Alliance. From 1948 to 1950, he continued to exhibit in mixed exhibitions in London and Cambridge. But he then decided to withdraw from public exhibitions, and concentrate on teaching. Kashdan had moved to Devon in 1946 to take up a teaching post and launch an art department at the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth. An articulate and inspiring teacher, he moved to the Guildford School of Art in 1951, and to Epsom School of Art in 1972, remaining there until retirement in 1982. In 1989, his first one-man exhibition for almost 40 years - a retrospective of paintings and monotypes from 1940 -55 - was held at the England &amp; co gallery, in London. The British Museum's department of prints and drawings recognised the significance of this missing link in the history of British printmaking, and acquired a substantial collection of his work. Some were later included in the major exhibition (and book of the same title), Avant-Garde British Printmaking 1914-60, at the British Museum in 1990. In 1991, Kashdan held a second exhibition at England &amp; co of monotypes from 1941-91. He leaves his second wife, Marthe, and three sons and daughter from his first marriage. \u0095 John Kashdan, painter and printmaker, February 12 1917; died February 22 2001",

The Mass takes up the whole of the Evening Concert (9.0pm, Classic FM). The personal life of another German philosopher, Immanuel Kant, was as far from Nietzsche's man of action as one can get. His neurotically ordered routine enabled his neighbours to set their watches by his daily constitutional. Not surprisingly, the author of The Critique of Pure Reason has come down to us as a bodiless shadow who passed his entire life in contemplation. However, Richard Coles discovers in Night Waves (9.30pm, Radio 3) that Manfred Kuehn's new biography paints a very different picture, filling out the human detail that is absent from most history books.",

      "body": "<p>\u0095 If all the media stories predicting what the Labour government would do if it won the election were true, it would, I've calculated, need a legislative programme 17 years long. One of the more persistent, though always nebulous, stories around is that the prime minister intends \"waging war\" (almost always the phrase used) against fat-cat lawyers. But let's look a little deeper into that. The really fat cats do not trouble the public purse. We don't know exactly, because they don't reveal their tax returns to the media, but there's general agreement that there are around 20 barristers, perhaps a few more, who earn more than a million pounds a year. A few dozen more may be in the half-million-plus range. Almost without exception, they operate in the areas of law to do with commerce, finance, tax and the like. Their clients tend to be large corporations or other wealthy enterprises, and, occasionally, rich individuals. Their fees are high because their clients can afford them. Very rarely are they paid with taxpayers' money. I can't believe that it's the government's intention to interfere with agreements reached in the free market not involving public funds. There are, it's true, some QCs who earn a lot from legal aid, usually because they've been involved in one or two very long and complex criminal or family cases. The lord chancellor has already taken steps both to reduce their exaggerated fees and to restrict their presence in cases in which they're not necessary. It's possible that the government plans to open up the bar to more competition, as outlined by a recent Office of Fair Trading report; but that would hit ordinary, thin barristers far more than it would touch the incomes of the stout. The fact is that the fat cats against whom Blair Wars is allegedly going to be waged are few in number; any new initiative will make only a very small difference to the national bill for legal services. But it is good for a government to be seen to be bashing lawyers, even if the grounds for it are flimsy.</p> <p>\u0095 There was a lot of lawyer-bashing, too, last week, following the May Day demonstrations. A couple of newspapers took exception to the probability that the police will be facing many claims for compensation over their tactics and conduct during the final, Oxford Circus phase of the demos. The Daily Mail also focused on the fact that a number of solicitors' firms were standing by to give legal advice and handing round their business cards. But what is wrong with that, provided, of course, the potential client is not taken for a financial ride by the lawyers and gets competent help and advice? Now Alan Milburn, the health secretary, has jumped on to the band-wagon, objecting to adverts by solicitors' firms in hospitals alerting patients to the possibility that they may have a legal claim. Again, I ask, what is the harm done? To whom? Lots of people land up in hospital because someone has committed a wrong against them, for instance, injured them by negligent driving. Many others are victims of clinical negligence by doctors or the hospitals themselves. I cannot see the objection to telling injured patients that they may have a legal right to compensation, and informing them of a law firm that might help. I will return to the subject soon, with particular reference to the misuse of the description \"ambulance chasers\".</p> <p>\u0095 It's sad that I was a little surprised at Jack Straw doing the right thing in the criminal justice world. I was not alone in fearing that, when Sir David Ramsbotham's lively stint as chief inspector of prisons came to an end, he would be replaced by someone likely to be, shall we say, a little less forthrightly critical of the state of our prisons. The appointment of Sir David himself in 1995 was viewed suspiciously as an attempt to put in place someone more amenable to Home Office policy and the prison service than Sir Stephen Tumim had been. It didn't take long for Ramsbotham to prove his doubters wrong. He was fearless, robust and plain-speaking, often making prison officialdom and personnel very cross. So we were kind of expecting his successor to be a more shadowy, more establishment, less challenging figure. Not a bit of it. Anne Owers, currently director of Justice, is an inspired choice. She will be as firm and courageous as her predecessors - and as fair, paying tribute where due. Jack Straw could presumably have blocked her appointment in favour of someone more timid. He didn't, which is to his credit.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u0095 If all the media stories predicting what the Labour government would do if it won the election were true, it would, I've calculated, need a legislative programme 17 years long. One of the more persistent, though always nebulous, stories around is that the prime minister intends \"waging war\" (almost always the phrase used) against fat-cat lawyers. But let's look a little deeper into that. The really fat cats do not trouble the public purse. We don't know exactly, because they don't reveal their tax returns to the media, but there's general agreement that there are around 20 barristers, perhaps a few more, who earn more than a million pounds a year. A few dozen more may be in the half-million-plus range. Almost without exception, they operate in the areas of law to do with commerce, finance, tax and the like. Their clients tend to be large corporations or other wealthy enterprises, and, occasionally, rich individuals. Their fees are high because their clients can afford them. Very rarely are they paid with taxpayers' money. I can't believe that it's the government's intention to interfere with agreements reached in the free market not involving public funds. There are, it's true, some QCs who earn a lot from legal aid, usually because they've been involved in one or two very long and complex criminal or family cases. The lord chancellor has already taken steps both to reduce their exaggerated fees and to restrict their presence in cases in which they're not necessary. It's possible that the government plans to open up the bar to more competition, as outlined by a recent Office of Fair Trading report; but that would hit ordinary, thin barristers far more than it would touch the incomes of the stout. The fact is that the fat cats against whom Blair Wars is allegedly going to be waged are few in number; any new initiative will make only a very small difference to the national bill for legal services. But it is good for a government to be seen to be bashing lawyers, even if the grounds for it are flimsy. \u0095 There was a lot of lawyer-bashing, too, last week, following the May Day demonstrations. A couple of newspapers took exception to the probability that the police will be facing many claims for compensation over their tactics and conduct during the final, Oxford Circus phase of the demos. The Daily Mail also focused on the fact that a number of solicitors' firms were standing by to give legal advice and handing round their business cards. But what is wrong with that, provided, of course, the potential client is not taken for a financial ride by the lawyers and gets competent help and advice? Now Alan Milburn, the health secretary, has jumped on to the band-wagon, objecting to adverts by solicitors' firms in hospitals alerting patients to the possibility that they may have a legal claim. Again, I ask, what is the harm done? To whom? Lots of people land up in hospital because someone has committed a wrong against them, for instance, injured them by negligent driving. Many others are victims of clinical negligence by doctors or the hospitals themselves. I cannot see the objection to telling injured patients that they may have a legal right to compensation, and informing them of a law firm that might help. I will return to the subject soon, with particular reference to the misuse of the description \"ambulance chasers\". \u0095 It's sad that I was a little surprised at Jack Straw doing the right thing in the criminal justice world. I was not alone in fearing that, when Sir David Ramsbotham's lively stint as chief inspector of prisons came to an end, he would be replaced by someone likely to be, shall we say, a little less forthrightly critical of the state of our prisons. The appointment of Sir David himself in 1995 was viewed suspiciously as an attempt to put in place someone more amenable to Home Office policy and the prison service than Sir Stephen Tumim had been. It didn't take long for Ramsbotham to prove his doubters wrong. He was fearless, robust and plain-speaking, often making prison officialdom and personnel very cross. So we were kind of expecting his successor to be a more shadowy, more establishment, less challenging figure. Not a bit of it. Anne Owers, currently director of Justice, is an inspired choice. She will be as firm and courageous as her predecessors - and as fair, paying tribute where due. Jack Straw could presumably have blocked her appointment in favour of someone more timid. He didn't, which is to his credit.",

      "body": "<p>Sidelines must protest at the recent glut of couples who feel that it is the world's duty to sit meekly and observe while they trumpet \"We love each other THIS MUCH!\" at varying pitches of hysteria. First was that pair who took the unnecessary step (geddit?) of getting married during the London Marathon, as though clogging up the streets with a margarine brand on your chest were something to be proud of - and not only that, but sexually aroused by to boot (geddit again?). Now we're presented with Fiona and Mike Thornewill, who at the weekend became the first married couple to walk to both Poles. Oh super. Love is a limitless journey of self-discovery and mutual exploration, of course, it goes without saying, but haven't these people heard of intercourse? Or going to the cinema in the afternoon, then getting drunk until it's time to go home? There is something unnerving about such eagerness to Do Stuff Together. And it reminds Sidelines of the word \"wholesome\", never a happy event.</p> <p>Flowers, on the other hand, are so happy, they're delirious. According to research undertaken by the University of New Jersey, receiving flowers as a gift is most likely to have a long-term positive effect on mood. The study examined the responses of women aged 22 to 90 to receiving gifts, one of which was a bouquet. But note, if you will, the other items that were delivered to participants: a scented candle and a basket of fruit. No wonder blooms came up trumps. The candle assumes that you're the kind of woman who genuinely desires to spend hours in the bath, festering in your own dirty water, with one painted toenail up the tap, secretly fretting about the cotton content of your bed linen. The bowl of fruit will sit gathering dust until all the pears get ripe and go off at once, in the space of an hour (which may pass while you are asleep). I'd rather take the cash.</p> <p>Finally, I am most distressed that nobody has expressed any interest in witnessing the execution of this column. Sidelines wrote to a selection of global media outlets, offering them the once-in-a-lifetime chance to watch me sitting in my chair, but nobody responded. Apparently, they'd all gone to the circus.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sidelines must protest at the recent glut of couples who feel that it is the world's duty to sit meekly and observe while they trumpet \"We love each other THIS MUCH!\" at varying pitches of hysteria. First was that pair who took the unnecessary step (geddit?) of getting married during the London Marathon, as though clogging up the streets with a margarine brand on your chest were something to be proud of - and not only that, but sexually aroused by to boot (geddit again?). Now we're presented with Fiona and Mike Thornewill, who at the weekend became the first married couple to walk to both Poles. Oh super. Love is a limitless journey of self-discovery and mutual exploration, of course, it goes without saying, but haven't these people heard of intercourse? Or going to the cinema in the afternoon, then getting drunk until it's time to go home? There is something unnerving about such eagerness to Do Stuff Together. And it reminds Sidelines of the word \"wholesome\", never a happy event. Flowers, on the other hand, are so happy, they're delirious. According to research undertaken by the University of New Jersey, receiving flowers as a gift is most likely to have a long-term positive effect on mood. The study examined the responses of women aged 22 to 90 to receiving gifts, one of which was a bouquet. But note, if you will, the other items that were delivered to participants: a scented candle and a basket of fruit. No wonder blooms came up trumps. The candle assumes that you're the kind of woman who genuinely desires to spend hours in the bath, festering in your own dirty water, with one painted toenail up the tap, secretly fretting about the cotton content of your bed linen. The bowl of fruit will sit gathering dust until all the pears get ripe and go off at once, in the space of an hour (which may pass while you are asleep). I'd rather take the cash. Finally, I am most distressed that nobody has expressed any interest in witnessing the execution of this column. Sidelines wrote to a selection of global media outlets, offering them the once-in-a-lifetime chance to watch me sitting in my chair, but nobody responded. Apparently, they'd all gone to the circus.",

Here the romantic painter Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix lived in a house that has since been converted into a museum. It's a lovely spot to visit in the Parisian spring, with a quiet blossoming garden and a delightful atelier. Admittedly the painting we've come to see concerns a mother about to stab her children to death in order to enrage her husband, but it's still a pleasant outing. </p> <p>The exhibition M\u00e9d\u00e9e Furieuse (Furious Medea) brings Delacroix's still shocking painting of the murderous demi-god of a sorceress to Paris for the first time in ages. It's been moved from Lille to the Mus\u00e9e National Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix in Paris to be hung in his atelier in a fine historical exhibition that displays studies for and later versions of the work. </p> <p>The exhibition is well timed. Paris has been awash in Medea studies since Isabelle Huppert brought her Avignon festival production of Euripides' play to the French capital recently. There's even a Medea musical. </p> <p>The 1838 canvas, which outraged and entranced the salon of the same year, is the centrepiece of this exhibition. It's flanked by two versions Delacroix painted for rich people shortly before his death in 1863. </p> <p>Delacroix had a thing about breasts. You can see that in the proud bosom of Liberty Leading the People (at the Louvre), or in the remarkable embonpoint of one woman in The Death of Sardanapalus (Louvre also). But M\u00e9d\u00e9e Furieuse, while maintaining the breast fixation, is less vividly coloured and less deliriously composed than such works. For his first mythological subject Delacroix became restrained, classical and reminiscent of the other leading French painter of his day, Ingres. Intriguingly, in the preparatory drawings for M\u00e9d\u00e9e Furieuse, the heads of her two children cover her breasts as though they were taking a suck for one last time before she dispatches them. In the final painting, however, the children's heads slump below her bosoms and are half throttled by their mother's arm. We catch the terrified eye of one child looking directly at us. While Medea's right arm holds the pair tight, the left hand clutches a dagger. </p> <p>It's a wonderful gesture - at once maternally protective and unnaturally brutal. We see Medea's profile as she looks out of her cave in panic; she might almost be a protective mother holing up from some unseen threat. But in fact she is the threat - the wild animal - and her panic surely concerns what she is about to do. </p> <p>Better yet, the sun is penetrating the cave, leaving only the top of Medea's head in shade. In Delacroix's painting, the line between dark and light races diagonally from an inch up her noble nose to the tip of her ear, making her look like a helmeted warrior - a female Achilles overwhelmed by ruthless rage. A fantastic painting. </p> <p>\u0095 M\u00e9d\u00e9e Furieuse is at the Mus\u00e9e National Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix in Paris (01 44 41 86 50) until July 30.</p>",

Perhaps the team was about to go to pieces. </p> <p>But Il Messaggero had nothing to say about the explosive situation in Verona's dressing room. Instead the paper was concentrating all its attention on another dysfunctional family: in the small northern town of Novi Ligure, a 16-year-old girl and her boyfriend had stabbed to death the girl's mother and younger brother. \"She was a completely normal and very charming girl,\" said the next-door neighbour. </p> <p>Perversely, even this horrendous story did not dissolve my dreamy pre-match state of mind.

The fans of Verona and Lazio have what the Italians call a gemellaggio, a friendship arrangement. Could this be because both groups are considered racist? As a result, I was fearlessly wearing my yellow-blue scarf and Hellas hat, something that would have been madness were we playing AS Roma, whose more politically correct hooligans are famous for their knife attacks on the buttocks of opposing supporters. Now someone was asking me: \"Do you know where our section is?\" He too had a blue and yellow scarf, but he seemed morose, in need somehow. We set off together. Who would have thought that this glum man was about to confirm my dumb reflection that football might be a solution to all kinds of family crises? </p> <p>\"Bound to lose today,\" I tried. \"So hardly worth worrying about it.\" </p> <p>\"Oh, it's not that.\" </p> <p>\"Best we can hope for is that Brescia and Vicenza lose too.\" </p> <p>\"Right.\" </p> <p>We crossed the Lungotevere to the huge monolith raised to Mussolini Dux. Rome is the one town in Italy where you feel the arrogance of power weighing down on you. Everything is on a grander scale. No chance for Hellas, I repeated to myself. </p> <p>At the end of the first half it was 2-0. Need I say to Lazio? Marco, my new acquaintance, had hung on beside me but said very little. There was a fierce tension about the man. He was well dressed, in his early 30s, had a pleasant, open face, but seemed angry. We were all angry, of course. With Perotti, our coach, and with the players. But he seemed angry with himself. He wasn't shouting. </p> <p>Despite inevitable defeat, the spirit of the fans had been festive at first. We were enjoying being in this fantastically dramatic stadium, enjoying the warm welcome of the Lazio fans who roared out, \"Vi salverete\" - you won't go down - to console us after they scored. Some of them even had Hellas flags. Then news came through that the bulk of our supporters, in a couple of coaches, had been turned back by the police because they were drunk. To protest at this needless piece of cruelty - after all, there was absolutely no danger of violence at today's game - the chant leaders insisted that we all sit down and stop singing. </p> <p>\"Merda, merda, merda,\" Marco said. </p> <p>As soon as we sat down, the team started performing. Only moments into the second half, our tiny Argentinian, Camoranesi, scored with a stunning volley from the edge of the box. Immediately Lazio got another. But amazingly Verona seemed to have taken over the game. They were doing all the attacking. The referee was the notorious Pierluigi Collina, the shaven-headed emblem of total authority. To be true to his iron-grip image, something he clearly works hard at, he suddenly and quite unexpectedly sent off the mild-mannered Martino Melis, Verona's left half. Melis had been given a yellow card in the first half for a foul from behind. Now Lazio had a free kick in midfield. Melis was about five yards off the ball and walking away. Collina blew his whistle. Melis half turned. The ball struck him. Collina immediately showed him a second yellow card and sent him off. </p> <p>That did it. Marco suddenly snapped out of his gloom. His whole attitude changed. He was on his feet, kicking the steps, yelling abuse. \"They're scared of us!\" An improbable scenario. All the same, down to 10 men, Verona scored at once. Three-two. </p> <p>The fans were now torn between the need to protest about police harassment and the desire to support the team. People kept jumping up and sitting down. Lazio scored another. Apparently it was over. But Perotti brought on the huge striker Michele Cossato, a man who hardly ever gets a game, and 10 minutes later he scored his first goal in Serie A. Four-three. Five minutes from time, Lazio keeper Marchigiani just touched a free kick round the post. Oh, we were so close to equalising! In the final seconds Lazio got a lucky fifth. Game over. </p> <p>Throughout all this excitement Marco had been quite wild, and now, when the police prevented us from leaving, he grew even wilder. What possible reason could there be for keeping us, he demanded? We were twinned with Lazio. But the police were adamant. They kept us there an hour. When finally we got to the gates we were met by a mob of cheering Lazio boys eager only to swap scarves. \"I've missed my fucking train,\" Marco groaned. </p> <p>I too had time to kill, so we sat in a bar and he told me his story. Married with two children, he had planned to use the excuse of the away game in Rome to start an affair. He had met a woman at a conference recently. In any event, he had booked into a hotel last night and asked her out to dinner. She had a boyfriend but had sold the man some excuse. They had had a very intimate meal, then walked for a bit around the Piazza di Spagna. \"But when it was time to invite her up to the hotel room, I didn't somehow.\" </p> <p>Marco had then spent half the night and all of this morning eating his heart out over the wonderful sex he had passed up. He was convinced she was on for it. He couldn't understand why he hadn't been more decisive. \"When I saw you on the bridge I was feeling like a complete fool.\" </p> <p>But now he felt great. </p> <p>\"Why?\" </p> <p>\"Don't know. It was the game. All that excitement. I thought we played pretty well, actually. I mean, you can't expect to win at the Olimpico. Che bastardo, Collina! But just being there, it's incredible. What a stadium. When the game ended, I just wanted to get home as soon as possible. That's why I was so furious with the police. Feel really glad now that I didn't do anything. You know the mess you get into if you start something with a woman.\" </p> <p>\"Nothing like\" - I shook my head - \"the mess Hellas are in.\" </p> <p>His face clouded over. \"What chance next week against Atalanta?\" </p> <p>Already we were wiring ourselves up, two family men on our second beer.</p>",

Mr York staggered out into the street in Trowbridge, Wiltshire, to alert a passerby.</p> <p>Police said the brothers, Jason and Timothy Seviour, who knew the murdered woman and her friend, were being sought in connection with the attack.</p> <p>Detective Chief Inspector Norman McKeaveny issued a warning that the brothers were violent and should not be approached by the public. \"Their behaviour is unpredictable, and they are urged to come and talk to us,\" he said.</p> <p>\"It is believed the two suspects were friends with the victims. At this stage we don't know what the reason for this attack was.\"</p> <p>Police said there had been no signs of a forced entry into Mr York's house and no obvious signs of a struggle.</p> <p>Forty police officers were carrying out a fingertip search for the murder weapon and conducting house to house inquiries.</p> <p>Ms Hartley was pronounced dead at the scene. Mr York was taken to Royal United hospital in Bath, where he was in a \"comfortable\" condition last night.</p> <p>At a press conference at Trowbridge police station, Mr York's mother, Christine, said her son and Ms Hartley \"were just good friends\" and had lived in the same street all their lives.</p> <p>They had come back from a drink in town and had gone for a Chinese takeaway, then got a taxi home.</p> <p>\"My son was nearly killed. Our families have been close friends for years. Liz was part of me,\" Mrs York said.</p> <p>\"I got a phone call saying my son had been rushed to hospital and that I should get there as soon as possible. I don't know why anyone would want to attack them.\"</p> <p>Ms Hartley, who leaves two young children, is understood to have been estranged from her husband and is better known locally as Lizzie Cooper.</p> <p>Her sister, Teresa Cooper, sobbed at the press conference, saying: \"She was only 22.\"</p> <p>A neighbour, Janet Shergold, said: \"I have known the Coopers during the 20 years they had lived in the same street.

      "bodyText": "Police launched a hunt for two brothers yesterday after a young mother was murdered and her friend seriously injured. Elizabeth Hartley, 22, was stabbed to death at the home of her friend Kevin York, 34, who suffered chest wounds in the attack on Sunday night. Mr York staggered out into the street in Trowbridge, Wiltshire, to alert a passerby. Police said the brothers, Jason and Timothy Seviour, who knew the murdered woman and her friend, were being sought in connection with the attack. Detective Chief Inspector Norman McKeaveny issued a warning that the brothers were violent and should not be approached by the public. \"Their behaviour is unpredictable, and they are urged to come and talk to us,\" he said. \"It is believed the two suspects were friends with the victims. At this stage we don't know what the reason for this attack was.\" Police said there had been no signs of a forced entry into Mr York's house and no obvious signs of a struggle. Forty police officers were carrying out a fingertip search for the murder weapon and conducting house to house inquiries. Ms Hartley was pronounced dead at the scene. Mr York was taken to Royal United hospital in Bath, where he was in a \"comfortable\" condition last night. At a press conference at Trowbridge police station, Mr York's mother, Christine, said her son and Ms Hartley \"were just good friends\" and had lived in the same street all their lives. They had come back from a drink in town and had gone for a Chinese takeaway, then got a taxi home. \"My son was nearly killed. Our families have been close friends for years. Liz was part of me,\" Mrs York said. \"I got a phone call saying my son had been rushed to hospital and that I should get there as soon as possible. I don't know why anyone would want to attack them.\" Ms Hartley, who leaves two young children, is understood to have been estranged from her husband and is better known locally as Lizzie Cooper. Her sister, Teresa Cooper, sobbed at the press conference, saying: \"She was only 22.\" A neighbour, Janet Shergold, said: \"I have known the Coopers during the 20 years they had lived in the same street. We have always got on well with the Coopers and the Yorks. They are both decent families.\" Police urged anyone spotting the brothers, who are also from Trowbridge, to dial 999 or call the Wiltshire force on 01380 722341. Jason Seviour, 22, was described as white, 5ft 6in, of medium build, clean shaven with short fair hair and scarring to the right side of his face. He was wearing a dark baseball jacket. Timothy, 20, was described as white, 6ft 1in, of medium build, with short fair hair and blue eyes and wearing similar clothing. Neither brother can drive, so they were expected to have used a taxi or other means of transport to leave the area.",

Last month, UK utility Powergen agreed a \u20ac8.2bn takeover bid from E.ON but Powergen owns a utility in the United States - LG&amp;E - where regulations require any non-utility shareholdings in E.ON to be cut to below five percent. \u0095 Retail therapy is losing its allure as shoppers opt to spend more on trips abroad or eating out, according to a report released today (tues). Average income is on the up but little of this extra cash is being spent on clothing or furniture as people become bored with going to the shops. Retail consultancy Verdict said many high-street chains now face a challenging future unless they can inspire customers to come to their local store. Just below one-third - 32.9% - of all consumers' spending goes on the retail sector today, compared to 47% in 1980. Verdict chairman Richard Hyman said: \"There are now lots of other things we can spend our money on now compared to ten to 15 years ago and retail is losing out as a result of that. \"Retail sales are not diminishing, they are not going backwards, but they are growing very slowly, more slowly than its costing these companies to stay open.\"",

But the government has been dragging its feet.\"</p> <p>The association's fears echo those put by the Public Utilities Reform Group and the main water union, Unison, to the environment select committee this year. The reform group said it was concerned the trend towards using specialist contractors could lead to another Railtrack.</p> <p>Unison also questioned the benefits of the proposed changes: \"We have serious concerns that they are based on the interest of bonds markets and owners, rather than a rational appraisal of the benefits to customers. The concept of these new ownership structures contracting out their operations to five or six main contractors and many more subcontractors might make the safety issues of Railtrack problems look small.\"</p> <p>In its draft water bill, the government proposes to introduce more competition into the industry. There are 10 monopoly network operators in England and Wales which supply water and run the sewage systems in the areas they serve.</p> <p>Under new plans, companies will be able to compete both to supply a \"common carriage\" network of pipes and to retail water to customers, while existing water companies remain monopoly network operators.</p> <p>The CA says the draft water bill has flaws. It is sceptical that the benefits of introducing common carriage competition will outweigh the costs of implementing it.</p> <p>Consumers in rural areas and those on low incomes could be hit with higher prices - some bills could rise by more than half - as companies cherry-pick the most lucrative customers, the CA warns. Cross-subsidies, which ensure everyone pays the same for their basic water needs, could unravel.</p> <p>The water industry was privatised in 1989, and since then around \u00a334bn of capital investment has been spent on services and environmental improvements. But the improvements have been paid for by consumers.</p> <p>According to the environmental audit committee, consumers' water bills have risen on average 36%, and sewage bills have risen 42% in real terms, in the 10 years since privatisation. The cost of capital is the single biggest cost and accounts for about one-third of consumers' water bills.</p> <p>As privatised monopolies, the water companies are regulated by Ofwat, which decides how much companies need to spend on the network and then how much they can charge. In the first price review, the water companies put in what are now regarded as hugely inflated estimates of what they needed to spend to deliver services. They significantly underspent and tended to delay investment until the end of the price period.</p> <p>Private company profits rose 147% in the seven years after privatisation. Accusations of excessive profits and fatcat salaries coincided with droughts and water rationing in the 1990s. The regulator responded by imposing substantial price cuts in his 1999 price review, about 12.5% on average.</p> <p>Now the companies are facing lower financial returns and shares have been trading at about 25% less than the value of assets as assessed by the regulator. The system of 26 integrated water companies is unravelling with corporate changes and proposed restructuring.</p>",

The concept of these new ownership structures contracting out their operations to five or six main contractors and many more subcontractors might make the safety issues of Railtrack problems look small.\" In its draft water bill, the government proposes to introduce more competition into the industry. There are 10 monopoly network operators in England and Wales which supply water and run the sewage systems in the areas they serve. Under new plans, companies will be able to compete both to supply a \"common carriage\" network of pipes and to retail water to customers, while existing water companies remain monopoly network operators. The CA says the draft water bill has flaws. It is sceptical that the benefits of introducing common carriage competition will outweigh the costs of implementing it. Consumers in rural areas and those on low incomes could be hit with higher prices - some bills could rise by more than half - as companies cherry-pick the most lucrative customers, the CA warns. Cross-subsidies, which ensure everyone pays the same for their basic water needs, could unravel. The water industry was privatised in 1989, and since then around \u00a334bn of capital investment has been spent on services and environmental improvements. But the improvements have been paid for by consumers. According to the environmental audit committee, consumers' water bills have risen on average 36%, and sewage bills have risen 42% in real terms, in the 10 years since privatisation. The cost of capital is the single biggest cost and accounts for about one-third of consumers' water bills. As privatised monopolies, the water companies are regulated by Ofwat, which decides how much companies need to spend on the network and then how much they can charge. In the first price review, the water companies put in what are now regarded as hugely inflated estimates of what they needed to spend to deliver services. They significantly underspent and tended to delay investment until the end of the price period. Private company profits rose 147% in the seven years after privatisation. Accusations of excessive profits and fatcat salaries coincided with droughts and water rationing in the 1990s. The regulator responded by imposing substantial price cuts in his 1999 price review, about 12.5% on average. Now the companies are facing lower financial returns and shares have been trading at about 25% less than the value of assets as assessed by the regulator. The system of 26 integrated water companies is unravelling with corporate changes and proposed restructuring.",

His Northern &amp; Shell company has found three buyers for the magazines, which include adult titles such as Asian Babes and Forum, and a sale should go through within three months. The news is a public relations coup for the publishing tycoon, who is desperate to shake off his \"porn baron\" reputation and put the titles on the block at the beginning of the year. A spokeswoman for Northern &amp; Shell confirmed the imminent sale, but declined to name the buyers or reveal a price for the deal. \"Three companies have been short-listed, and are being subjected to due diligence procedures. Northern &amp; Shell are at the stage where they are simply choosing the buyer,\" said a spokeswoman for Northern &amp; Shell. It is understood that Mr Desmond has offered the stable of magazines to several overseas businesses. The magazines are owned by Mr Desmond's Portland Investments and Fantasy Publications companies, but his money-spinning adult Fantasy Channel will not be included in the sale. The continued presence of the Fantasy Channel in the Northern &amp; Shell group could scupper Mr Desmond's plans to float his publishing empire, which is valued at \u00a3500m. City advisers will think twice about associating themselves with a company which still has links with the porn business. Mr Desmond has also been forced into a sale for financial reasons, with Portland's latest accounts showing that the magazines lost \u00a3870,000 in 1999, and Fantasy Publications lost \u00a3815,000 in the same year. Analysts have suggested the titles may fetch up to \u00a320m. Last year's \u00a3125m acquisition of the Daily Express, the Sunday Express and the Daily Star from United Business Media was financed by a \u00a397m loan from Commerzbank, sparking a cost-cutting spree at Northern &amp; Shell. The publisher of OK! magazine is following the lead of porn tycoon David Sullivan, who recently gave away his adult titles after complaining that the porn publishing business was past its sell-by-date.

      "bodyText": "US music giant Launch Media has shelved plans to launch a British version of its website. Launch.co.uk had already recruited staff and was looking for a European partner to inject cash into the venture. But sources say the UK launch has now been postponed indefinitely due to market conditions and the eight staff will lose their jobs. They include chief executive Dominic Hardisty, who was previously operations director at the Financial Times, and two senior editors, Jim Irvin and Jenny Bulley, who were poached from Emap's Mojo last year. It has been suggested the Nasdaq-listed Launch Media might have another crack at Europe should conditions improve. But the company is now concentrating its energies on reigniting investor confidence in its flagship site, Launch.com, after shares sunk below the $1 mark last month. At its peak two years ago, Launch Media's shares were priced at $25. The news will add to the woes of the already depressed internet music business, which has found it difficult to make users pay for services and downloads. United Business Media has been looking for a buyer for its internet music operation, dotmusic since November last year.",
