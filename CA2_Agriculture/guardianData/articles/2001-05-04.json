      "body": "<p>Max Hastings started writing life early, leaving university after a year to the join the London Evening Standard , and publishing his first book when only 21. But he had not always wanted to be a writer. \"I went through a phase in my teens when I thought that I'd like to be a soldier. Luckily I discovered before it was too late that I wasn't cut out for that at all.\" In his memoir, Going to the Wars , he explains how, as a Territorial on a punishing exercise in Cyprus, he committed the cardinal sin of buying water, and then not offering it to those around him. His father, the war correspondent Macdonald Hastings, had expected Max to follow in his footsteps (\"he used to urge me to write something in the school holidays\"), and it may have been that which, initially, put him off. \"A lot of my family for three generations had been writers. I think I probably was not terribly sure whether I was going to be good enough to live up to the family reputation.\" </p> <p>For several years, during which he travelled to 60 countries and covered 11 wars for the BBC and the Standard , writing took second place to the sheer excitement of being a \"fireman\", a journalist sent to hotspots (there is a Barry Fantoni cartoon which shows one Nicaraguan saying to another, \"Things must be bad amigo. I think I just saw Max Hastings\"). There were books of reportage on civil rights in the US and on Ulster, which he regards without much pride: \"I go to great lengths nowadays to prevent any of my friends getting hold of them if they didn't read them at the time\". The experience of war corresponding from Israel, Saigon, Biafra, Rhodesia seemed \"as about as exciting a life as one could possibly ask for, but I often blush at how naive a lot of the stuff I did as a fireman was. It may have got on the front pages, but I'm not sure how much it added to the sum of human knowledge.\" </p> <p>Having written a biography of the Marquis of Montrose, Charles I's lieutenant-general in Scotland, Hastings acquired a taste for the \"long-researched\" book, and so he jumped at the chance when commissioned by George Weidenfeld to write a biography of Yoni Netanyahu, the Israeli officer killed leading the successful raid on Entebbe, Uganda, in 1976 which freed 103 Israeli hostages from a plane hijacked by Palestinian terrorists. The success of the book which followed, Bomber Command , re-ignited his passion for writing military history and helped him to stick, for the moment, to his resolution to stay away from war corresponding. \"The first book I'm still proud of, and which did have a real success, was my book on the bomber offensive . . . I think most of us have to learn how to do it.\" </p> <p>It was at this point, when established \"as a reasonably successful journalist, and a reasonably successful writer\", that he had what he calls his \"fantastic stroke of fortune\". In 1982, the Falklands were invaded and a taskforce dispatched, and Hastings became \"absolutely obsessive about wanting to go, even though I had given up that kind of foreign corresponding some years before, after the fall of Saigon. And I believed that if I could go, I could do something that would be very important, to me\". He travelled to the Falklands as the Standard 's correspondent, but he was also the most experienced print journalist, so his copy was often reproduced in other newspapers. One act, however, made him part of the story itself: \"I'll never forget looking up the road from the British lines in Port Stanley on the last day of the war and thinking, if I can walk up that road and get there first and survive and not get shot, I can bore everybody to death for the next 20 years talking about it.\" It was an act of typical bravado, driven, he freely admits, by \"pure, naked ambition\", and he is equally sure that without it, \"I don't think for a moment I would have become editor of the Daily Telegraph or editor of the Evening Standard \". </p> <p>One of the few things he misses now is spare time to write those \"long-researched\" books. \"Most people engaged simply in journalism have a moment of self-disgust at some point, when they wonder whether what they are doing is really worth the candle because of its utterly ephemeral nature. </p> <p>\"For God's sake, how many editors are remembered for five minutes after they have stopped editing? And rightly so. But you can kid yourself that writing books gives one a millisecond longer in people's recollections. I get enormous pleasure, when about once a month I get a letter from a reader about something I wrote in a book 20 years ago.\" </p> <p>He has to satisfy his literary energies by taking an active interest in the Standard 's books pages, which, he says, \"have always tended to operate a notch above the intellectual level of the rest of the paper. I enormously admire the way that David Sexton [the literary editor] has maintained that tradition, as AN Wilson did before him. I'm always poking around there, and I think one of the things David probably finds, or all literary editors who work for me have found a considerable strain, is that I rely on them to help me with my literary education. I try and make sure that they put on my desk anything they think I ought to read.\" </p> <p>He knows that people don't expect \"anyone who can admit that he enjoys the novels of GA Henty\" to be a reader of Proust, but it seems entirely in character for the man who, while sheltering behind a boulder during the Yom Kippur War, got out his copy of Middlemarch.</p>",

His hands were still shaking. \"Time for a Scotch.\" The last party of the 50s in DC was in full swing. \"Meet Frank Renzo,\" Charlie said to his wife, Mary. \"He's a reporter from New York.\" Mary smiled and went upstairs to watch her children as they lay sleeping. \"I really am the happiest woman in the world,\" she thought. A few days later the phone rang. It was Frank. \"I'm writing a feature on embassy life. I'd like to take you to lunch.\" \"I'll need to check,\" Mary countered. \"If ever you're in New York, I'd be happy to show you round,\" Frank announced casually over a coffee. It had been the most amazing three days in Manhattan. \"Check out Kind of Blue,\" smoothed Frank. \"Nice,\" Mary replied. She hesitated. \"You are the most remarkable man.\" \"I love you, too,\" he answered as their lips met. \"We mustn't,\" she sighed, pressing herself tighter to him. \"You're right,\" he groaned, cupping her breasts in his hands. \"Donchew worra bout me,\" slurred Charlie, as he washed down a fistful of barbiturates and Tylenol with a half-bottle of Scotch. \"I've got bad news,\" said Frank, pulling Mary close. \"John Coltrane's split from Miles Davis. Oh, and I'm not going to be able to see you so often. I've been put on the Kennedy election campaign trail.\" \"I won't be able to see you for a while, either,\" she replied, her eyes moistening. \"My mother's dying of cancer, and I must fly back to London to be with her.\" At least the separation will give us plenty of pages to reflect on their angst. \"I'm being posted to Moscow to brief the embassy on the new president,\" said Charlie, his whole body trembling. \"Bad news, Mrs van der Linden,\" barked a Foreign Office official. \"Your husband's had a breakdown. We need you to bring him back from Moscow.\" \"I love you so much, Charlie,\" Mary cried, as her husband came out of the psychiatric hospital. \"You'd better go back to Washington to close up the house,\" he replied. \"I love you so much, Frank, I'll stay in the US.\" This was even tougher than Guadalcanal. \"I love you, too,\" he said. \"But you must go back to London.\" \"I've changed my mind,\" he sobbed, as her plane flew overhead.

We know how Byron, Shelley, his wife Mary and her step-sister Claire Clairmont sat out that miserable July in 1816, but what of John William Polidori, Byron's secretary, who stumbles after them? Andahazi introduces Pollydolly to Annette Legrand, who proposes a simple exchange: she will write a novel to rival Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, he provides her with a vital fluid. The result of Andahazi's bargain plunges easily into the Romantic sensibility, while holding fast to a modern wit. </p> <p> <strong> Jitterbug Perfume</strong><br>Tom Robbins <br>(No Exit, \u00a37.99)<br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501193905,00.html\">Buy it at a discount at BOL</a><br></p> <p> This is the sort of pseudo-mystical, intricate novel that one intense adolescent slips to another as a kinship offering. It's a fictionalised Golden Bough with sub-plots set in a Paris perfume manufacturer's, a mysterious New Orleans apothecary's and a Seattle restaurant. The unifying threads that pull this sprawling saga together are beetroot, Robbins's sassy one-liners, the search for immortality, a blue glass bottle, and a convoluted treatise on perfume and desire.

We know how Byron, Shelley, his wife Mary and her step-sister Claire Clairmont sat out that miserable July in 1816, but what of John William Polidori, Byron's secretary, who stumbles after them? Andahazi introduces Pollydolly to Annette Legrand, who proposes a simple exchange: she will write a novel to rival Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, he provides her with a vital fluid. The result of Andahazi's bargain plunges easily into the Romantic sensibility, while holding fast to a modern wit. Jitterbug Perfume Tom Robbins (No Exit, \u00a37.99) Buy it at a discount at BOL This is the sort of pseudo-mystical, intricate novel that one intense adolescent slips to another as a kinship offering. It's a fictionalised Golden Bough with sub-plots set in a Paris perfume manufacturer's, a mysterious New Orleans apothecary's and a Seattle restaurant. The unifying threads that pull this sprawling saga together are beetroot, Robbins's sassy one-liners, the search for immortality, a blue glass bottle, and a convoluted treatise on perfume and desire. Robbins has an enviable gift for creating an ever-entertaining read that teasingly promises far more insight than it reveals.

Otherwise, what do you get? Moody cat-and-mouse exchanges between cons and police, rain-sodden council estates, endless dull accounts of duller drug deals enlivened by gaudy splashes of comic-book violence. In other words, a ready-made landscape that soon becomes as cosy and trite as any village green or suburban semi. </p> <p>For Nick Barlay, whose \"loose people of a loose trilogy\" make their final appearance in Hooky Gear , one senses that the fear of falling into clich\u00e9 is a major motivation. Rarely does one read writing so inventive, yet so tensed against habituation; so exuberant, but so obsessed with the business of conveying depression, hopelessness and failure. As this trilogy has progressed, one has been aware of Barlay's talent both enlarging and relaxing, and with his finale, the riskiest of all three in terms of its style, one sees a writer really coming into his own. </p> <p>\"Look at the futality [sic] of your situation,\" a mate urges J, the novel's dubious hero, and that about sums up what the reader is forced to do throughout. From the moment J and his accomplice Duane are interrupted in the middle of a burglary on the Haringey Ladder, we're aware that things are not going well on the \"High Road to the Big Coin\". By the time J has been turned over to the police by his wife Monica, abandoned by Uncle, the shadowy Mr Big of the piece, and spent nine months in Wormwood Scrubs, we've cottoned on to the fact that they're going to get worse; and when a newly freed J begins to mount his convoluted revenge on all his betrayers, we realise that \"worse\" might be very bad indeed. </p> <p>What elevates Barlay from the crowds of undistinguished caper-writers is an extraordinary facility for creating and sustaining individual voices; in Crumple Zone for realising the edgy anxieties of teacher Cee Harper, and here for conveying the swaggering anecdotage and the blunted intelligence of J. \"Understand I got a wife an kids an in a way a whole empire and I'm a king an hittin 30 years,\" he tells us. \"But sometime a king must prove all over how he got to be a king.\" So J is delivered to us a self-mythologising petty criminal, a garrulous domestic imperialist. </p> <p>The obvious fact is that J isn't a king - nor even a prince in Uncle's bloodthirsty, oblique kingdom. He's a pawn, albeit a pawn with a nice sense of interior d\u00e9cor, the hooky gear of the title: \"My antiques - hooky; carpet - hooky; domestic appliances - hooky; toys an childrenwear - hooky; duvets an general beddin - hooky. Etc. etc. etc. an so forth. Well I got connections an that's how it is wha can I say? You dont need no intelligence to act.\" </p> <p>With an entire narrative delivered in this unpunctuated, hardcore demotic, it takes great skill to ensure that it never becomes gimmicky or irritating. Conversely, its energy requires of the reader an immense concentration, an alertness to the gaps between what appears to be being said and what is actually going on, and a pleasurable surrender to an unexpected form of articulacy. With its broken-down sentences, free-flowing dialogue and apparent formlessness, this is a brilliantly literary novel, utterly absorbed by the connections between experience and expression, and between language and morality. As the tale trundles on to its downbeat end ing, via crosses and double-crosses at Tilbury Docks, we are left in little doubt as to the unrecuperable sadnesses of J's life, standing in the tattered ruins of his existence. </p> <p>Barlay started his writing career at the X Press, the small independent firm which was also responsible for first publishing Victor Headley. Barlay and Headley have both moved on to the large grazing pastures offered by bigger corporations, a change that Headley makes a curious deal out of in the afterword to his new novel, Off Duty . The X Press, he claims, encouraged him to \"write three 'Yardie' novels a year, get paid and don't worry about the rest!\" The reverse logic of moving to a larger publisher in order to ensure greater creative freedom is somewhat perplexing, and indeed, Off Duty doesn't immediately appear to break new ground. </p> <p>What we are given is a lusty thriller split between Kingston, Jamaica, in the early 1980s, when the connections between politics and gangster politicking saw a speedy escalation in violence and turf warfare, and London in the mid-1990s, to where many of the protagonists have relocated. Headley's story involves the efforts of a Jamaican detective, Carlton Nash, to track down the killers of his former boss and brother-in-law Rico Glenford, whom we see gunned down on a London street at the start of the novel. </p> <p>The plot's ingredients are promising: a narrator who has been on both sides of the law and now finds himself frustratingly sidelined by his temporary residence in an alien country; an intriguing back story, thickened with semi-dormant antagonisms and collusions; and a straight- forward murder mystery. But although Headley remains committed to that plot - driving it forward by a combination of reve lations and blind alleys - Off Duty is let down by the slackness and inattention of its prose. A fatal fascination with the exclamation mark, clunking clich\u00e9s and contrived scene-setting all make this a peculiarly bloodless affair, its potentially forceful themes of corruption and redemption never quite given the air they need. Neither Nash nor Glenford are strong enough characters to carry a whole novel; J, on the other hand - well, we could have an entire trilogy about him.</p>",

Sinclair's early work - the parklife grimoire of Lud Heat , the genre-defying bestiary of White Chappell, Scarlet Tracings - is haunted by the death of the 60s dream: all it could have been, and failed to secure. In the 70s, running his own Albion Press, Sinclair resisted the easy lure of beanbag metaphysics and found thornier corridors to crawl. He risked derisive laughter with his talk of star charts over Greenwich and Osiris reborn in Limehouse, so got his retaliation in first, wisping a fine skein of self-mockery around his wilder theories. But there was no denying the ritual charge: when you read these books, you \"knew\" you had been somewhere. </p> <p>It is important to state just how key Sinclair was for many of us, at a certain point in the 80s, as a prickly alternative to the dully polished hegemony of Amis, Barnes et al. A true Anglo revelation: the sentences jumped like Ellroy or Vollmann, but the patrimony was Blake, Dee, De Quincey. Sinclair texts were like internet sites before the fact, full of links for the interested reader to follow. (I wasn't the only one to trace the spinal curvature of Hawksmoor's churches, Lud Heat in one hand, A-Z in the other.) Flip over Sinclair Magus and you found a taxonomist: from Lud Heat to Lights Out For The Territory , he built up an alt.rolodex of contemporary mystics and mummers. He may have masked his journalist heart behind a gibbous saloon-bar persona - quizzical, sarcastic, bamboozled - but Iain was strolling the avant-garde perimeter before Charles Saatchi knew what a \"concept\" was. No one else did such a good job of keeping in touch with the margins. It's not overstating the case to say that Sinclair kept the hopes of a certain culture alive. </p> <p>Which makes the task of navigating his new work all the more depressing. Landor's Tower is being pushed as the big follow-up to Lights Out For The Territory - his \"bestselling\" essay-suite on subcult London - and this alone seems to have put him on the defensive. Landor's Tower is all paranoid asides and sighing disclaimers which, taken together, spell out a weary \"wish I wasn't here\". Sinclair is strung out on an insanely self-pitying tic: his Narrator can't eat breakfast or pick up a paperback without stepping back to comment on how boring and distasteful it is to have to turn such things into literature. Landor's Tower is less a novel than a series of manic-depressive Post-It notes from the author to himself, reminders never to do this again. </p> <p>Plot? The boorish Narrator has been commissioned to do a book on obscure mystic Walter Savage Landor (which hardly squares with Sinclair's bleak view of a purely profit-based books world). On his grudging travels, he meets a dark and deeply allegorical woman called Prudence. There's a sexual charge here which might have taken, if the narrative weren't riven with all this pratfall stuff, unfunny funny business about books and dogs and dope. The only thing Sinclair seems truly to engage with as a topic is Hay-on-Wye, which is set up, not once but an unbelievable and unendurable twice, for the topographical equivalent of character assassination. Sinclair ends up lost in the kind of prissy book-world \"goss\" he previously held in contempt, settling such petty in-house scores that it will signify only to half-a-dozen subcult bores. It baffles me why Sinclair cares about this stuff, or thinks that we will. </p> <p>Narrative urgency might have overridden the more extreme unlikelihoods (beneficent publishers? aesthete policemen?), but Sinclair never picks a fever dream to follow and Landor's Tower fails to forge a self-contained Gothic symmetry. He can hardly bear to be on the same page as half his characters - conspiracy fruits and service-station nuts who barely open their mouths before being consigned to a cartoon oblivion consonant with their cartoon names. The narrative is measured in miles from home; he itches to be back in London. What there is of a plot, he's done better before: secret-state shadowplay was the icily humorous domain of Radon Daughters while the bookdealers-go-wild-in-the-country thing was nailed, definitively, in White Chappell . </p> <p>This is a work of palpable disenchantment; magical realism, only without the magic. The spell hasn't taken: the evoked demons blank the Magus. Sinclair is tapping the table among all this babble, trying to relocate his own lost voice. There is a hint of that voice in the book's final section, where things finally feel innate rather than forced. Here are the only passages worthy of other Sinclair books: a melancholy meditation on family inheritance, and a vivid and genuinely moving portrait of a utopian community felled by the changing cultural seasons. Sinclair's sentences finally gain a recognisable shape and force; images perplex and startle; the text's heart jumps into meaty life. You want to know more about this Sinclair, his Wales, his \"interior\" journey, its fearful darkness standing out against the flippancy and spite of the most part. You want to know more because finally, it seems, so does he. </p> <p>He is also on the money about the move west: various romancers slouching towards Bristol, the Channel, Wales. A return to soil magick, sea dreams, golden dawns; rendered by the Sinclair of old, this western noir could have shone like a dark midnight sun. Here, transcribed as if by a peculiarly bitchy and self-alienated amanuensis, it reads like any other work of London hi-lit snobbery. Which is not the Sinclair I know, or read, or want to read. Sinclair Magus, please return.</p>",

Can this team do that? What if this happens or what about a shock there?\" he says. </p> <p>\"Sometimes you think to yourself: 'Yeah, we're going to be all right, the others are the ones really in the shit' and then other times you can see it going the other way, the worst-case scenario. </p> <p>\"It's constantly on your mind. People talk about restless nights but, to be honest, I'm tiring myself out thinking about it so much that I'm having no problems getting off to sleep. By the end of the day I'm usually worn out. </p> <p>\"What has been annoying is that the weather's been so bloody awful that I've hardly had a chance to relax. When I need to get away from things I normally get into the garden but it's been almost impossible this year.\" </p> <p>Two more defeats and the suspicion persists he may have plenty more time for pruning the roses next season. Lionel Pickering, the Derby chairman, is hardly known for his tolerance and Smith is realistic enough to know that the murmurs of discontent around the city - one local radio station ran a newsflash in October saying he had been sacked - would be displaced by voluble dissent if they were to be demoted. </p> <p>It is a prospect he does not want to entertain but one conversation with Pickering, at a time when the local phone-ins were crackling with caustic animosity, inspires hope. \"Stick with it Jim,\" the chairman told him. \"Because when you go, I go.\" </p> <p>If all goes according to plan, Smith wants at least another year before relinquishing his duties, with his assistant Colin Todd being primed for the step up. For it to be taken out of his hands, at this stage of his nomadic career, would be a grubby way to bow out. </p> <p>\"I'm trying not to think about it that way, but every manager in this situation knows that, yes, there could be a final twist in the tale and the possibilities of what could happen if the wheels did come off. </p> <p>\"If the worst does happen, I would obviously have to sit down with the chairman and discuss what we wanted to do. But, for the moment, that's all been left in abeyance until the end of the season. We're trying to be positive rather than negative and I would certainly rather be in our position than in Manchester City's or Coventry's.\" </p> <p>Nevertheless these are uneasy times. It has been a tempestuous season and, given Derby's predicament, the popular picture of Smith puffing an elephantine cigar could be the inspiration for a Hamlet advert. </p> <p>In mitigation, the 60-year-old could argue that only Everton and Leeds have had a comparable injury list while only Southampton have spent less. </p> <p>Yet Smith, an alumnus of the old school, is not one for rattling off convenient excuses. \"The simple fact is that we have tossed away too many careless points, shot ourselves in the foot too many times and missed too many golden opportunities to get to 41 points and safety,\" he says. </p> <p>Today, as he does every match day, Smith will take with him a handkerchief his father Jimmy gave him 42 years ago for good luck. He has read that Gordon Strachan has a \"plan B\" ready in case Coventry take the drop but he has not reached that stage yet. As he says: \"There is only one plan . . . pray!\"</p>",

When I need to get away from things I normally get into the garden but it's been almost impossible this year.\" Two more defeats and the suspicion persists he may have plenty more time for pruning the roses next season. Lionel Pickering, the Derby chairman, is hardly known for his tolerance and Smith is realistic enough to know that the murmurs of discontent around the city - one local radio station ran a newsflash in October saying he had been sacked - would be displaced by voluble dissent if they were to be demoted. It is a prospect he does not want to entertain but one conversation with Pickering, at a time when the local phone-ins were crackling with caustic animosity, inspires hope. \"Stick with it Jim,\" the chairman told him. \"Because when you go, I go.\" If all goes according to plan, Smith wants at least another year before relinquishing his duties, with his assistant Colin Todd being primed for the step up. For it to be taken out of his hands, at this stage of his nomadic career, would be a grubby way to bow out. \"I'm trying not to think about it that way, but every manager in this situation knows that, yes, there could be a final twist in the tale and the possibilities of what could happen if the wheels did come off. \"If the worst does happen, I would obviously have to sit down with the chairman and discuss what we wanted to do. But, for the moment, that's all been left in abeyance until the end of the season. We're trying to be positive rather than negative and I would certainly rather be in our position than in Manchester City's or Coventry's.\" Nevertheless these are uneasy times. It has been a tempestuous season and, given Derby's predicament, the popular picture of Smith puffing an elephantine cigar could be the inspiration for a Hamlet advert. In mitigation, the 60-year-old could argue that only Everton and Leeds have had a comparable injury list while only Southampton have spent less. Yet Smith, an alumnus of the old school, is not one for rattling off convenient excuses. \"The simple fact is that we have tossed away too many careless points, shot ourselves in the foot too many times and missed too many golden opportunities to get to 41 points and safety,\" he says. Today, as he does every match day, Smith will take with him a handkerchief his father Jimmy gave him 42 years ago for good luck. He has read that Gordon Strachan has a \"plan B\" ready in case Coventry take the drop but he has not reached that stage yet. As he says: \"There is only one plan . . . pray!\"",

But even by those standards today's fare looks remarkable. </p> <p>In Hertfordshire this afternoon unfolds the mother of all relegation battles. Barnet, 24th and bottom of the Third Division, take on Torquay, 23rd. Tonight one of them will no longer be a league club. Barnet need a win, Torquay a point. Little wonder Barnet's director of football John Still has given his players relaxation tapes. Impossible Dream they are entitled. </p> <p>This, though, is more the unbearable nightmare. Not even a lorryful of aromatherapy oils and a team of masseurs could make relaxation an easy exercise. The Conference, which awaits the country's worst league side, is seen as football's equivalent of the Gulag. </p> <p>It was 10 years ago yesterday that the then manager Barry Fry danced across the pitch at Fisher to embrace Flashman as Barnet, after several near misses, finally escaped the chill of non-league football. Returning from whence they came is a daunting prospect for the club, particularly as the league may not let them back up unless they find a new ground. Underhill does not meet the 6,000 capacity requirement and the dispensation Barnet have to stay while they seek a new site would no longer apply. </p> <p>\"I can't explain how it feels,\" says Barnet's longest-serving player Warren Goodhind. \"It's the biggest game of the season. People might say, 'What about the FA Cup final?' But if you lose a final you know the next season you'll have another chance. We're playing for our careers. We're playing for the right to call ourselves professional footballers.\" </p> <p>No one at Barnet can believe it has come to this. In November, amid great excitement, Still moved upstairs to make way for Tony Cottee. The former England striker's first home game as player-manager brought a 7-0 win over Blackpool and took Barnet to eighth. Talk was of making the play-offs for the third time in four seasons. Relegation seemed as likely as buying Rivaldo. </p> <p>Yet by mid-March Cottee had resigned amid crumbling results (11 points from 19 matches) and dipping morale. A 3-2 defeat at Blackpool last Saturday - Barnet's 15th consecutive away defeat - left the club bottom for the first time. The chairman Tony Kleanthous had seen Cottee as the \"final piece in the jigsaw\" to win promotion. Instead everything fell apart. </p> <p>\"We had been very much a team,\" says Still, who is likely to move back upstairs and make way for a new manager. \"If you broke it down, people might say, 'He's not the best player and he's not the finest'. But we were a good team, fit and organised. We had a saying: 'If they can't break our spirit, they can't beat us.' </p> <p>\"But that spirit and togetherness went completely. When I came back, I asked the players what they felt the problems were. They told me they thought they were lacking fitness and organisation. They didn't really feel they had been given the right coaching work, the right development work.\" </p> <p>As dressing-room respect for Cottee diminished and the club tumbled down the table, a change was proposed: Still would take charge for the rest of the season, with Cottee staying as a player and starting afresh in July. Cottee felt his position untenable and signed for Millwall. \"We will know on Saturday,\" says Kleanthous, \"whether we acted too late.\" </p> <p>Kleanthous, a 35-year-old millionaire internet entrepreneur, in his seventh year as chairman, does not blame Cottee, whose debut shirt still hangs in the club offices. With hindsight he admits appointing a novice manager with no Third Division experience was an error but he prefers not to look back. Everything is focused on this afternoon and his nerves are transparent. \"Mind if I smoke?\" he asks. \"Ten cigarettes at the same time.\" </p> <p>After ploughing millions of pounds and countless hours into the club Kleanthous feels \"empty\" at the thought it could all go to waste. Barnet lose around \u00a3500,000 a year and he is unsure whether they could sustain a likely doubling of that with relegation. \"It's always in the back of my mind but we haven't sat down and looked at it because we don't want to. It's not the time for that.\" </p> <p>Barnet, who won their last home game 3-0 against Rochdale, seem quietly confident. Yet many connected with the club feel angry their survival is in doubt when Chesterfield have been found guilty of irregularities. \"If they have been found guilty of cheating consistently they should be thrown out of the league,\" Still says. </p> <p>Then again Barnet have got used to disappointment. After winning promotion to the Second Division in 1993 the bulk of the team left after the league upheld their claim that their contracts had been breached and were not valid. Instant relegation followed. </p> <p>Since 1996 Barnet have spent considerable energy seeking a new ground because redeveloping Underhill - on a greenbelt site - seems impossible. A proposed move to Copthall was rejected at a public inquiry and leaving the borough may be the only option. </p> <p>Today, though, only survival matters. In 1996 Torquay finished bottom and were reprieved because the ground of the Conference champions Stevenage was not up to scratch. This time there will be no let-off for the 92nd club.

      "body": "<p>Almost a year to the day after announcing plans to demutualise and pay windfalls to members, Friends Provident this week finally unveiled full details of precisely who's getting what and when. </p> <p>The company, founded by Quakers and now one of Britain's biggest mutual life insurers, intends to float on the stock market on July 9, triggering a multi-billion pound summer shares giveaway. </p> <p>It is proposing to give all its 1.7m qualifying members a fixed handout of 200 shares each, which based on its own figures would be worth around \u00a3500. Just over a million of these people hold with-profits policies and they will also get a variable allocation of shares which could in theory range from just one to several thousand shares. Windfalls of several thousand pounds won't be uncommon. </p> <p>The company sent out information packs to members this week. Here we answer some of the likely questions: </p> <p> <strong> So how much will I get?</strong> </p> <p> The share allocation statement being sent out will tell you how many shares you're getting. It will depend on what sort of member you are. If you're an eligible member of Friends Provident Life Office (see later) but your policy is not with-profits, you will get a fixed handout of 200 shares. These are likely to be worth between 225p and 270p each when it floats, so 200 shares would have a value of \u00a3450-\u00a3540. </p> <p>If you're one of the 1.1m members with a with-profits policy (such as a pension plan or endowment) you will also get a variable handout of shares. How many you get will depend on the size of the policy and how long you have held it. For example, a man with a with-profits pension who was 40 when he took it out and has paid in \u00a350 a month over the past 15 years is likely to receive a total of 1,700 shares with an estimated value of around \u00a34,207. An endowment policy-holder who was 30 when it was taken out and has paid in \u00a350 a month for 20 years could expect 2,650 shares with an estimated value of \u00a36,558. </p> <p><strong> When will I get my windfall?</strong> </p> <p> When the company floats on the stock market on July 9, which will happen provided at least 75% of those members who vote say yes. The packs being mailed out include voting forms which must be returned by June 4. Or you can vote in person at the special meeting in London on June 6. </p> <p> <strong> You mentioned this business about membership of Friends Provident Life Office. What's all that about?</strong> </p> <p> To be a member, you must have a Friends Provident Life Office or UK Provident policy which you held on May 4 last year and which will still be in force on June 6 this year. UK Provident was a mutual insurer bought by Friends Provident in the mid-80s. </p> <p> <strong> I'm a policyholder with London &amp; Manchester, the insurer taken over by Friends Provident in 1998. Do I get a windfall?</strong> </p> <p> Sorry, you get nothing. </p> <p> <strong> I've bought a second-hand Friends Provident with- profits endowment policy. Do I get a windfall?</strong> </p> <p> Yes, probably. Friends Provident is seeking to amend its rules so that the original policyholder (ie, the seller) will get the fixed handout of 200 shares while the person who acquired the policy would get the variable allocation of shares. </p> <p> <strong> What are the tax implications?</strong> </p> <p> You won't get taxed on the shares unless you sell them. If you do, then provided the value of the shares sold together with any other capital gains realised is within the annual CGT exemption (currently \u00a37,500), you won't pay any tax. But if you receive a larger windfall - \u00a310,000 worth of shares, say - and you sell them, you will take the tax hit. </p> <p> <strong> Why is the company demutualising?</strong> </p> <p> It says listing on the stock market will provide it with increased financial strength and flexibility. </p> <p> <strong> Will it affect my policy?</strong> </p> <p> The company says there will be no adverse impact on policies, and the terms and conditions will not be affected. The benefits provided by becoming a public company \"should improve investment returns for with-profits policyholders over the long term\". </p> <p> <strong> Will I be able to sell my shares and take the cash instead?</strong> </p> <p> Yes. </p> <p> <strong> What do I have to do now?</strong> </p> <p> Fill in and send back the voting form by the deadline. And you can confirm membership details by checking and signing the voting form. </p> <p> <strong> What happens then?</strong> </p> <p> Assuming the demutualisation is approved, a prospectus and \"share election form\" will be mailed out to members from June 12. The form will ask you whether you want to keep your shares (and apply to buy extra shares at a discount if you wish) or sell them, and must be sent back by July 3. </p> <p> <strong> Where can I get more help?</strong> </p> <p> Log on to <a href=\"http://www.friendsprovident.com\">Friends Provident</a> or phone the helpline: 0845-070-1170. </p> <p><strong>Scottish Provident members in line for \u00a33,400</strong><br></p> <p>Scottish Provident plans to distribute windfalls averaging \u00a33,400 to members if they vote next month in favour of a sale to Abbey National. But payments are unlikely to be posted before the end of the year, the firm said this week. </p> <p>More than 440,000 Scottish Provident members will receive a flat payment of \u00a3500. With-profits policyholders can expect to see this figure boosted depending on how long they have held their policies and how much the policies are worth. </p> <p>The mutual insurer says members will be sent a circular next week with details of the formula needed to calculate their share of the \u00a32.1bn Abbey National is proposing to pay for the group. Some 300,000 customers with protection policies such as critical illness insurance are not considered members and miss out on windfalls. </p> <p>Despite worries that they are fearsomely complex, loan notes will be on offer instead of cash to policyholders with windfalls ex ceeding the annual capital gains tax limit of \u00a37,500. Members with several longstanding policies will be in line for more than \u00a3100,000. </p> <p>Joint policyholders, most of them with endowment policies linked to mortgages, will be sent a joint cheque which they must divide between themselves, the firm says. </p> <p>Scottish Life will also hand out \u00a3500 to its 220,000 members, but variable payments will be returned to policyholders in the form of an additional bonus. The firm is proposing to accept a \u00a31.1bn offer from Royal London, , a rival mutual insurer, rather than be taken over by a bank or float on the stock market, which would generate larger cash payouts. </p> <p>Only 70,000 life members will receive both flat and variable windfalls because endowment policyholders - the bulk of the membership - have been told their mortgage lender holds the membership rights.<br><strong>Phillip Inman</strong></p>",

The firm is proposing to accept a \u00a31.1bn offer from Royal London, , a rival mutual insurer, rather than be taken over by a bank or float on the stock market, which would generate larger cash payouts. Only 70,000 life members will receive both flat and variable windfalls because endowment policyholders - the bulk of the membership - have been told their mortgage lender holds the membership rights.

When Linda McCartney's will was published this week it showed that although she had left \u00a34m to her four children (much of it in trust), access was made difficult to encourage them to pursue their own careers first. </p> <p>Remarkably, Kate Turner, head of tax at Coutts, the private bank which targets clients with at least \u00a3500,000 in liquid assets, says that her clients often do not object to paying the tax. \"Either they simply do not mind paying it, or they are unwilling to leave money to their children because they feel they do not want to give them such a large headstart in life,\" she says. </p> <p>She adds that inheritance tax planning should start when the client is in their 40s, rather than leaving it until retirement age. </p> <p><strong>From play days to pay days</strong><br></p> <p>Some children would be big losers if inheritance was taxed at 100% or abolished.</p> <p><strong>Brooklyn Beckham</strong> can already lay claim to a high rolling lifestyle with an extensive designer wardrobe and upmarket toy collection. Posh and Becks' combined earnings of more than \u00a320m will also fill up his bank account.</p> <p><strong>Lucas Jagger</strong>, initially disowned by his father Mick after he was born to the Brazilian model Luciana Morad, should be able to claim a stake of the Rolling Stone's fortune. Mick's assets are estimated to total \u00a3150m. </p> <p>Elsewhere in the music industry,<strong> Lennon Gallagher</strong> should benefit financially from being the son of estranged parents Oasis star Liam Gallagher and actress Patsy Kensit. Oasis made \u00a360m in the past three years.</p> <p><strong> Anais Gallagher</strong> is in the same boat, except the father is Noel Gallagher and the estranged wife is party organiser Meg Matthews. </p> <p>Victoria Beckham's mate Scary Spice is also in the money. Her daughter<strong> Pheonix Chi Gulzar</strong>, is sole inheritor of the estimated \u00a315m fortune. </p> <p><strong> Arthur Donald, </strong> the grandson of Paul MaCartney, could be a rich man. Grandad is worth \u00a3500m. </p> <p><strong>How they get away with it</strong><br></p> <p>Here are the top 10 tips the wealthy need to know to avoid paying inheritance tax: </p> <p>1. The first \u00a3242,000 of any estate is free of inheritance tax (IHT). </p> <p>2. Agricultural land and business assets, unlike residential houses, are completely free of IHT. Farms, estates and companies can therefore be passed down between generations of families without the taxman seeing a penny. However, stringent rules exist to prevent the elderly rich snapping up a company prior to death to avoid duties. </p> <p>3. Potentially Exempt Transfers (Pets). Under the Pet rules, an individual can give assets away - such as cash, shares, antiques and oil paintings - which will not be counted for IHT as long as they are gifted seven years before the individual dies. Die within three years of the gift, however, and it will still be liable for IHT. If they meet their demise between three and seven years later, then a proportion of the amount counts. </p> <p>4. Houses cannot be transferred under Pet rules if the former owner continues to receive a benefit from the house, such as continuing to live there. But one adviser, Speechly Bircham (020-7427-6400), has found a way round the rules through its Home Loan Plan, where the homeowner sells it to a trust in return for an IOU. </p> <p>5. Transfers between spouses are completely free of IHT, before or at death. </p> <p>6. Discretionary trusts allow a family double use of the \u00a3242,000 allowance. Put simply, a husband dies and his \u00a31m estate is divided \u00a3758,000 to his wife and \u00a3242,000 to his children. No tax is paid. When his wife dies, the \u00a3242,000 allowance can then be used a second time. </p> <p>7. Annual and regular gifts from income are treated as free of IHT liability. The gifts - a maximum of \u00a33,000 per year - are not confined to family only and no matter when the person giving the gift dies, it will be exempt from IHT. </p> <p>8. Grandchildren can be given \u00a3250 a year without any IHT liability. There is no maximum number of gifts to grandchildren. </p> <p>9. When children marry, they can be given up to \u00a35,000 without incurring IHT. </p> <p>10. Donations to charities and political parties are free of IHT. </p> <p>\u0095 Information supplied by Mazars Neville Russell, Speechly Bircham and Jobs &amp; Money research </p> <p><strong>Patrick Collinson</strong></p>",

However, not all of the new rich believe that they should featherbed the future of their offspring. When Linda McCartney's will was published this week it showed that although she had left \u00a34m to her four children (much of it in trust), access was made difficult to encourage them to pursue their own careers first. Remarkably, Kate Turner, head of tax at Coutts, the private bank which targets clients with at least \u00a3500,000 in liquid assets, says that her clients often do not object to paying the tax. \"Either they simply do not mind paying it, or they are unwilling to leave money to their children because they feel they do not want to give them such a large headstart in life,\" she says. She adds that inheritance tax planning should start when the client is in their 40s, rather than leaving it until retirement age. From play days to pay days Some children would be big losers if inheritance was taxed at 100% or abolished. Brooklyn Beckham can already lay claim to a high rolling lifestyle with an extensive designer wardrobe and upmarket toy collection. Posh and Becks' combined earnings of more than \u00a320m will also fill up his bank account. Lucas Jagger, initially disowned by his father Mick after he was born to the Brazilian model Luciana Morad, should be able to claim a stake of the Rolling Stone's fortune. Mick's assets are estimated to total \u00a3150m. Elsewhere in the music industry, Lennon Gallagher should benefit financially from being the son of estranged parents Oasis star Liam Gallagher and actress Patsy Kensit. Oasis made \u00a360m in the past three years. Anais Gallagher is in the same boat, except the father is Noel Gallagher and the estranged wife is party organiser Meg Matthews. Victoria Beckham's mate Scary Spice is also in the money. Her daughter Pheonix Chi Gulzar, is sole inheritor of the estimated \u00a315m fortune. Arthur Donald, the grandson of Paul MaCartney, could be a rich man. Grandad is worth \u00a3500m. How they get away with it Here are the top 10 tips the wealthy need to know to avoid paying inheritance tax: 1. The first \u00a3242,000 of any estate is free of inheritance tax (IHT). 2. Agricultural land and business assets, unlike residential houses, are completely free of IHT. Farms, estates and companies can therefore be passed down between generations of families without the taxman seeing a penny. However, stringent rules exist to prevent the elderly rich snapping up a company prior to death to avoid duties. 3. Potentially Exempt Transfers (Pets). Under the Pet rules, an individual can give assets away - such as cash, shares, antiques and oil paintings - which will not be counted for IHT as long as they are gifted seven years before the individual dies. Die within three years of the gift, however, and it will still be liable for IHT. If they meet their demise between three and seven years later, then a proportion of the amount counts. 4. Houses cannot be transferred under Pet rules if the former owner continues to receive a benefit from the house, such as continuing to live there. But one adviser, Speechly Bircham (020-7427-6400), has found a way round the rules through its Home Loan Plan, where the homeowner sells it to a trust in return for an IOU. 5. Transfers between spouses are completely free of IHT, before or at death. 6. Discretionary trusts allow a family double use of the \u00a3242,000 allowance. Put simply, a husband dies and his \u00a31m estate is divided \u00a3758,000 to his wife and \u00a3242,000 to his children. No tax is paid. When his wife dies, the \u00a3242,000 allowance can then be used a second time. 7. Annual and regular gifts from income are treated as free of IHT liability. The gifts - a maximum of \u00a33,000 per year - are not confined to family only and no matter when the person giving the gift dies, it will be exempt from IHT. 8. Grandchildren can be given \u00a3250 a year without any IHT liability. There is no maximum number of gifts to grandchildren. 9. When children marry, they can be given up to \u00a35,000 without incurring IHT. 10. Donations to charities and political parties are free of IHT. \u0095 Information supplied by Mazars Neville Russell, Speechly Bircham and Jobs &amp; Money research Patrick Collinson",

      "body": "<p>There comes a moment in any televised awards ceremony when the cameras stop rolling and the assembled actors and directors head to the bar for a drink and a gossip. </p> <p>It's the moment when the presenter announces the awards for technical achievement, and the only way viewers at home get to find out who has won - or that the awards even exist - is if they happen to listen very carefully to the voiceover listing \"the winners in other categories\" as the closing credits run. </p> <p>There is precious little glamour for the technicians, designers, administrators, stage managers and box office staff who account for well over half of those working in live theatre, but the variety of their work means few would rather be employed anywhere else. </p> <p>There are as many different types of jobs as there are theatres. At a small theatre outside London, a deputy stage manager (DSM) could find him or herself doing everything from putting up the lights to bolting the scenery together; in a large West End theatre a DSM's role will be much more strictly defined. Similarly, a small theatre may only have a small complement of permanent staff and will take on contract workers and volunteers as and when they are needed, whereas a large venue will have a large permanent staff and will only rarely use freelances. </p> <p>Touring companies and houses, such as Glyndebourne, that are only open for six months of the year will tend to use more freelance and part-time staff. However, even armed with the relevant specialist training and qualifications getting the first job can still be an uphill struggle. </p> <p>\"I've been very lucky,\" says Sarah Alford-Smith, who is just coming to the end of her eight-month contract as DSM at the Worcester Swan Theatre. \"I've been in work ever since I graduated from the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School four years ago. Most jobs are got through word of mouth and by recommendation; I think I got my first job because someone rang up my theatre school to see if there was anyone who could fill a vacancy for assistant stage manager. I've also got jobs since then from adverts in The Stage and from the Stage Management Association freelist that gets circulated to theatres and producers.\" </p> <p>Many start their careers as a freelance, picking up contracts as and when they crop up. David Curl has been freelance for much of his 16 years in theatre, and is now stage manager for the musical Notre Dame de Paris at London's 2,000 seater Dominion Theatre. </p> <p>\"In this business you should budget for periods of unemployment, though I've worked solidly for the past six years or so,\" he says. \"I've built up a good network of contacts, and I've been well supported and looked after by the people I have worked with.\" </p> <p>Not every one may have such a smooth career path. </p> <p>\"These days there are more and more courses offering training qualifications for the theatre,\" says Mr Curl. \"I can't help feeling that as greater numbers of students graduate, a good many are going to be disappointed. There are only a finite number of jobs, and I've already begun to notice bottlenecks emerging. How can everyone progress from ASM up to DSM if there aren't the vacancies?\" </p> <p>What the recent increase in training courses has done, though, is to level the playing field between the sexes. Cathy Joyce is now 40 and has a permanent job as senior lighting technician for the Royal National Theatre (RNT). </p> <p>\"When I first came into the profession it was rare to find a woman working backstage on the technical side,\" she says. \"You had to go out of your way to be seen lifting the heaviest equipment to prove you could do the job. These days women are much more integrated into the industry.\" </p> <p>For most of her career Ms Joyce chose to work freelance as the money was far better. Not that she was talking untold riches, mind. The theatre is not the destination for those who want to get rich quick. </p> <p>An ASM on a big show might earn \u00a3350 per week, while a stage manager with 15 years' experience on the same show may only be on about \u00a3500. Box office staff may be on \u00a315,000 while craft grades, such as costume designers, can expect to earn \u00a320,000. </p> <p>The good news is that the industry has well-organised unions, Bectu and Equity, which are hot on issues of pay and health and safety. Bectu, which has just ended a dispute with the Royal Opera House (ROH) over the suspension of one of its members, has individual agreements with the national houses, a collective agreement with the West End Theatre, and a minimum levels of pay and conditions of employment in the English repertory sector. </p> <p>The less good news, though, is that many theatres are happy to stick to the minimum levels. And, says Willie Donaghy, Bectu's arts and entertainment supervising officer, he faces a constant battle with theatre owners that want to erode his members' rights. \"The Society of London Theatres has recently introduced proposals for greater casualisation, compulsory Sunday working, having the workforce on call 24 hours a day and for the abolition of permanent staffing levels,\" he says. </p> <p>Further pay cuts may be in the offing as the EU's 48-hour working week comes into force. \"My basic contract is for a 40-hour week,\" says Cathy Joyce, \"but I usually end up working at least 60 hours. The overtime pay is an important part of my salary, and as the directive is implemented I will be restricted in the hours I can work. The RNT management and the union are working hard to resolve this, but since the theatre will have to take on more staff to make up the deficit, it's hard to see how pay levels can stay the same.\" </p> <p><strong>Why it didn't end in tears for Dave</strong><br></p> <p>Dave Shea, 30, is a freelance technical manager working for several Scottish theatre companies. He is currently working on the restaging of Tron Theatre and the Royal National Theatre's collaborative production of Zinnie Harris' Further than the Furthest Thing at the Tricycle Theatre in London. </p> <p>\"When I started my A-level Theatre Studies course I was mainly interested in performing, but we had a particularly forceful teacher who was always trying to push us to the point of tears, and I wasn't prepared to go as far as he wanted. Added to this, most of the other students were women and it was usually left to me to put up the sets when we took a show into school, and I gradually came to realise I was happiest working on the other side of the lights. </p> <p>\"I took a two-year diploma in stage management at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in Glasgow, but I moved back to Manchester for family reasons after graduating. </p> <p>\"I had done a work placement at the Royal Exchange theatre in Manchester as part of my course, and they gave me my first proper job after putting me on their casual list. A show would finish on a Saturday night, and various crews would be brought in to work round the clock to make sure the next show could start on the Tuesday. I specialised in lighting and would strip out the old show, before setting up, focusing and programming the lights for the next. </p> <p>\"Regular work was hard to get at first and I did pub and factory work to make ends meet. I applied for the odd job out of the paper, but these jobs understandably tended to go to people who had more experience. Contacts are really important and in this industry it's who you know that tends to count when getting a job. </p> <p>\"I got my first full-time job in 1995 when my best friend from drama school was appointed technical manager at the Tron theatre in Glasgow and he asked me whether I would like to apply to become his deputy. The pay was not fantastic - about \u00a313,000 with overtime - but it was great fun. I left about two and a half years later when the theatre was heading for a 12-month period of refurbishment, as I wanted to be working on a show rather than in a darkened theatre. I went back to working freelance as there are comparatively few full-time jobs in Scotland, as there aren't that many theatres. </p> <p>\"It's an exciting life, as you never quite know how a show is going to pan out, but not a very financially rewarding one - especially if you're working for theatre companies funded by the Scottish Arts Council. Pay scales are improving, but even so I reckon I still only make about \u00a315,000.\" </p> <p><strong>Training courses</strong><br></p> <p><strong> Administration</strong> City University in London offers a one-year diploma course in arts management. </p> <p><strong> Design</strong> There are many courses available ranging from three years to one year. For a full list contact Society of British Theatre Designers, 47 Bermondsey St, London SE1 3XT. </p> <p><strong> Costume</strong> Some costume making is incorporated into most stage design and some drama school courses.

Cathy Joyce is now 40 and has a permanent job as senior lighting technician for the Royal National Theatre (RNT). \"When I first came into the profession it was rare to find a woman working backstage on the technical side,\" she says. \"You had to go out of your way to be seen lifting the heaviest equipment to prove you could do the job. These days women are much more integrated into the industry.\" For most of her career Ms Joyce chose to work freelance as the money was far better. Not that she was talking untold riches, mind. The theatre is not the destination for those who want to get rich quick. An ASM on a big show might earn \u00a3350 per week, while a stage manager with 15 years' experience on the same show may only be on about \u00a3500. Box office staff may be on \u00a315,000 while craft grades, such as costume designers, can expect to earn \u00a320,000. The good news is that the industry has well-organised unions, Bectu and Equity, which are hot on issues of pay and health and safety. Bectu, which has just ended a dispute with the Royal Opera House (ROH) over the suspension of one of its members, has individual agreements with the national houses, a collective agreement with the West End Theatre, and a minimum levels of pay and conditions of employment in the English repertory sector. The less good news, though, is that many theatres are happy to stick to the minimum levels. And, says Willie Donaghy, Bectu's arts and entertainment supervising officer, he faces a constant battle with theatre owners that want to erode his members' rights. \"The Society of London Theatres has recently introduced proposals for greater casualisation, compulsory Sunday working, having the workforce on call 24 hours a day and for the abolition of permanent staffing levels,\" he says. Further pay cuts may be in the offing as the EU's 48-hour working week comes into force. \"My basic contract is for a 40-hour week,\" says Cathy Joyce, \"but I usually end up working at least 60 hours. The overtime pay is an important part of my salary, and as the directive is implemented I will be restricted in the hours I can work. The RNT management and the union are working hard to resolve this, but since the theatre will have to take on more staff to make up the deficit, it's hard to see how pay levels can stay the same.\" Why it didn't end in tears for Dave Dave Shea, 30, is a freelance technical manager working for several Scottish theatre companies. He is currently working on the restaging of Tron Theatre and the Royal National Theatre's collaborative production of Zinnie Harris' Further than the Furthest Thing at the Tricycle Theatre in London. \"When I started my A-level Theatre Studies course I was mainly interested in performing, but we had a particularly forceful teacher who was always trying to push us to the point of tears, and I wasn't prepared to go as far as he wanted. Added to this, most of the other students were women and it was usually left to me to put up the sets when we took a show into school, and I gradually came to realise I was happiest working on the other side of the lights. \"I took a two-year diploma in stage management at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in Glasgow, but I moved back to Manchester for family reasons after graduating. \"I had done a work placement at the Royal Exchange theatre in Manchester as part of my course, and they gave me my first proper job after putting me on their casual list. A show would finish on a Saturday night, and various crews would be brought in to work round the clock to make sure the next show could start on the Tuesday. I specialised in lighting and would strip out the old show, before setting up, focusing and programming the lights for the next. \"Regular work was hard to get at first and I did pub and factory work to make ends meet. I applied for the odd job out of the paper, but these jobs understandably tended to go to people who had more experience. Contacts are really important and in this industry it's who you know that tends to count when getting a job. \"I got my first full-time job in 1995 when my best friend from drama school was appointed technical manager at the Tron theatre in Glasgow and he asked me whether I would like to apply to become his deputy. The pay was not fantastic - about \u00a313,000 with overtime - but it was great fun. I left about two and a half years later when the theatre was heading for a 12-month period of refurbishment, as I wanted to be working on a show rather than in a darkened theatre. I went back to working freelance as there are comparatively few full-time jobs in Scotland, as there aren't that many theatres. \"It's an exciting life, as you never quite know how a show is going to pan out, but not a very financially rewarding one - especially if you're working for theatre companies funded by the Scottish Arts Council. Pay scales are improving, but even so I reckon I still only make about \u00a315,000.\" Training courses Administration City University in London offers a one-year diploma course in arts management.

      "body": "<p>The financial sales lexicon has lots of magic words - growth, past performance, security and windfall are just some. They are all guaranteed to press the emotional buttons of prospective investors and shift product. </p> <p>But three short words have the most powerful magic of all. They are \"ten per cent\". And with inflation seemingly moribund - if not actually dead - that return is harder than ever to conjure up. </p> <p>This week, Money reveals how promises of about 10% income a year on financial products are unlikely to be achieved. It's as if the clock has been turned back to the Victorian era, when inflation was much more in line with today's sub-2% levels, and the most that was expected from investments was an income of 5% a year. </p> <p>Two weeks ago, the Financial Services Authority warned that investors - and their financial advisers - could suffer if they stick to 10% expectations rather than accept reality. \"Some do not understand the implications of low inflation for future returns,\" it says. \"Advertising products that emphasise past returns achieved in periods of higher inflation may confuse people about prospective future returns.\" </p> <p>But our investigation was prompted by private warnings from senior figures in the City that a raft of products launched in recent years offering double-digit returns may now be at severe risk, their sophisticated structures laid bare by the big fall in the stock market and technology shares in particular. </p> <p>The products are not specialist schemes used just by high net-worth individuals; small investors have bought into the schemes, based on investment trusts, which were plastered on billboards over the past couple of years promising 8%-10% income a year. It is believed that more than \u00a35bn of small investors' money is at stake, and some estimates say they involve more than 100,000 investors. </p> <p>What investors were buying was a high-income promise from some of the biggest names in the investment industry. What many may not have understood was that they were entering into some of the most complex products - split capital investment trusts - on offer in the retail financial market. </p> <p>But now an Edinburgh academic and a Scottish investment trust guru have teamed up to warn that these trusts both tread a dangerous road and have the potential to pull down the rest of the investment trust world, if not the market itself. </p> <p>They believe that the trusts are an upside-down pyramid, with the same limited cash pool whirling around the funds thanks to managers buying stakes in each others' products. </p> <p>Their fundamental criticism is of the fashion by fund managers in recent years of issuing complicated income-creating shares in investment areas which normally produce little in the way of dividends. The trusts tend to be invested in technology, Japanese equities or European companies. </p> <p>These are known as \"barbell trusts\". Andy Adams and Robin Angus of the Centre for Financial Markets Research at Edinburgh University say these trusts are really two portfolios - about half goes into \"capital\" shares which yield little or nothing while the balance, the \"income\" shares, are invested in high-yield instruments. These may be \"junk\" bonds issued by secondary telecom companies or high-interest debt issued by governments in developing countries. </p> <p>To ratchet the income even higher, the trusts may also \"gear up\" - borrowing money at, say, 6% to buy bonds yielding, perhaps, 12%. </p> <p>But the sharp fall in bonds offered by debt-laden telecom companies, and the recent Argentinian government debt crisis, have exposed the fragility of some of the split-capital investment trusts. </p> <p>Holding the two ends of the \"split caps\" together is the weakest link - the big bank borrowings which can be called in if either of the two weights fails. </p> <p>\"There has been a boom in these issues,\" says Mr Angus. \"Up to \u00a35.4bn of these shares were issued in 1999 and 2000 alone. They are designed to overcome low returns, to meet investor clamour for the high yields they have been used to for decades.\" </p> <p>Two have already hit problems. The highly geared Framlington NetNet Income, which invests in internet stocks while promising a high income, had shrunk in value from \u00a348m to \u00a38m when its bankers pulled the plug following Nasdaq's plunge. </p> <p>And Aberdeen's Technology and Income had to be restructured for similar reasons. Both these trusts were launched at the height of the tech stock bubble. </p> <p>\"In the past, investment trusts were structured for the long term so investors could ride out market setbacks,\" says fund manager Alastair Mundy at Investec. </p> <p>\"Now many of the returns depend on debt which can be recalled at short notice if either end of the barbell breaches bank covenants. When one end is highrisk, high-tech and the other is high-risk junk bonds, it is easy for something to go wrong. And even easier when many of the high income investments are shares in other investment trusts' income shares.\" </p> <p>These crossholdings raise the spectre of a domino style collapse with contagion spreading - in the same way as foot and mouth - to previously healthy investments. </p> <p>\"It is difficult to work out who owns what. Worse is what the inter-related structure of cross holdings could lead to in a falling market,\" say Mr Adams and Mr Angus. </p> <p>\"Price declines might become a self-feeding downward spiral as the net asset values of other trust shares hold also decline. Once these unravel, confidence in all investment trusts could suffer,\" they add. </p> <p>\"It's all too easy for contagion to spread,\" says Legal &amp; General fund manager David North. \"Problems in Thailand four years ago spread as far as Brazil even though there were no links between the two. Once you get uncertainty, you get a ripple effect into other investments.\" </p> <p>But there are many in the investment trust industry who do not share the gloom. Fund managers say that these high return shares are largely bought by professionals and they know what they are doing. </p> <p>\"A number of trusts are at or near levels where banks could pull the rug,\" says Nigel Sidebottom of investment trust specialists BFS Investments. \"But trusts are getting better at renegotiating terms. </p> <p>\"Highly geared shares do suffer more than most in falling markets but they have more capacity for recovery.

The composer went so far as to beg his friends not to attend the premiere of a work which, in a dark moment, he described as \"boring, feeble and stupid\". </p> <p>Those are not words that leap to mind after seeing Opera North's new production. Renamed Paradise Moscow, this is a reorchestrated, expanded version of the 1994 Pimlico Opera production arranged for small band by Gerard McBurney. It uses director David Pountney's sharp, incisive translation - a vast improvement on the rather stilted original. Add McBurney's keen instinct for theatre scoring, Craig Revel Horwood's inspired choreography and an outstanding cast, and you have one of Opera North's finest creations in years. </p> <p>Paradise Moscow is not an operetta in the strict sense: it has a fast-moving dialogue and song-and-dance routines more reminiscent of vaudeville. Pountney has exploited this magnificently, especially with regard to his villains. Barabashkin (Campbell Morrison) oscillates between sounding like a deranged sergeant-major and a likable Bob Hoskins, while Vava (Margaret Preece), the boss's conniving girlfriend, has a wonderful cockney screech unnervingly reminiscent of Terry Jones in Life of Brian. </p> <p>Moscow, Cheryomushki was the gentlest of satires on Soviet life, but Paradise Moscow is a fully blown send-up, with the cavorting figures of Lenin, Stalin and Marx making a memorable appearance. KGB men pop up repeatedly and irrelevantly, more ridiculous than sinister. The extent to which Pountney has revised the libretto is especially blatant when Masha and Sasha compare reactions to the sound of a doorbell: Masha's memories - innocent in the original - are of feet on the stairs, limousines in the streets and a suitcase kept packed by the door. It felt slightly overdone. But there can be little doubt that Shostakovich would have loved this production - he might even have added Paradise Moscow to his A-list. </p> <p>\u0095 Until May 12.

      "bodyText": "Shostakovich consigned his only operetta, Moscow, Cheryomushki, to his personal B-list. The composer went so far as to beg his friends not to attend the premiere of a work which, in a dark moment, he described as \"boring, feeble and stupid\". Those are not words that leap to mind after seeing Opera North's new production. Renamed Paradise Moscow, this is a reorchestrated, expanded version of the 1994 Pimlico Opera production arranged for small band by Gerard McBurney. It uses director David Pountney's sharp, incisive translation - a vast improvement on the rather stilted original. Add McBurney's keen instinct for theatre scoring, Craig Revel Horwood's inspired choreography and an outstanding cast, and you have one of Opera North's finest creations in years. Paradise Moscow is not an operetta in the strict sense: it has a fast-moving dialogue and song-and-dance routines more reminiscent of vaudeville. Pountney has exploited this magnificently, especially with regard to his villains. Barabashkin (Campbell Morrison) oscillates between sounding like a deranged sergeant-major and a likable Bob Hoskins, while Vava (Margaret Preece), the boss's conniving girlfriend, has a wonderful cockney screech unnervingly reminiscent of Terry Jones in Life of Brian. Moscow, Cheryomushki was the gentlest of satires on Soviet life, but Paradise Moscow is a fully blown send-up, with the cavorting figures of Lenin, Stalin and Marx making a memorable appearance. KGB men pop up repeatedly and irrelevantly, more ridiculous than sinister. The extent to which Pountney has revised the libretto is especially blatant when Masha and Sasha compare reactions to the sound of a doorbell: Masha's memories - innocent in the original - are of feet on the stairs, limousines in the streets and a suitcase kept packed by the door. It felt slightly overdone. But there can be little doubt that Shostakovich would have loved this production - he might even have added Paradise Moscow to his A-list. \u0095 Until May 12. Box office: 0113-222 6222. Then at Sadler's Wells, London EC1 (020-7863 8000), from May 23.",

Last night the brightest sparks of England's football academies faced their stiffest assessment so far. </p> <p>They did not quite make the grade, going down 4-0 to a talented French side for whom Florent Sinama Pongolle and Anthony le Tallec gave a display of all-round attacking quality the like of which the locals among the 30,000 crowd have not seen for some time. </p> <p>The duo, who both play for Le Havre, had scored seven between them in the four previous matches and they did not wait long to add to the tally. Whatever inspiring words Bobby Robson had uttered when he visited the English players before kick-off were still echoing around the dressing room when the lanky Le Tallec turned an innocuous-looking cross into the first goal with an acrobatic overhead kick worthy of the great Klaus Fischer. </p> <p>Two minutes later his partner threw off his marker with a twinkletoed turn, advanced to the edge of the area and fired a low shot into the corner of Lenny Pidgeley's goal. </p> <p>Two down inside four minutes, England did well not to capitulate.

      "bodyText": "The former head of FA youth coaching John Cartwright once commented that every competitive game was an examination. Last night the brightest sparks of England's football academies faced their stiffest assessment so far. They did not quite make the grade, going down 4-0 to a talented French side for whom Florent Sinama Pongolle and Anthony le Tallec gave a display of all-round attacking quality the like of which the locals among the 30,000 crowd have not seen for some time. The duo, who both play for Le Havre, had scored seven between them in the four previous matches and they did not wait long to add to the tally. Whatever inspiring words Bobby Robson had uttered when he visited the English players before kick-off were still echoing around the dressing room when the lanky Le Tallec turned an innocuous-looking cross into the first goal with an acrobatic overhead kick worthy of the great Klaus Fischer. Two minutes later his partner threw off his marker with a twinkletoed turn, advanced to the edge of the area and fired a low shot into the corner of Lenny Pidgeley's goal. Two down inside four minutes, England did well not to capitulate. Yet despite the endeavour of Craig Westcarr on the right of midfield and the hard work of Cherno Samba upfront, they created little more than half-chances, the best of which, Westcarr's header from Kris Taylor's looping cross, flew narrowly wide. A decade ago Cartwright's view was that the English system placed too much emphasis on passing exams and not enough on education. Since then youth coaching in this country, like the education system, has undergone a radical overhaul. The latest national curriculum is the brainchild of football's answer to Chris Woodhead, the FA's technical director Howard Wilkinson. The new model has put the stress firmly on instruction. Unfortunately for the English, when it comes to cramming players full of knowledge France are currently the planet's most successful nation. They are the World, European and European Under-18 champions. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Jodar's Under-16 team may yet prove to be his nation's best-educated set of players. Up until this encounter they had scored 13 goals and conceded none. For most of last night's game they gave the hosts a masterclass in technique and movement. The French youngsters play to the same pattern as their senior 11.

The young No10 controlled the ball with his first touch, then rolled a pass with his studs into the path of the onrushing Pongolle. The striker dashed past Steven Schumacher and cut the ball back for Le Tallec, whose firmly struck shot rattled the bar. The second half offered more of the same with Le Tallec and Pongolle both scoring again, the latter after running from the halfway line. This was the first time England had reached the last four in this competition since a fresh-faced Tony Adams was marshalling the defence (on that occasion they were beaten by the USSR) and the coach Dick Bate had already acknowledged that his charges had exceeded expectation by beating Germany in a penalty shoot-out in the quarter-finals.

QPR quickly issued a statement criticising the leak and insisted that before any final decision they had always intended to consult their supporters, via a questionnaire, in a \"sensible and controlled manner\", and will do so still if merger discussions continue. Privately QPR went further. \"It had always been decided this wouldn't go through without the blessing of the majority of the fans,\" insisted one source. \"It just wouldn't have worked.\" Koppel took a similar line. \"It has to come down to whether or not the supporters feel that it is something they can buy into.\" \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "bodyText": "Meddlesome priests have come a long way since the twelfth century, when Thomas \u00e0 Becket, the then Archbishop of Canterbury, pushed King Henry II too far and paid for his impertinence with his life - but they can still be a divisive force. In Belgium, where the Catholic church is struggling to modernise itself, a young rebel priest is in open conflict with the primate of all Belgium, Cardinal Godfried Danneels, and the dispute is threatening to drag the church into chaos. Rudy Borremans, 32, a spiky-haired, bespectacled Flemish priest - more Gary Rhodes than Thomas Becket - has enraged senior clerics by openly living with his gay lover and setting up an unorthodox \"rent-a-priest\" business. The Dutch-speaking renegade is also challenging the church to lighten up and come to terms with what have traditionally been taboo issues; sex, euthanasia and abortion. In an unprecedented move he will be forced to face down his accusers in an ecclesiastical court later this year. If Borremans is found guilty of violating church laws, he could be ex-communicated and cast into a secular wilderness forever. Needless to say he is not popular with the establishment. But it is not his homosexuality that the church reproaches him for, but rather his breaking of the vow of celibacy he took when he joined the priesthood. Heterosexual priests are also forbidden from taking a sexual partner or a wife. Observers estimate, however, that at least 50% of the country's priests have illicit sexual relations with men or women but are simply far more successful than Borremans at keeping it a secret. But, to cap it all, Borremans is outspoken, and his rent-a-priest service, which hires out disgraced former clerics to administer at weddings, baptisms and funerals at rates which undercut the official Catholic church, has turned him into a b\u00eate noire. He only asks that people pay \"what they can afford\" for such services, and is happy to cater for punters who are normally turned away by the established church; namely single mothers, divorcees and homosexuals. \"The problem is that the priests wear two hats at the same time,\" Danneels has complained. \"One day, they officiate according to Catholic practice and the next day they administer at secular ceremonies.\" The dispute has been bitter and now it shows every sign of escalating. Despite the fact that he was suspended from his duties as a cleric two years ago, Borremans has carried out at least 90 unofficial baptisms since then. Nine face-to-face meetings with the Cardinal, aimed at settling the dispute, have failed and, incredibly, both sides claim to have received threatening phone calls and been intimidated by unidentified thugs. Borremans has even threatened to take Danneels to court for defamation of character and, over Easter, he deliberately defied the increasingly tetchy Cardinal. Banned from attending a special mass at Mechelen cathedral, near Brussels, at which priests repledge their allegiance to Danneels, the rebel cleric turned up with a small band of supporters. Church sources called the stunt 'the ultimate provocation'. Last year, Borremans went on hunger strike to draw attention to what he called 'the church's abuses'. He now lives, quite openly, with his gay lover Guy Vermeylen in an unremarkable apartment block in Leuven, the town famous for Stella Artois lager. He remains convinced, however, that the church must reform if it is to survive. \"I still feel like a Catholic priest despite being suspended,\" he explains. \"But I feel that there are certain issues which the church must take on board, such as the role of women, sexuality, euthanasia and abortion\u0085 but they don't even allow debate! \"Anything which is illegal causes wounds which fill with puss which nobody heals. Not even the church.\" Borremans claims to receive hundreds of letters from supporters who feel marginalised by the church, and feels that he has a mission to carry on his priestly duties because of his background. \"People have a huge need for rituals where symbols really mean something, be it from a text or from somebody who embodies religion.\" Convinced of the justness of his cause, Borremans's self-confidence means he is unlikely to throw in the towel any time soon. \"In some ways I feel like an oracle.

      "body": "<p>Thursday April 26 was another big day for me - my last day ever at my hotel in Sydney. For the last time I dragged myself in too early, polished, cleaned, set, served, vacuumed... well, OK, I'm not really going to miss that but I'll certainly miss the social side and all the different people I've met. On the other hand I couldn't wait to be hitting the road again - there's a very big world just waiting for me to see it. </p> <p>Friday night was my official work farewell night, so before that I attempted to get my life into order. I phoned the Oz Experience people whom I'm travelling with between Sydney and Cairns, and booked to leave on Tuesday. I'd already bought the ticket in England, now its just a little matter of phoning them every time I want to travel on - though sadly I've got to be in Cairns by May 20, so its going to be something of a whistle-stop tour. However, I've had lots of good advice so I'm going to try and fit in as much as possible. That night was a particularly mad one, but as it was the last time I would ever see the people from work it was nice to go with a bang! </p> <p>On Saturday I somehow managed to rouse myself in time to go to the races. The night before my manager had been kind enough to give me some tickets he couldn't use (including entry into the members' stand) on the condition that I go along and dress up. There was no way I could turn down an offer like that. The race course was just a short bus-ride from my house which gave me time to hunt out my sole respectable outfit! </p> <p>I've never been to the races before, but it was quite an experience. The men were all in suits and the women in various states of classy dress with the odd wonderful hat - although nothing on the Ascot scale. People-watching was probably the highlight of the day. I allocated myself a sum of money to waste - I had no illusions of ever seeing it again - and then realised I had no idea how to place a bet. After several failed attempts I enlisted the help of a nice lady, and finally succeeded in placing a small bet 'each way'. I watched from the stalls as the horses thundered towards the finish-line. Mine came in fourth. I asked an old couple if that meant I'd won anything, but sadly not. </p> <p>There were eight races that day and I improved at the betting business enough that I was soon confidently requesting \"five to win on number three in the fourth\". It was definitely fun to watch the tiny jockeys race by, but it wasn't until the third race when my horse snatched it by a nose that I understood the rush of winning and why everybody jumps up from their seats and yells at the track. A dangerously addictive pass-time and an interesting afternoon - and I returned home with exactly the amount of money I'd left with, so I couldn't complain. I had my last big night out in Sydney with my flat-mates that evening, and in some ways I'm looking forward to pursuing a more relaxed lifestyle as I head up the coast (hopefully). </p> <p>I had very little time left in Sydney and didn't want to waste any of it, so on Sunday I dragged my flat-mate to Sydney Aquarium, a tourist spot I had yet to visit. Besides, a perk of my job was that I got free entry, so it would have been silly to pass it up. I'd hardly describe myself as a fan of caged-creature exhibitions, but the Aquarium really surprised me - there was loads of fascinating marine life I'll just never have the opportunity to see in its natural habitat. We saw lazy seals and a sleeping (but still extremely menacing) crocodile, walked through glass tunnels where huge sharks and rays swam overhead (the former with far too many teeth for my liking), saw giant crabs and many, many types of fish. The names were as varied as the appearance, my personal favourite being the 'half and half goat-fish'. </p> <p>On Monday morning my friend from home and east coast travelling-partner Gary arrived from Melbourne. Monday night was our last in Sydney and I intended to do so much, but then I met a work-mate for a last ridiculously large lunch where once again I had to endure eating oysters - I think I'm getting braver. Somehow lunch stretched into the evening, so I was a little disorganised. </p> <p>Basically, Gary and I were booked through to Byron Bay on the Oz bus, but there are certain compulsory stops the bus makes so we had to make a day-by-day itinerary. I wasn't ecstatic about this as I'd prefer to take each day as it comes, but with just a 20-day trip, I do want to make the most of my time. So on Tuesday morning, early, we arrived at Sydney Central Station and I was finally on my way! A girl from work, Amanda, was on the same bus as us by coincidence - I was definitely no longer a lone traveller. We were bound for a sheep station in Nundle - eight hours north of Sydney on our big green bus - nothing could be further removed from my months in the city! Our bus and another going the opposite way on the south-bound route both arrived there on the same night, so there were nearly 100 of us crammed into 14-bed dormitories in converted sheep-barns, having a party out in the Australian countryside. It was a good night for getting to know our fellow travellers - most of whom we'll be with for the next three days through to Byron - and they certainly kept us entertained. At one point a padding-covered barrel on ropes descended from the ceiling. This was 'Curly', the wild sheep, and the idea is to ride it for as long as possible while the farm-hands swing the ropes to make it buck. I though I did alright - well, OK, I stayed on for a few seconds. After that the barn was converted into a disco and we boogied the night away well into the small hours. </p> <p>The next morning everyone was woken by the soothing sounds of dogs being loosed into the dorm rooms. At least I was on a top bunk. A few groans later we pulled ourselves up and out, ready to head on to our next destination: the previously unheard-of town of Bingara, further north. The Oz bus is excellent at sorting your accommodation, helping with an itinerary and any trips you're interested in, but I did wish some of these stops weren't compulsory as our time was short enough. </p> <p>As it turned out, Bingara was a fantastic stop. Our bus took over the local pub, then a group of about 40 of us headed down the road for a late afternoon's horse-riding. I was a bit nervous after my horse-trek in Queenstown, but figured the best thing was just to get back in the saddle. The riding ranch couldn't have been more brilliant, though, and I needn't have been nervous. Everyone was given horses to suit their ability and confidence and we were vaguely split into ability groups, so the better riders could really push themselves while we wandered behind. The leaders were absolutely fantastic - they took the time to come and see everybody individually and I felt like I'd learned loads over the afternoon - by the end, I'd got my confidence back so much that I was taken cantering. Gary had never ridden before in his life and I suddenly saw him come cantering past, so I can safely say this place will look after everybody. The scenery was fantastic - riding through bush and rivers as the sun set. We even saw wild kangaroos watching from the woods. </p> <p>The absolute highlight came when we made a quick stop by a river and I got to go 'horse-surfing'. Both Amanda and I had neglected to bring our swimming-costumes but, after watching a handful of others, we borrowed shorts and went in fully clothed. Basically, the horse goes into the water up to its withers, then you grab its tail and cling on for dear life! One of the leaders then gets the horse to canter and you're dragged behind, flying on top of the water. It was such a funny experience - one of those bizarre activities you never imagine doing but will remember forever. </p> <p>That night in the pub was pretty quiet and Bingara definitely isn't a party town, but I'd had such a good time riding that I almost regretted that we were heading on the next morning. Sadly, however, this is a very quick tour of the coast, and now I can't wait for tomorrow when I have my one night in Byron Bay - then move on...</p> <p>Until next week (racing my way up the coast and loving it) </p> <p>Milly</p>",

That night in the pub was pretty quiet and Bingara definitely isn't a party town, but I'd had such a good time riding that I almost regretted that we were heading on the next morning. Sadly, however, this is a very quick tour of the coast, and now I can't wait for tomorrow when I have my one night in Byron Bay - then move on... Until next week (racing my way up the coast and loving it) Milly",

      "bodyText": "The richest forests on Earth - on the Sundra Shelf in Sumatra, Indonesia - will be totally destroyed in five years if the current \"resource anarchy\" in the country continues, say four world experts in today's edition of the magazine Science. Key animal species such as the Sumatran rhinoceros, the Sumatran tiger and the Asian elephant are heading for extinction unless there is radical action to save them, they say. The report says that the local districts charged with managing the forests cannot cope with illegal logging gangs. During a visit to Indonesia in December, the authors saw the gangs acting freely, clearing and burning large tracts of forests for agriculture. They also saw extensive saw mill operations. The report claims that Jakarta is unable, or unwilling, to stop such activity but that to avoid a \"biological catastrophe\" action cannot be delayed until the political climate settles. Forests on the Kerinci lowlands will be destroyed in three years, the report says, while illegal logging vastly increases the risks of huge forest fires and could trigger widespread flooding due to the diminishing number of trees able to soak up rainwater. The authors include Kathy MacKinnon, senior biodiversity expert at the World Bank, and Paul Jepson, an Indonesia conservation expert. The authors suggest prosecuting illegal loggers, including top officials, and greater public exposure of wrongdoing. They also called for vigorous opposition at local level.",

While at Toronto, he designed and built the first portable cryostat, a glass apparatus for maintaining very low temperatures, which was taken to London for McLennan to give a public lecture on liquid helium and demonstrate superconductivity at the Royal Institution. The apparatus is still in the institution's museum.</p> <p>In 1935, Allen moved to the Royal Society Mond Laboratory, Cambridge, where he had hoped to work with the Russian physicist Peter Kapitza, who was renowned for his work with extremely low temperatures of liquid helium. But, in 1934, after one of his annual visits to his mother in the Soviet Union, Kapitza was detained, and never returned to Cambridge.</p> <p>So the two scientists worked independently, and, in January 1938, the science journal Nature published the results of their separate work.</p> <p>Two single-page papers appeared side by side; one by Kapitza in Moscow, the other by Allen and Misener, both then at Cambridge. Both papers reported experiments showing that helium could flow through incredibly small channels with apparently zero viscosity - this was the discovery of superfluidity.</p> <p>For reasons yet to be unravelled by science historians, most of the credit for the discovery was given to Kapitza, who won the 1978 Nobel physics prize for his work.</p> <p>Allen continued research and teaching at Cambridge until 1947, when he was made professor of natural philosophy at St Andrews University. He was twice dean of the faculty of science, and responsible for major reforms. He had an important influence both in establishing the university's international reputation in pure and applied physics and astronomy, and in encouraging the development of science in Scotland.</p> <p>Allen was elected a fellow of the Physical Society in 1945, of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and the American Physical Society in 1948, and of the Royal Society in 1949. He was chairman of the very-low temperature commission of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics, and a member of the British National Committee for Physics.</p> <p>His 1933 marriage to Elfriede Hiebert ended in divorce in 1951; they adopted a son, Hugh, who survives him.</p> <p>\u0095 John Frank Allen, physicist, born May 6 1908; died April 22 2001</p>",

The apparatus is still in the institution's museum. In 1935, Allen moved to the Royal Society Mond Laboratory, Cambridge, where he had hoped to work with the Russian physicist Peter Kapitza, who was renowned for his work with extremely low temperatures of liquid helium. But, in 1934, after one of his annual visits to his mother in the Soviet Union, Kapitza was detained, and never returned to Cambridge. So the two scientists worked independently, and, in January 1938, the science journal Nature published the results of their separate work. Two single-page papers appeared side by side; one by Kapitza in Moscow, the other by Allen and Misener, both then at Cambridge. Both papers reported experiments showing that helium could flow through incredibly small channels with apparently zero viscosity - this was the discovery of superfluidity. For reasons yet to be unravelled by science historians, most of the credit for the discovery was given to Kapitza, who won the 1978 Nobel physics prize for his work. Allen continued research and teaching at Cambridge until 1947, when he was made professor of natural philosophy at St Andrews University. He was twice dean of the faculty of science, and responsible for major reforms. He had an important influence both in establishing the university's international reputation in pure and applied physics and astronomy, and in encouraging the development of science in Scotland. Allen was elected a fellow of the Physical Society in 1945, of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and the American Physical Society in 1948, and of the Royal Society in 1949. He was chairman of the very-low temperature commission of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics, and a member of the British National Committee for Physics. His 1933 marriage to Elfriede Hiebert ended in divorce in 1951; they adopted a son, Hugh, who survives him. \u0095 John Frank Allen, physicist, born May 6 1908; died April 22 2001",

      "bodyText": "Police are investigating the affairs of a Labour councillor who allegedly channelled thousands of pounds of regeneration funding into his own private company. Duncan McGregor is being investigated by fraud squad officers in Derbyshire over allegations that he used his position as head of a regeneration trust in a rundown mining area to line his own pocket. He has already paid money back to a village parish council that uncovered his secret scheme to siphon money from the trust to his own firm - and which has now asked the police to investigate him. Until recently, Mr McGregor was head of the scrutiny panel at his local authority, Bolsover district council, but stood down from the chair when the parish council's allegations were made public. The claims centre on Creswell regeneration trust, which Mr McGregor helped set up in 1996 to help breathe new life back into the former pit village. Mr McGregor and Keith De Banke had been chairman and clerk, respectively, of Creswell parish council when it was decided the council should grant \u00a310,000 a year to the trust to develop new sports facilities at the village miners' welfare building. Both Mr McGregor and Mr De Banke were directors of the trust, a company limited by guarantee. Between 1996 and 1998, the council gave \u00a330,000 to the regeneration trust but became concerned when there was no sign of any new sports facilities at the miners' welfare, which had been refurbished by the trust with funding from numerous public bodies. When Labour lost control of the parish council in 1999, the ruling independent group instigated an investigation and found that a private company of which Mr McGregor and Mr De Banke were both directors had bought the offices in which the regeneration trust was based and the trust was now paying rent to the firm. A total of \u00a313,000 of public money had been paid to their private company before the arrangement was revealed. It is not known what difference, if any, there was in the amount of rent paid to Mr McGregor's company and that paid to the previous landlord. In an out-of-court settlement, the two men agreed to pay \u00a35,000 each and legal costs of \u00a316,000 to Creswell parish council, which sued them for \"recovery of personal gain\" and whose case was due to be heard last month. Further investigations revealed that on numerous occasions between 1997 and last year, Mr McGregor's separate expenses for representing Bolsover district council and the regeneration trust showed him to be in different parts of the country at the same time. On the same day, Mr McGregor managed to be in Torquay on council business and in Worksop, North Nottinghamshire, on trust business. Other examples show him to have been in Wigan and Hull; London and Matlock; and Glasgow and Lichfield. Bolsover district council has said its dealings with the trust were all satisfactorily audited and Mr McGregor's expenses claims were legitimate. Chairman of Cresswell parish council, Shaun Wass, said there should be strict rules governing councillors handling public funds but not making themselves publicly accountable. He said: \"It is an absolute disgrace that he has received personal benefit from public funding. The rules need to be tightened up to stop anything like this happening again.\" He said the parish council had voted overwhelmingly in favour of Mr McGregor resigning his seat, but he had refused to go, claiming he had done nothing wrong. Mr De Banke resigned as clerk and finance officer in 1999. Derbyshire police confirmed they were investigating allegations made against Mr McGregor, who was unavailable for comment.",

And yet despite the impasse, a poll published today suggests Israelis remain extraordinarily satisfied with their prime minister. The survey, which appears in Yediot Ahronoth, the country's largest circulation newspaper, found 70% of Israelis - and 78% of Jewish Israelis - say they trust Mr Sharon as prime minister. That gives him the highest credibility rating of any Israeli prime minister, according to the poll for the Dahaf Institute.

He has turned the invasion of Palestinian-ruled territory into the Gaza Strip - a violation of the Oslo peace accords - into a regular exercise.

      "body": "<p>A woman today failed today in a bid to save her five pet sheep from being slaughtered as part of pre-emptive cull measures in light of foot-and-mouth disease.</p> <p>Carolyn Hoffe had barricaded the five rare Dutch Zwartbles sheep in the living room of her home in Glasserton, near Whithorn, Dumfries and Galloway, to prevent Government officials from culling the animals.</p> <p>She launched a legal challenge at the Court of Session in Edinburgh but following the three-hour hearing Lord Clarke said that he was not prepared to suspend the slaughter, which can now be carried out immediately.</p> <p>Lord Clarke described the case of Mrs Hoffe's sheep as \"a fast-moving situation\".</p> <p>He said he was not wholly convinced there was no merit in Mrs Hoffe's petition, but added \"I'm not prepared to grant interim suspension of the Scottish ministers' decisions since on the basis of what has been submitted to me and the material placed before me, I am quite satisfied that the balance of convenience lies with the respondents.\"</p> <p>Mr Moynihan then told the court that the Executive would be advised that the cull could take place straight away.</p> <p>He said: \"Advice will be given to the ministers that they are entirely free to proceed immediately.\"</p> <p>The QC also denied that the Scottish Executive had been \"rigid\" in implementing its pre-emptive cull policy at Mrs Hoffe's property.</p> <p>He said that unlike in the case of Mr Stokes's farm, Mrs Hoffe's sheep had been outdoors when foot-and-mouth was first confirmed in the area.</p> <p>Mr Moynihan also said that despite Mrs Hoffe keeping the sheep in her house to prevent them becoming infected, her decision to allow a film crew into her home had proved she was not reliable.</p> <p>He also pointed out that there had been repeated correspondence between Mrs Hoffe and the Executive, whose officials had re-investigated the case three times before deciding to proceed with the cull.</p> <p>The QC said Mrs Hoffe's sheep must be slaughtered to prevent further spread of the disease.</p> <p>He added: \"Scottish ministers cannot take the risk of leaving five sheep at the very centre of that seat of infection because only one of those five sheep could itself cause western spread of this infection.</p> <p>\"If the ministers are correct in their suspicion and Mrs Hoffe's petition is granted, there is the risk of substantial damage to the national interest because of the dairy herds surrounding this area.\"</p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br><a

      "bodyText": "A woman today failed today in a bid to save her five pet sheep from being slaughtered as part of pre-emptive cull measures in light of foot-and-mouth disease. Carolyn Hoffe had barricaded the five rare Dutch Zwartbles sheep in the living room of her home in Glasserton, near Whithorn, Dumfries and Galloway, to prevent Government officials from culling the animals. She launched a legal challenge at the Court of Session in Edinburgh but following the three-hour hearing Lord Clarke said that he was not prepared to suspend the slaughter, which can now be carried out immediately. Lord Clarke described the case of Mrs Hoffe's sheep as \"a fast-moving situation\". He said he was not wholly convinced there was no merit in Mrs Hoffe's petition, but added \"I'm not prepared to grant interim suspension of the Scottish ministers' decisions since on the basis of what has been submitted to me and the material placed before me, I am quite satisfied that the balance of convenience lies with the respondents.\" Mr Moynihan then told the court that the Executive would be advised that the cull could take place straight away. He said: \"Advice will be given to the ministers that they are entirely free to proceed immediately.\" The QC also denied that the Scottish Executive had been \"rigid\" in implementing its pre-emptive cull policy at Mrs Hoffe's property. He said that unlike in the case of Mr Stokes's farm, Mrs Hoffe's sheep had been outdoors when foot-and-mouth was first confirmed in the area. Mr Moynihan also said that despite Mrs Hoffe keeping the sheep in her house to prevent them becoming infected, her decision to allow a film crew into her home had proved she was not reliable. He also pointed out that there had been repeated correspondence between Mrs Hoffe and the Executive, whose officials had re-investigated the case three times before deciding to proceed with the cull. The QC said Mrs Hoffe's sheep must be slaughtered to prevent further spread of the disease. He added: \"Scottish ministers cannot take the risk of leaving five sheep at the very centre of that seat of infection because only one of those five sheep could itself cause western spread of this infection. \"If the ministers are correct in their suspicion and Mrs Hoffe's petition is granted, there is the risk of substantial damage to the national interest because of the dairy herds surrounding this area.\" What's going on?

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>ACTION TIME</strong></p> <p>Forget talk of Queens Park Dons and Shepherd's Bush Wombles. It ain't gonna happen. The proposed merger between QPR and Wimbledon is sinking faster than the crafty, crooked, corrupt and corpulent frame (yes, the thesaurus is out) of the late, fat Robert Maxwell - and it can't be long before the plan joins the sweaty schemer's attempt to merge Oxford and Reading on football's seabed.</p> <p>\"The merger isn't going to happen,\" QPR 1st spokesman Libby Magrill told the Fiver today. \"We met with Chris Wright yesterday, and although he wasn't that keen on the idea anymore anyway, we helped to persuade him that it was an awful plan.\" Better still, Libby reckons the deal could be pronounced dead within 48 hours. \"The Wimbledon Supporters Association will meeting with Charles Koppel on Sunday, and I think it'll be dead by then.\"</p> <p>So make that 1-0 to direct action. But now another challenge awaits: getting ITV to show Leeds's Big Cup semi-final second-leg match against Valencia next Tuesday. Today the Fiver found out there's nothing in ITV's contract to stop them showing the game, providing obscure digital channel ONdigital allows them to do so. Seeing as ITV companies Granada and Carlton own ONdigital, that shouldn't be a problem. But guess what?</p> <p>\"This isn't the sort of thing that supporters like to hear, but the reason why companies spend a lot of money on rights is to encourage people to subscribe to our services,\" brayed blas\u00e9 ONdigital spokesperson Andrew Marr today. And as we cowered, Marr - not to be confused with the BBC's political editor, who wouldn't hurt a fly - followed up his attack with the thundering: \"We have paid a lot of money for these rights, so why should we give them away? If they want to see the game they can go to our website and find a pub showing the game.\" Indeed. Indeed. And you wonder why nobody watches your rubbish channel.</p> <p><strong>CANTONAESQUE</strong></p> <p>Six years ago, Eric Cantona jumped over the advertising hoardings at Selhurst Park and stuck his fist into the loud ignorant mouth of Matthew Simmonds. Echoes of that incident could be heard bouncing around the walls of Brentford's Griffin Park ground last night, as Luton defender Jude Stirling was arrested after allegedly attacking a Brentford fan who is said to have shouted racist abuse during a match.</p> <p>The incident occurred with Stirling sitting in the dug-out watching his team play out a 2-2 draw with their hosts. Luton boss Joe Kinnear takes up the story: \"The fan was throwing racial abuse at Liam George throughout the game. The guy came up with one hand in his pocket and walked up to Jude's face and said something highly offensive and disgraceful. Jude said he thought [the fan] might have had something in his pocket - maybe a knife or something like that - he didn't know what to do so he felt he was defending himself and gave him a right-hander.\"</p> <p>Sure enough, it wasn't long before the police put a stop to the affair and took Stirling down to Chiswick nick, where they discussed the matter at some length with him before turfing him out at 3.30am. \"A man has been bailed to return to police on June 5 pending further inquiries in connection with an alleged assault,\" said a Scotland Yard spokesman, who confirmed that a 33-year-old man had been injured but no charges had been brought. \"We are looking at video footage from the ground.\" While Stirling must wait to find out his fate, Kinnear has promised to \"do the best I can to support the kid\", claiming: \"One doesn't like to see any sort of violence at football matches but Jude reacted in the same manner that I would have done myself.\" That's nearly a Hegelian dialectic. Er, we think.</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"One or two situations are progressing quite well regarding new signings\" - Could this be a return to the situation situation for Tottenham manager Glenn Hoddle?</p> <p><strong>ELEMENTARY, IT'S WATSON</strong></p> <p>Never change a winning formula, that's what they say. Who they are we're not sure, and why we should trust them we don't know. But we do. As, indeed, do Tranmere Rovers, who having already enjoyed years of amazing success with an angry-looking shouty bloke who spent most of his life on Merseyside in charge, have gone and appointed another as their new manager. Step forward, former Everton defender and formidable frowning man Dave Watson, and become the latest man to make rash promises that will be regretted six months down the line.</p> <p>\"It's to be known straight away that the target is promotion,\" the 39-year-old began. \"There's no time for consolidation because the squad of players that we have are well capable of challenging for promotion,\" he continued. \"I've already seen quite a few Tranmere games this season. And a lot of what I have seen has been Tranmere have playing quite well but giving away silly goals or missing easy chances,\" he went on, almost making it sound as though he'd been doing nothing at all for the last year or so.</p> <p>And although Watson comes fresh from Goodison Park where he's been coaching the players, nothing is probably exactly what he's been doing. Well, have you seen Everton play recently? Nevertheless, he's not totally without management experience, having been put in charge at Goodison for six weeks in 1997 during one of the club's very many crises. \"I throughly enjoyed that and I'm looking forward to having the chance here,\" he reminisced. What price on him facing his old team in a league derby come season 2002/3, do you think?</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Midas Soccer reckons that Sol Campbell won't be moving to Barcelona - yet. They claim \"all the talk at the Lane is that Sol will sign a one-year deal and see what happens in Glenn Hoddle's first full season in charge.\" The website also reports that Hoddle is planning a \u00a32m move for Quinton Fortune. Meanwhile, Teddy Sheringham has rejected United's offer of a one-year contract and a move to Fulham - and is set to sign a lucrative two-year deal with Spurs.</p> <p>Liverpool are planning a \u00a36m bid for Gareth Southgate.</p> <p><strong>NEWS IN BRIEF</strong></p> <p>Liverpool's Gary McAllister has won the Carling player of the month award for April. The manager of the month award went, for the second successive month, to Leeds manager David O'Leary. </p> <p>Watford have confirmed that Ray Wilkins and Steve Coppell will move to Vicarage Road to join new manager Gianluca Vialli's backroom team.</p> <p>Everton have unveiled a statue at Goodison in tribute to their greatest ever player Dixie Dean.</p> <p><strong>TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO</strong></p> <p>ITV: World Football (3.10am) </p> <p>There was loads of live Premiership football on last weekend. Of course, you had a full diary then, meaning you couldn't watch any of it.</p> <p>Sky Sports 1: Premier League Preview (12midnight) </p> <p>This weekend? Nothing planned. And what's on?

      "bodyText": "ACTION TIME Forget talk of Queens Park Dons and Shepherd's Bush Wombles. It ain't gonna happen. The proposed merger between QPR and Wimbledon is sinking faster than the crafty, crooked, corrupt and corpulent frame (yes, the thesaurus is out) of the late, fat Robert Maxwell - and it can't be long before the plan joins the sweaty schemer's attempt to merge Oxford and Reading on football's seabed. \"The merger isn't going to happen,\" QPR 1st spokesman Libby Magrill told the Fiver today. \"We met with Chris Wright yesterday, and although he wasn't that keen on the idea anymore anyway, we helped to persuade him that it was an awful plan.\" Better still, Libby reckons the deal could be pronounced dead within 48 hours. \"The Wimbledon Supporters Association will meeting with Charles Koppel on Sunday, and I think it'll be dead by then.\" So make that 1-0 to direct action. But now another challenge awaits: getting ITV to show Leeds's Big Cup semi-final second-leg match against Valencia next Tuesday. Today the Fiver found out there's nothing in ITV's contract to stop them showing the game, providing obscure digital channel ONdigital allows them to do so. Seeing as ITV companies Granada and Carlton own ONdigital, that shouldn't be a problem. But guess what? \"This isn't the sort of thing that supporters like to hear, but the reason why companies spend a lot of money on rights is to encourage people to subscribe to our services,\" brayed blas\u00e9 ONdigital spokesperson Andrew Marr today. And as we cowered, Marr - not to be confused with the BBC's political editor, who wouldn't hurt a fly - followed up his attack with the thundering: \"We have paid a lot of money for these rights, so why should we give them away? If they want to see the game they can go to our website and find a pub showing the game.\" Indeed. Indeed. And you wonder why nobody watches your rubbish channel. CANTONAESQUE Six years ago, Eric Cantona jumped over the advertising hoardings at Selhurst Park and stuck his fist into the loud ignorant mouth of Matthew Simmonds. Echoes of that incident could be heard bouncing around the walls of Brentford's Griffin Park ground last night, as Luton defender Jude Stirling was arrested after allegedly attacking a Brentford fan who is said to have shouted racist abuse during a match. The incident occurred with Stirling sitting in the dug-out watching his team play out a 2-2 draw with their hosts. Luton boss Joe Kinnear takes up the story: \"The fan was throwing racial abuse at Liam George throughout the game. The guy came up with one hand in his pocket and walked up to Jude's face and said something highly offensive and disgraceful. Jude said he thought [the fan] might have had something in his pocket - maybe a knife or something like that - he didn't know what to do so he felt he was defending himself and gave him a right-hander.\" Sure enough, it wasn't long before the police put a stop to the affair and took Stirling down to Chiswick nick, where they discussed the matter at some length with him before turfing him out at 3.30am. \"A man has been bailed to return to police on June 5 pending further inquiries in connection with an alleged assault,\" said a Scotland Yard spokesman, who confirmed that a 33-year-old man had been injured but no charges had been brought. \"We are looking at video footage from the ground.\" While Stirling must wait to find out his fate, Kinnear has promised to \"do the best I can to support the kid\", claiming: \"One doesn't like to see any sort of violence at football matches but Jude reacted in the same manner that I would have done myself.\" That's nearly a Hegelian dialectic. Er, we think. QUOTE OF THE DAY \"One or two situations are progressing quite well regarding new signings\" - Could this be a return to the situation situation for Tottenham manager Glenn Hoddle? ELEMENTARY, IT'S WATSON Never change a winning formula, that's what they say. Who they are we're not sure, and why we should trust them we don't know. But we do. As, indeed, do Tranmere Rovers, who having already enjoyed years of amazing success with an angry-looking shouty bloke who spent most of his life on Merseyside in charge, have gone and appointed another as their new manager. Step forward, former Everton defender and formidable frowning man Dave Watson, and become the latest man to make rash promises that will be regretted six months down the line. \"It's to be known straight away that the target is promotion,\" the 39-year-old began. \"There's no time for consolidation because the squad of players that we have are well capable of challenging for promotion,\" he continued. \"I've already seen quite a few Tranmere games this season. And a lot of what I have seen has been Tranmere have playing quite well but giving away silly goals or missing easy chances,\" he went on, almost making it sound as though he'd been doing nothing at all for the last year or so. And although Watson comes fresh from Goodison Park where he's been coaching the players, nothing is probably exactly what he's been doing. Well, have you seen Everton play recently? Nevertheless, he's not totally without management experience, having been put in charge at Goodison for six weeks in 1997 during one of the club's very many crises. \"I throughly enjoyed that and I'm looking forward to having the chance here,\" he reminisced. What price on him facing his old team in a league derby come season 2002/3, do you think? THE RUMOUR MILL Midas Soccer reckons that Sol Campbell won't be moving to Barcelona - yet. They claim \"all the talk at the Lane is that Sol will sign a one-year deal and see what happens in Glenn Hoddle's first full season in charge.\" The website also reports that Hoddle is planning a \u00a32m move for Quinton Fortune. Meanwhile, Teddy Sheringham has rejected United's offer of a one-year contract and a move to Fulham - and is set to sign a lucrative two-year deal with Spurs. Liverpool are planning a \u00a36m bid for Gareth Southgate. NEWS IN BRIEF Liverpool's Gary McAllister has won the Carling player of the month award for April. The manager of the month award went, for the second successive month, to Leeds manager David O'Leary. Watford have confirmed that Ray Wilkins and Steve Coppell will move to Vicarage Road to join new manager Gianluca Vialli's backroom team. Everton have unveiled a statue at Goodison in tribute to their greatest ever player Dixie Dean. TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO ITV: World Football (3.10am) There was loads of live Premiership football on last weekend. Of course, you had a full diary then, meaning you couldn't watch any of it.

Set a target for London to create 10,000 jobs in new green businesses by 2005 Tony Hillman, information officer at regeneration charity Urban Forum: \"Regeneration matters in the London area fall within the remit of the LDA. Although it has made a reasonable start, there is a concern over whether it has effectively got to grips with the capital's voluntary and community sector. The economic development strategy for London produced by the LDA completed its consultation at the end of February and has to be approved by the new director of strategy, Greg Clark, who starts his job in June. Voluntary sector bodies in the capital have given it a cautious welcome. We welcome the clear link between economic development and social exclusion that runs through the strategy document and the recognition of the need to improve London's deprived areas. Some voluntary groups are suspicious of the drive to make London a 'world city' - something Ken Livingstone is keen on - because they fear the needs of ordinary Londoners will get left behind. The GLA is slowly gearing up to its scrutiny role - indeed in the wake of the Damilola Taylor murder it has recently announced a 'major investigation' into whether regeneration schemes are helping deprived areas as they are supposed to. It may be fairer to judge the mayor and assembly in a year's time when they have settled into their role.\"",

After the impressive Andrew Strauss and Shah had put on 74 for the third wicket, Middlesex managed only 51 from the last 10 overs. Golding dismissed Strauss with his first ball of the season and Matthew Fleming put the seal on a disciplined Kent bowling performance with three wickets from four deliveries in the final over. If only the Kent batsmen had followed their bowlers' example.",

      "bodyText": "The man accused of killing Jill Dando had \"an exaggerated interest\" in television stars and guns, the Old Bailey heard today. The jury heard how Miss Dando, 37, was killed by a single bullet through her head as she crouched outside the front door of her home in Gowan Avenue, Fulham, south-west London, at around 11.30am on April 26 1999. Mr George, who is unemployed, denies murder. \"Nobody witnessed the attack. Within a short time a number of people saw her slumped and bleeding in the porchway,\" said Orlando Pownall, prosecuting. He told the court that Mr George had obsessive personality traits, including an exaggerated interest in well-known figures, whose success he aspired to emulate, the army, weapons and the media. \"Each of these aspects to his character is significant and relevant to this case,\" said Mr Pownall. Mr George had allegedly changed his name a number of times and adopted the names or original surnames of some of those whom he most admired. Over the years, the court was told, he had called himself Steve Majors, which was derived from Lee Majors, who starred as a stuntman and in a series known as the Bionic Man and Steve Austin whose part he played. \"He also knew himself as Thomas Palmer, after one of the SAS soldiers who achieved fame when he was involved in the Iranian Embassy siege. \"More recently the defendant claimed that he was Freddie Mercury's cousin and chose to be known as Barry Bulsara, after the original surname of Mercury, the former lead singer of Queen who died in November, 1991.\" Mr George was born in Hammersmith and lived for 10 years in a ground-floor flat about 500 yards from Gowan Avenue. Before the case was opened Mr Justice Gage told the jury of seven women and five men that Mr George would sit with a helper, as he suffered from bouts of epilepsy. Also in court was Miss Dando's former fianc\u00e9, Alan Farthing, her brother, Nigel, her fellow presenter, Nick Ross, and Mr George's sister, Michelle Diskin. Mr Pownall said that the defendant \"retained an unusual interest in the BBC\" after working there as messenger for five months in 1976. Mr George also bought copies of the Radio Times, while documents seized from his flat contained references to telephone numbers at the BBC. Police developed films found at the address and discovered that there were photographs of the television when there were presenters and newscasters appearing, Mr Pownall said. The QC went on: \"In interview he suggested that he had not heard of Jill Dando before her death and did not know what she looked like. \"Such a suggestion was patently false.\" \"When arrested he claimed that he would not have recognised her if he had seen her in the street and yet after the shooting he told a woman that he knew somebody famous in Gowan Avenue, 'a very special lady',\" Mr Pownall said. He told another woman that he disliked the BBC because of the way that it treated the Queen singer, the jury was told. The case continues.

But moderates believe it will send out a reactionary and exclusive message.</p> <p>\"It is aimed at the party strategists' mums,\" one said despairingly, \"and it will do nothing to shore up our support in metropolitan areas where we look like doing even worse than last time.\"</p> <p>Moderates are dismayed that the manifesto, which was finalised by the shadow cabinet yesterday, will include a specific commitment to section 28, the legislation banning local authorities from promoting homosexuality in schools, which Labour is committed to repeal.</p> <p>The ban has long been a focus of discontent on the left of the party, who fear it can be taken as a symbol of the party's narrow, homophobic outlook and it was specifically attacked by Shaun Woodward when he defected to Labour.</p> <p>The moderates believe that in cities, especially London where the Tories lost 24 seats to Labour - including Michael Portillo's - the race row will have already damaged the party's chances of regaining marginals, and a perceived anti-gay bias will only worsen the situation.</p> <p>Mr Hague confirmed that the future of the pound will dominate the Tory campaign.</p> <p>After prolonged debate among strategists over how the euro issue should be played, it emerged yesterday that the most sceptical approach has won.</p> <p>The plan now is to devote two thirds of days left before polling day to the issue. Mr Hague told party workers: \"The decision to scrap the pound has already been taken by Labour and their Liberal allies.

      "bodyText": "Tory moderates have lost their fight to influence the party's manifesto and are preparing a post-election assault on party policy. One leading moderate declared yesterday: \"On June 8, the party's soul is up for grabs.\" The party leader William Hague, who took personal control of the drafting process to toughen up the party programme, told staff in a pre-campaign pep talk at Conservative central office yesterday that it would be \"the most radical and far-reaching programme for a generation\". But moderates believe it will send out a reactionary and exclusive message. \"It is aimed at the party strategists' mums,\" one said despairingly, \"and it will do nothing to shore up our support in metropolitan areas where we look like doing even worse than last time.\" Moderates are dismayed that the manifesto, which was finalised by the shadow cabinet yesterday, will include a specific commitment to section 28, the legislation banning local authorities from promoting homosexuality in schools, which Labour is committed to repeal. The ban has long been a focus of discontent on the left of the party, who fear it can be taken as a symbol of the party's narrow, homophobic outlook and it was specifically attacked by Shaun Woodward when he defected to Labour. The moderates believe that in cities, especially London where the Tories lost 24 seats to Labour - including Michael Portillo's - the race row will have already damaged the party's chances of regaining marginals, and a perceived anti-gay bias will only worsen the situation. Mr Hague confirmed that the future of the pound will dominate the Tory campaign. After prolonged debate among strategists over how the euro issue should be played, it emerged yesterday that the most sceptical approach has won. The plan now is to devote two thirds of days left before polling day to the issue. Mr Hague told party workers: \"The decision to scrap the pound has already been taken by Labour and their Liberal allies. I say the Conservatives will keep the pound and this may be your last chance to save it.\" He also highlighted tax cuts, education and law and order as likely battlegrounds and tried to boost morale by reminding workers that the Tories won the European elections in 1999 with a 36% share of the vote, even though polls showed them with only 17.5%. Local election results since then showed the party was still outperforming its opinion poll standing, while Labour's share of the vote, at 32%, was well below its poll rating. In another sign of the battle lines in the aftermath of a Tory defeat, the leading Conservative pro-European, Ian Taylor, is to chair the European Movement.

The chief executive of the Snowdonia national park authority, Iwan Huws, was marking the occasion by walking to the top of the 1,085-metre peak - the highest in England and Wales. The Snowdon massif, in the heart of north Wales, was closed to the public on February 27 and was a designated infected area until April 18. Following the reopening, walkers will still be obliged to disinfect footwear at the start and end of their excursion.</p> <p>Ramblers' Association spokesperson Jacquetta Fewster welcomed the move.</p> <p>She said: \"It's great that more of the countryside is being reopened, particularly in such a beautiful area. But there are still thousands of miles of footpaths that remain needlessly closed. The Ramblers' Association urges all local authorities to encourage the public back into the countryside by opening up paths in line with recent government advice.\"</p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/list\">Full list: outbreaks</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,464555,00.html\">Graph: rise in cases</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,460510,00.html\">Full list: closed &amp; cancelled</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\">Causes and effects</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theissues/article/0,6512,474590,00.html\">Explained: vaccination</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/theissues/0,6514,180991,00.html\">Explained: the risk to human health</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theissues/article/0,6512,441031,00.html\">Explained: pigswill's contribution to foot and mouth</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,471911,00.html\">Foot and mouth in Europe</a></p> <p><b>The front line: meet those affected by the crisis</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,475723,00.html\">20.04.2001: The jab of conscience</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html\">06.03.2001: Meet our panel</a><br> </p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,485667,00.html\">04.05.2001: Phoenix rises from the wings</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/footandmouth/story/0,7369,485304,00.html\">03.05.2001: 'End in sight' for foot and mouth</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/footandmouth/story/0,7369,482215,00.html\">02.05.2001: Blair sees end to foot and mouth and prepares to call election</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/footandmouth/story/0,7369,481335,00.html\">01.05.2001: Foot and mouth costs charity \u00a311m</a></p> <p><b>Interactive guides</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/flash/0,7365,443772,00.html\">How the virus spread across Britain</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/country/flash/0,6189,191473,00.html\">The countryside in crisis</a></p> <p><b>More on the countryside in crisis</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463746,00.html\">27.03.2001: Hard times</a></p> <p><b>More on the election and foot and mouth</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/footandmouth\">Politics: foot and mouth</a></p> <p><b>From the Guardian archive</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463588,00.html\">28.11.1967, leader: indecision on foot and mouth</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463571,00.html\">18.11.1967: 'Slaughter must seem a cruel remedy'</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463578,00.html\">16.11.1967: Foot and mouth may cost agriculture more than \u00a312m</a></p> <p><b>Graphics</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,443231,00.html\">Map: The spread of the disease (week 4)</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,443231,00.html\">Map of confirmed cases so far</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,441929,00.html\">Computerised image of the virus</a><br></p> <p><b>Cartoons</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,478723,00.html\">26.04.2001: Martin Rowson on the death of satire</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,464422,00.html\">28.03.2001: Steve Bell on how pigs will fly</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,463874,00.html\">29.03.2001: Steve Bell on Hague going over the top</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,443237,00.html\">The story in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br> <a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7f681\">What do you think?</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth\">Foot and mouth</a><br> <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/footandmouth/\">Election 2001: foot and mouth</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/food/\">What's wrong with our food?</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/bse/\">BSE</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/country/0,2759,181093,00.html\">Countryside in crisis</a></p> <p><b>Net notes</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/netnotes/article/0,6729,440983,00.html\">Pigs -

The chief executive of the Snowdonia national park authority, Iwan Huws, was marking the occasion by walking to the top of the 1,085-metre peak - the highest in England and Wales. The Snowdon massif, in the heart of north Wales, was closed to the public on February 27 and was a designated infected area until April 18. Following the reopening, walkers will still be obliged to disinfect footwear at the start and end of their excursion. Ramblers' Association spokesperson Jacquetta Fewster welcomed the move. She said: \"It's great that more of the countryside is being reopened, particularly in such a beautiful area. But there are still thousands of miles of footpaths that remain needlessly closed. The Ramblers' Association urges all local authorities to encourage the public back into the countryside by opening up paths in line with recent government advice.\" What's going on?

      "bodyText": "A woman who tried to sue the Sunday Mirror over a lookalike picture has lost her case. Londoner Kerry O'Shea, 24, had brought a claim for libel over an advertisement for an adults-only website. The advert appeared in the Sunday Mirror on five occasions last summer and used pictures of several women. Ms O'Shea alleged one woman, shown holding a telephone receiver to her ear, looked almost identical to her. Mr Justice Morland said if the photograph in question had been a true photograph of Ms O'Shea, whom he described as a \"respectable young woman\", she would undoubtedly have won her case. But he dismissed her claim saying it would place an \"impossible burden\" on the media if they were forced to look out for such cases in the future. Ms O'Shea claimed the ad suggested she \"was appearing or performing on a highly pornographic website containing material of an explicit, indecent and lewd nature and had shamelessly agreed to promote this website and her own appearance on it in a national newspaper\". The judge was told the picture was of a well-known glamour model, known as \"Miss E\", who allowed her photo to appear in sex industry adverts. Ms O'Shea's action against Mirror Group Newspapers and Free4Internet.Net was the first libel case involving lookalikes in English law.

      "bodyText": "Luton Town defender Jude Stirling was on police bail today after allegedly attacking a fan who is said to have shouted racist abuse during a match. Stirling was arrested at last night's 2-2 draw with Division Two rivals Brentford. The 18-year-old was not playing but watching the match from the Luton dug-out at Brentford's ground, Griffin Park, west London. Witnesses said a Brentford supporter was yelling racist abuse at black players on the pitch when Stirling allegedly intervened. Luton manager Joe Kinnear said: \"The fan was throwing racial abuse at Liam George throughout the game - the guy came up with one hand in his pocket and walked up to Jude's face and said something highly offensive and disgraceful. \"Jude said he thought he (the fan) might have had something in his pocket - maybe a knife or something like that - he didn't know what to do so he felt he was defending himself and gave him a right-hander. \"There was the most severe provocation. \"I can't see how the fan was allowed to get to the players' dug-out. I don't know if there was that many stewards around there or not. \"This fellow had been throwing abuse at Ron Noades all night - he turned his abuse onto Liam George and then onto Stirling so he was obviously out looking for aggravation. \"One doesn't like to see any sort of violence at football matches but Jude reacted in the same manner that I would have done myself.\" Kinnear said that Stirling - considered a rising star at the club - was taken to Chiswick police station, where he was released at 3.30am today. \"I shall be doing the best I can to support the kid and we will now wait and see what comes back from the police, and indeed the FA,\" he added. Scotland Yard said a 33-year-old man had been injured but no charges had been brought. \"A man has been bailed to return to police on June 5 pending further inquiries in connection with an alleged assault,\" said a spokesman. \"We are looking at video footage from the ground.\"",

      "bodyText": "ITV bosses were today glossing over the loss of Richard and Judy and insisting This Morning would continue, following the couple's bombshell decision to quit the show after 13 years. They said it was business as usual for daytime television and the priority was to find two new presenters. ITV's head of daytime TV, Maureen Duffy, said: \"Richard and Judy have made a terrific contribution to ITV over the past 13 years and we wish them well in the future.\" Making her feelings felt about the future of the show, she added: \"They leave This Morning, Britain's most popular daytime TV show, in great shape.\" The departure of Richard and Judy will leave a gaping hole in ITV's armour. Together they kept the show alive - they were notorious for maintaining control of the content of the show, making producers' lives difficult, but kept the show topical and attractive to viewers. Over the past 13 years the couple has been invincible in the ratings, seeing off all rivals including the BBC's Anne Diamond with a regular audience of 2m. Richard and Judy told few people of their decision to leave, although reports that they were unhappy at ITV surfaced as far back as February. It is believed that the Granada programming boss, Grant Mansfield, was made aware of their decision only recently. Others on the show, including the producers, co-presenters and publicity officers, were kept out of the loop until the deal was announced this morning. \"I know people always say it wasn't a question of money, but genuinely this time it was,\" said one source. \"It is a bit of a bombshell all round.\" It is believed just three people at Channel 4 knew of the negotiations - Jo McGrath, the commissioning editor of daytime TV; the programme director, Tim Gardam; and the chief executive, Michael Jackson, who will have sanctioned the multimillion pound payout for the stars. Ms McGrath was talking to independent producers about ideas for late afternoon when Amanda Ross, the head of Cactus TV - a subsidiary of Chrysalis - suggested an approach for Richard and Judy. It only became clear at 8pm last night that a deal was going to be signed this morning. Channel 4 executives are delighted with their scoop - the station has been flagging in the ratings ever since Anne Robinson's Weakest Link on BBC2 took off. The BBC quiz show was pulling in up to 5m viewers - 2m more than Countdown on occasions. Related story 04.05.2001: Richard and Judy in shock departure",

Captain Mainwaring: he's cultured, debonair. If we can get him, it's Nicholas Parsons. [Memo to casting director: can Nicholas do accents?] </p> <p>One starry evening, Keith is wandering through the fields in a soft, silken Barbour jacket. A sweet sound permeates the constant gunfire - it's a song, a song that takes her back to the time when her own parents would sing to her: it's I've Got A Brand New Combine Harvester, a rousing patriotic anthem. In the faint half-light of a smouldering pyre, she sees its source: Parsons, proud and erect in disinfected leather wellies, blowing and sucking gently on his harmonica. Their eyes meet. Cattle low. The smoke clears. </p> <p>[I think you're getting the picture, Chris - romantic but NOT TACKY]</p> <p>It's forbidden love. She wants him yet distrusts him; she can't ignore Parsons' charms but can't quite forget what his cohorts did to the family goat. </p> <p>[Note from Melvyn: would a bodice-ripping scene on a muddy country lane work here?] </p> <p>Then Parsons is sent off to cull in counties far and wide. Months pass. But he never forgets. Finally he returns. He tiptoes over the cattle grid to Keith's farm and spies his love in the distance. The old flames start to burn again - it's another disease-ridden sheep being laid to rest. But Parsons sees, next to his love, another man, dressed in white overalls. </p> <p>Keith turns and walks into the cowshed. The man in overalls follows. Parsons thinks it can only mean one thing: weeping, he walks away - though he will never forget.</p> <p>Cut to cowshed. Shots ring out. An embittered Keith has slaughtered the man in overalls. It has all been a tragic misunderstanding. The credits roll.</p> <p>NB Melvyn thinks this might be a little too downbeat for an American audience, and has come up with an alternative ending:</p> <p>Keith spots Parsons in the distance. Jumping on her prize stud bull, she gallops towards him. Parsons leaps on behind and, his hair flowing in the wind, they ride out, ignoring the no entry signs on footpaths. As they ride, they notice a new breed of strong and healthy cows coming over the hill. Men from Maff lay down their overalls. Farmers embrace. The theme from Last of the Summer Wine plays. Love has triumphed, and the countryside is safe once more.</p>",

And then she sees him: the man from Maff, a townie, but different from the rest. Captain Mainwaring: he's cultured, debonair. If we can get him, it's Nicholas Parsons. [Memo to casting director: can Nicholas do accents?] One starry evening, Keith is wandering through the fields in a soft, silken Barbour jacket. A sweet sound permeates the constant gunfire - it's a song, a song that takes her back to the time when her own parents would sing to her: it's I've Got A Brand New Combine Harvester, a rousing patriotic anthem. In the faint half-light of a smouldering pyre, she sees its source: Parsons, proud and erect in disinfected leather wellies, blowing and sucking gently on his harmonica. Their eyes meet. Cattle low. The smoke clears. [I think you're getting the picture, Chris - romantic but NOT TACKY] It's forbidden love. She wants him yet distrusts him; she can't ignore Parsons' charms but can't quite forget what his cohorts did to the family goat. [Note from Melvyn: would a bodice-ripping scene on a muddy country lane work here?] Then Parsons is sent off to cull in counties far and wide. Months pass. But he never forgets. Finally he returns. He tiptoes over the cattle grid to Keith's farm and spies his love in the distance. The old flames start to burn again - it's another disease-ridden sheep being laid to rest. But Parsons sees, next to his love, another man, dressed in white overalls. Keith turns and walks into the cowshed. The man in overalls follows. Parsons thinks it can only mean one thing: weeping, he walks away - though he will never forget. Cut to cowshed. Shots ring out. An embittered Keith has slaughtered the man in overalls. It has all been a tragic misunderstanding. The credits roll. NB Melvyn thinks this might be a little too downbeat for an American audience, and has come up with an alternative ending: Keith spots Parsons in the distance. Jumping on her prize stud bull, she gallops towards him. Parsons leaps on behind and, his hair flowing in the wind, they ride out, ignoring the no entry signs on footpaths. As they ride, they notice a new breed of strong and healthy cows coming over the hill. Men from Maff lay down their overalls. Farmers embrace. The theme from Last of the Summer Wine plays. Love has triumphed, and the countryside is safe once more.",

      "bodyText": "The government was today ordered to pay \u00a310,000 to each of the families of 10 IRA men shot dead by police and troops in Northern Ireland after judges in Europe ruled the terrorists' human rights had been violated. They include relatives of eight heavily-armed Provisionals ambushed by the SAS as they retreated from a gun and bomb attack which destroyed a police station. In four separate cases considered by the European court of human rights - involving the deaths of 10 IRA men, a Sinn Fein member and a civilian - seven judges ruled unanimously that Article 2 of the Human Rights Convention guaranteeing a right to life had been violated. Lawyers claimed excessive force was used and that a so-called shoot to kill policy had been sanctioned by the government and security chiefs. As jubilant relatives immediately demanded the RUC officers and soldiers involved be charged with murder, one of the legal representatives said: \"It is a reminder to the government, even in the midst of conflict, they cannot step outside the rule of law.\" Outraged Unionist hardliners denounced the ruling and urged the government not to pay up. Ulster Unionist leader and Northern Ireland first minister, David Trimble, said the ruling was astonishing and perverse. But it is a huge victory for the families who claimed the way was now clear for relatives of other people shot dead by the security forces in disputed circumstances to take the same action. Eight of the IRA men were shot dead in an undercover operation at Loughgall, Co Armagh in l987, when a civilian passer-by also died. Two other IRA men were gunned down by police in separate shootings in Belfast and near Lurgan, Co Armagh, in l982 and l992. The 12th victim, a member of Sinn Fein, was shot dead by loyalist paramilitary gunmen in Co Tyrone in l991. Mairead Kelly, whose brother Patrick was among the IRA men killed by the SAS at Loughgall, said the government had been indicted in front of the rest of the world. She said: \"It is time the British got off the high moral ground and stopped lecturing people about human rights. \"The British have now been found guilty in front of the world and seen to be one of the biggest violators of all.\" A spokesman for Tony Blair said the government may appeal against the judgment, but wanted time to study it. He said there was no finding of unlawful killing, which meant the court had not found evidence of a \"shoot to kill\" policy.

      "bodyText": "Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan, the king and queen of daytime television, have sensationally quit ITV after a run of almost 13 years. They have shocked bosses at ITV by announcing they are to present a new evening show on Channel 4. The married couple, who have come to epitomise daytime TV, have become part of the ITV furniture over the past decade with a cult following among housewives and students alike for their This Morning show. It is understood they told virtually no one at ITV or Granada of their decision until recently. In a statement, Madeley said: \"Judy and I have enjoyed 13 wonderful series of This Morning and we will be incredibly sad to say goodbye to all our colleagues at Granada and ITV.\" Finnigan denied there had been a \"tug of war\" for the couple. She added: \"We have just decided that we want to try something different and Channel 4 represents a brilliant opportunity to explore a new direction.\" The show, with its mix of lifestyle hints, sofa chat and therapy, has become cult viewing and Madeley and Finnigan have been daily tabloid fodder for years. And audiences seem to love them all the more for their numerous gaffes. Last year Finnigan made the front page of all the national newspapers when she revealed her ample bosom to the world's media at the National Television Awards. Last month Madeley was forced to issue an on-air apology after claiming that Roobarb and Custard creator Bob Godfrey \"had to be on drugs\". Their popularity has made them a constant subject of attention - the highest point of their tabloid career was the revelation that Madeley had been arrested for shoplifting wine from a supermarket. Their fanbase runs to millions and they have recently been paid the ultimate accolade with an impersonation by the BBC's Alistair McGowan. And there have been repeated questions about Judy's health. Channel 4's raid has caught everybody by surprise because Madeley and Finnigan, who have long been associated with the daytime heartlands of ITV. But Channel 4 has tended to stray from such mass fodder. The Channel 4 director of programmes, Tim Gardam, said the deal \"will reinforce Channel 4's market leader status in afternoon and early evening television\".",

      "bodyText": "The government has made key concessions over two of the most controversial parts of its health and social care bill in order to ease its passage through parliament before the general election. Ministers last night caved in to pressure from local authorities and withdrew plans which would give them the power to force failing social services and community services providers into care trusts. In the face of pressure from Conservative peers, they also scrapped a proposal to control the use of anonymised patient data by pharmaceutical companies. But they refused to give way on plans to give the health secretary powers to sanction the use of confidential patient information without patient consent where it is in the \"public interest,\" such as for use by cancer research bodies. The concessions follow a government defeat in the Lords last month over its plans to abolish community health councils (CHCs) - although ministers said they will reverse this defeat in the Commons. Health minister Lord Hunt told the House of Lords last night that the government had \"thought again\" about making care trusts compulsory in the light of peers' concerns. \"We have concluded that the best way to respond to those concerns is to withdraw the proposals for compulsory care trusts,\" he said. Local authorities have been doggedly opposed to care trusts because of fears that they will effectively fold social services into an NHS-dominated management structure. Although they have failed to prevent the creation of care trusts, the concession over plans to impose them will be welcomed by local government as a significant compromise by ministers. The change means that local authorities and NHS bodies will not be dragooned into care trusts where local services have failed and cannot be improved within existing arrangements. But Lord Hunt added that the government would not shirk from taking corrective action against failing services. \"Although we agree that compulsory care trusts may not be the right approach, the amendments that I propose leave intact the powers to require the use of the health act partnership in response to service failure.\" The government had sought to control the use of anonymised patient data by drugs companies because of concerns that their use of the information to market their products to GPs would lead to unneccessarily high prescribing bills. Lord Hunt made it clear that the government was reluctantly prepared to back down over the clause because it had received assurances from the pharmaceutical industry that it would use the data \"responsibly\". He said: \"We will not hesitate to take action, including legislation should that prove neccessary in the future to protect the NHS and its clinicians from unacceptable commercial pressures.\" Lord Hunt rejected opposition arguments that proposals to give the health secretary power to sanction use of confidential patient information in the public interest would drive a \"coach and horses\" through the \"established order of medical ethics\". But he outlined plans to set up a statutory advisory committee to strengthen the safeguards against potential abuse of the powers.",

      "bodyText": "ITV are refusing to show live coverage of the Champions League semi-final second-leg match between Leeds and Valencia next Tuesday - even though they have the power to do so. The news has provoked outrage from Leeds fans and the Football Supporters Association, who have demanded the channel show the club's biggest game in 26 years. The match will go out live on ONdigital - with ITV showing highlights later on in the evening. However, Guardian Unlimited has learned there is nothing in ITV's contract with Uefa that stops them showing the game. Uefa spokesman Thomas Giordano said: \"Under our contract with ITV, they are allowed to show the Valencia v Leeds match live, providing they also show Wednesday's game and get the agreement of ONdigital.\" As two ITV companies - Granada and Carlton - own ONdigital, this shouldn't be a problem. However, both Granada and Carlton have refused to intervene. They say ONdigital is a completely separate entity and will be keeping the rights to show the game for themselves. FSA chairman Malcolm Clarke told Guardian Unlimited he was \"amazed\" at the news. \"This is a huge European match which football fans across the country want to watch,\" he added. \"Instead it's been shoved away on a minor channel. \"Our view is that everyone should be able to see the game - not just the few with access to ONdigital.\" Leeds fan Andy Summer agreed. \"I bet if it was Manchester United, ITV would be showing the game live,\" he said. ONdigital have responded to the criticism by telling irate fans to subscribe - or watch the game in the pub. Spokesman Andrew Marr said: \"This isn't the sort of thing that supporters like to hear - but the reason why companies spend a lot of money on rights is to encourage people to subscribe to our services. \"We have paid a lot of money for these rights, so why should we give them away? If they want to see the game they can go to our website and find a pub showing the game.\" Meanwhile, ITV spokesman Paul Tyrell insisted that the FSA - and those Leeds fans angry at not being able to see the game - should remember the positive aspects of the TV deal. \"I know a lot of fans will be disappointed not seeing the game,\" he admitted. \"But without the additional coverage on the digital and satellite companies the clubs wouldn't be receiving such a cash windfall from the Champions League. \"And without that extra money, it's debatable whether Leeds could have afforded \u00a318m for Rio Ferdinand and \u00a312m for Robbie Keane,\" he added.",

      "bodyText": "Sir Christopher Bland, the newly installed chairman of British Telecom, is set for his first clash of interests with the BBC after the telecoms group emerged as a potential bidder for the licence fee collection contract. Sir Christopher sparked controversy earlier this week when he assumed control of BT without resigning from his post as chairman of the publicly funded broadcaster. Critics of the move claimed that having the same person in charge of two of the UK's most powerful communications companies was bound to create a conflict of interest. The news that the BBC is to approach private sector companies with a \u00a3500m contract to gather the licence fee will add fuel to the debate, as BT is understood to have sounded out the corporation about the contract. A BBC spokeswoman confirmed the corporation had been contacted about the contract by several interested parties, but refused to confirm if BT was one of the potential bidders. \"People have registered their interests, and a large number of different organisations have contacted us. It would be unfair to single out any of the parties involved,\" she said. A decision on the contract is expected to be reached in September. The BBC is revamping the way it collects the licence fee in a bid to cut costs and boost revenues from a levy that raises \u00a32.3bn a year. The corporation has used the Post Office - now known as Consignia - as the cornerstone of the collection process for the past 75 years. But it has grown frustrated with the \u00a3120m lost to licence fee evasion each year. The BBC decided to approach the private sector after the contract ended with Consignia and its partner, advertising giant WP. Greg Dyke, the director general of the BBC, hopes a private firm will crack down on evasion and carry out the collection at a lower cost, saving \u00a360m a year. This will go some way to meeting Mr Dyke's target of finding an extra \u00a3200m per year until 2006 as part of the government's funding shake-up. Other likely bidders include the utility group Centrica and more than a dozen advertising companies. BT refused to comment on the news.

      "bodyText": "\"That's the pub where the police arrested Oswald Mosley in 1940.\" The retired foreign office mandarin was leaning over his garden fence and pointing at The Shaven Crown in Shipton-under-Wychwood. \"Apparently Shaun Woodward drinks there now.\" I made some cheap crack about \"the police not bothering to arrest traitors these days\" and went on my way. This snippet was just one of the useful pieces of information I have gleaned in the past week. Others include the fact that West Oxfordshire has its own vineyard and the constituency is stuffed full of cats' homes, including the superbly named Paws with Inn. What on earth has this Tory candidate been doing? Far from wandering the byways of Oxfordshire grinning inanely at potential voters, I have been engaged in what Jack Straw would probably call \"purposeful activity.\" The \"phoney election\" period caused by Blair's entirely correct (but belated) decision to postpone the general election left a gaping hole in many candidates' diaries. There is only so much time that can be spent buffing the campaign bus and polishing the opening press release, so I made the rash decision to jump on a bicycle and undertake a sponsored bicycle ride to all 85 parishes in the Witney constituency. 5 days, 220 miles, 85 rain-soaked villages, 2 aching limbs and 1 muddy bike later I have finished and \u00a34,000 will be finding its way to a politically balanced list of good causes including one of the farmers' benevolent funds, an animal charity, a local school and the Macmillan Cancer Nurses. My local Conservative agent is still chuckling. He applauded my determination, but worries about my naivety: not knowing that \"bike\" is slang for prostitute, my press release announcing this caper opened with the quote: \"I haven't been on a bike for years.\" Looking back, I can see his point. But there is a serious side to this. What did I learn apart from the fact that Jack Straw actually lives in Minster Lovell, hundreds of miles from his Burnley constituency, and that the Cotswolds are full of painfully steep hills? In short, this: Tony Blair has taken a big risk in announcing that foot and mouth is \"over\" and the countryside is \"open\". My experience was very different. Oxfordshire has only suffered two cases of foot and mouth, but farmers, rural business and the local councils have taken every precaution to stop the disease spreading. As long as there are fresh cases breaking out anywhere in the UK, they will rightly remain nervous. On my ride I saw just a handful of footpaths re-opened; most were firmly closed. Parts of some villages are actually behind a foot and mouth no-go sign. Entire roads in two villages I visited were closed to all traffic and pedestrians. The anger also remains. Every publican I spoke to was still spitting blood about the mishandling of the crisis and said their takings were between 20 and 30% down on last year. Of course we all want foot and mouth to be over, footpaths to be open and the countryside to return to normal. But farmers who are still laying disinfected straw at their gates may be forgiven for being cautious. Was the timing of Blair's press conference determined by epidemiology or the need to get on with the election? You don't have to be a hard-bitten Tory cynic to think spin doctors rather than vets have been calling the shots this week in Downing Street. \u00b7 David Cameron is the Conservative candidate for Witney in Oxfordshire Ask Aristotle Witney, Oxfordshire Shaun Woodward",

      "body": "<p>Doing battle with Alison Goldfrapp is not something to be undertaken lightly. Take her recent run-in with a photographer. Goldfrapp, as the band she founded with Will Gregory are called, were on a stage \"about four inches high\" and a photographer was irritating the vocalist and obstructing the crowd's view. Alison, who regards photographers as an occupational hazard in the same way that hardened criminals regard judges, totally lost it. \"I told him to piss off, which was probably very comical. But then something just took over and I tried to lamp the bastard!\" </p> <p>Goldfrapp, incidentally, is all of 5ft 2in tall. She is tough and complex but also insecure - and very funny. When we're introduced, in a French restaurant as dark and decadent as her music, she blanks me completely, barking down her mobile about some other offending lensman: \"He's made me look like a fucking puffy Humpty Dumpty!\" When we finally sit down, she orders two bottles of wine, one each, and advises against eating. </p> <p>Mercifully, she grants me permission to visit the toilet, and winces when I mention her recent photograph in Vogue. \"A classic scenario,\" she sighs. \"You'd think you could rely on Vogue to make you look drop-dead gorgeous. I looked like a fucking drag queen!\" Thus begins a memorable evening with the suddenly very sought-after elfin hurricane, who looks rather more like a mischievous European actress than a drag queen. </p> <p>Last September, Goldfrapp released their debut album, Felt Mountain, to general praise. Critics adored its blend of Weimar Republic cabaret, French pop, lush orchestration and cinematic scope. In a landscape of pop fodder, here was something unusual and different. Now the public is catching on. </p> <p>Slowly but surely, following the pattern set by Moby, their labelmate on Mute, the album has sold 25,000 - a real feat without a hit single (although Utopia, re-released next month, should change that). Marketing has been carried out via press, word of mouth and the odd free track on cover-mounted CDs. In the meantime, the story across Europe has been one of sold-out tours, upgraded venues and general pandemonium - deservedly. Felt Mountain is the early favourite to take this year's Mercury music prize. </p> <p>\"I'm delighted with the attention, but I really don't think we're as commercial as Moby,\" she frets. \"It's been very natural, though, and I like that. I didn't think people would get it in England because we're a bit arty. The Mercury? Oh God, that would be great. I mean, I'm no spring chicken, so recently I've started to think, 'Yeah, I deserve something.' I've been slogging at this for quite a long time. I've had a very weird . . . apprenticeship!\" She laughs, and the untouched mineral water topples from the table. </p> <p>Now in her early 30s, Goldfrapp grew up in Alton, Hampshire, one of those small towns where \"you want to get out. There isn't anything else to do, so you take lots of drugs and get beaten up on a Saturday night.\" She was the \"posh girl who lived in the nice street\". Her father worked for the Arts Council and the Spastics Society, and her mother was a nurse. \"All the mental people would come and see my mum,\" she recalls, \"and usually end up staying.\" </p> <p>The family were considered bohemian and eccentric. Mr Goldfrapp (the name is German: \"Frapp means hit,\" she enjoys telling me) would inflict classical music and opera upon his daughter, conducting from the dinner table. At the time, she says, she preferred David Cassidy. Alison went to convent school and still gets misty-eyed about the endless corridors, austere, black-clad nuns, and stone floors flecked with what looked like glitter. \"I thought I was in a film,\" she says. </p> <p>She says that after being deemed \"academically retarded\" she was forced to leave the convent and was devastated to have to attend the local comp, where she was vilified as the \"snobby little girl from the convent\". Lots of \"horrible things\" happened there, which she doesn't want to expand on. In short, she went seriously off the rails. There were incidents involving borstal boys, glue-sniffing and car theft. Soon afterwards, she departed for London's squats, and her life continued to spiral out of control. </p> <p>If convent school taught her anything, it was that everyone, no matter how stupid they seemed, was good at something. But what? Goldfrapp was interested in music, art, and drama, but combining any of those with temping jobs in telesales was difficult. She spent four years \"living in bedsits and answering ads in Melody Maker\". Because she was young and cute and could sing a bit, friends suggested she could be the next Kylie Minogue. Instead, she went to study art at Middlesex College. \"That was crucial,\" she says. \"They taught me that it doesn't matter whether you have any money - 'the idea' is everything. Also, that I could do music, and that it didn't have to be pop.\" </p> <p>Fired up with a new enthusiasm, she accepted a job singing in Antwerp, Belgium, for a contemporary dance company run by Andy Goldberg, who introduced her to the music of 1950s multi-octave singer Yma Sumac. Goldfrapp was seduced by the \"decadence\" of all things European. Eventually, though, she tired of the \"anal discipline\" involved and sought musical freedom. At the same time, her father died and she split up with a long-term boyfriend. </p> <p>Weirdly enough, everything appears to have taken off for Goldfrapp when she milked a cow, while yodelling (\"I've always liked that Swiss kitsch thing\"). She was exploring performance art at a party, and among the guests were Orbital, who recruited her to sing - not yodel - on their 1994 Snivilisation album. Still grateful, she subsequently worked with Tricky, singing on 1995's seminal Maxinquaye album and touring with him for two years. If her previous experiences were character toughening, this one gave her steel. It was, she insists, \"brilliant\", but left her mentally shattered. </p> <p>\"It took two years for me to get my head back to what I wanted,\" she sighs. \"Things were complex because I was good friends with Martina [Tricky's then partner-vocalist], who I effectively replaced. It was highly acrimonious between those two and I was in the middle. I mean, I like Tricky. As much as he's a fucking nightmare. Offensive? He's totally offensive! But I can give it back.\" Undaunted, she watched Tricky intensely, learning the importance of economy and impulse. \"His best stuff was done in his living room,\" she says. \"I'd be standing in the hallway with one working headphone while he went out for chips. When he came back, the track was done.\" </p> <p>The importance of working instinc tively was underlined when she provided studio backing vocals for Bryan Ferry, \"a perfect gentleman\", but who was prone to indecision and \"endless tweaking\" until eventually nothing was released. However, by now Goldfrapp knew roughly what she wanted. Enter Will Gregory, a composer of film scores best known for ID - the football hooligan film. Gregory came across a tape of Goldfrapp singing Human, which became one of the standout tracks on Felt Mountain. </p> <p>Mailing tapes of their favourite music (Her: Fran\u00e7oise Hardy. Him: Ennio Morricone) to each other, the pair clicked. Oddly, Goldfrapp insists they both think visually: \"What is the scenario behind this song? What are the emotions?\" She like beats, but bossa nova rather than bpm. \"I've been in things where all these guys talked about was fucking bpm!\" she shrieks. \"You know, instead of smoking their eighth spliff in their anorak, I want to hear a tune! Will's exactly the same.\" </p> <p>Turned down by major labels, the pair secured a contract with Mute in August 1999. Finally a label had recognised Goldfrapp's unique vision and her untrained, operatic-sounding voice. At this point, one of the barmier episodes took place. Fuelled by her post-Ferry hatred of studios, she and Will recorded for six months, from September 1999, in a cottage on a Wiltshire hillside, where Alison often found herself alone. </p> <p>\"It was mad and I wouldn't do it again,\" she says. \"My social and private life collapsed. Because it was a bungalow, it felt really vulnerable. Big windows. Mice in the roof. I like extremes but, at the end of that six months, I really did feel I was going bonkers. I remember spending three days in a raincoat, scrubbing the side of the bungalow because there were all these spiders hatching. I became obsessive about the wildlife I thought was taking over the bungalow. It was disgusting, moths everywhere. You could hear the mice scuttling across the roof.\" </p> <p>Mad, but it worked. Felt Mountain has an eerie widescreen, cinematic feel to it. This is partly because it was recorded outside, under the stars, and partly because the feeling of \"total loneliness where something horrible is happening\" reignited fears from her childhood. In fact, her childhood appears all over the album: twitching curtains, slaughter in the countryside, hints of disturbance. \"It's sort of beautifully macabre,\" she muses. \"I love all that David Lynch, Midwich Cuckoos thing. But it isn't cinema. It's real.\" </p> <p>Goldfrapp the band occupy unique territory between mischief and danger, blurring fantasy and reality, though their \"coffee-table\" appeal is undeniable. Alison's lyrics are mostly abstract obsessional tales, using cut-up surrealist techniques. With Will's blessing, she designs their artwork - spooky little birds and limbs in the grass. Felt Mountain's sleeve depicts her head doubled, like a freak show, but also a vagina (\"a computer accident, honestly, but I kept it\"). She confesses to an \"unhealthy\" inter est in voyeurism but insists that the notorious publicity photo of her playing piano in her undergarments (taken, importantly, by her friend Anna) was partly triggered by poverty. \"After six months in the bungalow, I didn't have any nice clothes. My trousers looked like shit. So I took them off!\" </p> <p>She is aware of her sexuality but is amused and uneasy about reviewers dubbing her a \"dominatrix\". She insists that, at heart, she is shy and vulnerable, and comes over as a warm, funny, immensely likeable young woman, who can't watch herself on television, worries about seeming a \"gibbering twit\" in interviews and has endless traumas about her appearance. </p> <p>\"When I was young,\" she says, \"I used to change my appearance three times every day, which drove my mother mad. When I did that Vogue thing, I think I felt that's how I should look. I thought I'd look really sophisticated in a black dress, lots of make-up and fishnet tights. And then I just realised, 'Fucking hell, no!' But I am trying to have fun with it, with all of it.\" </p> <p>Throughout her life, it seems, Goldfrapp has been striving to escape something, to create a parallel fantasy world. And if she does become a big star? \"I don't crave it,\" she insists, before adding words which will alarm photographers everywhere: \"But I'm sure it would be jolly good fun!\" </p> <p>Goldfrapp play London Union Chapel on May 17 and 18 (020-7734 8932) and tour in May and June. Utopia is released by Mute on June 4.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Independent Television Commission is planning to limit the amount of airtime given over to on-air promotions on ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5. The watchdog plans to limit plugs for the broadcasters' own programmes and services to 90 seconds per hour in peaktime. The ITC said it wanted to \"address viewer concerns about promotional and advertising clutter\". The commercial terrestrial broadcasters are likely to resist any moves to limit on-air promotion of their own shows and services. As multi-channel competition for audiences increases, on-air trailers are becoming an ever more important weapon in the battle to hold onto viewers. As part of the review the regulator is asking broadcasters for their views on this issue and plans to allow ITV more freedom to cross-promote its digital channels and services. This could lead to ITV promoting Carlton/Granada-owned pay-TV platform ONdigital, which is to be renamed ITV Digital, and ITV.co.uk - set to be rebranded ITV.com - on its main terrestrial channel. ITV2 and the soon-to-launch ITV Sport Channel would also benefit. \"Such promotions should be factual and non-discriminatory. Generic promotions for digital television would be encouraged,\" the ITC said. The ITC is also proposing to tighten guidelines on undue prominence for products within programmes. In addition, it is planning to review whether digital broadcasters with interactive services should supply a feed clear of the interactive icon to channels that cannot offer interactivity. An ITV spokesman said promotions and cross-promotions were an \"increasingly important way of informing viewers about programmes and services available in the multi-channel world\". \"However, broadcasters need to strike the right balance between informing viewers and protecting the quality of the viewing experience,\" he added. Advertisers warned that a relaxation of rules governing on-air trailers could \"reduce the impact of paid-for spot advertising\". \"Research suggests that increasing levels of cross-promotion may often be perceived by viewers as increasing levels of spot advertising,\" the Incorporated Society of British Advertisers said.

      "body": "<p>Marc Rich was pardoned in January by the outgoing President Bill Clinton in an act which provoked puzzlement and anger.</p> <p>In Washington, the House of Representatives committee on government reform is investigating whether the pardon had anything to do with the fact that Mr Rich's ex-wife Denise, a New York socialite, had given $450,000 (\u00a3314,000) to the Clinton Library and $1.2m in donations to Democratic party campaigns, including Hillary Clinton's bid for the Senate.</p> <p>Dan Burton, the committee's Republican chairman, said: \"Mr Rich was publicly reported to have traded with just about every enemy the US has had over the last 20 years.\"</p> <p>Mr Rich's 18-year battle with the US authorities became public knowledge in October 1982, when the existence of a grand jury investigation into his tax affairs was leaked. The allegation was that he was involved in a \"classic criminal fraud\" - a view the justice department still holds.</p> <p>By summer 1983 the net was closing in and Mr Rich fled to Switzerland. In September, the grand jury handed down a 51-count indictment against him and his main business partner, Pincus Green, of wire fraud, racketeering, trading with the enemy during the 1980 Iranian hostage crisis, and tax evasion.</p> <p>It charged them with violating federal controls on oil prices through a complex daisy chain of transactions. Profits from a $100m income were moved off-shore, evading $48m in taxes. If convicted on all counts, Mr Rich faced up to 300 years in prison.</p> <p>It has been suggested that he also supplied weapons and spare parts to the Iranian regime of Ayatollah Khomeini. Hours before his pardon, an FBI criminal background check was sent to the White House indicating that he was involved in \"arms dealing\".</p> <p>After lengthy negotiations, his US companies pleaded guilty in 1984 to tax evasion and making false statements, and paid fines of $200m.</p> <p>With a $750,000 price on his head, Mr Rich was said to travel with an armed escort of former Israeli soldiers.

      "bodyText": "Marc Rich was pardoned in January by the outgoing President Bill Clinton in an act which provoked puzzlement and anger. In Washington, the House of Representatives committee on government reform is investigating whether the pardon had anything to do with the fact that Mr Rich's ex-wife Denise, a New York socialite, had given $450,000 (\u00a3314,000) to the Clinton Library and $1.2m in donations to Democratic party campaigns, including Hillary Clinton's bid for the Senate. Dan Burton, the committee's Republican chairman, said: \"Mr Rich was publicly reported to have traded with just about every enemy the US has had over the last 20 years.\" Mr Rich's 18-year battle with the US authorities became public knowledge in October 1982, when the existence of a grand jury investigation into his tax affairs was leaked. The allegation was that he was involved in a \"classic criminal fraud\" - a view the justice department still holds. By summer 1983 the net was closing in and Mr Rich fled to Switzerland. In September, the grand jury handed down a 51-count indictment against him and his main business partner, Pincus Green, of wire fraud, racketeering, trading with the enemy during the 1980 Iranian hostage crisis, and tax evasion. It charged them with violating federal controls on oil prices through a complex daisy chain of transactions. Profits from a $100m income were moved off-shore, evading $48m in taxes. If convicted on all counts, Mr Rich faced up to 300 years in prison. It has been suggested that he also supplied weapons and spare parts to the Iranian regime of Ayatollah Khomeini. Hours before his pardon, an FBI criminal background check was sent to the White House indicating that he was involved in \"arms dealing\". After lengthy negotiations, his US companies pleaded guilty in 1984 to tax evasion and making false statements, and paid fines of $200m. With a $750,000 price on his head, Mr Rich was said to travel with an armed escort of former Israeli soldiers. Yet he was nearly captured by accident in July 1986 in an anti-terrorist clampdown at Heathrow airport. Having flown into Britain on a Swissair flight, he panicked when he spotted the tightened security as he walked towards the departure gate to return to Zurich. Afraid of arousing suspicions, he abandoned three cheques totalling $1.6m in the pages of a phone directory at a public telephone booth. His luck held shortly afterwards when, with police waiting for his private Gulfstream jet after a tip-off, a pea-soup of a fog covered Biggin Hill airfield, Kent, and the flight returned to Switzerland. Now 66 and pondering whether to return to the US and face civil proceedings, he has made another lucrative killing by selling his trading arm, Marc Rich Investment, to a Russian conglomerate for $100m. ABC news in America reported this week that US authorities had seized the \u00a33.6m bank account he is using to pay his legal team. New York state has filed a tax warrant, claiming that he owes \u00a319m in state and personal income taxes, and \u00a380m in penalties and interest.

Indeed, it was a difficult business boiling all the candidates down to a mere 40. There is no significance to their order. I selected them as I munched my way through dozens, no hundreds, of retrospective breakfasts, lunches and dinners, and sometimes odd meals in between. The cheering thing is the knowledge that there are many, many more establishments of equal character and quality out there. Now, if you'll excuse me: \"Waiter!\"",

      "body": "<p><strong> 1 Adam and Eve, Bishopsgate, Norwich, NR3 1RZ Tel: 01603 667423</strong> </p> <p>Golden oldie, as it were, and feels like it, what with settles, panels, tiles and a snug. Parts date back to 1249. No matter, the business within is a bit more up to date. They even welcome kids. Class Adnams, Greene King IPA and Theakston's OP on the pumps (plus guest beers), Addlestone's cider and proper wines. And the food? I thought you'd never ask. Everything from chunky soups (cheese and ale with pastry thatching) to weighty puds (spicy bread and butter) by way of substantial main/single dishes (sausage casserole). For quick biters, however, there are sandwiches, baps and French breads filled with all manner of goodies. </p> <p> <strong> 2 The Angel Inn, Hetton, North Yorks, BD23 6LT Tel: 01756 730263</strong> </p> <p>An institution in every sense of the word (the inn is 400 years old) except in spirit - it is in no way fossilised. Top notch, lively cooking in modern European idiom (tomato tart, roast loin of lamb with sun-dried tomatoes, grilled squid salad) from a talented kitchen. There is a tremendous wine list, with plenty of seriously classy numbers available by the glass. There is also a selection of good beers while the service has similar attention to detail. The place generates a rollicking, confident style. Rolling dales around you to work up an appetite. Bar snacks, bar meals, or the full restaurant monty. What more could you want? </p> <p> <strong> 3 Bar Moosh, 1-3 Station Road, Cambridge, CB1 2JB Tel: 01223 360268</strong> </p> <p>Moosh is in a little run of eateries close to the station. Large and cheerfully ramshackle, it throbs with world music. A long list of cocktails are in the \u00a34-\u00a35 range. Fashionable mass-market beers on tap, Courage Directors on the hand pump and a wine list that is more than a gesture. Serious cheeses signal gastro-intent. There's substantial grub too: brioches stuffed with cheese or wild mushrooms; fresh mussels with parsley, garlic and chilli or ginger coriander and saffron; big salads. And spotted dick and treacle roly poly with custard among the puds. </p> <p> <strong> 4 Cedar Farm Cafe, Back Lane, Mawdesley, Lancashire, L40 3SY Tel: 01704 823396</strong> </p> <p>Cedar Farm is a working pig farm with craft workshops and studios, a gallery, clothes shop, aroma room, deli, and espresso bar. The cafe, which is also licensed, has been open for 10 years, and is renowned for its soup. This comes in starter-sized portions with flavours such as celeriac and cider or butternut squash with lime and ginger, and main-course sizes, which are deliciously gloopier. There are pasta dishes, bagels and wraps available too, and nothing costs more than \u00a35.50. Puddings are hearty and toe-warming, of the poached plums and bread-and- butter pudding variety. </p> <p> <strong> 5 Harts, Standard Court, Park Row, Nottingham, NJ1 6GN Tel: 0115-911 0666</strong> </p> <p>Tasty and tasteful. As smart as anything in London and elegant with it. Staff are clued up and well trained and Mark Gough's cooking is spot-on and stylish. Graduate of Raymond Blanc academy, so the food is light but not slight, with distinct flavours and plenty of them. Prices range from \u00a39.90 for two courses and \u00a313.40 for three at lunchtime. There is a sample menu of mushroom soup or Italian salad, followed by Hart's fish cakes or roast pork filled with rosti potatoes and caramelised apples. This is rounded off by chocolate marquise or fromage frais with strawberry juice. Decent wines available by the glass. </p> <p> <strong> 6 The Kitchen Bar, 16-18 Victoria Square, Belfast, BT1 4QA Tel: 028-9032 4901</strong> </p> <p>The unique, splendid realm of Pat Catney, and other members of the Catney clan. One of the finest eateries and drinkeries of its kind in the world. Not exactly a gastro-pub, but the Ulster fry (distinguishing feature , three kinds of fried bread: potato bread, soda bread, and farls, all made by Mother Catney) is an Everest among breakfasts, not least because of superb sausages and bacon. Other notables include Paddy's pizza (a slab of soda bread with a slice of boiled gammon, Coleraine cheddar and tomatoes; eggs optional) and Irish stew with beef. Excellent stouts plus a real ale. </p> <p> <strong> 7 Ming, 35-36 Greek Street, London W1 Tel: 020-77734 2721</strong> </p> <p>There is a calm, elegant, soothing and well-mannered atmosphere compared with the more in-your-face style and service you get round the corner in Gerrard Street and Lisle Street. The food is as good as you'll get in any of the usual favourites in the area, however, and better than most. You can spend more than \u00a315 a head on Tibetan garlic lamb, double-braised pork hot-pot and peppered salmon, but it does a high-value lunch at \u00a310 that includes Mr Edward's pork (a Chinese classic), Empress beef and aubergine in spiced salt. It is worth pointing out that the intelligent wine list is also intelligently priced. </p> <p> <strong> 8 The Patio Restaurant, 13 Swinegate Court East, York, YO1 8AJ Tel: 01904 627879</strong> </p> <p>A hidden gem in a rather too real sense: by the time you've actually located Patio you might actually have worked up a sufficient appetite. A bright, stripped-wood interior is the setting for a menu blending northern British and Mediterranean. More than acceptable starters include delectable pates and deep-fried Camembert (\u00a32.95 to \u00a34.95). The highlight of the main courses, at \u00a36.95, is the seasoned Cumberland bangers with onions, gravy and a memorable creamy mash. Also starring is loin of lamb stuffed with garlic in a redcurrant and rosemary sauce, at \u00a38.95. </p> <p> <strong> 9 Carmela's, 28 George Street, Nailsworth, Gloucestershire, GL6 OAG Tel: 01453 834802</strong> </p> <p>Nailsworth is something of a gourmet focal point, what with a top-class fishmongers and delicatessen, two decent butchers, an organic greengrocer and Carmela's. There are two Carmela's really, both warm and cosy: lunchtime Carmela's, which is a cheapskate classic; and the evening Carmela's, which is a bit fancier but doesn't quite skate in on price. But the cooking has the same vigour and colour and generous approach to portion control. There's a bit of the chicken liver pate and avocado and prawns variety (very superior versions, it has to be said), but inspiration comes from all over - meze, charcuterie, big gloopy salads, chicken stuffed with three cheeses and tarragon, mackerel with red onion marmalade, veggie options and top-of-the-range chips. Superior cooking and a tasty wine list. </p> <p> <strong> 10 Cellar Gascon, 59 West Smithfield, London EC1 Tel: 020-7600 7561</strong> </p> <p>Rather more laid-back than the parent Club Gascon next door. Very charming staff serve up a kind of Gascon mezze. Order any number of small dishes of charcuterie of all shapes and sizes, including cold andouillette and hams, duck and goose liver in various guises, and black pudding, as well as piperade and salt cod among the meat offerings. Breads are very healthy. As there is an inspiring wine list which explores the lesser known corners of French vins du pays, a seductive array of armagnacs and a decent line in cigars, you may be tempted to linger longer and spend more than the regulation \u00a315. </p> <p> <strong> 11 The Cooked Meat Shop, Bath Market, Bath, BA2 4AW Tel: 01225 425 640</strong> </p> <p>Bath chaps, pigs' tails, chitterlings, brawn, hazlet, The Cooked Meat Shop is a tiny museum of Britain's lost charcuterie heritage. It's not much to look at, but never mind the presentation, taste the quality. Of course, there's stuff to pick up and take home, such as serious steak and kidney pies, but there's also stuff to eat on the hoof. There's a big range of pasties: Jamaican (99p), Cornish (99p) and spinach and feta (\u00a31.09) for the vegetarian. There are jumbo sausage rolls and handy-sized pork pies (49p). While you're at it, explore the other delights of Bath Market and help keep a traditional food centre in business. </p> <p> <strong> 12 Exceed, 65 South Methven Street, Perth, PN1 5NX Tel: 01738-621189</strong> </p> <p>Exceed has been open just over a year, and it, er, exceeds, expectations. Top-notch local materials sourced with attention to detail and cooked with respect and skill. The menu is as substantial as the helpings. There are salmon rillettes with avocado relish, duck confit with pecorino garlic mash and rocket oil, smoked haddock chowder, mushroom risotto cakes, pork with mozzarella crumble and gazpacho sauce and chicken with roast apple. </p> <p> <strong> 13 Eyre Bros, 35 Charlotte Road, London, EC2 Tel: 020-7739 5345</strong> </p> <p>Brought to you by David Eyre, ex-chef of the legendary gastro-pub, The Eagle, this tiny sandwich bar on one of Shoreditch's most fashionable streets starts out with plenty of credibility. Top-notch lunch fodder with hefty sandwiches (rare beef and fresh horseradish, pork loin, and so on, on crusty home-baked bread, all at \u00a34), fresh soups and salads (\u00a33) and Med-inspired bigger dishes for \u00a36-\u00a37. The staff are decked out in chef's whites to add that extra dash of professionalism and class, helped along by the well-thumbed collection of cookbooks stacked behind the counter. A quick bite out of necessity; its four stools don't make for a leisurely lunch. </p> <p> <strong> 14 Fryer's Delight, 19 Theobald Road, London, WC1 Tel: 020-7405 4114</strong> </p> <p>This is the real thing. The smell of hot beef-dripping tells the full story. Beef dripping is the original and finest frying medium for fish and chips. It seems to bring out an inherent sweetness in potatoes and adds a warm gloss of turf to the poor man's surf. First-class fresh fish with a generous sense of portion control, chips like railway sleepers, serious pickled gherkins, leatherette banquette seats, formica-topped tables, steamed-up windows, service as brisk and unsentimental as you like. The classic chippie. </p> <p> <strong> 15 The Gallery, 256 Brixton Hill, London, SW2 Tel: 0208-671 8311</strong> </p> <p>A Portguese stunner serving some of the heftiest, heartiest, most mouth-filling, rib-sticking food in London. You (and at least two others) could eat yourself to a standstill for \u00a327.50 on cataplana (a kind of sealed pot that looks like a metal ball) of salt cod with clams and prawns in the restaurant at the back with its idiosyncratic decor. Or you can take away a bit of chicken, ribs or lamb grilled over the flames and doused in peri-peri or jedungo sauce for under a fiver. It's your call. </p> <p> <strong> 16 The Gallery Restaurant and Millsy's Cafe Bar, 20 Earlsdon Street, Coventry, CV5, 6EG Tel: 0247-671 3222</strong> </p> <p>This former newsagent's in the prosperous suburb of Earlsdon is a classy joint where it's just possible to tuck away a two-course dinner for \u00a315, including Cajun spiced fishcakes, avocado salsa and cucumber relish; mille feuille of aubergine, red pepper and forest mushrooms with a garlic and herb cream sauce, at \u00a34.95 each. For dyed-in-the-wool guzzlers there are the light lunchtime meals in the cafe-bar downstairs. Choices range from bangers and mash with onion gravy to bruschetta with caramelised smoked haddock, Delicious house wines are from \u00a38.95 a bottle. </p> <p> <strong> 17 The George &amp; Dragon, High Street, Rowde, Wiltshire, SN10 2PN Tel: 01380 723053</strong> </p> <p>One of the first, one of the best gastro-pubs. Both pub and gastro bits are happily balanced. Small, crepuscular, warm and wooden just beyond Devizes in lovely, leafy Wiltshire. No fancy trimmings. Food out of the top drawer by Tim Withers. Fish a major item, and fresh enough to show up many a pricier gaff. Handled with real flair. Classics and contemporary European dishes good enough for a celebratory number, or simply to fill up at lunch. Bona puddings. Brilliant beer and proper wines. </p> <p> <strong> 18 Harry Ramsden's, White Cross, Guiseley, Leeds, LS20 8LZ Tel: 01943 874641</strong> </p> <p>You can find them everywhere now, from Inverness to Jeddah, not to mention at the odd airport and motorway service station. But the original should be a mecca for every serious lover of cod in batter with chips. Chips come included in the price these days, and cod, well that's \u00a35.50 for a fillet and \u00a37.65 for a special. But cod is a luxury item now, don't you know. Still the best British street food, especially when fried in beef dripping, doused in vinegar and topped with mushy peas. </p> <p> <strong> 19 Ichiban Noodle Cafe, 50 Queen Street, Glasgow, G1 3EN Tel: 0141-204 4200</strong> </p> <p>Noodles - cheap, cheerful, copious and child-friendly. Ichiban doles out oodles of noodles to a constant stream of eager eaters aged from six months to 66 years with ease and calm. It doesn't just do those huge steaming bowls of soba, ramen and udon noodles swimming in broth. If you're up for something a bit more recherch\u00e9, try the 11 variations on a sushi theme, from omelette to octopus, or bento boxes of sushi, dumplings and tempura, and miso soup. Organic wine, Kirin and Asahi beers, and sencha tea for non-boozers. Lunch/dinner \u00a35.50. </p> <p> <strong> 20 Jamfish, 28-32 Greenwood Street, Altrincham, Cheshire, WA14 1RZ Tel: 0161-928 6677.</strong> </p> <p>The open-plan kitchen delivers dainties through to full meals (\u00a32.95-\u00a311.95), from salads and sandwiches to dishes with style and substance. Try lamb carpaccio with Swiss chard; smoked haddock and oyster mushroom risotto; or calves liver and kidney with pancetta. A North African edge catches the eye: look out for Tunisian fish soup with harissa butter and tabouna bread and Moroccan tagine with dried figs and preserved lemons. Kids' menu includes sweetcorn and feta cheese, omelette with sauteed potatoes. Conveniently split into bar, lounge and restaurant areas. </p> <p> <strong> 21 Kambi's, 107 Western Road, Brighton, BN1 2AA. Tel: 01273 327934</strong> </p> <p>It's hard to love Western Road but it does, however, boast Kambi's, a Lebanese BYOB restaurant with a takeaway counter to satisfy the quickest and pickiest of quick biters. Starters include arayess (minced lamb with parsley, grilled in Lebanese bread and marinated in olive oil) and sawdadajaj (fried chicken liver with lemon). Veggies should go straight for the specialist main courses for makdous bitinjan (baby aubergine stuffed with walnuts, spices, garlic and marinated in olive oil), tabbouleh, hummus, kabis (Lebanese pickles) and warakinab (stuffed vine leaves). All at under \u00a33 a shot. Chargrilling is a speciality, but only, natch, for meaties. </p> <p> <strong> 22 Lettonie, 35 Kelston Road, Bath, Somerset, BA1 3QH Tel: 01225 446676</strong> </p> <p>There are no lengths to which the Guzzler will not go in search of a bargain, even if it means taking in a double Michelin-starred restaurant. But as Lettonie is prepared to show such daring - a two-course autumn menu for \u00a315 (although, with extras, that could swell) - then so must we. Housed in a Georgian pile, it has a proper (without being stuffy) dining room, with proper waiting staff and a proper complement of appetisers and extras. A \"fish and chips\" starter came with pert plaice chunks and impossibly thin crisped potato, and an impeccable tartare sauce. </p> <p> <strong> 23 Mandola, 139-141 Westbourne Grove, London, W11 Tel: 020-7229 4734</strong> </p> <p>Every neighbourhood should have a Sudanese restaurant, as the food is much more interesting and varied than some other highly touted national nosh. It sort of sits happily between the lightness and spice of North Africa and the greater heft of Ottoman and Turkish food, what with salata aswad (a splendid aubergine goo), salata daqua (a salad of white cabbage in peanut sauce), chicken halla in a potent tomato sauce, and date mousse. The interior bounces with colour, toned down by subtle lighting at night. Service can be seductively languid. Very popular. Booking essential. </p> <p> <strong> 24 Markwick's, 43 Corn Street, Bristol, Avon Tel: 0117 926 2658</strong> </p> <p>Ever wanted to break into a bank vault? It's a rather elegant experience, and you eat pretty damn well into the bargain if you make it to Markwick's (previous incarnation: bank vault). Stephen Markwick has been doling out the helpings for any number of years, and very good helpings they are too: guinea fowl with lentils and Savoy cabbage, salmon in pastry with currants and ginger. Many organic ingredients. Sadly, only lunch (\u00a314.50) just scrapes in, but it's worth spending much more. </p> <p> <strong> 25 Mims, 63 East Barnet Road, Barnet, Herts, EN4 8RN Tel: 020-8449 2974</strong> </p> <p>Mims is an oddity, and no mistake. It stands in a row of shops, quietly minding its own business and going about its own business with charm and determination. One of the best-value meals in the country, not because it is cheap (although it limbos comfortably under the \u00a315-a-head criteria; it charges \u00a310.50 for a two-course lunch, and \u00a314 for a two-course dinner) but because the food is serious, classy, generous and definitely tasty. The cooking stands firmly in the European mainstream, with impeccably fresh ingredients blended deftly and distinctively. </p> <p> <strong> 26 The Narrows, 8-10 Shore Road, Portaferry, County Down, BT22 Tel: 028-4272 8148</strong> </p> <p>Three years ago, the Narrows restaurant shouldered its way into the sleepy coastal village of Portaferry, banged all its saucepans and loudly declared itself the best place to eat in the county. And at the prices chef Danny Millar charges, it's difficult to argue. The late 70s rustic-French-canteen-effect dining room is horrible, but the food - locally caught seafood, Mourne lamb - beats the decor into submission. Cheapskaters are advised to go for the Lunch Bowl Special (\u00a35.95), which could be cod and chips one day, chicken with basil mash the next and who knows what tomorrow. </p> <p> <strong> 27 Patio, 5 Goldhawk Road, London W12 Tel: 020-8743 5194</strong> </p> <p>One of London's great restaurants, although you could walk past it a dozen times and not see it. Three courses are \u00a39.90 including vodka and an unmatched warmth of welcome, charm of service, and sense of the pleasure of life. The borscht is one of the most sublime soups you will ever eat. The pierogi (little ravioli) are exemplary. And the puds, as Mr Charles Campion put it, are \"high octane\". Rather like the vodka. </p> <p> <strong> 28 Pot of Beer, 36 New Mount Street, Manchester, M4 4DE Tel 0161-834 8579</strong> </p> <p>Not all is as it seems. Tucked away on a back street just beyond the fringes of the city centre, towards the Boddingtons brewery and within sight of Strangeways, this apparently typical Manchester pub disguises a kitchen brimful of Polish goodies. Under the watchful eye of the Polish White Eagle, real ales rub shoulders with Zywiec beer and a selection of vodkas. Pass on the sandwiches, jacket potatoes and chips. Go straight to mouth-filling, heart-warming borscht (beetroot soup), sledzie (pickled herrings), bigos (pork and sauerkraut), kielbasa (grilled sausage), wedliny (cooked meats), placki (fried potato cakes), flaki (tripe), golabki (stuffed cabbage) and pierogi (large ravioli stuffed with cheese or meat), all for less than \u00a35. Place your order by phone. </p> <p> <strong> 29 The Riverside Inn, Aymestrey, Herefordshire, HR6 9ST Tel: 01568 708440</strong> </p> <p>Escape from high-profile gastro-capital Ludlow just down the road to where the River Lugg gurgles, popping with trout, fringed with bluebells and wild garlic in season. Real fires burn in real grates and real food is served with real beer from the nearby Woodhampton Brewery. Much local produce on show, lamb, beef and cheeses included, and vegetables, salads and herbs are homegrown. Cooking changes according to season and is rooted in European classics, for example seafood risotto, squid in red wine, venison with stuffed cabbage and Hereford rump with scoundrel's sauce. </p> <p> <strong> 30 Sausage &amp; Mash Cafe, 268 Portobello Road, London W10 Tel: 020-8968 8898</strong> </p> <p>All the world loves a sausage. The S&amp;M does them in style - comfort food for the day before, the morning after, and right now this minute. There's a gallery of about eight broad-shouldered bangers including a decent veggie option, plus six kinds of mash and five gravies. Presentation is a high art form - dishes (troughs) arrive with everything together - a mountain of creamy, monster mash with sausages jammed in at angles and gravy everywhere. It is a bit of a canteen - benches, smoke and noise. Not a trace of subtlety or sophistication. Great for groups or losing yourself in a crowd. Wine if you want or need it. </p> <p> <strong> 31 St John, 26 St John Street, London EC1 Tel: 020-7251 0848</strong> </p> <p>All right, I know St John is a pukka restaurant, shortlisted for top honours in the Mo\u00ebt et Chandon London restaurant awards and all that. But people forget that it does admirable Guzzler-priced bar meals - lamb and green sauce sandwich, brawn, trotter and mash, Welsh rarebit, dripping toast, cold duck breast and pickled damsons, celeriac and boiled egg, Eccles cake and Lancashire cheese. There's more for the unreconstructed carnivore than the epicurean veggie, but it's all very good stuff, and is around the \u00a35-\u00a38 mark. Serious bread, brilliant beers, proper wines. Why can't more restaurants do something as intelligent? </p> <p> <strong> 32 Tampopo, Albert Square, Manchester, M2 5PF Tel: 0161-819 1966</strong> </p> <p>Manchester's first and finest noodle bar has gone from strength to strength in its short lifetime. This minimalist basement restaurant promotes a contemporary approach to dining with a flexible menu which is an extensive cruise around southeast Asia, calling at Japan, Thailand and Malaysia among others. The astute management encourages customers to turn up on spec, only taking bookings for parties of six, but they work this policy well so you never wait long. Tampopo also has aspirations for greater things, as its recent catering for a Texas after-show party at Manchester's DKNY store showed. </p> <p><strong> 33 Tas, 33 The Cut, London SE1 Tel: 020-7928 1444</strong> </p> <p>Winner of the Time Out vegetarian award this year, although it caters just as adequately for carnivores. A large, smart, light, bright place with open-plan grill and understandably busy. For Turkophiles, the cooking is Anatolian in origin. The large, a la carte menu covers everything from kirmizi mercimek corbeasi, or red lentil soup to you, to dil baligi, grilled Dover sole, by way of patlicanli, grilled aubergine with tomato and peppers, and bobrek izgara, grilled lamb kidney, oregano and cumin. Set menus from \u00a36.45 to \u00a317.95 (for two people) provides the easy way in. Flavours fresh, fearless and forthright. Cheerful service. Try one of the Turkish wines on the list. </p> <p><strong> 34 Valvona &amp; Crolla, 19 Elm Row, Edinburgh, EH7 4AA Tel: 0131-556 6066</strong> </p> <p>Why can't there be more places like this? Light, bright, open space at the back of the best food shop in Britain. Cheerful, capable service and, very importantly for some, terrifically child-friendly. Tremendous Italian wines by the glass. And some of the best Italian food anywhere. This is home cooking at its best. It may be pizza, pasta, antipasti, soups, salads and meaty or fishy dishes of the day but it is Italian home cooking based on first-class ingredients handled with true understanding and generosity. This place beats the pants off far fancier restaurants every time. Make sure you go early. It gets extremely busy. </p> <p><strong> 35 The Village Bakery, Melmerby, Cumbria, CA10 1HE Tel: 01768 881515</strong> </p> <p>It's an unlikely spot to find a top-notch bakery, teahouse, modest eatery. Behind it looms the long, smooth buttress of the north Pennines. Around it sprawls the village of Melmerby (with the bustling Shepherd's Arms dispensing Jennings beers and decent pub grub). The bakery is, however, the star turn. It has cracking bread, with French and Russian rye the specialities, cruiserweight pasties, indecently seductive florentines and other biscuity goodies if you have to dash. It's also in the market for breakfast, snacks, soups, sandwiches, light lunches, teas and a few more substantial dishes, all made according to strict organic principles. </p> <p> <strong> 36 Wee Curry Shop, 7 Buccleuch Street, Glasgow, G3 6SJ Tel: 0141-353 0777</strong> </p> <p>A little bit of back-street Calcutta or Bombay - tiny restaurant, rickety tables, functional oilskin tablecloths, with the odd choice touch of tartan curtains, halogen spots, and prints of Indian women in saris. The proximity of the open-plan kitchen means you watch your food being cooked before you eat - cookery demo and lunch rolled in to one. The basics are properly looked to - grade A rice, top-hole puris, ace parathas and keep room for karahis and chilli garlic chicken. Veggies are more variable. The bills are on a par with the space, and the food comes flying to the table. </p> <p> <strong> 37 Ruchi, 42 Stoke Newington Church Street, London N16 Tel: 020-7923 4564</strong> </p> <p>There's no shortage of Indian restaurants in N16, and some are seriously classy. Bright, new and very pink, Ruchi is firmly in the classy class despite being less than \u00a315 a head. The team graduated from nearby Rasa, specialising in southern India's seafood and vegetarian cuisine, so coconut, curry leaves and tamarind are much in evidence. Spicing is fresh and considerate, rather than searing. Pumpkin with sweet potato and spinach, squid stuffed with vegetables, coconut and herbs, and chembu curry, made with eddoes, all hit the spot. Outstanding breads and charmingly chummy service. Take away if you must. </p> <p> <strong> 38 Sushi-Hiro, 1 Station Parade, Uxbridge Road, London, W3 Tel: 020-8896 3175</strong> </p> <p>Oasis of civilised calm in hectic Ealing/Acton border country. Almost meditative tranquillity of light, bright, clean-cut, pine and white interior. Fresh sushi and sashimi jewel-like in carefully ordered selections. Fish bought daily from Billingsgate. Nigiri and chirashi options, and fancier stuff still a la carte.

      "bodyText": "1 Adam and Eve, Bishopsgate, Norwich, NR3 1RZ Tel: 01603 667423 Golden oldie, as it were, and feels like it, what with settles, panels, tiles and a snug. Parts date back to 1249. No matter, the business within is a bit more up to date. They even welcome kids. Class Adnams, Greene King IPA and Theakston's OP on the pumps (plus guest beers), Addlestone's cider and proper wines. And the food? I thought you'd never ask. Everything from chunky soups (cheese and ale with pastry thatching) to weighty puds (spicy bread and butter) by way of substantial main/single dishes (sausage casserole). For quick biters, however, there are sandwiches, baps and French breads filled with all manner of goodies. 2 The Angel Inn, Hetton, North Yorks, BD23 6LT Tel: 01756 730263 An institution in every sense of the word (the inn is 400 years old) except in spirit - it is in no way fossilised. Top notch, lively cooking in modern European idiom (tomato tart, roast loin of lamb with sun-dried tomatoes, grilled squid salad) from a talented kitchen. There is a tremendous wine list, with plenty of seriously classy numbers available by the glass. There is also a selection of good beers while the service has similar attention to detail. The place generates a rollicking, confident style. Rolling dales around you to work up an appetite. Bar snacks, bar meals, or the full restaurant monty. What more could you want? 3 Bar Moosh, 1-3 Station Road, Cambridge, CB1 2JB Tel: 01223 360268 Moosh is in a little run of eateries close to the station. Large and cheerfully ramshackle, it throbs with world music. A long list of cocktails are in the \u00a34-\u00a35 range. Fashionable mass-market beers on tap, Courage Directors on the hand pump and a wine list that is more than a gesture. Serious cheeses signal gastro-intent. There's substantial grub too: brioches stuffed with cheese or wild mushrooms; fresh mussels with parsley, garlic and chilli or ginger coriander and saffron; big salads. And spotted dick and treacle roly poly with custard among the puds. 4 Cedar Farm Cafe, Back Lane, Mawdesley, Lancashire, L40 3SY Tel: 01704 823396 Cedar Farm is a working pig farm with craft workshops and studios, a gallery, clothes shop, aroma room, deli, and espresso bar. The cafe, which is also licensed, has been open for 10 years, and is renowned for its soup. This comes in starter-sized portions with flavours such as celeriac and cider or butternut squash with lime and ginger, and main-course sizes, which are deliciously gloopier. There are pasta dishes, bagels and wraps available too, and nothing costs more than \u00a35.50. Puddings are hearty and toe-warming, of the poached plums and bread-and- butter pudding variety. 5 Harts, Standard Court, Park Row, Nottingham, NJ1 6GN Tel: 0115-911 0666 Tasty and tasteful. As smart as anything in London and elegant with it. Staff are clued up and well trained and Mark Gough's cooking is spot-on and stylish. Graduate of Raymond Blanc academy, so the food is light but not slight, with distinct flavours and plenty of them. Prices range from \u00a39.90 for two courses and \u00a313.40 for three at lunchtime. There is a sample menu of mushroom soup or Italian salad, followed by Hart's fish cakes or roast pork filled with rosti potatoes and caramelised apples. This is rounded off by chocolate marquise or fromage frais with strawberry juice. Decent wines available by the glass. 6 The Kitchen Bar, 16-18 Victoria Square, Belfast, BT1 4QA Tel: 028-9032 4901 The unique, splendid realm of Pat Catney, and other members of the Catney clan. One of the finest eateries and drinkeries of its kind in the world. Not exactly a gastro-pub, but the Ulster fry (distinguishing feature , three kinds of fried bread: potato bread, soda bread, and farls, all made by Mother Catney) is an Everest among breakfasts, not least because of superb sausages and bacon. Other notables include Paddy's pizza (a slab of soda bread with a slice of boiled gammon, Coleraine cheddar and tomatoes; eggs optional) and Irish stew with beef. Excellent stouts plus a real ale. 7 Ming, 35-36 Greek Street, London W1 Tel: 020-77734 2721 There is a calm, elegant, soothing and well-mannered atmosphere compared with the more in-your-face style and service you get round the corner in Gerrard Street and Lisle Street. The food is as good as you'll get in any of the usual favourites in the area, however, and better than most. You can spend more than \u00a315 a head on Tibetan garlic lamb, double-braised pork hot-pot and peppered salmon, but it does a high-value lunch at \u00a310 that includes Mr Edward's pork (a Chinese classic), Empress beef and aubergine in spiced salt. It is worth pointing out that the intelligent wine list is also intelligently priced. 8 The Patio Restaurant, 13 Swinegate Court East, York, YO1 8AJ Tel: 01904 627879 A hidden gem in a rather too real sense: by the time you've actually located Patio you might actually have worked up a sufficient appetite. A bright, stripped-wood interior is the setting for a menu blending northern British and Mediterranean. More than acceptable starters include delectable pates and deep-fried Camembert (\u00a32.95 to \u00a34.95). The highlight of the main courses, at \u00a36.95, is the seasoned Cumberland bangers with onions, gravy and a memorable creamy mash. Also starring is loin of lamb stuffed with garlic in a redcurrant and rosemary sauce, at \u00a38.95. 9 Carmela's, 28 George Street, Nailsworth, Gloucestershire, GL6 OAG Tel: 01453 834802 Nailsworth is something of a gourmet focal point, what with a top-class fishmongers and delicatessen, two decent butchers, an organic greengrocer and Carmela's. There are two Carmela's really, both warm and cosy: lunchtime Carmela's, which is a cheapskate classic; and the evening Carmela's, which is a bit fancier but doesn't quite skate in on price. But the cooking has the same vigour and colour and generous approach to portion control. There's a bit of the chicken liver pate and avocado and prawns variety (very superior versions, it has to be said), but inspiration comes from all over - meze, charcuterie, big gloopy salads, chicken stuffed with three cheeses and tarragon, mackerel with red onion marmalade, veggie options and top-of-the-range chips. Superior cooking and a tasty wine list. 10 Cellar Gascon, 59 West Smithfield, London EC1 Tel: 020-7600 7561 Rather more laid-back than the parent Club Gascon next door. Very charming staff serve up a kind of Gascon mezze. Order any number of small dishes of charcuterie of all shapes and sizes, including cold andouillette and hams, duck and goose liver in various guises, and black pudding, as well as piperade and salt cod among the meat offerings. Breads are very healthy. As there is an inspiring wine list which explores the lesser known corners of French vins du pays, a seductive array of armagnacs and a decent line in cigars, you may be tempted to linger longer and spend more than the regulation \u00a315. 11 The Cooked Meat Shop, Bath Market, Bath, BA2 4AW Tel: 01225 425 640 Bath chaps, pigs' tails, chitterlings, brawn, hazlet, The Cooked Meat Shop is a tiny museum of Britain's lost charcuterie heritage. It's not much to look at, but never mind the presentation, taste the quality. Of course, there's stuff to pick up and take home, such as serious steak and kidney pies, but there's also stuff to eat on the hoof. There's a big range of pasties: Jamaican (99p), Cornish (99p) and spinach and feta (\u00a31.09) for the vegetarian. There are jumbo sausage rolls and handy-sized pork pies (49p). While you're at it, explore the other delights of Bath Market and help keep a traditional food centre in business. 12 Exceed, 65 South Methven Street, Perth, PN1 5NX Tel: 01738-621189 Exceed has been open just over a year, and it, er, exceeds, expectations. Top-notch local materials sourced with attention to detail and cooked with respect and skill. The menu is as substantial as the helpings. There are salmon rillettes with avocado relish, duck confit with pecorino garlic mash and rocket oil, smoked haddock chowder, mushroom risotto cakes, pork with mozzarella crumble and gazpacho sauce and chicken with roast apple. 13 Eyre Bros, 35 Charlotte Road, London, EC2 Tel: 020-7739 5345 Brought to you by David Eyre, ex-chef of the legendary gastro-pub, The Eagle, this tiny sandwich bar on one of Shoreditch's most fashionable streets starts out with plenty of credibility. Top-notch lunch fodder with hefty sandwiches (rare beef and fresh horseradish, pork loin, and so on, on crusty home-baked bread, all at \u00a34), fresh soups and salads (\u00a33) and Med-inspired bigger dishes for \u00a36-\u00a37. The staff are decked out in chef's whites to add that extra dash of professionalism and class, helped along by the well-thumbed collection of cookbooks stacked behind the counter. A quick bite out of necessity; its four stools don't make for a leisurely lunch. 14 Fryer's Delight, 19 Theobald Road, London, WC1 Tel: 020-7405 4114 This is the real thing. The smell of hot beef-dripping tells the full story. Beef dripping is the original and finest frying medium for fish and chips. It seems to bring out an inherent sweetness in potatoes and adds a warm gloss of turf to the poor man's surf. First-class fresh fish with a generous sense of portion control, chips like railway sleepers, serious pickled gherkins, leatherette banquette seats, formica-topped tables, steamed-up windows, service as brisk and unsentimental as you like. The classic chippie. 15 The Gallery, 256 Brixton Hill, London, SW2 Tel: 0208-671 8311 A Portguese stunner serving some of the heftiest, heartiest, most mouth-filling, rib-sticking food in London. You (and at least two others) could eat yourself to a standstill for \u00a327.50 on cataplana (a kind of sealed pot that looks like a metal ball) of salt cod with clams and prawns in the restaurant at the back with its idiosyncratic decor. Or you can take away a bit of chicken, ribs or lamb grilled over the flames and doused in peri-peri or jedungo sauce for under a fiver. It's your call. 16 The Gallery Restaurant and Millsy's Cafe Bar, 20 Earlsdon Street, Coventry, CV5, 6EG Tel: 0247-671 3222 This former newsagent's in the prosperous suburb of Earlsdon is a classy joint where it's just possible to tuck away a two-course dinner for \u00a315, including Cajun spiced fishcakes, avocado salsa and cucumber relish; mille feuille of aubergine, red pepper and forest mushrooms with a garlic and herb cream sauce, at \u00a34.95 each. For dyed-in-the-wool guzzlers there are the light lunchtime meals in the cafe-bar downstairs. Choices range from bangers and mash with onion gravy to bruschetta with caramelised smoked haddock, Delicious house wines are from \u00a38.95 a bottle. 17 The George &amp; Dragon, High Street, Rowde, Wiltshire, SN10 2PN Tel: 01380 723053 One of the first, one of the best gastro-pubs. Both pub and gastro bits are happily balanced. Small, crepuscular, warm and wooden just beyond Devizes in lovely, leafy Wiltshire. No fancy trimmings. Food out of the top drawer by Tim Withers. Fish a major item, and fresh enough to show up many a pricier gaff. Handled with real flair. Classics and contemporary European dishes good enough for a celebratory number, or simply to fill up at lunch. Bona puddings. Brilliant beer and proper wines. 18 Harry Ramsden's, White Cross, Guiseley, Leeds, LS20 8LZ Tel: 01943 874641 You can find them everywhere now, from Inverness to Jeddah, not to mention at the odd airport and motorway service station. But the original should be a mecca for every serious lover of cod in batter with chips. Chips come included in the price these days, and cod, well that's \u00a35.50 for a fillet and \u00a37.65 for a special. But cod is a luxury item now, don't you know. Still the best British street food, especially when fried in beef dripping, doused in vinegar and topped with mushy peas. 19 Ichiban Noodle Cafe, 50 Queen Street, Glasgow, G1 3EN Tel: 0141-204 4200 Noodles - cheap, cheerful, copious and child-friendly. Ichiban doles out oodles of noodles to a constant stream of eager eaters aged from six months to 66 years with ease and calm. It doesn't just do those huge steaming bowls of soba, ramen and udon noodles swimming in broth. If you're up for something a bit more recherch\u00e9, try the 11 variations on a sushi theme, from omelette to octopus, or bento boxes of sushi, dumplings and tempura, and miso soup. Organic wine, Kirin and Asahi beers, and sencha tea for non-boozers. Lunch/dinner \u00a35.50. 20 Jamfish, 28-32 Greenwood Street, Altrincham, Cheshire, WA14 1RZ Tel: 0161-928 6677. The open-plan kitchen delivers dainties through to full meals (\u00a32.95-\u00a311.95), from salads and sandwiches to dishes with style and substance. Try lamb carpaccio with Swiss chard; smoked haddock and oyster mushroom risotto; or calves liver and kidney with pancetta. A North African edge catches the eye: look out for Tunisian fish soup with harissa butter and tabouna bread and Moroccan tagine with dried figs and preserved lemons. Kids' menu includes sweetcorn and feta cheese, omelette with sauteed potatoes. Conveniently split into bar, lounge and restaurant areas. 21 Kambi's, 107 Western Road, Brighton, BN1 2AA. Tel: 01273 327934 It's hard to love Western Road but it does, however, boast Kambi's, a Lebanese BYOB restaurant with a takeaway counter to satisfy the quickest and pickiest of quick biters. Starters include arayess (minced lamb with parsley, grilled in Lebanese bread and marinated in olive oil) and sawdadajaj (fried chicken liver with lemon). Veggies should go straight for the specialist main courses for makdous bitinjan (baby aubergine stuffed with walnuts, spices, garlic and marinated in olive oil), tabbouleh, hummus, kabis (Lebanese pickles) and warakinab (stuffed vine leaves). All at under \u00a33 a shot. Chargrilling is a speciality, but only, natch, for meaties. 22 Lettonie, 35 Kelston Road, Bath, Somerset, BA1 3QH Tel: 01225 446676 There are no lengths to which the Guzzler will not go in search of a bargain, even if it means taking in a double Michelin-starred restaurant. But as Lettonie is prepared to show such daring - a two-course autumn menu for \u00a315 (although, with extras, that could swell) - then so must we. Housed in a Georgian pile, it has a proper (without being stuffy) dining room, with proper waiting staff and a proper complement of appetisers and extras. A \"fish and chips\" starter came with pert plaice chunks and impossibly thin crisped potato, and an impeccable tartare sauce. 23 Mandola, 139-141 Westbourne Grove, London, W11 Tel: 020-7229 4734 Every neighbourhood should have a Sudanese restaurant, as the food is much more interesting and varied than some other highly touted national nosh. It sort of sits happily between the lightness and spice of North Africa and the greater heft of Ottoman and Turkish food, what with salata aswad (a splendid aubergine goo), salata daqua (a salad of white cabbage in peanut sauce), chicken halla in a potent tomato sauce, and date mousse. The interior bounces with colour, toned down by subtle lighting at night. Service can be seductively languid. Very popular. Booking essential. 24 Markwick's, 43 Corn Street, Bristol, Avon Tel: 0117 926 2658 Ever wanted to break into a bank vault? It's a rather elegant experience, and you eat pretty damn well into the bargain if you make it to Markwick's (previous incarnation: bank vault). Stephen Markwick has been doling out the helpings for any number of years, and very good helpings they are too: guinea fowl with lentils and Savoy cabbage, salmon in pastry with currants and ginger. Many organic ingredients. Sadly, only lunch (\u00a314.50) just scrapes in, but it's worth spending much more. 25 Mims, 63 East Barnet Road, Barnet, Herts, EN4 8RN Tel: 020-8449 2974 Mims is an oddity, and no mistake. It stands in a row of shops, quietly minding its own business and going about its own business with charm and determination. One of the best-value meals in the country, not because it is cheap (although it limbos comfortably under the \u00a315-a-head criteria; it charges \u00a310.50 for a two-course lunch, and \u00a314 for a two-course dinner) but because the food is serious, classy, generous and definitely tasty. The cooking stands firmly in the European mainstream, with impeccably fresh ingredients blended deftly and distinctively. 26 The Narrows, 8-10 Shore Road, Portaferry, County Down, BT22 Tel: 028-4272 8148 Three years ago, the Narrows restaurant shouldered its way into the sleepy coastal village of Portaferry, banged all its saucepans and loudly declared itself the best place to eat in the county. And at the prices chef Danny Millar charges, it's difficult to argue. The late 70s rustic-French-canteen-effect dining room is horrible, but the food - locally caught seafood, Mourne lamb - beats the decor into submission. Cheapskaters are advised to go for the Lunch Bowl Special (\u00a35.95), which could be cod and chips one day, chicken with basil mash the next and who knows what tomorrow. 27 Patio, 5 Goldhawk Road, London W12 Tel: 020-8743 5194 One of London's great restaurants, although you could walk past it a dozen times and not see it. Three courses are \u00a39.90 including vodka and an unmatched warmth of welcome, charm of service, and sense of the pleasure of life. The borscht is one of the most sublime soups you will ever eat. The pierogi (little ravioli) are exemplary. And the puds, as Mr Charles Campion put it, are \"high octane\". Rather like the vodka. 28 Pot of Beer, 36 New Mount Street, Manchester, M4 4DE Tel 0161-834 8579 Not all is as it seems. Tucked away on a back street just beyond the fringes of the city centre, towards the Boddingtons brewery and within sight of Strangeways, this apparently typical Manchester pub disguises a kitchen brimful of Polish goodies. Under the watchful eye of the Polish White Eagle, real ales rub shoulders with Zywiec beer and a selection of vodkas. Pass on the sandwiches, jacket potatoes and chips. Go straight to mouth-filling, heart-warming borscht (beetroot soup), sledzie (pickled herrings), bigos (pork and sauerkraut), kielbasa (grilled sausage), wedliny (cooked meats), placki (fried potato cakes), flaki (tripe), golabki (stuffed cabbage) and pierogi (large ravioli stuffed with cheese or meat), all for less than \u00a35. Place your order by phone. 29 The Riverside Inn, Aymestrey, Herefordshire, HR6 9ST Tel: 01568 708440 Escape from high-profile gastro-capital Ludlow just down the road to where the River Lugg gurgles, popping with trout, fringed with bluebells and wild garlic in season. Real fires burn in real grates and real food is served with real beer from the nearby Woodhampton Brewery. Much local produce on show, lamb, beef and cheeses included, and vegetables, salads and herbs are homegrown. Cooking changes according to season and is rooted in European classics, for example seafood risotto, squid in red wine, venison with stuffed cabbage and Hereford rump with scoundrel's sauce. 30 Sausage &amp; Mash Cafe, 268 Portobello Road, London W10 Tel: 020-8968 8898 All the world loves a sausage. The S&amp;M does them in style - comfort food for the day before, the morning after, and right now this minute. There's a gallery of about eight broad-shouldered bangers including a decent veggie option, plus six kinds of mash and five gravies. Presentation is a high art form - dishes (troughs) arrive with everything together - a mountain of creamy, monster mash with sausages jammed in at angles and gravy everywhere. It is a bit of a canteen - benches, smoke and noise. Not a trace of subtlety or sophistication. Great for groups or losing yourself in a crowd. Wine if you want or need it. 31 St John, 26 St John Street, London EC1 Tel: 020-7251 0848 All right, I know St John is a pukka restaurant, shortlisted for top honours in the Mo\u00ebt et Chandon London restaurant awards and all that. But people forget that it does admirable Guzzler-priced bar meals - lamb and green sauce sandwich, brawn, trotter and mash, Welsh rarebit, dripping toast, cold duck breast and pickled damsons, celeriac and boiled egg, Eccles cake and Lancashire cheese. There's more for the unreconstructed carnivore than the epicurean veggie, but it's all very good stuff, and is around the \u00a35-\u00a38 mark. Serious bread, brilliant beers, proper wines. Why can't more restaurants do something as intelligent? 32 Tampopo, Albert Square, Manchester, M2 5PF Tel: 0161-819 1966 Manchester's first and finest noodle bar has gone from strength to strength in its short lifetime. This minimalist basement restaurant promotes a contemporary approach to dining with a flexible menu which is an extensive cruise around southeast Asia, calling at Japan, Thailand and Malaysia among others. The astute management encourages customers to turn up on spec, only taking bookings for parties of six, but they work this policy well so you never wait long. Tampopo also has aspirations for greater things, as its recent catering for a Texas after-show party at Manchester's DKNY store showed. 33 Tas, 33 The Cut, London SE1 Tel: 020-7928 1444 Winner of the Time Out vegetarian award this year, although it caters just as adequately for carnivores. A large, smart, light, bright place with open-plan grill and understandably busy. For Turkophiles, the cooking is Anatolian in origin. The large, a la carte menu covers everything from kirmizi mercimek corbeasi, or red lentil soup to you, to dil baligi, grilled Dover sole, by way of patlicanli, grilled aubergine with tomato and peppers, and bobrek izgara, grilled lamb kidney, oregano and cumin. Set menus from \u00a36.45 to \u00a317.95 (for two people) provides the easy way in. Flavours fresh, fearless and forthright. Cheerful service. Try one of the Turkish wines on the list. 34 Valvona &amp; Crolla, 19 Elm Row, Edinburgh, EH7 4AA Tel: 0131-556 6066 Why can't there be more places like this? Light, bright, open space at the back of the best food shop in Britain. Cheerful, capable service and, very importantly for some, terrifically child-friendly. Tremendous Italian wines by the glass. And some of the best Italian food anywhere. This is home cooking at its best. It may be pizza, pasta, antipasti, soups, salads and meaty or fishy dishes of the day but it is Italian home cooking based on first-class ingredients handled with true understanding and generosity. This place beats the pants off far fancier restaurants every time. Make sure you go early. It gets extremely busy. 35 The Village Bakery, Melmerby, Cumbria, CA10 1HE Tel: 01768 881515 It's an unlikely spot to find a top-notch bakery, teahouse, modest eatery. Behind it looms the long, smooth buttress of the north Pennines. Around it sprawls the village of Melmerby (with the bustling Shepherd's Arms dispensing Jennings beers and decent pub grub). The bakery is, however, the star turn. It has cracking bread, with French and Russian rye the specialities, cruiserweight pasties, indecently seductive florentines and other biscuity goodies if you have to dash. It's also in the market for breakfast, snacks, soups, sandwiches, light lunches, teas and a few more substantial dishes, all made according to strict organic principles. 36 Wee Curry Shop, 7 Buccleuch Street, Glasgow, G3 6SJ Tel: 0141-353 0777 A little bit of back-street Calcutta or Bombay - tiny restaurant, rickety tables, functional oilskin tablecloths, with the odd choice touch of tartan curtains, halogen spots, and prints of Indian women in saris. The proximity of the open-plan kitchen means you watch your food being cooked before you eat - cookery demo and lunch rolled in to one. The basics are properly looked to - grade A rice, top-hole puris, ace parathas and keep room for karahis and chilli garlic chicken. Veggies are more variable. The bills are on a par with the space, and the food comes flying to the table. 37 Ruchi, 42 Stoke Newington Church Street, London N16 Tel: 020-7923 4564 There's no shortage of Indian restaurants in N16, and some are seriously classy. Bright, new and very pink, Ruchi is firmly in the classy class despite being less than \u00a315 a head. The team graduated from nearby Rasa, specialising in southern India's seafood and vegetarian cuisine, so coconut, curry leaves and tamarind are much in evidence. Spicing is fresh and considerate, rather than searing. Pumpkin with sweet potato and spinach, squid stuffed with vegetables, coconut and herbs, and chembu curry, made with eddoes, all hit the spot. Outstanding breads and charmingly chummy service. Take away if you must. 38 Sushi-Hiro, 1 Station Parade, Uxbridge Road, London, W3 Tel: 020-8896 3175 Oasis of civilised calm in hectic Ealing/Acton border country. Almost meditative tranquillity of light, bright, clean-cut, pine and white interior. Fresh sushi and sashimi jewel-like in carefully ordered selections. Fish bought daily from Billingsgate. Nigiri and chirashi options, and fancier stuff still a la carte. Reaches from bog-standard mackerel, salmon and prawn through squirmaceous eel, squid and octopus to exotic sea urchin, flying fish and abalone. Impeccable pickles. Generous wasabi and gari. Free green at end of meal. Cash only. 39 Village Restaurant and Ramson's Enoteca, 18 Market Place, Ramsbottom, Lancashire, BLO 9HTO Tel: 01706 825070 Inspirational novelty; Brit/Italian on two floors. Downstairs you'll find the delights of Italy with bruschette, cured meats and Italian artisan cheeses. Upstairs are trad-Brit favourites - potted shrimps, organic trout, cold roasts and salads. Earlybird menus (two courses, \u00a37.25; three courses, \u00a39.75) offer cold minestrone, mortadella with goat's cheese and balsamic onions, stir-fry of Goosnargh chicken and duckling, then Robbiola cheese, washed down with something from a distinctly Italian wine list. Follow up with espresso and imported grappa. 40 Yummi Yummi Noodle Bar, 8 Station Parade, Uxbridge Road, Ealing Common, London W5 Tel: 020-8992 2848 How can you resist the name? It's new. It's bright. It's clean. It's friendly. And it serves noodles (soup noodles, wok noodles, bowl noodles, Japanese udon noodles, Singaporean rice noodles, Chinese egg noodles) with shredded chicken, barbecued lemon grass chicken, stir-fired beef, prawns and pork and fish cakes with a hint of curry, with prawns, scallops, squid and vegetables. Spring rolls (Vietnamese, Chinese); dumplings, bean crepes or satay to start. All appetisers \u00a31-\u00a33.20. All noodle dishes \u00a35.50-\u00a36.80.All cooked to order. All fine, fresh, fab flavours.",

The \"pill box\" style branding is one of the most recognised symbols on the British high street. At the same time C&amp;N Touristic AG announced it would be rebranding thousands of its own-brand shops worldwide with the Thomas Cook name and even changing its corporate name to Thomas Cook AG. C&amp;N, Europe's second largest leisure group, bought the 160-year-old UK company for \u00a3550m last December. \"We have acquired one of the world's best known and respected leisure brands. We intend to take full advantage of what this gives us,\" said Stefan Pichler, the chairman and chief executive of C&amp;N. Mr Pichler said the new logo would be launched in the \"middle of the year\". It will combine the Thomas Cook name with the \"holiday colours\" of C&amp;N which are blue and yellow. \"The aim is to create a new, dynamic and contemporary feel to what is the oldest brand of travel in the world,\" added Mr Pichler. A UK spokeswoman for Thomas Cook said consumer research had revealed that \"the equity is in the name not the colour\". Despite the revamped Thomas Cook logo being rolled out to all C&amp;N retail and service outlets, the company will retain its national tour operating and airline brands such as Neckerman and Condor in Germany and the JMC brand in the UK. \"The change in our corporate name to Thomas Cook demonstrates our desire to achieve rapid integration across all our core markets,\" said Mr Pichler.",

      "bodyText": "A new Superman DVD has been released featuring footage of Christopher Reeve's 1977 screen test for the superhero role. Superman: the Movie Special Edition also includes recently discovered screen tests with several actresses who auditioned for the role of Lois Lane, which eventually went to Margot Kidder. Eight minutes of previously unseen footage have been added, including extended scenes involving Superman's father, played by screen legend Marlon Brando. Hollywood studio negotiators are cautiously optimistic after talks with screenwriters were extended for another day - amid rumours of a breakthrough. The Writers Guild of America has agreed to more talks today aimed at averting a strike, after their current contract ended. Swingers stars Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn paid for the last scene of their boxing buddy movie, Made, out of their own pockets after early test audiences called for a more upbeat ending. Writer/director Favreau initially ended the film by driving off with Vaughn and his adopted screen daughter, but film fans wanted a more clear-cut happy ending. Favreau said: \"They were right so we kicked in our pay and shot another scene at a kid's birthday party with clowns and paper hats.\" Documents lodged by Nicole Kidman yesterday confirm she was shocked at Tom Cruise's demand for a divorce when she was pregnant with their baby. Kidman states she would ask for joint custody of their two children \"contingent on [Cruise's] agreement to communicate, consult and from time to time meet directly with [Kidman].\" Kidman also said she would prefer to live in her native Australia but \"at this time\" thought best to be close to Cruise in LA.",

The author Louis de Berni\u00e8res became testily defensive about his alleged right-wing bias in the depiction of the Greek communist partisans, and, indeed, about his alleged disapproval of the film itself, which excises the difficult sex and politics and turns it into a holiday romance with silly voices on the beautiful sun-kissed island of Cephallonia. </p> <p>What a droopy, disappointing film this is. It has some of the unhappiest casting to be seen and dodgiest accents to be heard in the cinema, the worst offender being the barrel-chested, horse-faced Nicolas Cage as a captain in the Italian army (the comically incompetent innocents of fascism, apparently) who charms the socks, and indeed the pants, off the gorgeous Pelagia (Penelope Cruz). This he achieves with his sensitive love of music and that famous mandolin, which he has nestling pertly in his knapsack in lieu of a field marshal's baton. He and his adorable comrades want nothing more than to hang out on the beach, running in and out of the surf like the Monkees, singing and snogging their imported ladies of ill repute. \"We are-a Italian-a!\" explains Mr Cage, with a twinkle in his eye, \"famous-a for-a singing-a! Eating-a! And making-a leeeeeeeurrrve!\" </p> <p>When he gets his mandolin out and starts twanging away, everyone swoons, but the idea of music transcending the divisive brutality of war and nationalism is completely lost. The music in the film is dire: Cage's singing is groan-inducing (I'm pretty sure it's not supposed to be that bad) and Corelli's composition, Pelagia's Theme, sounds sugary and bland. Frankly, no one could look more ill-at-ease or unconvincing with a musical instrument, and with so much broad comedy in his performance it would not be very surprising if Cage tried blowing into it. </p> <p>So much for the American playing the Italian. Cruz is Spanish playing a Greek speaking in English in a kind of non-specific European voice; and David Morrissey (a generally excellent actor here forced into the role of uptight German officer) appears to be history's only recorded Scouse Nazi. The only actor really at home seems to be John Hurt as Dr Iannis, Pelagia's father - his face lizardly, impassive and sunburned, the corners of his mouth turned uncompromisingly down. He has the film's one really disturbing and powerful moment, when, as war is declared, he gives Pelagia a revolver - an oddly new-looking and well-maintained weapon - and tells her that she must not hesitate to use it on herself if necessary. </p> <p>What tears at Pelagia's heart is that before war came, with its inappropriate and unpatriotic longings, she was betrothed to Mandras (Christian Bale), a stout-hearted local fisherman who enlists and then returns to join the communist partisans following an unequal military struggle against the Italians and Germans. These are not the villainous brutes of the novel, but Mandras is nevertheless shown turning a blind eye as a local woman is lynched for consorting with a German officer. (Perhaps it should be said that De Berni\u00e8res' demonisation of the Greek communists is arguably in a distinctive British tradition inherited from Churchill, who boasted of saving post-war Greece from Stalin and was openly contemptuous of the partisans' struggle against the Nazis.) </p> <p>But Mandras redeems himself at the end, and in any case, when Mussolini surrenders to the Allies, the Italians inherit the Greeks' victim status, and the movie shows them appearing to make a kind of chaotic, muddled common cause with Greece against the Third Reich. </p> <p>John Madden's picture looks splendid - how could it not? - and the battle scenes in the final reel are managed with elan. But all the vitally emotional warfare is muted. So much emphasis is placed on the picturesque innocence of Pelagia's love in this Eden-like setting, and a miraculously equivalent innocence on the part of an Italian army officer, that the harsh realities of war, violence and betrayal seem weirdly pallid and inconsequential. </p> <p>In the end, Cage's Corelli and Cruz's Pelagia seem more like children than much else: babes in the dark wood of 20th-century history - and perhaps that is part of the story's popularity. But you long for the film to grow up and give us a story about plausible adults.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong> David Byrne </strong>Look Into the Eyeball <br>(Virgin/Luaka Bop) **** <br> \u00a314.99<br> </p> <p> These days, pop stars are available in only three varieties: Manufactured, Neanderthal and Boring Bloke. In the early 1980s, however, a different genus existed. Art school-educated and influenced by glam eggheads David Bowie and Roxy Music, the Brainy pop star made the top 10 shoehorning cleverclogs stuff about art and sociology into quirkily commercial singles. Britain had David Sylvian and Scritti Politti's Green Gartside, while America had Talking Heads frontman David Byrne. Most Brainy pop stars eventually traded hits for highbrow pursuits: Byrne has spent the decade since Talking Heads split scoring ballets and exploring world music. Stimulating for him, perhaps, but less fun for the listener, a state of affairs highlighted by Look Into the Eyeball's return to unabashed pop. The Great Intoxication and the lovely Philly soul pastiche Neighborhood marshal Byrne's arch lyrics and scholarly musical enthusiasms - Brazilian rhythms, bursts of atonal jazz and electronica, knowing mimicry - behind careening, carefree melodies that recall the naive romance of 1940s showtunes. The result is Byrne's best since 1985's Little Creatures: sumptuously orchestrated, effortlessly droll and - of course - as brainy as they come. (AP) </p> <p><strong> Michael Franti and Spearhead </strong> Stay Human <br>(Parlophone) *** <br> \u00a314.99<br> </p> <p> Rapper and vocalist Michael Franti has always been an anomalous figure in hip-hop. In the early 1990s, when gangster rap's funk samples and trigger-happy lyrics ruled supreme, Franti's Disposable Heroes of HipHoprisy sampled livid industrial noise and wrote Noam Chomsky-influenced raps about mass media's destructive influence on individual thought. While Franti's words remain committed as ever, his current band Spearhead back his sung-spoken musings on government corruption and racism with jazzy funk and, on Thank You, even disco. Curiously, however, as Franti has moved from rap into Gil Scott-Heron territory, he has fallen prey to one of hip-hop's most pernicious evils: the \"skit\". Stay Human features nine of these irritating spoken-word interludes; telling an initially provocative tale about death row and starring Woody Harrelson as an unrepentant state governor, they quickly become irksome, interrupting the album's flow. Judicious use of the fast-forward button becomes a must if Stay Human is to get the repeated listening it deserves. (AP) </p> <p><strong> Moldy Peaches </strong> Moldy Peaches <br>(Rough Trade)**** <br> \u00a39.99<br> </p> <p> While the naive wisdom of childhood is eroded in most of us by responsibility and respectability, Adam Green and Kimya Dawson have not only clung to the surreal images and outspoken brashness of youth but distilled it into an artform. Using Sesame Street singalongs as a template, Moldy Peaches sing about the bare essentials and fleeting emotions of life with New York cool and laughter in their voices. Nothing Came Out has Dawson trying to tell a boy she likes him in words of heartfelt innocence. \"You're probably holding hands with some pretty skinny girl who likes to talk about bands,\" she sings, yearning to watch cartoons with the object of her affection. All the motifs of childhood are here, from Converse trainers and Duran Duran to MP3s, BMXs and rollerskates. In many of the songs Green and Dawson handle a line each, punk poets disguised as Nancy Sinatra and Dean Martin against a background of guitars and hiss. The recording is deliberately crude, the impression one of two cynical, introspective kids with heads full of ideas, let loose with a tape recorder. While the duo rock out on the fantastic NYC's Like a Graveyard and Who's Got the Crack, it's the fragile melodies and honesty that linger. Anyone Else But You, which describes the central relationship as \"part-time lover and a full-time friend\" is the highlight of an album that is sweetly crazy and completely memorable. (BC) </p> <p><strong> The Black Crowes </strong> Lions <br>(V2) ** <br> \u00a313.99<br> </p> <p> The Black Crowes, stalwarts of good-time rock'n'roll, are cool. A recent secret show was stuffed to the rafters with the London showbiz elite; soon they'll be touring the US, co-headlining with Oasis - it's the latest thing to be down with their long hair, meandering guitar solos and outbursts of \"Awwhhhhh!\" Lions is the band's sixth album and although the keyboards are a little bit more inventive, it's still the traditional spit and sawdust, late night Black Crowes sound. Here women lay their men down. A lot. In fact, the Black Crowes may be the least pro-active bunch in rock. But the lyrics aren't what counts, it's the laid-back, blues-influenced vibe that's important. When it's there, it's good. Lay It All on Me tames Chris Robinson's shrieky vocals with a melancholy mood of subtle riffs and sleazy piano, and Losin' My Mind is a ballsy ballad spoilt only by the way each track runs abruptly into the next. But much of Lions is tiring, the sound of the maudlin rather than the cocksure drunk in the corner. It's in stadiums, not bedrooms that the Black Crowes belong. Come On's pomp and stomp will please the faithful but, despite what the cool kids say, the Faces did it better. (BC) </p> <p><strong> Paul McCartney</strong> Wingspan - Hits and History <br>(Parlophone, 2 CDs) **** <br> \u00a316.99<br> </p> <p> Faced with the challenge of developing a post-Beatles career, Paul McCartney devised Wings as a kind of surrogate family, bringing his wife Linda along for moral support. The group always felt vaguely insubstantial and somehow unserious, but as this double-disc anthology demonstrates, the Wings years (1971-80) produced an impressive streak of hits: Band on the Run, Jet, Live and Let Die, My Love... and Mull of Kintyre. It isn't all Wings material here, though, since there are also extracts from Sir Fab's solo albums, not least Maybe I'm Amazed and Take It Away. Meanwhile, the CDs fit into a grand strategic plan that also includes a two-hour TV documentary tracing the inside story of Wings. Yes, there was life after the Moptops.

Blessed with a light, flexible voice that can plumb growling depths when required, Bibb interprets his remit as broadly as possible. Delia's Gone is a nifty specimen of nimble vocals and sprightly guitar-pickin', while both the sound and the sentiment of Hope in a Hopeless World owe more than a passing debt to Marvin Gaye in his \"social justice\" mode.

They are a six-man a cappella group from Cuba who use no backing tracks or instruments, but manage to sound like a full Latin orchestra. Other singers may mimic the sounds of particular instruments - it's a gimmick that has been used by anyone from Bobby McFerrin to Jose Alberto - but this group imitate everything from double bass and percussion through to strings, guitar and brass. They're so good at it that you almost forget you are listening only to vocalists. Their sense of rhythm is impeccable, and so are their elaborate arrangements, which switch between salsa, jazz and do-wop, often within the same song. Their dance pieces actually swing, their revival of that well-worn standard Guantanamera is inspired, thanks to what sounds like a slick, big-band brass arrangement, and they even take a spine-tingling stab at the Richard Strauss epic known in Havana as Asi Hablaba Zarathustra.

Even if they are essentially just adding a new coat of paint to the same retro structure, they do it with a certain panache.

      "bodyText": "David Byrne Look Into the Eyeball (Virgin/Luaka Bop) **** \u00a314.99 These days, pop stars are available in only three varieties: Manufactured, Neanderthal and Boring Bloke. In the early 1980s, however, a different genus existed. Art school-educated and influenced by glam eggheads David Bowie and Roxy Music, the Brainy pop star made the top 10 shoehorning cleverclogs stuff about art and sociology into quirkily commercial singles. Britain had David Sylvian and Scritti Politti's Green Gartside, while America had Talking Heads frontman David Byrne. Most Brainy pop stars eventually traded hits for highbrow pursuits: Byrne has spent the decade since Talking Heads split scoring ballets and exploring world music. Stimulating for him, perhaps, but less fun for the listener, a state of affairs highlighted by Look Into the Eyeball's return to unabashed pop. The Great Intoxication and the lovely Philly soul pastiche Neighborhood marshal Byrne's arch lyrics and scholarly musical enthusiasms - Brazilian rhythms, bursts of atonal jazz and electronica, knowing mimicry - behind careening, carefree melodies that recall the naive romance of 1940s showtunes. The result is Byrne's best since 1985's Little Creatures: sumptuously orchestrated, effortlessly droll and - of course - as brainy as they come. (AP) Michael Franti and Spearhead Stay Human (Parlophone) *** \u00a314.99 Rapper and vocalist Michael Franti has always been an anomalous figure in hip-hop. In the early 1990s, when gangster rap's funk samples and trigger-happy lyrics ruled supreme, Franti's Disposable Heroes of HipHoprisy sampled livid industrial noise and wrote Noam Chomsky-influenced raps about mass media's destructive influence on individual thought. While Franti's words remain committed as ever, his current band Spearhead back his sung-spoken musings on government corruption and racism with jazzy funk and, on Thank You, even disco. Curiously, however, as Franti has moved from rap into Gil Scott-Heron territory, he has fallen prey to one of hip-hop's most pernicious evils: the \"skit\". Stay Human features nine of these irritating spoken-word interludes; telling an initially provocative tale about death row and starring Woody Harrelson as an unrepentant state governor, they quickly become irksome, interrupting the album's flow. Judicious use of the fast-forward button becomes a must if Stay Human is to get the repeated listening it deserves. (AP) Moldy Peaches Moldy Peaches (Rough Trade)**** \u00a39.99 While the naive wisdom of childhood is eroded in most of us by responsibility and respectability, Adam Green and Kimya Dawson have not only clung to the surreal images and outspoken brashness of youth but distilled it into an artform. Using Sesame Street singalongs as a template, Moldy Peaches sing about the bare essentials and fleeting emotions of life with New York cool and laughter in their voices. Nothing Came Out has Dawson trying to tell a boy she likes him in words of heartfelt innocence. \"You're probably holding hands with some pretty skinny girl who likes to talk about bands,\" she sings, yearning to watch cartoons with the object of her affection. All the motifs of childhood are here, from Converse trainers and Duran Duran to MP3s, BMXs and rollerskates. In many of the songs Green and Dawson handle a line each, punk poets disguised as Nancy Sinatra and Dean Martin against a background of guitars and hiss. The recording is deliberately crude, the impression one of two cynical, introspective kids with heads full of ideas, let loose with a tape recorder. While the duo rock out on the fantastic NYC's Like a Graveyard and Who's Got the Crack, it's the fragile melodies and honesty that linger. Anyone Else But You, which describes the central relationship as \"part-time lover and a full-time friend\" is the highlight of an album that is sweetly crazy and completely memorable. (BC) The Black Crowes Lions (V2) ** \u00a313.99 The Black Crowes, stalwarts of good-time rock'n'roll, are cool. A recent secret show was stuffed to the rafters with the London showbiz elite; soon they'll be touring the US, co-headlining with Oasis - it's the latest thing to be down with their long hair, meandering guitar solos and outbursts of \"Awwhhhhh!\" Lions is the band's sixth album and although the keyboards are a little bit more inventive, it's still the traditional spit and sawdust, late night Black Crowes sound. Here women lay their men down. A lot. In fact, the Black Crowes may be the least pro-active bunch in rock. But the lyrics aren't what counts, it's the laid-back, blues-influenced vibe that's important. When it's there, it's good. Lay It All on Me tames Chris Robinson's shrieky vocals with a melancholy mood of subtle riffs and sleazy piano, and Losin' My Mind is a ballsy ballad spoilt only by the way each track runs abruptly into the next. But much of Lions is tiring, the sound of the maudlin rather than the cocksure drunk in the corner. It's in stadiums, not bedrooms that the Black Crowes belong. Come On's pomp and stomp will please the faithful but, despite what the cool kids say, the Faces did it better. (BC) Paul McCartney Wingspan - Hits and History (Parlophone, 2 CDs) **** \u00a316.99 Faced with the challenge of developing a post-Beatles career, Paul McCartney devised Wings as a kind of surrogate family, bringing his wife Linda along for moral support. The group always felt vaguely insubstantial and somehow unserious, but as this double-disc anthology demonstrates, the Wings years (1971-80) produced an impressive streak of hits: Band on the Run, Jet, Live and Let Die, My Love... and Mull of Kintyre. It isn't all Wings material here, though, since there are also extracts from Sir Fab's solo albums, not least Maybe I'm Amazed and Take It Away. Meanwhile, the CDs fit into a grand strategic plan that also includes a two-hour TV documentary tracing the inside story of Wings. Yes, there was life after the Moptops. (AS) Eric Bibb Painting Signs (Manhaton Records) **** \u00a313.99 It's hard work digging new life out of the much-shovelled earth of da bloooze, but Eric Bibb does it better than most. Blessed with a light, flexible voice that can plumb growling depths when required, Bibb interprets his remit as broadly as possible.

The Bury men actually began work on this debut album in 1998 upon signing to Island Records.

Hollis's band Talk Talk released no records that year, but he spent it transforming them from pretty pop pin-ups who supported fellow new romantics Duran Duran into a meandering but beautiful beast. Talk Talk's 1986 album, The Colour of Spring, sought and found kinship with the lyrical and musical complexities of Nick Drake, John Coltrane and an irony-free Steely Dan. </p> <p>Elbow stick to Hollis's template more rigidly than Radiohead, Coldplay or The Blue Nile, who have all - consciously, or by our friend osmosis - followed this particular route. Like Hollis, singer and lyricist Guy Garvey has a cusp-of-quiet-desperation catch in his voice as he floats across Little Beast, a portrait of smalltown, small-time ennui and violence, and wearily lists his own failings in death- rattle fashion on the even more etiolated Can't Stop. Hollis, however, would never have allowed himself the almighty cathartic howl that Garvey hollers towards the end of Powder Blue. </p> <p>But Garvey is not just yet another woe-is-me lyricist who never saw the shards of humour in Leonard Cohen. By any yardstick, whether observing others or unveiling enticing globules of himself, Garvey's is a fertile mind. For every moment of lyrical indulgence, there are many that are magical and he is a master of the arresting image, be it \"the girl's a priest (to me at least)\" of Little Beast, or what turns out to be the lovelorn notion that \"I'll be the corpse in your bathtub\" on Newborn. </p> <p>Intriguingly, the characters in Garvey's less than benign world share little but their dissatisfaction: a yearning to escape, mixed with a harkening to better times. He stumbles occasionally - Red's cliched tale of someone else's drug addiction simply doesn't ring true - but for the most part he strides boldly, and Newborn's tale of young lovers plotting their old age together (\"You'll spend the end of your days smiling gently, like a newborn\") is desperately moving and atypically optimistic. </p> <p>He flees a grim smalltown (unsurprisingly, Elbow have already raised the heckles of Bury council, unroused since they erected a plaque to their other famous son, Robert Whitehead, inventor of the torpedo) on Any Day Now; watches another couple's relationship collapse on Powder Blue; has a friend whose girlfriend falls pregnant on Presuming Ed (Rest Easy) - \"you need to chill your fucking bones,\" he advises, sagely - and elegiacally trawls through his childhood on Scattered Black &amp; Whites. </p> <p>Musically, Elbow do enough to distance themselves from the herd. None of these 11 songs is hurried through and they correctly understand that a freeform approach need not necessar ily mean eschewing melody. Rather, it gives them the freedom to do as they please without losing sight of the song. Like Nelson Mandela, they use their freedom wisely. </p> <p>Thus, angular guitar solos meet tom-tom percussion - drummer Richard Jupp is Elbow's busiest bee - and layered vocals on Bitten by the Tailfly. Scattered Black &amp; Whites teasingly begins as Talk Talk homage before almost breaking into U2's Where the Streets Have No Name. What sounds like a Star Wars wookie roars through Coming Second and the harmonic epiphany during Presuming Ed (Rest Easy) is so complex and uplifting it could have been a Todd Rundgren vocal arrangement. And that's before the nods to classical, avant-garde, pop and the Joy Division-style breaking glass that closes Powder Blue. </p> <p>Although rarely inaccessible, Elbow are hardly easy listening and Coming Second is genuinely harrowing. Moreover, although they do nothing new, they have a bigger melting pot and less fear of using it than their peers. However, in an era where music for squaddies may yet take over and the return of a band as vacuous as Stereo MC's is seen as some kind of British cultural renaissance, Elbow fly a tattered flag for grumpy intelligence with a heart-wrenching streak.</p>",

It was George Butterworth who in 1910 convinced Vaughan Williams that he was ready to compose a purely orchestral symphony to follow the choral work that was his first essay in symphonic form, the Sea Symphony. The score of the new work was completed by the end of 1913 - a portrait of London life that was initially inspired by HG Wells's novel Tono-Bungay. The first performance took place the following March. </p> <p>Soon after that, the manuscript of the full score was lost somewhere in Germany and for another performance in 1915 the work had to be reconstructed from the orchestral parts, with Butterworth himself lending a hand; a year later the young, hugely talented composer was killed at the Somme, and Vaughan Williams dedicated the London Symphony to Butterworth's memory. Soon after that, however, he began to have misgivings about the shape and even the intention of the symphony, playing down its illustrative elements, and revising the work three times, before finally publishing it in the mid-1930s. </p> <p>That final edition of A London Symphony is the one that has been played ever since, but now Richard Hickox has been able to go back to the 1913 score for this eloquently played and spacious premiere recording. The composer's widow, Ursula Vaughan Williams, granted permission for a disc to be made, on the understanding that it would never be performed in concert. What's most startling about this exhumation is the sheer length of the original work; it lasts 61 minutes, whereas most performances of the standard score take around 40. Convinced that his scheme was unwieldy, Vaughan Williams seems to have pruned the work more heavily as it went on: he left the first movement unchanged, but made nips and tucks in both the slow movement and the scherzo, and cut great swathes of material from the finale. </p> <p>Some of the excisions seem to have been sensible - the finale is dangerously episodic in the first version - but Williams seems to have been motivated to cut so much partly by his increasingly clear idea through the 1920s and early 30s of what a taut symphonic argument should be, but also by his belief that the piece should stand or fall by its success as abstract music and not rely on descriptive associations. Much of what was removed is music of vivid poetic description. Admirers of Vaughan Williams will certainly want to hear all this restored music, some of it of a very high quality indeed, and while it does not supplant the version of the work that we know, it makes a very worthwhile addition to the catalogue.</p>",

It was George Butterworth who in 1910 convinced Vaughan Williams that he was ready to compose a purely orchestral symphony to follow the choral work that was his first essay in symphonic form, the Sea Symphony. The score of the new work was completed by the end of 1913 - a portrait of London life that was initially inspired by HG Wells's novel Tono-Bungay. The first performance took place the following March. Soon after that, the manuscript of the full score was lost somewhere in Germany and for another performance in 1915 the work had to be reconstructed from the orchestral parts, with Butterworth himself lending a hand; a year later the young, hugely talented composer was killed at the Somme, and Vaughan Williams dedicated the London Symphony to Butterworth's memory. Soon after that, however, he began to have misgivings about the shape and even the intention of the symphony, playing down its illustrative elements, and revising the work three times, before finally publishing it in the mid-1930s. That final edition of A London Symphony is the one that has been played ever since, but now Richard Hickox has been able to go back to the 1913 score for this eloquently played and spacious premiere recording. The composer's widow, Ursula Vaughan Williams, granted permission for a disc to be made, on the understanding that it would never be performed in concert. What's most startling about this exhumation is the sheer length of the original work; it lasts 61 minutes, whereas most performances of the standard score take around 40. Convinced that his scheme was unwieldy, Vaughan Williams seems to have pruned the work more heavily as it went on: he left the first movement unchanged, but made nips and tucks in both the slow movement and the scherzo, and cut great swathes of material from the finale. Some of the excisions seem to have been sensible - the finale is dangerously episodic in the first version - but Williams seems to have been motivated to cut so much partly by his increasingly clear idea through the 1920s and early 30s of what a taut symphonic argument should be, but also by his belief that the piece should stand or fall by its success as abstract music and not rely on descriptive associations. Much of what was removed is music of vivid poetic description. Admirers of Vaughan Williams will certainly want to hear all this restored music, some of it of a very high quality indeed, and while it does not supplant the version of the work that we know, it makes a very worthwhile addition to the catalogue.",

      "body": "<p><strong> Ligeti: Melodien; Chamber Concerto; Piano Concerto; Mysteries of the Macabre </strong><br> Aimard/Masseurs/ Schoenberg &amp; Asko Ensembles/De Leeuw (Teldec) **** <br> \u00a314.99<br> </p> <p> After eight releases, Sony Classical's complete Ligeti edition has come to a premature end with all the orchestral works still to be issued, and the project has been taken up by Teldec. This first instalment suggests that standards will be just as high under Reinbert de Leeuw as they were under Esa-Pekka Salonen for Sony. All the works have been released on disc before, even though Teldec claim Mysteries of the Macabre, a trumpet and ensemble spin-off from the opera Le Grand Macabre, as a premiere recording. Pierre-Laurent Aimard's earlier account of the Piano Concerto, conducted by Boulez on Deutsche Grammophon, is arguably more convincing, more sharply defined, than this one, but de Leeuw's accounts of Melodien and the Chamber Concerto, two of the finest ensemble works of the 1970s, are models of clarity and unfussy virtuosity. </p> <p><strong> Keiser: Der Geliebte Adonis </strong> <br>Zumbult/Popken/Spogis/ Ryden/Capella Orlandi Bremen/Ihlenfeldt <br> (CPO, three CDs) ** <br> \u00a326.99<br> </p> <p> One of the unexpected highlights of last year's CD releases was Reinhard Keiser's Croesus, in a performance conducted by Rene Jacobs for Harmonia Mundi. The power and inventiveness of this opera suggested that Keiser (1674-1739) was much more than just an historically important figure in the development of opera - he was the leading German practitioner of his day, and a precursor of Handel. He was also an original composer in his own right whose works fully deserved further exploration today. Der Geliebte Adonis, first performed in 1697 and based on the story of Venus and Adonis, is the earliest of Keiser's surviving stage works, and contains some telling numbers, but in general the level of originality is far below that of his later scores. In a first-rate performance it might seem more worthwhile but this concert performance from Bremen is simply not distinguished enough, vocally or instrumentally to make it convincing. </p> <p><strong> Scelsi: Hymnos; Hurqualia; Konx- Om-Pax; Canti del Capricorno </strong><br> Vaillancourt/Ahlstedt/ Carnegie Mellon Philharmonic &amp; Concert Choir/Izquierdo <br>(Mode) *** <br> \u00a313.99<br> </p> <p> \"The history of the second half of the 20th century is unthinkable without Giacinto Scelsi\", claims the sleeve note for this second volume in Mode's series devoted to the orchestral works of this elusive composer. While there's no doubt that his music, with its intense concentration on the minutiae of sounds and monolithic sense of form is thoroughly individual, whether it is really significant is another matter altogether. The three big pieces here, interspersed with a selection of the solo vocal Canti di Capricorno, date from the 1960s. Both Hurqualia, for large orchestra, and Hymnos, for organ and two orchestras, nag away at single pitches, creating clouds of microtones around them, while Konx-Om Pax is a huge assemblage of sound involving a large chorus. The general contour of the three works is much the same, a remorseless progression to a gigantic climax and then an ebbing away; for Scelsi, the details of the musical journey mattered more than the point of arrival. </p> <p><strong> Bartok: Concerto for Orchestra; Dance Suite; Miraculous Mandarin Suite </strong> <br>London Symphony/Solti <br>(Decca) ***** <br> \u00a38.99<br> </p> <p> Since it first appeared in 1965, Georg Solti's electrifying account of the Concerto for Orchestra has only occasionally been matched on disc and never superseded. One of the finest recordings that Solti ever made, his propulsiveness and rhythmic precision are ideal for a work that can so easily sound glib and four-square. With top-class playing from the LSO it acquires real freshness and sense of dramatic purpose. Solti is equally successful in energising the Dance Suite, pungently characterising each folk tune, and making sure that the orchestral colours come through with total immediacy. For the reissue in the Legends series, this original coupling has been augmented by a 1963 version of The Miraculous Mandarin, equally driven and theatrical, though it is in the unsatisfactory suite form rather than the full ballet. </p> <p><strong> Beethoven: Diabelli Variations </strong><br> Piotr Anderszewski <br> (Virgin Classics) ***** <br> \u00a314.99<br> </p> <p> The Polish-born Anderszewski first attracted attention at the Leeds piano competition in 1990, when he abandoned his semi-final recital in mid-performance because he was dissatisfied with his own playing. It did him no harm: since then his reputation has steadily burgeoned. But though he has made two discs with the violinist Viktoria Mullova, he is only now really being taken up by the recording industry, and this compelling version of the Diabelli is a wonderful and auspicious start. Anderszewski's performance takes 63 minutes - most versions come in around 55 - yet the presence and magnetism of his playing are such that it never seems a moment too long, with every variation deeply considered and presented in a sometimes startling new light. This is piano playing of the highest class.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ligeti: Melodien; Chamber Concerto; Piano Concerto; Mysteries of the Macabre Aimard/Masseurs/ Schoenberg &amp; Asko Ensembles/De Leeuw (Teldec) **** \u00a314.99 After eight releases, Sony Classical's complete Ligeti edition has come to a premature end with all the orchestral works still to be issued, and the project has been taken up by Teldec. This first instalment suggests that standards will be just as high under Reinbert de Leeuw as they were under Esa-Pekka Salonen for Sony. All the works have been released on disc before, even though Teldec claim Mysteries of the Macabre, a trumpet and ensemble spin-off from the opera Le Grand Macabre, as a premiere recording. Pierre-Laurent Aimard's earlier account of the Piano Concerto, conducted by Boulez on Deutsche Grammophon, is arguably more convincing, more sharply defined, than this one, but de Leeuw's accounts of Melodien and the Chamber Concerto, two of the finest ensemble works of the 1970s, are models of clarity and unfussy virtuosity. Keiser: Der Geliebte Adonis Zumbult/Popken/Spogis/ Ryden/Capella Orlandi Bremen/Ihlenfeldt (CPO, three CDs) ** \u00a326.99 One of the unexpected highlights of last year's CD releases was Reinhard Keiser's Croesus, in a performance conducted by Rene Jacobs for Harmonia Mundi. The power and inventiveness of this opera suggested that Keiser (1674-1739) was much more than just an historically important figure in the development of opera - he was the leading German practitioner of his day, and a precursor of Handel. He was also an original composer in his own right whose works fully deserved further exploration today. Der Geliebte Adonis, first performed in 1697 and based on the story of Venus and Adonis, is the earliest of Keiser's surviving stage works, and contains some telling numbers, but in general the level of originality is far below that of his later scores. In a first-rate performance it might seem more worthwhile but this concert performance from Bremen is simply not distinguished enough, vocally or instrumentally to make it convincing. Scelsi: Hymnos; Hurqualia; Konx- Om-Pax; Canti del Capricorno Vaillancourt/Ahlstedt/ Carnegie Mellon Philharmonic &amp; Concert Choir/Izquierdo (Mode) *** \u00a313.99 \"The history of the second half of the 20th century is unthinkable without Giacinto Scelsi\", claims the sleeve note for this second volume in Mode's series devoted to the orchestral works of this elusive composer. While there's no doubt that his music, with its intense concentration on the minutiae of sounds and monolithic sense of form is thoroughly individual, whether it is really significant is another matter altogether. The three big pieces here, interspersed with a selection of the solo vocal Canti di Capricorno, date from the 1960s. Both Hurqualia, for large orchestra, and Hymnos, for organ and two orchestras, nag away at single pitches, creating clouds of microtones around them, while Konx-Om Pax is a huge assemblage of sound involving a large chorus. The general contour of the three works is much the same, a remorseless progression to a gigantic climax and then an ebbing away; for Scelsi, the details of the musical journey mattered more than the point of arrival. Bartok: Concerto for Orchestra; Dance Suite; Miraculous Mandarin Suite London Symphony/Solti (Decca) ***** \u00a38.99 Since it first appeared in 1965, Georg Solti's electrifying account of the Concerto for Orchestra has only occasionally been matched on disc and never superseded. One of the finest recordings that Solti ever made, his propulsiveness and rhythmic precision are ideal for a work that can so easily sound glib and four-square. With top-class playing from the LSO it acquires real freshness and sense of dramatic purpose. Solti is equally successful in energising the Dance Suite, pungently characterising each folk tune, and making sure that the orchestral colours come through with total immediacy. For the reissue in the Legends series, this original coupling has been augmented by a 1963 version of The Miraculous Mandarin, equally driven and theatrical, though it is in the unsatisfactory suite form rather than the full ballet. Beethoven: Diabelli Variations Piotr Anderszewski (Virgin Classics) ***** \u00a314.99 The Polish-born Anderszewski first attracted attention at the Leeds piano competition in 1990, when he abandoned his semi-final recital in mid-performance because he was dissatisfied with his own playing. It did him no harm: since then his reputation has steadily burgeoned. But though he has made two discs with the violinist Viktoria Mullova, he is only now really being taken up by the recording industry, and this compelling version of the Diabelli is a wonderful and auspicious start. Anderszewski's performance takes 63 minutes - most versions come in around 55 - yet the presence and magnetism of his playing are such that it never seems a moment too long, with every variation deeply considered and presented in a sometimes startling new light. This is piano playing of the highest class.",

      "body": "<p>A small tragedy is unfolding that could and should be prevented. A credit union held up as a famous model of self-help in one of the poorest places is about to crash. Some 3,000 people stand to loose every penny of their very hard-earned life savings.</p> <p>At conferences on social exclusion, the Camberwell Credit Union has been presented as the exemplar, with its members testifying movingly to how it saved them from loan shark penury and above all, how it gave them pride in their local community as they banded together to create something for themselves. Credit unions have been extolled time and again by Labour ministers. But now its members face a shattering loss. </p> <p>It was mainly West Indians who founded the union some 20 years ago when they were denied ordinary bank accounts. So they set up their own community bank on the North Peckham estate, (where Damilola Taylor was murdered), drawing in people from every background paying in some \u00a35 a week. </p> <p>They include the student single mother who scraped together \u00a3220 for her son's future, the Irish widow on benefits with two children who will lose \u00a3350, the 67-year-old West Indian chef who will lose \u00a33,500 for his old age and the elderly woman whose son put \u00a35,000 into her account as she had no savings; 24 people had \u00a3800 each put into their accounts by Southwark council for new furnishings when they were decanted while the estate is rebuilt. </p> <p>They have all been told that due to bad debts, they will only get 50p in the pound back: if it is forced to close, the liquidators fees will take the rest. </p> <p>The Financial Services Authority (FSA) discovered a shortfall of \u00a3200,000 and ordered the books to be frozen as an insolvent organisation. It was not fraud but over-lenient lending that destroyed them, as has happened before with these small, amateur run banks. </p> <p>The very thing that makes credit unions so attractive to urban regenerators, encouraging social enterprise with deep community roots, is also what makes them perilously vulnerable. If Camberwell goes under it will send a frightening message to all the other 450 community credit unions. Expect a run on them by vulnerable people who simply cannot afford to take any risks. It could spell the end for many small community unions. </p> <p>A rescue is being attempted by Harriet Harman together with Tessa Jowell, whose constituents are among the losers. The FSA is doing what it can to help. Southwark council has put in \u00a320,000. The necessary \u00a3200,000 is not a large sum for the Treasury and big banks to stump up between them. But the Treasury has so far refused, claiming it would set a precedent for bailing others out. </p> <p>However, as from July 2002 an excellent new law designed to strengthen credit unions will bring their members under the same umbrella as banks, protecting savers from any future collapse. So a Treasury rescue only risks a minor precedent for another year. </p> <p>The British Banking Association has been asked for help too, but so far not a penny has been forthcoming. Banks have no interest in picking up 3,000 poor customers who cost more than they bring in.

      "bodyText": "A small tragedy is unfolding that could and should be prevented. A credit union held up as a famous model of self-help in one of the poorest places is about to crash. Some 3,000 people stand to loose every penny of their very hard-earned life savings. At conferences on social exclusion, the Camberwell Credit Union has been presented as the exemplar, with its members testifying movingly to how it saved them from loan shark penury and above all, how it gave them pride in their local community as they banded together to create something for themselves. Credit unions have been extolled time and again by Labour ministers. But now its members face a shattering loss. It was mainly West Indians who founded the union some 20 years ago when they were denied ordinary bank accounts. So they set up their own community bank on the North Peckham estate, (where Damilola Taylor was murdered), drawing in people from every background paying in some \u00a35 a week. They include the student single mother who scraped together \u00a3220 for her son's future, the Irish widow on benefits with two children who will lose \u00a3350, the 67-year-old West Indian chef who will lose \u00a33,500 for his old age and the elderly woman whose son put \u00a35,000 into her account as she had no savings; 24 people had \u00a3800 each put into their accounts by Southwark council for new furnishings when they were decanted while the estate is rebuilt. They have all been told that due to bad debts, they will only get 50p in the pound back: if it is forced to close, the liquidators fees will take the rest. The Financial Services Authority (FSA) discovered a shortfall of \u00a3200,000 and ordered the books to be frozen as an insolvent organisation. It was not fraud but over-lenient lending that destroyed them, as has happened before with these small, amateur run banks. The very thing that makes credit unions so attractive to urban regenerators, encouraging social enterprise with deep community roots, is also what makes them perilously vulnerable. If Camberwell goes under it will send a frightening message to all the other 450 community credit unions. Expect a run on them by vulnerable people who simply cannot afford to take any risks. It could spell the end for many small community unions. A rescue is being attempted by Harriet Harman together with Tessa Jowell, whose constituents are among the losers. The FSA is doing what it can to help. Southwark council has put in \u00a320,000. The necessary \u00a3200,000 is not a large sum for the Treasury and big banks to stump up between them. But the Treasury has so far refused, claiming it would set a precedent for bailing others out. However, as from July 2002 an excellent new law designed to strengthen credit unions will bring their members under the same umbrella as banks, protecting savers from any future collapse. So a Treasury rescue only risks a minor precedent for another year. The British Banking Association has been asked for help too, but so far not a penny has been forthcoming. Banks have no interest in picking up 3,000 poor customers who cost more than they bring in. The only hope is that some might see this good cause will bring them better publicity than they could ever buy with a mere \u00a3200,000 of advertising. Particularly as the money would only be needed as a long-term guarantee and they would probably get it back. \"Financial exclusion\" has much exercised this government - a big phrase for not having any money.

The mayor has some small achievements he can be proud of. He is beginning to get conductors back on buses, the proper policing of bus lanes will begin soon and his initiative for free travel for school trips has captured Londoners' imagination.

But the UKCC said most of the 29,119 overseas-trained applicants in 2000/01 were on \"adaptation courses\" lasting from six to nine months to prepare them for work in British hospitals.</p> <p>\"This means that 2001/02 will see a very large increase in overseas registrations,\" the council said.</p> <p>Last year the number of overseas-trained nurses reaching the register rose by 4.1% to 7,705.</p> <p>The influx is likely to come in the nick of time for health ministers, who saw the shortage of staff as the main obstacle to their plans to improve the NHS.</p> <p>Alan Milburn, the health secretary, committed the government to increase the number of nurses by 20,000 by 2004, GPs by 2,500 and consultants by 7,500.</p> <p>Last year ministers told NHS trusts they should not recruit nurses from developing places where they were in short sup ply, such as South Africa and the West Indies. Last month John Denham, the health minister, extended the instruction to cover employment agencies.</p> <p>He said they would be blacklisted by the NHS if they failed to honour a revised code of practice banning poaching from countries that were battling to raise health standards.</p> <p>But the government has not interfered with the freedom of movement of individual nurses coming to Britain of their own accord to seek jobs in the NHS.</p> <p>The number applying to get on the UK register from the Philippines - where there is a surplus of trained nurses - more than doubled from 5,643 in 1999/2000 to 13,750 in 2000/01.</p> <p>Over the same period applications from India nearly trebled from 880 to 2,459.

      "bodyText": "A huge influx of foreign nurses is about to rescue the NHS from staff shortages that were threatening to undermine the government's plans to expand hospitals. Figures released yesterday by the UK Central Council for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting showed a 71.1% increase in overseas-trained nurses applying to get on the UK register during the 12 months to the end of March. They included 13,750 from the Philippines, 2,459 from India, 2,065 from Nigeria,and 2,056 from South Africa - where health authorities have expressed concern about a drain of scarce skilled staff being tempted into Britain. There is usually no guarantee that applications from overseas to join the UK register will convert into extra nurses on the wards. But the UKCC said most of the 29,119 overseas-trained applicants in 2000/01 were on \"adaptation courses\" lasting from six to nine months to prepare them for work in British hospitals. \"This means that 2001/02 will see a very large increase in overseas registrations,\" the council said. Last year the number of overseas-trained nurses reaching the register rose by 4.1% to 7,705. The influx is likely to come in the nick of time for health ministers, who saw the shortage of staff as the main obstacle to their plans to improve the NHS. Alan Milburn, the health secretary, committed the government to increase the number of nurses by 20,000 by 2004, GPs by 2,500 and consultants by 7,500. Last year ministers told NHS trusts they should not recruit nurses from developing places where they were in short sup ply, such as South Africa and the West Indies. Last month John Denham, the health minister, extended the instruction to cover employment agencies. He said they would be blacklisted by the NHS if they failed to honour a revised code of practice banning poaching from countries that were battling to raise health standards. But the government has not interfered with the freedom of movement of individual nurses coming to Britain of their own accord to seek jobs in the NHS. The number applying to get on the UK register from the Philippines - where there is a surplus of trained nurses - more than doubled from 5,643 in 1999/2000 to 13,750 in 2000/01. Over the same period applications from India nearly trebled from 880 to 2,459. Other big exporters last year included Australia with 1,330 applications and Zimbabwe with 1,201. The council also announced the first increase for seven years in numbers of \"homegrown\" nurses and midwives who came on to the register after training in Britain. The total rose by 10% to 15,433.

      "body": "<b> Transport</b> <p>Mayor Livingstone will mark today's anniversary by posing for photographers with some newly recruited Routemaster bus drivers, a symbol of one of his campaign pledges. Tube and bus fares have been frozen in real terms. There is a transport strategy and much consultation. </p> <p>But London's roads are not noticeably less congested by cars or commercial vehicles, and improvements to bus lanes and reliability are painfully slow. Its trains - tube and suburban - remain notoriously unreliable. </p> <p>Voters do not blame the mayor - not yet. For much of the year Mr Livingstone has been engaged in a very public battle with John Prescott and (behind the scenes) Gordon Brown over the financing and management of the tube's modernisation. </p> <p>Most independent experts, the City and voters side with Mr Livingstone. But the mayor's trump card has been his appointment of Bob Kiley, the smooth-talking moderniser of New York and Boston's creaking subway systems, as his transport commissioner. </p> <p>Mr Kiley's flair and expertise impresses most people (Tony Blair is yet to meet him), as does his claim that Labour's public-private partnership will replicate the worst of rail privatisation. </p> <p>Mesmerised by their fear and dislike of Mr Livingstone, ministers keep digging themselves into a deeper hole as the mayor seeks a judicial review. A compromise should be possible. Meanwhile the tube - a vital artery for 1m travellers in the biggest chunk of Britain's economy - goes from bad to worse. </p> <p>Congestion charging, the mayor's other big idea, is more or less on track for introduction at \u00a35 a day in 2003-04 inside an inner zone from Marylebone Road to the Elephant and Castle via Tower and Vauxhall bridges. The technology to make it work, a video-based monitoring system, is said to be \"better than expected\". Consultation is under way. </p> <p>The mayor wants to see new bus lanes, better contracts with the bus operators and improved key routes. There are more conductors. Taxis and minicabs are also being encouraged to provide better services at night. Free public transport for school trips has been restored. </p> <p>Mr Livingstone backs new tube and cross-rail systems to ease congestion, and one - the Paddington to Liverpool Street link - got the go-ahead yesterday. It may be working by 2010. </p> <p>The mayor's team is full of good ideas. \"But they lack a hard edge. Many come from a legislative background, not a delivery background,\" said one close observer. </p> <p><b> Verdict: </b> Still gridlocked. </p> <p> <b> Crime</b> </p> <p>Whitehall circumscribed the mayor's powers, but he and his appointees do have real power over the new Metropolitan police authority with its \u00a32bn budget. Typically of Mr Livingstone's new inclusive approach he gave Lord Harris, a veteran London politician, the chairman's job. </p> <p>His big achievement has been to use the first London budget, negotiated down by the cross-party GLA, to find the money for 1,050 extra police - though, with retirement still running high, that will mean recruiting 2,500 officers. </p> <p>The government's admission that pay and housing are a London police problem means an extra \u00a36,000 a year for recruits. Falling numbers are finally being reversed. </p> <p>Pressure to recruit ethnic officers (25% is London's target) and to improve relations with minority groups extends far beyond the mayor's office, as does the debate about stop and search. </p> <p>The mayor's anti-crime agenda addresses fear of crime, especially among women and older people on the street at night. A consultation paper is looking at ways to protect women from domestic violence. </p> <p>The mayor and the police seem determined not to fall out. Livingstone Mark II was equivocal about the tube strike, but backed the police against what his media machine called \"anarchist violence by May Day Monopoly protesters\" this week. </p> <p><b> Verdict: </b> Good ideas. </p> <p> <b> Jobs and the environment</b> </p> <p>The City is pleased with Mr Livingstone because he now backs tall office blocks. But his housing powers are limited. On Tuesday he will launch his \"spatial development strategy\". His team has plans for better air quality, a cycle network by 2004 and better recycling of rubbish - though progress so far has been disappointing. </p> <p>On the jobs front the mayor has set up a London development agency headed by Mike Ward, an old GLC ally from the 80s, but with heavy-hitting outsiders (including Judith Mayhew from the City) on board. The buoyant London economy has helped him, though the coming City shake-out looks likely to hurt the capital. </p> <p><b> Verdict: </b> So far so good. </p> <p> <b>Article archive</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/livingstone/archive/0,3332,265330,00.html\">More articles about Livingstone's London</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/\">London Mayor and Assembly: official site</a></p> <p><b>Cartoons</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/livingstone/graphic/0,5543,464131,00.html\">Martin Rowson on Ken Livingstone's election victory</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/livingstone/graphic/0,5543,485786,00.html\">Martin Rowson on Ken Livingstone's first anniversary in office</a></p> <p><b>Related special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/transport/\">Transport in Britain</a></p> <p><b>The basics</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/livingstone/article/0,2763,265362,00.html\">What are the Mayor's responsibilities?</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Transport Mayor Livingstone will mark today's anniversary by posing for photographers with some newly recruited Routemaster bus drivers, a symbol of one of his campaign pledges. Tube and bus fares have been frozen in real terms. There is a transport strategy and much consultation. But London's roads are not noticeably less congested by cars or commercial vehicles, and improvements to bus lanes and reliability are painfully slow. Its trains - tube and suburban - remain notoriously unreliable. Voters do not blame the mayor - not yet. For much of the year Mr Livingstone has been engaged in a very public battle with John Prescott and (behind the scenes) Gordon Brown over the financing and management of the tube's modernisation. Most independent experts, the City and voters side with Mr Livingstone. But the mayor's trump card has been his appointment of Bob Kiley, the smooth-talking moderniser of New York and Boston's creaking subway systems, as his transport commissioner. Mr Kiley's flair and expertise impresses most people (Tony Blair is yet to meet him), as does his claim that Labour's public-private partnership will replicate the worst of rail privatisation. Mesmerised by their fear and dislike of Mr Livingstone, ministers keep digging themselves into a deeper hole as the mayor seeks a judicial review. A compromise should be possible. Meanwhile the tube - a vital artery for 1m travellers in the biggest chunk of Britain's economy - goes from bad to worse. Congestion charging, the mayor's other big idea, is more or less on track for introduction at \u00a35 a day in 2003-04 inside an inner zone from Marylebone Road to the Elephant and Castle via Tower and Vauxhall bridges. The technology to make it work, a video-based monitoring system, is said to be \"better than expected\". Consultation is under way. The mayor wants to see new bus lanes, better contracts with the bus operators and improved key routes. There are more conductors. Taxis and minicabs are also being encouraged to provide better services at night. Free public transport for school trips has been restored. Mr Livingstone backs new tube and cross-rail systems to ease congestion, and one - the Paddington to Liverpool Street link - got the go-ahead yesterday. It may be working by 2010. The mayor's team is full of good ideas. \"But they lack a hard edge. Many come from a legislative background, not a delivery background,\" said one close observer. Verdict: Still gridlocked. Crime Whitehall circumscribed the mayor's powers, but he and his appointees do have real power over the new Metropolitan police authority with its \u00a32bn budget. Typically of Mr Livingstone's new inclusive approach he gave Lord Harris, a veteran London politician, the chairman's job. His big achievement has been to use the first London budget, negotiated down by the cross-party GLA, to find the money for 1,050 extra police - though, with retirement still running high, that will mean recruiting 2,500 officers. The government's admission that pay and housing are a London police problem means an extra \u00a36,000 a year for recruits. Falling numbers are finally being reversed. Pressure to recruit ethnic officers (25% is London's target) and to improve relations with minority groups extends far beyond the mayor's office, as does the debate about stop and search. The mayor's anti-crime agenda addresses fear of crime, especially among women and older people on the street at night. A consultation paper is looking at ways to protect women from domestic violence. The mayor and the police seem determined not to fall out. Livingstone Mark II was equivocal about the tube strike, but backed the police against what his media machine called \"anarchist violence by May Day Monopoly protesters\" this week. Verdict: Good ideas. Jobs and the environment The City is pleased with Mr Livingstone because he now backs tall office blocks. But his housing powers are limited. On Tuesday he will launch his \"spatial development strategy\". His team has plans for better air quality, a cycle network by 2004 and better recycling of rubbish - though progress so far has been disappointing. On the jobs front the mayor has set up a London development agency headed by Mike Ward, an old GLC ally from the 80s, but with heavy-hitting outsiders (including Judith Mayhew from the City) on board. The buoyant London economy has helped him, though the coming City shake-out looks likely to hurt the capital. Verdict: So far so good.

Of those, 79 had not been for regular smears, and in 122 cases there had been an error in the way the screeners had reported the slide results. In 44 of the 122, there had been no adverse consequences - the cancer had been diagnosed soon afterwards. But the other 78 suffered a worsening of their condition before it was diagnosed, and 14 died. The Imperial Cancer Research Fund and the Cancer Research Campaign urged women to continue to go for screening. \"Though cervical screening may not be perfect, it is preventing many thousands of cancers,\" said Dr Peter Sasieni of the ICRF.",

      "bodyText": "Citizens won the right to unprecedented access to EU documents yesterday after the European parliament ended years of argument by ratifying new rules on openness. MEPs voted by a resounding 400 to 85 to back a bitterly fought - and still controversial - compromise between the union's 15 governments, the supranational European commission, and the parliament. The rules are now legally binding on EU institutions. The British government, which had campaigned for greater access, gave its blessing: \"This is a real step forward in making the EU more open and accountable,\" a spokesman said. It was a well deserved victory for the current holder of the EU's rotating presidency, Sweden, with its strong tradition of transparency, and a defeat for secretive France and Germany, which had resisted change. \"It creates a new right for the citizens of Europe,\" said a delighted Britta Lejon, the Swedish minister for democratic issues. \"Citizens have a right confirmed by treaty to access these documents.\" Freedom of information lobbyists complained that the agreement contained too many exemptions and should not have been negotiated behind closed doors. \"The call from civil society for an open, accountable and democratic Europe may have been ignored on this occasion but its case is stands unanswerered,\" said Tony Bunyan, of the London-based civil liberties group Statewatch. The European Federation of Journalists also opposed the measure in its present form. In Brussels, the sheer complexity of issues is usually a bigger problem than secrecy, but even so, the agreement should usher in real change. On this issue, said a commission insider, \"the French and their cronies have been fighting a losing battle\". EU citizens were promised greater transparency in the 1997 Amsterdam treaty as a reaction to mounting popular frustration at opaque government and bureaucracy, especially in the policy-making council of ministers, where governments cooperate. In 1995, the Guardian correspondent John Carvel spurred the process when he successfully sued the council in the European Court of Justice for breaking its own rules on access. The new rules cover all categories of documents, including foreign policy and defence documents - a sensitive point as the EU seeks to reassure Nato that its new defence initiative will not compromise jealously guarded alliance secrets. Under the rules, the institutions can block the release of documents if they are judged to violate secrecy rules, based on the principle that release could be \"harmful\". Secrecy can be invoked only to protect commercial interests, cases before a court or, more controversially, \"to protect internal working material\". Documents can be kept secret for a maximum of 30 years. If a document is only partly covered by a restriction, the rest of it must be released. Requests must be answered within 15 working days - faster than before. An appeal can be made to the EU ombudsman or the European court of justice if a request is refused. Non-EU citizens have the same rights regarding requests. Heidi Hautala, leader of the Greens, who opposed the deal, said: \"Members did not seize the opportunity to fill in the loopholes in the compromise, which still allow for considerable restrictions\" by classifying documents as sensitive. In general, all EU papers are to be entered into a register, including defence documents unless - a potentially significant catch - the register information is itself classified secret. All institutions must report annually to parliament. Even so, \"This is the beginning of a new era of openness and transparency in the EU,\" said Michael Cashman, the British Labour MEP who launched the legislation. \"This code turns a spotlight on Europe's institutions and opens them up to public scrutiny.\"",

He made enough positive noises in five hours of negotiations with the EU team to offset the gloom caused by the tougher stance towards Pyongyang recently taken by the US president, George Bush. According to the Swedish prime minister, Goran Persson, Mr Kim reaffirmed his intention to take part in a return North-South summit in Seoul, which was meant to take place in March but has been delayed. He did not suggest a new date for the summit. In keeping with his \"pro-active\" diplomacy first demonstrated at the North-South summit in Pyongyang last year, Mr Kim spent the morning in\"frank and friendly\", discussions which continued at a lunch banquet. Wearing his characteristic beige jump-suit, he clinked huge glasses of French red wine with Mr Persson with characteristic gusto. Mr Kim made it clear that the delay in the summit had been caused by unhappiness at the Bush administration's dislike of the dialogue started by Mr Clinton with Pyongyang. It was not, he said, due to any cooling of relations with Seoul. Pyongyang is eager to take part in the summit, Mr Persson said, but is wary of the timing because the US is reviewing its policy. EU officials were also pleased by the restatement of the 2003 missile moratorium date for the first time since Mr Bush took office; the US president's decision on missile defence earlier this week leans heavily on the alleged threat from North Korea and other \"states of concern\". Mr Persson was given an oral message from Mr Kim to Mr Bush which he said shows \"a willingness to continue the dialogue\" with the US, but he warned that not too much should be read into it. Entering new ground, the EU commissioner for external relations, Chris Patten, persuaded Mr Kim to agree to discussions on opening a dialogue on human rights with the EU. But there was no response to the suggestion that Pyongyang should accept a visit by the UN special rapporteur on human rights. \"This is going to be a long process,\" Mr Patten said. \"But the important thing is to start the journey.\" With North Korea still an almost completely closed society, any move to allow on-the-spot inquiries into human rights abuses seems very remote.

All but one of the EU's members already recognise North Korea or are in the process of doing so: an EU decision on its recognition is expected to be a formality. However, officials in Pyongyang appear in no doubt that in the end it is the US which carries the most political and economic weight, and the EU mission has been at pains to deny that it is mediating between the two.

Newsreader Peter Sissons and the BBC's director general, Greg Dyke, have admitted the channel will not see the real \"magic\" in programming until the autumn. Mr Baker, who will become world news editor after the expected June general election, said he expected the BBC's controversial switch to the 10pm slot to be vindicated as soon as the corporation's strategy \"comes good.\" A BBC spokesman said the new BBC1 programme schedule under the channel's controller, Lorraine Heggessey, will boost the bulletin's viewing figures. \"We assume that when the schedule strengthens, it will have a positive result for the bulletin,\" he said. The 9pm window is seen as a key factor in the BBC's ongoing battle with ITV over the 10pm news slot, which the independent network is currently winning. The BBC bulletin has averaged 5.1m viewers from its debut in October last year, while ITV has averaged 6m with its News at Ten programme. However, the BBC has shown signs of improvement in the all-important 9pm slot, with its audience share rising from 23.7% to 26.3% over the past 12 months. But the good news has been tempered by the end of big hits such as One Foot in the Grave and the Royle Family, and ITV has seen its dominance of the slot increase to a 35% share.",

      "body": "<p>Londoners with a taste for drama may feel a tad disappointed. After all, did not the prime minister and half the cabinet warn that victory for Ken Livingstone would be a \"disaster for London\"? Did they not predict a cataclysmic return to the dark days of the 80s? Yet what has happened? Mr Livingstone's first year in office, which he marks today, has not been one of chaos and civic breakdown - but an almost anticlimactic period of quiet. The mayor has arrived and the sky has not fallen in; things have carried on much as they were.</p> <p>For some this is a let-down. They liked the Ken of old, with his knack for controversy and attention-grabbing stunts. They find it hard to get used to a once Red Ken who works to get more money for the police and supports their clampdown on this week's May Day protests. But the mayor himself, as he explains in the interview we publish today, sees all this as vindication.

      "bodyText": "Londoners with a taste for drama may feel a tad disappointed. After all, did not the prime minister and half the cabinet warn that victory for Ken Livingstone would be a \"disaster for London\"? Did they not predict a cataclysmic return to the dark days of the 80s? Yet what has happened? Mr Livingstone's first year in office, which he marks today, has not been one of chaos and civic breakdown - but an almost anticlimactic period of quiet. The mayor has arrived and the sky has not fallen in; things have carried on much as they were. For some this is a let-down. They liked the Ken of old, with his knack for controversy and attention-grabbing stunts. They find it hard to get used to a once Red Ken who works to get more money for the police and supports their clampdown on this week's May Day protests. But the mayor himself, as he explains in the interview we publish today, sees all this as vindication. He is grateful for the verdict of LSE local government expert, Tony Travers, who declares the first few months of the Greater London assembly \"a miracle of competent administration\". If Londoners are finding things quiet, that is fine by him. His first objective was to prove Mr Blair wrong - to get the new, devolved machinery up and running and to show that a Livingstone mayoralty was no \"disaster\". Beyond that, what is the record?

      "body": "<p>Ted Rogers, who has died after prolonged heart trouble at the age of 65, was one of the personable but anonymous brand of British comedians who, from the 1960s, replaced genial and genuine oddities like the bumbling Rob Wilton, the flamboyant Max Miller and the chirpily tiny Arthur Askey. </p> <p>He drew audiences of 17m as the host of the Yorkshire Television game show 3-2-1, in which, from 1978, his trademark was saying \"Time's up\" to his contestants while counting down on his fingers. Ironically, in 1965, after the BBC had given him his own show, And So To Ted, it was dropped after six weeks because it failed to find large enough audiences. </p> <p>This was perhaps revealing. Rogers did best when playing the host, or attaching himself to stars with a powerful personal or group identity, such as on Bachelors' Night Out, the ITV series in which, from 1965, he presented the pop group, the Bachelors. </p> <p>Likewise, his attachment to the Conservative Party in general, and to Mrs Thatcher in particular, ensured that, at one stage, he was virtually court jester at 10 Downing Street. </p> <p>On the night of her first election victory, over James Callaghan, in 1979, he quipped: \"We shall know in the morning if we have a silly old woman as prime minister, or whether Margaret Thatcher got in.\" He once told her that in one room she still had the same wallpaper that his mother had had for years in her bathroom. </p> <p>At this point, Rogers was making \u00a3130,000 a year. But his life was subject to heights and troughs of fortune. </p> <p>He was born in Kennington, south London, and at the age of 12, was inspired towards a show business career by a Danny Kaye comedy film. At 16, he won a holiday camp contest with his Danny Kaye impressions, but further progress was impeded by national service in the RAF, which he completed in 1950. </p> <p>While working as a clerk, he looked for show business jobs, eventually becoming a Butlin's red coat, and graduating into pantomime. He appeared in Cinderella at the London Coliseum after the star of the show, Tommy Steele, hurt his ankle. </p> <p>In 1960, Rogers was asked to comp\u00e8re the Prince of Wales' Show, and, three years later, began an association with radio's The Billy Cotton Band Show. As comp\u00e8re of the ITV show, Sunday Night At The London Palladium, from 1974, he was in his element as anchorman to other people's talents. </p> <p>The same applied when he began presenting 3-2-1, where he vied for popularity with the animated Dusty Bin, into which wrong answers were placed. The show was dropped after 10 years, and when Yorkshire TV mooted its return in 1996, they took the view that Rogers would no longer be right - \"something of a has-dusty bin,\" said one executive unkindly. </p> <p>In the intervening years, Rogers's career had plummeted. At his peak, he had a large house, five polo ponies, a Rolls-Royce and 12 Mercedes. He launched a production company, which collapsed with debts of \u00a350,000 - to his credit, Rogers ruled out evading the debts by making him self bankrupt, and all debtors were paid. He moved into a smaller rented house, and then a cottage. His last Mercedes was repossessed while he was signing autographs for fans. </p> <p>But he soldiered on. Even in the depths of financial depression, he insisted on treating all the staff to buns and cakes every time he visited the offices of his agent Phil Dale, who found him \"an absolute gentleman\". To the last, he also gave the once-traditional presents to everyone appearing with him on a show. </p> <p>Rogers was still working almost to the time of his death, principally in pantomimes and on ocean cruises, and was expecting to go to the United States next Christmas to play in a show called Vaudeville with his friend, the comedian Jackie Mason. He may not have had overwhelming individuality, but he was a professional slogger who deserved better than fashion and his misjudgments decreed. </p> <p>Rogers is survived by his wife Marion, and their son and daughter, and by two daughters from his first marriage. </p> <p>\u0095 Ted Rogers, comedian and presenter, born July 20 1935; died May 2 2001</p>",

Ironically, in 1965, after the BBC had given him his own show, And So To Ted, it was dropped after six weeks because it failed to find large enough audiences. This was perhaps revealing. Rogers did best when playing the host, or attaching himself to stars with a powerful personal or group identity, such as on Bachelors' Night Out, the ITV series in which, from 1965, he presented the pop group, the Bachelors. Likewise, his attachment to the Conservative Party in general, and to Mrs Thatcher in particular, ensured that, at one stage, he was virtually court jester at 10 Downing Street. On the night of her first election victory, over James Callaghan, in 1979, he quipped: \"We shall know in the morning if we have a silly old woman as prime minister, or whether Margaret Thatcher got in.\" He once told her that in one room she still had the same wallpaper that his mother had had for years in her bathroom. At this point, Rogers was making \u00a3130,000 a year. But his life was subject to heights and troughs of fortune. He was born in Kennington, south London, and at the age of 12, was inspired towards a show business career by a Danny Kaye comedy film. At 16, he won a holiday camp contest with his Danny Kaye impressions, but further progress was impeded by national service in the RAF, which he completed in 1950. While working as a clerk, he looked for show business jobs, eventually becoming a Butlin's red coat, and graduating into pantomime. He appeared in Cinderella at the London Coliseum after the star of the show, Tommy Steele, hurt his ankle. In 1960, Rogers was asked to comp\u00e8re the Prince of Wales' Show, and, three years later, began an association with radio's The Billy Cotton Band Show. As comp\u00e8re of the ITV show, Sunday Night At The London Palladium, from 1974, he was in his element as anchorman to other people's talents. The same applied when he began presenting 3-2-1, where he vied for popularity with the animated Dusty Bin, into which wrong answers were placed. The show was dropped after 10 years, and when Yorkshire TV mooted its return in 1996, they took the view that Rogers would no longer be right - \"something of a has-dusty bin,\" said one executive unkindly. In the intervening years, Rogers's career had plummeted. At his peak, he had a large house, five polo ponies, a Rolls-Royce and 12 Mercedes. He launched a production company, which collapsed with debts of \u00a350,000 - to his credit, Rogers ruled out evading the debts by making him self bankrupt, and all debtors were paid. He moved into a smaller rented house, and then a cottage. His last Mercedes was repossessed while he was signing autographs for fans. But he soldiered on. Even in the depths of financial depression, he insisted on treating all the staff to buns and cakes every time he visited the offices of his agent Phil Dale, who found him \"an absolute gentleman\". To the last, he also gave the once-traditional presents to everyone appearing with him on a show. Rogers was still working almost to the time of his death, principally in pantomimes and on ocean cruises, and was expecting to go to the United States next Christmas to play in a show called Vaudeville with his friend, the comedian Jackie Mason. He may not have had overwhelming individuality, but he was a professional slogger who deserved better than fashion and his misjudgments decreed. Rogers is survived by his wife Marion, and their son and daughter, and by two daughters from his first marriage. \u0095 Ted Rogers, comedian and presenter, born July 20 1935; died May 2 2001",

But speaking last year to South Korean journalists, Mr Kim said he had travelled abroad many times, presumably incognito. If this is so, his son might have been attempting to see Japan in the same way. The justice ministry plans to expel the man to China within a couple of days. If his identity is confirmed as Kim, the case would have to be handled with great sensitivity, given the status of their captive and the tense relations between Japan and its reclusive neighbour. In North Korea, Kim Jong-nam was nicknamed \"the Little General\" as a child. Two years ago, South Korean media reported that he had entered the north's intelligence services as a first step towards inheriting his father's and his grandfather's position. Mr Kim's role as heir apparent to Kim Il-sung was an official secret for many years: his name was not mentioned publicly, even though his birthday was celebrated by officials. Mr Kim is said to have three children by different mothers, though there is no way of verifying reports about Mr Kim's family, including lurid tales about his alleged affairs. After the north-south rapprochement last year, many experts came to believe that such stories had been largely concocted by South Korean black propaganda. Japan's prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, reportedly held an emergency meeting with senior foreign ministry officials to discuss the first big diplomatic test of his week-old administration. Kim Jong-nam is believed to have been educated in Geneva and, secretly, in Japan. He speaks French and Japanese and is reportedly a computer enthusiast. Most of his life has been spent overseas, including a spell in Russia. According to his adopted sister, Lee Nam-ok, Kim Jong-nam is bespectacled and portly and looks like his father. \"He has a good mind and sense of humour. He is very energetic. He is a permanent optimist and a pleasant young man who can laugh all day long from morning to evening. He also has an artistic sense like his father,\" she said in an interview.",

Five gangland bosses were killed as rivals exploded bombs in homes and cars, with little regard for innocent bystanders. The police were also accused of incompetency and corruption. Now they believe that most of the crime bosses are either dead or in prison. A bill to counter organised crime and terrorism is expected to become law by the end of the month.",

Similarly, we may think that travelling people who poo in fields are weird and unsanitary, but to some, went the logic, having a room in your house dedicated to the evacuation of one's bowels - the same room in which you perform your ablutions - is equally foul and strange. It is all down to cultural norms, apparently. </p> <p>Well I didn't believe it then and I don't believe it now.

As <strong> A Life Of Grime Special</strong> (BBC1) showed, he lives in 10 sq ft of a five-bedroom Victorian villa in north London.

The garden too is strewn with all sorts of garbage from old window panes to geriatric fridges filled with broken biscuits. The place looks like a theme park designed by Stig of the Dump. </p> <p>Not that Mr Trebus calls it rubbish, or even matter out of place. The bags and fridges and window panes are his personal belongings and he is engaged in a fight with his local council to keep them in the place they're in at the moment. The council has already cleared his garden once, a story detailed in the original A Life Of Grime series, but now the garden is back to its manky state and the council have been called in again. Mike Cording from the council's environmental health department - henceforth referred to as Exasperated Mike - has been charged with dealing with Mr Trebus, which isn't an easy task, given that the old man's response to papers from the magistrates' court is \"stick it up your chuffer\". </p> <p>I'm not really sure what the point of A Life Of Grime Special is. With John Peel narrating in his aren't-we-Brits-eccentric, Home-Truths tones, I think we were supposed to empathise with Mr Trebus. A survivor of the German occupation of Poland, he was an old soldier who was being hassled by local government to conform. \"I'm sorry I am still alive\", he wailed before warning Exasperated Mike that he didn't know what it was like fighting a war, and \"even the blooming Dad's Army wouldn't let you in.\" In some respects, he was quite admirable - the way he got a building firm to repair his house on the (unfulfillable) promise they could then convert it into flats, for example. But then again, he was a dirty old man who, despite passing a psychiatric test as to his sanity, was clearly \"unusual\". I mean, he lives in a house with hundreds of plastic bags filled with junk and doesn't even know where his telly is. That is not normal or even mildly eccentric. </p> <p>Cultural relativity be damned, it is out there with David Icke. And it is very, very unhygenic. </p> <p>In fact, it was quite an unrewarding documentary to watch. The old man's children were mentioned in passing, which raised the question of their non-involvement, yet this question wasn't answered. Rather than examining his state of mind and whether people in his situation should be hosed down with Dettol for their own benefit, we were instead treated to what was, at best, a celebration of irresponsibility and at worst, no more than an exploitative freak show. </p> <p>The kind of man who gives elderly folks a bad name with his \"I fought in a war\" nonsense, Mr Trebus didn't even need a couple of pet pythons to become the archetypal weird old bloke whose house neighbourhood children throw stones at.

Lesley Molseed, of Rochdale, Greater Manchester, was stabbed 12 times and then sexually assaulted in 1975. Her body was dumped on the moors above Ripponden in West Yorkshire. The brutal killing outraged local people. In December 1975, detectives arrested and charged Stefan Kiszko, a tax clerk from Rochdale who had never been in trouble with the law. After two days of questioning he signed a confession. He later complained that the confession had been bullied out of him but was convicted of murder and jailed for life. Fourteen years later his lawyer urged the Home Office to reopen the case, which was then referred back to West Yorkshire police. New inquiries showed that semen found on Lesley's body contained heads of sperm. Mr Kiszko, however, was infertile. He was freed in 1992 but died a year later. His mother Charlotte, who had campaigned tirelessly to prove his innocence, died six months after him.

      "bodyText": "Chinese officials failed yesterday to allow visiting American technicians to power up the damaged US spy plane stranded in southern China. A civilian technical team from the Lockheed Martin corporation spent a second day examining the plane, which remains on Hainan island where it landed on April 1. People's Liberation Army officials unexpectedly failed to provide the technical support requested by the Americans which would have allowed it to start the engines and check systems, the Pentagon said. The US team spent four hours on the plane on Wednesday, and was meant to carry out further inspections yesterday, the Pentagon official said. The team plans to make a further visit today. Beijing did not explain why the requested support was not provided, the Pentagon said. The latest hitch sparked speculation in Washington that the lack of help might be a response to Wednesday's confused efforts by the Pentagon to downgrade military cooperation with China. The incident also coincided with Beijing's first official response to President George Bush's announcement on Tuesday that he intends to press ahead with a missile defence system. After 36 hours of silence, a Chinese spokesman denounced the move yesterday as opening the way to a new international arms race. The Pentagon chilled an already cooling relationship ties with China on Wednesday by saying that it was suspending all military links with Beijing. A few hours later, the Bush administration retracted the statement, saying contacts were now being reviewed by the defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, \"on a case-by-case basis\". Admiral Craig Quigley, a Pentagon spokesman, said that the earlier announcement, written by a Rumsfeld aide, had been \"an honest misrepresentation\" of his boss's intentions. The uncharacteristic confusion suggests underlying tensions between the diplomatic approach by the White House and a more confrontational mood in the Pentagon, under the hardline Mr Rumsfeld. Beijing called Mr Bush's missile defence plan an attempt by the president to act tough to divert attention from his disputed election victory. \"Bush is trying to eradicate from his own mind the shadow of being a 'weak president',\" said the People's Daily. The criticism came as Chinese officials urged Washington not to scrap the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty which limits missile defences.",

      "body": "<p>ScottishPower, Britain's largest electrical utility, yesterday brushed aside US power and other problems and claimed that it was making considerable progress in reducing its exposure to shortages on the west coast of America. </p> <p>Its US business incurred extra costs of almost \u00a3300m in the year to March, \u00a390m of which were caused by the breaking down of its Hunter generator plant in Utah. The 160-day closure forced the company to buy in power from other generators - at a time when prices were high. </p> <p>ScottishPower said that the Hunter plant was now repaired and had been supplying customers since last weekend. The company plans to increase its generation capacity by 1,000MW, or 10%, in this financial year. A new plant in Gadsby, Salt Lake City, was the first to begin generation this week, while five more are in construction. </p> <p>The company said its profits would continue to be significantly hit by power shortages in the US for the next two months, but increased generation capacity would reduce exposure by September. </p> <p>For the year to March 2001, it posted underlying pre-tax profits of \u00a3628m, down from \u00a3736m the previous year and in line with analysts' forecasts. However, the City greeted news of a planned restructuring warmly, with shares in ScottishPower closing 6.5p higher at 448p. </p> <p>A spokesman said that the utility firm was confident of recovering \"most, though not all\" of the \u00a3300m costs incurred during the US power shortage through increased charges to customers. </p> <p>The proposed increases are subject to court proceedings, though most analysts consider ScottishPower to have a strong case. </p> <p>Ian Russell, who took over as chief executive in March, said the balance between company's power generation and supply divisions had been \"out of kilter\", and added that in creased generation in the US was helping to redress that balance. </p> <p>ScottishPower is thought also to be considering acquiring US firm Enron's Portland plant quoted at around $3bn. </p> <p>\"When we acquired PacifiCorp [Scottish Power's US business] we said it was a platform for further growth,\" Mr Russell said. </p> <p>\"Obviously Portland is right in our own back yard.\" </p> <p>An acquisition could be funded by the proposed sale of its water business, Southern Water, which has proved ex pensive since the introduction of extra regulatory requirements. The company said it had received several expressions of interest for the business. </p> <p>ScottishPower's acquisition of Southern Water formed part of its disastrous attempt to establish the company as a multi-utility provider - supplying customers not only with power, but with water, financial services (through a joint venture with Royal Bank of Scotland) and telecoms (through its partly spun-off business Thus). </p> <p>Yesterday Mr Russell, who had backed these ambitious plans during his eight years at ScottishPower, outlined a more modest vision for the future. </p> <p>\"You have to limit what you take on,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Right now we are focusing on improving the businesses that we have got.\" </p> <p>The now aborted plans to diversify across a host of utility services contributed to the loss of 200,000 customers in the UK last year in ScottishPower's core business. The figure has since stabilised at 3.5m. </p> <p>\u0095 Powergen, the British utility that has agreed to a takeover by German power giant E.ON, yesterday said that its pre-tax profits for the first three months had fallen to \u00a3200m, compared with \u00a3233m the previous year. </p> <p>Turnover was up 49% thanks to expanding UK business and a three months contribution from its US acquisition LG&amp;E, though regulatory price caps in Britain had held back earnings.</p>",

      "bodyText": "ScottishPower, Britain's largest electrical utility, yesterday brushed aside US power and other problems and claimed that it was making considerable progress in reducing its exposure to shortages on the west coast of America. Its US business incurred extra costs of almost \u00a3300m in the year to March, \u00a390m of which were caused by the breaking down of its Hunter generator plant in Utah. The 160-day closure forced the company to buy in power from other generators - at a time when prices were high. ScottishPower said that the Hunter plant was now repaired and had been supplying customers since last weekend. The company plans to increase its generation capacity by 1,000MW, or 10%, in this financial year. A new plant in Gadsby, Salt Lake City, was the first to begin generation this week, while five more are in construction. The company said its profits would continue to be significantly hit by power shortages in the US for the next two months, but increased generation capacity would reduce exposure by September. For the year to March 2001, it posted underlying pre-tax profits of \u00a3628m, down from \u00a3736m the previous year and in line with analysts' forecasts. However, the City greeted news of a planned restructuring warmly, with shares in ScottishPower closing 6.5p higher at 448p. A spokesman said that the utility firm was confident of recovering \"most, though not all\" of the \u00a3300m costs incurred during the US power shortage through increased charges to customers. The proposed increases are subject to court proceedings, though most analysts consider ScottishPower to have a strong case. Ian Russell, who took over as chief executive in March, said the balance between company's power generation and supply divisions had been \"out of kilter\", and added that in creased generation in the US was helping to redress that balance. ScottishPower is thought also to be considering acquiring US firm Enron's Portland plant quoted at around $3bn. \"When we acquired PacifiCorp [Scottish Power's US business] we said it was a platform for further growth,\" Mr Russell said. \"Obviously Portland is right in our own back yard.\" An acquisition could be funded by the proposed sale of its water business, Southern Water, which has proved ex pensive since the introduction of extra regulatory requirements. The company said it had received several expressions of interest for the business. ScottishPower's acquisition of Southern Water formed part of its disastrous attempt to establish the company as a multi-utility provider - supplying customers not only with power, but with water, financial services (through a joint venture with Royal Bank of Scotland) and telecoms (through its partly spun-off business Thus). Yesterday Mr Russell, who had backed these ambitious plans during his eight years at ScottishPower, outlined a more modest vision for the future. \"You have to limit what you take on,\" he said. \"Right now we are focusing on improving the businesses that we have got.\" The now aborted plans to diversify across a host of utility services contributed to the loss of 200,000 customers in the UK last year in ScottishPower's core business. The figure has since stabilised at 3.5m. \u0095 Powergen, the British utility that has agreed to a takeover by German power giant E.ON, yesterday said that its pre-tax profits for the first three months had fallen to \u00a3200m, compared with \u00a3233m the previous year. Turnover was up 49% thanks to expanding UK business and a three months contribution from its US acquisition LG&amp;E, though regulatory price caps in Britain had held back earnings.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>Steel workers pay price of flexibility</strong><br></p> <p>The days of them and us were supposed to be over. Partnership was the buzz word in union and management circles. Last night, however, the new chumminess took a back seat to a renewed bout of old-fashioned class warfare. </p> <p>The issue was lay-offs. As steel maker Corus slammed its doors in the face of a last-ditch rescue attempt, the CBI and TUC came to blows over whether Britain was more vulnerable to plant closures because of its easy hire and fire rules. </p> <p>Digby Jones, the CBI's director general, says the \"easy come, easy go\" story about the British labour market is a myth. Companies make decisions to shut plants because of long-term concerns about profitability - not because of considerations about one-off redundancy costs. </p> <p>There is a grain of truth in Mr Jones's argument: there is no doubt that many of the jobs lost in Britain in the past year were the result of global factors, not local conditions. World oversupply in the steel industry is the chief reason why 6,000 Corus workers are out of a job. </p> <p>But the unions are right to ask why - when there is a global problem - the axe so often falls on British plants rather than European ones. Motorola is only the most recent example of a firm which had a choice between a European and British closure and chose the latter. </p> <p>At the margin, when firms know they have to close a plant somewhere, they are bound to be motivated by local fac tors such as hire and fire rules. Britain's comparatively lightly regulated labour market has proved good at creating jobs. When times are tough, however, the downside of labour-market flexibility becomes more apparent. </p> <p><strong>Rail delay</strong><br> </p> <p>It is now knocking on for six months since Britain's biggest corporate disaster area - Railtrack - started casting around for a new chairman. </p> <p>There have now been more names linked with this executive position than models with Mick Jagger and there is still no sign that the embattled rail network company has any chance of attracting anything like the calibre of industrialist they had hoped for. There is a power vacuum at the top, although cynics might say there has been ever since Sir Philip \"the invisible man\" Beck took command two years ago. The list of people considered, approached and offered the \"job from hell\" reads like a who's who of British business. </p> <p>The Railtrack headhunters and non-executives are said to have considered almost all the utility bosses. Ed Wallis of Powergen is understood to have turned it down. Ross Sayer of Innogy - who had a handy background in New Zealand Railways - was another alleged candidate, as was David Varney, the bulldog-like former boss of BG who is said to regard a bit of post-retirement chilling out as infinitely more appealing than mortal combat on behalf of the rail combine. </p> <p>The nearest Railtrack has come to finding its man was with Sir John Parker of Lattice. He is understood to have virtually had his pen poised over the contract before a family illness made him think again. Now the names doing the rounds are John Armitt, the outgoing chief executive of the construction group Costain, and Sir Malcolm Field of the Civil Aviation Authority, although the Railtrack selection board is also now looking to the continent for a candidate - particularly at the men who run the German Bundesbahn and France's SNCF. They should be so lucky. </p> <p>What they want is a candidate who can attract investment, operate in a commercial environment and has some understanding of working within a regulated business. </p> <p>They also need a bruiser who can handle the grim possibility of corporate manslaughter charges and hang tough with the government, which, although it does not own a 51% stake, certainly acts as if it does. They will also need a giant ego, confidence in dealing with ministers and mandarins and an ability to trot out reassuring, macho sound bites. </p> <p>The answer is simple. They need a politician. Step forward Steven Norris, Michael Heseltine or Kenneth Clarke. </p> <p><strong>PR coup </strong><br> </p> <p>Taking of career moves: James Rubin, the assistant secretary of state for public affairs in the Clinton administration and best known as the mouthpiece for Madeleine Albright, is joining Brunswick, the City's biggest public relations outfit, next week as a partner. </p> <p>This is a real coup for Alan Parker, Brunswick's founder, and underlines his determination to develop his PR business internationally. </p> <p>Rubin's job, we assume, will largely be confined to the cocktail party circuit, along with his famous wife, the CNN war reporter Christiane Amanpour. But, hopefully, he will find some time to deal with the odd problematic Brunswick client - such as Railtrack.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Steel workers pay price of flexibility The days of them and us were supposed to be over. Partnership was the buzz word in union and management circles. Last night, however, the new chumminess took a back seat to a renewed bout of old-fashioned class warfare. The issue was lay-offs. As steel maker Corus slammed its doors in the face of a last-ditch rescue attempt, the CBI and TUC came to blows over whether Britain was more vulnerable to plant closures because of its easy hire and fire rules. Digby Jones, the CBI's director general, says the \"easy come, easy go\" story about the British labour market is a myth. Companies make decisions to shut plants because of long-term concerns about profitability - not because of considerations about one-off redundancy costs. There is a grain of truth in Mr Jones's argument: there is no doubt that many of the jobs lost in Britain in the past year were the result of global factors, not local conditions. World oversupply in the steel industry is the chief reason why 6,000 Corus workers are out of a job. But the unions are right to ask why - when there is a global problem - the axe so often falls on British plants rather than European ones. Motorola is only the most recent example of a firm which had a choice between a European and British closure and chose the latter. At the margin, when firms know they have to close a plant somewhere, they are bound to be motivated by local fac tors such as hire and fire rules. Britain's comparatively lightly regulated labour market has proved good at creating jobs. When times are tough, however, the downside of labour-market flexibility becomes more apparent. Rail delay It is now knocking on for six months since Britain's biggest corporate disaster area - Railtrack - started casting around for a new chairman. There have now been more names linked with this executive position than models with Mick Jagger and there is still no sign that the embattled rail network company has any chance of attracting anything like the calibre of industrialist they had hoped for. There is a power vacuum at the top, although cynics might say there has been ever since Sir Philip \"the invisible man\" Beck took command two years ago. The list of people considered, approached and offered the \"job from hell\" reads like a who's who of British business. The Railtrack headhunters and non-executives are said to have considered almost all the utility bosses. Ed Wallis of Powergen is understood to have turned it down. Ross Sayer of Innogy - who had a handy background in New Zealand Railways - was another alleged candidate, as was David Varney, the bulldog-like former boss of BG who is said to regard a bit of post-retirement chilling out as infinitely more appealing than mortal combat on behalf of the rail combine. The nearest Railtrack has come to finding its man was with Sir John Parker of Lattice. He is understood to have virtually had his pen poised over the contract before a family illness made him think again. Now the names doing the rounds are John Armitt, the outgoing chief executive of the construction group Costain, and Sir Malcolm Field of the Civil Aviation Authority, although the Railtrack selection board is also now looking to the continent for a candidate - particularly at the men who run the German Bundesbahn and France's SNCF. They should be so lucky. What they want is a candidate who can attract investment, operate in a commercial environment and has some understanding of working within a regulated business. They also need a bruiser who can handle the grim possibility of corporate manslaughter charges and hang tough with the government, which, although it does not own a 51% stake, certainly acts as if it does. They will also need a giant ego, confidence in dealing with ministers and mandarins and an ability to trot out reassuring, macho sound bites. The answer is simple. They need a politician. Step forward Steven Norris, Michael Heseltine or Kenneth Clarke. PR coup Taking of career moves: James Rubin, the assistant secretary of state for public affairs in the Clinton administration and best known as the mouthpiece for Madeleine Albright, is joining Brunswick, the City's biggest public relations outfit, next week as a partner. This is a real coup for Alan Parker, Brunswick's founder, and underlines his determination to develop his PR business internationally. Rubin's job, we assume, will largely be confined to the cocktail party circuit, along with his famous wife, the CNN war reporter Christiane Amanpour. But, hopefully, he will find some time to deal with the odd problematic Brunswick client - such as Railtrack.",

Kidman, 33, says that she does not know why her husband decided three months ago to end their 10-year marriage. The couple have two adopted children, eight-year-old Isabelle and Conor, six. \"While Cruise thoroughly respects others' right to follow their own sexual preference, he is not a homosexual, had no relationship of any kind with Kyle Bradford, and does not even know him,\" says the lawsuit. The claim could damage Cruise's career, the lawsuit says, because fans might boycott his movies \"particularly since he tends to play parts calling for heterosexual romance and action/adventure\". The magazine, which carried the porn actor's claim that Kidman walked in on an encounter he had with Cruise, has agreed to publish a retraction, said Bert Fields, a lawyer for the Hollywood star, who has been nominated three times for an Oscar. Slater told Actustar that they met when Cruise called him out of the blue, using the assumed name of Tom Finigham, and requested a bout in a wrestling ring: the ring was rented and the two became intimate later. Other stars have gone to some lengths to assert their heterosexuality. Richard Gere placed an advertisement in The Times 10 years ago to say that he and his then wife, Cindy Crawford, \"remain very married\" - they split soon after - and Jason Donovan sued The Face when it claimed that he was gay. Slater's story has disrupted the choreography of the Cruise-Kidman split. Dominic Barbara, a New York divorce lawyer, said: \"Right after the divorce announcement there's a story about Tom being heartbroken because Nicole left. \"The following week there's a Nicole story on how she lost the baby and Tom doesn't care. \"Remember, 60% of movie-ticket buyers are women, so a guy like Cruise doesn't want to turn off the woman in the midwest... It's all about bankability, acceptability and morality.\" Cruise, 38, is currently earning $25m plus a share of the profits from Minority Report, which he is making with Steven Spielberg, and is said to have a fortune of more than $100m, twice that of his wife.",

      "bodyText": "In the twilight of his papacy, John Paul II embarks today on one of the most ambitious and contentious missions of his celebrated career, heading into the heartlands of Orthodoxy, first in Greece and next month in Ukraine. If the Vatican project is aimed at laying the foundations for overcoming the great schism that sundered Catholic and Orthodox Christians almost a thousand years ago, the impact of the pope's trip looks more likely to divide than unite. Eighty years old and clearly infirm, the most widely travelled pope ever has been almost homebound for the past year, but the pilgrimage starting today marks a return to his obsessive globetrotting after an uncharacteristically long period in Rome. The visit to Greece, though agreed by the Greek Orthodox church hierarchy, has aroused outpourings of fury and suspicion among the Greek clergy, with Orthodox priests denouncing the pope as a heretic, the devil's envoy, and a monster. Anti-Vatican demonstrations are expected during the visit which took two years of painstaking official diplomacy to organise. The visit to Ukraine next month is even more contested and unparallelled in that it is taking place despite the formal and bluntly stated opposition of the Russian church hierarchy and the main Ukrainian Orthodox church which comes under Moscow's jurisdiction. \"This is the first time ever that the Vatican has in fact chosen to ignore the views of the Orthodox church,\" says Felix Corley who monitors religious affairs in the former Soviet Union for the Keston Institute. \"Patriarch Alexy said the pope can't come, the time is not right. And the pope said I'm coming anyway.\" For the first Slav pope who did so much to further the end of communism across much of the Orthodox world, the visits to Athens, Kiev, and Lviv in western Ukraine appear to have taken on great personal importance. Historic suspicions But for suspicious Orthodox leaders, the papal visits are all about intrusion, proselytising, and seeking ultimately to assert Vatican hegemony over the Orthodox world. \"These visits are very historic,\" says Father Igor Vyzhanov, the official at the Moscow patriarchate responsible for relations with Roman Catholicism. \"But if a Catholic sees them as a positive sign, it's a negative signal to the Orthodox believer. There are great historical wounds and the pope is rubbing salt into them.\" In John Paul's long campaign to woo the Orthodox, the big prize is a visit to Moscow - which Russian believers call the Third Rome - and a meeting with Patriarch Alexy, the hardline leader of the world's biggest Orthodox church. The Russian Orthodox Church is larger than all the other Orthodox churches combined which helps explain why the pope is so keen to come to Moscow. But the chances of such a meeting before John Paul dies have been reduced to almost nil; during the recent Orthodox Easter celebrations, the patriarch reiterated his opposition to hosting a papal visit. In visits to the Vatican, Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, and prime minister, Mikhail Kasyanov, have resisted Catholic pressure to agree to a papal trip. \"The arrival of the pope in Russia would cause an even greater reaction than we are currently seeing in Greece,\" says Father Vyzhanov. \"And the Ukraine trip makes things even worse, more impossible.\" Under pressure from the Moscow patriarchate, Russia is the only post-communist country not to have established full diplomatic relations with the Vatican in the decade since the iron curtain disintegrated in eastern Europe. Mr Corley says that Patriarch Alexy has concluded that he will never meet the Polish pope and that this realisation has spurred the Vatican to snub Moscow and go ahead with the Ukraine visit. The pope is to go to Lviv, the stronghold of Ukrainian nationalism in the west of the country where Greek Catholicism - the Uniates - is the dominant church. Historically, the Greek Catholics were established on the east European fringes of the Catholic Austro-Hungarian empire in the 17th century as part of imperial Vienna's attempt to convert the Orthodox. The Greek Catholics owe their loyalty to the Vatican while using Orthodox rites in their services. Since communism collapsed, the Orthodox and Uniates have been clashing, sometimes violently, over church property. Earlier this year the pope named two new cardinals in Ukraine, including the head of the Greek Catholics, of whom there are 5m. It emerged that one of the cardinals had been consecrated in 1998, but that his appointment had been kept secret. Paranoia Such arcane Vatican political manoeuvring feeds Orthodox paranoia and the suspicion that the Greek Catholics are being used as a Trojan horse with the aim of seeking converts from Orthodoxy to Roman Catholicism. The visit to Greece today is the first by a pope since the great schism of 1054 split christianity into Orthodox and Catholic churches and is expected to result in an ecumenical message issued jointly by the Vatican and Greek Orthodox leaders. But the chances of healing the rift between Rome and Constantinople are now looking as frail as Pope John Paul's health.",

So the big set-pieces - the plague of locusts, the parting of the red sea, a chariot race - are majestic creations, but it's a testimony to the emotional content that some of the best scenes are quieter and more reflective, such as Moses wandering in the monolithic night-time palace of the pharaohs. Voiced by the likes of Val Kilmer, Ralph Fiennes and Michelle Pfeiffer. </p> <p><strong> The Shawshank Redemption </strong> (Frank Darabont, 1994) 10pm, FilmFour<br>A richly emotive tale of male comradeship. Tim Robbins is accountant Andy Defresne, convicted of wife-murder in the 40s, despite protesting his innocence; Morgan Freeman is Red, the fixer, who befriends him at the brutal Shawshank state prison. With just a poster of Rita Hayworth and a tiny geological hammer to call his own, Defresne survives the sadistic regime of governor Bob Gunton by becoming his bookkeeper - but will he and Red realise their dream of boatbuilding on the beach?

      "body": "<p>I was shocked to discover that my husband of 30 years had been having an affair with a colleague for six months. Most hurtful was that he fell in love with her. He says he loves me and wants to stay with me. I realise I had taken him for granted. We went away for a weekend and our sexual relationship has returned to a mature honeymoon state. We agreed to try again and my husband promised not to see this woman. But I am a mess. I can't confide in my best friend or my three adult children. I don't want to visit Relate, but desperately want advice. Can our marriage work? Can I trust him? Am I mad to let him stay?</p> <p><b> Give him another chance</b></p> <p>You are not mad - everyone makes mistakes and one can't throw away 30 years, which I presume were good, even for something so damaging. You can make things better if you both want to and are willing to work at it. Trust is hard. When the same thing happened to me 15 years ago one of the worst things was realising that my husband was not entirely the person I thought he was. Who does know everything about anyone? It showed me that I couldn't take our settled situation for granted.</p> <p>He has rebuilt my trust. I believe he was at a point where he felt chances had passed him by. Lack of work satisfaction, with no prospect of improvement meant his self-esteem was very low. The affair gave his ego a great boost.</p> <p>I was devastated. Like you, I had no one I could talk to. My mind was in turmoil for months. I knew I wanted our marriage to continue - the fact that I didn't want anyone to know what had happened seemed to confirm this. For at least two years, each significant date was painful, and it was five years or more before the affair faded. Had I had a trustworthy friend it might have helped. Unfortunately, perhaps, my husband was, and still is, my best friend. Poetry helped, and writing down all the sad, unhappy, angry, resentful, hopeful thoughts.</p> <p>Do give both of you a second chance. I hope it works out and you will again be happy, as I am.<br><b>Name and address withheld</b></p> <p><b> Talk to someone about it</b><br></p> <p>Five years ago, my wife of 10 years admitted she'd been having an affair for a year. The realisation that my trusted partner could betray me so profoundly as to fall in love with another sent me into a strange place where none of the old rules applied.</p> <p>My immediate reaction was forgiveness and a determination to make the marriage work. Her behaviour seemed so out of character that I ascribed it to an extreme of empty-nest syndrome. Two years later, after the most abject misery of living through her deliberate destruction of what had been re-established, she left me for her lover. Without good friends, I know I would have killed myself.</p> <p>Do what you think is best for you. I've learned that we are born alone and die alone and are more alone in the middle bit than we think. The dilemma is that, to make your marriage work, you must learn to trust an untrustworthy person implicitly. If you can, your marriage might just be worth fighting for.</p> <p>It took two years to overcome my breakdown. I am now in a rewarding relationship (with thrilling sex!). I am secure, happy and fulfilled. I could have become embittered, but my friends kept my faith in human nature alive. It is essential that you talk to someone - the Samaritans or your best friend.

South Africa and Botswana are pressing Mr Chiluba to abandon his bid to perpetuate his increasingly unpopular decade-long rule, fearing that it will further destabilise a region already afflicted by the crisis in Zimbabwe and similar tampering with the constitution in Namibia. The expulsion of 22 officials from Zambia's ruling Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) defied a Lusaka high court injunction. Another court hearing is scheduled for today at which the ousted ministers want to overturn the purge. One of those expelled, labour secretary Edith Nawakwi, accused Mr Chiluba of wanting an unending presidency. \"The president knows the action is illegal. We have a court order restraining the party. But we also know how desperate he is to cling to power,\" she said. The South African president, Thabo Mbeki, first told Mr Chiluba a month ago that it would be a bad idea for him to amend the constitution and run again in elections later this year. Mr Mbeki and the Botswanan president, Festus Mogae, telephoned the Zambian leader last weekend ahead of a special MMD convention on Monday to amend party rules and adopt Mr Chiluba as its presidential candidate. The move lays the ground to change the country's constitution which limits the president to two five-year terms. About 200 delegates boycotted the convention after Mr Chiluba placed a ban on campaigning against the rule change, saying it would divide the party. Those that remained voted overwhelmingly to support the proposal. Some opponents who did attend, including three cabinet ministers, were beaten up by the president's supporters. But Mr Chiluba is far from assured of the two-thirds support he needs in parliament to alter the constitution. About half of Zambia's 158 parlia mentarians have signed a petition opposing the plan. Mr Chiluba is hoping to bolster support by threatening dissenting MPs with the loss of their seats. Armed police were deployed around the capital after demonstrations broke out at the news of the purge. The unions, churches and foreign aid donors have all criticised Mr Chiluba's plan to hang on to power 10 years after he ended more than two decades of one-party rule under Kenneth Kaunda by promising to be a very different kind of African leader. Many Zambians are angered by their president's actions particularly because he said several times he had no such plans. Mr Chiluba's opponents intend to try to recall parliament and seek a no-confidence vote. \"We, the leaders who oppose the amendment of the constitution, will employ every legal means to stop the president from going for another term of office,\" Ms Nawakwi said. Mr Chiluba was also condemned by the country's trade union confederation which first lifted him to power. \"History has taught us that the continued stay of presidents in office has built them into dictators and that dictators often survive by resorting to large scale abuse,\" said the confederation's general secretary, Derrick Chaala.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Admiral Sir Charles Madden, who has died aged 94, was the former commander-in-chief (C-in-C) of the Home Fleet. He would rather have been an artist but, inevitably, followed his father, Admiral of the Fleet Sir Charles Madden, into the Royal Navy as a cadet of 13.</p> <p>He was born with an assortment of nautical silver spoons in his mouth; his mother was the daughter of shipowner Sir Charles Cayzer, and his aunt was the wife of Admiral of the Fleet Earl Jellicoe. Yet Madden ascended the career ladder on merit, most prominently displayed in his role as commander (executive officer) of the battleship Warspite in the Mediterranean in 1940-42.</p> <p>Since this modernised 1913 vessel was then the flagship of Admiral Sir Andrew Browne Cunningham - commander-in-chief of the Mediterranean fleet and Britain's most successful fighting admiral of the second world war - merit alone was not enough. Charm, modesty and tact were also needed to deal with the fearsome \"ABC\", as he was unsurprisingly known on the lower decks. By then, Madden was engaged to Olive Robins, but the war kept them apart for another two years.</p> <p>Cunningham acknowledged Madden's contribution to the smooth running of one of the navy's busiest warships - she wore out three sets of eight 15-inch gun barrels in the Mediterranean alone - by giving him an official mention in dispatches. Warspite and Madden took part in such major engagements as the carrier attack on the Italian port of Taranto in November 1940, and, early in 1941, the battles of Calabria and Cape Matapan, the navy's last battlefleet action, and the shelling of Tripoli.</p> <p>The successful evacuation of British forces from Crete in May 1941, in the teeth of locally overwhelming Axis air superiority, was, for the Royal Navy, a disaster in instalments. Altogether, 50% of Cunningham's fleet, already reduced by earlier fighting - and soon to take more punishment - was hit. A carrier and two battleships, including Warspite, which was bombed, were put out of action, three cruisers were sunk and five damaged, six destroyers lost and seven crippled.</p> <p>The bomb struck Warspite's starboard side, starting a large fire and killing 40 men. As the ship crawled back towards Alexandria, Madden coolly took command of the firefighting and damage control, a task that culminated in the extrication of the dead from a tangle of twisted and scorched metal on both his own ship and a shattered cruiser. He stayed with the ship while she was patched up and sent to America for a complete refit, and was still aboard when she sailed to the Indian ocean to become Admiral Sir James Somerville's flagship.</p> <p>Having fallen in with paternal wishes, Madden was educated at the Royal Naval College, Osborne, and duly graduated from Dartmouth, at a ceremony where his father, then C-in-C, Home Fleet, handed out the prizes. By gaining a posting to China in a cruiser, he did, however, manage to frustrate his father's plan to find him a soft berth on the royal yacht.</p> <p>Madden became a first-class gunnery specialist, then still the best route to promotion, and served in battleships and cruisers in the Far East and the Mediterranean. An appointment as gunnery officer on the battlecruiser Hood was cancelled, which saved his life; the flagship of the British fleet was sunk by the Bismarck with the loss of all but three hands in May 1941.</p> <p>When his father died in 1935, Madden inherited the baronetcy and, in 1939, was promoted to commander at the early age of 33, joining Warspite within a year.

      "bodyText": "Admiral Sir Charles Madden, who has died aged 94, was the former commander-in-chief (C-in-C) of the Home Fleet. He would rather have been an artist but, inevitably, followed his father, Admiral of the Fleet Sir Charles Madden, into the Royal Navy as a cadet of 13. He was born with an assortment of nautical silver spoons in his mouth; his mother was the daughter of shipowner Sir Charles Cayzer, and his aunt was the wife of Admiral of the Fleet Earl Jellicoe. Yet Madden ascended the career ladder on merit, most prominently displayed in his role as commander (executive officer) of the battleship Warspite in the Mediterranean in 1940-42. Since this modernised 1913 vessel was then the flagship of Admiral Sir Andrew Browne Cunningham - commander-in-chief of the Mediterranean fleet and Britain's most successful fighting admiral of the second world war - merit alone was not enough. Charm, modesty and tact were also needed to deal with the fearsome \"ABC\", as he was unsurprisingly known on the lower decks. By then, Madden was engaged to Olive Robins, but the war kept them apart for another two years. Cunningham acknowledged Madden's contribution to the smooth running of one of the navy's busiest warships - she wore out three sets of eight 15-inch gun barrels in the Mediterranean alone - by giving him an official mention in dispatches. Warspite and Madden took part in such major engagements as the carrier attack on the Italian port of Taranto in November 1940, and, early in 1941, the battles of Calabria and Cape Matapan, the navy's last battlefleet action, and the shelling of Tripoli. The successful evacuation of British forces from Crete in May 1941, in the teeth of locally overwhelming Axis air superiority, was, for the Royal Navy, a disaster in instalments. Altogether, 50% of Cunningham's fleet, already reduced by earlier fighting - and soon to take more punishment - was hit. A carrier and two battleships, including Warspite, which was bombed, were put out of action, three cruisers were sunk and five damaged, six destroyers lost and seven crippled. The bomb struck Warspite's starboard side, starting a large fire and killing 40 men. As the ship crawled back towards Alexandria, Madden coolly took command of the firefighting and damage control, a task that culminated in the extrication of the dead from a tangle of twisted and scorched metal on both his own ship and a shattered cruiser. He stayed with the ship while she was patched up and sent to America for a complete refit, and was still aboard when she sailed to the Indian ocean to become Admiral Sir James Somerville's flagship. Having fallen in with paternal wishes, Madden was educated at the Royal Naval College, Osborne, and duly graduated from Dartmouth, at a ceremony where his father, then C-in-C, Home Fleet, handed out the prizes. By gaining a posting to China in a cruiser, he did, however, manage to frustrate his father's plan to find him a soft berth on the royal yacht. Madden became a first-class gunnery specialist, then still the best route to promotion, and served in battleships and cruisers in the Far East and the Mediterranean. An appointment as gunnery officer on the battlecruiser Hood was cancelled, which saved his life; the flagship of the British fleet was sunk by the Bismarck with the loss of all but three hands in May 1941. When his father died in 1935, Madden inherited the baronetcy and, in 1939, was promoted to commander at the early age of 33, joining Warspite within a year. After that, he spent two years as deputy director of the gunnery division at the Admiralty. In the winter of 1944, as an acting captain, he was given his first command, of the escort-carrier Emperor, in the Far East fleet. He was mentioned in dispatches for his work in providing air cover for operations in Malaya and Burma. After the war, Madden was once again subjected to the blast of the personality of ABC, by then first sea lord, when he served as his naval assistant. He stayed on to support the unrelated Sir John Cunningham in the same post. In 1947, he took command of the 6th destroyer flotilla, specialising in anti-submarine warfare. After staff appointments in London, Madden's career took an unusual turn in 1953, with an assignment, in the honorary rank of commodore, as chief of staff of the New Zealand navy, which was about to expand. Two years later, he was promoted rear-admiral and given a post on the Board of Admiralty, where he was instrumental in streamlining the structure of the officer corps into one general list. In 1957, he became flag officer, Malta, where his diplomatic skills were fully engaged in dealing with the fiery nationalist leader, Dom Mintoff.

      "bodyText": "After its recent, and some would say excessive recovery, Baltimore, the internet security specialist, should be avoided, according to analysts' advice. Some believe the company is about to give the market details of a reorganisation plan to save cash, while others claim there have been high-level resignations at Content Technologies, the email security firm Baltimore acquired last year for \u00a3700m. Apparently one of Content's founders and five members of the sales team have walked out. Baltimore was expected to lose \u00a320m this year before its profits warnings in March and April. Analysts subsequently downgraded their revenue forecasts to \u00a3107m from \u00a3157m, which means Baltimore has to cut \u00a348m of costs to keep its losses in line with market expectations. Baltimore shares closed down 0.25p at 88p yesterday.",

Masterminded by Bruce Reynolds, it was one of the most carefully planned robberies of the century - right down to the detailed timetabling of the trains.

      "body": "<p>Helena Kennedy's comments regarding the use of genetic testing are extremely encouraging (Insurer 'broke code on gene information', May 2). At last there is recognition of the serious public concern about the use of genetic tests for insurance purposes. We are concerned that women with breast cancer will be deterred from being tested for fear of difficulties in obtaining insurance afterwards.</p> <p>A positive result for one of the genes linked to hereditary breast cancer is no guarantee that a woman will develop the disease - or, if so, when. We are also concerned that the establishment of the genetics and insurance committee to oversee the use of these tests has pre-empted a full public debate on the issue. We strongly urge the government to pursue a moratorium on the use of genetic testing by insurers, backed by legislation if necessary. <br><b>Delyth Morgan </b><br> Chief executive, Breakthrough</p> <p>\u0095 The human genetics commission response to the issue of the use of genetic tests in insurance is far too weak.

      "bodyText": "Helena Kennedy's comments regarding the use of genetic testing are extremely encouraging (Insurer 'broke code on gene information', May 2). At last there is recognition of the serious public concern about the use of genetic tests for insurance purposes. We are concerned that women with breast cancer will be deterred from being tested for fear of difficulties in obtaining insurance afterwards. A positive result for one of the genes linked to hereditary breast cancer is no guarantee that a woman will develop the disease - or, if so, when. We are also concerned that the establishment of the genetics and insurance committee to oversee the use of these tests has pre-empted a full public debate on the issue. We strongly urge the government to pursue a moratorium on the use of genetic testing by insurers, backed by legislation if necessary. Delyth Morgan Chief executive, Breakthrough \u0095 The human genetics commission response to the issue of the use of genetic tests in insurance is far too weak. A three-year voluntary moratorium will not give the public confidence required because the insurance industry has already shown itself to be untrustworthy by ignoring its own guidelines. The principle that genetic makeup should not be used as a basis for discrimination is not going to change over the next three years. Freedom from genetic discrimination should be a human right and people should be able to take genetic tests if they wish, confident that the information will be kept private and not used as a justification for refusing insurance cover or employment.

      "body": "<p>For me, Alfie started when my wife went to see the play, just as an ordinary punter. When she came back she said, \"You've got to make this into a film.\" I'm an east end boy, so the play appealed to me greatly. It also possessed what I always look for in a film, in that it was funny but had a touch of sadness, too. Terence Stamp was in the running for the part, which seems strange now, because he shared a flat with Michael Caine. But when Terry did the play on Broadway, which didn't go well, he decided he couldn't carry on with it. </p> <p>We were desperate for a cockney to play the part, and my son - who was associate producer and a friend of Caine's - said: \"What about Michael?\" Michael hadn't done a lot at that point. But when I saw The Ipcress File, I was impressed. So I rang Paramount and said: \"There's only one person who can play this part, and that's Michael Caine.\" \"Michael who?\" they said. \"We've never heard of him.\" \"You will,\" I said, \"Trust me.\" They said: \"OK, it's just a cheap little British film, you go ahead and make it.\" </p> <p>Our first idea, which was pretty revolutionary at the time, was that Alfie should talk to the camera. In my early films, it was always stressed: \"Don't let your eyes hit the lens - that would make it false.\" But TV audiences became used to people looking at them out of a screen. In the event, they quickly cottoned on. </p> <p>Of course, you never know if a film will be successful. My Bond pictures [You Only Live Twice, The Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker] are the only ones where I've known there's a huge audience waiting to see the film. With Alfie, we never had that knowledge - but it was a very smooth shoot. Everything went according to plan, except one thing: the police weren't as cooperative then as they are today about filming in the street. </p> <p>We spent an entire night shooting those scenes on London Bridge at the beginning and end of the film. I was sitting on a crane at 6am, having been there since five the previous evening. It had been a long night for everybody. We were wet, cold and miserable, but we had to get that last shot. To do that, we had to hold up all the traffic on the bridge, mostly truck drivers. The poor chap at the sharp end was on his walkie-talkie, saying: \"I've got to let them go!\" Eventually we got the shot and let the traffic through. A lorry stopped and its driver looked at me and said: \"Why don't you get yourself a proper job?\" It was so funny, it cheered me up a bit. </p> <p>The premiere was at the Plaza, and the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and George Best were there. It was incredible. Alfie is rooted into the world of the swinging 60s. My son was only 24 at the time but he was into the Chelsea scene and knew all the people: Michael, Terry Stamp, Jean Shrimpton. Suddenly young people were the centre of the world - not 30- or 40-year-olds. </p> <p>When we first screened it in America - to 400 people at Paramount - my anxiety was that they wouldn't understand the cockney. But they loved it. The head of the studio said: \"When I read the script, I wanted to scrap this picture. I couldn't understand it. I'm amazed the way it's turned out.\" </p> <p>They were still worried about the cockney, though. The chief of distribution said, \"When we open the film in America, we ought to dub it. What about Tony Curtis?\" I said: \"No, you mustn't do that! It's the fact that it's cockney that makes itinteresting.\" He replied: \"You'll see I'm right when we open in New York.\" We broke the house record in two cinemas when we opened in New York. </p> <p>At that time, there had never been a cockney film. In cinema, the cockney was the man who said: \"Guvnor, your car's outside.\" You never saw a cockney family with real problems. In the 60s, we were beginning to make films that reflected something of the British way of life. Before Alfie and its contemporaries, British film was all No\u00ebl Coward and drawing rooms. </p> <p>Like everything else, censorship was changing fast in England in the 60s. But in the States you couldn't mention abortion in a film, never mind see someone perform one. Alfie showed both sides of the question. We showed the disaster of using a back-street abortionist, but also showed Alfie's conscience when he saw the results of a botched operation. The US censor rang me and said: \"We like the film, we want to pass it, and we are trying to change our code.\" And they did - not just because of Alfie, but it helped. In a way, that pushed their cinema into the 20th century. Until then, it had been Doris Day playing virgins at 45! </p> <p>It is amazing how the film reflects its time. The attitude of women to men was so different then. Women jumped around as much as men, of course. But the difference is that they were dependent on men, because it was unheard of for a woman to be the head of a company. Men can no longer behave as badly as they did in the 60s. </p> <p>Actually, Alfie was an infinitely sad character. His philosophy could only spell disaster for himself. That's where Bill Naughton's script was clever. Alfie was a charming rogue - he was good-looking and he knew how to \"pull the birds\". He was immoral, but the damage he inflicted was on himself. That comes out at the end of the film, although by then he isn't able to change and will probably end up a 60-year-old man still trying to do what he's been doing all along, but failing. That's not a very good life, is it? He's a bit like James Bond, but in a totally different way. Men envy Bond because he has all these adventures and he gets all these wonderful women. Can you imagine having a scene where he's walking along saying, \"My life is so awful\"? But that's the strength of Alfie. </p> <p>The film had a big effect on my career. I was offered everything; I was flavour of the month in Hollywood. And Alfie was nominated for five Academy awards. It amazed me how seriously the Americans took the whole ceremony. It was lovely being there, but I never felt as if winning was a matter of life and death. I remember that, going in, everyone was telling Burt Bacharach, who wrote the theme song: \"Burt, you're going to win it tonight, best song, no question.\" Up comes the award - \"Best song: Born Free\". Well, the poor man was absolutely shattered. I said: \"Burt, are you coming out afterwards?\" He said: \"I think I'll go straight home.\" </p> <p>To have it all again, 35 years later, is more exciting for me than being at the Oscars. This week I sat in the theatre where Alfie premiered, at a BFI preview of the re-release. People were laughing and enjoying it, and I was awarded with a fellowship of the BFI, which was a hell of a surprise. It was as if I were dreaming a silly dream that they brought back Alfie and we all went to the same cinema and some of the same people were there, as well as others who weren't even born back then. I thought: \"This must be a dream, it's so weird.\" It was one of the best nights of my life. </p> <p>Alfie is re-released next Friday.</p>",

That comes out at the end of the film, although by then he isn't able to change and will probably end up a 60-year-old man still trying to do what he's been doing all along, but failing. That's not a very good life, is it? He's a bit like James Bond, but in a totally different way. Men envy Bond because he has all these adventures and he gets all these wonderful women. Can you imagine having a scene where he's walking along saying, \"My life is so awful\"? But that's the strength of Alfie. The film had a big effect on my career. I was offered everything; I was flavour of the month in Hollywood. And Alfie was nominated for five Academy awards. It amazed me how seriously the Americans took the whole ceremony. It was lovely being there, but I never felt as if winning was a matter of life and death. I remember that, going in, everyone was telling Burt Bacharach, who wrote the theme song: \"Burt, you're going to win it tonight, best song, no question.\" Up comes the award - \"Best song: Born Free\". Well, the poor man was absolutely shattered. I said: \"Burt, are you coming out afterwards?\" He said: \"I think I'll go straight home.\" To have it all again, 35 years later, is more exciting for me than being at the Oscars. This week I sat in the theatre where Alfie premiered, at a BFI preview of the re-release. People were laughing and enjoying it, and I was awarded with a fellowship of the BFI, which was a hell of a surprise. It was as if I were dreaming a silly dream that they brought back Alfie and we all went to the same cinema and some of the same people were there, as well as others who weren't even born back then. I thought: \"This must be a dream, it's so weird.\" It was one of the best nights of my life. Alfie is re-released next Friday.",

      "body": "<p>Progressing along the Croisette at Cannes one morning, on the way to an interview with a famous Hollywood actor, I observed a crowd outside the Carlton hotel gazing with more than the usual curiosity at a fifth-floor window. Out of it protruded two large and bare backsides. One is prepared for almost anything at the world's glitziest film festival, but this seemed a trifle more surprising than usual. They were, I was assured, the bottoms of two very well-known actors, one American, one French. I have no absolute certainty as to their identities. Nor could I ever establish conclusively whether the twin gestures, the conclusion of a night on the tiles that had clearly still not ended at 10 the next morning, involved the star I was about to meet. </p> <p>All I knew was that it was a bad omen for my interview. Sure enough, when I finally tore myself away from the scene and proceeded to my destination, a harassed press officer told me first that the star would be a little late and, half an hour later, that the interview had unfortunately to be cancelled since \"the talent has overslept\". </p> <p>This was not, however, the most embarrassing moment of my 20 years or so at Cannes. That came when, in the middle of a particularly awful movie, I could restrain myself no longer and said to my neighbour: \"God, isn't this crap?\" \"Yes, I know,\" he said. \"I wrote it.\" I've kept my lips sealed at screenings ever since. </p> <p>I have to say that at Cannes a peculiar form of madness often beckons, brought on by too many films too early in the day - the first one starts at 8.30am - too many 20-minute interviews with a weary star or director alongside eight or nine others, not all of whom want the interviewee to say anything remotely sensible, and too many late nights grumbling over too much wine about the enormities of one's day. </p> <p>Make no mistake, Cannes is a tough job, even though a lot of water has flowed under the bridge since the late John Gillett, scion of the British Film Institute, left his seat in the main auditorium at Cannes to complain about a less than precise screening, only to be dismissed by a projectionist threatening him with a loaded gun. It seems a long time, too, since Sylvester Stallone, then at his peak as the toughest of action stars, skipped Cannes for fear of terrorist attack, and the Palais was guarded by police with dogs, as likely to set upon late-arriving critics as on any undesirable elements. </p> <p>In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Cannes was a fairly dangerous place to be, despite the fact that terrorists never came near the place. The danger actually came from the peevish overpolicing, the thugs at the door who seemed to delight in turning people away rather than letting them in, and the hordes of thieves and cutthroats who came to town to make merry among the well-lined, either on the streets or in the grander hotels. One such hotel had an entire floor robbed room by room in a single night. And two female friends of mine, relaxing in a cafe at the end of the festival, were Maced and divested of their handbags over dessert. </p> <p>There will still be a lot of police about next week, and you still don't leave your passport and money unguarded in your room. Nor, if you are wise, do you walk the back streets alone after midnight, particularly if you are a woman. But they say \"Bonjour\" to you at the theatre doors these days, and the atmosphere is considerably more relaxed. </p> <p>On the other hand, it is never advisable to be too relaxed at Cannes. Blink and you'll miss something, whether you are there for the sake of art or commerce. And because the art is about the best you can get at film festivals these days, and the commerce gets more frenetic year by year, Cannes remains the mecca for both. No other festival equals it, despite the fact that Hollywood, not wishing to spend an inordinate amount of money on a film that fails to win a prize, has kept its participation less than large-scale. </p> <p>The days are long gone when a big Hollywood film was supported not only by its star but by a dozen executives and their wives, often at a cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars. It's even longer since you could meet a world-famous director casually sipping coffee somewhere and sit down to talk with him about his new film. Now literally hundreds of journos will want to see him, and one-to-one interviews are at a premium. </p> <p>Whatever you do, it's an expensive place to be. At the Hotel du Cap, a convenient distance from the milling throng on the Croisette, where many of the stars and rich producers are housed, you can pay only in cash. Here, critics and reporters due for interviews are ushered in through the staff entrance and discouraged from mixing with the guests. It was here that I once interviewed Madonna, who told me that the coffee and croissants she was offering me were more expensive than her shoes. </p> <p>And it was in Cannes itself that I heard the following conversation in a hotel lobby between an American guest and the concierge: \"I want to change my room. There's water dripping from the ceiling on to my bed, the carpets are worn out and the shower has no hot water.\" \"What do you expect, madam, for $400 a night?\" </p> <p>Nothing is quite what you might expect at Cannes. And it has to be said that some of the surprises are pleasant. It is nice having lunch on the beach, even if the result can be a terrible urge to close your eyes during the afternoon film - to which some people have been known to go simply to have a nap. Naps, it must be said, are common at the end of a long festival. Once, during the final competition film, a distinguished critic was snoring so loudly that someone tapped her on the shoulder and complained: \"Madam, could you please stop snoring? You're waking us all up.\" Critics, like everyone else, can't help themselves sometimes. </p> <p>Generally, however, we behave ourselves reasonably well, as befits those who get in free and can say what they like afterwards in print. Cannes is capable of boring you stiff and irritating you almost beyond measure, but it can also impart in the most cynical of souls a renewed faith in the power and strength of cinema. There is nothing quite like it, and we progress next week to the best festival in the world in the certainty that we will see half a dozen films at least that make even the travails of its present commerciality worthwhile.</p>",

The studio heads - none of whom earned less than $60m last year - seem happy to endure strikes that the LA mayor's office estimates will cost the Los Angeles economy $6bn. And while the majors are counselling fiscal austerity, Disney is spending $5m (a tax- deductible expense) on its Pearl Harbor premiere - to be held on a specially-converted aircraft carrier - just as it announces 4,000 layoffs, the kind of fuck-you, scorched-earth management of which Walt would heartily approve. </p> <p>Bread and Roses celebrates the victory of the hugely important Justice For Janitors campaign several years ago. The poorest workers in LA, those who clean downtown LA's corporate offices, defeated propery giants in an innovative campaign that simply shamed them into paying up.

My illusions about LA (not to mention LA Law) were serially shattered with every file. Pre-war 16mm film cans marked \"private detective footage\" showed picketers outside car plants in Van Nuys.

The committee said that Mr Robinson had failed to provide full answers when it originally investigated an alleged payment of \u00a3200,000 which he was said to have received from a company controlled by the publishing tycoon. But the committee gave Mr Robinson an additional three months to provide further evidence as to whether he did actually receive the payment - a claim which he denies. Mr Robinson said he accepted the committee's findings but added: \"I am determined to prove I did not receive the payment.\" He said he would trawl Pergamon company records to find the disputed cheque. The allegation surfaced in a recent biography of Mr Robinson, MP for Coventry North West, by the investigative journalist, Tom Bower. The committee's finding sparked immediate calls from the Conservatives for Mr Robinson to have the whip withdrawn, since this was the fourth inquiry into his business affairs since the 1997 election. The Tory trade and industry spokesman, David Heathcoat-Amory, said: \"If they are serious about cleaning up sleaze in the Labour party then I think they ought to take action against a serial offender.

The committee described Mr Robinson's denial that he received the \u00a3200,000 payment as a \"subsidiary point\". \"Mr Robinson has told us that he will seek the agreement of the administrators of Pergamon AGB plc (a Maxwell company) to his carrying out a thorough search of that company's records in the hope of finding the cheque which is at the centre of the allegations and thereby establishing to who it was made payable and who received it,\" the committee reported. The original agreement related to a deal Mr Robinson struck with Maxwell in 1990 for his company, TransTec, to provide management services to Lock - including his own services as executive chairman. In October 1990, Mr Robinson sent an invoice to the parent company, Hollis, asking for his fee of \u00a3200,000 - with the cheque to be made payable to TransTec. \"Whether the payment was intended to be made to Mr Robinson or TransTec is immaterial.

Now it is time for them to be reasonable and do what they know is right,\" he said.</p> <p>Camelot's head of external affairs, Sue Slipman, acknowledged that the law did not stop the company from paying the couple out of their own profits. But that would \"open the floodgates\" to claims worth millions of pounds, which could jeopardise the whole game. </p> <p>Mr Tott told GMTV today: \"I am encouraged very much for someone of Chris Smith's stature to support us.\" </p> <p>He claimed that a previous lottery player who did not have a ticket received payment from Camelot after four months. </p> <p>\"There was a precedent before us they conveniently failed to mention,\" Mr Tott said. </p> <p>Asked whether it was fair that the claim could not be accepted because it would open the way for many other claims, Mr Tott said: \"No ... because I think that is the reason their security department is there.\" </p> <p><strong>Related articles</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/lottery/story/0,7369,481701,00.html\">02.05.2001, feature: The couple who lost out on \u00a33m</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/lottery/story/0,7369,415057,00.html\">23.12.2000: Interview with Camelot's chief executive, Dianne Thompson</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/theissues/article/0,6512,358311,00.html\">The issue explained: The national lottery</a><br></p> <p><strong>Video</strong><br> <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/olmedia/video/events98/question/question.ram\">Watch Question Time with Chris Smith</a><br></p> <p><strong>Netnotes</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/netnotes/article/0,6729,357595,00.html\">National lottery</a><br></p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.camelotplc.com/home/index.asp\">Camelot</a><br><a href=\"http://www.culture.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Department of Culture, Media and Sport</a><br><a href=\"http://www.nationallotterycommission.gov.uk/\">National lottery commission</a><br><a href=\"http://www.national-lottery.co.uk/\">National lottery site</a><br></p>",

Mr Smith said he hoped the lottery organisers would \"see reason\" and give the cash to Kay and Martyn Tott, from Watford, Herts, who missed out because they did not register a claim within the stipulated 30-day period. \"There is no legal requirement on them to do so, but if I were them, I would,\" he said during BBC1's Question Time. Asked if he would use his powers to persuade Camelot to pay up or face losing its licence he said: \"Well, they've got their licence back, but I hope that they will actually see reason in this matter.\" But Camelot later said its position remained \"unchanged\". \"It is not a question of 'seeing reason' - it is about upholding rules that protect the national lottery and its ability to raise funds for the public good.\" Kay, 24, and Martyn, 33, had answered a TV appeal on March 5 over an unclaimed jackpot ticket bought in their area for the midweek draw on September 6 last year. By then there were just hours left before the 180-day claims deadline for winning tickets ran out, but they could not find the all-important slip. After weeks of investigations, Camelot decided to stick to the 30-day rule and reject the claim. Publicist Max Clifford, who is representing the couple, said he had tapes of telephone conversations showing Camelot built up their hopes over seven weeks, only to disappoint them. \"Most of the British public are totally behind them and now Chris Smith is as well. Now it is time for them to be reasonable and do what they know is right,\" he said. Camelot's head of external affairs, Sue Slipman, acknowledged that the law did not stop the company from paying the couple out of their own profits. But that would \"open the floodgates\" to claims worth millions of pounds, which could jeopardise the whole game. Mr Tott told GMTV today: \"I am encouraged very much for someone of Chris Smith's stature to support us.\" He claimed that a previous lottery player who did not have a ticket received payment from Camelot after four months. \"There was a precedent before us they conveniently failed to mention,\" Mr Tott said. Asked whether it was fair that the claim could not be accepted because it would open the way for many other claims, Mr Tott said: \"No ... because I think that is the reason their security department is there.\" Related articles 02.05.2001, feature: The couple who lost out on \u00a33m 23.12.2000: Interview with Camelot's chief executive, Dianne Thompson The issue explained: The national lottery Video Watch Question Time with Chris Smith Netnotes National lottery Useful links Camelot Department of Culture, Media and Sport National lottery commission National lottery site",
