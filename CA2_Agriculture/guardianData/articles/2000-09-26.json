Britain has only 35 in the top rank. </p> <p>The German market is more mature, with half of the businesses surveyed already in profit compared with little more than a quarter of British net firms. Kevin Ellis, a partner with PwC, said the Germans were bolstered by better access to the web. </p> <p>The survey findings will pile further political pressure on British Telecom which has been criticised for holding up the introduction of broadband services. Rivals have accused the former monopoly of dragging its feet over the break-up of its local network next year. </p> <p>The head of one internet company also pointed to the success of the German Neuer Markt as one reason for the gap with Britain. </p> <p>\"The Neuer Markt is largely responsible for the success of e-commerce companies in Germany... It makes it easier to raise money and make acquisitions,\" said Raphael Fuchs, chief operating officer of europeaninvestor.com, which operates websites for other companies and provides financial information. Frankfurt moved faster than London to set up a specialist market dedicated to hi-tech companies, so Germany had become a natural focus for investors looking to back young companies with high growth potential. </p> <p>It was not all bad news for Britain. The PwC survey noted clear evidence of better management, leading to lower costs and reduced \"cash burn\" - the rate at which money is consumed by a start-up business. </p> <p>The average burn rate is now 20 months before the need to raise new money, an increase of seven months since last December. One company in the survey slowed its burn rate by up to four times. </p> <p>Mr Ellis said: \"I am surprised at how much companies appear to have taken action to improve their burn rates. Forty-two out of 150 are not burning cash any more, which is encouraging. It means that people are moving into the next stage of development.\" </p> <p><strong> High risk</strong><br> </p> <p> The survey ranked 20 of the 150 companies as being at \"high risk\" of running out of cash within a year unless they act. It does not name the individual stocks because of concern that this could upset the still volatile internet market. \"At risk is a combined market capitalisation of \u20ac26bn (\u00a316bn), representing more than 10% of the European market,\" the report said. </p> <p>PwC also found a difference between consumer businesses - known as B2C - and business to business (B2B) companies. B2C companies are more vulnerable with an average burn rate of 15 months, compared to 23 months for B2B organisations, due to higher marketing costs. </p> <p>There are also sector distinctions, with software and infrastructure internet companies performing better than content producers and internet service providers. </p> <p>Rivals doubted PwC's findings. Richard Punt, head of e-business at Deloitte and Touche, said it was difficult to conclude that Germany was the dominant country because the survey was based on market value and ignored factors such as funding types or internet penetration. </p> <p>Peter Bradshaw, head of internet research at Merrill Lynch, said: \"To us the report looks like gross misrepresentation of a few figures.\" </p> <p>Mr Ellis concluded that the next six months will see consolidation in the internet sector, with some big success stories but some more big failures. \"There still will be some failures because this is a start-up area in a brand new sector, but failures don't necessarily mean it's the end of the sector or a disaster.\"</p>",

It does not name the individual stocks because of concern that this could upset the still volatile internet market. \"At risk is a combined market capitalisation of \u20ac26bn (\u00a316bn), representing more than 10% of the European market,\" the report said. PwC also found a difference between consumer businesses - known as B2C - and business to business (B2B) companies. B2C companies are more vulnerable with an average burn rate of 15 months, compared to 23 months for B2B organisations, due to higher marketing costs. There are also sector distinctions, with software and infrastructure internet companies performing better than content producers and internet service providers. Rivals doubted PwC's findings. Richard Punt, head of e-business at Deloitte and Touche, said it was difficult to conclude that Germany was the dominant country because the survey was based on market value and ignored factors such as funding types or internet penetration. Peter Bradshaw, head of internet research at Merrill Lynch, said: \"To us the report looks like gross misrepresentation of a few figures.\" Mr Ellis concluded that the next six months will see consolidation in the internet sector, with some big success stories but some more big failures. \"There still will be some failures because this is a start-up area in a brand new sector, but failures don't necessarily mean it's the end of the sector or a disaster.\"",

Piazzolla created a work that is both authentically a tango and an authentic fugue - a deft compositional trick. But he is not afraid, in other numbers, to indulge in the tango's sheer sensuousness.

But Watkiss and his current ensemble the Source are assured, adept performers, and by the drawn-out second number, Blessing in Disguise (taken from Watkiss's 1991 album of the same title), they evince an absorbingly spiritual ambience. Watkiss namechecks his players repeatedly during the set; many of them head their own outfits, such as superbly dexterous pianist Alex Wilson, virtuoso trumpet/flugelhorn player Byron Wallen, and the intricate guitarist Ciyo Brown (who also lends some fine backing vocals). When Watkiss declares that these are \"some of the baddest musicians in the country\", the audience cheer in agreement.

But it's the sounds rather than specific words that convey his music's raw emotion and beauty, whether he's presenting older material, such as Green Chimneys (setting vocals to his hero Thelonious Monk's instrumental) or the newer compositions encompassing earthy dub, muscular double bass, funky brass, rich keyboards and lithe percussion. Most of all, Watkiss's voice can sound wondrous: when he holds onto a note, it evolves from soulful croon to human beatbox, rounding off with didgeridoo effects. He freestyles with ease. No doubt as a consequence of his work with Asian breakbeats pioneer Talvin Singh (he collaborated on Singh's Mercury awardwinning album OK in 1999), Watkiss has taken to incorporating complex classical Indian stylings into his rapid-fire scat jazz vocals. It's a thrilling, innovative yet harmonious fusion. Whenever Watkiss adds new directions to his musical journey, he's in his element.</p>",

But the evening, in its precise casting, command of mood and gradual accumulation of suspense, also reminds us why Mendes really is a great director. </p> <p>The setting is France in 1918. The characters are mainly members of an elite, hand-picked tank-crew who seem to have been blessed by fortune. Now, on the eve of a major battle, they are doubly unnerved. First there is the arrival of a probing American journalist seeking some image that will encapsulate this most hellish of wars. Even more disturbing is the crew's apprehension of certain death: the feeling that the protective spirit has abandoned them. So they seriously debate whether in battle they should nobble their machine and thus ensure their survival. </p> <p>Up to its last quarter hour, this strikes me as an honest, unglamorous portrait of war. Whitby, whose previous convictions include a South American trilogy, has clearly done his homework. He knows all about Mark IV tanks, about the provision of prostitutes for men on the edge of battle and about the death-fixated \"holy friars\" who scented carnage. Even more importantly, he understands fear: in a sense, the play is an extension of the eve-of-Agincourt passage from Henry V, where Williams says that though they may see the beginning of the day, \"I think we shall never see the end of it\". </p> <p>I don't doubt the accuracy of Whitby's portrait, even down to the presence of Punjab and Caribbean gunners and technicians. His play is also saltily written and emotionally affecting: there's a heart-stopping moment when one of the crew first indicates to the Belgian prostitute that death is inevitable. But, without revealing the climax, it has a touch of what Paul Fussell called \"the chivalric mystique of self-sacrifice\" which war-poets like Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen did so much to deflate. Whitby resolves the death-or-life debate theatrically but not intellectually. </p> <p>The flaws are camouflaged, however, by Mendes's production, by Anthony Ward's afforested design and by the quality of the acting. Dougray Scott as the socialist-mystic chief, Ray Winstone as the ruggedly honest tank-driver, Finbar Lynch as the vehement proponent of survival, Adrian Scarborough as the working-class religious believer and Nitin Ganatra as the Punjabi gunner stand out in a first- rate ensemble. Mendes both brings out each character's singularity and reminds us that war, like theatre, relies on mutual dependence.

For those who believe in it, sick building syndrome has long been thought to stem from poorly maintained air conditioning systems, toxic photocopiers and dusty offices. Now, in a curious echo of another of our greatest workplace fears, it seems the explanation could lie in a particularly nasty form of computer virus. </p> <p>According to a team of Swedish scientists, flame-retardant chemicals used in plastic computer casings could be to blame. The researchers conducted experiments which showed how, as computers heated up during the course of the working day, they began to emit into the air an allergenic chemical, triphenyl phosphate. Eighteen leading brands of computer were tested and now the experts are urging manufacturers to \"bake off\" new computers for 10 days to release the worst of the chemicals before they arrive in office buildings. </p> <p>The discovery may finally provide the evidence needed to convince those who still need convincing that sick building syndrome has a scientific basis, instead of being a malingerer's charter. The Health and Safety Executive, which monitors office environments, estimates that between a third and a half of all new or re-conditioned buildings are afflicted; the employees at highest risk, according to a recent study by the University of Strathclyde, are clerical workers who wear contact lenses and work at computers in air-conditioned buildings. Airborne bacteria in such offices, which often have low levels of humidity, become electrically charged and settle on computer screens or on contact lenses, or are breathed in. </p> <p>The travels of bacteria around offices and into workers' nostrils may not be an appetising field of study, but professor Derek Clements-Croome of Reading University has made it his own. The author of Creating the Productive Workplace, Clements-Croome advises companies on how to avoid sick building syndrome. He talks zealously about \"the emotional content of space\" and is evangelical about improving the quality of air in the workplace. </p> <p>\"It takes just four seconds for a single breath to travel from your nostrils to your blood supply,\" he says. \"But if the air is stuffy or polluted, you can't oxygenate that breath, so you become tired and sluggish.\" </p> <p>His research notwithstanding, the most alarming thing about the bacteria with which we share our workspaces is how little we know them. \"The biggest problem with these types of airborne chemicals is that we don't yet know the effects of long-term exposure to them,\" says Professor Vyvyan Howard, a toxicologist at Liverpool University. \"They are pernicious because you breathe them in but then the body doesn't get rid of them. They are fat-soluble and persistent - our bodies retain the toxic chemicals. If you're a woman and become pregnant, experiments have shown you pass a dose to your child. In the past 20 years, there's been a 60-fold increase in these compounds in breast milk - and in the last five years the figure has doubled.\" </p> <p>Likely effects of exposure can include skin rashes, allergic reactions akin to hay fever, tiredness and flu-like symptoms. So far the only known way to alleviate the effects is really vigorous ventilation - not exactly a speciality of most British offices. </p> <p>When companies ask Clements-Croome about the ideal office space, he sends them to Japan, to the Kajima building in Tokyo. There they have an atrium filled with birdsong and a scented garden. \"There's music, but it's not constant - human beings like contrast and change. From time to time, people walk by and offer trays of refreshments. You don't order from a cafeteria, they just bring you things so you feel cared for. </p> <p>\"The mistake architects make when designing office spaces is that they appeal only to the aesthetic. Office environments need to stimulate all five senses in a harmonious way. That means providing a good amount of natural light, nice smells and no jarring background noise. Touch is often forgotten - we need to be surrounded by natural surfaces such as glass, wood and stone.\" </p> <p>That's all very well for moneyed multinationals moving into new premises, but even companies stuck with decrepit buildings can go a long way to creating a healthy environment. \"All companies should provide alternative spaces where workers can take breaks,\" Clements-Croome says. \"A coffee break is of no use. Generally, we work in two-hour cycles, then we feel a dip because our brain is asking us to do something else. Rather than be inactive, we need to be stimulated in a different way - by listening to music, meditating, taking exercise or having a massage.\" </p> <p>Even the most expensive office technology may contribute to the problem, rather than alleviate it. \"As human beings, we have a deep desire to control our environment,\" Clements-Croome says. \"If the windows are locked because of the air conditioning, that will create resentment and depression among workers.\" </p> <p>A glimpse of what the future may hold is to be had at Home, a new London-based firm of estate agents. Oak floorboards have replaced depressing carpet tiles; there are TV screens built into corrugated iron, leather armchairs, poodle-hair upholstery and a help-yourself jelly- bean dispenser. The purpose, of course, is to sell houses, but there is more to it than that, according to Rosalyn Dexter, Home's \"design and ergonomics consultant\". (She avoids the term \"feng shui\" because firms are increasingly suspicious of it, she says.) </p> <p>\"Our workspaces are constantly subliminally sending messages to us and that has an impact on our health and wellbeing,\" Dexter says. \"You don't want offices to be Zen-like and calm, they need to stimulate creativity and productivity, and design can do that. Artwork, symbolism and colour can help - empty walls are very negative.\" </p> <p>The positioning of desks can create subtle hierarchies, she argues - power divisions in open-plan offices that can cause stress among workers if not managed properly. The confrontational opposition of desks so common in contemporary offices is a particularly bad idea. \"We all bring emotional stuff to our desks,\" she says. \"We don't need to be dealing with other people's emotions over them.\" </p> <p>Yet the best advice may ultimately be the most old-fashioned: plenty of plants (especially spider plants, which help oxidise the air) and plenty of happy photographs. Not that these need to be the traditional gallery of spouse, family or friends. \"A great trick is to put pictures up all around your desk of the things you want to buy or achieve through your job,\" Dexter says. \"One chap I worked with in a City firm had large photos of his dream place in the sun.

      "byline": "Daniel Taylor  in Eindhoven",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>On the journey from the airport to their opulent retreat yesterday, Manchester United's team coach bypassed a barbed-wire enclave situated in some of Holland's richest woodland. Sir Alex Ferguson must have winced at the sight. </p> <p>It was here at PSV's training ground that Ruud van Nistelrooy's \u00a319m transfer to Old Trafford was infamously brought to its knees in April. And it was the fallout, the mudslinging from both camps, which ensures that even with rooftop heaters in the Philips stadium and Dwight Yorke unexpectedly restored to United's team, tonight's subplot has got more than a few people hot under the collar. </p> <p>Soon after landing Ferguson reiterated his intention to bring Van Nistelrooy to United, provided the Holland striker fully recovers from the cruciate ligament injury suffered in a game of headers five months ago. Whether PSV will offer service with a smile or a snarl remains to be seen. </p> <p>When United's manager contacted Van Nistelrooy last month and invited the 24-year-old to train with them throughout October the lack of a courtesy call to PSV prompted a spiky response from the Dutch champions. </p> <p>Harry van Raaij, the club's president, went as far as to query whether Ferguson thought he was \"the king of football\", so there was no red carpet for United's manager yesterday, just the residue of a red mist. \"I've confiscated Ruud's phone to stop United reaching him,\" volunteered PSV's coach Eric Gerets. </p> <p>But Gerets has grudgingly accepted that his prize asset is inching towards following Jaap Stam to Old Trafford. \"Ruud's doing as well as we could have expected,\" he said. \"Hopefully he will be fit by March or April and still be playing for us next season. But I can't say for certain. </p> <p>\"The one thing he keeps stressing is there is no point him joining a club like United if he is not 100% right. If he is going to go, I personally think he would be better to leave at the end of next season.\" But, he added, United \"may want him sooner than that.\" </p> <p>Van Nistelrooy is increasingly optimistic of returning for the late season. He was building up the strength in his legs with a two-hour swimming session yesterday and has imposed his own media ban. </p> <p>United may err on the side of caution, however, as the financial risk would be too great for a deal to be resurrected before another year. \"The boy has had a very serious injury,\" said Ferguson. \"We will have to wait and see how he comes through.\" </p> <p>While Van Nistelrooy will be a spectator tonight , Yorke has the chance to work up a head of steam for all the right reasons. </p> <p>After learning he did not merit a place even on the bench against Chelsea on Saturday, the piqued Trinidad and Tobago international went off in a huff and, to the intense irritation of his manager, was at home in Alderley Edge before kick-off.

      "bodyText": "On the journey from the airport to their opulent retreat yesterday, Manchester United's team coach bypassed a barbed-wire enclave situated in some of Holland's richest woodland. Sir Alex Ferguson must have winced at the sight. It was here at PSV's training ground that Ruud van Nistelrooy's \u00a319m transfer to Old Trafford was infamously brought to its knees in April. And it was the fallout, the mudslinging from both camps, which ensures that even with rooftop heaters in the Philips stadium and Dwight Yorke unexpectedly restored to United's team, tonight's subplot has got more than a few people hot under the collar. Soon after landing Ferguson reiterated his intention to bring Van Nistelrooy to United, provided the Holland striker fully recovers from the cruciate ligament injury suffered in a game of headers five months ago. Whether PSV will offer service with a smile or a snarl remains to be seen. When United's manager contacted Van Nistelrooy last month and invited the 24-year-old to train with them throughout October the lack of a courtesy call to PSV prompted a spiky response from the Dutch champions. Harry van Raaij, the club's president, went as far as to query whether Ferguson thought he was \"the king of football\", so there was no red carpet for United's manager yesterday, just the residue of a red mist. \"I've confiscated Ruud's phone to stop United reaching him,\" volunteered PSV's coach Eric Gerets. But Gerets has grudgingly accepted that his prize asset is inching towards following Jaap Stam to Old Trafford. \"Ruud's doing as well as we could have expected,\" he said. \"Hopefully he will be fit by March or April and still be playing for us next season. But I can't say for certain. \"The one thing he keeps stressing is there is no point him joining a club like United if he is not 100% right. If he is going to go, I personally think he would be better to leave at the end of next season.\" But, he added, United \"may want him sooner than that.\" Van Nistelrooy is increasingly optimistic of returning for the late season. He was building up the strength in his legs with a two-hour swimming session yesterday and has imposed his own media ban. United may err on the side of caution, however, as the financial risk would be too great for a deal to be resurrected before another year. \"The boy has had a very serious injury,\" said Ferguson. \"We will have to wait and see how he comes through.\" While Van Nistelrooy will be a spectator tonight , Yorke has the chance to work up a head of steam for all the right reasons. After learning he did not merit a place even on the bench against Chelsea on Saturday, the piqued Trinidad and Tobago international went off in a huff and, to the intense irritation of his manager, was at home in Alderley Edge before kick-off. He was given the Ferguson hairdryer treatment on Sunday morning but is suddenly back in favour. \"Yorke will play alongside Ole Solskjaer,\" said a prickly Ferguson. \"But what may or may not have happened is none of your business. I'm not discussing it.\" So Yorke earns a recall despite throwing a tantrum while, just as intriguingly, Raimond van der Gouw will keep his place despite throwing in a goal. One wonders whether Mark Bosnich will ever get the chance to prove his point. Ferguson made his own point about player fatigue yesterday and, with one eye on Sunday's match at Highbury, plans to rest several players against a side who, along with Yorke, may have benefited from a weekend's rest. \"It shows you the difference in preparation between English sides and teams on the continent,\" said Ferguson. \"They don't have to play the weekend before the Champions League, while we have so many matches to fit in there is no room to manoeuvre. All the English clubs in Europe make the same case every year but nothing is ever done about it. \"We've got a lot of tired players and I will have to rest some rather than risk them getting injuries.\" Van Nistelrooy would concur with that. \u0095 Teams in the Champions League will earn bigger shares of the estimated \u00a3350m pot that last year's competition grossed, according to Uefa. Three-quarters will be passed to the 32 clubs, while a quarter is retained by Uefa for overheads and development programmes. Manchester United (probable, 4-4-2): Van der Gouw; Irwin, Brown, Johnsen, Silvestre; Beckham, Keane, Butt, Giggs; Solksjaer, Yorke. PSV Eindhoven (probable, 4-4-2): Waterreus; Van der Weerden, Nikiforov, Hofland, Heintze; Van der Doelen, Van Bommel, Vogel, Bouma; Kezman, Bruggink. Referee : M Merk (Germany) .",

      "bodyText": "Teams PSV Eindhoven: 23-Ronald Waterreus; 13-Chris van der Weerden, 21-Yuri Nikiforov, 29-Kevin Hofland, 5-Jan Heintze; 6-Mark van Bommel, 14-Johann Vogel, 17-Bjorn van der Doelen, 22-Wilfred Bouma; 9-Mateja Kezman, 10-Arnold Bruggink. Manchester United: 17-Raimond Van Der Gouw; 24-Wes Brown, 2-Gary Neville, 27-Mikael Silvestre, 12-Philip Neville; 16-Roy Keane, 18-Paul Scholes, 8-Nicky Butt, 34-Jonathan Greening; 19-Dwight Yorke, 20-Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Referee: Markus Merk (Germany) 1 United, playing in blue, kick off with PSV fans screaming their support to ensure Alex Ferguson's men do not settle too quickly. 2 Penalty shocker Solskjaer, through on goal, is brought down by PSV keeper Waterreus, who gets a yellow card for his trouble. Scholes steps up and fires into the top left corner to set up a dream start for United. PSV Eindhoven 0 - 1 Manchester United. 5 PSV fans suddenly quiet until Heintze gets away on the left; he looks up and finds Bouma to the left of the United area, but his header goes straight across the face of goal. 7 United come close to getting a second when Greening on the left finds Solskjaer on the far side of the six-yard box; Solskjaer knocks the ball down for Yorke to drag his shot wide of the far post. 10 United in control unitl they concede a corner to PSV on the left. Bruggink takes but the van der Gouw charges out to clear. 12 PSV comes alive as Kezman shoots from just inside the area - goes wide by a couple of feet. 14 PSV win a free-kick deep on the right after Silvestre checks Kezman in full flow. Bruggink takes but United clear with ease. 16 Heintze again gets away on the left after some sloppy ball control by United, but his cross is no threat for United. 17 GOAL PSV Eindhoven 1 - 1 Manchester United A piercing pass from the PSV half finds Kezman running on to the United area; he beats Silvestre and Brown and then centres, but van Bommel has overrun the ball and cannot make the pass count. United clear, but PSV counter again. Bruggink knocks on a high through ball into the path of Bouma and the flag stays down as he gets away from a dozing Phil Neville, who is trying to tug him down - far corner from 15 yards, crisp and sweet shot. 24 Not surprisingly, the crowd are now in full voice and United have lost most of their early momentum. 25 PSV again try to break down the left and Bruggink is unlucky to be caught offside when chasing a 40-yard pass. 28 United enjoy good possession on the edge of the PSV area as they seek to find a way through, but the Dutch side sit tight and eventually clear. 29 Phil Neville concedes a corner. Bruggink takes and van der Gouw punches clear. 30 Dodgy moment for United as Silvestre struggles to keep up with his man on the edge of the United area, before van der Gouw is forced to come out and clear with his feet. 33 The left flank is proving fertile territory for the home side as a swift exchange of passes sees PSV away again. Bouma crosses from deep with Bruggink and Kezman waiting, but United feet get there first. 35 PSV in full flow now as Bruggink charges into the area, but he is muscled off the ball by three United defenders. PSV play it straight back to Kezman on the right but his cross finds no-one. 36 Kezman goes down in the area under pressure from Brown - play on says the man in black. 38 GOAL PSV Eindhoven 2 - 1 Manchester United Classic counter from PSV. United lose possession deep in the PSV half. Kezman gets away on the left of midfield and drifts inside before sliding a perfectly weighted pass through to van Bommel just outside the area. Van Bommel runs on a couple of yards, pauses, looks up and then slots it through the legs of a splayed van der Gouw with his right foot. 42 United desperately need some width to prevent PSV coming forward and it will be interesting to see how Alex Ferguson approaches the second half. 44 PSV play keep-ball for a couple of minutes as the first half draws to close. 45 One extra minute to play as United look for that equaliser - lots of movement but little substance in the end as Solskjaer is muscled off the ball on the edge of the area. Half-time. Not a great half for United. After a lively start, they had trouble containing PSV on the flanks and completely failed to do themselves justice. 46 No changes in personnel as the second half gets underway. 47 United pass it around interminably deep on the right but fail to find a way through. 48 A golden chance for PSV as United again fall foul of their own intended offside trap. A quick knock-on from a long ball finds Kezman just outside the area, but he drags his shot wide of the far post. 52 Van der Doelen creates havoc on the edge of the United area as he slides the ball through to Kezman on the right side. Kezman turns and shoots wide of the far post. 55 United free-kick just over 20 yards out and to the right. Scholes takes towards Keane coming in at the far post, but everyone misses it. 56 Brown gives away a free-kick 40 yards out; PSV try to work it in from the right, but United clear. 58 Beckham, Giggs and Sheringham start to warm up on the touchline, despite Alex Ferguson's stated intention not to play them if at all possible. 59 Evenly matched so far, which means United are no nearer to finding an equaliser. 63 Van der Doelen the man who is holding up United at the moment as United pressure the PSV goal. 64 GOAL PSV Eindhoven 3 - 1 Manchester United Well, there you go. Another classic counter attack. In no time at all, the ball reaches Kezman deep on the right; he looks up and beats van der Gouw with a firece shot to the far post from the right side of the area. 65 Mr Sitter from PSV.

Substitutions Beckham, Giggs and Wallwork on for Scholes, Greening and Silvestre. United pull out the stops in an attempt to save the game. 72 PSV free-kick 30 yards out and to the left.

      "body": "<p>After the opening three matches in the Primera Liga, it's not big-spending Barcelona or Real Madrid who top the table. It's Celta Vigo. </p> <p>But Victor Fernandez's unfashionable side deserve their position after maintaining their 100 per cent record with a 1-0 victory at home to Espanyol.</p> <p>The visitors started the brighter, with Manel's deflected shot producing a brilliant save from Jose Pinto. But it wasn't long before Celta - inspired by their Brazilian signings Doriva, Catanha and Vagner and their Russian playmaker Alexander Mostovoi - started to work over the Espanyol defence.</p> <p>Catanha, who joined from Malaga during the summer for \u00a37m, should have opening the scoring after 15 minutes, but he tripped over the ball. Five minutes later, however, he made no mistake. </p> <p>Recent Chelsea target Gustavo Lopez did most of the work, cutting and twisting his way past challenge after challenge before unleashing a powerful shot that the keeper could only parry into the path of Catanha, who slotted home from six-yards. </p> <p>Celta continued to dominate with Catanha always dangerous and Mostovoi mischievous. However they couldn't add a second - and towards the end Espanyol nearly made them pay, with Pinto and Posse both going close.</p> <p>Barcelona, who had been thrashed by Athletico Bilbao and Besiktas in their previous two games, returned to winning ways with a comprehensive 3-1 victory over Racing Santander.

      "bodyText": "After the opening three matches in the Primera Liga, it's not big-spending Barcelona or Real Madrid who top the table. It's Celta Vigo. But Victor Fernandez's unfashionable side deserve their position after maintaining their 100 per cent record with a 1-0 victory at home to Espanyol. The visitors started the brighter, with Manel's deflected shot producing a brilliant save from Jose Pinto. But it wasn't long before Celta - inspired by their Brazilian signings Doriva, Catanha and Vagner and their Russian playmaker Alexander Mostovoi - started to work over the Espanyol defence. Catanha, who joined from Malaga during the summer for \u00a37m, should have opening the scoring after 15 minutes, but he tripped over the ball. Five minutes later, however, he made no mistake. Recent Chelsea target Gustavo Lopez did most of the work, cutting and twisting his way past challenge after challenge before unleashing a powerful shot that the keeper could only parry into the path of Catanha, who slotted home from six-yards. Celta continued to dominate with Catanha always dangerous and Mostovoi mischievous. However they couldn't add a second - and towards the end Espanyol nearly made them pay, with Pinto and Posse both going close. Barcelona, who had been thrashed by Athletico Bilbao and Besiktas in their previous two games, returned to winning ways with a comprehensive 3-1 victory over Racing Santander. After some slothful early finishing, Barca finally went ahead in the 32nd minute when Simao caressed in a cross from the right and Kluivert cleverly lofted the ball over Ceballos and into the net. The Dutch striker then doubled his tally in the 56th minute when De la Pena's pass set up Rivaldo, whose exquisite backheel split the Racing defence and played in Kluivert, who scored from 10 yards. Five minutes later, Racing pulled one back with a brilliant free-kick from Espina, and the Nou Camp started to sweat.

The Stop the Eleven Plus campaign in Kent, which has 33 of England's 165 grammar schools, more than any other county, accused Mr Blunkett of erecting \"too many unfair and undemocratic hurdles for us to jump over\". Last year they suspended their campaign after winning only around 7,000 of the 46,000 petition signatures needed - 20% of eligible parents - to trigger a full ballot in Kent. Activists complained that under revised guidance issued this autumn, it is even harder to ensure a ballot takes place. Though the Electoral Reform Society now has to approve the wording of the petition, schools are still prevented from distributing petition forms. The forms have to be distributed by campaigners. Once the ballot is triggered, schools can send out leaflets produced by campaigners - but only if both sides want to put their case. If pro-selection campaigners do not want to send out a leaflet, schools cannot send out just one side of the argument. Rebecca Matthews, chair of the campaign, said: \"Is David Blunkett going to continue to look the other way, wring his hands and say the 11-plus is bad -- but do nothing? \"I want Mr Blunkett to tell us why he has deliberately engineered a situation where a quarter of a million children in Kent continue to have their education blighted by the 11-plus.\" The decision will be officially announced at a fringe meeting held by the Campaign for State Education (CASE) at the Labour conference in Brighton, which will be critical of the government's policy on selection. Lord Hattersley, Labour's former deputy leader, will tell the meeting: \"The evidence leaves no room for doubt. Comprehensive education has proved a remarkable success. Yet comprehensive schools are continually denigrated by the prime minister - often in language which suggests that he has no idea how selective schools are organised and run. \"During the 18 years of Tory government we could all console ourselves that once Labour was elected things would get better. But the hard truth is that as far as comprehensive education is concerned that they have got worse. Despite David Blunkett's promise - \"no selection by examination or interview\" - there is more selection now than there was on the day he became secretary of state for education.\" Margaret Tulloch, spokesperson for CASE, said: \"Ending selection is too important an issue to be left to the possibility or otherwise of a local campaign being able to collect large numbers of signatures before anything can change.\" Anti-selection campaigners in Birmingham are to proceed with their efforts to get 10,000 signatures to ensure a ballot on the future of six grammar schools in the city and two in Sutton Coldfield. Another campaign is afoot in Buckinghamshire, which has 13 grammar schools, though it was unclear last night whether Kent's decision would affect them. But ministers will be relieved that they will be spared at least one provocative petition on selection, which they feared could harm Labour's image in middle Britain, in the run-up to the general election. Mr Blunkett has said he is not interested in \"hunting grammar schools\". A DfEE spokeswoman said the petition forms will be produced by the Electoral Reform Society to prevent any possible fraud. The spokeswoman said the decision to drop the petition was \"a matter for the petition organisers themselves. They are free to stop their activities at any time.\"",

Classics Pages **** Aimed at: everyone Although this site is intended for classics pupils, it provides an engaging introduction to the lives and thought of some key Greek and Roman thinkers, so it will be invaluable if you want to introduce a class to a particular philosopher before tackling his ideas. The Atheism Web **** Aimed at: everyone An excellent introduction to constructing logical arguments, together with an intriguing list of common fallacies. The Argument Clinic *** Aimed at: everyone Submit an argument to the clinic and have it criticised by staff at the University of Northern Colorado. Philosophy Comix **** Aimed at: (in practice) teachers To know how a Garfield cartoon can convey conversational implications, look here. The cartoons would make a good primary source for lessons. Blackwell's Resources **** Aimed at: everyone An excellent selection of resources from different parts of the web. Internet Encyclopaedia **** Aimed at: everyone A concise, though slightly dry, introduction to key thinkers and concepts.

      "byline": "Phil Daoust",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Daryl Hannah is looking fantastic: clear skin, sparkly eyes, glossy hair, not a day over 30, though she's just months away from the big four-oh. She's pale, but then she always has been. Let's just say that she shines . You'd never guess that a couple of hours ago she was throwing up in a theatre toilet. </p> <p>\"It's the second day I've been ill in a fortnight,\" she says. \"All I've eaten today is a banana, and I couldn't even keep that down.\" She gulps and looks worried. Perhaps I do too, because she leans over and touches me on the elbow. \"You won't catch it,\" she says with exaggerated concern. \"I promise I won't kiss you.\" </p> <p>Hannah has spent the afternoon rehearsing George Axelrod's 1950s comedy The Seven Year Itch, not just her West End debut but her first ever stage role. With a week to go until previews, rumours are flying. The producer has hinted she may strip off to play the lusted-after girl-next-door, and some imaginative soul has claimed that Hannah is \"channeling\" the ghost of Marilyn Monroe, who played the same part in Billy Wilder's film version. Not only is the deceased blonde bombshell giving Hannah hints about her acting; she's telling her the winning lottery numbers. </p> <p>After the frenzy over Nicole Kidman baring all for theatregoers in The Blue Room, followed by Kathleen Turner and Jerry Hall in The Graduate, Hannah knows there's no chance of the critics forgetting to turn up on her first night. \"Everyone keeps warning me,\" she says. \" 'In England they're so mean. They're so hard-core. The press is out of control.' Everyone says I shouldn't even bother reading the reviews because they're so horrible.\" </p> <p>So is it nerves that are making her ill? There was never any question of her appearing naked, she says: that suggestion was just \"a cheap and cheesy way to sell tickets\". But she feels exposed all the same. \"Being in front of an audience for the first time will be the scariest thing. I just hope I get through it and don't embarrass anybody. I missed a whole section of the script during the run-through today. What if that happens in a week's time? What if I freeze or panic?\" She has prescribed herself ginkgo biloba to improve her memory, but says she keeps forgetting to take it. </p> <p>She doesn't seem paralysed by the danger - more anxious and thrilled, like someone watching a horror movie. But still. With more than 30 films under her belt, why did she want to try her luck on stage? \"I'm not sure I did really,\" she says. She was talked into it by the play's director, Mike Radford, who had just finished bossing her around in Dancing at the Blue Iguana, his recently completed movie about strippers. \"I was so honoured that he wanted to work with me so soon afterwards. But I still said no. Then I realised this might be the only time I'll ever have the chance to do something like this.\" </p> <p>Does she go to the theatre a lot? \"Not that often,\" she admits. </p> <p>When Hannah was a teenager, she couldn't even get into the high-school play. Now she's the show's main selling point. The posters have just gone up on Shaftesbury Avenue: there she is in profile, looking unusually buxom in an underwired bra. \"Yeah,\" she says, gesturing towards her breasts. \"A much more 1950s shape. I really have a sort of boy's figure.\" As a kid she was known as Broomstick. </p> <p>She makes this West End business sound very spur-of-the-moment. But Hannah has being trying to reinvent herself since the early 1990s. Her first big role, in Ridley Scott's 1982 movie Blade Runner, cast her as a homicidal android sex slave and won her a certain cult following; but she really made her name two years later in Splash, Ron Howard's charming updating of the Little Mermaid story, which stuck her in a fish tail opposite Tom Hanks. Oliver Stone put her in Wall Street (1987), his study of capitalist greed, Steve Martin wooed her in the romantic comedy Roxanne (1987), and she even got a chance to act dowdy alongside Dolly Parton in Steel Magnolias (1989). But she was heading for a string of forgettable features and kooky comic eye-candydom. Just the title of her 1993 telemovie tells all you need to know: Attack of the 50ft Woman. </p> <p>By the early 1990s she was known more for her boyfriends than her career. After a violent argument to which the police were called, she left the rock singer Jackson Browne and began a relationship with John F Kennedy Jr that was to last three years. She would never talk about it, but that didn't stop the speculation about pregnancy, impending marriage and Jacqueline Kennedy's fury/ indifference/delight about her son's actress girlfriend. When a passer-by filmed the couple kissing on their doorstep for an impressive 16 minutes, the footage was broadcast coast to coast. </p> <p>She's obviously bright, but it wasn't her brain that was used to promote her movies. \"I would only do photoshoots, because I was too afraid to talk in person on TV, and they'd always dress me up like some glamourpuss.

      "bodyText": "Daryl Hannah is looking fantastic: clear skin, sparkly eyes, glossy hair, not a day over 30, though she's just months away from the big four-oh. She's pale, but then she always has been. Let's just say that she shines . You'd never guess that a couple of hours ago she was throwing up in a theatre toilet. \"It's the second day I've been ill in a fortnight,\" she says. \"All I've eaten today is a banana, and I couldn't even keep that down.\" She gulps and looks worried. Perhaps I do too, because she leans over and touches me on the elbow. \"You won't catch it,\" she says with exaggerated concern. \"I promise I won't kiss you.\" Hannah has spent the afternoon rehearsing George Axelrod's 1950s comedy The Seven Year Itch, not just her West End debut but her first ever stage role. With a week to go until previews, rumours are flying. The producer has hinted she may strip off to play the lusted-after girl-next-door, and some imaginative soul has claimed that Hannah is \"channeling\" the ghost of Marilyn Monroe, who played the same part in Billy Wilder's film version. Not only is the deceased blonde bombshell giving Hannah hints about her acting; she's telling her the winning lottery numbers. After the frenzy over Nicole Kidman baring all for theatregoers in The Blue Room, followed by Kathleen Turner and Jerry Hall in The Graduate, Hannah knows there's no chance of the critics forgetting to turn up on her first night. \"Everyone keeps warning me,\" she says. \" 'In England they're so mean. They're so hard-core. The press is out of control.' Everyone says I shouldn't even bother reading the reviews because they're so horrible.\" So is it nerves that are making her ill? There was never any question of her appearing naked, she says: that suggestion was just \"a cheap and cheesy way to sell tickets\". But she feels exposed all the same. \"Being in front of an audience for the first time will be the scariest thing. I just hope I get through it and don't embarrass anybody. I missed a whole section of the script during the run-through today. What if that happens in a week's time? What if I freeze or panic?\" She has prescribed herself ginkgo biloba to improve her memory, but says she keeps forgetting to take it. She doesn't seem paralysed by the danger - more anxious and thrilled, like someone watching a horror movie. But still. With more than 30 films under her belt, why did she want to try her luck on stage? \"I'm not sure I did really,\" she says. She was talked into it by the play's director, Mike Radford, who had just finished bossing her around in Dancing at the Blue Iguana, his recently completed movie about strippers. \"I was so honoured that he wanted to work with me so soon afterwards. But I still said no. Then I realised this might be the only time I'll ever have the chance to do something like this.\" Does she go to the theatre a lot? \"Not that often,\" she admits. When Hannah was a teenager, she couldn't even get into the high-school play. Now she's the show's main selling point. The posters have just gone up on Shaftesbury Avenue: there she is in profile, looking unusually buxom in an underwired bra. \"Yeah,\" she says, gesturing towards her breasts. \"A much more 1950s shape. I really have a sort of boy's figure.\" As a kid she was known as Broomstick. She makes this West End business sound very spur-of-the-moment. But Hannah has being trying to reinvent herself since the early 1990s. Her first big role, in Ridley Scott's 1982 movie Blade Runner, cast her as a homicidal android sex slave and won her a certain cult following; but she really made her name two years later in Splash, Ron Howard's charming updating of the Little Mermaid story, which stuck her in a fish tail opposite Tom Hanks. Oliver Stone put her in Wall Street (1987), his study of capitalist greed, Steve Martin wooed her in the romantic comedy Roxanne (1987), and she even got a chance to act dowdy alongside Dolly Parton in Steel Magnolias (1989). But she was heading for a string of forgettable features and kooky comic eye-candydom. Just the title of her 1993 telemovie tells all you need to know: Attack of the 50ft Woman. By the early 1990s she was known more for her boyfriends than her career. After a violent argument to which the police were called, she left the rock singer Jackson Browne and began a relationship with John F Kennedy Jr that was to last three years. She would never talk about it, but that didn't stop the speculation about pregnancy, impending marriage and Jacqueline Kennedy's fury/ indifference/delight about her son's actress girlfriend. When a passer-by filmed the couple kissing on their doorstep for an impressive 16 minutes, the footage was broadcast coast to coast. She's obviously bright, but it wasn't her brain that was used to promote her movies. \"I would only do photoshoots, because I was too afraid to talk in person on TV, and they'd always dress me up like some glamourpuss. But that's not really who I am.\" Sitting in a restaurant booth in her T-shirt and denim jacket, a large fake-fur shoulderbag beside her, she looks more like a midwestern teen. \"I don't like to be a ball-breaker, you see. It's in my nature to be a little acquiescent.\" With many of her movies, she knew before filming was over that she'd never want to watch them. \"I always took the best of what I got offered,\" she says with a smile, \"but most of it was crap.\" She doesn't sound bitter about it, but she's not the ranting sort. \"I come from Chicago, and people from there tend to be pretty grounded.

      "body": "<p><strong> Plagued by facial hair</strong></p> <p> I am 36 years old and since I was 22 I have been growing unnatural facial hair, first on the chin and, after I had children, on the neck and the side of the cheeks. To get rid of it I've tried everything from threading to bleaching to tweezing, but the results, especially for the chin, are not satisfactory. I am now thinking of laser treatment, but I am not sure whether it is completely safe and whether the results will be satisfactory, especially since it is so expensive. Also, could this problem have its root in an hormone imbalance, and, if so, how could I find out? </p> <p>\u0095 Your recent growth of facial hair probably does represent a change in your hormonal balance, which is a common phenomenon after childbirth and as you get older. Losing excess weight can affect hormonal levels and make hair growth less severe. The contraceptive pill Dianette is a good option if you need contraception, can take the pill and want to help acne and excess hair. Laser hair removal requires several treatments, can leave permanent marks and cannot guarantee that the hair won't regrow. Some women I've spoken to have been delighted with the result, others have been rather disappointed. It's not available on the NHS and the best way of tracking own a reliable laser clinic near you is to ask a consulant dermatologist to whom your GP can refer you. </p> <p><strong> I'm missing a beat</strong> </p> <p> I experience frequent \"missed\" heartbeats, particularly when feeling tired or ill or just under the weather. I have had an ECG and a chest x-ray, and my GP assures me that these are ectopic beats, and are nothing to worry about. However they can occur up to a dozen times a minute, and feel very alarming. Can you explain what they are, and what causes them. </p> <p>\u0095 Missed heartbeats are actually due to an extra heartbeat followed by a prolonged period of resting by the heart in which it feels as though you've missed a beat! An extra beat every so often may be disconcerting, but is not usually part of a dangerous condition. The ECG can distinguish between the different patterns of extra heartbeats and other disturbances of the rhythm of the heart. The harmless type you have is known as extrasystole and can be exacerbated by stress and caffeine, but gets better when you exercise. If it is causing you concern or discomfort, you could see a cardiologist who may order other tests such as a 24-hour ECG to pick up any other rhythm disturbances that the one-off ECG may have missed. </p> <p><strong> Itchy nipples</strong> </p> <p> I 've had extremely sore nipples in the last week which have been weeping and itchy. I can't feel any lumps in my breasts but I'm very worried about the problem. I'm 24. </p> <p>\u0095 Two likely causes come to mind; if you've started running or jogging recently, it may be that your nipples may be rubbing against your top and are becoming irritated by the friction. A well-padded sports bra and Vaseline on the nipples sorts that out. The other possibility is that you've changed your soap powder and that soap residues in your clothes are irritating the skin of your nipples. Washing your clothes in a non-biological, hypo-allergenic powder should prevent a recurrence and 1% hydrocortisone cream on the nipples will sooth the irritation. I would see your GP if it doesn't clear up within a week. </p> <p>\u0095 These answers are intended to be as accurate and full as possible, but should never be used as a substitute for visiting a doctor and seeking medical help. If you have a question for Dr Robinson, email <a href=\"mailto:drann@dircon.co.uk\">drann@dircon.co.uk</a> or write to her c/o The Health Editor, The Guardian, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER.

      "bodyText": "Plagued by facial hair I am 36 years old and since I was 22 I have been growing unnatural facial hair, first on the chin and, after I had children, on the neck and the side of the cheeks. To get rid of it I've tried everything from threading to bleaching to tweezing, but the results, especially for the chin, are not satisfactory. I am now thinking of laser treatment, but I am not sure whether it is completely safe and whether the results will be satisfactory, especially since it is so expensive. Also, could this problem have its root in an hormone imbalance, and, if so, how could I find out? \u0095 Your recent growth of facial hair probably does represent a change in your hormonal balance, which is a common phenomenon after childbirth and as you get older. Losing excess weight can affect hormonal levels and make hair growth less severe. The contraceptive pill Dianette is a good option if you need contraception, can take the pill and want to help acne and excess hair. Laser hair removal requires several treatments, can leave permanent marks and cannot guarantee that the hair won't regrow. Some women I've spoken to have been delighted with the result, others have been rather disappointed. It's not available on the NHS and the best way of tracking own a reliable laser clinic near you is to ask a consulant dermatologist to whom your GP can refer you. I'm missing a beat I experience frequent \"missed\" heartbeats, particularly when feeling tired or ill or just under the weather. I have had an ECG and a chest x-ray, and my GP assures me that these are ectopic beats, and are nothing to worry about. However they can occur up to a dozen times a minute, and feel very alarming. Can you explain what they are, and what causes them. \u0095 Missed heartbeats are actually due to an extra heartbeat followed by a prolonged period of resting by the heart in which it feels as though you've missed a beat! An extra beat every so often may be disconcerting, but is not usually part of a dangerous condition. The ECG can distinguish between the different patterns of extra heartbeats and other disturbances of the rhythm of the heart. The harmless type you have is known as extrasystole and can be exacerbated by stress and caffeine, but gets better when you exercise. If it is causing you concern or discomfort, you could see a cardiologist who may order other tests such as a 24-hour ECG to pick up any other rhythm disturbances that the one-off ECG may have missed. Itchy nipples I 've had extremely sore nipples in the last week which have been weeping and itchy. I can't feel any lumps in my breasts but I'm very worried about the problem. I'm 24. \u0095 Two likely causes come to mind; if you've started running or jogging recently, it may be that your nipples may be rubbing against your top and are becoming irritated by the friction. A well-padded sports bra and Vaseline on the nipples sorts that out. The other possibility is that you've changed your soap powder and that soap residues in your clothes are irritating the skin of your nipples. Washing your clothes in a non-biological, hypo-allergenic powder should prevent a recurrence and 1% hydrocortisone cream on the nipples will sooth the irritation. I would see your GP if it doesn't clear up within a week. \u0095 These answers are intended to be as accurate and full as possible, but should never be used as a substitute for visiting a doctor and seeking medical help. If you have a question for Dr Robinson, email drann@dircon.co.uk or write to her c/o The Health Editor, The Guardian, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER.

Plenty of chat and the right stimuli as babies will make them more intelligent in later life; cruel words or neglect may land them in therapy or turn them into criminal delinquents. Smoking and alcohol are well known health risk factors for babies. A deficiency in folic acid in the first few weeks of a foetus's life can cause neural damage and even spina bifida... and so on. </p> <p>Now, a spate of research into the effects of diet on a woman at about the time of conception is ladling on yet more guilt before she even gets to shag the dad. It seems that a woman's health and diet in the hours before and after conception - before she may even realise she's pregnant - appears to have a profound affect on her baby's long-term health. </p> <p>Research findings from the University of Southampton, released last week, suggest that female rats briefly starved of protein shortly after conception have offspring with a higher rate of defects. Their female offspring are underweight at birth, while the males have high blood pressure, shrunken livers and enlarged kidneys. Research at Queen's University in Belfast, also released last week, suggests that the official advice of four units of alcohol per week for pregnant women may be under-cautious, for the mildest tipple may affect the foetus's nervous system. Research at St Thomas's Hospital in London, released earlier this month, seemed to show that eating too much fat and too little protein can create cardiovascular disease, regardless of how healthily the child lives after birth. Yet more research, from the University of North Carolina, has shown that gum disease can be as harmful to an unborn child as smoking regularly, for women with severe gum disease are seven times more likely to have a premature baby with low birth weight than those without. </p> <p>Then there is the rather thorny issue of toxins - harmful chemicals in the environment, pesticides, additives and hormones in our food - that build up in a woman's fat tissues over the years and get passed onto the foetus through the placenta and to the baby in breast milk. According to the World Health Organisation, people should ingest a maximum of 10 nanograms of polychlorinated chemicals and dioxins a day. Yet babies in western Europe, at two months old, are taking in on average 170 nanograms a day from their mothers' milk. (Natural birth advocate Michel Odent has devised a detoxifying regime for prospective parents to maximise the health chances of their as yet unconceived child.) </p> <p>Clearly there is bound to be a link between the diet of a mother and the health and welfare of her unborn child when she is manufacturing another human being. She \"eats for two\", with the growing foetus hijacking valuable nutrients such as calcium away from the mother to ensure its own healthy development. But how are women to differentiate between what may be significant and irrelevant when they understandably do not want to do anything that may harm their unborn child? </p> <p>Firstly, the experiments on protein deficiency were carried out on rats and there is no guarantee that we behave in the same way. Secondly, most of this research has been conducted on small samples and is by no means conclusive. Thirdly, and perhaps more importantly, everything we do or consume and perhaps even feel is bound to have some sort of an effect on growing children but if we stop to analyse all this and attempt to control it we drive ourselves mad with self reproach and risk, reverting to the dark old ages of superstition. My grandmother always maintained that my mother was born with a missing ear lobe because a bullet had grazed her own ear when she was pregnant. However, that perverted gene has jumped a generation and affected one of my nieces proving, perhaps, that the cause lay elsewhere. </p> <p>Living beneath an electricity pylon or near a nuclear power plant may increase the chances of cancer. Walking through busy streets in all likelihood increases respiratory diseases and asthma. Driving a car through rush hour traffic or working in a stressful job must raise a pregnant woman's blood pressure and any form of emotional distress will provoke adrenalin in both mother and baby. But this is modern life - we cannot avoid potential dangers and live enveloped in cotton wool. It won't be long before scientists find a tenuous link between excessive consumption of chocolate biscuits and hair loss or jogging and the shape of a babies nose. Diet in pregnant women is more balanced today than it has ever been. Babies are born fatter and healthier than ever, and more survive until adulthood than ever before in history. We know more about their nutritional needs, but we still indulge them with packets of fat-laden crisps, yoghurt pots heaving with unnecessary sugar and junk food riddled with additives. How can science disentangle genetic factors and the unhealthier ways we live our lives from the effects of a pregnant woman's behaviour on her unborn child? There is no way of knowing how many health problems are genetically programmed and beyond our control or the direct result of diet in pregnancy. This thirst for research into the impact of maternal behaviour on the foetus may equip some women with greater knowledge about how best to safeguard her baby's interests but the net effect is yet more guilt, as well as an uneasy sense that one can control the whole process of reproduction. Yet so much of it is still mysterious and down to chance. </p> <p>Clearly, any woman longing for a child wants to maximise the health and safety of her unborn child. But the danger is that there is so much that is beyond her control that all she may be left with is an encroaching sense of inadequacy, and what sort of start does that give to mother and child? Mother's matter, a great deal. If this research genuinely empowered them to be better mothers without cranking up all those feelings of guilt and inadequacy then it would be genuinely useful. But we're human too - and fallible. We all need that odd drink to lift the spirits, a bag of chips or a bar of chocolate for occasional comfort, and often pregnant women smoke because life is tense and stressful rather than the calm oasis that medical researchers and natural birth activists maintain it should be.

      "body": "<p>It is all Martine McCutcheon's fault. This time last year, the \"blood group diet\" was emphatically a fringe practice - popular enough on the wilder shores of American food-faddery, perhaps, but strictly non-mainstream here. There wasn't, after all, much medical backing for the central claim of the diet's originator - a bow-tied doctor from Stamford, Connecticut called Peter D'Adamo - that your blood type holds the key to your optimum diet: that eating only those foods suited to your blood would, as D'Adamo hyperbolically put it, \"lead you back to the essential truths that live in every cell of your body and link you to your historical, evolutionary ancestry.\" </p> <p>But that was before the EastEnders star went public with her enthusiasm for the diet which, she announced, had made her \"look and feel totally different\". Elizabeth Hurley and Hugh Grant were soon reported to have followed suit, and D'Adamo's book - published in the UK as The Eat Right Diet - has enjoyed sustained success in the bestseller charts since. </p> <p>In some parts of the world - especially Japan - one's membership of blood group O, A, B or AB has long held a roughly similar status to one's star sign, a piece of information treated as essential by dating agencies and even by some recruiters. But D'Adamo (a naturopathic doctor, as opposed to a medical one) broke new ground in proposing a scientific mechanism to explain why blood type - previously of medical interest mainly for matching the donors and recipients of blood transfusions - could hold the key to nutritional health. </p> <p>The theory is bewitchingly simple. Each of the four blood types - characterised by the presence or absence of certain molecules, called antigens, on the surface of red blood cells - emerged at different stages of human evolution and so, D'Adamo argues, members of each group should stick to the foods and exercise styles prevalent at that time. Type O emerged 50,000 years ago, when hunting and gathering were dominant, so today's type Os, \"the hunters\", are best suited to a meat-heavy diet, low in dairy products, and to intense exercise.

      "bodyText": "It is all Martine McCutcheon's fault. This time last year, the \"blood group diet\" was emphatically a fringe practice - popular enough on the wilder shores of American food-faddery, perhaps, but strictly non-mainstream here. There wasn't, after all, much medical backing for the central claim of the diet's originator - a bow-tied doctor from Stamford, Connecticut called Peter D'Adamo - that your blood type holds the key to your optimum diet: that eating only those foods suited to your blood would, as D'Adamo hyperbolically put it, \"lead you back to the essential truths that live in every cell of your body and link you to your historical, evolutionary ancestry.\" But that was before the EastEnders star went public with her enthusiasm for the diet which, she announced, had made her \"look and feel totally different\". Elizabeth Hurley and Hugh Grant were soon reported to have followed suit, and D'Adamo's book - published in the UK as The Eat Right Diet - has enjoyed sustained success in the bestseller charts since. In some parts of the world - especially Japan - one's membership of blood group O, A, B or AB has long held a roughly similar status to one's star sign, a piece of information treated as essential by dating agencies and even by some recruiters. But D'Adamo (a naturopathic doctor, as opposed to a medical one) broke new ground in proposing a scientific mechanism to explain why blood type - previously of medical interest mainly for matching the donors and recipients of blood transfusions - could hold the key to nutritional health. The theory is bewitchingly simple. Each of the four blood types - characterised by the presence or absence of certain molecules, called antigens, on the surface of red blood cells - emerged at different stages of human evolution and so, D'Adamo argues, members of each group should stick to the foods and exercise styles prevalent at that time. Type O emerged 50,000 years ago, when hunting and gathering were dominant, so today's type Os, \"the hunters\", are best suited to a meat-heavy diet, low in dairy products, and to intense exercise. Type As, \"farmers\", whose blood group dates from the dawn of agriculture, should be largely vegetarian, while type B, the \"nomad\", dating from times of mass migration, is suited to most foods except wheat, shellfish, chicken and some pulses. (D'Adamo never really gets to the bottom of AB, the rarest blood group, which he labels \"the enigma\" and on which he places the fewest dietary restrictions.) In Britain, most of us are hunters: 45% of the population is type 0, 43% type A, 9% type B and just 3% type AB. Too much of the wrong foods for your blood type, D'Adamo argues, and lectins - a type of protein - in the food will cause clotting reactions in the blood, leading to obesity and numerous illnesses including irritable bowel syndrome and cirrhosis of the liver.

The BBC shows large groups of comfortable, educated protesters violently confronting and challenging the legitimacy of smaller groups of equally well-nourished trade leaders, industrialists, agency heads and finance chiefs, all over the aid or agony global capitalism brings to nations like mine.</p> <p>As one who spent three decades exiled by and agitating against a country that did not recognize my vote, I fully support dissent and the freedom to express it. As one who has spent half a decade helping lead that country, I share the frustration when dissent and expression regress from a means into merely an end, smothering the message in the process. But from both perspectives, I wonder: Why not cut out the middle men and take the debate over globalization directly to third world cities like Sri Lanka, Brazil, Egypt, or Vietnam? Why not, to make it interesting, lock both sides indoors, face to face?</p> <p>I ask these questions not to be churlish, but for three reasons: </p> <p>First, these relatively poor places are precisely where the debate on \"global development\" - defined either in terms of McDonald's and Monsanto or agricultural subsidies and debt forgiveness - matters most. Second, their impoverished people - one billion lacking reliable tap water, two billion without electricity - are those for whom both sides claim to speak with authority.

      "bodyText": "Winter: World Trade Organization riots in Seattle. Spring: World Bank/International Monetary Fund standoffs in Washington, DC. Then the May Day clashes in London and Berlin. I watch the escalating rhetoric, arrests and police crackdowns from South Africa with a touch of irony. The BBC shows large groups of comfortable, educated protesters violently confronting and challenging the legitimacy of smaller groups of equally well-nourished trade leaders, industrialists, agency heads and finance chiefs, all over the aid or agony global capitalism brings to nations like mine. As one who spent three decades exiled by and agitating against a country that did not recognize my vote, I fully support dissent and the freedom to express it. As one who has spent half a decade helping lead that country, I share the frustration when dissent and expression regress from a means into merely an end, smothering the message in the process. But from both perspectives, I wonder: Why not cut out the middle men and take the debate over globalization directly to third world cities like Sri Lanka, Brazil, Egypt, or Vietnam? Why not, to make it interesting, lock both sides indoors, face to face? I ask these questions not to be churlish, but for three reasons: First, these relatively poor places are precisely where the debate on \"global development\" - defined either in terms of McDonald's and Monsanto or agricultural subsidies and debt forgiveness - matters most. Second, their impoverished people - one billion lacking reliable tap water, two billion without electricity - are those for whom both sides claim to speak with authority. Lastly, over the past 18 months, one multinational authority tackled exactly these issues, in exactly these places, on the ground, and with surprisingly productive, nonviolent results. When chaotic protest becomes the norm in Europe and America, such pockets of calm are breaking news.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Question: So what have you been doing since getting out?</p> <p>Answer: Since I left I've been staying a lot in my flat, lying low. I've seen lots of people going out here there and everywhere and I thought, no. I just wanted to go home, and be at my home, just chill and relax.</p> <p>Question: Why did you want to do that, rather than go out and celebrate?</p> <p>Answer: I didn't want to go to those big parties you see [the other contestants] all being filmed and photographed and I thought I've had enough of that, you know, almost drove me mad for 10 weeks. Even though C4 offered security because apparently everyone\u0092s homes was being bombarded by the media... you know, ours wasn't! No one was bleeding interested! I was like: no I don't want any security, I don't want anybody at all around.</p> <p>Question: So why are the others behaving so differently? </p> <p>Answer: I think it's just so tempting, they know they're going to mingle with the stars. it's from one extreme to the other, and fair enough when I was in the house I was dreaming of going to the party and having pints and whatever. it's an extension of the personalities as well, the people who are going out, know what I mean, were the ones, even in the house, who wanted attention</p> <p>Question: This all begs the question that we were asking when we were watching it, which is, what on earth were you doing in it, cos it just didn't seem at all ..</p> <p>Answer: Me.</p> <p>Question: There was a lot of positive identification with you, but at the same time, that made us think, why does she want to be on it?</p> <p> Answer: I got carried away with the whole process, as in initially saw the Dutch programme ...and they said, if you're interested, please, you know, call us, and I was intrigued more than anything else so I thought, I'll call them. And then that happened, and then the next stage happened and then the next stage and you're like, oh my god I'm down to the last whatever, oh my god! And then finally it was like, you've been chosen and I was like, oh, I haven't even decided if I really want to do it! I wasn\u0092t on a mission to \"find myself\" or not on a mission to ... I don't know, I just got swept along with the whole thing.</p> <p> Question: And so did you have serious thoughts about whether or not you'd accept?</p> <p> Answer: Yes!I thought about it a lot. My friends were really wary of it. Tanya's sister and, you know, some of my close friends advised me not to do it. They said, they would just go over the top, you know you've been ... you've only been chose cos you're a lesbian ex-nun, and I said, I know, I know I am. I know I am. But still! They said, they're just gonna milk that, you're just interesting just for those two things. Um, and I thought, fair enough, very good point. And also ... and the press would be wicked, in a nasty kind of way. Which actually they weren't. I was just so surprised, we're just really pleased about. And I knew Tanya would go mad if I was away for 9 weeks.</p> <p>Question: What in the end convinced you?</p> <p>Answer: It's so appealing, being on television 24 hours a day, people know it was sick, it was like, attraction to something perverse! [Laughs] And, er, and that's why I did it, I thought ... I actually thought at the end of the day, you know, I dunno, the reasons why people were saying not to do it, like, you're gay, your family ... you know, you're a lesbian and it's going to make bad press, and I thought, well, that's not a reason not to do it. That's, you know, if I really want to do it I should do it, and just be a bit ballsy about it. Shouldn't stop, cos it would stop other people from applying, if there was a lesbian or a gay man who, you know, wasn't totally secure and comfortable about themselves, you know, that would put a lot of people off and I thought, no, I'll just do it. Just do it. But yes, I had doubts. It was just me going through it myself. Shall I do it or should I not do it. All the time. What about my family, what ... what will I get out of it, it's going to probably be a big flop, the s how, anyway, it's probably going to be, oh, cameramen touching theirselves behind the wall! Well all these things go through your head.</p> <p> Question: Was Tanya supportive at the end, when you decided that you going to do it?</p> <p> Answer: She was. Yeah. Absolutely. She was.</p> <p> Question: I was interested in the whole Tanya thing because we hadn't heard any reference to her, through the however many weeks it was, and then suddenly on the last night, her name was mentioned when you were in the video room. So, did you talk about her and were those bits just edited out?</p> <p>Answer: No. We made a decision, she didn't want to have any, um, publicity. She didn't wan anything to do with her, so we made the decision that I was going in and just not referring to her at all. So, hard. And I gave ... I think ... I gave the impression, I tried, it was a really difficult thing for me because I didn't want to come across as if was doing the single game, as in I'm single and I'm on TV so therefore I want to be appealing. I didn't want to do that, and I couldn't talk about Tanya, so I was just like I'll be really evasive when people talk about relationships and whatever. But a lot of people were, actually, and I think there were a few people involved with, you know, or had semi-partners or someone else, I mean everyone was quite evasive.</p> <p>Question: Oh really, like who?</p> <p>Answer: Um ... who, Mel I think.</p> <p>Question: I remember her talking about her ex a bit.</p> <p>Answer: Yeah, kind of her ex, it was never quite clear... Tom it was never quite clear, he kind of had mentioned this girl who he was seeing just before he came in, so I was like, so has he split up with her just before he came or what? You know, that sort of thing.</p> <p>Question: But it seems as though you had an understanding that you wouldn't press anyone else on the subject and no one would press you.</p> <p>Answer: That\u0092s right.</p> <p>Question: So your conversations were completely controlled in that way, you policed yourselves very rigorously, there was an unwritten code, an understanding between you all.</p> <p> Answer: Absolutely. It is weird. It's amazing how the group changed and transformed, and the most amazing thing about the group is that we all were in the same moods. We'd wake up in the morning, and would go, like, I wonder what it's going to be like today, and everyone would start cleaning just out of the blue, someone would go like that and someone would go, oh, oh, oh, and you look around and it's like 6 people cleaning, and then in the evening just everyone would either be depressed at exactly the same time, or everyone would be on such a high, and our moods were so closely linked, that's one of the most bizarre things, and I don't know why. Don't know why. But what was your original question we were talking about? Oh, the unwritten ...</p> <p> Question: Yeah, the understanding of what you would and wouldn't talk about.</p> <p> Answer: Yeah.</p> <p> Question: Because I assumed that for some reason they decided to keep the fact that you had a steady partner ... they'd almost edited out, but no.</p> <p> Answer: She was never mentioned. No. And what we found was that in the first week there was a lot of reference, you don't see this on the TV, to Sada's partner Raph. And that had a really strange effect on the group. She spoke about him all the time. And it was almost like bringing in somebody to the group that wasn't there, that we didn't know, and we were in this little cocoon that we had to kind of ... we were the only people we could relate to, so to speak constantly about your partner was like, um, I don't know, I don't know how to explain it, we would get ... we would get a bit pissed off. Everybody would get a little bit agitated, that she's talking about her bloke again. And maybe it was because we did, some people there did have a love things outside that they had decided not to talk about.</p> <p>Question: It was just introducing an extra dynamic.</p> <p> Answer: Yes.</p> <p> Question: What did you miss the most, apart from Tanya obviously?</p> <p> Answer: Um ... speaking to people who have known me for a long time. I don't initially let myself go. You know they all came in and they're all like chatty chatty la la la, very confident. I remember walking in, me getting out the car and seeing these people and I was so intimidated, I was like, dear Jesus, they've all got personalities! And here's me, silent mute nun walking in!</p> <p> Question: Who were the people that intimidated you most?</p> <p> Answer: Darren, Sada, Nichola, Caroline, those were ... you could see their personality on the outside. Wow, shit! Mel, cos Mel was so ...</p> <p> Question: Good impression!</p> <p> Answer: I love Mel, she's great. All the bad press is rubbish.</p> <p> Question: So you were frightened of not having anyone to relate to really closely ...</p> <p> Answer: Yes, yeah.</p> <p> Question: Anything else?</p> <p> Answer: What else did I hate? Just, yeah, going to the pub, I've said it before. just going to the pub and having a chat with mates. it was so hard ... That was what I missed the most, yeah. It was so hard not being in control. Let me think. Having control, as simply wanting to go out to the shops to buy some [whispers] tampons or whatever. You just couldn't. You just couldn't.</p> <p> Question: That must have got easier as the time went on.</p> <p> Answer: Yes.</p> <p> Question: I mean you all seemed to become sort of reconciled to living in this restricted way.</p> <p> Answer: Oh, completely, absolutely. Absolutely. Every morning, the lights came with this big, it was like kerchoom, you could imagine them switching them on, there was a big noise. And no matter how deep a sleep you were in they were just the perfect level of lighting to wake you up. So every morning ...</p> <p>Question: What, they'd switch on the lights in the bedrooms? I didn't know that.</p> <p>Answer: Did you not ?</p> <p> Question: No. So when you were all sound asleep at 11 o'clock or 12 o'clock, you were sleeping with the light on?</p> <p>Answer: Yeah. Lights on, everything's so, bang bang, bang. At ten, store room open, battery change, half 10, all the time people were forgetting their mikes so someone would say, please put on their microphone, you know, like, fucking hell! And then the strange things like once there was a fire in the kitchen, and the security came in and we were all out the back, security came in, 4 blokes, and we were at the back and we were like [whispers] ooh, shall we talk to them? What do you want me to say? Oh my god, I'm not speaking to them.</p> <p>Question: Cos you knew those were the rule, you mustn't, you couldn't.</p> <p> Answer: Well, yeah, but you could've. We could've tried and said, hallo, but none of us even tried. Yes. None of us even tried, none of us even wanted to.</p> <p> Question: So was that an amazing breakthrough then on the last day when you were waving at the camera man on the crane? And he waved back.</p> <p> Answer: Oh, yeah! That was the first reaction ...</p> <p> Question: And that was like the first time that you'd had any contact with the outside world.</p> <p> Answer: ... oh my god it was the first reaction. What was funny about with those men coming in, we almost didn't want them to speak cos it would've freaked us out. You know. We were so used to, you know, I've said to Big Brother it's almost like routine, what we've had here is a routine, a weekly routine ...</p> <p> Question: Right, and it's kind of comforting as well, in that scary situation.</p> <p> Answer: Yes. Yeah, exactly. And that's why were petrified when Clare came in. We were all ... we couldn't explain it, I was sick with nerves, it's like, this is bizarre, it's a human being coming in to our weird world that we've created, we had our own banter, we had our own, um, ideas of what was happening in the real world and because we'd all expressed them, they'd all kind of merged into one cos we all had this exact same idea of what's going on outside in the real world, cos we had no feedback from anyone else saying, no, that's not right.</p> <p>Question: So what were your theories about the way the programmed was being perceived? you had your own theories about that?</p> <p> Answer: Yeah.</p> <p> Question: What did you think?</p> <p> Answer: Oh, \u0091boring\u0092. [laughs]</p> <p> Question: That's we'd all been switching off in our droves?</p> <p> Answer: Yeah. I kept saying, it's only editing, that's why it\u0092ll be such a snappily edited programme cos we do fuck all</p> <p>Question: But wasn't that comforting as well, the thought that you we in there but no one was watching?</p> <p>Answer: Some of them hoped for loads of people to be watching, and I loved kind of to think the opposite.</p> <p>Answer: Who were the people who really hoped for loads of people to be watching?</p> <p> Answer: Darren. Craig loved the idea of, hey, there's lots of people watching, and loved the idea of people chatting his name and, you know, he's say to me, Anna, they're gonna love you! I'd say I don't want them to love me, just like me. That's fine if they like me, not love me. Mel didn't. Mel was really cool, she's like ... she'd be great because they'd be chatting about what was going to happen afterwards and she's like, we're just going to go back to our lives, and she'd like shatter any little dreams they'd built up. One big giggle in a way, and they'd be like ...</p> <p> Question: Did that cause a bit of friction? Did that sort of ... did you feel that put a wedge between you?</p> <p> Answer: No. We worked off each other, you know, I suppose I did like to see them getting excited about it, so a little bit would sink in. And then they would get a bit, when I say, oh, it's only a game show, we'd all get excited and then someone else would say it, so, you didn't want to let your imagination run away too much ... and we didn't know, that was the thing, we didn't' know what was going on in the outside world.</p> <p> Question: You must have heard the screams on the Friday nights.</p> <p> Answer: Friday night, we had this running joke, someone said, I think it's a tape recorder playing outside. And then, by the time we were on the final week, Darren said, well, I'm on 18 tape recorders out there. And I'm like, I'm on fucking 24 tape recorders out there. Yu can imagine us, just imagine walking out and someone pressing play play play play.</p> <p> Question: And that stuff about the tennis balls and things, you never saw any of those tennis balls?</p> <p> Answer: No. And something else, I was in a little restaurant today, and somebody said it was all a conspiracy, and I said, oh come on, and she said, the whole programme, and I said, what do you mean. She thought people thought that it was set up, we knew each other beforehand, and it was planned, la la la. I said, no, no at all.</p> <p> Question: When Nick was chucked out, everyone thought that he was a plant. There was a very widespread conspiracy theory that took root everywhere, because it was just too good to be true.</p> <p> Answer: The first week, I thought Nick was a plant.</p> <p> Question: Did you?</p> <p> Answer: Yeah cos he kept being called into the diary room. But then we find out that our microphones would break down really easily so we'd all get called into the diary room to get our wires changed through the whole few weeks.</p> <p> Question: So apart from that you harboured no suspicions about Nick?</p> <p> Answer: I was dim. I was just, I didn't, I'm so dim to what's going on, I just didn't see it. At all, at all, at all.</p> <p> Question: But you were lucky because you didn't' get shown the pieces of paper. Were the people who read those pieces of paper without kicking up a stink -- weren't they equally culpable in a way?</p> <p> Answer: Yes. Yeah. And there was a lot of anger, we had a lot of arguments after that.</p> <p> Question: Did you?</p> <p> Answer: Yeah yeah.. That kind of afternoon, turning on people. And after as well. He went so soon. People were saying, why didn\u0092t Mel and Tom shout about it? And Craig: Craig\u0092s brought it up now that he\u0092s been nominated, but why didn\u0092t he bring it up before?</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/review/story/0,6903,373622,00.html\">Continued</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Question: So what have you been doing since getting out? Answer: Since I left I've been staying a lot in my flat, lying low. I've seen lots of people going out here there and everywhere and I thought, no. I just wanted to go home, and be at my home, just chill and relax. Question: Why did you want to do that, rather than go out and celebrate? Answer: I didn't want to go to those big parties you see [the other contestants] all being filmed and photographed and I thought I've had enough of that, you know, almost drove me mad for 10 weeks. Even though C4 offered security because apparently everyone\u0092s homes was being bombarded by the media... you know, ours wasn't! No one was bleeding interested! I was like: no I don't want any security, I don't want anybody at all around. Question: So why are the others behaving so differently? Answer: I think it's just so tempting, they know they're going to mingle with the stars. it's from one extreme to the other, and fair enough when I was in the house I was dreaming of going to the party and having pints and whatever. it's an extension of the personalities as well, the people who are going out, know what I mean, were the ones, even in the house, who wanted attention Question: This all begs the question that we were asking when we were watching it, which is, what on earth were you doing in it, cos it just didn't seem at all .. Answer: Me. Question: There was a lot of positive identification with you, but at the same time, that made us think, why does she want to be on it? Answer: I got carried away with the whole process, as in initially saw the Dutch programme ...and they said, if you're interested, please, you know, call us, and I was intrigued more than anything else so I thought, I'll call them. And then that happened, and then the next stage happened and then the next stage and you're like, oh my god I'm down to the last whatever, oh my god! And then finally it was like, you've been chosen and I was like, oh, I haven't even decided if I really want to do it! I wasn\u0092t on a mission to \"find myself\" or not on a mission to ... I don't know, I just got swept along with the whole thing. Question: And so did you have serious thoughts about whether or not you'd accept? Answer: Yes!I thought about it a lot. My friends were really wary of it. Tanya's sister and, you know, some of my close friends advised me not to do it. They said, they would just go over the top, you know you've been ... you've only been chose cos you're a lesbian ex-nun, and I said, I know, I know I am. I know I am. But still! They said, they're just gonna milk that, you're just interesting just for those two things. Um, and I thought, fair enough, very good point. And also ... and the press would be wicked, in a nasty kind of way. Which actually they weren't. I was just so surprised, we're just really pleased about. And I knew Tanya would go mad if I was away for 9 weeks. Question: What in the end convinced you? Answer: It's so appealing, being on television 24 hours a day, people know it was sick, it was like, attraction to something perverse! [Laughs] And, er, and that's why I did it, I thought ... I actually thought at the end of the day, you know, I dunno, the reasons why people were saying not to do it, like, you're gay, your family ... you know, you're a lesbian and it's going to make bad press, and I thought, well, that's not a reason not to do it. That's, you know, if I really want to do it I should do it, and just be a bit ballsy about it. Shouldn't stop, cos it would stop other people from applying, if there was a lesbian or a gay man who, you know, wasn't totally secure and comfortable about themselves, you know, that would put a lot of people off and I thought, no, I'll just do it. Just do it. But yes, I had doubts. It was just me going through it myself. Shall I do it or should I not do it. All the time. What about my family, what ... what will I get out of it, it's going to probably be a big flop, the s how, anyway, it's probably going to be, oh, cameramen touching theirselves behind the wall! Well all these things go through your head. Question: Was Tanya supportive at the end, when you decided that you going to do it? Answer: She was. Yeah. Absolutely. She was. Question: I was interested in the whole Tanya thing because we hadn't heard any reference to her, through the however many weeks it was, and then suddenly on the last night, her name was mentioned when you were in the video room. So, did you talk about her and were those bits just edited out? Answer: No. We made a decision, she didn't want to have any, um, publicity. She didn't wan anything to do with her, so we made the decision that I was going in and just not referring to her at all. So, hard. And I gave ... I think ... I gave the impression, I tried, it was a really difficult thing for me because I didn't want to come across as if was doing the single game, as in I'm single and I'm on TV so therefore I want to be appealing. I didn't want to do that, and I couldn't talk about Tanya, so I was just like I'll be really evasive when people talk about relationships and whatever. But a lot of people were, actually, and I think there were a few people involved with, you know, or had semi-partners or someone else, I mean everyone was quite evasive. Question: Oh really, like who? Answer: Um ... who, Mel I think. Question: I remember her talking about her ex a bit. Answer: Yeah, kind of her ex, it was never quite clear... Tom it was never quite clear, he kind of had mentioned this girl who he was seeing just before he came in, so I was like, so has he split up with her just before he came or what? You know, that sort of thing. Question: But it seems as though you had an understanding that you wouldn't press anyone else on the subject and no one would press you. Answer: That\u0092s right. Question: So your conversations were completely controlled in that way, you policed yourselves very rigorously, there was an unwritten code, an understanding between you all. Answer: Absolutely. It is weird. It's amazing how the group changed and transformed, and the most amazing thing about the group is that we all were in the same moods. We'd wake up in the morning, and would go, like, I wonder what it's going to be like today, and everyone would start cleaning just out of the blue, someone would go like that and someone would go, oh, oh, oh, and you look around and it's like 6 people cleaning, and then in the evening just everyone would either be depressed at exactly the same time, or everyone would be on such a high, and our moods were so closely linked, that's one of the most bizarre things, and I don't know why. Don't know why. But what was your original question we were talking about? Oh, the unwritten ... Question: Yeah, the understanding of what you would and wouldn't talk about. Answer: Yeah. Question: Because I assumed that for some reason they decided to keep the fact that you had a steady partner ... they'd almost edited out, but no. Answer: She was never mentioned. No. And what we found was that in the first week there was a lot of reference, you don't see this on the TV, to Sada's partner Raph. And that had a really strange effect on the group. She spoke about him all the time. And it was almost like bringing in somebody to the group that wasn't there, that we didn't know, and we were in this little cocoon that we had to kind of ... we were the only people we could relate to, so to speak constantly about your partner was like, um, I don't know, I don't know how to explain it, we would get ... we would get a bit pissed off. Everybody would get a little bit agitated, that she's talking about her bloke again. And maybe it was because we did, some people there did have a love things outside that they had decided not to talk about. Question: It was just introducing an extra dynamic. Answer: Yes. Question: What did you miss the most, apart from Tanya obviously? Answer: Um ... speaking to people who have known me for a long time. I don't initially let myself go. You know they all came in and they're all like chatty chatty la la la, very confident. I remember walking in, me getting out the car and seeing these people and I was so intimidated, I was like, dear Jesus, they've all got personalities! And here's me, silent mute nun walking in! Question: Who were the people that intimidated you most? Answer: Darren, Sada, Nichola, Caroline, those were ... you could see their personality on the outside. Wow, shit! Mel, cos Mel was so ... Question: Good impression! Answer: I love Mel, she's great. All the bad press is rubbish. Question: So you were frightened of not having anyone to relate to really closely ... Answer: Yes, yeah. Question: Anything else? Answer: What else did I hate? Just, yeah, going to the pub, I've said it before. just going to the pub and having a chat with mates. it was so hard ... That was what I missed the most, yeah. It was so hard not being in control. Let me think. Having control, as simply wanting to go out to the shops to buy some [whispers] tampons or whatever. You just couldn't. You just couldn't. Question: That must have got easier as the time went on. Answer: Yes. Question: I mean you all seemed to become sort of reconciled to living in this restricted way. Answer: Oh, completely, absolutely. Absolutely. Every morning, the lights came with this big, it was like kerchoom, you could imagine them switching them on, there was a big noise. And no matter how deep a sleep you were in they were just the perfect level of lighting to wake you up. So every morning ... Question: What, they'd switch on the lights in the bedrooms? I didn't know that. Answer: Did you not ? Question: No. So when you were all sound asleep at 11 o'clock or 12 o'clock, you were sleeping with the light on? Answer: Yeah. Lights on, everything's so, bang bang, bang. At ten, store room open, battery change, half 10, all the time people were forgetting their mikes so someone would say, please put on their microphone, you know, like, fucking hell! And then the strange things like once there was a fire in the kitchen, and the security came in and we were all out the back, security came in, 4 blokes, and we were at the back and we were like [whispers] ooh, shall we talk to them? What do you want me to say? Oh my god, I'm not speaking to them. Question: Cos you knew those were the rule, you mustn't, you couldn't. Answer: Well, yeah, but you could've. We could've tried and said, hallo, but none of us even tried. Yes. None of us even tried, none of us even wanted to. Question: So was that an amazing breakthrough then on the last day when you were waving at the camera man on the crane? And he waved back. Answer: Oh, yeah! That was the first reaction ... Question: And that was like the first time that you'd had any contact with the outside world. Answer: ... oh my god it was the first reaction. What was funny about with those men coming in, we almost didn't want them to speak cos it would've freaked us out. You know. We were so used to, you know, I've said to Big Brother it's almost like routine, what we've had here is a routine, a weekly routine ... Question: Right, and it's kind of comforting as well, in that scary situation. Answer: Yes. Yeah, exactly. And that's why were petrified when Clare came in. We were all ... we couldn't explain it, I was sick with nerves, it's like, this is bizarre, it's a human being coming in to our weird world that we've created, we had our own banter, we had our own, um, ideas of what was happening in the real world and because we'd all expressed them, they'd all kind of merged into one cos we all had this exact same idea of what's going on outside in the real world, cos we had no feedback from anyone else saying, no, that's not right. Question: So what were your theories about the way the programmed was being perceived? you had your own theories about that? Answer: Yeah. Question: What did you think? Answer: Oh, \u0091boring\u0092. [laughs] Question: That's we'd all been switching off in our droves? Answer: Yeah. I kept saying, it's only editing, that's why it\u0092ll be such a snappily edited programme cos we do fuck all Question: But wasn't that comforting as well, the thought that you we in there but no one was watching? Answer: Some of them hoped for loads of people to be watching, and I loved kind of to think the opposite. Answer: Who were the people who really hoped for loads of people to be watching? Answer: Darren. Craig loved the idea of, hey, there's lots of people watching, and loved the idea of people chatting his name and, you know, he's say to me, Anna, they're gonna love you! I'd say I don't want them to love me, just like me. That's fine if they like me, not love me. Mel didn't. Mel was really cool, she's like ... she'd be great because they'd be chatting about what was going to happen afterwards and she's like, we're just going to go back to our lives, and she'd like shatter any little dreams they'd built up. One big giggle in a way, and they'd be like ... Question: Did that cause a bit of friction? Did that sort of ... did you feel that put a wedge between you? Answer: No. We worked off each other, you know, I suppose I did like to see them getting excited about it, so a little bit would sink in. And then they would get a bit, when I say, oh, it's only a game show, we'd all get excited and then someone else would say it, so, you didn't want to let your imagination run away too much ... and we didn't know, that was the thing, we didn't' know what was going on in the outside world. Question: You must have heard the screams on the Friday nights. Answer: Friday night, we had this running joke, someone said, I think it's a tape recorder playing outside. And then, by the time we were on the final week, Darren said, well, I'm on 18 tape recorders out there. And I'm like, I'm on fucking 24 tape recorders out there. Yu can imagine us, just imagine walking out and someone pressing play play play play. Question: And that stuff about the tennis balls and things, you never saw any of those tennis balls? Answer: No. And something else, I was in a little restaurant today, and somebody said it was all a conspiracy, and I said, oh come on, and she said, the whole programme, and I said, what do you mean. She thought people thought that it was set up, we knew each other beforehand, and it was planned, la la la. I said, no, no at all. Question: When Nick was chucked out, everyone thought that he was a plant. There was a very widespread conspiracy theory that took root everywhere, because it was just too good to be true. Answer: The first week, I thought Nick was a plant. Question: Did you? Answer: Yeah cos he kept being called into the diary room. But then we find out that our microphones would break down really easily so we'd all get called into the diary room to get our wires changed through the whole few weeks. Question: So apart from that you harboured no suspicions about Nick? Answer: I was dim. I was just, I didn't, I'm so dim to what's going on, I just didn't see it. At all, at all, at all. Question: But you were lucky because you didn't' get shown the pieces of paper. Were the people who read those pieces of paper without kicking up a stink -- weren't they equally culpable in a way? Answer: Yes. Yeah. And there was a lot of anger, we had a lot of arguments after that. Question: Did you? Answer: Yeah yeah.. That kind of afternoon, turning on people. And after as well. He went so soon. People were saying, why didn\u0092t Mel and Tom shout about it? And Craig: Craig\u0092s brought it up now that he\u0092s been nominated, but why didn\u0092t he bring it up before?

      "body": "<p>Question: When you think back, what is your defining moment, what is you clearest memory, that just says Big Brother House to you.</p> <p> Answer: Waiting. Waiting, waiting for a shopping list, waiting for nominations, I was tense, I would say, 6 out of the 9 weeks .On and off, I'd say 70% I found it a strain, waiting for nomina... having to nom... who's going to be evicted and ... the difference of say the first two weeks when we had to make an effort to chat to everybody and all this noise[?] going on, being exhausted because you're like, I have to make polite conversation with somebody, compared to, um, this last 3 days of sheer and utter, oh that I'd never ever experienced anything, the last few days, ever.</p> <p> Question: You didn\u0092t look as if you were having the easiest time communicating with Craig. You all became a bit polarised, and you did look sort of like someone had hit you over the head with a frying pan. You all did, you all had a kind of glazed look at the end.</p> <p> Answer: Yes, exactly. It was because, I just didn't want to talk to anyone and so I was ... cos I was tense. I was so bored, I'd finished my books, I had nothing, there wasn't even a shopping list to bloody write, we didn't have to look after the garden cos we were going in 3 days, there was nothing nothing nothing. People say well why didn't you ... it's like ... cos there was nothing. And there was bad weather. And also we didn't want to talk to each other because why, why should we talk to each other, all we would talk about was that.</p> <p>Question: There was nothing left to say? </p> <p> Answer: Well, in 3 days time one of us is going to win 70,000 pounds. No one ever really, no one talked about that. About winning.</p> <p> Question: Why not? Would it be bad manners?</p> <p> Answer: Because then you'd have a competitive conversation, and what's the point in that, and there would be, well how do you have a conversation about, I'm about to win, maybe one of us is gonna win 70,000 pounds, like, what would you converse about, well, I think I should get ... I think you should get ... we're not going to say that, because you're aware the cameras are there. </p> <p> Question: Did you know that Craig was going to give the money away?</p> <p> Answer: No, not until, er, the day before.</p> <p> Question: What was the conversation like?</p> <p> Answer: The conversation was like: I'm telling you tomorrow night, 9 o'clock what I'm doing with the money. And I knew he was going to do it.</p> <p> Question: What, you knew he was going to give the money away?</p> <p> Answer: Yeah. I'd reckoned.</p> <p> Question: Where had you got that from?</p> <p> Answer: Because he always went on and said how, he couldn't talk about what he was doing with his money. From day one. He'd say hey, I'm not going to talk about what I'm doing with the money. And I wanted to say, well, don't talk about not talking. It was wonderful, I have to say, you know, he was the right winner. I was just saying this to the psychologist, the shrink who we saw throughout the programme: Craig was the right one, wasn't he, he was the right winner, he was perfect. He wanted it the most, it's what the public wanted the mostl, and he came out and he gave that money to Jo, and I was in tears when I saw it, I have to say, oh my god. Yeah. He's a star, he is, you know, he's a good ...</p> <p> Question: It was a very graceful and surprising telly moment.</p> <p> Answer: Ah, but it was perfect for the production... it was like the best finale anyone could have wanted, and it was this really decent thing to do, and the programme just like peaked at the right time.</p> <p> Question: In a way what's sad about is that it's robbed you and Darren of the glory of coming second.</p> <p> Answer: I don't want it.</p> <p>Question: What were you going to have done with the money? Did you have plans?</p> <p> Answer: Yeah.</p> <p> Question: What were you going to do?</p> <p> Answer: Boring stuff.</p> <p> Question: Like?</p> <p> Answer: Deposit for a flat, some money to give to people, and a few treats, and that's it.</p> <p> Question: Treats like?</p> <p> Answer: I don't know.</p> <p> Question: Was it one of those things you steered yourself away from thinking about, because otherwise it would have made it all too serious?</p> <p> Answer: Yeah. What you did do was, I'm sure the other two will agree, you prepared yourself for winning so you kind of went over what's going to happen, you're going to prepare yourself going through the actions but then you didn't prepare to spend the money.</p> <p> Question: You sort of prepared your arguments for Davina because you know were going to be asked that if you came out.</p> <p> Answer: Yeah. I'd prepared, it was like when mostly before the evictions, sitting down waiting for the names, I would just say, Anna, Anna, Anna, Anna, so when you hear it you're not shocked, your mind at least is prepared for it. And, when Craig won, I was thinking: Craig, the winner is Craig, Craig, Craig. </p> <p> Question: So you retained a tiny bit of control over it.</p> <p> Answer: Yeah. Absolutely. And then we all went on, everyday we'd all talk about how ... cos we, during the last week, none of us slept really, none of us really slept, it was fucking horrible. because, all of us would think about, opening the door, walking down the walkway, seeing what's happening, people are going to ask you, blah blah blah, so when ... I know when Darren left he was rally calm, I know when I left I was just calm it's like, I've gone through this 100 times in my head, this is what's kept me sane for the past 9 weeks, you know, opening this door, going down the walkway.</p> <p> Question: So what surprised you about the way it's been received?</p> <p> Answer: I was surprised at the interest because I didn't feel that what we were doing was worthy of any viewing.</p> <p> Question: But you wanted to go on it as an experiment, you were saying, so you were giving it some credibility in your own mind anyway. </p> <p>Answer: Yes. But because we're 24 hours of it, we lost interest after two weeks. Of course you only what you're doing, and you don't know that there's 9 other people relating, you know, and talking and doing strange things... talking and showing names.</p> <p> Question: What was the worst moment?</p> <p> Answer: Oh, crying in front of everyone, yeah. Well I wanted to leave because it wasn't enough, it wasn't worth it, I wasn't getting enough from it to stay. Enjoyment. And there wasn't that. Because basically everyone just slowed, your metabolism just slows down, you're not walking more than 10 paces ever, so you just go weerrr, everyone just goes, weeerrr, and I stayed because, I dunno, there was, I'd pick up that people really wanted to win, that's the thing. . The men were so different, such a different approach. That was really funny.</p> <p> Question: That got your goat?</p> <p> Answer: That's what, I was like, I thought, oh for that time I was thinking of leaving I was like, did they think I was such a sap? They didn't, they were absolutely ... actually they all came up to me and they were quite sympathetic and were, yeah, we think like that as well but we don't say it, you know. But then, they were so focused I thought, oh, just fuck it, be focused, like them, it's not the end of the world.</p> <p> Question: And so you bucked up.</p> <p> Answer: Yeah yeah. And you did after the first 2 to 3 weeks you're always adjusting how you approach life in the Big Brother House, all the time going, forget about this, stop, you know, forget about walking, this is what you're going to do, and you do, and your mind just goes, OK. And you train, everyone trained their brains, you know, trained their minds how to approach the situations.</p> <p> Question: Was that how you coped with everyone else in the house and fitted in? </p> <p>Answer: It was survival. A survival technique. Adapting. Yeah, adapting.</p> <p> Question: Was the point for you to get on with everyone?</p> <p> Answer: Yes. Yeah. And I think, why I'm pleased I was there to the last week was that, it means, you know, I was a success in the house, we didn't know about the public, Craig was a success in the public, and that's fine, that's absolutely fine with me.</p> <p> Question: Why do you think you won in the house?</p> <p> Answer: I don't know...</p> <p> Question: You do know, you just won't tell me. </p> <p>Answer: To be honest, I can let a lot go over my head, let a huge amount go over my head. I'm not that bothered by a lot of the things anyway. And, I do have, you know, I dunno, got an alright nature, so.</p> <p> Question: What was your best moment?</p> <p> Answer: Best moment, I used to have such a scream with Caroline and Nichola, you don't see it, you have no idea, those two ...</p> <p> Question: Stuff they wouldn't show?Like what?</p> <p> Answer: I don't know if I should say this, but I'll say it.</p> <p> Question: You've got to!</p> <p> Answer: They were so much more over the top, you have no idea. People got intimated by that and I loved that. I loved the fact that people got a little bit, oh, Caroline[?] what do we do meetings.</p> <p> Question: The blokes?</p> <p> Answer: Yeah. Caroline and Nicola were out there being outrageous, and I just laughed and laughed, and just trotted along behind them. \u0093What do we do now, girls?\u0094 Oh god, when they went it was just like hell.</p> <p> Question: So you've watched the tapes?</p> <p> Answer: Some, I've only watched up to like week 5. This is what friends have recorded.</p> <p> Question: Channel 4 haven't given you the tapes?</p> <p> Answer: They are going to give them to us, yes.</p> <p> Question: They're taking their time. That's nice.</p> <p> Answer: Are they? Shall I should demand them?</p> <p> Question: Definitely, it\u0092s vital for your debriefing... </p> <p> Answer: I thought we were getting a little press pack. Well I didn't want to watch them anyway when I came out. Too boring. And then there\u0092s my hair. My hair, it was just like, Tanya's like, for fuck's sake, it's the worst bit, the hassle I've had about your fucking hair.It's just like there was two chickens at the back of my head, there was just this mat of hair.</p> <p> Question: Did you take a hairbrush in?</p> <p> Answer: I did, and I found it on the last day.</p> <p> Question: I wanted to ask about your books, you took in Wild Swans ...</p> <p> Answer: No no no.</p> <p> Question: Whose was Wild Swans?</p> <p> Answer: That was Mel's. I took in Cat's Eye, and to Kill A Mockingbird.</p> <p> Question: Two books, for ten weeks?</p> <p> Answer: yes but what you do is, I worked out the first week I would read everyone else's book, because basically they are supposed to take the books away with them when they leave so you're like, well at least I'll read something, __________ [inaudible] have other people's books.</p> <p> Question: Even if it is a Rosamund Pilcher or Richard Branson's autobiography, which had such an impact on Craig.. did you read that?</p> <p> Answer: I read 4 pages, and then I wanted to use it for ... ! (mouths \u0091toilet paper\u0092)</p> <p> Question: So you watched the tapes, and do you recognise what you've seen?</p> <p> Answer: Mm.</p> <p> Question: You don't feel unfairly edited or you don't feel that the programme was steered in a certain direction by the editing?</p> <p> Answer: It was, I'd say it was like an intense representation of everyone else and initially when you look at it you're shocked and I thought, well it is kind of what they're like but it's all pff gone into an episode. I feel Mel was unfairly represented. </p> <p>Question: They did definitely create a narrative about Mel I think. </p> <p>Answer: It's just like, oh, jealous minxes.</p> <p> Question: Do you think?</p> <p> Answer: Oh yeah. The blokes loved Mel. They were so smitten. They were so smitten with Mel, you know what I mean, and she's very much, she's cool, she's cool. She was fairly tactile... I suppose that is being flirty. Um, she very much needed a best friend for the time that she was there.</p> <p> Question: And her best friends mostly tended to be men. </p> <p> Answer: Yeah, but early on Mel did pick up that there was a lot of animosity towards her from the girls camp. Stupidly created by some girls. You know.</p> <p> Question: OK. Which girls?</p> <p> Answer: Not telling.</p> <p> Question: Apart from the Mel thing has anyone else sort of taken you surprise about the way it looked on telly? apart from your hair obviously.</p> <p> Answer: Apart from my hair and my shorts. Um, no. No.</p> <p> Question: When you did something like farting or spilling beer down your front and you just thought, \u0091well, hopefully they won't broadcast that\u0092 and then they did -- was there anything like that?</p> <p> Answer: Yeah, I opened the fridge and I farted.</p> <p> Question: When you did that, did you hope they wouldn\u0092t show it?</p> <p> Answer: No, you don't give a shite, I didn't give a shite what they put out after a while. It's just like, it's me, and of anyone, you know, if you're gonna try and hide anything, you shouldn't be on this show. You see I laugh, I'd laugh at things, I'd see the tape and laugh at my hair or I'd laugh, I look like a frump, it's so funny, I just, like, fucking hell I didn't choose my best side that bleeding morning. And it's fine. It's all fine. I'm not bothered by anything that's been put out there.</p> <p> Question: Your brother in law has written about how you suppressed your intellectual superiority while you were on the programme.</p> <p> Answer: Did he?

      "bodyText": "Question: When you think back, what is your defining moment, what is you clearest memory, that just says Big Brother House to you. Answer: Waiting. Waiting, waiting for a shopping list, waiting for nominations, I was tense, I would say, 6 out of the 9 weeks .On and off, I'd say 70% I found it a strain, waiting for nomina... having to nom... who's going to be evicted and ... the difference of say the first two weeks when we had to make an effort to chat to everybody and all this noise[?] going on, being exhausted because you're like, I have to make polite conversation with somebody, compared to, um, this last 3 days of sheer and utter, oh that I'd never ever experienced anything, the last few days, ever. Question: You didn\u0092t look as if you were having the easiest time communicating with Craig. You all became a bit polarised, and you did look sort of like someone had hit you over the head with a frying pan. You all did, you all had a kind of glazed look at the end. Answer: Yes, exactly. It was because, I just didn't want to talk to anyone and so I was ... cos I was tense. I was so bored, I'd finished my books, I had nothing, there wasn't even a shopping list to bloody write, we didn't have to look after the garden cos we were going in 3 days, there was nothing nothing nothing. People say well why didn't you ... it's like ... cos there was nothing. And there was bad weather. And also we didn't want to talk to each other because why, why should we talk to each other, all we would talk about was that. Question: There was nothing left to say? Answer: Well, in 3 days time one of us is going to win 70,000 pounds. No one ever really, no one talked about that. About winning. Question: Why not? Would it be bad manners? Answer: Because then you'd have a competitive conversation, and what's the point in that, and there would be, well how do you have a conversation about, I'm about to win, maybe one of us is gonna win 70,000 pounds, like, what would you converse about, well, I think I should get ... I think you should get ... we're not going to say that, because you're aware the cameras are there. Question: Did you know that Craig was going to give the money away? Answer: No, not until, er, the day before. Question: What was the conversation like? Answer: The conversation was like: I'm telling you tomorrow night, 9 o'clock what I'm doing with the money. And I knew he was going to do it. Question: What, you knew he was going to give the money away? Answer: Yeah. I'd reckoned. Question: Where had you got that from? Answer: Because he always went on and said how, he couldn't talk about what he was doing with his money. From day one. He'd say hey, I'm not going to talk about what I'm doing with the money. And I wanted to say, well, don't talk about not talking. It was wonderful, I have to say, you know, he was the right winner. I was just saying this to the psychologist, the shrink who we saw throughout the programme: Craig was the right one, wasn't he, he was the right winner, he was perfect. He wanted it the most, it's what the public wanted the mostl, and he came out and he gave that money to Jo, and I was in tears when I saw it, I have to say, oh my god. Yeah. He's a star, he is, you know, he's a good ... Question: It was a very graceful and surprising telly moment. Answer: Ah, but it was perfect for the production... it was like the best finale anyone could have wanted, and it was this really decent thing to do, and the programme just like peaked at the right time. Question: In a way what's sad about is that it's robbed you and Darren of the glory of coming second. Answer: I don't want it. Question: What were you going to have done with the money? Did you have plans? Answer: Yeah. Question: What were you going to do? Answer: Boring stuff. Question: Like? Answer: Deposit for a flat, some money to give to people, and a few treats, and that's it. Question: Treats like? Answer: I don't know. Question: Was it one of those things you steered yourself away from thinking about, because otherwise it would have made it all too serious? Answer: Yeah. What you did do was, I'm sure the other two will agree, you prepared yourself for winning so you kind of went over what's going to happen, you're going to prepare yourself going through the actions but then you didn't prepare to spend the money. Question: You sort of prepared your arguments for Davina because you know were going to be asked that if you came out. Answer: Yeah. I'd prepared, it was like when mostly before the evictions, sitting down waiting for the names, I would just say, Anna, Anna, Anna, Anna, so when you hear it you're not shocked, your mind at least is prepared for it. And, when Craig won, I was thinking: Craig, the winner is Craig, Craig, Craig. Question: So you retained a tiny bit of control over it. Answer: Yeah. Absolutely. And then we all went on, everyday we'd all talk about how ... cos we, during the last week, none of us slept really, none of us really slept, it was fucking horrible. because, all of us would think about, opening the door, walking down the walkway, seeing what's happening, people are going to ask you, blah blah blah, so when ... I know when Darren left he was rally calm, I know when I left I was just calm it's like, I've gone through this 100 times in my head, this is what's kept me sane for the past 9 weeks, you know, opening this door, going down the walkway. Question: So what surprised you about the way it's been received? Answer: I was surprised at the interest because I didn't feel that what we were doing was worthy of any viewing.

Everyone knows that we became the most fickle group of people ever, seeing them all there again was like, Jesus.</p> <p> Question: You'd sort of got your head round the idea that you wouldn't see them again and that was it.</p> <p> Answer: Oh yeah. </p> <p> Question: So is there any of them that you're going to stay in touch with?</p> <p> Answer: Mel. And I'd like to give Darren a bell </p> <p> Question: Have you seen either of them since you got out?</p> <p> Answer: Yes. I saw Mel today and we went for lunch a couple of days ago.</p> <p> Question: So you're getting a bit of sort of attention on the streets and stuff, but it's all benevolent is it?</p> <p> Answer: Lovely. Men going, \u0093Alright my darling? You alright?\u0094</p> <p> Question: They all voted for Craig, people like that.</p> <p> Answer: Really? Alright I'll give them the fingers the next time they say it.</p> <p> Question: Was there an element of disappointment that you didn\u0092t win?</p> <p> Answer: No.</p> <p> Question: You sure? Because that must have been ...</p> <p> Answer: I wanted to win the day before, I really thought, fuck, I really want to win, I really do, it would be lovely. And then, I didn't, and then ... I knew Craig would win, even from the first week Craig would win. Disappointment? Yeah a bit, but then you're like, what have you won, what's this programme all about, well, has the most interesting person won? has the most intelligent person won? Has the most combination of all? You know. Do I want the mass of the UK and Irish public to like me? I only want the people who I think I would like, to like me. I don't want mass popularity.</p> <p> Question: What are you planning to do now? What's your game plan? </p> <p> Answer: What's my game plan? \"lot of things in the pipeline,\" which means not going to say anything or I'll be turned down. I'm going over to do the Late Late Show tomorrow night in Ireland. You have to do that. Possibly the Priory next week. And then, all these offers have come in, newspapers, and I said I don't want any newspapers, just one, that's fine, um ...</p> <p> Question: Did you particularly want the Observer? That\u0092s what we were told. </p> <p> Answer: Yeah.</p> <p> Question: You don't have to say that...</p> <p> Answer: I said, I said the Observer, Guardian, Telegraph. And I was just like, no tabloids, and then, the Observer was mentioned, I said yes that's great. </p> <p> Question: Right. So are you going to do TV presenting?</p> <p> Answer: Yeah, well not TV presenting, there's maybe a couple of documentaries that have come in, that they're interested in me doing, which is nice. Yeah, me infront of a camera. Not being all ... I'm not a personality that would go down well on TV I think. Just ... stuff that I'm interested in.</p> <p> Question: Right. Are they comedy things or a series or ...</p> <p> Answer: Um ... I don't know if I should say.</p> <p> Question: Give me a vague hint</p> <p> Answer: Kind of I suppose factual look at certain different cultures and life, that sort of thing, and commentary on ... and going away to places and ... etc.</p> <p>Question: So what about the music stuff, is that something that you've going to pursue?</p> <p> Answer: I wanted to but there's very little scope, seemingly, for following up the music.</p> <p> Question: Was this a surprise? Disappointment?</p> <p> Answer: A wee bit, yeah, a wee bit. Television wise there's very little music coverage on television. It's bizarre, but, and there's a chance of a slot on a radio station, having a little show, where I talk rubbish everyday! That would be great!</p> <p> Question: Is that in London or ...</p> <p> Answer: Yeah yeah. Not a mainstream station. I don't want a recording thing.No. I'm not that good, really I'm not.</p> <p> Question: I wouldn't have thought that would have bothered a lot of producers though</p> <p> Answer: Yeah, some of the others have been offered recording contracts.</p> <p> Question: I can't wait to hear Nichola's.</p> <p> Answer: Have you not heard it?</p> <p> Question: No. Have you?</p> <p> Answer: Yeah.</p> <p> Question: What do you think?</p> <p> Answer: It's OK. IT is, it's very \"well produced\" [giggles]</p> <p> Question: Did you know that Big Brother was going to be a sort of springboard to other things</p> <p> Answer: No.</p> <p> Question: You must have had a sense you had of an opportunity to kind of audition yourself for a complete change of career.</p> <p> Answer: Yeah. What we all decided, see, I had an idea, we were talking about, um, what is the link, what is the connection that we all have, and it came out that everyone wanted to change their life somehow, and, they wanted to go back to their life but just wanted time to have time away from it, or, really think about how their life has gone so far because if you're basically really content and happy, hour job, your life, your family, you're not gonna do this show, what's the point. so it was all like 11 people who just wanted to give themselves a right old kick up the ass, a real shock, and then, come out the other end, see what would happen. That was it, you'd come out and just see what would happen. A failure or a big success, you might have had time away to decide what you really want to do with your life, and, it was inspiring, chatting to some of the people there about what they'd done on their travels. I know Tom was really taken, Tom was really inspired to change his life himself, regardless of what was happening afterwards. And you learnt a lot, and I know Darren learnt a whole lot. You would hear so many funny stories from Nichola and Caroline about what they got up to, whether they're clubbing up or whatever, I mean they were outrageous. And he couldn\u0092t believe his ears. He's so intriguing because he's one of the most mature people I've ever, ever met, and he is also such a little kid. Doesn't know anything. So unworldly, you know, yet so daddy.</p> <p> Question: So it was a complete eye-opener for him?</p> <p> Answer: Mm.</p> <p> Question: Your mother apparently never watched Big Brother, is this true?</p> <p> Answer: That's true.</p> <p> Question: Did you know she wasn't going to watch it?</p> <p> Answer: I thought she mightn't, yeah. She got hassled a lot from the press, a lot of the time. Had a hard time wiht it, cos of course she'd see newspapers and she'd sort of ... pffff When she met with Mary[?] she said a very funny comment, some sort of reference to me saying, \u0091Eileen and Kevin Nolan, devout Catholic parents of Anna Nolan, the lesbian ex-nun who said she'd bring a vibrator in with her.\u0092 And her reaction was: \u0091I was disgusted! Devout Irish Catholic, how dare they?\u0092</p> <p>Question: She's displayed no curiosity about it at all?</p> <p> Answer: No. She wasn't watching it... if she had I think she would have had back-up from people coming up to her and talking to her and chatting to her, but she always just said no, I'm not interested. She had to answer all the time to journalists, all the time. She says no, it's Anna's show, and ... and she's so happy, she's so delighted with it all, you know.</p> <p>Question: Were you surprised?</p> <p> Answer: No.That's just her.</p> <p> Question: How do you feel that apparently there's going to be a Big Brother module in some psychology courses in universities? Will you be signing up? </p> <p>Answer: No!</p> <p> Question: Do you think there are lessons that we can learn from it, do you think it does say anything important about the human condition?</p> <p> Answer: I think it says more about the people who watched it rather than the people who were in the house, definitely. Why did people get so interested? Why? Why was it so big, how was it so big? You tell me.</p> <p> Question: What's your theory?</p> <p> Answer: Um, if I could vote somebody out of Eastenders every week I would. Or whatever.</p> <p> Question: You think it was kind of vengeful almost.</p> <p> Answer: It\u0092s like having control over a soap opera for the first time. </p> <p> Question: But I think also there was a kind of fondness that kicked in, and that analogy with guinea pigs was just really accurate as well because you were all like little pets.</p> <p> Answer: Yeah.</p> <p> Question: You know, we could change your litter occasionally...</p> <p> Answer: Yeah. I don't know you see, I don't know, I'm overwhelmed by people\u0092s reactions. </p> <p> Question: Do you feel a little bit sad for the people who voted as well?</p> <p> Answer: No.</p> <p> Question: Would you have voted?</p> <p> Answer: Yeah. Yeah absolutely. Absolutely I would have. I would have been gripped. It's interesting that weren't that interesting but we were. </p> <p> Question: You were conscious from the moment you woke up that you were being filmed? never forgot about that?</p> <p> Answer: You never forget, you just don't ... you don't care after a while. You hear [Sings] Billy the cameraman or whatever tripping over in the run.</p> <p> Question: There was that element of the Stockholm Syndrome that one of the psychologists mentioned about, people that are held captive quite often fall in love with their captors...</p> <p> Answer: We became so ... we'd hear a voice and think,\u0092that voice is so attractive.... the woman's voice that comes on on a Thursday afternoon, like, yeah, I'm gonna ask her out.\u0092 We loved Big Brother, and then we'd fucking hate them. They brought so much emotion, you know, so much emotion that you had, I dunno, it's like, a fixation with them, yeah.</p> <p> Question: Ttalking about the way you all basically obeyed and were quite compliant... I was watching that documentary about all the different other big brothers and how the Spaniards sort of rose in revolt after day 3 and all agreed they'd give the money to the same person in the end. Did you see the programme?</p> <p> Answer: Yes.We couldn't have done that, because we weren't allowed to talk about nominations beforehand, so it wouldn't have worked.</p> <p> Question: I suppose I mean, do you think there was a sort of national stereotype -- no one was confrontational.</p> <p> Answer: Mel was very confrontational. Very very. Complained all the time to Big Brother. We'd have arguments and she came out she made us feel really stupid one day after BB had told us to clean out the chickens, she said, what do you mean we have to clean the chickens out? the chickens are ill, we're not clearing the chicken. She flipped. She flipped quite a few times about the way we were so brainwashed. </p> <p>Question: Mel was the oneperson who agitated, otherwise you were all quite obedient.</p> <p> Answer: No, the time when we had our favourite songs. They told us, you're going to hear your songs at 8 o'clock, and then you're all going to sit down and talk about why they\u0092re important to you. We all flipped. We went in and we complained and said, we're not doing it, we were told it's a treat, a reward,but they said, you\u0092ve got to do it. </p> <p> Question: But you did it? IN the end you did have little chats about it.</p> <p> Answer: Yes.Yeah, it was horrible, I felt sick.</p> <p> Question: They had gone too far?</p> <p> Answer: They were threatening us. If you did well you got your treats. We were so wrapped around them, you know. When Nick left and we were all gutted and then we got a video, a bar of chocolate, we were like, hey, Nick who?</p> <p> Question: Oh just one last question, I like this quote of Nick saying she's dangerous because she's calculating, she's like a cobra.</p> <p> Answer: I love that as well. Deadly as a snake. Did you hear on the TV programme as well? \u0091Deadly as a snake.\u0092 Whispering. </p> <p>Question: Is that pantomime or is that real for him?</p> <p> Answer: That's real for him. He's very ... he's a strange man.</p> <p> Question: So there's no sort of real curiosity, you don't have any curiosity about seeing him again.</p> <p> Answer: No. I think he fooled us all and he fooled the nation so much more because they all absolutely are intrigued and adore him and I'm just like, Nick, you just need help.</p> <p>Question: That's what it boils down to?</p> <p> Answer: Yeah.</p> <p> Question: OK. Brill.</p> <p> Answer: Brillo pads!</p> <p> Question: Thank you so much.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Officers aboard the aircraft carrier Invincible failed to alert other British warships about the first Exocet missile attack during the Falklands conflict although they had 19 minutes warning, it was revealed yesterday.</p> <p>One missile - fired from an Argentine plane first spotted on radar 180 miles away - hit the destroyer HMS Sheffield, killing 20 men and wounding 24. The Ministry of Defence confirmed yesterday that a series of sightings on HMS Invincible were dismissed by senior officers as \"spurious\" and that no warning was passed to other ships in the Falklands task force.</p> <p>HMS Sheffield, only on half-alert and with its own radar not fully operational, got little more than a minute's warning. The attack caused the first mass British casualties of the south Atlantic war in 1982.</p> <p>Yesterday a former radar operator on the carrier, David Forster, 37, said the officer who decided not to warn the fleet should \"admit and explain\" his decision: \"I want him to apologise.\"</p> <p>He said the officer, in the Invincible electronic operations room, dismissed sightings by him and other operators by accusing them of \"chasing rabbits\". Mr Forster added that he personally felt he had \"let 20 men die\" by failing to insist that other ships were alerted. \"This has been on my mind for the last 18 years.</p> <p>\"I should have stood up and shouted, 'There's something coming in, believe me - alert the fleet.' I'll always punish myself in my conscience for the death of those men. The Sheffield was a sitting duck. It never had a chance to change course, fire its chaff [anti-radar foil] or even its missiles. Remorse and sadness lie heavy on my heart.\"</p> <p>The MoD ruled out an inquiry into the conduct of the officer responsible, whose identity has not yet been officially confirmed. \"No doubt the officer will still be thinking 'if only',\" a spokesman said.</p> <p><b> Remorse</b><br></p> <p>\"I don't think that blame is the word, given the set of circumstances. But that does not relieve him of a sense of personal and professional regret.\"</p> <p>Last night Des Keoghane, organiser of the Falklands Families Association, said, \"I have spoken to a parent of one of the Sheffield dead. He has not heard of this before - and neither have I.\"</p> <p>Invincible's then captain, Admiral Sir Jeremy Black, who rose to be home fleet commander-in-chief and an aide de camp to the Queen before retiring from the navy in 1992, declined to comment.</p> <p>The MoD confirmed the incident, on May 4, 1982, after a Guardian investigation into separate accounts from two ex-able seaman radar operators on the Invincible. The operators, now civilians, have not previously disclosed what happened</p> <p>Inquiries established that the incident was confirmed soon afterwards in the Falklands Deployment Book, a souvenir volume of recollections of Invincible's role in the south Atlantic written by officers. Circulated only to crew members in January 1983, six months after the liberation of the Falklands, it says the radar sightings were classified as \"spurious\".</p> <p>A Royal Navy Sea Harrier fighter was asked to check with its airborne radar \"but could find nothing\", the deployment book says. The Exocet hit the Sheffield 19 minutes after the first sighting by Invincible, according to its timetable of sightings.</p> <p>This crucial series of radar traces was not known to the eminent historian David Brown, formerly of the Royal Navy historical branch, when he wrote what the navy regards as the nearest thing to an official history of the conflict at sea.</p> <p>Mr Brown's book, The Royal Navy and the Falklands War, says that before the attack \"there were no bogeys [unidentified aircraft assumed to be hostile] on any of the radar screens\".</p> <p>Mr Brown notes that in previous days a series of radar false alarms had led to British warships being put on full action stations. His history says the Sheffield was first warned by another destroyer when the two Argentine Super Etendard attack planes - with top flying speeds of 733mph - were only 25 miles away. Her own radar was jammed because officers were making a satellite phone call to fleet headquarters in Northwood, London.

      "bodyText": "Officers aboard the aircraft carrier Invincible failed to alert other British warships about the first Exocet missile attack during the Falklands conflict although they had 19 minutes warning, it was revealed yesterday. One missile - fired from an Argentine plane first spotted on radar 180 miles away - hit the destroyer HMS Sheffield, killing 20 men and wounding 24. The Ministry of Defence confirmed yesterday that a series of sightings on HMS Invincible were dismissed by senior officers as \"spurious\" and that no warning was passed to other ships in the Falklands task force. HMS Sheffield, only on half-alert and with its own radar not fully operational, got little more than a minute's warning. The attack caused the first mass British casualties of the south Atlantic war in 1982. Yesterday a former radar operator on the carrier, David Forster, 37, said the officer who decided not to warn the fleet should \"admit and explain\" his decision: \"I want him to apologise.\" He said the officer, in the Invincible electronic operations room, dismissed sightings by him and other operators by accusing them of \"chasing rabbits\". Mr Forster added that he personally felt he had \"let 20 men die\" by failing to insist that other ships were alerted. \"This has been on my mind for the last 18 years. \"I should have stood up and shouted, 'There's something coming in, believe me - alert the fleet.' I'll always punish myself in my conscience for the death of those men. The Sheffield was a sitting duck. It never had a chance to change course, fire its chaff [anti-radar foil] or even its missiles. Remorse and sadness lie heavy on my heart.\" The MoD ruled out an inquiry into the conduct of the officer responsible, whose identity has not yet been officially confirmed. \"No doubt the officer will still be thinking 'if only',\" a spokesman said. Remorse \"I don't think that blame is the word, given the set of circumstances. But that does not relieve him of a sense of personal and professional regret.\" Last night Des Keoghane, organiser of the Falklands Families Association, said, \"I have spoken to a parent of one of the Sheffield dead. He has not heard of this before - and neither have I.\" Invincible's then captain, Admiral Sir Jeremy Black, who rose to be home fleet commander-in-chief and an aide de camp to the Queen before retiring from the navy in 1992, declined to comment. The MoD confirmed the incident, on May 4, 1982, after a Guardian investigation into separate accounts from two ex-able seaman radar operators on the Invincible. The operators, now civilians, have not previously disclosed what happened Inquiries established that the incident was confirmed soon afterwards in the Falklands Deployment Book, a souvenir volume of recollections of Invincible's role in the south Atlantic written by officers. Circulated only to crew members in January 1983, six months after the liberation of the Falklands, it says the radar sightings were classified as \"spurious\". A Royal Navy Sea Harrier fighter was asked to check with its airborne radar \"but could find nothing\", the deployment book says. The Exocet hit the Sheffield 19 minutes after the first sighting by Invincible, according to its timetable of sightings. This crucial series of radar traces was not known to the eminent historian David Brown, formerly of the Royal Navy historical branch, when he wrote what the navy regards as the nearest thing to an official history of the conflict at sea. Mr Brown's book, The Royal Navy and the Falklands War, says that before the attack \"there were no bogeys [unidentified aircraft assumed to be hostile] on any of the radar screens\". Mr Brown notes that in previous days a series of radar false alarms had led to British warships being put on full action stations. His history says the Sheffield was first warned by another destroyer when the two Argentine Super Etendard attack planes - with top flying speeds of 733mph - were only 25 miles away. Her own radar was jammed because officers were making a satellite phone call to fleet headquarters in Northwood, London. They ended the call and spotted the Etendards on their radar 20 miles away. False alarms The planes fired Exocets from 12 miles away. One of them locked on to the Sheffield. It had \"little more than a minute's flying time to reach the Sheffield\", Mr Brown says. The only warning given to the crew was a Tannoyed shout: \"Missile attack - hit the deck\". At the time of the attack the Sheffield's unlucky crew was \"only in second degree readiness rather than at full action stations\", according to another history of the naval conflict. This was \"in order to give the crew a short respite. Electromagnetic interference from [the satellite phone] blanketed her detection gear\". The Exocet did not explode, but its friction caused a fuel explosion which swept the destroyer with flames and poisonous smoke. David Forster, who now lives in Victoria, Australia, said: \"In the task force we perfected a drill called Red Alpha which closes a ship down into full action stations and battle readiness in four minutes. \"Men are at their radar displays or manning their guns.

      "body": "<p>Margaret, friends,</p> <p>You have just heard from the man who has led Croatia away from the narrow politics of ethnic nationalism and put it on the path to modern European democracy.</p> <p>And now the people of Serbia also have voted to join modern Europe.</p> <p>With results in this morning from two thirds of the polling stations, the opposition are way ahead by 20 percentage points. In his home town, his own stronghold, Milosevic lost in every polling station. Even the army and the police, the backbone of his power, voted against him.</p> <p>Last night we saw tens of thousands of Serbs dancing on the streets of Belgrade with delight that he was overthrown.</p> <p>The only person who does not seem to know he lost is Milosevic himself. We know he was always planning to rig the central count. He had even written a new programme for the election computer and he didn't get it from elpac.</p> <p>But even Milosevic cannot conceal a defeat on this scale.</p> <p>Let's give Milosevic a clear message while he is trying to decide who won. Don't rob your people of their vote for change! Accept their verdict and go!</p> <p>We are on the verge of a new era for the Balkans. One that puts the politics of hate into history.</p> <p>It would not be happening if this government had not stood up to Milosevic when he attempted the brutal ethnic cleansing of Kosovo. We demonstrated that his fascism of ethnic cleansing belongs to Europe's past. We made it clear that we would not tolerate it returning to Europe's future.</p> <p>My regret is that the last Tory government wasted years in Bosnia refusing to stand up to ethnic cleansing. If they had shown the same resolve then Milosevic might have gone long before now.</p> <p>And now that the Tories are in opposition, they still refuse to stand up for human rights.</p> <p>Every now and again one of the press exposes that I travel more than any other cabinet member. One of them was gracious enough to say that at least as foreign secretary I had an excuse to travel.</p> <p>What I remember most from my official visits this year is not the capital cities.</p> <p>It is a camp I saw in Sierra Leone for 2,000 amputees. Every one of them a victim of rebel atrocities. Many of them children.</p> <p>Most of them had a hand lopped off. Some of them had lost both hands. Wherever I looked, I saw people holding out stumps, pleading for protection.</p> <p>The Tory defence spokesman has said we should withdraw from our commitment to Sierra Leone. I challenge him to go to that camp and tell those victims of the rebels that the Tories are in favour of abandoning them.</p> <p>We are in Sierra Leone out of simple human decency. We are there because it is in our interests that democratic government should not be overthrown by terrorism.</p> <p>We are there because we believe that everyone, whatever their colour, whatever their continent, has the same equal right to freedom that we have.</p> <p>When you look back over the past parliament, you can be proud of what your government has done around the world.</p> <p>Proud that across Africa and Asia there are villages with safe water, children with primary schools and mothers with health care, because Labour reversed the Tory aid cuts.</p> <p>Proud that it was the British ambassador who led the protest at the suppression of Aung San Suu Kyi.</p> <p>The Burmese military sent 200 riot police to detain one woman. That's how dangerous they find her ideas of freedom and democracy.</p> <p>Those are our values too. That's why we demand they set free Aung San Suu Kyi.</p> <p>Proud that it was your government that banned the export, import and production of landmines.</p> <p>I remember queuing up to hear Lord Justice Scott prising the truth out of the Tory government about their arms sales to Iraq. It gave me a lot of pleasure to hear him say that he had read Labour's annual report on arms exports, and he was \"amazed by the difference\".</p> <p>We have produced the fullest, most comprehensive annual report on arms exports of any country in Europe.</p> <p>We agreed a code of conduct on arms sales with the rest of the EU.</p> <p>One under which we all apply the same strong standards on human rights.</p> <p>One which for the first time gives us the right to object if any partner takes up an arms contract we refused.</p> <p>We have made sure that those who are denied the truth by their own government can hear it through us.</p> <p>On Thursday, Conference will hear Nelson Mandela, who was encarcerated for almost 30 years by the apartheid regime. Throughout those long years, his only window to the outside world was a radio which could receive the BBC World Service.</p> <p>Nelson Mandela would approve that your government has reversed the Tory vandalism of the World Service.</p> <p>Because of Labour's investment, it now reaches 150m people worldwide.</p> <p>That public diplomacy between peoples is just as important as the official diplomacy between governments.</p> <p>So that we can do both better, we have made the Foreign Office more representative of all the diversity of modern Britain.</p> <p>A 50% increase in staff from ethnic communities. A 100% increase in the number of women Ambassadors and heads of post.</p> <p>The Foreign Office should represent all the people of Britain. And should serve all the people of Britain.</p> <p>Every year tens of thousands of British Muslims go on the Haj pilgrimage to Mecca. This year Britain was the first western country to provide consular help on the Haj for British citizens.</p> <p>We have put human rights at the heart of our foreign policy.</p> <p>Last week's report on our record by Amnesty concluded: \"The balance sheet shows a record of real achievement\".</p> <p>But we have to be realistic. If we want to make a difference in the world, we cannot do it alone. We do it by setting the agenda in the unique range of international organisations to which Britain belongs. And that is what we have been doing.</p> <p>In the G8, where Britain has been in the lead in securing relief for the poorest countries burdened by debt. We are freeing those countries from the debts of their past so that they can afford to educate the children that are their future.</p> <p>At the UN, where Britain is leading the campaign to expose the illicit trade in diamonds from regions in conflict. The price of diamonds should not come with a cost in human life.</p> <p>In the Commonwealth, where under Labour Britain is now at one with our partners. In contrast to the Tories who made themselves a minority of one in opposing sanctions against apartheid.</p> <p>Partnership abroad is essential if we are to succeed at home.</p> <p>If we want to live in peace then we need to strengthen our alliances.</p> <p>If we want factories with full order books, then we need to widen our trade agreements.</p> <p>If we want to protect our national environment then, we need to negotiate global commitments to halt climate change.</p> <p>That is the way to promote Britain's interests. To work in partnership, to set the agenda. To find common cause with other countries.</p> <p>It comes easy to Labour to do that. Our movement is built on the principles of partnership, of solidarity, of cooperation.</p> <p>But that's not the Tory way. I have read their new international policy. It doesn't take long. One of the reasons it doesn't take long is that it does not mention a single one of those international organisations. Nothing on the G8. Nothing on the UN. Nothing on the Commonwealth.</p> <p>It is the first time in history that a party has tried to produce a foreign policy while trying to avoid working with foreigners. Especially if they're Europeans.</p> <p>Tory policy on Europe reveals no trace of being influenced by its impact on our 14 partners. But it might have been made up by someone under the influence of 14 pints. Or who had spent too much time reading the Europhobic press.</p> <p>Most of their stories about Europe seem come from an alternative planet. One known only to the Europhobic press. From that uncharted planet, all sorts of horrors emerge. They have threatened us: - that lollipop ladies will be harmonised; that darts will be banned from British pubs; and that rubber ducks will be banished from British bathtubs. Not one of them is true.</p> <p>Every day the Daily Mail has a fresh challenge for us. Today I give the Daily Mail a challenge.</p> <p>Tell your readers the truth about Europe. Tell them 3m British families depend for their living on exporting to Europe. Tell them five thousand American and Japanese companies have invested in Britain because we are in Europe.</p> <p>Tell them 2.5m people have the right to a paid holiday for the first time in their working lives thanks to the Working Time Directive. A measure opposed by the Tories. Brought in by Labour.</p> <p>Look. I'll let you into a secret. I never did much like the Tory party. But I'll say this for old Toryism. The Tory party of Heath, of Heseltine, of Ken Clarke was capable of recognising our national interest.</p> <p>The Tory party of Hague, of Redwood, of Portillo is too blinkered by party prejudice to see the national interest.</p> <p>One Tory frontbencher has said we should renegotiate our terms of membership or \"pull out if we cannot\".</p> <p>I have great respect for our partners in Europe. But confronted with Hague; Redwood; Portillo; Widdecombe - it is just possible our partners might be tempted to suggest they skip the renegotiation and go straight to pulling out.</p> <p>What saddens me most about Tory policy on Europe is that it is so defeatist. It assumes that Britain is so weak, so lacking in confidence that it will always lose out in Europe.</p> <p>Maybe it would under William Hague. But we have not let Britain lose out in Europe.</p> <p>Labour set the pace on economic reform in Lisbon earlier this year. We set Europe the goal of a knowledge economy as competitive, as innovative, as skilled as anywhere on the globe. And, for the first time in the history of the European Union we committed it to the goal of full employment.</p> <p>While the Tories are trying to work out how to leave Europe, all over central and eastern Europe people are queing up to join.</p> <p>Labour has made Britain the champion of enlargement. We reject the model of a fortress Europe which shuts out those new democracies from sharing our prosperity.</p> <p>What have the Tories done? They have promised a referendum on the treaty to prepare Europe for enlargement. And they have threatened to campaign against it. They could achieve the remarkable double of becoming as unpopular with the dozen candidate countries as they already are with the existing 14 member states. How dare they pose as advocates of referendums? In all their long years in power they never let the people have a referendum on anything. Now they are opposed to a referendum on the single currency.</p> <p>Labour will let the people decide. If we conclude that our five tests have been met, we will recommend in a referendum entry into the single currency.</p> <p>We will not let Britain lose out by staying out</p> <p>We know Britain must be in Europe. But we also know Europe needs reform. We want a more efficient commission.</p> <p>We want a more democratic Europe. We want a new role for national parliaments in European decision-making.</p> <p>And because we Labour respect in Europe we can take the lead in the reform of Europe.</p> <p>The stronger we are in Europe the stronger will be Britain's voice around the rest of the world.</p> <p>We have a full agenda on world issues for the next parliament.</p> <p>We will tackle the causes of conflict. The self-loading rifle has become the modern weapon of mass destruction. We will support an I international arms amnesty fund to offer development in return for the surrender of firearms.</p> <p>We will propose new rules to tackle the spread of missile technology.</p> <p>We will work to extend the code of conduct on arms sales to central Europe and to north America.</p> <p>We will get the International Criminal Court up and running. Never again will brutal dictators be able to commit crimes against humanity, knowing that there is no court to hold them to account.</p> <p>We will offer to establish in Britain a staff college for the UN on peacekeeping.</p> <p>We will demand reform of the security council. It must represent the world of the 21st century, not the world as it was in the middle of the last century.</p> <p>We will offer a new contract for the British Traveller. Using the latest in communications technology, it will guarantee 24-hour, seven-day access to help, wherever you are in the world.</p> <p>And we will appoint a special envoy on the death penalty. An advocate for the profound moral case against the judicial taking of human life.</p> <p>Those are our priorities for a second term. The priorities of a government that knows that Britain's security, prosperity, and democratic values are strengthened by a healthy international community.</p> <p>I see William Hague has called his new policy \"Believing in Britain\". What a miserable, shrivelled, shrunken thing is the Tory vision of Britain. A country hostile to its neighbours, frightened of foreigners and bigoted about people who come from other continents.</p> <p>We believe in Britain. But we believe in all of Britain. We will not accept sneers at overseas doctors who work hard for our hospitals. We enjoy living in a multi-cultural society. We welcome the strength it gives us in our relations around the world.</p> <p>We believe in British values. Freedom. Justice. Fairness. But we do not accept that those are values for Britain alone. If we want those rights for ourselves, then we should support those rights for others.</p> <p>We believe in a Britain that is comfortable with itself and with its place in the world. Not sliding into isolation. Opting out of its responsibilities. Surrendering its interests. We believe in a confident Britain that rises to its role in the world. A Britain that earns respect. That's the Britain we believe in.</p> <p>And that is what we will offer the people at the election. A Britain that is a leading partner in Europe and a force for good in the world.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Margaret, friends, You have just heard from the man who has led Croatia away from the narrow politics of ethnic nationalism and put it on the path to modern European democracy. And now the people of Serbia also have voted to join modern Europe. With results in this morning from two thirds of the polling stations, the opposition are way ahead by 20 percentage points. In his home town, his own stronghold, Milosevic lost in every polling station. Even the army and the police, the backbone of his power, voted against him. Last night we saw tens of thousands of Serbs dancing on the streets of Belgrade with delight that he was overthrown. The only person who does not seem to know he lost is Milosevic himself. We know he was always planning to rig the central count. He had even written a new programme for the election computer and he didn't get it from elpac. But even Milosevic cannot conceal a defeat on this scale. Let's give Milosevic a clear message while he is trying to decide who won. Don't rob your people of their vote for change! Accept their verdict and go! We are on the verge of a new era for the Balkans. One that puts the politics of hate into history. It would not be happening if this government had not stood up to Milosevic when he attempted the brutal ethnic cleansing of Kosovo. We demonstrated that his fascism of ethnic cleansing belongs to Europe's past. We made it clear that we would not tolerate it returning to Europe's future. My regret is that the last Tory government wasted years in Bosnia refusing to stand up to ethnic cleansing. If they had shown the same resolve then Milosevic might have gone long before now. And now that the Tories are in opposition, they still refuse to stand up for human rights. Every now and again one of the press exposes that I travel more than any other cabinet member. One of them was gracious enough to say that at least as foreign secretary I had an excuse to travel. What I remember most from my official visits this year is not the capital cities. It is a camp I saw in Sierra Leone for 2,000 amputees. Every one of them a victim of rebel atrocities. Many of them children. Most of them had a hand lopped off. Some of them had lost both hands. Wherever I looked, I saw people holding out stumps, pleading for protection. The Tory defence spokesman has said we should withdraw from our commitment to Sierra Leone. I challenge him to go to that camp and tell those victims of the rebels that the Tories are in favour of abandoning them. We are in Sierra Leone out of simple human decency. We are there because it is in our interests that democratic government should not be overthrown by terrorism. We are there because we believe that everyone, whatever their colour, whatever their continent, has the same equal right to freedom that we have. When you look back over the past parliament, you can be proud of what your government has done around the world. Proud that across Africa and Asia there are villages with safe water, children with primary schools and mothers with health care, because Labour reversed the Tory aid cuts. Proud that it was the British ambassador who led the protest at the suppression of Aung San Suu Kyi. The Burmese military sent 200 riot police to detain one woman. That's how dangerous they find her ideas of freedom and democracy. Those are our values too. That's why we demand they set free Aung San Suu Kyi. Proud that it was your government that banned the export, import and production of landmines. I remember queuing up to hear Lord Justice Scott prising the truth out of the Tory government about their arms sales to Iraq. It gave me a lot of pleasure to hear him say that he had read Labour's annual report on arms exports, and he was \"amazed by the difference\". We have produced the fullest, most comprehensive annual report on arms exports of any country in Europe. We agreed a code of conduct on arms sales with the rest of the EU. One under which we all apply the same strong standards on human rights. One which for the first time gives us the right to object if any partner takes up an arms contract we refused. We have made sure that those who are denied the truth by their own government can hear it through us. On Thursday, Conference will hear Nelson Mandela, who was encarcerated for almost 30 years by the apartheid regime. Throughout those long years, his only window to the outside world was a radio which could receive the BBC World Service. Nelson Mandela would approve that your government has reversed the Tory vandalism of the World Service. Because of Labour's investment, it now reaches 150m people worldwide. That public diplomacy between peoples is just as important as the official diplomacy between governments. So that we can do both better, we have made the Foreign Office more representative of all the diversity of modern Britain. A 50% increase in staff from ethnic communities. A 100% increase in the number of women Ambassadors and heads of post. The Foreign Office should represent all the people of Britain. And should serve all the people of Britain. Every year tens of thousands of British Muslims go on the Haj pilgrimage to Mecca. This year Britain was the first western country to provide consular help on the Haj for British citizens. We have put human rights at the heart of our foreign policy. Last week's report on our record by Amnesty concluded: \"The balance sheet shows a record of real achievement\". But we have to be realistic. If we want to make a difference in the world, we cannot do it alone. We do it by setting the agenda in the unique range of international organisations to which Britain belongs. And that is what we have been doing. In the G8, where Britain has been in the lead in securing relief for the poorest countries burdened by debt. We are freeing those countries from the debts of their past so that they can afford to educate the children that are their future. At the UN, where Britain is leading the campaign to expose the illicit trade in diamonds from regions in conflict. The price of diamonds should not come with a cost in human life. In the Commonwealth, where under Labour Britain is now at one with our partners. In contrast to the Tories who made themselves a minority of one in opposing sanctions against apartheid. Partnership abroad is essential if we are to succeed at home. If we want to live in peace then we need to strengthen our alliances. If we want factories with full order books, then we need to widen our trade agreements. If we want to protect our national environment then, we need to negotiate global commitments to halt climate change. That is the way to promote Britain's interests. To work in partnership, to set the agenda. To find common cause with other countries. It comes easy to Labour to do that. Our movement is built on the principles of partnership, of solidarity, of cooperation. But that's not the Tory way. I have read their new international policy. It doesn't take long. One of the reasons it doesn't take long is that it does not mention a single one of those international organisations. Nothing on the G8. Nothing on the UN. Nothing on the Commonwealth. It is the first time in history that a party has tried to produce a foreign policy while trying to avoid working with foreigners. Especially if they're Europeans. Tory policy on Europe reveals no trace of being influenced by its impact on our 14 partners. But it might have been made up by someone under the influence of 14 pints. Or who had spent too much time reading the Europhobic press. Most of their stories about Europe seem come from an alternative planet. One known only to the Europhobic press. From that uncharted planet, all sorts of horrors emerge. They have threatened us: - that lollipop ladies will be harmonised; that darts will be banned from British pubs; and that rubber ducks will be banished from British bathtubs. Not one of them is true. Every day the Daily Mail has a fresh challenge for us. Today I give the Daily Mail a challenge. Tell your readers the truth about Europe. Tell them 3m British families depend for their living on exporting to Europe. Tell them five thousand American and Japanese companies have invested in Britain because we are in Europe. Tell them 2.5m people have the right to a paid holiday for the first time in their working lives thanks to the Working Time Directive. A measure opposed by the Tories. Brought in by Labour. Look. I'll let you into a secret. I never did much like the Tory party. But I'll say this for old Toryism. The Tory party of Heath, of Heseltine, of Ken Clarke was capable of recognising our national interest. The Tory party of Hague, of Redwood, of Portillo is too blinkered by party prejudice to see the national interest. One Tory frontbencher has said we should renegotiate our terms of membership or \"pull out if we cannot\". I have great respect for our partners in Europe. But confronted with Hague; Redwood; Portillo; Widdecombe - it is just possible our partners might be tempted to suggest they skip the renegotiation and go straight to pulling out. What saddens me most about Tory policy on Europe is that it is so defeatist. It assumes that Britain is so weak, so lacking in confidence that it will always lose out in Europe. Maybe it would under William Hague. But we have not let Britain lose out in Europe. Labour set the pace on economic reform in Lisbon earlier this year. We set Europe the goal of a knowledge economy as competitive, as innovative, as skilled as anywhere on the globe. And, for the first time in the history of the European Union we committed it to the goal of full employment. While the Tories are trying to work out how to leave Europe, all over central and eastern Europe people are queing up to join. Labour has made Britain the champion of enlargement. We reject the model of a fortress Europe which shuts out those new democracies from sharing our prosperity. What have the Tories done? They have promised a referendum on the treaty to prepare Europe for enlargement. And they have threatened to campaign against it. They could achieve the remarkable double of becoming as unpopular with the dozen candidate countries as they already are with the existing 14 member states. How dare they pose as advocates of referendums? In all their long years in power they never let the people have a referendum on anything. Now they are opposed to a referendum on the single currency. Labour will let the people decide. If we conclude that our five tests have been met, we will recommend in a referendum entry into the single currency. We will not let Britain lose out by staying out We know Britain must be in Europe. But we also know Europe needs reform. We want a more efficient commission. We want a more democratic Europe. We want a new role for national parliaments in European decision-making. And because we Labour respect in Europe we can take the lead in the reform of Europe. The stronger we are in Europe the stronger will be Britain's voice around the rest of the world. We have a full agenda on world issues for the next parliament. We will tackle the causes of conflict. The self-loading rifle has become the modern weapon of mass destruction. We will support an I international arms amnesty fund to offer development in return for the surrender of firearms. We will propose new rules to tackle the spread of missile technology. We will work to extend the code of conduct on arms sales to central Europe and to north America. We will get the International Criminal Court up and running. Never again will brutal dictators be able to commit crimes against humanity, knowing that there is no court to hold them to account. We will offer to establish in Britain a staff college for the UN on peacekeeping. We will demand reform of the security council. It must represent the world of the 21st century, not the world as it was in the middle of the last century. We will offer a new contract for the British Traveller. Using the latest in communications technology, it will guarantee 24-hour, seven-day access to help, wherever you are in the world. And we will appoint a special envoy on the death penalty. An advocate for the profound moral case against the judicial taking of human life. Those are our priorities for a second term. The priorities of a government that knows that Britain's security, prosperity, and democratic values are strengthened by a healthy international community. I see William Hague has called his new policy \"Believing in Britain\". What a miserable, shrivelled, shrunken thing is the Tory vision of Britain. A country hostile to its neighbours, frightened of foreigners and bigoted about people who come from other continents. We believe in Britain. But we believe in all of Britain. We will not accept sneers at overseas doctors who work hard for our hospitals. We enjoy living in a multi-cultural society. We welcome the strength it gives us in our relations around the world. We believe in British values. Freedom. Justice. Fairness. But we do not accept that those are values for Britain alone. If we want those rights for ourselves, then we should support those rights for others. We believe in a Britain that is comfortable with itself and with its place in the world. Not sliding into isolation. Opting out of its responsibilities. Surrendering its interests. We believe in a confident Britain that rises to its role in the world. A Britain that earns respect. That's the Britain we believe in. And that is what we will offer the people at the election. A Britain that is a leading partner in Europe and a force for good in the world.",

The prime minister admitted he had \"made people angry\" over his handling of the fuel crisis, pensions and the Millennium Dome. In his keynote speech to the Labour party conference in Brighton, Mr Blair conceded that the government had suffered in the opinion polls over these issues. But he reminded the party faithful that Labour had created 1m jobs, increased public spending and strengthened the economy. He told delegates in Brighton he wanted to set out the big choices facing Britain. \"After the events of two weeks ago, it's no wonder the government has taken a knock,\" he said. \"It happened on my watch and I take responsibility.\" In a conciliatory gesture, Mr Blair said: \"There are things we have done that have made people angry and we should be open enough to admit it.\" He said he should have listened to people's \"agony\" over fuel duty - but added that he was also listening to those who wanted an increase in NHS spending, extra investment in schools, more police on the beat and better public transport. \"I owe you an explanation.

      "body": "<a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/labour2000/story/0,7369,373638,00.html\">Blair's speech, part one: 'It's no wonder the government has taken a knock'</a> <p>Today I make a further commitment. </p> <p> Line one of the contract in the next manifesto will be a promise to increase the share of our national wealth spent on education in the next Parliament. </p> <p> Education. Education. Education. Then. Now. And in the future. </p> <p> Again, on health, let me set out the scale of our plans, for now and for a second term. </p> <p> The waiting list pledge has been met. </p> <p> There are 10,000 more nurses in the NHS. </p> <p> Every A&amp;E that needs it is being modernised. </p> <p> The biggest ever hospital building programme is under way. </p> <p> But we all know. 18 years of neglect isn't put right in three years. </p> <p> Earlier this year we got the money to plan for a five year record rise in NHS spending. But we are New Labour. We don't just spend. </p> <p> Alan Milburn and I sat down with people in the NHS and said it's a deal: we provide the cash, you rise to the challenge of modernising the NHS. They responded magnificently. </p> <p> Our NHS plan is something the party can be proud of. The NHS was the greatest achievement of the post-war Labour government. It was based on a single, clear, enduring value: that healthcare should be based on need not ability to pay. Some objected to that principle then. Some urge us to abandon it now. But this party, the Labour party will never abandon what was one of the greatest civilising acts of emancipation this country has ever known. </p> <p> Under the plan, for the first time a system of inspection and accountability for all parts of the NHS, with new money to reward good performance. </p> <p> For the first time, nurses and other health professionals given the bigger roles that their qualifications and expertise deserve. </p> <p> For the first time local health services and local social services brought closer together in one organisation. </p> <p> For the first time, the NHS and the private sector in a proper partnership to deliver healthcare. </p> <p> For the first time, money set aside specifically to get rid of the dirty corridors, the poor food, the mixed sex wards which demoralise patients and staff. </p> <p> For the first time, new consultants trained within the NHS, paid for by the taxpayer, will give the early years of their service exclusively to National Health Service patients. </p> <p> Today, as we set out the next steps, I want to focus on cancer. </p> <p> There will be nobody in this hall, or watching from their homes, who has not seen a friend or family member struck down by cancer. </p> <p> As things stand, one in every four people in this country will die of cancer. </p> <p> Under the plan we publish tomorrow, there will be 1000 more cancer specialists over the next six years - up nearly a third. </p> <p> 295 new scanners and radio-therapy machines so that for the first time the NHS can meet proper equipment standards for diagnosing and treating cancer. </p> <p> By 2003 for the first time the government will be matching pound for pound charity funding for cancer research. </p> <p> Cancer patients in all parts of the country will get the right drugs at the right time, regardless of where they live. The postcode lottery ended. Waiting times will be cut. Maximum two weeks from GP appointment to first hospital appointment for suspected urgent cases. And, as we increase the number of specialists, a maximum wait of one month from diagnosis to treatment starting. </p> <p> And because breast cancer kills 11,000 women every year, because it causes so much pain and suffering among Britain's families, we will extend breast cancer screening to all women aged over 65, helping an extra 400,000 women by 2004. </p> <p> Then on transport, in July John Prescott and Gus Macdonald set out in detail Britain's first ever transport plan, a unique 10 year \u00a3180 billion partnership between public and private sector to renew our transport system. </p> <p> A massive programme for the second term. It will take time. Investment. And a Labour government to see it through. </p> <p> The Conservatives have made their choice. </p> <p> They are committed to \u00a316bn of cuts in our investment. </p> <p> When they made this commitment, I asked for research on what sort of things you'd have to cut over a 12 month period to deliver on a \u00a316bn cuts guarantee. Back came the answer. </p> <p> 20,000 doctors. Cut. </p> <p> Plus 20,000 prison officers. Cut. </p> <p> Plus 40,000 nurses. Cut. </p> <p> Plus 40,000 teachers. Cut. </p> <p> Plus 40,000 police officers. Cut under the Tory cuts guarantee. </p> <p> And then: 20 hospitals. Shut. </p> <p> 150 secondary schools. Shut. 500 primary schools. Shut under the Tory cuts guarantee. </p> <p> And we've still got five billion pounds to go. How will they get there? </p> <p> The biggest ever rise in child benefit. Cut. </p> <p> Free TV licences for 3 million pensioners. Cut. </p> <p> The \u00a3150 winter fuel allowance. Cut under the Tory cuts guarantee. </p> <p> 1200 intensive care beds. Cut. </p> <p> Free eye tests for pensioners. Cut. 250 cancer scanners. Cut. </p> <p> Half a million nursery places. Cut. 100,000 childcare places. Cut under the Tory cuts guarantee. </p> <p> And just to round it up to \u00a316 billion, the country's entire arts and sports budget. Cut under the Tory cuts guarantee. </p> <p> And in every constituency, in every part of this country, we will force every Tory candidate to say where the cuts will fall. </p> <p> The fourth big choice: a government with the strength to build strong communities, or a government that believes there is no such thing in society. </p> <p> Crime, anti-social behaviour, racial intolerance, drug abuse, destroy families and communities. They destroy the very respect for others on which society is founded. They blight the life chances of thousands of young people and the quality of life of millions more. </p> <p> Fail to confront this evil and we will never build a Britain where everyone can succeed. </p> <p> So we invest to give opportunity. Not just in jobs and services. </p> <p> Today we set out plans to invest \u00a3750million of lottery money in schools and community sport as part of a \u00a31billion investment over three years. </p> <p> It's a policy we have put together with Trevor Brooking, chairman of Sport England, who has flown here from Sydney and who believes passionately, as I do, that this is not just a sports policy. It's a health policy, an education policy, an anti-crime policy, an anti-drugs policy. </p> <p> By acknowledging the duty to care, we earn the right to be tough on crime. 4 out of 10 violent crimes are alcohol related. Half of property crime drug-related. </p> <p> It is time for zero tolerance of the yob culture. </p> <p> Time to stand up for the pensioner afraid to go out. Time to stand up for the single mothers scared to walk to the shops. Time to stand up to the thugs and the bullies. </p> <p> Time to tighten bail to deal with the absurdity of people released in the morning committing offences in the afternoon. Time to give the police powers to close pubs where there is fighting. </p> <p> Time to give them powers to ban drink in public places. </p> <p> Time to give them the power to impose curfews on children up to 16 and time to use them. </p> <p> Time to give them the power without the hassle of endless forms and court bureaucracy, to issue fixed penalty fines for loutish behaviour. </p> <p> Time to give offenders on drugs a choice: get treatment or lose your liberty because society needs protection from you. </p> <p> These measures require legislation. So will the new and sweeping powers we intend to give to the police and customs to investigate organised crime and to confiscate their assets. </p> <p> If they need further powers, they will get them. </p> <p> You don't beat today's drug gangs by applying the Queensberry rules. It is time the law enforcement agencies were able to do as much damage to organised crime as organised crime does to our communities. </p> <p> We have increased funding for victim support, and given special help to victims of rape and sexual offences, but we need to do more. </p> <p> - They should get full information about the progress of the case. </p> <p> - About the sentence, and about the release of the criminal. </p> <p> - Proper compensation, backed by a Victims' Ombudsman. </p> <p> And, I believe that the victim of a crime should be able to give a written assessment of the impact of the crime upon them, which should be presented in open court, and taken into account when sentencing decisions are made. </p> <p> Standing up to criminals. Standing up for victims. Another big project for the second term of a Labour government. </p> <p> The fifth choice: a government that leads in the world, or a government that retreats into isolation. </p> <p> This is a world moving closer together. In money and trade; the environment; defence and security; the war against drugs and crime; even today the call for lower oil prices: strength comes through partnership; influence through international engagement. </p> <p> Standing up for Britain means standing up for our armed services. </p> <p> Standing up for Britain means know we are stronger with the US if we are stronger in Europe, and stronger in Europe if we are stronger with the US. </p> <p> Standing up for Britain means standing up for British jobs and British industry. </p> <p> On the Euro, standing up for Britain means taking the decision in the interests of Britain, not the interests of the internal warfare inside the Tory party. </p> <p> I believe we should join if the economics are right. At present, they aren't. </p> <p> But the choice at the election is not whether we join: that decision is for the people in a referendum. </p> <p> The issue is: do we rule out joining? </p> <p> Do we rule out even the option? </p> <p> How is that standing up for Britain, Britain's jobs, Britain's industry, the living standards of Britain's people? </p> <p> And standing up for Britain means standing up for our values overseas, in Sierra Leone, in Kosovo. </p> <p> And I say to Milosevic. You lost. Go. Your country and the world has suffered enough. </p> <p> These are the choices we make. </p> <p> These are our second term plans. </p> <p> A ten year plan for a modern NHS. The transformation of secondary education. </p> <p> A cradle to grave poverty strategy. </p> <p> A plan to harness new technology to spread prosperity to all. A plan to make our streets safe and our society strong. A 10 year plan for modern transport. </p> <p> The next steps to full employment. </p> <p> This is a programme worth fighting for. A second term more radical than the first. A quickening of the pace of reform. The next steps on our journey. All based on our enduring mission, to offer everyone, not just the privileged few, the chance to succeed. </p> <p> And lighting our path is this belief: that today a strong economy and a strong society are two sides of the same coin. </p> <p> To succeed as an economy we develop the talents of all. </p> <p> To be a fair society, we give opportunity to all. </p> <p> The political consequences are historic; self-interest and the common good are at long last in alliance. </p> <p> Look at the irony of the Tory years. </p> <p> The Tories who said only they could manage the economy ended up with boom and bust. </p> <p> The Tory party that said it would get tough on benefit claimants, ended up spending more on social security than schools and hospitals put together. </p> <p> The Tory party that said it would stand up for the family, presided over more instability, more single parents on benefit, more truancy, more juvenile crime than any in history. </p> <p> Why? Because they offered short-term tax cuts that could not be sustained rather than investing for the long-term. </p> <p> Because they thought there was no such thing as society. </p> <p> In the world of the 80s that might have been cruel; in the 21st century it simply won't work. </p> <p> Do you know how much we save from almost 1 million fewer welfare claimants since we took power. \u00a34 billion per annum. Enough for 75,000 nurses and 70,000 teachers. </p> <p> Do you know how much it would cost to take out private medical insurance, as the Tories want? Over \u00a31500 a year for the average family. </p> <p> Do you know the cost to the British economy of transport congestion a year? The equivalent of 8p on your income tax. </p> <p> Do you know why we say this is a learn more, earn more world? Because a graduate earns 40 % more than the average. </p> <p> On your side for the Tories means nodding along with your prejudices - English language lessons for foreign doctors - you know they're not talking about the Swiss. </p> <p> But really being on your side is to be there with you on the big questions, on the fundamentals. </p> <p> What began as a moral crusade is now also the path to prosperity. What started as a belief in the equal worth of all is also a programme for wealth creation. </p> <p> Realism and idealism at last in harmony. </p> <p> So when the Tories say: we'll cut Labour's investment and give you tax cuts, it's a fool's game. We will cut tax for people as we can, but will do it in a way that lasts not at the expense of the very stability and investment on which the wealth and security of millions of families depend. </p> <p> So that is my explanation. That's why I won't take the easy way. Because that way we cannot reach our journey's end. </p> <p> And all that really stands between us and our destination is confidence. And trust. </p> <p> The confidence that gives us strength to make the choices; the trust that there is a vision, an end to believe in. </p> <p> Don't tell me that a country with our history and heritage, that today boasts six of the top ten businesses in the whole of Europe, with London the top business city in Europe, that is a world leader in technology and communication and the businesses of the future, that under us has overtaken France and Italy to become the fourth largest economy in the world, that has the language of the new economy, more brilliant artists, actors and directors than any comparable country in the world, some of the best scientists and inventors in the world, the best armed forces in the world, the best teachers and doctors and nurses, the best people any nation could wish for. </p> <p> Don't tell me with all that going for us that we do not have the spirit to meet all the challenges before us. </p> <p> For that is another choice; confidence or cynicism. All we need is the confidence to make the right choice for the future. </p> <p> Just as we did in the party so, on a larger scale, the same is true for Britain. We are on a journey of renewal. Before us lies a path strewn with the challenges of change. </p> <p> But the purpose of our journey is not to lose our values as a nation: but to make them live on. </p> <p> And for us, this government, this party that believes passionately in a Britain where everyone not just a few get a chance to succeed, and knows the Tories will only take us backwards, we now know: </p> <p> We are in a fight and it's a fight I relish. </p> <p> For it is a fight for the future, the heart and the soul of our country. </p> <p> A fight for fairness. A fight for jobs. A fight for our schools. A fight for our hospitals. A fight for a new vision in which the old conflict between prosperity and social justice is finally banished to the history books in which it belongs. </p> <p> We do not lie down in the testing times. </p> <p> We hold firm. We listen and we lead. </p> <p> We can be confident in our policies, confident in the record we will put before the British people. </p> <p> Confident that we will repay the trust the British people put in us. </p> <p> Confident that we share their basic decent instincts and values. </p> <p> Confident that we are winning the big arguments on the big issues. </p> <p> Stability. Or boom and bust. </p> <p> Jobs. Or unemployment. </p> <p> Investment in schools and hospitals. Or cuts. </p> <p> Leadership and engagement in the world. Or weakness and sour isolation. </p> <p> Our journey's end: a Britain where any child born in this millennium, whatever their background, race or creed, wherever they live, whoever their parents, is able to make the most of the God-given ability they bring into this world. </p> <p> That journey is a journey worth making. </p> <p> A fight worth fighting. </p> <p> A fight we must win.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Blair's speech, part one: 'It's no wonder the government has taken a knock' Today I make a further commitment. Line one of the contract in the next manifesto will be a promise to increase the share of our national wealth spent on education in the next Parliament. Education. Education. Education. Then. Now. And in the future. Again, on health, let me set out the scale of our plans, for now and for a second term. The waiting list pledge has been met. There are 10,000 more nurses in the NHS. Every A&amp;E that needs it is being modernised. The biggest ever hospital building programme is under way. But we all know. 18 years of neglect isn't put right in three years. Earlier this year we got the money to plan for a five year record rise in NHS spending. But we are New Labour. We don't just spend. Alan Milburn and I sat down with people in the NHS and said it's a deal: we provide the cash, you rise to the challenge of modernising the NHS. They responded magnificently. Our NHS plan is something the party can be proud of. The NHS was the greatest achievement of the post-war Labour government. It was based on a single, clear, enduring value: that healthcare should be based on need not ability to pay. Some objected to that principle then. Some urge us to abandon it now. But this party, the Labour party will never abandon what was one of the greatest civilising acts of emancipation this country has ever known. Under the plan, for the first time a system of inspection and accountability for all parts of the NHS, with new money to reward good performance. For the first time, nurses and other health professionals given the bigger roles that their qualifications and expertise deserve. For the first time local health services and local social services brought closer together in one organisation. For the first time, the NHS and the private sector in a proper partnership to deliver healthcare. For the first time, money set aside specifically to get rid of the dirty corridors, the poor food, the mixed sex wards which demoralise patients and staff. For the first time, new consultants trained within the NHS, paid for by the taxpayer, will give the early years of their service exclusively to National Health Service patients. Today, as we set out the next steps, I want to focus on cancer. There will be nobody in this hall, or watching from their homes, who has not seen a friend or family member struck down by cancer. As things stand, one in every four people in this country will die of cancer. Under the plan we publish tomorrow, there will be 1000 more cancer specialists over the next six years - up nearly a third. 295 new scanners and radio-therapy machines so that for the first time the NHS can meet proper equipment standards for diagnosing and treating cancer. By 2003 for the first time the government will be matching pound for pound charity funding for cancer research. Cancer patients in all parts of the country will get the right drugs at the right time, regardless of where they live. The postcode lottery ended. Waiting times will be cut. Maximum two weeks from GP appointment to first hospital appointment for suspected urgent cases. And, as we increase the number of specialists, a maximum wait of one month from diagnosis to treatment starting. And because breast cancer kills 11,000 women every year, because it causes so much pain and suffering among Britain's families, we will extend breast cancer screening to all women aged over 65, helping an extra 400,000 women by 2004. Then on transport, in July John Prescott and Gus Macdonald set out in detail Britain's first ever transport plan, a unique 10 year \u00a3180 billion partnership between public and private sector to renew our transport system. A massive programme for the second term. It will take time. Investment. And a Labour government to see it through. The Conservatives have made their choice. They are committed to \u00a316bn of cuts in our investment. When they made this commitment, I asked for research on what sort of things you'd have to cut over a 12 month period to deliver on a \u00a316bn cuts guarantee. Back came the answer. 20,000 doctors. Cut. Plus 20,000 prison officers. Cut. Plus 40,000 nurses. Cut. Plus 40,000 teachers. Cut. Plus 40,000 police officers. Cut under the Tory cuts guarantee. And then: 20 hospitals. Shut. 150 secondary schools. Shut. 500 primary schools. Shut under the Tory cuts guarantee. And we've still got five billion pounds to go. How will they get there? The biggest ever rise in child benefit. Cut. Free TV licences for 3 million pensioners. Cut. The \u00a3150 winter fuel allowance. Cut under the Tory cuts guarantee. 1200 intensive care beds. Cut. Free eye tests for pensioners. Cut. 250 cancer scanners. Cut. Half a million nursery places. Cut. 100,000 childcare places. Cut under the Tory cuts guarantee. And just to round it up to \u00a316 billion, the country's entire arts and sports budget. Cut under the Tory cuts guarantee. And in every constituency, in every part of this country, we will force every Tory candidate to say where the cuts will fall. The fourth big choice: a government with the strength to build strong communities, or a government that believes there is no such thing in society. Crime, anti-social behaviour, racial intolerance, drug abuse, destroy families and communities. They destroy the very respect for others on which society is founded. They blight the life chances of thousands of young people and the quality of life of millions more. Fail to confront this evil and we will never build a Britain where everyone can succeed. So we invest to give opportunity. Not just in jobs and services. Today we set out plans to invest \u00a3750million of lottery money in schools and community sport as part of a \u00a31billion investment over three years. It's a policy we have put together with Trevor Brooking, chairman of Sport England, who has flown here from Sydney and who believes passionately, as I do, that this is not just a sports policy. It's a health policy, an education policy, an anti-crime policy, an anti-drugs policy. By acknowledging the duty to care, we earn the right to be tough on crime. 4 out of 10 violent crimes are alcohol related. Half of property crime drug-related. It is time for zero tolerance of the yob culture. Time to stand up for the pensioner afraid to go out. Time to stand up for the single mothers scared to walk to the shops. Time to stand up to the thugs and the bullies. Time to tighten bail to deal with the absurdity of people released in the morning committing offences in the afternoon. Time to give the police powers to close pubs where there is fighting. Time to give them powers to ban drink in public places. Time to give them the power to impose curfews on children up to 16 and time to use them. Time to give them the power without the hassle of endless forms and court bureaucracy, to issue fixed penalty fines for loutish behaviour. Time to give offenders on drugs a choice: get treatment or lose your liberty because society needs protection from you. These measures require legislation. So will the new and sweeping powers we intend to give to the police and customs to investigate organised crime and to confiscate their assets. If they need further powers, they will get them. You don't beat today's drug gangs by applying the Queensberry rules. It is time the law enforcement agencies were able to do as much damage to organised crime as organised crime does to our communities. We have increased funding for victim support, and given special help to victims of rape and sexual offences, but we need to do more. - They should get full information about the progress of the case. - About the sentence, and about the release of the criminal. - Proper compensation, backed by a Victims' Ombudsman. And, I believe that the victim of a crime should be able to give a written assessment of the impact of the crime upon them, which should be presented in open court, and taken into account when sentencing decisions are made. Standing up to criminals. Standing up for victims. Another big project for the second term of a Labour government. The fifth choice: a government that leads in the world, or a government that retreats into isolation. This is a world moving closer together. In money and trade; the environment; defence and security; the war against drugs and crime; even today the call for lower oil prices: strength comes through partnership; influence through international engagement. Standing up for Britain means standing up for our armed services. Standing up for Britain means know we are stronger with the US if we are stronger in Europe, and stronger in Europe if we are stronger with the US. Standing up for Britain means standing up for British jobs and British industry. On the Euro, standing up for Britain means taking the decision in the interests of Britain, not the interests of the internal warfare inside the Tory party. I believe we should join if the economics are right. At present, they aren't. But the choice at the election is not whether we join: that decision is for the people in a referendum. The issue is: do we rule out joining? Do we rule out even the option? How is that standing up for Britain, Britain's jobs, Britain's industry, the living standards of Britain's people? And standing up for Britain means standing up for our values overseas, in Sierra Leone, in Kosovo. And I say to Milosevic. You lost. Go. Your country and the world has suffered enough.

Our journey's end: a Britain where any child born in this millennium, whatever their background, race or creed, wherever they live, whoever their parents, is able to make the most of the God-given ability they bring into this world. That journey is a journey worth making. A fight worth fighting. A fight we must win.",

One thing on their minds - the blockading of the IMF and World Bank meetings. </p> <p>We arrive in the square at 9.30. Spirits are high - there are people with painted faces and ingenious costumes, old friends greeting each other, rousing speeches, music, and very few police. At 11, coloured flags appear, and groups follow their favourite flag onto the narrow cobbled streets. I follow the Pink flags. </p> <p>And still no police.</p> <p>Excitement infects the crowd, when we realise we might even get close to where the IMF and World Bank delegates are meeting.</p> <p>At the bridge, some two thousand protesters come to a halt. Around 200 journalists separate us and the police. The police have their banners too. \"Citizens. This is an illegal protest. Disperse, or action will be taken.\" Behind them a line of riot police. Behind the police a line of tanks. Behind the tanks, water cannon, more police, more vans.</p> <p>And so a stand-off ensues. Three hours.</p> <p>Some attempt to charge but they are no match for a tank. A few broken placards are thrown. Police reply with CS gas. Otherwise, the stand-off is peaceful. At three, the protesters disperse - tired, disappointed, but scheming for tonight - the main banquet for World Bank delegates is taking place at the Opera House.</p> <p>As I write, news comes in on the internet of other protests taking place around Prague. From our standoff on the bridge we see smoke rising from the right. We hear loud bangs coming from the left. </p> <p>The BBC website talks of violence, Molatov Cocktails, injured police and protesters - we, by far the biggest group, have seen none of this. The Czech capital is quiet as five pm approaches. The Pink group are discussing their next step. How can we get closer to the delegates? How can we form an agreement between the Socialists and Anarchists? Have those three coaches from the UK, who were stopped at the Czech border, got through yet? </p> <p>Tensions are high, spirits are low. We feel isolated from the world, who are reporting violence when little has taken place. We feel cheated - unable to get close to those we want to hear us.</p> <p>Tonight we will march again. We hope to disturb the IMF banquet. It should be a noisy demo - over their canapes and champagne - we want them to at least know we are there.</p>",

      "bodyText": "We were awoken at six am by the police helicopter buzzing overhead. One thousand campers at the Strahov Stadium. One thing on their minds - the blockading of the IMF and World Bank meetings. We arrive in the square at 9.30. Spirits are high - there are people with painted faces and ingenious costumes, old friends greeting each other, rousing speeches, music, and very few police. At 11, coloured flags appear, and groups follow their favourite flag onto the narrow cobbled streets. I follow the Pink flags. And still no police. Excitement infects the crowd, when we realise we might even get close to where the IMF and World Bank delegates are meeting. At the bridge, some two thousand protesters come to a halt. Around 200 journalists separate us and the police. The police have their banners too. \"Citizens. This is an illegal protest. Disperse, or action will be taken.\" Behind them a line of riot police. Behind the police a line of tanks. Behind the tanks, water cannon, more police, more vans. And so a stand-off ensues. Three hours. Some attempt to charge but they are no match for a tank. A few broken placards are thrown. Police reply with CS gas. Otherwise, the stand-off is peaceful. At three, the protesters disperse - tired, disappointed, but scheming for tonight - the main banquet for World Bank delegates is taking place at the Opera House. As I write, news comes in on the internet of other protests taking place around Prague. From our standoff on the bridge we see smoke rising from the right. We hear loud bangs coming from the left. The BBC website talks of violence, Molatov Cocktails, injured police and protesters - we, by far the biggest group, have seen none of this. The Czech capital is quiet as five pm approaches. The Pink group are discussing their next step. How can we get closer to the delegates? How can we form an agreement between the Socialists and Anarchists? Have those three coaches from the UK, who were stopped at the Czech border, got through yet? Tensions are high, spirits are low. We feel isolated from the world, who are reporting violence when little has taken place. We feel cheated - unable to get close to those we want to hear us. Tonight we will march again. We hope to disturb the IMF banquet. It should be a noisy demo - over their canapes and champagne - we want them to at least know we are there.",

For the next two or three years we could afford it; but 10, 15 years down the line, it would have imposed a huge financial burden on a future generation that would have been unfair to them.</p> <p>We want to do more for middle and lower income pensioners. You do not meet long term need by giving the wealthiest the same help as the poorest.</p> <p>But I know there are pensioners not on benefit, who have saved all their lives but are not by any stretch of the imagination wealthy, and for whom the basic state pension and other government help is essential. It is right they share in the nation's wealth.</p> <p>I am listening. I hear. And I will act.</p> <p>The point I'm making is this.</p> <p>The real world is full of competing causes.</p> <p>Most of them good.</p> <p>Most of them deserving.</p> <p>Many of them heart-rending.</p> <p>And it's not an arrogant government that chooses priorities.</p> <p>It's an irresponsible government that fails to choose.</p> <p>The test of leadership in politics is not how eloquently you say yes.</p> <p>It's how you explain why you're saying no.</p> <p>To be in touch is to be in sympathy.</p> <p>To be in government is to decide.</p> <p>And would it ever be right to choose a priority simply on the basis of a fuel blockade? What of those who can't protest; whose voice isn't supported by the media; who go neglected unless we speak for them?</p> <p>So I am listening.</p> <p>But I was also elected to lead.</p> <p>And if we want to reach our journey's end - that strong, fair and prosperous Britain for all - there are choices to be made.</p> <p>There are forks in the road, where which way we take determines the future lives of millions of people. They are decisions of destiny and I would like to explain them.</p> <p>The first big choice: a government with the strength to deliver stability, or a government that takes the country back to boom and bust.</p> <p>Without economic strength, there will never be a Britain where everyone can succeed.</p> <p>Remember the late 80s/early 90s, interest rates at 10% for four years, 15% for a year. One million families in negative equity. Record repossessions.</p> <p>Contrary to the myth, we inherited an economy trapped in a cycle of boom and bust; interest rates above those in our main competitors; and a big budget deficit.</p> <p>That was them after 18 years. After 3 years of us, ask yourselves this. Why has this country now got the lowest inflation rate in Europe?</p> <p>Employment and vacancies at record levels?</p> <p>The budget deficit, turned into the highest surplus in any major European country?</p> <p>It is not luck that we enjoy this economic strength. It is not coincidence.</p> <p>It is the result of choices, hard choices, taken by this government. By Gordon Brown, one of the most inspired chancellors this country has seen. Bank of England independence. Opposed by the Conservatives.</p> <p>Sorting out the nation's finances. Opposed by the Conservatives.</p> <p>The cheek of these Tories arguing about how we spend the surplus.</p> <p>Let us remind them.</p> <p>In May 1997, we didn't have a surplus. We had a national debt so large we were paying as much in interest payments on the debt as on schools and police put together.</p> <p>Today the Tories are back with exactly the plan of 10 years ago.</p> <p>You don't need me to predict it. We all experienced it. Don't ever let them con us into boom and bust again.</p> <p>The second big choice: a government with the strength to help people through change, or a government that leaves you to fend for yourself.</p> <p>Never forget: in 18 Tory years, unemployment trebled. Families of three generations with nobody bringing in a wage. Record youth unemployment. And what did they say: it was a price worth paying.</p> <p>Unemployment is never a price worth paying.</p> <p>The New Deal has helped nearly a million people with work or training, the largest ever jobs programme Britain has seen.</p> <p>The Working Families' Tax Credit makes work pay for over a million families. Childcare and training has helped 150,000 women find work or get a better job.</p> <p>A women wrote to me recently and said that, for the first time in her life, thanks to the Working Families' Tax Credit, she could afford a holiday and thanks to the Social Chapter, she was entitled to one.</p> <p>And at long last a national statutory minimum wage has given 1\u00bd million people the dignity of a decent living wage.</p> <p>And we have introduced the democratic right, delivered after 100 years of trying, to be represented by a trade union should you want it.</p> <p>That was our choice. Not to leave you at the mercy of markets. Not to walk by. Not to say: tough, sink or swim.</p> <p>Every single one of those measures was opposed by the Conservatives.</p> <p>Every single one fought against, tooth and nail.</p> <p>That was their choice. And though they say they support the national minimum wage now, does anyone believe them? Their policies may change every five minutes. Their prejudices will never change.</p> <p>And in the next stage we need to do more. Because the pace of change will quicken. It's not just poorer families that need help. To give everyone the chance to succeed, right in the heartlands of middle Britain, there are families and businesses that will need that helping hand.</p> <p>And because of the scale of what we are doing, and the scale of our ambition, let me set out in detail what we are doing, and what we will do in the future.</p> <p>Because 90% of new jobs will need skills with computers, there will be 6000 centres round Britain, giving access to the internet and help with technology. Everyone will get an 80% discount on computer courses, the unemployed will get it for free. There will be 1000 more technology centres for small businesses or the self-employed.</p> <p>Because we want to stay ahead in the new technologies we are investing \u00a32\u00bc billion over five years in British science, the largest investment since the 1960s.</p> <p>Because we know small businesses are a big part of the future, we are setting up venture capital funds in every region, tax breaks for investment, cuts in small business tax and the new Small Business Service to act as their advocate and protector in government.</p> <p>And because we know the danger that in a changing world new forms of inequality and social exclusion are created: the Sure Start programme - \u00a3500 million - to help children in poverty; a new Careers Service for school leavers; cutting homelessness and helping the homeless get jobs; a \u00a31 billion programme to renew deprived neighbourhoods; and extending the New Deal in the unemployment blackspots of Britain.</p> <p>I want to be the first prime minister in 40 years to stand up and say; Britain is back at full employment.</p> <p>But it all depends on having the strength to make the choice.</p> <p>Not by leaping aboard every passing bandwagon.</p> <p>There's Mr Hague.</p> <p>Standing around waiting for a bandwagon.</p> <p>Then three come along at once.</p> <p>There he was, week after week, glued to the box, to see who was voted out of Big Brother.</p> <p>And then announced it had always been Tory policy to throw them out.</p> <p>Opportunism always knocks for William Hague.</p> <p>You want tax cuts? Have them.</p> <p>Spending rises? Have them too.</p> <p>It all makes sense after 14 pints. Everything makes sense after 14 pints.</p> <p>John Redwood looks sane. Michael Portillo looks loyal.</p> <p>After 14 pints, even William Hague looks like a prime minister.</p> <p>The third big choice: a government with the strength to invest for the long term, or a government that cuts our public services.</p> <p>For 18 years, Britain suffered chronic under-investment in our public services. It held people back; it reduced opportunity. How could we reach a Britain where everyone can succeed, when, in May '97 half, literally half, of all 11-year-olds failed their basic tests?</p> <p>Or the NHS was on its knees.</p> <p>Or our transport system was the poor man of Europe?</p> <p>So to get to the next stage of our journey.</p> <p>Our education, health and transport plans represent the most radical reform in public services over ten years any government has produced since the War.</p> <p>So again, let me set out in detail the journey so far, and the plans for a second term.</p> <p>So far, 11,000 schools with new buildings.</p> <p>120,000 more free nursery places.</p> <p>As well as the best ever primary school tests, three hundred thousand fewer infants in classes of more than 30.</p> <p>300 more specialist secondary schools, improving their results at twice the average for other schools.</p> <p>A \u00a3200m reform programme to improve inner city comprehensives.</p> <p>A billion pound investment in our teachers to reward excellence in the classroom.</p> <p>But this is only the beginning. The next stage on the journey requires not only excellent primary schools but first-class secondary schools.</p> <p>By 2004, there will be one thousand specialist schools.</p> <p>An extra billion pound investment in ICT, to ensure one computer to every five children in our secondary schools.</p> <p>Catch-up tuition for all 11- and 12 year-olds who arrive without good literacy and numeracy.</p> <p>New targets for 14- and 16-year-olds.</p> <p>Better incentives for staying on at school, and an overhaul of further education to raise standards.</p> <p>New bursaries for student teachers of up to \u00a310,000, with already a 50% rise in graduate applications.</p> <p>And all these are policies that flow from our central belief that every single child deserves an equal chance. That every child is a unique asset to be brought to their fullest potential. It is why we are in this party. It is why education is the passion of this government.</p> <p>In our manifesto, line one of our contract with the people promised to increase the share of our national wealth spent on education during this Parliament.</p> <p>A promise made. A promise kept.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Guardian/labour2000/story/0,7369,373640,00.html\">Blair's speech, part two: 'We are in a fight and it's a fight I relish'</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "No prime minister, no party leader, could have a better deputy than John Prescott. You know why the Tories hate him: because he started out as a seaman, steward on a ship, rose to be deputy prime minister and has never hidden or been anything other than totally proud of where he came from. And you know why I like him: because not once in the last two weeks has he reminded me that when he was in charge in August we were 20 points ahead in the polls. I set out today the next steps of our journey to renew our country. Prosperity spreading to all parts of Britain. Secondary schools transformed. A modern NHS. A 21st century transport system. The yob culture tackled. On the way to ending child poverty. On the road to full employment. The people's priorities our priorities. That is a second term vision worth fighting for. Our destination: a Britain where, in a world of change, everyone not just a few gets the chance to succeed. For me, the large majority we won was never a reason to do the job quickly; but to do it properly. We knew: first base was getting the fundamentals in place. We said we would sort the economy out. We have. The strongest British economy for decades, delivered by this New Labour government. We said we'd get people off benefit and into work. We are. 1 million more jobs. We said we'd invest in schools and hospitals. It is happening. And because we chose to invest; because we have in this country tens of thousands of dedicated hard working teachers as determined as we are to give every child a chance to succeed, last week, Britain had the best primary school results it has ever seen. That is what I call: delivering on the fundamentals. And I could go on and give a list of all the other promises kept and change delivered. Over a million children out of poverty. This government leading the way on the environment at Kyoto. Devolution to the people of Scotland, Wales and London. Progress in Northern Ireland. Free eye tests for pensioners. Higher benefits for disabled children. 150,000 lone parents into work. Lowest business taxes. Record rises in child benefit. I could go on and on. Because we should be proud of our record. Not self-satisfied. Never complacent. But plain proud because the firm foundations we promised to lay are in place. But this is not a time for lists.

After the events of two weeks ago, it's no wonder the government has taken a knock. It happened on my watch and I take responsibility. So: what do we make of it? Three years ago, Britain was desperate to get the Tories out. The people liked the look of us. We were a breath of fresh air. New faces, new ideas, new policies. In some areas we've exceeded expectations. Let us be honest, a few people doubted the economy would be stronger under Labour. But it is. They like the 1m new jobs. They believe we are trying to make progress on schools and hospitals. But for many families life's still a struggle. It's tough, balancing work and family. Jobs can be insecure. There's the mortgage to pay; the holiday to save for. Inflation may be lower but the kid's trainers don't get any cheaper. Then, people hear the 20 second clip on the news. They see the ding-dong at prime minister's questions. They try to make sense of the swirling mass of news and comment in the 24-hour media age. And they think: you're not listening. What's it got to do with me? Where is this journey's end? And a fog descends on the very dialogue between Government and people necessary to get there. And, yes, there are things we have done that have made people angry and we should be open enough to admit it. The dome. Hindsight is a wonderful thing, and if I had my time again, I would have listened to those who said governments shouldn't try to run big visitor attractions. 75p. I tell you now, as Gordon made crystal clear yesterday, we get the message. But I believe that when people reflect, on the big fundamentals that determine our future - the economy, jobs, public services - we are doing the right thing, and we are on the right track for Britain; and the last thing this country needs is a return to Tory government. Let me come direct to the fuel crisis. I owe you an explanation. Yes, petrol is expensive. But of the 14p rise since the Budget last year, 12 pence has been in the world oil price. Which is why these protests have taken place all over the world. It's true that it's cheaper elsewhere in Europe. But VAT is often higher there. Income tax is higher. Business taxes are higher. There are road tolls and higher national insurance charges. All in all, Britain has the lowest overall tax burden of any large industrialised nation in the world except Japan and the USA. In the USA, you don't have the NHS. It's true that there will be extra revenues coming to government as a result of higher oil prices. But they nowhere near cover the protesters' demands. And there's something more. I am listening to people's anger over fuel duties. For hauliers and farmers to say nothing of ordinary motorists, there is real hardship. But I have also had to listen over under-funding in the NHS. Over extra investment in schools. Over more police on the beat. Over public transport. I am listening over mortgages, where low interest rates can only be maintained if disciplined public finances are kept. I am also listening to pensioners who believe the government should give them a greater share of the country's prosperity. Our first priority was to help the 2 million pensioners, many of them elderly women, who depend on income support. I make no apology for helping the poorest first and neither should this Party. Through the winter allowance, now \u00a3150, and free TV licences for over 75s, we helped people with their most pressing costs. We rejected returning to the earnings link.

It is right they share in the nation's wealth. I am listening. I hear. And I will act. The point I'm making is this. The real world is full of competing causes. Most of them good. Most of them deserving. Many of them heart-rending. And it's not an arrogant government that chooses priorities. It's an irresponsible government that fails to choose. The test of leadership in politics is not how eloquently you say yes. It's how you explain why you're saying no. To be in touch is to be in sympathy. To be in government is to decide. And would it ever be right to choose a priority simply on the basis of a fuel blockade? What of those who can't protest; whose voice isn't supported by the media; who go neglected unless we speak for them? So I am listening. But I was also elected to lead. And if we want to reach our journey's end - that strong, fair and prosperous Britain for all - there are choices to be made. There are forks in the road, where which way we take determines the future lives of millions of people. They are decisions of destiny and I would like to explain them. The first big choice: a government with the strength to deliver stability, or a government that takes the country back to boom and bust. Without economic strength, there will never be a Britain where everyone can succeed. Remember the late 80s/early 90s, interest rates at 10% for four years, 15% for a year.

A women wrote to me recently and said that, for the first time in her life, thanks to the Working Families' Tax Credit, she could afford a holiday and thanks to the Social Chapter, she was entitled to one. And at long last a national statutory minimum wage has given 1\u00bd million people the dignity of a decent living wage.

To give everyone the chance to succeed, right in the heartlands of middle Britain, there are families and businesses that will need that helping hand. And because of the scale of what we are doing, and the scale of our ambition, let me set out in detail what we are doing, and what we will do in the future. Because 90% of new jobs will need skills with computers, there will be 6000 centres round Britain, giving access to the internet and help with technology. Everyone will get an 80% discount on computer courses, the unemployed will get it for free. There will be 1000 more technology centres for small businesses or the self-employed. Because we want to stay ahead in the new technologies we are investing \u00a32\u00bc billion over five years in British science, the largest investment since the 1960s. Because we know small businesses are a big part of the future, we are setting up venture capital funds in every region, tax breaks for investment, cuts in small business tax and the new Small Business Service to act as their advocate and protector in government. And because we know the danger that in a changing world new forms of inequality and social exclusion are created: the Sure Start programme - \u00a3500 million - to help children in poverty; a new Careers Service for school leavers; cutting homelessness and helping the homeless get jobs; a \u00a31 billion programme to renew deprived neighbourhoods; and extending the New Deal in the unemployment blackspots of Britain. I want to be the first prime minister in 40 years to stand up and say; Britain is back at full employment. But it all depends on having the strength to make the choice. Not by leaping aboard every passing bandwagon. There's Mr Hague. Standing around waiting for a bandwagon. Then three come along at once. There he was, week after week, glued to the box, to see who was voted out of Big Brother. And then announced it had always been Tory policy to throw them out. Opportunism always knocks for William Hague. You want tax cuts? Have them. Spending rises? Have them too. It all makes sense after 14 pints. Everything makes sense after 14 pints. John Redwood looks sane. Michael Portillo looks loyal. After 14 pints, even William Hague looks like a prime minister. The third big choice: a government with the strength to invest for the long term, or a government that cuts our public services. For 18 years, Britain suffered chronic under-investment in our public services. It held people back; it reduced opportunity. How could we reach a Britain where everyone can succeed, when, in May '97 half, literally half, of all 11-year-olds failed their basic tests? Or the NHS was on its knees. Or our transport system was the poor man of Europe? So to get to the next stage of our journey. Our education, health and transport plans represent the most radical reform in public services over ten years any government has produced since the War. So again, let me set out in detail the journey so far, and the plans for a second term. So far, 11,000 schools with new buildings. 120,000 more free nursery places. As well as the best ever primary school tests, three hundred thousand fewer infants in classes of more than 30. 300 more specialist secondary schools, improving their results at twice the average for other schools. A \u00a3200m reform programme to improve inner city comprehensives. A billion pound investment in our teachers to reward excellence in the classroom. But this is only the beginning. The next stage on the journey requires not only excellent primary schools but first-class secondary schools. By 2004, there will be one thousand specialist schools. An extra billion pound investment in ICT, to ensure one computer to every five children in our secondary schools. Catch-up tuition for all 11- and 12 year-olds who arrive without good literacy and numeracy. New targets for 14- and 16-year-olds. Better incentives for staying on at school, and an overhaul of further education to raise standards. New bursaries for student teachers of up to \u00a310,000, with already a 50% rise in graduate applications. And all these are policies that flow from our central belief that every single child deserves an equal chance. That every child is a unique asset to be brought to their fullest potential. It is why we are in this party. It is why education is the passion of this government. In our manifesto, line one of our contract with the people promised to increase the share of our national wealth spent on education during this Parliament. A promise made. A promise kept. Blair's speech, part two: 'We are in a fight and it's a fight I relish'",

      "body": "<p>Elizabethan clergy anxiously reporting to the bishop on the state of their parishioners' souls can hardly have imagined they were creating a goldmine for future scholars in a digital age. \"Ecclesiastical records may seem rather dry, but they contain an enormous amount about crime and marriage and gender relations,\" comments Allen Warren, head of York University's history department. </p> <p>Fears of witchcraft and political upheaval, traces of poverty and disease, the views of ordinary people who did not write but who reveal all sorts of views and assumptions of the time in their wills - the sort of archive built up over centuries by the archdiocese of York is now a magnet for university researchers. </p> <p>But it is not in a university library. Housed in a picturesque building in the medieval city centre, the Borthwick Institute archive is outgrowing its home and York University is keen to take it under its wing, rehouse it and make it more accessible to scholars as part of an ambitious \u00a37.5m development. </p> <p>Far from superseding traditional archives, new digital technology has the potential to bring more of them to light and make them more accessible. </p> <p>The York project is taking place against the background of a revolution in British research libraries. It's a quiet revolution - but the vision that archives and books scattered in different libraries should be seen as a parts of a whole has been gaining ground over the past five years. For researchers it does not matter if the document or book they want to consult is in York, London or Edinburgh, just as long as they can locate it. So a lot of effort is going into cataloguing collections - and inventing bizarre names for them - to create what librarians call a Distributed National Resource. </p> <p>Logically, this would produce a single integrated \"library\" covering the country - but that was \"overambitious\", according to Ronald Milne, director of the Research Support Libraries Programme, which is spending \u00a330m over three years to link university libraries with each other and with public libraries and collections. However, building a distributed national resource in particular disciplines like archaeology or Chinese is, he believes, achievable. </p> <p>In one sense York is a good example of the new spirit of collaboration. The project is linking the university not only with the Borthwick collection but the National Railway Museum archive in the city and privately held collections in the region. But the York scheme also reveals a tension between national plans and local ambition. The planned \u00a33m humanities research library for the university campus will, it is hoped, put York more firmly on the research map.

      "bodyText": "Elizabethan clergy anxiously reporting to the bishop on the state of their parishioners' souls can hardly have imagined they were creating a goldmine for future scholars in a digital age. \"Ecclesiastical records may seem rather dry, but they contain an enormous amount about crime and marriage and gender relations,\" comments Allen Warren, head of York University's history department. Fears of witchcraft and political upheaval, traces of poverty and disease, the views of ordinary people who did not write but who reveal all sorts of views and assumptions of the time in their wills - the sort of archive built up over centuries by the archdiocese of York is now a magnet for university researchers. But it is not in a university library. Housed in a picturesque building in the medieval city centre, the Borthwick Institute archive is outgrowing its home and York University is keen to take it under its wing, rehouse it and make it more accessible to scholars as part of an ambitious \u00a37.5m development. Far from superseding traditional archives, new digital technology has the potential to bring more of them to light and make them more accessible. The York project is taking place against the background of a revolution in British research libraries. It's a quiet revolution - but the vision that archives and books scattered in different libraries should be seen as a parts of a whole has been gaining ground over the past five years. For researchers it does not matter if the document or book they want to consult is in York, London or Edinburgh, just as long as they can locate it. So a lot of effort is going into cataloguing collections - and inventing bizarre names for them - to create what librarians call a Distributed National Resource. Logically, this would produce a single integrated \"library\" covering the country - but that was \"overambitious\", according to Ronald Milne, director of the Research Support Libraries Programme, which is spending \u00a330m over three years to link university libraries with each other and with public libraries and collections. However, building a distributed national resource in particular disciplines like archaeology or Chinese is, he believes, achievable. In one sense York is a good example of the new spirit of collaboration. The project is linking the university not only with the Borthwick collection but the National Railway Museum archive in the city and privately held collections in the region. But the York scheme also reveals a tension between national plans and local ambition. The planned \u00a33m humanities research library for the university campus will, it is hoped, put York more firmly on the research map.

      "byline": "Anita Chaudhuri",

      "body": "<p>The internet has done many things to elevate women's lives to the realms of fantasy; electronic flirting allows us to tell huge fibs without the slightest risk of heartbreak (\"Yes, people often mistake me for Xena Warrior Princess, honest\") and when love goes wrong we can seek round-the-clock comfort from <a href=\"http://www.breakupgirl.com\" target=\"_NEW\">BreakUp Girl</a>, the postfeminist boyfriend advice site. Now, though, women's wildest fantasies are being catered for in an entirely different way, with the booming online literary phenomenon, slash fiction. </p> <p>The term refers to the use of a stroke or \"slash\" to signify a homoerotic relationship between two characters from a cult TV show or film. It could be any two personalities such as the hugely popular Star Trek pairing Kirk/Spock or Mulder/Krycek from The X-Files. The only restriction is that the characters should not have a sexual relationship in the \"real\" series. </p> <p>On the face of it, this looks like just another geeky outpouring from the net's lunatic fringe. Certainly there is no obvious connection between this level of fan writing and women's erotic empowerment. Yet surf through a few typical sites and something unexpected emerges: almost all the stories are written by heterosexual women. Some offer truly bizarre pairings - Joey and Chandler from Friends, Ashley and Nicky Platt from Coronation Street, bluff TV detectives Dalziel and Pascoe. The story content ranges from the sadistic (Mulder tying Krycek in knots) to the sensitive, with macho characters showing a level of vulnerability never allowed on screen. </p> <p>It is no coincidence that the vast majority of character pairings come from shows with a tough guy element. If there's a common thread running through much of slash fiction, it's that women appear to find erotic appeal in emasculating TV hard men. Take the following example, from the LadySlash web-ring, which features slash coupling Starsky and Hutch: </p> <p> \"Is it worth risking our partnership? Our friendship?\" asked Starsky. </p> <p>\"Yes,\" said Hutch. </p> <p>\"Hutch, don't. Don't cry. Please.\" </p> <p>He felt a gentle hand brush at his cheek. \"If this is a mistake...\" </p> <p>\"It's not. Trust me.\" </p> <p>\"I don't want to lose you...\" </p> <p>\"You're not gonna lose me. Close your eyes. Go on, close your eyes.\" </p> <p>Something that felt like velvet brushed his ear. He shivered again, this time with raw emotion rather than chill. The velvet teaser moved slowly down his jaw, to nuzzle briefly at his neck before moving on... No woman had ever played with his nipples. Starsky was doing that. Licking them, covering them with little kisses until they hardened into tiny buds. If he's never done this before, how the hell can he do it so well? </p> <p>This question seems a reasonable one to put to an author of the genre. Where on earth does the inspiration come from? Kitty Fisher, who works for the school library service by day, has been writing slash for eight years; her stories have appeared on the internet and in the Black Lace collection Wicked Words. \"In a way it is easier for female writers to use male-on-male characters when writing about sex, particularly the type of sex that appears in slash fiction. There's a leaning to dark stories, non-consensual sex, dominance. By writing about men, you're distancing yourself.\" </p> <p>So it's a guilt thing? \"Well, we may have crossed the century but we are still tied to Victorian morality, even if we don't want to be. It's not acceptable for women to say they get turned on by sex and violence. But it's not just about that - there's an emphasis on humour and emotion which is lacking in a lot of mainstream erotic writing.\" </p> <p>Fisher first stumbled upon slash in the pre-internet days when it existed only in obscure Star Trek fanzines. \"I loved the use of characters I already knew, the subversion, the dark side to it. A reader knows the backstory; there are so many things actors do unconsciously on screen which fans can pick up on and twist to their own ends.\" She points out that for many writers, the appeal of slash is escapism. Many friends she has made on the scene work for the government, in management consultancy or teaching. </p> <p>Elanor Summerton, who runs the <a href=\"http://www.britslash.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">Britslash</a> website, says: \"Analysing why I like slash is tricky.

      "bodyText": "The internet has done many things to elevate women's lives to the realms of fantasy; electronic flirting allows us to tell huge fibs without the slightest risk of heartbreak (\"Yes, people often mistake me for Xena Warrior Princess, honest\") and when love goes wrong we can seek round-the-clock comfort from BreakUp Girl, the postfeminist boyfriend advice site. Now, though, women's wildest fantasies are being catered for in an entirely different way, with the booming online literary phenomenon, slash fiction. The term refers to the use of a stroke or \"slash\" to signify a homoerotic relationship between two characters from a cult TV show or film. It could be any two personalities such as the hugely popular Star Trek pairing Kirk/Spock or Mulder/Krycek from The X-Files. The only restriction is that the characters should not have a sexual relationship in the \"real\" series. On the face of it, this looks like just another geeky outpouring from the net's lunatic fringe. Certainly there is no obvious connection between this level of fan writing and women's erotic empowerment. Yet surf through a few typical sites and something unexpected emerges: almost all the stories are written by heterosexual women. Some offer truly bizarre pairings - Joey and Chandler from Friends, Ashley and Nicky Platt from Coronation Street, bluff TV detectives Dalziel and Pascoe. The story content ranges from the sadistic (Mulder tying Krycek in knots) to the sensitive, with macho characters showing a level of vulnerability never allowed on screen. It is no coincidence that the vast majority of character pairings come from shows with a tough guy element. If there's a common thread running through much of slash fiction, it's that women appear to find erotic appeal in emasculating TV hard men. Take the following example, from the LadySlash web-ring, which features slash coupling Starsky and Hutch: \"Is it worth risking our partnership? Our friendship?\" asked Starsky. \"Yes,\" said Hutch. \"Hutch, don't. Don't cry. Please.\" He felt a gentle hand brush at his cheek. \"If this is a mistake...\" \"It's not. Trust me.\" \"I don't want to lose you...\" \"You're not gonna lose me. Close your eyes. Go on, close your eyes.\" Something that felt like velvet brushed his ear. He shivered again, this time with raw emotion rather than chill. The velvet teaser moved slowly down his jaw, to nuzzle briefly at his neck before moving on... No woman had ever played with his nipples. Starsky was doing that. Licking them, covering them with little kisses until they hardened into tiny buds. If he's never done this before, how the hell can he do it so well? This question seems a reasonable one to put to an author of the genre. Where on earth does the inspiration come from? Kitty Fisher, who works for the school library service by day, has been writing slash for eight years; her stories have appeared on the internet and in the Black Lace collection Wicked Words. \"In a way it is easier for female writers to use male-on-male characters when writing about sex, particularly the type of sex that appears in slash fiction. There's a leaning to dark stories, non-consensual sex, dominance. By writing about men, you're distancing yourself.\" So it's a guilt thing? \"Well, we may have crossed the century but we are still tied to Victorian morality, even if we don't want to be. It's not acceptable for women to say they get turned on by sex and violence. But it's not just about that - there's an emphasis on humour and emotion which is lacking in a lot of mainstream erotic writing.\" Fisher first stumbled upon slash in the pre-internet days when it existed only in obscure Star Trek fanzines. \"I loved the use of characters I already knew, the subversion, the dark side to it. A reader knows the backstory; there are so many things actors do unconsciously on screen which fans can pick up on and twist to their own ends.\" She points out that for many writers, the appeal of slash is escapism. Many friends she has made on the scene work for the government, in management consultancy or teaching. Elanor Summerton, who runs the Britslash website, says: \"Analysing why I like slash is tricky. I've always assumed that if men like watching women together, women might enjoy the reverse. Women seem to prefer written erotica, with well-developed characters and more emotion. In fact, some of the best slash I've read has few sex scenes and is not explicit.\" Another reason why many women are turning to the format is that the slash community encourages new writers. \"It's very welcoming and supportive,\" explains R Olivia Brown who runs the RedRoses fanzine. \"Discussion between writers abounds and it's not restricted by what's acceptable outside in the 'real' world.

He later defected to the United States and worked as a double agent.</p> <p>Mr Giaka said: \"I was active in the student union and in the revolutionary committees and through my contacts within it I was able to join the JSO [the Libyan security service]. The aim of these revolutionary committees is to put down any dissidence in Libya.\"</p> <p>He was flown in from the US where he lives under a new identity as part of the federal witness protection programme.</p> <p>Mr Giaka, 40, was escorted to the special Scottish court at Camp Zeist in the Netherlands by 30 US marshals. Screens were raised in the courtroom to hide his face, and live television pictures of the court proceedings - which are beamed to Lockerbie, London, New York and Washington DC - were obscured.

      "bodyText": "A former Libyan spy today gave evidence to the Lockerbie trial describing his career in the country's intelligence service. The trial of two Libyans accused of blowing up Pan Am Flight 103 heard how Abdul Majid Giaka was recruited after graduating from university. He later defected to the United States and worked as a double agent. Mr Giaka said: \"I was active in the student union and in the revolutionary committees and through my contacts within it I was able to join the JSO [the Libyan security service]. The aim of these revolutionary committees is to put down any dissidence in Libya.\" He was flown in from the US where he lives under a new identity as part of the federal witness protection programme. Mr Giaka, 40, was escorted to the special Scottish court at Camp Zeist in the Netherlands by 30 US marshals. Screens were raised in the courtroom to hide his face, and live television pictures of the court proceedings - which are beamed to Lockerbie, London, New York and Washington DC - were obscured. His voice was also electronically distorted on the courtroom translation system. Security at the court has been noticeably strengthened this week reflecting concern that Libyan agents have been plotting to assassinate Mr Giaka ever since his defection to the US. Mr Giaka told prosecutor Alastair Campbell QC that he started working for the Libyan security service in 1984 and in 1986 he moved to become assistant station manager in Malta. This posting, based at the island's airport, was part of the intelligence service's airline security section, to protect aircraft, passengers and crew of Libyan Arab Airlines. The two defendants also worked at Luga airport, Malta, for the Libyan airline and were also alleged members of the Libyan security service. Mr Giaka said that when he arrived in Malta, Mr Al Megrahi was head of the airline security section. Mr Al Megrahi, 48, and Mr Fhimah, 44, are said to have caused a suitcase containing a Toshiba \"Bombeat\" radio-cassette player packed with Semtex to be placed on the Frankfurt-bound 747 from Luga airport. The Pan Am flight exploded above Scotland on December 21, 1988, killing all 259 passengers and crew and 11 residents on the ground. Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi and Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah deny conspiracy to murder, murder and a breach of the 1982 Aviation Security Act.",

Tony Blair is under pressure to use his keynote speech to the Labour party conference to offer concessions on the contentious issues of pensions and fuel. But he is expected to offer no quick fixes - and to promise delegates in Brighton a fightback to defeat the Tories at the next election. The prime minister was expected to mirror comments from the Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, that the cabinet could have seemed too high-handed and bureaucratic in its response to recent events. It will be the clearest admission by Mr Blair of the way his party has come to be seen by voters as arrogant and out of touch. Mr Blair will attempt to turn the Tories' opinion poll success - that has seen them rush into an 8% lead - to his advantage, warning delegates there was now a real fight on for the future of Britain. Labour sources say the prime minister insists it is a fight he welcomes, and one he regards as over the future of investment in public services such as schools and hospitals. Mr Blair faces pressure to address the issues of pensions and fuel in his speech - but he is not expected to offer any quick fixes. He is expected to echo yesterday's message of the chancellor, Gordon Brown, that ministers are delivering on the issues that really matter and will heed publicly expressed concerns during the Budget process.

      "bodyText": "Oil prices struggled to remain above $30 a barrel yesterday as the European Union hinted that it was prepared to follow the lead of the United States in releasing crude from its strategic reserve With EU finance ministers to discuss on Friday the possible use of their reserves, oil prices fell below $30 a barrel at one stage in London yesterday as dealers anticipated action by rich western countries and the Opec oil cartel to increase the supply of fuel. G7 officials in Prague on the eve of the World Bank/IMF summit said they were happy with the reaction of the commodities markets, which left some analysts predicting a price of $25 a barrel before the end of the year. The fall in oil was in contrast to the cautious mood in the foreign exchange markets, where the euro drifted slightly lower once it became clear that the G7 industrial countries were not going to repeat Friday's intervention. Fears that the Danish referendum on Thursday might lead to renewed downward pressure on the single currency pushed the rate against the dollar back to where it was sitting before central banks and finance ministries spent around $7bn in their surprise move last week. In the absence of new action by the G7 yesterday, it was left to Jean-Claude Trichet, the governor of the Bank of France, to prevent the euro falling against the dollar to below 87 cents, when he said that the decline had gone too far. The euro closed at $0.872 in London after starting the day half a cent higher, but was still well above its record low of just under $0.845 last week. James Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank, yesterday became the latest global leader to warn of the dangers of high oil prices. He said poor countries were facing a double blow of higher energy costs and lower commodity prices, particularly for cocoa and coffee. The west's leading think-tank, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, said yesterday that oil prices of $30 a barrel this year and $33 a barrel next would shave 0.4 of a percentage point off global growth. In the markets yesterday, Brent crude futures followed Friday's $1.50 fall by dropping a further $1.35 to $29.90 in morning trading. Oil futures were also lower in New York, where the decision by the Clinton administration to draw down the reserve, coupled with hopes that G7 pressure will lead to further supply increases from Opec, offset fears that a tough winter would leave the US short of fuel. The release from the US strategic petroleum reserve was announced by the energy secretary, Bill Richardson, after the markets closed on Friday, but prices had already fallen from 10-year peaks, $34.98 on Brent and $37.80 on American Nymex crude, over the week as markets anticipated the initiative. Some traders said the impact of the release, the first since the 1990-1991 Gulf crisis, could be increased because it would coincide with the Opec producers' latest output increase of 800,000 barrels a day, which will start reaching the markets on October 1. Under the release, oil from the reserve would effectively be lent to oil companies, which would replace it at a later date. The European commission spokesman Gilles Gantelet said that discussions were under way among EU partners about the possible use of strategic oil reserves to combat high prices. He said, however, that \"for the moment, there is no intention at a European level to use the reserves\".",

      "bodyText": "La campa\u00f1a de las elecciones presidenciales en Estados Unidos tiene acento latino. El candidato republicano George W. Bush habla en castellano para pedir el voto hispano. El candidato dem\u00f3crata, Al Gore, visita las comunidades latinas para acceder a la Casa Blanca. La minor\u00eda hispana en Estados Unidos tiene en sus manos un gran poder de decisi\u00f3n. Son treinta millones de ciudadanos y representan el diez por ciento de la poblaci\u00f3n. Est\u00e1n concentrados en estados clave: California, Texas, Nueva York y Florida. Es imposible ganar las elecciones presidenciales sin ganar en California. Y es imposible ganar en California sin conseguir, al menos, un tercio del voto latino. El voto de la minor\u00eda hispana en Estados Unidos puede decidir entre 25 y 30 esca\u00f1os de la C\u00e1mara de Representantes. Cree usted que la comunidad hispana en Estados Unidos tiene cada vez m\u00e1s influencia? Mar\u00eda Mart\u00ednez (17 a\u00f1os): S\u00ed, porque en cinco a\u00f1os ser\u00e1 la mayor\u00eda entre las minor\u00edas. Y su crecimiento demogr\u00e1fico es muy acele- rado. La gente reivindica ahora sus ra\u00edces hispanas. Donde yo vivo, en Washington Heights, casi todos son dominicanos, puertorrique\u00f1os y cubanos. En la calle, en los bancos, \"las aplicaciones\" oficiales est\u00e1n todas en espa\u00f1ol y en ingl\u00e9s. En las cuadras cuelgan sus banderas de sus pa\u00edses y las fiestas que organizan son muy populares. Robert Stevens (18 a\u00f1os): S\u00ed, es como una moda, y quiz\u00e1 un poco exagerado. Dicen que en Nueva York uno de cada cinco ciudadanos habla espa\u00f1ol en casa. Hay cadenas de televisi\u00f3n y radio en espa\u00f1ol, y tienen mucha audiencia. Ingrid Mat\u00edas (19 a\u00f1os): S\u00ed, es cada vez m\u00e1s influyente. Los artistas latinos ayudan a dar a conocer que existe una comunidad latina y que est\u00e1 aqu\u00ed para quedarse.

Grouping them under such headings as Rescuers, Rebels, Battlers and Ferals, this is no literary classic but it merits wide exposure.

To throw that away is to throw away something which really opens gates for young people, irrespective of whether they go to university or into some other professional training. </p> <p>He is 17 - so another year is nothing within the context of living until he is 70. It is clearly shown in research that by the time they reach 28, people with a degree are well ahead of their peer group in both pay and job satisfaction. This is a lot to throw away for what is essentially eight months -a very short-term gain. Stick with it. </p> <p><strong> Ingrid Sutherland, Advisory Centre for Education, says:</strong> </p> <p>Generally 16-year-olds will vote with their feet, and it is difficult to force them to do anything they don't want to do. I suggest you investigate if there are any underlying causes for his disaffection. Obviously there is the influence of his friends, but there could be other reasons. A-levels require a lot of independent work; perhaps he is panicking about the transition into a different way of studying. There might be a hidden cause - a relationship problem or a clash with a teacher. </p> <p>In terms of parental action, it is difficult with teenagers.

      "bodyText": "Dr Kevin Conway, Greenhead College, Huddersfield, says: I would sit down and say to someone in that position, \"Look, you have two and a half terms to go, which is no length of time, and you would be throwing away the first whole year of work.\" The total national percentage of people who end up at 18 with three A-levels - even just at grade E, never mind anything else - is only 25-30%. To throw that away is to throw away something which really opens gates for young people, irrespective of whether they go to university or into some other professional training. He is 17 - so another year is nothing within the context of living until he is 70. It is clearly shown in research that by the time they reach 28, people with a degree are well ahead of their peer group in both pay and job satisfaction. This is a lot to throw away for what is essentially eight months -a very short-term gain. Stick with it. Ingrid Sutherland, Advisory Centre for Education, says: Generally 16-year-olds will vote with their feet, and it is difficult to force them to do anything they don't want to do. I suggest you investigate if there are any underlying causes for his disaffection. Obviously there is the influence of his friends, but there could be other reasons. A-levels require a lot of independent work; perhaps he is panicking about the transition into a different way of studying. There might be a hidden cause - a relationship problem or a clash with a teacher. In terms of parental action, it is difficult with teenagers. They could suggest that he speaks to his course co-ordinator or a careers adviser, or even a teacher he gets on well with. I would not suggest speaking directly to the school without their son's permission, but they could perhaps have a meeting including their son, about how they could all work together to help.

      "body": "<p>This year sees a number of academic business schools developing e-business programmes, signalling that e-commerce has already established itself as a central component of postgraduate business degrees. The new breed of Masters of Business Administration students are just as likely to be taught the latest thinking on e-strategies, e-marketing and e-technology as the more traditional business and project management skills during their courses. </p> <p>The rise of the dot.com entrepreneur initially appeared to pose a threat to MBAs. Here were businesses apparently defying all the laws of the financial markets, expanding on the back of one big idea, amid limitless hype and investor confidence. Who needed a two-year business degree when you could move immediately into the fast stream and become a paper millionaire overnight? </p> <p>There have even been concerns that increasing numbers of business students would begin baling out of MBA courses as the new-economy companies sought out managers. But as yet there is no hard evidence that this has happened - either in Europe or North America. So far, there is no evidence to suggest that the new economy is leading MBA students into temptation. Dropout rates reported from UK schools are low. </p> <p>Business school leaders in fact argue that MBA programmes are becoming more important for new businesses in short supply of executive talent. The humbling of the dot.com business world has seen many old business values reasserted among internet companies. The talk now is of merging old and new economy, with the best long-term strategies based on good ideas but also on sound business planning. And MBAs are now adapting to the new blend of skills being demanded. </p> <p>Last year an MBA student from London Business School won the Association of Business Schools Award for the creation of the world's biggest ski destination website, iglu.com. </p> <p>Jonathan Slack, the chief executive of the ABS, says: \"There are going to be exceptions to every rule, but most successful entrepreneurs benefit from business training.\" He says that business schools offer a range of e-commerce programmes, some short, tightly focused courses, others broader modules. Continuous efforts are made to keep things up to date. </p> <p>One of Europe's first MBA programmes specialising in electronic business has been created by City University Business School. The course is not aimed specifically at technology experts, but aimed at anyone needing to understand and exploit the new information technologies. It includes modules on electronic business, new media in marketing and two courses on e-commerce. City's is one of the business schools in the UK designated by the government as an IT centre for excellence. </p> <p>Recent successful MBA projects in e-commerce have included students sponsored in parallel by Sun Microsystems and Abbey National. </p> <p>A new MA in marketing with electronic commerce, meanwhile, has been launched at the University of Portsmouth Business School. One of the first programmes of its kind in the UK, the course seeks to combine two subject areas that have grown significantly in recent years and are expected to develop dramatically in the coming years. It is aimed at marketing personnel who want to develop an understanding of the key technical capabilities of e-commerce and formalise their marketing qualifications. </p> <p>Web-based marketing is also growing in popularity at the Manchester Business School. A team of graduates recently developed strategic ideas for web-based marketing company Top Jobs on the net. The company has now become a leading internet job supplier. </p> <p>Leeds University has teamed up with the world's third largest software company to create a new MBA in information management. And the London Business School has launched a series of e-business programmes, focusing on e-strategies, e-service, e-marketing and e-technology. The launch of the internet service, e-business@london.edu, is designed to help organisations understand the challenges of the new economy. </p> <p>\"E-commerce is currently the only identifiable sector of the world economy experiencing exponential growth of over 100% per year,\" says the association's latest bulletin. \"UK business schools are leading the development of a wide range of relevant research and programme development to enable students and practising managers to update their knowledge and skills and strategies in the vitally important area of e-commerce.\"</p>",

Who needed a two-year business degree when you could move immediately into the fast stream and become a paper millionaire overnight? There have even been concerns that increasing numbers of business students would begin baling out of MBA courses as the new-economy companies sought out managers. But as yet there is no hard evidence that this has happened - either in Europe or North America. So far, there is no evidence to suggest that the new economy is leading MBA students into temptation. Dropout rates reported from UK schools are low. Business school leaders in fact argue that MBA programmes are becoming more important for new businesses in short supply of executive talent. The humbling of the dot.com business world has seen many old business values reasserted among internet companies. The talk now is of merging old and new economy, with the best long-term strategies based on good ideas but also on sound business planning. And MBAs are now adapting to the new blend of skills being demanded. Last year an MBA student from London Business School won the Association of Business Schools Award for the creation of the world's biggest ski destination website, iglu.com. Jonathan Slack, the chief executive of the ABS, says: \"There are going to be exceptions to every rule, but most successful entrepreneurs benefit from business training.\" He says that business schools offer a range of e-commerce programmes, some short, tightly focused courses, others broader modules. Continuous efforts are made to keep things up to date. One of Europe's first MBA programmes specialising in electronic business has been created by City University Business School. The course is not aimed specifically at technology experts, but aimed at anyone needing to understand and exploit the new information technologies. It includes modules on electronic business, new media in marketing and two courses on e-commerce. City's is one of the business schools in the UK designated by the government as an IT centre for excellence. Recent successful MBA projects in e-commerce have included students sponsored in parallel by Sun Microsystems and Abbey National. A new MA in marketing with electronic commerce, meanwhile, has been launched at the University of Portsmouth Business School. One of the first programmes of its kind in the UK, the course seeks to combine two subject areas that have grown significantly in recent years and are expected to develop dramatically in the coming years. It is aimed at marketing personnel who want to develop an understanding of the key technical capabilities of e-commerce and formalise their marketing qualifications. Web-based marketing is also growing in popularity at the Manchester Business School. A team of graduates recently developed strategic ideas for web-based marketing company Top Jobs on the net. The company has now become a leading internet job supplier. Leeds University has teamed up with the world's third largest software company to create a new MBA in information management. And the London Business School has launched a series of e-business programmes, focusing on e-strategies, e-service, e-marketing and e-technology. The launch of the internet service, e-business@london.edu, is designed to help organisations understand the challenges of the new economy. \"E-commerce is currently the only identifiable sector of the world economy experiencing exponential growth of over 100% per year,\" says the association's latest bulletin. \"UK business schools are leading the development of a wide range of relevant research and programme development to enable students and practising managers to update their knowledge and skills and strategies in the vitally important area of e-commerce.\"",

The downside is that there have been some hiccups in the system's early development and not all schools, colleges or careers centres can use it yet. Ucas insist problems with their system not running on RM computers have now been eliminated and it will work on any PC, though not on Macs. You cannot apply direct to Ucas using EAS. You must apply through your school, college or careers centre. There they will check the form, attach the reference and send it to Ucas. Ucas intend to launch an internet version in 2002.",

      "body": "<p>Baked beans manufacturers Heinz used to boast that they had 57 varieties of products on their shelves. The government cannot claim the same for the 47 learning and skills councils, having just announced the appointments of all bar two of the top jobs to run the new outfits. </p> <p>That's possibly because so many of the executive directors, who will earn \u00a352-58,000, have been taken from the same, some would argue, sullied stables that have faced consistent criticism. </p> <p>These are the officially discredited Training and Enterprise Councils, who have passed their sell-by date, alongside the local education authorities, which, we are constantly told, never do things right. </p> <p>Let's not forget that the dramatic under-performance of the TECs was responsible for triggering a ministerial review 18 months ago. This eventually led to a bill, and later an Act that, with a flurry of consultative documents, led to wholesale reform of the organisation and funding of the post-16 sector. </p> <p>Apart from a handful of further education college principals and a career civil servant, the majority of the new learning and skills council bosses have been taken from the same familiar cans. </p> <p>Naturally Baroness Blackstone, the education and employment minister who sanctioned the appointments, says she is confident that the people, selected \"from a high quality field\" of applicants, will bring a \"business-like approach\" to the work of the councils. </p> <p>But she and her DfEE officials - anxious to propel further education away from its immutable Cinderella tag - appear to have gone shopping at the local corner shop for their wares, disregarding the possibility of getting a greater choice of talented candidates by looking further afield. Why, for instance, do the legions of senior bureaucrats, currently counting down their days at the Further Education Funding Council - another animal due for extinction - appear to have been ignored? </p> <p>Then there are the inevitable claims of patronage, of New Labour cronies, of late-night calls and the incredible fencing in the dark. </p> <p>One newly appointed executive director commented: \"It was very late in the evening when the phone rang.

      "bodyText": "Baked beans manufacturers Heinz used to boast that they had 57 varieties of products on their shelves. The government cannot claim the same for the 47 learning and skills councils, having just announced the appointments of all bar two of the top jobs to run the new outfits. That's possibly because so many of the executive directors, who will earn \u00a352-58,000, have been taken from the same, some would argue, sullied stables that have faced consistent criticism. These are the officially discredited Training and Enterprise Councils, who have passed their sell-by date, alongside the local education authorities, which, we are constantly told, never do things right. Let's not forget that the dramatic under-performance of the TECs was responsible for triggering a ministerial review 18 months ago. This eventually led to a bill, and later an Act that, with a flurry of consultative documents, led to wholesale reform of the organisation and funding of the post-16 sector. Apart from a handful of further education college principals and a career civil servant, the majority of the new learning and skills council bosses have been taken from the same familiar cans. Naturally Baroness Blackstone, the education and employment minister who sanctioned the appointments, says she is confident that the people, selected \"from a high quality field\" of applicants, will bring a \"business-like approach\" to the work of the councils. But she and her DfEE officials - anxious to propel further education away from its immutable Cinderella tag - appear to have gone shopping at the local corner shop for their wares, disregarding the possibility of getting a greater choice of talented candidates by looking further afield. Why, for instance, do the legions of senior bureaucrats, currently counting down their days at the Further Education Funding Council - another animal due for extinction - appear to have been ignored? Then there are the inevitable claims of patronage, of New Labour cronies, of late-night calls and the incredible fencing in the dark. One newly appointed executive director commented: \"It was very late in the evening when the phone rang. I was otherwise engaged, shall we say. But blow sex and all that, I answered the call, and the conversation went pretty well. This new job could be the climax of my professional life. \"It will be far easier to try to implement government policy than to run an institution constantly under attack from criticism and cynicism.\" Another recalls his interview, when he suddenly realised he shared with his interrogators a mutual ignorance about what was wanted.

Befrienders International, the UK-based umbrella group for the Samaritan movement, is using the two countries as a starting point for a new life-skills programme in suicide- prevention. Reaching Young Europe starts its second stage next month and will look at how children as young as six should cope with bereavement, bullying, disappointment and loneliness. </p> <p>For years, well-meaning educational organisations have espoused the benefits of starting young. We encourage children to talk, walk and read as soon as they demonstrate the capabilities to do so. But there is something faintly disturbing - or at the very least saddening - about starting suicide prevention at such a young age. Suicide remains a taboo topic in young classrooms. To some, the idea of breaking that silence equates to calling time on an age of innocence. </p> <p>Befrienders, of course, is not so pessimistic. Chris Bale, director of the organisation, is keen to point out that theirs is a constructive process. \"This a life skills project. As a suicide-prevention agency the most common thing we hear from people is: 'I don't know what to do,' which is really just another way of saying they don't have enough ways of coping. Maybe quietly spilling their story to a Befriender or Samaritan will help them, but how many shades of hell have they gone through to get to that stage?\" </p> <p>\"People have been working on coping skills with 10-year-olds for some time,\" Bale says. \"We wanted to go for something far, far earlier.\" </p> <p>Where they are is in two countries with two of the highest suicide rates in the world, though this is one of the few characteristics Denmark and Lithuania share. The two locations were also chosen because of their contrasting educational systems: Denmark's classrooms are well-resourced and de-centralised from government, whereas Lithuania is the reverse, underfunded and with little independence. \"The intention,\" says Bale, \"is to see how it works in both systems.\" Were it to be a success, the programme would be rolled out to the UK and the rest of Europe which, argues Bale, would be sure to benefit whatever their suicide rates. </p> <p>\"We're trying to help children identify their emotions. We show them pictures and tell them stories. There's no mention of suicide anywhere but it isn't all a bundle of laughs. One of the children in the story gets bullied, another is from a single-parent family. These are all very real things and we talk about how the children should respond. Making children more aware of these feelings helps them look at ways of dealing with problems and asking for help,\" he says. </p> <p>Bale argues that challenging such childhood inhibitions is an intricate part of the scheme. \"We really try and stress - particularly to the boys - that it is a sign of strength to ask for help, so that if they do need to call a helpline like ours they're not coming in at the 11th hour.\" The fact that such a project might curtail drug use in children has also been a key incentive for the cooperation of the Lithuanian government. </p> <p>Nevertheless, these are expectations that have little empirical evidence behind them. Bale's language is peppered with what he \"hopes\" the exercise will achieve: \"It's a long-term and ambitious programme, but the human benefits could be enormous.\" He cites that the first stage showed a marked improvement in the children's social skills, empathy and assertiveness. Yet whether these advances will be transferable into adulthood, or whether they will make any lasting improvements to a child's mental health, is still debatable. </p> <p>\"There's no doubt that there's a developmental course of mental health difficulty where depression and some personality disorders can be traced back to childhood bereavement or loss,\" says Julia Fabricius, director of the Anna Freud Centre. \"But what I wouldn't be so sure about is what they're planning to do about it. Just putting some nice people in schools to talk to children about emotions won't necessarily be that useful.\" </p> <p>Fabricius is happy to concede that \"mental health in children is an important issue and worth starting early\". Her recommendation is for Reaching Young Europe to mimic the work of The Place To Be charity and, rather than having blanket targets across all children in a particular class or school, selecting schools in \"deprived areas where there's a lot of poverty. These are things that are bound up with poor mental health in children.\" </p> <p>However, Jennifer Smith, an educational psychologist who regularly works in the classroom, applauds the idea of an all-inclusive programme. Her concern is whether six-year-olds would be willing to open up to the project facilitators. \"At this age children are more likely to share things that concern them with somebody they know, like their class teacher.\" </p> <p>Yet Bale is anxious to point out the originality of the Reaching Young Europe project. \"What makes us quite different from other attempts is that we're not just trying to help a child to help itself but also trying to sensitise him or her to when other people have problems, and how listening to your friend helps your friend.\" </p> <p>He remains all too aware of the potential flaws of such an ambitious scheme. \"It's very difficult for us to know that these skills which they learn in early childhood are actually going to help when they're an adult. In reality, we can only do that if we have something like a 25-year monitoring programme. But I think we just have to accept that, in the same way we accept that education of a young child helps them for the rest of their life, the same thing should work here, and that the long-term benefits really could be enormous.\"</p>",

And, increasingly, those parents not actually going so far as the High Court are trundling along to appeals with a brief or solicitor in tow in the hope that legal muscle will scare a good result for them. </p> <p>League tables, Ofsted inspections and a sharpening of everyone's sense of being consumers and not mute recipients have changed the landscape. </p> <p>The number of appeals by parents against primary and secondary schools that did not admit their children rose from 77,000 in 1997-98 to 85,900 the following year. The figure for the latest school year is expected to show another leap to 95,000. </p> <p>At the same time, lawyers have found much to play with among the endless flow of legislation. Every new statute creates work for the legal profession, and since 1979, education acts have appeared at the rate of almost one a year. Latterly the acts have given education secretaries of state huge scope for issuing subsequent statutory instruments - orders and regulations filling in details. Of the 4,000 to 5,000 statutory instruments published annually by government, up to 200 concern education. </p> <p>In response to this burgeoning legislation, the Education Law Association (Elas) was set up 10 years ago to provide guidance to its membership of lawyers and educational managers. For a few years it remained an obscure body, but now it receives five inquiries a day from parents. </p> <p>\"Ten years ago you would have been hard put to find a lawyer who specialised in education,\" says Richard Clutterbuck, of Luton University, who produces the journal Education Law Monitor. Now, you can hardly move for them. Next month, London will host two conferences for them: one, chaired by Clutterbuck, is the Law Society's education law conference; the other focuses on special educational needs. </p> <p>And as the education \"consumers\" become more reliant on legal muscle, so, too, do the education \"providers\". Education matters would once have been a minor part of a municipal lawyer's duties; not any more. Jack Rabinowicz, partner at Teacher Stern Selby, a London firm, says: \"Local authorities now have a nominated lawyer in their legal department who's their education specialist.\" </p> <p>The action they face from parents comes in three categories: special needs, admissions and exclusions. </p> <p>The 1994 Code of Practice for special educational needs, which insisted that parents should be consulted, jolted them into starting to challenge decisions, says Clutterbuck. </p> <p>Since then there had been an incremental broadening of the definition of need, he says. The Court of Appeal earlier this year ruled that a tetraplegic child needed physiotherapy to get education. Unlike health services, which are rationed, educational services cannot be. Education authorities have used every procedural device to minimise numbers of children officially \"statemented\" for special provision and more parents have sought to challenge them. </p> <p>The proportion of special needs tribunal hearings - where parents appeal against decisions - to which parents are bringing lawyers is steadily rising. In 1997/98 only one in 10 parents was legally represented at the 1,200 or so cases heard each year. Last year it was one in five. </p> <p>Then, less than two months ago, a landmark House of Lords ruling upped the ante still further. Pamela Phelps, 26, was awarded \u00a345,650 damages for the west London borough of Hillingdon's failure to diagnose her dyslexia. This decision has had a predictable consequence: a deluge of calls to solicitors. </p> <p>Schools' admissions decisions where, typically, parents can't get children into their preferred secondaries because they are already full, have been more difficult to overturn since the 1998 Schools Standards and Framework act, but that hasn't stopped parents bringing lawyers in. It's cheaper to hire a lawyer than move house, says Clutterbuck, and \"it salves their conscience. Parents want to feel they've done their best for their child and if that means getting lawyers to fight appeals, they'll do it.\" </p> <p>Similarly, parents are increasingly seeking judicial review when their appeals about excluded children are turned down. Conversely, when heads readmit a child excluded for bullying, parents of the victims are starting to seek judicial review. </p> <p>Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, regrets that the presence of unstable kids, some reinstated after exclusion, has driven more teachers, including those who have been injured, to seek advice from their union lawyers about litigation. The landmark case came when a teacher, Hazel Spence-Young, won \u00a385,000 for a neck injury sustained in an assault by a pupil. </p> <p>John Friel rejects the notion that lawyers have been flooding into education as the pinch on legal aid has shrunk other activity. Some of his colleagues have pursued the speciality after fighting for their own children's needs. \"There are probably no more than 50 barristers with regular litigation experience in education.\" </p> <p>But what about 20 years ago?

A group of parents cleared away the rubbish from this overgrown and neglected corner of the grounds and marked out a proper pathway. That was the beginning of a sustainability project that has gone from strength to strength. </p> <p>On entering the school there is a wall covered with certificates - from Bexley in Bloom through to the prestigious Eco-Schools Award, evidence of the school's commitment towards green issues. </p> <p>The grounds are not huge, but with the well-planned layout they give the impression that a small child could wander for hours round ponds and through wooded secret gardens, or just sit and watch the birds and butterflies. Every aspect of the school is reviewed by the pupils for its environmental impact in order to identify targets for action and improvement. </p> <p>A plan is then drawn up involving the children, teachers, parents and local community, which is constantly monitored and evaluated. Different groups have responsibility for particular tasks: in the bird garden, where feeders of every shape and size are hung, the children in year six are responsible for watering the flowers, but the reception class fills the birdbath. This year reception have planted a hazel walk and bower, which, by the time they leave the school, will have grown into another established feature of the grounds. </p> <p>Projects are designed with this aim in mind, and the children have a sense of shared ownership in the school. Many still visit after they have left, wanting not just to check on how their own work has matured, but to see what the new kids have been up to. They also often initiate sustainability projects in their secondary schools. </p> <p>Environmental issues are integrated into the national curriculum, touching every subject. A regular science class feature is pond dipping - taking a jar of pond water and examining it and learning about the contents. The butterfly garden is planted and cared for by the children. On the wall are the descriptions and models of the different butterflies so that they can be easily identified. </p> <p>The pupils have carried out projects on waste recycling and have a policy of using both sides of the paper; the saving of energy is another high priority, with projects to design posters to remind each other to switch off the lights. The use, recycling and waste of water have found their way into maths and geography. And the environment is used in all areas of literacy, even if it is just sitting in the garden listening to a story. </p> <p>The grounds are treated as another classroom, to be appreciated all year round, not just in the summer. Outside of school hours are the Twitchers club and the Greenfingers club, the latter run by a parent whose children have now left St Paulinus - it isn't just the pupils who find it hard to leave. </p> <p>The school is very open and shares its grounds with the community and particularly with a nearby special needs school. With this in mind, the woodchip paths in the wood are wide enough to accommodate a wheelchair. Again it is the pupils' responsibility to maintain the paths, making sure they are accessible. </p> <p>The local business community is also involved, and in amongst the labels for buddleia and lavender are plaques commemorating donations from Woolwich plc and benches from Sainsbury's and Barclays. </p> <p>The Eco-Schools project aims to bring up young people to act responsibly, and acknowledge what is happening in their environment - and in turn to influence their parents and peers. Bexley council wants to encourage positive citizens. The impact across the whole school has been positive, with academic results giving as much pleasure to the parents as the green fingers give to the pupils. </p> <p>The children at St Paulinus are proud of their achievements and Nicola and Vicki from year six, members of the eco-committee, needed no prompting to offer a guided tour, even in torrential rain. There was no way the eco-rap was not going to be performed for a visitor. The eco- committee is made up of pupils, teachers, governors and parents, but the children have a major input and it is another way they can express their views and know that their ideas are valued and taken into account. </p> <p>The various projects have resulted in financial savings for the school as the managing of utilities has come under the eco-committee's eagle eye and a policy of environmental purchasing has been agreed. </p> <p>New headteacher Adam Higgins has already been well briefed on the current projects, which include a raised viewing platform and a plan for the edge of the playground. He is beginning to sound like his pupils. </p> <p>\u0095 To apply for an Eco-Schools pack (which includes a handbook on how to run a scheme like this, environmental review booklet, and curriculum ideas), contact The Tidy Britain Group, Elizabeth House, The Pier, Wigan, WN3 4EX.

Schools can claim one copy free. </p> <p>\u0095 On October 9, WWF, the global environment network, is launching a new website that aims to help teachers to understand and tackle the challenge of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD).

The Eco-Schools project aims to bring up young people to act responsibly, and acknowledge what is happening in their environment - and in turn to influence their parents and peers. Bexley council wants to encourage positive citizens. The impact across the whole school has been positive, with academic results giving as much pleasure to the parents as the green fingers give to the pupils. The children at St Paulinus are proud of their achievements and Nicola and Vicki from year six, members of the eco-committee, needed no prompting to offer a guided tour, even in torrential rain. There was no way the eco-rap was not going to be performed for a visitor. The eco- committee is made up of pupils, teachers, governors and parents, but the children have a major input and it is another way they can express their views and know that their ideas are valued and taken into account. The various projects have resulted in financial savings for the school as the managing of utilities has come under the eco-committee's eagle eye and a policy of environmental purchasing has been agreed. New headteacher Adam Higgins has already been well briefed on the current projects, which include a raised viewing platform and a plan for the edge of the playground. He is beginning to sound like his pupils. \u0095 To apply for an Eco-Schools pack (which includes a handbook on how to run a scheme like this, environmental review booklet, and curriculum ideas), contact The Tidy Britain Group, Elizabeth House, The Pier, Wigan, WN3 4EX. Tel: 01942 824 620. Schools can claim one copy free. \u0095 On October 9, WWF, the global environment network, is launching a new website that aims to help teachers to understand and tackle the challenge of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD). The WWF website will use a range of interactive tools to support curriculum development and help ensure that ESD becomes a central focus for the management of the whole school.

True, it exists mainly in the dreams of anxious parents, but what a pleasant place it is. There is freedom of expression, yet chairs never arc through classroom airspace. Knowledge is treasured, yet young minds are not oppressed by achievement targets, and neither are teachers. Schools are communities rather than institutions, and every child is seen as a special individual rather than just another inmate in some government-controlled academy of stress. </p> <p>This Saturday in central London, at the second annual Alternatives in Education Fair, a diverse group of educators, campaigners and parents will gather in the shared conviction that such a promised land not only exists, but that all children should be delivered there. The two best-known alternative education philosophies will be represented: Steiner-Waldorf, whose fellowship encompasses 26 schools and 45 kindergartens in Britain and Ireland, and the followers of Dr Maria Montessori. Also providing a presence will be Summerhill, the Suffolk secondary whose policy of making lessons voluntary recently survived a nasty brush with Ofsted. </p> <p>Those are the big names, but a growing number of smaller operators will also be espousing their own distinctive ways of making learning in some way more spiritual, less prescriptive, less impersonal - \"holistic\" is a favoured term. If there is a common theme, it is that small is beautiful. The charity Human Scale Education (HSE), which represents alternative schools and organises the fair, campaigns for small classes, smaller schools, and large schools to be \"restructured into smaller units\". </p> <p>The wish to create \"learning experiences that will develop in young people the attitudes, skills and knowledge to shape a fairer world\" is, of course, wholly admirable. But what are such schools actually like? The principles informing them can also trigger suspicions, not only among traditionalists who smell zealots and cranks. Liberal parents sympathetic to \"alternative\" ideals may also have their doubts. Is it necessarily true that virtue follows smallness? Can smallness also lead to small-mindedness, a suspicion of diversity and of majority ways? What exactly are some alternative schools an alternative to? </p> <p>The possible answers to the last question demonstrate the dangers of generalisation. Many one-off alternative schools demonstrate an intellectual position in action, just as the Steiners and Montessoris do. For example, the Educare Small School, a primary in Kingston-upon-Thames, is described by its co-founder Liz Steinthal as \"a reflection of my philosophy of teaching.\" A maximum of 50 pupils, whose parents pay \u00a3910 per term, follow the national curriculum, but also do lots of art, drama and meditation. \"It allows children to learn how to be still and silent,\" Steinthal explains, \"and how to recognise what is going on inside them instead of just what's going on around them.\" </p> <p>By contrast, the founding impulse behind the Abinger Hammer Village School, a primary near Dorking, was simply to avoid closure. It was due to be shut by the local authority in 1982, but local residents raised funds and have kept it going. The school is now financed by a trust and vigorous fundraising efforts, and attendance is free. There is no over-arching ideology, just a straightforward conviction that a village school is essential to village life. That said, trustees' secretary Shirley Corke is clear about its values: \"We like the idea of it being an unschooly school. It's not that we don't teach them anything! I sometimes help out by giving a French lesson, which gets them used to all the funny noises! But I'm not keen on children sitting down all day, struggling with too much reading and writing.\" </p> <p>The school has just one teacher and only a dozen pupils. The oldest is the sole member of year four and as such stands unchallenged as head girl. Hammond is pleased that working with such tiny numbers means she can deliver tailored learning , and thinks the modest numbers are a positive advantage in terms of social skills. \"They're like a large family. The big ones look after the little ones, and it all helps with sensitivity and communication.\" </p> <p>The failure of mainstream schools to be sensitive towards pupils with certain special needs lies behind some of the more specialist schools under the \"alternative\" umbrella. Far removed from Abinger Hammer, Home School of Stoke Newington in north London began life nine years ago as one boy and his mum - teacher Catherine Allen, now Home School's principal. She was certain her boy would flounder in a conventional secondary. Dyslexic, dreamy and, his mother says, \"unconsciously setting himself up as a victim,\" he'd already struggled at primary school, and had been baffled by basic rules. \"He couldn't understand why he had to ask if he could go to the toilet,\" Allen recalls. \"He thought that was mad.\" </p> <p>Her son's sense of disconnection was underlined for him by the contrast between himself and his twin sister. Where she was tuned-in and confident, he was \"busy off with the birds\". So while her daughter moved up smoothly into secondary schooling, Allen gave up her career and began teaching her son at home. \"Educationally, that was fine,\" she says. \"But where were the mates?\" After a couple of years she placed an ad in the local paper. Her son described the day he was first joined by two additional pupils as the best one of his life. </p> <p>Most lessons take place in two rooms of Allen's terraced house. There is lots of artwork, plenty of books, computers, a piano, some old-fashioned school desks and a warm atmosphere. Fees are \u00a32,700 per term. The school has nine teachers, most part-time, and 10 pupils - all boys, though girls are welcome. Most suffer from dyslexia, though the school also takes children who are school phobic or have been bullied. </p> <p>A sympathetic inspector described Home School's pupils as \"mainstream refugees\". Allen thinks that's about right: they aren't children who'd qualify for a special needs statement, yet a normal secondary school simply can't give them what they need. And maybe the description could bear a broader application. The growing interest in alternative and home schooling suggests that more children and parents are seeking refuge from an education culture increasingly dominated by a tests-and-targets ethos and the spectre of disaffection and decay. </p> <p>Do the alternatives have the answer? HSE coordinator Fiona Carnie emphasises that her organisation wants to see the most innovative values of the alternative movement backed with public money and practised at the heart of the state system. \"All children need to have a nurturing, caring school environment,\" she says.

      "body": "<p>In a recent circular, Eton warns prospective parents to prepare for fees of \u00a360,000 by the year 2020. Many parents find the current fees quite high enough, and opt for less prestigious boarding schools, but even these are unlikely to leave much change out of \u00a315,000 a year once \"extras\" are taken into account. Not surprisingly, independent schools are seeing their boarding numbers drop as families count the cost and opt for day schooling. </p> <p>But thousands of parents still grit their teeth and write the cheque. Some feel they have little choice. A report by the Henley Centre identified the kind of parents who, while never boarders themselves, are considering boarding for their children. These \"Double Income in a Hurry\" families are trying to give their children some degree of constancy in what is often a whirlwind family life. </p> <p>But there is an alternative. Adams in Shropshire is a 350-year-old school with a strong academic record. It was founded by Lord Mayor of London Sir Thomas Adams in 1650. Farmers' sons would arrive on horseback on a Monday and leave on Fridays to return to the plough. Boarding fees at Adams are just over \u00a35,000 per year. A family could send four children to the school for the cost of one place at Eton. Not surprisingly, the boarding house is full and there is a waiting list. The surprise comes with the type of school. Adams is a state school, a comprehensive. </p> <p>\"Most people don't know about us, they've never heard of the system,\" says Gillian Brierley, who manages boarding at the school. \"There's a reaction of, 'Why are you so cheap? Is it because you're second-rate?' To which the answer is no, we are a state school, but the results are excellent.\" </p> <p>There are 36 state boarding schools in England offering 4,000 places. Fees range from \u00a31,450 to \u00a32,200 a term and the schools cover the whole range of state provision, from boys' grammar schools to city comprehensives. The largest is Wymondham in Norfolk with 500 boarders, but the majority, like Adams, have relatively small boarding houses. </p> <p>The local education authority meets tuition costs as they would for any other child at the school. Fees cover accommodation, food and other expenses. In the 1960s there were nearly 200 such schools, but many were allowed to wither away. </p> <p>Today Adams has 54 boarders. Brierley believes the changing employment climate is creating more demand for the kind of settled schooling that boarders benefit from. \"There's an awful lot of movement of parents, especially now that most mothers are working as well. A lot work full-time and send their child here for weekly boarding. People are just much more mobile than they used to be.\" </p> <p>Geoffrey and Kristine are different. They had no option but to send their three daughters to boarding school. The Taylors live on Bryher, the smallest of the Isles of Scilly, where there is no school at all. \"There are a lot of tidal problems even in good weather,\" says Geoff Taylor. \"Sometimes you can't get off the island.\" The family's three girls go to Adams. </p> <p>\"It's only in the last five or six years that people discovered state boarding as an option,\" says Geoff. \"On Scilly, kids aren't streetwise. They needed to have somewhere that offered both a secure environment and an opportunity to experience a degree of freedom, to make the transition.\" The family are certainly not worried about the education their daughters received. The two elder girls did well; Rosamund, currently head girl at Adams, is applying to Oxford this year. \"It's very different from being at home,\" she says. \"But in a good way; I've gained more independence. Boarding is a good half-way step between home and university.\" Relationships with other pupils at the school are good. \"I've got friends from the boarding house and friends from college,\" says Rosamund. Teachers report that boarders get on well with the day pupils, with sleepovers in the boarding house a popular option. </p> <p>Just why state boarding should be the best-kept secret in UK education is a mystery. Wymondham's head, Victoria Musgrave, says that the Department for Education and Employment has to be constantly reminded of the school's existence. A DfEE information booklet does exist but it isn't heavily promoted. </p> <p>Inevitably, given the fees charged, the boarders in these schools tend to be middle-class. Heads in the \"comprehensive\" boarding schools claim a balanced intake, but at least one Midlands head believes that Stourbridge's Old Swinford School cannot justifiably claim to be a comprehensive school. </p> <p>\"It selects by parental income,\" she says. It's noticeable that schools with larger boarding houses like Old Swinford and Wymondham achieve much higher GCSE results than some of the smaller boarding establishments attached to schools with a more comprehensive intake. But Wymondham's Victoria Musgrave argues that the results are down to a school culture that values endeavour. </p> <p>\"They really worked their socks off for those results,\" she says. In the past, some boarding-school places were filled by social services departments that would select young people who needed to live apart from their family.

      "bodyText": "More than five millennia after being entombed in an Alpine glacier, Oetzi the iceman was defrosted yesterday so scientists could try to extract his last secret: why he died. DNA samples and tooth enamel were scraped from the mummified body which has been hailed as one of the most significant archaeological discoveries of the 20th century. His home for the past two years, a \u00a31m refrigerator in Bolzano, northern Italy, was warmed up from its usual - 6C (21F) for two hours. Samples from his left knee, intestine and mouth could shed light on neolithic migration patterns, diet, disease and burial customs. Researchers hope to establish where he spent his childhood. Discovered on a glacier at an altitude of 3,000m (10,000ft) by hikers in 1991, the body was so well preserved it was mistaken for a modern-day mountaineer killed in an avalanche. Aged about 45, weighing six stone and 5ft 5in tall, the shepherd from the copper age was the oldest and best preserved mummy ever found. The goatskin leggings, grass cape, copper-headed axe and arrows found nearby have provided a historical treasure trove. Yesterday's lifting of restrictions so that tissue samples could be taken is expected to fill the gaps in the reconstructed life story of Oetzi, named after a local valley. \"Our inquiry will focus on the circumstances of his death,\" said Franco Tagliaro, of the University of Rome. \"We will examine the disposition of blood at the moment of death and, in particular, we will study signs of lesions found on the mummy, to establish with certainty if they were present before or after death.\" Despite the pinpointing of age, occupation, medical ailments (arthritis and diarrhoea) and even last meal (goat and plum), Oetzi's death has remained a mystery. Jim Dickson, professor of archaeobotany at the University of Glasgow, concluded after a five-year study that he was probably caught in a storm, crawled into a hollow and froze to death on the border of modern day Italy and Switzerland. Italian and British neurologists will compare his DNA with modern inhabitants of Italy's Alto Adige region to see if they are his descendants. The corpse has been defrosted several times before but the samples have never been subjected to such sophisticated techniques.",

He threatened terrified staff with his gun after they insisted that he had got the wrong hospital.

      "body": "<p>The golden hour will come just after 2.15 this afternoon. That's the moment the tens of thousands of delegates, journalists and assorted hangers-on gathered in Brighton are waiting for. Once it's passed, the energy will suck out of the Brighton Centre like air from a birthday balloon. In a party conference, the leader's speech is all.</p> <p>Tony Blair knows that. That's why he will have spent last night doing yet another read-through, and why he will probably wield the editorial pencil a few more times this morning. He will have rehearsed his delivery, trying out the key lines for Alastair Campbell's approval - just as he does in the Rory Bremner send-up.</p> <p>In fact, Campbell and others will have been toiling on this speech for months. On the other side of summer the brainboxes of Downing Street, led by the head of the policy unit, David Miliband, would have been asked for \"input\" on the substance of the address, submitting chunks on education, health, tax. Throughout the process, Gordon Brown and Peter Mandelson, along with Campbell, will have kept a close eye on the core message. All the while, No 10's hired wordsmiths, including Campbell himself, will have been striving to turn those memos and political instructions into ear-friendly prose.</p> <p>Every element is treated with deadly seriousness - including the gags. John O'Farrell, the satirist and Guardian columnist, was drafted in to write Blair's jokes. He, along with the others, will have heard the dreaded word \"rewrite\" a dozen times in the past two weeks - as the team edited the text to take account first of Mo Mowlam's departure, then the Dome debacle, then the fuel crisis and now demands for higher pensions.</p> <p>But why all this trouble over a mere address? Surely Downing Street knows the conventional wisdom is that the political speech is dead? After all, a subtle part of the New Labour revolution was a shift away from the thundering oratory of the party's past - exemplified by the likes of Tony Benn, Michael Foot and Neil Kinnock - and towards the softer, more telegenic style of Tony Blair. Podium-banging and tub-thumping went out with clause four.</p> <p>The evidence for the death of the speech seems persuasive enough. The great barnstormers are either dead or dying, unreplaced by their successors in the Commons or elsewhere. TV is said to have killed off the public meeting, where rhetoric found its most natural home. The new generation of leaders have cultivated a kind of anti-oratory - typified by Charles Kennedy - in which the stirring passage is deliberately replaced by the relaxed, chatty aside which prompts barely a ripple in the hall but plays well on television. As if to illustrate the shift, much of today's news is made far away from the podium. Who remembers the great public speech which ignited the fuel protest movement? There wasn't one. Or think of one of Blair's most memorable phrases: \"I'm a pretty straight kind of guy.\" He said that in a TV interview.</p> <p>Despite all that, the Labour party - both leaders and followers - seem to think that today's speech matters. The funny thing is, they're right. For, regardless of fashion, political speeches can still turn fate around. Not perhaps in the romantic, Shakespearean sense - in which a single oration by a Mark Antony can persuade a nation to change course - but a few words, chosen well or ill, can still reshape the political landscape.</p> <p>The Blairites have a favourite example, one from which they've drawn much comfort in recent days. In the US their fellow apostle of the Third Way, Al Gore, was also languishing in the polls behind a conservative promising lower taxes and a shrunken state. Gore, too, had to do something to haul himself and his party out of the hole. The solution was a speech - his acceptance address at last month's Democratic convention in Los Angeles. Gore won plaudits for his energy, his concentration on substance and his uncharacteristic (if deliberate) non-woodenness, including a semi-pornographic snog with his wife Tipper. The result was a an extraordinary double-digit surge in the ratings. Not that Blair needs too many lessons from America on the enduring power of the speech. Comfy though he may be on the sofas of David Frost and Richard &amp; Judy, Blair knows all too well how a set-piece address can make all the difference. For one thing, he laid the foundations of New Labour with his first leader's speech to the Labour conference in Blackpool in 1994. He told activists then that a modern party needed \"a modern constitution\" - code for the rewriting of clause four, the emblematic battle which defined Blair in opposition. A year later Blair used the leader's speech to trail another dramatic shift, not just for Labour but the entire nation. He presaged both the landslide of 1997 and the Cool Britannia phenomenon when he spoke of his ambition to make Britain \"a young country again.\"</p> <p>Indeed, for all of its famous felicity with the techniques of modern political combat - websites, rapid rebuttal, pagers and the rest - the evolution of the entire New Labour project can be traced through a series of landmark low-tech speeches. Besides Blair's own efforts, John Prescott's 1993 plea for Labour delegates to move to a system of one member, one vote still stands out as a key moment in the birth of the new regime. No matter that it read in print like a corrupted computer file; the spirit was what mattered, not the syntax. The modernisation of New Labour took a stride forward, and Prescott solidified his status as the reformers' indispensable ambassador to the party.</p> <p>Earlier still, the very first step towards the transformation of Labour came in a speech from the conference platform. In 1985 Neil Kinnock stunned a Bournemouth audience by rounding on the Militant-infiltrated local authority in Liverpool. \"You end in the grotesque chaos of a Labour council,\" Kinnock raged, \"a Labour council - hiring taxis to scuttle round a city handing out redundancy notices to its own workers!\" The target of his ire, Derek Hatton, was sitting just a few yards away, leaping to his feet to denounce Kinnock as a \"liar, liar\". The whole scene was played over and over on the TV news. The episode told the nation that Labour wanted to change, that the days of left-wing extremism were coming to an end. David Owen has spoken of Kinnock's Bournemouth turn as the precise moment when he knew his own Social Democratic dream would fail; Labour was clearly coming back to claim the centre ground it had once abandoned. All that in a single speech.</p> <p>The explanation for Kinnock's success 15 years ago is not too complex. For that address contained one of the core ingredients of any good speech: confrontation. Margaret Thatcher had played the same trick just three years earlier, when she used her conference turn to round on critics who had demanded a U-turn in policy. \"You turn if you want to she said,\" she boomed famously. \"The lady's not for turning.\"</p> <p>Nor is such aggressive speech-making confined to politics. Earl Spencer sent shock-waves through Westminster Abbey and beyond when he turned on the royal family during his funeral oration for his sister Diana in 1997. Speaking for Diana's \"blood family\", he promised to let the souls of Diana's sons sing - unmistakably damning the stifling grip of the stuffy Windsors. Which is not to say that the decisive speech always works wonders for the speaker. On the contrary, careers can be broken as well as made by the unpredictable alchemy of orator, audience and text. Spencer's own fall from grace was speeded by a public perception that he had failed abjectly to live up to his rhetoric. Michael Portillo made himself a national hate figure when he dragged the SAS into party politics with his Who Dares Wins address to the Conservative conference of 1995. His rant against the meddlers of Brussels and his bellicose revelling in British military prowess brought delighted squeals in the hall, but made him a poster boy for Tory extremism. He paid the price in the sheer national delight that greeted his ejection from the House of Commons two years later.</p> <p>His former Cabinet ally Peter Lilley also learned of the lethal power of an ill-judged talk. As the Tories' deputy leader in 1999, he chose to mark the 20th anniversary of Margaret Thatcher's arrival in Downing Street with a lecture apparently recanting the old Thatcherite faith in the free market's ability to deliver public services. The backlash from the Conservative true believers was so intense that Lilley had to pay with his job - removed as William Hague's number two and booted out of the shadow cabinet.</p> <p>Speeches have turned nearly as sour for Tony Blair. When he looks back on the annus horribilis that 2000 has been for Labour, a particularly bitter memory will be the slow hand-clap he received from the Women's Institute. He gave a speech that they deemed too political and they booed him for it. Or he may cast his mind back even further, to the roots of the current trouble, by recalling his address to last year's Labour conference, when he declared war on the \"forces of conservatism\". A right-wing press which had previously given a free pass to Blair decided that New Labour's honeymoon was over: from that day onwards something of the old left-right struggle returned to our national life.</p> <p>So speeches can still be decisive, for good or ill. They don't work the way myth said they once did: hostile audiences are rarely won over with a few poetic sentences. Nor are there many of the great phrase-makers of yore - Kennedy and his \"new frontier\", Churchill and his \"iron curtain\". Still, it is possible to train oneself into good oratory. Bill Clinton is rated as perhaps the best communicator on the planet, but when, as a little-known state governor, he delivered a keynote address to the 1988 Democratic convention, he rambled and stuttered so badly that delegates cheered when he finally left the stage.</p> <p>For all that, the improved Clinton is proof that an address written well and delivered better can change minds. Not by reaching a nation all at once - that only happens through television. But if a speaker convinces the people in the hall and, crucially, impresses the journalists present, then the climate of opinion can change. If every commentator tonight and tomorrow says Blair did well, then he will have done well: it will soon settle into the collective cortex that the PM has reasserted his grip. And that message will reach millions more than the select group of activists and addicts who will actually watch today's speech.</p> <p>These are the times we live in - our politics reliant on an ancient form, refracted through the medium of today. Or, put another way, \"traditional values in a modern setting\". Hmm, that's got quite a nice ring to it. I wonder if Tony might want to weave that into paragraph four...</p>",

The result was a an extraordinary double-digit surge in the ratings. Not that Blair needs too many lessons from America on the enduring power of the speech. Comfy though he may be on the sofas of David Frost and Richard &amp; Judy, Blair knows all too well how a set-piece address can make all the difference. For one thing, he laid the foundations of New Labour with his first leader's speech to the Labour conference in Blackpool in 1994. He told activists then that a modern party needed \"a modern constitution\" - code for the rewriting of clause four, the emblematic battle which defined Blair in opposition. A year later Blair used the leader's speech to trail another dramatic shift, not just for Labour but the entire nation. He presaged both the landslide of 1997 and the Cool Britannia phenomenon when he spoke of his ambition to make Britain \"a young country again.\" Indeed, for all of its famous felicity with the techniques of modern political combat - websites, rapid rebuttal, pagers and the rest - the evolution of the entire New Labour project can be traced through a series of landmark low-tech speeches. Besides Blair's own efforts, John Prescott's 1993 plea for Labour delegates to move to a system of one member, one vote still stands out as a key moment in the birth of the new regime. No matter that it read in print like a corrupted computer file; the spirit was what mattered, not the syntax. The modernisation of New Labour took a stride forward, and Prescott solidified his status as the reformers' indispensable ambassador to the party. Earlier still, the very first step towards the transformation of Labour came in a speech from the conference platform. In 1985 Neil Kinnock stunned a Bournemouth audience by rounding on the Militant-infiltrated local authority in Liverpool. \"You end in the grotesque chaos of a Labour council,\" Kinnock raged, \"a Labour council - hiring taxis to scuttle round a city handing out redundancy notices to its own workers!\" The target of his ire, Derek Hatton, was sitting just a few yards away, leaping to his feet to denounce Kinnock as a \"liar, liar\". The whole scene was played over and over on the TV news. The episode told the nation that Labour wanted to change, that the days of left-wing extremism were coming to an end. David Owen has spoken of Kinnock's Bournemouth turn as the precise moment when he knew his own Social Democratic dream would fail; Labour was clearly coming back to claim the centre ground it had once abandoned. All that in a single speech. The explanation for Kinnock's success 15 years ago is not too complex. For that address contained one of the core ingredients of any good speech: confrontation. Margaret Thatcher had played the same trick just three years earlier, when she used her conference turn to round on critics who had demanded a U-turn in policy. \"You turn if you want to she said,\" she boomed famously. \"The lady's not for turning.\" Nor is such aggressive speech-making confined to politics. Earl Spencer sent shock-waves through Westminster Abbey and beyond when he turned on the royal family during his funeral oration for his sister Diana in 1997. Speaking for Diana's \"blood family\", he promised to let the souls of Diana's sons sing - unmistakably damning the stifling grip of the stuffy Windsors. Which is not to say that the decisive speech always works wonders for the speaker. On the contrary, careers can be broken as well as made by the unpredictable alchemy of orator, audience and text. Spencer's own fall from grace was speeded by a public perception that he had failed abjectly to live up to his rhetoric. Michael Portillo made himself a national hate figure when he dragged the SAS into party politics with his Who Dares Wins address to the Conservative conference of 1995. His rant against the meddlers of Brussels and his bellicose revelling in British military prowess brought delighted squeals in the hall, but made him a poster boy for Tory extremism. He paid the price in the sheer national delight that greeted his ejection from the House of Commons two years later. His former Cabinet ally Peter Lilley also learned of the lethal power of an ill-judged talk. As the Tories' deputy leader in 1999, he chose to mark the 20th anniversary of Margaret Thatcher's arrival in Downing Street with a lecture apparently recanting the old Thatcherite faith in the free market's ability to deliver public services. The backlash from the Conservative true believers was so intense that Lilley had to pay with his job - removed as William Hague's number two and booted out of the shadow cabinet. Speeches have turned nearly as sour for Tony Blair. When he looks back on the annus horribilis that 2000 has been for Labour, a particularly bitter memory will be the slow hand-clap he received from the Women's Institute. He gave a speech that they deemed too political and they booed him for it. Or he may cast his mind back even further, to the roots of the current trouble, by recalling his address to last year's Labour conference, when he declared war on the \"forces of conservatism\". A right-wing press which had previously given a free pass to Blair decided that New Labour's honeymoon was over: from that day onwards something of the old left-right struggle returned to our national life. So speeches can still be decisive, for good or ill. They don't work the way myth said they once did: hostile audiences are rarely won over with a few poetic sentences. Nor are there many of the great phrase-makers of yore - Kennedy and his \"new frontier\", Churchill and his \"iron curtain\". Still, it is possible to train oneself into good oratory. Bill Clinton is rated as perhaps the best communicator on the planet, but when, as a little-known state governor, he delivered a keynote address to the 1988 Democratic convention, he rambled and stuttered so badly that delegates cheered when he finally left the stage. For all that, the improved Clinton is proof that an address written well and delivered better can change minds. Not by reaching a nation all at once - that only happens through television. But if a speaker convinces the people in the hall and, crucially, impresses the journalists present, then the climate of opinion can change. If every commentator tonight and tomorrow says Blair did well, then he will have done well: it will soon settle into the collective cortex that the PM has reasserted his grip. And that message will reach millions more than the select group of activists and addicts who will actually watch today's speech. These are the times we live in - our politics reliant on an ancient form, refracted through the medium of today. Or, put another way, \"traditional values in a modern setting\". Hmm, that's got quite a nice ring to it. I wonder if Tony might want to weave that into paragraph four...",

His remarks came after the Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, warned that the government must introduce the Patten report in full. \"The people who voted for the Good Friday agreement must have their mandates fulfilled in terms of the implementation of [Patten], as opposed to it being usurped and subverted by a British government because of difficulties in unionism.\" The West Belfast MP was speaking at Stormont at the launch of a 34-page Sinn Fein document, which outlined ways in which the government had watered down the Patten recommendations in the new policing bill. However, the Ulster Unionists reiterated their determination to oppose the Patten report. Sir Reg Empey, the UUP enterprise minister, said: \"People cannot understand how you contemplate reducing the number of police officers in a situation where you do not have the peace and stability against which the Patten proposals were drawn up.\" Meanwhile, police in Northern Ireland were still investigating the death of a leading loyalist paramilitary after earlier fears that he had fallen victim to the feud in the Shankill Road area of Belfast. John White, chairman of the Ulster Defence Association, close to the Ulster Defence Association, played down suggestions Stevie McKeag, 29, was the fourth victim in the month-long loyalist vendetta. The postmortem examination on McKeag, a former member of the UDA, sister to the Ulster Freedom Fighters, was inconclusive. One report suggested that he had suffered bruising to his face while another indicated he had suffered a drugs overdose. McKeag was cleared in 1994 of murdering Sean Hughes, 40, a Catholic father of three. Two UDA gunmen shot him dead in west Belfast. The trial judge said he was unhappy with identification evidence. A lawyer said during a bail hearing that police believed he was \"a very active terrorist\" in the UFF. McKeag had played little active role in the UDA since suffering serious injuries in a motorcyle crash two years ago. Mr White said: \"No one else was involved in his death. He has been taking painkillers since his motorbike accident and it appears he was drinking at the same time.\"",

The sources insisted Nato would not go to war over Montenegro. The foreign secretary, Robin Cook, said: \"Today Milosevic is a beaten, broken-backed president. The margin of defeat appears too great to fix through electoral fraud. My message to him today is to be honest with your people, do not cheat them. Get out of the way and let Serbia out of the prison into which you have turned it.\" The White House national security adviser, PJ Crowley, said it would be hard for Mr Milosevic to make a \"credible claim of victory\" because of strong opposition support and reported voting irregularities. Mr Crowley said: \"They haven't announced any election results at this point but the reliable information coming out of Yugoslavia suggests that the opposition has done very well.\" In Brussels, the EU insisted that Mr Milosevic could not declare himself the winner. \"It is clear that any attempt by Milosevic to declare himself the victor would be fraudulent,\" the EU said in a joint statement released by France, which holds the rotating presidency. The statement said the high turnout showed that the people of Serbia wanted change. \"They wanted to speak up, regardless of intimidation, manoeuvring, pressure and all sorts of manipulation by the Belgrade regime leading up to this ballot,\" said the statement. Javier Solana, the EU's foreign policy supremo, and Nato secretary-general during last year's Kosovo war, said Yugoslavia had to respect the will of its people. \"The people of Serbia have delivered an overwhelming vote for change. The turnout is remarkable by any standards. The clearly expressed will of the voters must now be translated into reality. The people of Serbia deserve nothing less,\" he said. Before the presidential and parliamentary elections on Sunday, the EU had pleaded with the Serbian people to turn out and vote to remove Mr Milosevic. Last week it repeated its promise to lift sanctions and offered reconstruction aid and help the country out of its international isolation. Nato made no comment yesterday, insisting that the election was a political, not a military matter. The party of the Western-backed Bosnian Serb prime minister, Milorad Dodik, saluted what it said was electoral defeat for Mr Milosevic. \"The defeat of Slobodan Milosevic is the defeat of the forces of the past, the defeat of the politics of conflict and isolation,\" the Party of Independent Social Democrats said. The Croatian president, Stipe Mesic, predicted that Mr Milosevic would do anything to stay in power in Yugoslavia, no matter how much blood had to be shed. \"Remaining in power is the only guarantee for him to stay alive, not politically but literally alive,\" Mr Mesic said in a state radio interview The British shadow foreign secretary, Francis Maude, said Serbs were tired of Mr Milosevic's \"gross misrule\". Mr Maude said: \"He must now step down. Whatever the election results, Kosovo's Albanians are clear that they do not wish to be governed from Belgrade. The international community now needs to take urgent steps to address this.\" Useful links Serbian ministry of information Serbian Democratic Opposition International Criminal Tribunal indictment of Milosevic",

      "body": "<p>Gordon Brown sat down to a massive ovation after a dazzlingly successful speech. He had tackled the twin problems of the Ecclestone fib and the petrol crisis head on - by ignoring them. Was he contrite? No. His speech was as packed with contrition as a frog is full of toothpaste. But the Labour party has decided it adores him. The stamping and applauding and cheering continued for a ages, and became even more hysterical when his wife Sarah ran to join him on the platform. As they descended a vast, heaving mob of cameramen climbed up on each other.</p> <p>The Browns saw the tottering, heaving phalynx advancing upon them. They fled backstage, and finally the cheering stopped.</p> <p>The reception Mr Brown received was as demented as the prime minister will get this afternoon and possibly more so. And it can't be co-incidence that he ended with the last words John Smith said in public: \"the opportunity to serve; that is all we ask.\" (This is politician-speak for \"the chance to grab a hold of power; that is all we demand\".)</p> <p>Mr Blair sat on stage clapping and beaming as if his life depended on it, which it possibly does. One imagines him saying sibilantly to the chancellor afterwards, \"That was jolly, jolly good, Gordon. Now I'm afraid I'm going to have to kill you...\"</p> <p>I myself was fascinated by the way that the chancellor now makes his points through elaborate hand gestures. If he'd picked up a piece of A4 at the start of the speech he'd have ended with an origami swan. \"To build on success...\" was emphasised by both hands out with thumbs up - hitchhiking on two carriageways. There's the frantic flap (\"Help! I am being pursued by flesh-eating zombies\") and the one where he pulls apart two fighting crabs. In another he hammers a point home by cupping Madonna's bustier, and \"unemployment, the lowest for a generation\" was emphasised by the hand made into a fist with the index finger pointing up. All this conveyed a passion and conviction mere words could not express. No wonder they were driven to a frenzy.</p> <p>Earlier we heard from Peter Mandelson, who spoke about Northern Ireland. For most delegates this was the equivalent of having Beelzebub up to make a speech about flower arranging. He did not get a standing ovation; instead the applause resembled the sound of empty crisp packets blowing across an playground.</p> <p>By contrast, John Prescott was received with rapture.

      "bodyText": "Gordon Brown sat down to a massive ovation after a dazzlingly successful speech. He had tackled the twin problems of the Ecclestone fib and the petrol crisis head on - by ignoring them. Was he contrite? No. His speech was as packed with contrition as a frog is full of toothpaste. But the Labour party has decided it adores him. The stamping and applauding and cheering continued for a ages, and became even more hysterical when his wife Sarah ran to join him on the platform. As they descended a vast, heaving mob of cameramen climbed up on each other. The Browns saw the tottering, heaving phalynx advancing upon them. They fled backstage, and finally the cheering stopped. The reception Mr Brown received was as demented as the prime minister will get this afternoon and possibly more so. And it can't be co-incidence that he ended with the last words John Smith said in public: \"the opportunity to serve; that is all we ask.\" (This is politician-speak for \"the chance to grab a hold of power; that is all we demand\".) Mr Blair sat on stage clapping and beaming as if his life depended on it, which it possibly does. One imagines him saying sibilantly to the chancellor afterwards, \"That was jolly, jolly good, Gordon. Now I'm afraid I'm going to have to kill you...\" I myself was fascinated by the way that the chancellor now makes his points through elaborate hand gestures. If he'd picked up a piece of A4 at the start of the speech he'd have ended with an origami swan. \"To build on success...\" was emphasised by both hands out with thumbs up - hitchhiking on two carriageways. There's the frantic flap (\"Help! I am being pursued by flesh-eating zombies\") and the one where he pulls apart two fighting crabs. In another he hammers a point home by cupping Madonna's bustier, and \"unemployment, the lowest for a generation\" was emphasised by the hand made into a fist with the index finger pointing up. All this conveyed a passion and conviction mere words could not express. No wonder they were driven to a frenzy. Earlier we heard from Peter Mandelson, who spoke about Northern Ireland. For most delegates this was the equivalent of having Beelzebub up to make a speech about flower arranging. He did not get a standing ovation; instead the applause resembled the sound of empty crisp packets blowing across an playground. By contrast, John Prescott was received with rapture. A Prescott speech resembles a bull charging an imaginary matador. It's impressive, even fearsome, but now and again the cape is whisked away and he's impaled himself on the planking. Under Labour, he said, \"you'll have noticed - no water bans or hosepipe crises\". That's because we've had all that rain, I wanted to shout. It's certainly a first - even this government has never before taken credit for the weather. \"Citizens make cities and cities make citizens,\" he raved. \"How true that is!\" We wondered what on earth it meant. In the exciting world of John Prescott nobody ever makes a mere decision: on trains, \"we shall make a decisive decision!\" he told us. He got huge applause for his attacks on farmer, hauliers and huntspersons. \"Did you see the Countryside Alliance outside, with their contorted faces?\" he asked, his face contorted. He did refer to the fuel protests: \"that is no way to make decisions in a democratic country,\" he said, adding: \"they should make decisions the British way - by bunging a million quid to the Labour party.\" No, silly, of course he didn't say the last bit.",

      "bodyText": "Ken Livingstone yesterday threatened legal action if John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, pressed ahead with his plans to part-privatise the London Underground, after an independent report damned them as offering poor value for money and potentially risking the safety of passengers. London's mayor, who is due to take over the tube only after the private contracts are locked in place, said it would now be unreasonable in law for the government to carry on with its public-private partnership unless there were radical changes to the scheme. His remarks were made as government sources said that conflict between the Treasury and Mr Prescott's Transport and Environment Department over how to finance tube modernisation were hampering attempts to achieve a workable political compromise over the issue. Tony Blair conceded during the London mayoral election that it would be difficult to go ahead with part-privatisation of the tube if Mr Livingstone were elected, but the government now appears determined to force through the scheme. Yesterday's report by Will Hutton, chief executive of the Industrial Society think tank, commissioned at Labour's insistence, argued that the PPP should be abandoned in favour of a bond-financed public sector option, unless tougher safeguards on safety, contract compliance and value for money are introduced. \"I would have thought to proceed now in the light of Will Hutton's complaints, unless they adapt and take on board his points, there is an opening for a judicial review of the decision,\" said Mr Livingstone. \"I am not opposed to partnership with the private sector on principle, but this is a rotten deal which binds London for 30 years to overgenerous contracts giving private sector monopolies intolerable powers over London's democratically-elected authorities\". The Rail Maritime and Transport union's senior tube official, Bob Crow, yesterday raised the prospect of a strike over safety on the London Underground, while Mick Rix, general secretary of the train drivers' union Aslef, said the Hutton report had blown a hole through the government's case for PPP. \"The government must now think again and start listening to the trade unions, the elected London mayor and Londoners who voted for him on a platform of a properly funded, publicly owned future for the tube.\"",

      "bodyText": "Farmer Tony Martin, who was jailed for life in April for murdering a teenage burglar, was yesterday told that he would not receive legal aid to fund his appeal against the conviction. The ruling means that Martin, 55, could be forced to sell his Norfolk farm to fund his legal fight. During a preliminary appeal court hearing Martin's new legal team said it wanted vital papers from the solicitors whom Martin had instructed for the original trial at Norwich crown court but has since sacked. And outside court it emerged that the new team is contemplating civil action against the previous solicitors in connection with money which had been held in a trust fund for Martin's case. Martin's new solicitor, James Saunders, said after the hearing: \"We're determined that Tony Martin's case will be properly prepared for the court of appeal. We're hoping to find some money to finance that. \"If no one helps him he will have to sell the very thing that provides him with his purpose in life - his farm. In order to be free, to get back to his previous life, he will have to destroy his previous life.\" A court can rule that a person has sufficient wealth to fund an appeal. The value of Martin's assets is not known but he does have valuable farmland and machinery as well as his dilapidated farmhouse. Martin's new legal team told the court it was hampered because the farmer's previous solicitors, Leicestershire-based M&amp;S Solicitors Ltd, had not handed over papers which could help in the appeal. It is thought that one of the arguments the new team could put forward is that medical issues could have had an impact on Martin's state of mind. The farmer's new lawyers want to find out if this was discussed with Martin and if any steps were taken to draw up a report on his psychiatric state. Another bone of contention between the old and new legal teams is a trust fund set up to help Martin's fight. The various problems mean that the appeal, which had been expected to be heard this autumn, might not take place until the start of next year. Nick Makin, of M&amp;S Solicitors, said that his firm was hanging on to the case papers until costs due from the legal aid authorities were paid. He said he was not aware of any action in relation to the trust fund - the firm was happy to transfer the funds in accordance with the trustees' instructions.",

Redgrave did receive a special IOC pin from Mr Samaranch. \u0095 In a review of Provamel Soya Fruity drink, The Guzzler, G2 page 7, September 15, we said it was \"far from calorie-free - 243 per 100ml\". In fact, it has only 58 calories per 100ml, though 243 kilojoules. \u0095 The fashion label Boyd beat Matthew Williamson for the New Generation prize at this year's British Fashion Awards, not Joseph and Ghost, as we said in a piece on London Fashion Week, Stepping Out, G2 page 14, yesterday. \u0095 Professor Struther Arnott is no longer principal and vice-chancellor at the University of St Andrews (Birthdays, page 18, yesterday). He retired on January 1 this year. \u0095 It is the policy of the Guardian to correct significant errors as soon as possible. Please quote the date and page number.

      "bodyText": "Lady Jay yesterday claimed she was in touch with the countryside as she had a \"little cottage\" she visited most weekends. Labour's leader in the Lords was accused by the Tories of being \"arrogant and snooty\" after an attempt to prove she understood rural problems, including fuel prices, backfired. Lady Jay told BBC TV's conference programme that the government opposed protests but was sympathetic to the plight of country dwellers. And the peer, who has cottages in Oxfordshire and Cork, said she knew of the problems through her weekend breaks. Her comments, as Countryside Alliance demonstrated in Brighton, followed a fierce attack on the \"contorted faces\" of the protesters by the deputy prime minister John Prescott, who has also insisted that he knows rural Britain. \"John Prescott made a very vivid reference to how, as a small child he was taken to the Lake District and how this opened his eyes to the beauties and importance of the countryside,\" she said. \"We've all had those experiences. I have a little cottage in the country that I enjoy enormously. I'm not anti countryside, but I am anti vested interests.\" Lady Jay sparked a row this year when she said she went to a \"pretty standard\" school. In fact, her alma mater, Blackheath high school, was not part of the state system. The Oxfordshire cottage that Lady Jay, who was born in south-east London, visits most frequently was inherited by her husband from his parents. Tim Collins, Tory MP for rural Westmorland and Lonsdale, said Lady Jay's remarks \"show she is determined to keep her title as the most arrogant and snooty member of the government\". A Countryside Alliance spokesman said: \"The countryside is the workplace for hundreds of thousands of people. It's a lot more than a weekend retreat for politicians.\"",

      "bodyText": "Lord Falconer, the beleaguered dome minister, expressed the government's strongest admission of penitence yet over the controversial structure yesterday - but refused to apologise and insisted he would not be resigning. In a Guardian debate entitled Has Labour forgotten its roots?, the QC and close friend of the prime minister admitted the government had \"made mistakes\" in building the attraction and confessed: \"I accept it hasn't been the success that people wanted.\" Speaking after a new report suggested accountants cast doubt on the Millennium Dome's viability three years ago, he continued: \"I also accept that there have been real concerns about the way it [the decision to build it] was reached in the first place and whether the money was handled in the right way\" But he insisted: \"We did it with the best possible motives and we did it in a way which has brought jobs and regeneration.\" The minister's muted confession - which he later insisted did not mean he would be resigning - was backed up by the culture minister Chris Smith, who, questioned about what he would have changed in the past five years with the benefit of hindsight, admitted: \"We almost certainly would have made a different decision about the dome.\" Yesterday, the spectre of the dome returned to haunt the party after the Today programme claimed that accountancy firm Deloitte and Touche had warned the Millennium Commission its target of 12m visitors would be difficult to achieve and recommended a lower target of 8m. Yesterday the Millennium Commission was quick to deny the claims, with a spokesman insisting Deloitte and Touche had advised them the 12m target was \"achievable\", while 8m was a \"worst-case scenario\". After the debate, Lord Falconer said he had no information about the reports. But, at the debate, the outspoken backbencher, Robert Marshall-Andrews, brought the subject to the fore when he suggested the dome typified the government's \"arrogance\" since decisions about its funding were made by an \"unelected, unaccountable committee.\" He added: \"As long as these kind of mechanics exist people will believe the political process is being treated with contempt.\" The MP for Medway suggested that the reason for the government's unpopularity was not its refusal to cut fuel taxes, and not even in its stance on pensions, but its \"contempt for democracy and the corruption of politics.\" He attacked the prime minister for only attending 4% of Commons votes. The contentious issue of the London mayor Ken Livingstone was also brought up at the debate, when one delegate suggested he should be readmitted into the party despite standing against Frank Dobson, Labour's candidate. Mr Smith said it was probable \"in due course\", but reminded delegates: \"This is someone who has stood against and defeated a Labour party candidate and that is not something to be dismissed lightly.\" But Alan Simpson, MP for Nottingham South, insisted: \"If we can vote Paddy Ashdown into the cabinet, we can have Ken Livingstone in the party.\"",

Police found the youngster unharmed with Wong and three other men in a car in Barking. They also found a 56lb weight, rope and plastic cable, the court heard. But Wong said he was not in volved in snatching the boy and only discovered that he was being held when he visited a friend in Barking. He said he intended to take the boy home. Wong told police: \"They were going to tie the boy up with the weight on his foot so that he could not run away.\" Wong admitted that a month earlier the group had \"jokingly\" talked of snatching the boy. Three other Malaysian men - Chon-Kiong Hong, 29, of no fixed address, Vui-Tshung Thien, 23, of Barking, and his brother, Vui-Kiun Thien, 29, of no fixed address - have admitted false imprisonment and blackmail. The trial continues.",

      "bodyText": "A British student who disappeared in Bolivia for more than three weeks during a solo jungle trek escaped with his life after being thrown over a waterfall, sucked into a whirlpool and trapped on a cliff ledge until his rations ran out. Luke Dance was yesterday recovering in hospital in the capital La Paz. Last night his father, Michael, 48, who was reunited with his son at the British embassy, told of a catalogue of misfortune which saw the Loughborough University student lose two stone and suffer leg injuries. Problems for the 19-year-old, from Crawley, West Sussex, began soon after he started a solo trek in the Yungas, a region of lush sub-tropical valleys in Bolivia which is known for its spectacular trekking. \"He ended up on the wrong path and lost his footing in the mud,\" his father explained. \"The weight of his backpack took him over the side and he fell into a river - about a 12ft drop.

He said he couldn't manage to climb back up and it just took him that long to find his way back to civilisation.\" Concern for Mr Dance first arose when he failed to meet up with friends from the East Midlands Universities Officer Training Corps in Lima, the Peruvian capital, after his trek. He had been due to fly back to Britain with them on September 15. Mr Dance, who plans to join the Royal Engineers on graduation in 2002, had contacted his family from an internet cafe in La Paz on August 29, two days before leaving his friends and setting off on his trek. He told his father he intended to travel alone for the last leg of his eight-week trip. His father, a manager with the gas company BOC, flew to Bolivia with 500 posters of his missing son on Saturday while a website appeal was set up from Britain. Mr Dance, a management science student, had already felt a number of adrenaline rushes on his Latin American travels - bungee jumping 1,200ft from a hot air balloon, white-water rafting and climbing a 18,000ft mountain. Foreign Office advice to those travelling in Bolivia is to \"be vigilant at all times\". \"Recent incidents in La Paz have reflected a trend towards aggressive crimes against foreigners,\" it said. \"Visitors travelling alone overland are especially vulnerable and are advised to be extremely vigilant.\"",

A team of scientists in Germany found that disposable nappies prevented the natural cooling mechanism in the testes of male babies and toddlers from functioning properly. They argued, in a paper in the journal Archives of Disease in Childhood, that the rise in temperature of the testes could damage the development of sperm in the long term and possibly make cancer more likely. The study was immediately attacked by nappy manufacturers. Peter Stephenson, director general of the Absorbent Hygiene Products Manufacturers Association, said: \"We believe the study is scientifically flawed and unsound. The conclusions are irresponsible, inappropriate and unreliable.\" Some studies of male fertility suggested that it began to fall before the second world war, when disposable nappies had not been invented, he said. The paper would cause \"unnecessary alarm for parents\". The authors of the disputed paper, Wolfgang Sippell and colleagues from the department of paediatrics at the University of Kiel, pointed out that previous studies had shown a decline in the quality of human sperm. Environmental changes, such as increased use of hormone-disrupting chemicals, have been blamed, but heating of the scrotum, through tight-fitting underwear, sedentary jobs and the effects of saunas have also been implicated. The German researchers used tiny temperature monitors located within 48 babies' and toddlers nappies to assess whether the disposable, plastic-lined variety which are now in common use affected temperature more than traditional cotton nappies. The children ranged in age from five premature babies to a boy of four and a half years old. The children wore disposable nappies for one period of 24 hours and cotton nappies for a second day and night. The monitors recorded their scrotal temperature, which has been shown to be reasonably similar to testicular temperature, every 30 seconds. When they wore the disposable nappies, scrotal temperatures were significantly higher - up to 1C higher than in cotton nappies - with the highest temperatures recorded in the youngest babies. Rectal temperatures were, as would be expected, higher than scrotal temperatures, but in 13 babies, there was no difference - which meant, said the authors, that the normal testicular cooling mechanism had failed completely. They said that more work was needed to prove or disprove their hypothesis. Disposable nappies were introduced 25 years ago. They suggested studying the fertility of men in west Germany whose parents had access to them, and those in east Germany, whose parents did not.

      "body": "<p>The Labour party spent most of yesterday talking to itself. This isn't usually an advisable activity for a political party. The collective celebration of triumph is always disastrous, as may well be shown at Bournemouth next week, when the Conservatives nourish each other's passing delusions of grandeur regardless of the world outside. But for Labour in Brighton, it was a necessary exercise. The party has suffered an unimaginable shock. It was in trauma. It doesn't know what happened. It needed reassurance that the world isn't about to come to an end.</p> <p>Its bewilderment is justified. I haven't spoken to a single soul who really claims to understand why public opinion stands where it seems to at this moment. That goes for Tory as well as Labour people whose job it is to know. The job is harder because the switch in the polls, though fast and wide, does not seem to be deep. It's difficult for anyone to believe that the voters have made a settled decision to jettison the Labour government. No sea-change is apparent, only a sudden redirection of the swirling shallows. Yet this doesn't diminish the fear, never far below the surface of old Labour psyches, that the tide may turn against them.</p> <p>The leadership's response yesterday was unambiguous. It steadied the ship by insisting it would not change direction. It summoned the party to keep its nerve, reminding it of why it came to power in the first place. Called on to repent of its famous arrogance, it made no apology for anything it had done. The reassurance it offered was to lead and not to bend. The recent fashion has been to present it with the choice between listening and leading: is this a focus group or a principle that I see before me? Its answer to the party was surprisingly categoric. It will listen, but is quite determined not to become as fickle or frenetic as the public in the world outside.</p> <p>After all, it is the governing party. Ministers are still doing big things that transcend the froth and gossip that unwary newspaper readers might imagine to be the alpha and omega of the government's existence. They're about more than spin and headlines. That was the message. By mid-afternoon it had proved to be the correct strategic choice. Trauma had absorbed its therapy, and vanished.</p> <p>The first message came, as if to emphasise its novelty, from Peter Mandelson. The man commonly cast as the ace of spinners, the source of all bitching, made a serious speech about Northern Ireland. At first the response was tepid. Mr Mandelson has never been a favourite at even the most laundered of New Labour conferences. But slowly they warmed to him. Here was a minister presiding over important business, laying into the forces of bigotry who would overturn it, delivering something the Tories could never do. Though there was no danger of a standing ovation, the extended applause signalled the looming of reassurance.</p> <p>Next up was John Prescott. Again the story was all about delivery, beginning with the delivery of a speech containing more sentences that parsed than Mr Prescott has ever given. Within his impossibly spacious brief, there was nothing the deputy prime minister wasn't delivering, and he reeled off lists of achievement that most of the party had long forgotten - if, indeed, they had ever been fully aware of them. Mr Prescott was listening - but mainly to the massive applause he got for a rededication to the fight against fox-hunting. The Countryside Alliance, the petrol blockaders and all other forces of conservatism were told not to mess with a Labour government.

      "bodyText": "The Labour party spent most of yesterday talking to itself. This isn't usually an advisable activity for a political party. The collective celebration of triumph is always disastrous, as may well be shown at Bournemouth next week, when the Conservatives nourish each other's passing delusions of grandeur regardless of the world outside. But for Labour in Brighton, it was a necessary exercise. The party has suffered an unimaginable shock. It was in trauma. It doesn't know what happened. It needed reassurance that the world isn't about to come to an end. Its bewilderment is justified. I haven't spoken to a single soul who really claims to understand why public opinion stands where it seems to at this moment. That goes for Tory as well as Labour people whose job it is to know. The job is harder because the switch in the polls, though fast and wide, does not seem to be deep. It's difficult for anyone to believe that the voters have made a settled decision to jettison the Labour government. No sea-change is apparent, only a sudden redirection of the swirling shallows. Yet this doesn't diminish the fear, never far below the surface of old Labour psyches, that the tide may turn against them. The leadership's response yesterday was unambiguous. It steadied the ship by insisting it would not change direction. It summoned the party to keep its nerve, reminding it of why it came to power in the first place. Called on to repent of its famous arrogance, it made no apology for anything it had done. The reassurance it offered was to lead and not to bend. The recent fashion has been to present it with the choice between listening and leading: is this a focus group or a principle that I see before me? Its answer to the party was surprisingly categoric. It will listen, but is quite determined not to become as fickle or frenetic as the public in the world outside. After all, it is the governing party. Ministers are still doing big things that transcend the froth and gossip that unwary newspaper readers might imagine to be the alpha and omega of the government's existence. They're about more than spin and headlines. That was the message. By mid-afternoon it had proved to be the correct strategic choice. Trauma had absorbed its therapy, and vanished. The first message came, as if to emphasise its novelty, from Peter Mandelson. The man commonly cast as the ace of spinners, the source of all bitching, made a serious speech about Northern Ireland. At first the response was tepid. Mr Mandelson has never been a favourite at even the most laundered of New Labour conferences. But slowly they warmed to him. Here was a minister presiding over important business, laying into the forces of bigotry who would overturn it, delivering something the Tories could never do. Though there was no danger of a standing ovation, the extended applause signalled the looming of reassurance. Next up was John Prescott. Again the story was all about delivery, beginning with the delivery of a speech containing more sentences that parsed than Mr Prescott has ever given. Within his impossibly spacious brief, there was nothing the deputy prime minister wasn't delivering, and he reeled off lists of achievement that most of the party had long forgotten - if, indeed, they had ever been fully aware of them. Mr Prescott was listening - but mainly to the massive applause he got for a rededication to the fight against fox-hunting. The Countryside Alliance, the petrol blockaders and all other forces of conservatism were told not to mess with a Labour government. You could hear relief settling over a lot of rattled people. Yet these ministers were but the prelude. Gordon Brown arrived from Prague, with a speed that shows how things have changed in a quarter of a century. In 1976, Denis Healey abandoned the International Monetary Fund to come and treat in desperation with the Labour party. This year, Mr Brown favours the Labour party with a mere 12 hours before returning to the IMF. He didn't waste his moment. His speech registered a disdain for the party's petty tribulations which the party was only too delighted to hear.

He was at his most seigneurial, vowing to listen, but implying there was no conceivable contradiction between this performance and the unflinching pursuit of his objectives.

      "bodyText": "Wireless internet group iTouch defied the cynics yesterday with a 56% increase in revenues in the second quarter of the year . The business, which is controlled by Tony O'Reilly's Independent News &amp; Media, provides content and services to mobile phone customers through short messaging and Wap. Group revenues were a shade under \u00a31.3m, with pre-tax losses for the period widening to \u00a31.8m. The company said the rate of revenue growth was likely to continue in the second half of the year. ITouch shares climbed more than 5% to 67.5p, al though they are still trading below their 70p offer price when the company was floated last month. Chairman Ivan Fallon, above, said growth had been strongest in the corporate sector, with new clients including BAT and BMW. The fastest growing part of the business is short messaging services, which showed a 150% rise in revenues. ITouch opened its Wap portal in Britain in June, with the most popular sites so far proving to be real-time share prices, news, market indicators, currencies and sport.

I remember it looked beautiful and the team kept saying they were exhilarated. I am now more familiar with African politics and know the names (and some of the telephone numbers) of the area's leaders.</p> <p>David is a television producer- director. He spent most of last year making a series for Channel 4 about the hairdressing chain, Vidal Sassoon. Early this summer, tired of bobs and shampoo, he accepted a job to make a film about Liberia and its government. He was thrilled to have the chance to go to Africa and tell a big international story.</p> <p>We spoke several times after he arrived. He told me that filming was difficult and access to President Charles Taylor was being denied, although he had agreed to be interviewed. I began to feel really uncomfortable and my two small boys and I started to count the \"sleeps\" left before David would be home.</p> <p>Then I got the call. It was about 9.30pm on Friday August 18. On television, Friends had just finished. I never got to see Frasier. David said his room had been searched and his tapes had been seized but he was OK. There was nothing to worry about. He was on schedule to leave on Sunday and would be home by Monday. But there was something in his voice that I didn't recognise at first. Fear.</p> <p>Next day, at lunchtime, David's executive producer called to tell me that my husband had been arrested and had spent the night in a police cell. This couldn't be happening. The idea that the sweetest, most innocent man in the world, whose only brush with the law was being drunk in charge of a moped as a student, could be banged up in a Liberian cell was beyond belief.</p> <p>I rang round friends and family. My father-in-law came round and occupied the boys while I tried to get more information. I called a friend of ours, Roy Ackerman, a South African-born television executive who said he would call his uncle, who knew Nelson Mandela. It sounded like a long shot. Friends started to turn up at the house and a campaign committee formed in my kitchen. We started to lobby the Foreign Office, the United Nations and the World Bank. But by the end of the first day, I knew little other than David was still being detained. I felt utterly powerless.</p> <p>Somehow, I slept for about five hours. At 6am, I called the production company that had hired David and screamed at the executive producer, whom I had woken. We had a very animated conversation. He was tense and tired and told me to stop \"crapping on his head\"; he didn't have any more news. At 7am, the Liberian story was the third item on the Radio 4 news. My husband was named. I unplugged the radio and television, preferring news from the ground. At 9am, my sister took my boys to Legoland. I hadn't told them anything. I wanted to keep them in their happy summer-of-fun bubble.</p> <p>Then my world went mad. I received a call from the Foreign Office telling me that next day David would be charged with espionage and sent to prison.</p> <p>By lunchtime on Sunday, reality had taken on a whole new look. Nelson Mandela had telephoned President Taylor and asked for the four to be released. This was unbelievable - but there was more to come. Jesse Jackson, the US special African envoy, went live on CNN to plead for David's release. There I was, chain-smoking in the garden of my north London house, and there was Jackson, one of the most influential politicians on the planet, talking on what is arguably the most politically influential television channel on the planet, about my husband and the wellbeing of his family.</p> <p>Shortly after his appearance on CNN, I was asked by Jackson's office if I would like to give the special envoy a statement or ask any questions. I had five minutes to think about it. We scratched our heads. \"What about getting him to sort out your resident's parking?\" my father-in-law suggested. Once the nervous laughter died, we dictated a few lines about David, his innocence and his credibility as a film-maker.</p> <p>I received another call from the Foreign Office, this time asking me to dictate a message that the European consul in Liberia would be able to pass to David. I told him I was strong and fighting, I told him the boys were fine and in Legoland.</p> <p>The next day, things deteriorated. \"The Liberian Four\", as the media had named them, were charged and sent to prison. There was talk of a trial in November. I was reassured that the four men were together, separated from other prisoners and in good spirits. The prison was \"really clean, for Africa\".</p> <p>Tim Gardam, the director of programmes at Channel 4, called me. In television mythology, this man is a god and people like me don't get to talk to him, let alone shout expletives at him. He was sympathetic and deeply upset. But I still shouted at him: \"He's my love, he's my life, you've got to get him home.\"</p> <p>My house had turned into a 24- hour drop-in centre for concerned friends and family who comforted, humoured and organised a running buffet of mixed delicacies - pork pies, doughnuts and caviar, all the things people know I love. I couldn't swallow any of it. But boy, could I smoke.</p> <p>During a late night think-in, our friend Roy came up with the name George Weah - a Manchester City footballer and, apparently, the most famous Liberian in the world. It took me a while to get the power of the footie thing. The influence Beckham would have on Tony Blair, Roy assured me, was not a good comparison.</p> <p>Then came the Colonel Gadafy connection. A friend in the US had spoken to former president Jimmy Carter who suggested, bizarrely, that I fly to Libya and meet the colonel. Gadafy is apparently close to Taylor and happy to help out in difficult international situations. He would appreciate a personal visit from a wife, I was told. But how could I leave my children?</p> <p>Wednesday was grim. I got a call saying David had been beaten up. I cracked. I was sick. More calls were made to Mandela and Jackson. A few hours later, Gardam called to say that David hadn't been beaten up. He had been psychologically abused. We agreed to meet the following day.</p> <p>I took Roy, my sister and my father-in-law with me. We had a brief, but vivid, meeting at Channel 4 and then went to the Foreign Office where our moods were soon lifted. We met James Watt, the head of the consular division. Things, he assured us, were happening. The chairman of Channel 4 had written to Taylor apologising for any action the crew might have taken to cause offence, and undertook not to continue with the film. The four men had also apologised to the Liberian government. The British ambassador to the Ivory Coast was in Monrovia, holding meetings with the Liberian justice minister.</p> <p>By Friday, mercifully, the combination of apology, international pressure and diplomacy secured the men's release - so I never got to take tea with Gadafy in his tent. The men were flown from Monrovia to the Ivory Coast. David rang me at about 9.30pm - the most welcome phone call I have ever received. But it also threw another episode of Frasier down the tubes.</p>",

You go to pleasant restaurants and drink fine wine with your pleasant friends. You have no terminal health problems, no danger lurking in your DNA, no mad relatives locked in attics. You should be happy. You're not. </p> <p>At least you're not as happy as you should be, someone in your position, and the reason is as mysterious to you as a self-assessment tax return form. You think about walking in front of buses, spitting at people at parties and crushing up 21 paracetamol with your Jamie Oliver-esque pestle and mortar and dissolving them in a bottle of Chablis. You could continue as you are in your nice life, trying not to notice how unfulfilled you are, or you could take the Chablis and liver failure route (quick) or you could get a couple of badly drawn tattoos, drink cider and wish your life away watching Trisha (slow). Or you could do something completely different. You could seek self-fulfilment in Las Vegas. </p> <p>It sounds like a last-ditch attempt, but shouting \"I am fantastic!\" several times in a moving vehicle is the first step to achieving everything you want to, being who you want to be. The first in a new series of <strong> Louis Theroux's Weird Weekends</strong> (BBC2) saw the cheeky, geeky one in Las Vegas seeking out self-fulfilment with the help of hypnotists. It was a joy. </p> <p>First off was Dennis Lowry, director of the American Academy of Hypnosis. His powers were so awesome, he had managed to hypnotise a caterpillar to lie along his upper lip. (Either that or he had a very bad moustache, the kind normally sported by men who ask children in the park if they want to see some puppies.) Dennis told Louis that the mind is a powerful thing which, if it's harnessed in the correct way, can work miracles. To prove his point, Dennis hypnotised an arthritic dog. </p> <p>The credentials of Ross, an advocate of the \"speed seduction\" technique, were more suspect. He had bought an $800 quilt tree for his cat's Christmas. Incredibly, he wasn't gay. Even more incredibly, he was actually successful with women, thanks to his technique which involved going up to women in coffee houses and at supermarkets and asking them what their favourite constellation was. Ross doesn't go to bars, because women go to such places to reject men and get free drinks (but surely not in that order). </p> <p>Louis was less successful when he tried Ross's MO. \"Compliment, introduction, question,\" Ross sighed, as women ignored Louis on the street. Despite his \"I am confident\" mantra, Louis looked like the last schoolboy to get picked up at the school gate. You can understand why a lady called Sydney eventually took pity on him and gave him her mobile phone number. </p> <p>Last on Louis' list for hypnotic help with self-improvement was the doyen of such things, Marshall Sylver. He had very odd hair, which might have been a fleet of caterpillars, all entranced to lie perfectly still atop his head. Marshall had made millions hypnotising people. Not, as you might think, with the \"When you wake up, you will give me all your money\" approach, but by helping them believe in themselves. He could even make people into millionaires with the power of positive thinking. Louis was too sceptical to be made a millionaire. He had no \"mustard seed of faith\". </p> <p>In Marshall's world, you don't say \"No problem\", you say \"No challenge!\" If you're diagnosed with cancer, you feel \"awesome\". His associates quote Yoda and his buzzwords are Passion, Power, Profit. He speaks in capital letters and exclamation marks. It was hard not to dislike Marshall. Especially when he hypnotised a woman, then stood on her. She would have woken up and found footprints on her back but been unable to explain them. Hardly the actions of a nice man. </p> <p>In his wonderfully understated, deceptively dippy way, Louis exposed these ridiculous men and their practices, summing up poetically: \"Would I rather have the truth or a lie that gave me hope? I'd rather have the truth.\" </p> <p>As Dennis, Ross and Marshall participated in their own character assassinations - victims with no one to blame but themselves - the gentle genius of Louis Theroux was illuminated. His gift is the gentle ribbing. Extra sensation, don't you know.</p>",

A lot of men (I can't believe I'm saying this, it's so obvious) assume one thing for the woman and another for them. On a non-Olympic everyday domestic level, many believe, for example, that their Tuesday night training or Saturday afternoon spectating is as important as getting the food into the house, keeping the bedding clean or fixing a broken tap.

He, the innocent man, who slogs all week and who deserves his bit of relaxation, is being Got At by this harridan who wants to spoil his fun. \"She was never going to stop me from doing what I wanted to do,\" Redgrave said on another occasion. I bet she never wanted to. I bet she just wanted to see him sometimes.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in an ordinary family, when the woman says: \"I want to go to t'ai chi on Tuesday night\" he says: \"Tuesday night?

Women are usually in charge of family arrangements: they have far more opportunity to get things done how they want.</p> <p>Of course nothing great is achieved without sacrifice. And it's desperate to issue an ultimatum. It isn't usually to do with gold medals, but anyway, how many gold medals does one man need?

      "body": "<p>There are a million stories in the naked city, and more than 400 of them are on display at London's Institute of Contemporary Arts. The paintings are awful, indefensible, crapulous. They are inept, stomach-turning and banal. These people can't draw, can't paint; these people should never be left alone with a paintbrush. Each has a story to tell, but I'm not sure I want to hear it. </p> <p>My eye skids the wall, and the paintings hung salon-style, several deep: lonely reindeer in the woods, rutting bison with the hump, a hairy arm emerging from a grave. Cosmic surfers, pyramids with flying saucers overhead, Led Zeppelin lyrics painted in flower-power squidgy script. Campbell soup cans, in homage to Warhol, with three green apples on a plate. I fill my notebook, page after page. Is it a palette or a picture? Is it a painting or a tray of globby mucus? AAARGH! Here comes the inept finger, pointing at the void. And more hands, grasping at the world in space, as though to illustrate the alleged last words of the Boston Strangler: \"I wish the whole world had one neck and I had my hands around it.\" What to make of dribbly man with sub-Philip Guston finger looking at hard-edged abstract boy in the corner with his hair on fire? There are things in the sky; they're not birds, but monstrous apparitions of the id. If they are birds, as perhaps the painter intended, I don't want to meet him, ever. </p> <p>Jim Shaw's Thrift Store Paintings, a voluminous collection of junk shop, garage sale and swap group acquisitions, has been doing the rounds in the US and Europe for almost a decade. The often anonymous artists - none of them, so far as anyone is aware, ever joined the stable of a serious art gallery anywhere - are doubtless unaware of their notoriety. They know not the mirth they bring, the looks of alarm. Not for them the promiscuous fame of the open studio weekend or the Royal Academy summer exhibition, or its US equivalent. Not for them, even, the walls of friends, if they have any, because their efforts ended up junked, till Shaw came to their rescue. </p> <p>I remind myself that these painters - those, that is, who are not gibbering on street corners or held in snakepit back-wards administered by Nurse Ratched, or doing their master's degrees on Death Row - have the vote in the Land of the Free. These are some of the worst paintings you will ever see, and more than a few are patently out of synch with the world. But they've got something. I've been here two hours already and time has flown, or it did until I saw those birds, bodies like parasitic grubs, hawking through a lurid sky. </p> <p>Shaw is not alone. He started collecting these works in the 1970s, never paying more than $5. Now there is quite a fad, in Europe and the US, and prices have risen with demand. But he won't spend more than 35 bucks a shot. This isn't Outsider Art, in the sense of the compulsive and relentless outpouring of private obsession, which often has a haunting beauty. This isn't the Art Brut collected by Dubuffet, or idiot savant art, or even simple untutored guile. Shaw has a good eye for the bad, the disturbing moment, the ineptitude that gives these works their inadvertent twist, their humour and their horror. Some of it is just folksy and charming, or strains to be surreal, or represents the misconstrued modern - like those abstract pictures in cartoon interiors, with Mr Magoo tripping and flailing in the foreground. </p> <p>There are pipe-smoking Bing Crosby types lingering over the Saturday Evening Post, women in crinolines, but also naked ladies with minx expressions sitting on the toilet, lots of 1950s nudes with piled-up hair and cigarette holders, and the wives of four ex-presidents, naked, showing us their gynaecology. Mrs Ford, Pat Nixon, Nancy Reagan and Mrs Carter (or possibly Mrs Bush, though I hesitate to say the name), smiling their publicity-shot smiles, unafraid and unashamed, not a fold in the labia undetailed. These grisly paintings must have taken weeks. That sexual fantasy (and possibly a desire to amuse the painter's friends) should go so far is unsurprising, unexceptional in intent, and inevitably distasteful. You realise that a grown man did this, and painted innocuous scenes on the reverse of the paintings, so they could be hung on the wall of the den. Maybe he turned them round on poker nights, to show off his hot First Lady fantasies. Like a lot of the things here, you wonder about the psyche of the painter - surely a he - and what he was like. Probably the regular neighbour, small-town bank teller, retired CIA man with a hobby, local congressman dreaming the American Wet Dream. </p> <p> A hint of prurience creeps in here: if Shaw's collection is about more than oddball failed art, then it is about these unknowable Americans and their deluded aspirations and fantasies. It comes in tandem with their essential failure as artists. You might laugh, but some of the time you'll be appalled by the suspicion that some of what we see reflects serious fixations. What to make of a painting of a wan unhappy child in the gloom, big male hands coming to cradle it, all floating above a piece of half-eaten strawberry cake, a smouldering cigarette still burning in the cream? The fact that the painting is so meticulous in execution makes it even worse. </p> <p>Whatever glimpses of darkness these pictures show, they often also prove the simple truth that ineptitude can be expressive. The painting Three Street Lights - three yellow blobs in the urban murk - is almost worthy of Albert Pinkham Ryder, updated to Edward Hopper's century. Two Shoes with Faces is a sort of cheesy Picabia, and Man With No Crotch Sits Down with Girl (Shaw's terse titles or descriptions say it all), with its Matissean mullions, her Botero arms, his TV sitcom smile, is a charming and hilarious painting. There's nothing wrong with charm, and the painting's shortfalls make it so much better than it ought to be. Look out too for Distorted Woman in Western Clothes with Grid, and Nude, Deer Head, Many Women and Dotted Line. (Are you sure that's not a David Salle that got in here by accident? No: it's too interesting and obsessive.) </p> <p>Shaw's project has paralleled his own development as an artist, swimming against the tide of buttoned-down, anti-visual, West Coast Cal-Arts conceptualism. His work at times has attempted the naiveties, the desperations and the evocativeness of the Thrift Store Paintings; it has done so in the recognition that you can't pretend to be an innocent. As I write, there is a fashion for knowingly painting in such a clunking style, as though strained imagery, anally retentive brushwork, wonky drawing and geeky subjects constitute a style like any other. Let's not forget, however, that the Dirty Realists knew how to write, and that however inarticulate the characters in a Raymond Carver story, the writing itself was honed and clear. You can't fake these things. There's bad bad art and there's good bad art, for all kinds of different reasons. </p> <p>Just as Shaw sees his own work as a kind of narrative, he told the curator of the ICA show, Matthew Higgs, that he regards the Thrift Store Paintings as an \"ongoing narrative about America\", and compares the collection to a folk music archive. He orders it all, grouping the works in categories - Beefcake and Cheesecakes, Psycho, Modern Art, Teenage Fantasy and so on. It is a catalogue of individual obsessions and overarching themes: religion and sin, sex, violence, nature, science fiction, hopes and nightmares. More than just a lexicon of failures, it does indeed tell us something about America and Americans. As with other West Coast artists of his generation - principally Paul McCarthy and Mike Kelley (whose work is one of the best things in Apocalypse at the Royal Academy), Shaw's interest in low culture is more than slumming it.

      "body": "<p>Few people in the west have spent more time with Slobodan Milosevic than Richard Holbrooke, currently the US ambassador at the United Nations. Holbrooke's autobiography even has an index entry for \"Milosevic: charm of\". There are six separate page-references. On his first encounter with the Yugoslav president, the word is that Milosevic was \"smart, charming, and evasive\". On another occasion we read of Milosevic being \"at his most charming, lighting up a huge Monte Cristo cigar\". The climax to this adulation came at a hunting lodge outside Belgrade where, over copious amounts of alcohol, the Americans were negotiating Bosnia's future. One of Holbrooke's team described the 12-hour session with the Serbian leader as \"bonding with the godfather\".</p> <p>Evil strongmen have always exercised an inordinate fascination on those who deal with them, particularly on foreigners who cannot fully understand their culture and are safe from their clutches. Holbrooke is no fool as a negotiator and - certainly for a man who has long hoped to be secretary of state in a Gore administration - he is not unguarded enough in his autobiography to suggest he made any concessions to Milosevic. But it was Holbrooke who personified more than any other diplomat the west's willingness to do business with Milosevic, first over Croatia, then Bosnia and finally Kosovo.</p> <p>Holbrooke and the west continued to hope for a face-saving deal until the last moment, before Milosevic's intransigence made intervention in Kosovo inevitable in March last year. When the international criminal tribunal in the Hague indicted Milosevic for war crimes two months later, in full conformity with the west's new view of the man they had accepted as a legitimate partner for so long, western governments were relieved. Now their fragile consciences had the crutch of an externally imposed defence against future temptation. However much they might secretly crave one last chance to sup with him, they knew Milosevic was no longer a fit companion.</p> <p>On Sunday Serbian voters came to the same conclusion. The enormity of their choice has surprised everyone, including the man they have rejected. It may yet be that he still claims victory. Alternatively, he may admit he lost this round and throw the election into a run-off in two weeks' time - with the hope of splitting the opposition through threats or bribes or, if that fails, organising a better ballot-rigging exercise in the next round.</p> <p>For the moment two things stand out. For the first time in over a decade Milosevic has lost the initiative. Instead of being three moves ahead of every other player, whether they be envoys of foreign powers or his domestic critics, he is on the back foot, desperately playing for time and looking for manoeuvres to escape. This new role will do wonders for the silent opposition within his own ranks. Dictators thrive on their image of invincibility. Once the colossus begins to wobble, the henchmen start to look for their own way out. Secret contacts with the opposition may have begun already. They are certain to grow over the coming days.</p> <p>The second conclusion is that, however the final count goes, Milosevic has been repudiated by the most important section of the Serbian electorate. The younger generation, urban voters, the better educated, and those Serbs who have the closest contact with the huge diaspora of Serbs abroad, many of whom are refugees from the Milosevic years, turned out against him.

      "bodyText": "Few people in the west have spent more time with Slobodan Milosevic than Richard Holbrooke, currently the US ambassador at the United Nations. Holbrooke's autobiography even has an index entry for \"Milosevic: charm of\". There are six separate page-references. On his first encounter with the Yugoslav president, the word is that Milosevic was \"smart, charming, and evasive\". On another occasion we read of Milosevic being \"at his most charming, lighting up a huge Monte Cristo cigar\". The climax to this adulation came at a hunting lodge outside Belgrade where, over copious amounts of alcohol, the Americans were negotiating Bosnia's future. One of Holbrooke's team described the 12-hour session with the Serbian leader as \"bonding with the godfather\". Evil strongmen have always exercised an inordinate fascination on those who deal with them, particularly on foreigners who cannot fully understand their culture and are safe from their clutches. Holbrooke is no fool as a negotiator and - certainly for a man who has long hoped to be secretary of state in a Gore administration - he is not unguarded enough in his autobiography to suggest he made any concessions to Milosevic. But it was Holbrooke who personified more than any other diplomat the west's willingness to do business with Milosevic, first over Croatia, then Bosnia and finally Kosovo. Holbrooke and the west continued to hope for a face-saving deal until the last moment, before Milosevic's intransigence made intervention in Kosovo inevitable in March last year. When the international criminal tribunal in the Hague indicted Milosevic for war crimes two months later, in full conformity with the west's new view of the man they had accepted as a legitimate partner for so long, western governments were relieved. Now their fragile consciences had the crutch of an externally imposed defence against future temptation. However much they might secretly crave one last chance to sup with him, they knew Milosevic was no longer a fit companion. On Sunday Serbian voters came to the same conclusion. The enormity of their choice has surprised everyone, including the man they have rejected. It may yet be that he still claims victory. Alternatively, he may admit he lost this round and throw the election into a run-off in two weeks' time - with the hope of splitting the opposition through threats or bribes or, if that fails, organising a better ballot-rigging exercise in the next round. For the moment two things stand out. For the first time in over a decade Milosevic has lost the initiative. Instead of being three moves ahead of every other player, whether they be envoys of foreign powers or his domestic critics, he is on the back foot, desperately playing for time and looking for manoeuvres to escape. This new role will do wonders for the silent opposition within his own ranks. Dictators thrive on their image of invincibility. Once the colossus begins to wobble, the henchmen start to look for their own way out. Secret contacts with the opposition may have begun already. They are certain to grow over the coming days. The second conclusion is that, however the final count goes, Milosevic has been repudiated by the most important section of the Serbian electorate. The younger generation, urban voters, the better educated, and those Serbs who have the closest contact with the huge diaspora of Serbs abroad, many of whom are refugees from the Milosevic years, turned out against him. They too now see he is a man with whom no legitimate business can be done. They understand that more Milosevic means more penury and more isolation. It is a change of historic proportions. In world terms Milosevic's defeat sends an encouraging signal. Those who come to power by the sword usually perish by the sword.

No, you simply saw the film starring Cate Blanchett on Channel 4 a couple of Sundays ago. Ah, right, yes. Are they planning a sequel? Nope, a book. Great! You mean one of those \"book of the movie\" paperbacks, with lots of behind-the-scenes photos and a dramatic change in ending? No, I mean Elizabeth I, CEO by Dr Alan Axelrod. CEO? Yes, Axelrod claims that Queenie is a brilliant role model for chief execs everywhere. Of course. Strange that no one has noticed this before. Isn't it just. But what with her \"personal dynamism\" and her role as an \"effective coach and mentor\" it was only a matter of time. Axelrod tells us that \"she both led and managed England as a brilliant executive runs a great corporation\". Only probably with fewer flip-charts. And not as many focus groups. Actually, Elizabeth's reduction of the privy council and her assembly of trusty advisers could possibly be seen as an early form of focus grouping... Hmm, just as her father could be seen as the king of executive reshuffling? Well, she was probably a smidgen better at people management than Henry VIII. So she's the new office pin-up? The suits just love the way she managed \"one of the most dramatic corporate turnarounds ever seen\", and succeeded in \"growing the enterprise and crushing the opposition\". Whatever that may mean. Not to be confused with: The Virgin King, Richard Branson.",

He was frozen out by fellow Tory MPs. By 1958, Johnson had ceased to be a Tory and decided not to stand again for parliament. Instead, he tried to move the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals off the fence on fox-hunting - and was expelled for \"conduct prejudicial to the interests of the society\". Then in 1963, as vice-president of the League Against Cruel Sports, he urged members to squat in the roads, risking death at the hands of riders. \"If they kill you, they will stand a very fine chance of hanging or imprisonment,\" he said. In 1964, Johnson sought to re-enter parliament, rejoining the Tories and fruitlessly urging his old constituency party to select him again. His zigzags continued into old age, when he joined CND, opposed the Brighton bypass, and, by the 1980s, supported Labour. He continued as a local solicitor, and a director of the Alliance Building Society (later the Alliance and Leicester), in retirement on the Isle of Man. He outlived his second wife, Betty, and his son by his first wife. \u0095 Howard Sydney Johnson, politician, born December 25 1910; died September 13 2000",

Campaigning in Florida, Mr Gore unveiled a 74-page booklet explaining how he proposes to deal with the crisis facing Medicare, the state-funded health system for pensioners, which is emerging as one of the key policy battlegrounds of the presidential elections. A Gallup poll published yesterday showed Mr Bush ahead of the vice president by 47 per cent to 46 per cent.

The London fashion week venue was unusual, a former church turned sports hall on a trading estate in west London, but it was packed to the rafters with the cream of the fashion crowd, and they did not leave disappointed. Building on the success of last season, his collection had the usual Lupfer trademarks, supple leathers and bold graphics, but the overriding difference was a giant leap in confidence. With a tight colour palette of black, cream, green, lilac and blue, he tipped his shallow brimmed trilby in a Mod direction once again. Masculine leather jackets (with all important shoved-up sleeves) were worn with micro minis and mid-calf colourful boots. The key print was Prince of Wales check on a cream base with red or blue. The check was blown up for some bias cut silk dresses with draping cowl necks and floaty sleeves, and used in miniature on high button prim shirts matched with A-line skirts. In true Lupfer style the check was then juxtaposed with differently weighted fabrics. A check blouse was worn with a pastel blue leather skirt that had ribbons of leather hanging from the waistband; and check trousers were worn with a light black lace top swathed in black and white feathers. There was even a tribute to cowgirl - a check skirt studded with rhinestones. Lupfer kept the emphasis on the hips, a trend already in evidence on many other catwalks this season. Bands of smocking adorned the backs of jackets and the bottoms of blouses, cinching them at hip level.

      "bodyText": "France's political elite was reeling yesterday after the highly damaging allegations of kickbacks centred on the president, Jacques Chirac, spread to embroil a former Socialist finance minister and dragged in the name of the celebratedfashion designer, Karl Lagerfeld. Dominique Strauss-Kahn, a leading ministerial light until forced by graft allegations to resign from Lionel Jospin's cabinet last year, admitted that for nearly two years he had been sitting on potentially devastating corruption evidence against Mr Chirac. The disgraced former finance minister confirmed he had been given a now-infamous videotape last April in which Jean-Claude M\u00e9ry, a property developer and senior official in Mr Chirac's RPR party, directly implicated the president in a vast covert fundraising operation. M\u00e9ry recorded the tape before dying of cancer last year. His lawyer gave the cassette to Mr Strauss-Kahn - apparently in the hope that as finance minister he would arrange a massive tax break for another of the lawyer's clients, the couturier Karl Lagerfeld. Amid mounting suspicion in RPR ranks that the Socialist party was responsible for the release of the tape to French media last week, an embattled President Chirac immediately called for an investigation into \"the possible involvement of Mr Strauss-Kahn in this very serious matter\". After a morning crisis meeting the prime minister, Mr Jospin, promised to hold a swift inquiry and said the finance ministry would hand over all relevant documents to magistrates later in the day. Mr Jospin is anxious to prevent any further fallout on his ruling coalition. Mr Strauss-Kahn, a lawyer by training and a close friend of the prime minister, admitted he had received the original of the tape from M\u00e9ry's counsel, Alain Belot, but denied he had ever watched it and claimed he did not even know where it was. \"I knew Belot as a tax lawyer and because he had worked with the parliament's tax committee,\" Mr Strauss-Kahn told Le Monde. \"He gave me a tape and said: 'Have a look at that, it's interesting.'

Before his fall from grace, Mr Strauss-Kahn had been hotly tipped as the Socialist party's candidate for Paris mayor in next year's municipal election. The tape, detailing allegations of institutionalised RPR corruption at Paris town hall, would have been a powerful electoral asset. Mr Lagerfeld's fashion house declined all comment on the story, but according to French media the couturier was indeed the subject of a big tax investigation and faced a \u00a330m demand last year after it emerged he had not paid any tax in France for six years. One paper said that he eventually paid just \u00a35m, though there is no evidence that any special favour was granted by the authorities. Mr Strauss-Kahn rejected all allegations of wrongdoing. He told French radio that he denied \"all political connections that people are trying to make, as well as any connections with any tax dossier\" involving Mr Lagerfeld. The extraordinary tale of widespread corruption in high places began to emerge last week when Le Monde printed, in two consecutive issues over some six pages, the transcript of M\u00e9ry's tape, which the businessman recorded in 1996 \"in case anything happens to me\". He claimed that he was in charge of a many-tentacled system whereby construction companies paid big bribes to win maintenance, heating and other contracts for city-owned housing blocks while Mr Chirac was mayor of Paris. The vast majority of the money, he said, went to Mr Chirac's RPR. The allegations from beyond the grave, which dropped like a bombshell in Paris and were furiously denied by Mr Chirac, were the latest in a string of corruption accusations levelled against the president pertaining to the period from 1977 to 1995 when he was mayor.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Cable operators in India last night blacked out TV screens in almost 1m homes in protest at a new broadcasting law which holds them directly responsible for showing adult programmes, and for screening advertisements for beer and cigarettes.</p> <p>The operators say it is \"ridiculous\" to blame them for the contents of India's mostly mediocre 70 TV channels and claim it is the broadcasters who should be the target of government legislation.</p> <p>The strike, which is set to go on for three days, has so far only affected Delhi, completely wiping out coverage of the Olympics and all state-run channels.</p> <p>\"So far we have only hit Delhi. But unless the government wakes up soon and does something about the law the strike will spread to Bombay and across the country,\" Vikki Chowdhry, of the Cable TV Operators United Front said last night. \"We are not responsible for what is on TV. The government must scrap this lopsided legislation.\"</p> <p>There was confusion in gov ernment circles as to what, exactly, would fall foul of the new cable network act. By western standards, Indian TV is remarkably chaste with no full frontal nudity and not much kissing. The country's most risque channel is Fashion TV, which shows models gliding down the catwalk, while Indian actresses are required to do nothing more suggestive in Hindi movies than to gyrate in the obligatory wet sari scene.</p> <p>Under the new legislation cable operators will receive a warning if they are deemed to be transmitting obscene material. They then face arrest if they repeat the offence. Delhi's police chief Dr K K Paul, yesterday claimed that certain operators were flouting the rules by transmitting pornography in the early hours of the morning. \"If they are as clean as they say they are, then why are they going ahead with the strike?\" he asked.</p> <p>The law which came into effect two weeks ago has attracted the wrath of India's tobacco advertisers who say they spend only 1% of funds on TV ads. The industry claims that such adverts are shown at times when children are unlikely to be watching. The law's only immediate casualty appears to be adverts for Kingfisher, one of India's most popular beers, which have now been pulled.</p> <p>India's broadcasting minister, Arun Jaitley, has defended the new act, which comes amid wider moves to liberalise Indian TV, including a decision two months ago allowing foreign companies to broadcast to India via cable for the first time.</p> <p>\"We are a liberal society. We will ban cable operators only in the rarest of rare cases. Power to ban any channel is only with central government,\" Mr Jaitley insisted.</p> <p>But under the new, more stringent rules shows deemed to be adult, previously only broadcast between 11pm and6am, have been banned completely. \"All programmes will now have to be in conformity with the code prescribing norms of decency, morality and national security,\" a government spokesman said. An estimated 50m Indians own TV sets, with another 100m believed to have access to television.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Cable operators in India last night blacked out TV screens in almost 1m homes in protest at a new broadcasting law which holds them directly responsible for showing adult programmes, and for screening advertisements for beer and cigarettes. The operators say it is \"ridiculous\" to blame them for the contents of India's mostly mediocre 70 TV channels and claim it is the broadcasters who should be the target of government legislation. The strike, which is set to go on for three days, has so far only affected Delhi, completely wiping out coverage of the Olympics and all state-run channels. \"So far we have only hit Delhi. But unless the government wakes up soon and does something about the law the strike will spread to Bombay and across the country,\" Vikki Chowdhry, of the Cable TV Operators United Front said last night. \"We are not responsible for what is on TV. The government must scrap this lopsided legislation.\" There was confusion in gov ernment circles as to what, exactly, would fall foul of the new cable network act. By western standards, Indian TV is remarkably chaste with no full frontal nudity and not much kissing. The country's most risque channel is Fashion TV, which shows models gliding down the catwalk, while Indian actresses are required to do nothing more suggestive in Hindi movies than to gyrate in the obligatory wet sari scene. Under the new legislation cable operators will receive a warning if they are deemed to be transmitting obscene material. They then face arrest if they repeat the offence. Delhi's police chief Dr K K Paul, yesterday claimed that certain operators were flouting the rules by transmitting pornography in the early hours of the morning. \"If they are as clean as they say they are, then why are they going ahead with the strike?\" he asked. The law which came into effect two weeks ago has attracted the wrath of India's tobacco advertisers who say they spend only 1% of funds on TV ads. The industry claims that such adverts are shown at times when children are unlikely to be watching. The law's only immediate casualty appears to be adverts for Kingfisher, one of India's most popular beers, which have now been pulled. India's broadcasting minister, Arun Jaitley, has defended the new act, which comes amid wider moves to liberalise Indian TV, including a decision two months ago allowing foreign companies to broadcast to India via cable for the first time. \"We are a liberal society. We will ban cable operators only in the rarest of rare cases. Power to ban any channel is only with central government,\" Mr Jaitley insisted. But under the new, more stringent rules shows deemed to be adult, previously only broadcast between 11pm and6am, have been banned completely. \"All programmes will now have to be in conformity with the code prescribing norms of decency, morality and national security,\" a government spokesman said. An estimated 50m Indians own TV sets, with another 100m believed to have access to television.",

      "body": "<p>The last time UK cinemagoers saw Christopher Walken, he was rampaging round a late 19th-century American town, wielding a sword and butchering the locals. His dialogue was minimal but effective - \"GnnnnrraaaaaGGGhhh! NnnnraaAAAAaaggghhh!!!\" - as he hacked his way through Tim Burton's Hammer tribute Sleepy Hollow. </p> <p>Which is no surprise. Measured by his screen persona, the 57-year-old actor is anything but normal. Take the wheelchair-ridden Man With The Plan in Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead, or the psychotic mob boss Vincenzo Coccotti in True Romance. Indeed, many thought his performance as the demented Frank White in the super-violent gangster flick King Of New York was his most extreme - until last year's Wildside showed him whipping his chauffeur with his underpants while attempting to sodomise him at gunpoint. </p> <p>Recently, however, Walken went even further when he came up with an idea for a TV show that was so far out, nobody would touch it. MTV said no, Bravo said no. The Comedy Channel said no. So what was so dangerous about this show? Was it America's Best-Loved Serial Killers? How To Raise The Dead? The Murder Roadshow? No, Walken simply wanted his own cookery programme. </p> <p>\"It was either 10 or 12 segments,\" he recently told the New York Observer. \"I can't remember. I was going to have some sort of kitchen set-up. I wanted it to be a little like Pee-Wee's Playhouse. I love that show. And I would have maybe a showgirl, you know, with a little thing on, chopping my vegetables. Maybe some musicians. And an audience. Some people to talk to.\" </p> <p>If this seems a little unusual, perhaps some perspective is required here. Walken's father, 97, is a German immigrant who ran a bakery in the New York suburb of Queens. Walken was considering joining the family business and often worked for his father, putting the jam in doughnuts, but a shambolic stint as a delivery boy convinced him otherwise. </p> <p>Today, cooking remains one of Walken's private hobbies, and he rarely eats out. \"I'm amazed people let total strangers mess around with their food,\" he once said. \"When I cook for myself, I know what I'm getting. I use good stuff. I'm not a great chef, I don't have a repertoire, but if you buy the right things and cook them very simply it has to be good.\" </p> <p>Since his breakthrough performance in the harrowing 1978 Vietnam drama The Deer Hunter, Walken has led something of a double life. While his screen roles become all the more bizarre, his home life seems all the more normal. Not many people know, for example, that his real name is Ronnie, and that he trained as a dancer in stage school. The name change was suggested by a Belgian songstress, who hired Walken as part of a trio of backing singers/hoofers in her nightclub act. \"You know,\" she told him, \"I don't really like 'Ronnie'. I think you're more 'Christopher'. Do you mind if I call you Christopher?\" Walken said, \"Call me anything you like, just don't call me late for lunch.\" </p> <p>As a child, Walken and his brother did modelling and advertising work, and at the age of 10 he would get the subway to Manhattan with his brother and hang around the TV studios. He appeared in the background of many family TV shows, such as The Colgate Comedy Hour, and one of his fondest memories is taking part in a sketch with Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. As a teenager, he pursued a song and dance career, and it was during a 60s production of West Side Story that he met his future wife, Georgianne. They married in 1969, and the pair have been together ever since, sharing their small farmstead a few hours outside New York City with their cats. </p> <p>Indeed, it wasn't until 1977, some 30 years into his career, that Walken began to be considered a menacing movie presence, when he landed a small but memorable part as Annie Hall's death-obsessed brother Duane in Woody Allen's hit movie. Duane opened the floodgates, and nowadays, anything goes. In the last 20 years, Walken's fans have seen him causing metaphysical carnage as the angel Gabriel (Prophecy parts l and II) and disco-dancing with aliens after receiving an anal probe (Communion). Strangely, however, these people can't imagine Christopher Walken sitting at home, stroking the cats, dancing with his wife or whipping up a tasty pasta sauce. </p> <p>\"If I wasn't so lazy, I'll tell you what I would do,\" he told the NY Observer. \"I saw this thing on television. This whole thing with people putting cameras in their house, for the net. I thought I'd get a couple of those cameras and put them in my kitchen and just, you know, turn it on whenever I felt like it. Maybe I would have a particular time of day I would do it, or something like that. And to make it amusing, I thought I would have a hotline - you know, a red telephone. And they could call and I could give them advice about their love life... </p> <p>\"You remember a programme called This Is Your Life? I thought I'd have a curtain over to one side and once in a while I'd have a mystery guest. You know, actors are always coming over to my house. Maybe Joe Pesci comes over and makes his tomato sauce. Everybody makes something, you know what I mean? Don't you think that might be amusing?\" </p> <p>Whatever you say, Mr Walken.</p>",
