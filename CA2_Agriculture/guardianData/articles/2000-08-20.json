When Sergei got his call-up papers for compulsory military service last autumn, she begged him not to go, and tried to persuade him to hide at his grandmother's house for a few months to escape conscription.</p> <p>But Sergei Vitchenko, 20, was determined to serve his country and refused to listen to his mother's entreaties. He was delighted when he was dispatched this year to take part in perhaps the most prestigious mission possible within the Russian navy, serving on the country's most sophisticated nuclear submarine cruiser, the Kursk.</p> <p>The conscript Vitchenko was the lowest ranking member of the crew and struggled to be promoted to the position of junior cook. He took pride in his work and his letters home expressed enthusiasm for his new life.</p> <p>As Mrs Avelene made her way yesterday to join the relatives' vigil within the closed military town of Vidyayevo - the headquarters of the Kursk command - she gripped two letters which could be the last words to come out of the doomed submarine - a letter from her son and another from the captain. Sergei's letter arrived a her home in a small country town in Lithuania nine days ago, the day the Kursk went down.</p> <p>The letter, written on four sheets torn out from a child's lined exercise book, gives the impressions of a young submariner experiencing conditions on board a nuclear cruiser.</p> <p>For almost a week after the vessel sank, Mrs Avelene was too worried to sleep or do anything except stare at the television, waiting for news. But yesterday, despite her profound exhaustion, the act of reading aloud her son's last words to her gave her momentary release from her anguish - prompting her first to smile and then to laugh. The worst is that she still thinks her son is alive.</p> <p>\"Dear Mama and Papa Thomas,\" Sergei began the letter to his mother and his stepfather. \"I have received all your letters. I'm sorry I haven't written for such a long time. We were at sea but now we are sitting in the port, loading up rockets. \"</p> <p>Sergei went on to describe his pride at having earned his colours as a true submariner, after his first descent with the Kursk to the bottom of the sea.</p> <p>Apologising for her son's poor handwriting, his grammatical errors and his liberal use of Russian slang, Mrs Avelene, 43, read on: \"We were baptised as submariners - we were called to the command post where everybody drank a cup of sea water and kissed a greased ship's hammer - and then we got these papers and the commander shook everyone's hands. But after drinking the sea water, we all felt a bit sick.\"</p> <p>He told his mother his next trip to sea would be over by the end of August, when he would return to land - and promised to take some pictures of the scenery for her, so she would get an idea of his surroundings. The letter, written on July 23 - just before the submarine embarked on its final journey - ends with another proud reference to his new job: \"Bye, I love you. I miss you. Write to me, Seryozha (a cook).\"</p> <p>Carefully folded alongside this letter, Mrs Avelene has also preserved a letter she received from the submarine's captain, Gennady Lyachin, in May, informing her that her son was serving on the Kursk and praising his progress during his first few months on board.</p> <p>This, too, is handwritten on cheap, rough brown paper. The absence of a typewriter, let alone a computer, is a chilling reminder of the low-tech world in which the captain of one of Russia's most advanced submarines was working.</p> <p>\"The command informs you that your son, sailor Vitchenko Sergei Alexandrovich, is currently serving in the Russian military navy on the nuclear missile submarine Kursk, one of the most modern, battle-capable vessels not only of Russia but of the whole world,\" the captain wrote.</p> <p>Mrs Avelene proudly read on: \"Your son, sailor Vitchenko, has started to grasp his job with interest and dedication. I am certain that for the rest of his life your son will bear the highly respected badge of a Russian submariner with pride, dignity, and honour.\"</p> <p>The letter was signed: \"With my best wishes, Commander of the of the nuclear submarine cruiser, Kursk, Captain G Lyachin.\"</p> <p>Captain Lyachin is believed to have died almost instantly alongside all his senior officers on the Kursk when the vessel's control room exploded and water gushed into the submarine.</p> <p>Mrs Avelene, a builder, arrived in the Arctic town of Murmansk on Saturday after colleagues at the construction firm where she works collected enough money to pay for her plane ticket. She had been unable to afford the fare, and the Russian military had offered no financial support.</p> <p>She was waiting at the railway station yesterday for her daughter to arrive from St Petersburg; naval officials were then to take them to join the 208 other Kursk relatives gathered in Vidyayevo - among them 49 wives, seven fianc\u00e9es, 42 mothers, 11 brothers, 16 sisters and 39 children.</p> <p>In the face of all evidence to the contrary, Mrs Avelene was clinging to the hope that her son is still alive.</p> <p>\"I just want everything to be all right,\" she said. \"I want my son back - whatever condition he is in.

      "bodyText": "Valentina Avelene never wanted her son to go into the navy. When Sergei got his call-up papers for compulsory military service last autumn, she begged him not to go, and tried to persuade him to hide at his grandmother's house for a few months to escape conscription. But Sergei Vitchenko, 20, was determined to serve his country and refused to listen to his mother's entreaties. He was delighted when he was dispatched this year to take part in perhaps the most prestigious mission possible within the Russian navy, serving on the country's most sophisticated nuclear submarine cruiser, the Kursk. The conscript Vitchenko was the lowest ranking member of the crew and struggled to be promoted to the position of junior cook. He took pride in his work and his letters home expressed enthusiasm for his new life. As Mrs Avelene made her way yesterday to join the relatives' vigil within the closed military town of Vidyayevo - the headquarters of the Kursk command - she gripped two letters which could be the last words to come out of the doomed submarine - a letter from her son and another from the captain. Sergei's letter arrived a her home in a small country town in Lithuania nine days ago, the day the Kursk went down. The letter, written on four sheets torn out from a child's lined exercise book, gives the impressions of a young submariner experiencing conditions on board a nuclear cruiser. For almost a week after the vessel sank, Mrs Avelene was too worried to sleep or do anything except stare at the television, waiting for news. But yesterday, despite her profound exhaustion, the act of reading aloud her son's last words to her gave her momentary release from her anguish - prompting her first to smile and then to laugh. The worst is that she still thinks her son is alive. \"Dear Mama and Papa Thomas,\" Sergei began the letter to his mother and his stepfather. \"I have received all your letters. I'm sorry I haven't written for such a long time. We were at sea but now we are sitting in the port, loading up rockets. \" Sergei went on to describe his pride at having earned his colours as a true submariner, after his first descent with the Kursk to the bottom of the sea. Apologising for her son's poor handwriting, his grammatical errors and his liberal use of Russian slang, Mrs Avelene, 43, read on: \"We were baptised as submariners - we were called to the command post where everybody drank a cup of sea water and kissed a greased ship's hammer - and then we got these papers and the commander shook everyone's hands. But after drinking the sea water, we all felt a bit sick.\" He told his mother his next trip to sea would be over by the end of August, when he would return to land - and promised to take some pictures of the scenery for her, so she would get an idea of his surroundings. The letter, written on July 23 - just before the submarine embarked on its final journey - ends with another proud reference to his new job: \"Bye, I love you. I miss you. Write to me, Seryozha (a cook).\" Carefully folded alongside this letter, Mrs Avelene has also preserved a letter she received from the submarine's captain, Gennady Lyachin, in May, informing her that her son was serving on the Kursk and praising his progress during his first few months on board. This, too, is handwritten on cheap, rough brown paper. The absence of a typewriter, let alone a computer, is a chilling reminder of the low-tech world in which the captain of one of Russia's most advanced submarines was working. \"The command informs you that your son, sailor Vitchenko Sergei Alexandrovich, is currently serving in the Russian military navy on the nuclear missile submarine Kursk, one of the most modern, battle-capable vessels not only of Russia but of the whole world,\" the captain wrote. Mrs Avelene proudly read on: \"Your son, sailor Vitchenko, has started to grasp his job with interest and dedication. I am certain that for the rest of his life your son will bear the highly respected badge of a Russian submariner with pride, dignity, and honour.\" The letter was signed: \"With my best wishes, Commander of the of the nuclear submarine cruiser, Kursk, Captain G Lyachin.\" Captain Lyachin is believed to have died almost instantly alongside all his senior officers on the Kursk when the vessel's control room exploded and water gushed into the submarine. Mrs Avelene, a builder, arrived in the Arctic town of Murmansk on Saturday after colleagues at the construction firm where she works collected enough money to pay for her plane ticket. She had been unable to afford the fare, and the Russian military had offered no financial support. She was waiting at the railway station yesterday for her daughter to arrive from St Petersburg; naval officials were then to take them to join the 208 other Kursk relatives gathered in Vidyayevo - among them 49 wives, seven fianc\u00e9es, 42 mothers, 11 brothers, 16 sisters and 39 children. In the face of all evidence to the contrary, Mrs Avelene was clinging to the hope that her son is still alive. \"I just want everything to be all right,\" she said. \"I want my son back - whatever condition he is in. I know we can look after him and help him to get better. \"All my hope is now with the British rescuers and the Norwegians. I'm very happy that they have come to the rescue. They are working heart and soul to help our men. They feel for them far more than our own officials do.\" Mixed in with this desperate, doomed expression of hope, was her deeply felt bitterness at the response of the Russian government and the military to the crisis. She was horrified by the Kremlin's initial refusal of foreign assistance in the rescue operation. \"I'd like to see [President Vladimir] Putin put in a boat and sent to the bottom of the sea - to experience what they went through,\" she said, suddenly overcome with anger. \"People get punished when they betray their country. But what if a country betrays its people?\" She was also dismayed by the lack of support from the military. Her family heard the news of the sinking on the radio late on Sunday evening; early on Monday they sent a telegram to the naval headquarters trying to establish if Sergei had been on board. They received no answer. Mrs Avelene spent hours trying to get through to an emer gency hotline, but failed because the number was always engaged. Finally she saw her son's name listed on television as one of the trapped men. No official had made any attempt to contact her. Looking weary and dazed yesterday, Mrs Avelene insisted that she refused to abandon hope. \"I'm going out of my mind with worry; but I keep asking Seryozha to hold on and not give up until the end.\" Sailor's letter Dear Mama and Papa Thomas, I have received all your letters.

      "bodyText": "The Foreign Office yesterday said it had \"no reason to doubt\" reports that two British policemen who face spying charges in Yugoslavia have been tortured and paraded before jeering crowds. The FO also indicated that Yugoslav officials in Belgrade may be asked today by the British government to explain the latest allegations. According to reports from the Belgrade jail where the men are held in solitary confinement, the pair have complained of beatings and have feared for their lives. \"I felt it was all over, that we were not going to get out alive,\" PC John Yore reportedly said. Detective Sergeant Adrian Prangnell, 41, from Hampshire and PC Yore, 31, from Cambridge, were stopped by an armed border patrol three weeks ago, along with a Canadian construction worker, Shaun Going, 45, and his student nephew, Liam Hall, 19. Mr Prangnell and Mr Yore are reported to have told diplomats that in the five days after their arrest they were subjected to psychological intimidation, punched and kicked, denied sleep and forced to stand for hours in front of walls with their arms extended. All four were legitimately working in Kosovo at the time of their arrest on the Montenegro border. Last night the FO said it was \"very concerned\" about the torture allegations - reported in the Mail on Sunday - but said they needed further investigation. A spokeswoman said: \"We are trying to arrange meetings with Yugoslav officials to establish if these claims have any basis. We feel the best way to help these men is to apply diplomatic pressure. \"We believe [Yugoslav president, Slobodan] Milosevic sees these men as a good propaganda tool to encourage support for himself close to the elections. The timing of their capture is of great significance. He clearly wants some kind of official recognition of his government by the UN. We feel the most effective way of putting pressure on him is to deny him that while these men are held captive.\" Mr Yore and Mr Prangnell were coming to the end of a year's detachment with the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, training local police recruits for the UN. Mr Going was working on a quarry project and had mining equipment including detonation caps in his vehicle. Mr Hall was on holiday. The four took a scenic route to Kosovo in Mr Going's car after a weekend on the Adriatic coast. They were stopped close to the Montenegro-Kosovo border and were found to have the wrong travel permits. An army truck took them to Serb villages where allegedly locals and soldiers denounced them as spies. Psychological terror was used to try to force confessions, said Mr Yore. The men also appeared on Serbian television which claimed they were terrorists trying to overthrow the president.",

      "bodyText": "A French tourist was in hospital last night after being stabbed during an argument over noise with fellow guests at a hotel opposite Windsor Castle in Berkshire. A man aged 34 and a 16-year-old, both from Surrey, were arrested and were being questioned last night at Maidenhead police station in connection with the incident at the four-star Castle Hotel. Police said that the Frenchman, aged 53, and on holiday from Strasbourg together with his wife and eight-year-old daughter, had left their room and gone into a neighbouring room just before 1.30am yesterday, where he became involved in an argument with the occupants. Sergeant Kevin Warner of Thames Valley police said: \"The stabbing took place in another room, where the victim had gone to complain about the noise.\" The man, who has not been named, was taken to Wexham Park hospital in nearby Slough with stab wounds in the chest, where he was operated on. His condition afterward was described as stable. The hotel said it had found alternative accommodation for his wife and daughter. The \u00a3220-a-night hotel is owned by Granada, and is directly opposite Windsor Castle. Last night the hotel's duty manager declined to comment beyond confirming that the incident had taken place.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>When the American drama series thirtysomething was at its peak in the 1980s, a critic observed that the chronological title made the series naturally sequel-friendly. Where thirtysomething followed Hope, Michael, Ethan and the other yuppies through marriage, children and professional ambition, it was easy to imagine a fortysomething in which they got divorced, followed by decadal revisits (like John Updike's sequence of Rabbit novels) until seventysomething tracked them through retirement to the clinic and the grave. </p> <p>In fact, the 90s passed without a fortysomething but now thirtysomething creators Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz have delivered what is, thematically if not in terms of characters, an update. Sky One's Once and Again frequently looks and sounds like thirtysomething, with the difference that it's a post-marriage drama where the first series was a marriage one. </p> <p>Rick (Billy Campbell) is an architect and Lily (Sela Ward) a writer. Recent separation or divorce have not prevented them from maintaining cash-hungry homes, clothes and cars. When they meet at a school soccer match, love breaks above their heads like lightning. The opening episode relies heavily on the generational reverses which powered the comedy in Absolutely Fabulous. As Rick and Lily nervously prepare for a date, their teenage children warn them not to have sex before they really know each other. The parents' fumbling attempt to make love is subsequently interrupted when the children come home unexpectedly. </p> <p>For many watching, this is intended to be the comedy of recognition. Zwick and Herskovitz specialise in what might be called demographic television or mirror fiction. For most of the audience for one of their dramas, what you see is what you've got. They deliver a particular segment of consumers to a network by featuring glossy representatives of the target group - the professional middle-aged middle-classes - in a drama. It was fitting that Michael and Ethan in thirtysomething actually worked in advertising. </p> <p>Indeed, Zwick and Herskovitz's shows are best understood as compellingly extended advertisements. The people have just too much sheen; the houses always look as if the cleaner has just left after a marathon session.

      "bodyText": "When the American drama series thirtysomething was at its peak in the 1980s, a critic observed that the chronological title made the series naturally sequel-friendly. Where thirtysomething followed Hope, Michael, Ethan and the other yuppies through marriage, children and professional ambition, it was easy to imagine a fortysomething in which they got divorced, followed by decadal revisits (like John Updike's sequence of Rabbit novels) until seventysomething tracked them through retirement to the clinic and the grave. In fact, the 90s passed without a fortysomething but now thirtysomething creators Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz have delivered what is, thematically if not in terms of characters, an update. Sky One's Once and Again frequently looks and sounds like thirtysomething, with the difference that it's a post-marriage drama where the first series was a marriage one. Rick (Billy Campbell) is an architect and Lily (Sela Ward) a writer. Recent separation or divorce have not prevented them from maintaining cash-hungry homes, clothes and cars. When they meet at a school soccer match, love breaks above their heads like lightning. The opening episode relies heavily on the generational reverses which powered the comedy in Absolutely Fabulous. As Rick and Lily nervously prepare for a date, their teenage children warn them not to have sex before they really know each other. The parents' fumbling attempt to make love is subsequently interrupted when the children come home unexpectedly. For many watching, this is intended to be the comedy of recognition. Zwick and Herskovitz specialise in what might be called demographic television or mirror fiction. For most of the audience for one of their dramas, what you see is what you've got. They deliver a particular segment of consumers to a network by featuring glossy representatives of the target group - the professional middle-aged middle-classes - in a drama. It was fitting that Michael and Ethan in thirtysomething actually worked in advertising. Indeed, Zwick and Herskovitz's shows are best understood as compellingly extended advertisements. The people have just too much sheen; the houses always look as if the cleaner has just left after a marathon session. And as for the message they're selling, it's the very American one of redemption and endurance. Their most giveaway piece of typing was when they called the female lead in their biggest series Hope. In thirtysomething, plot-line crises - like adultery, cancer, redundancy, child illness - were all opportunities for the couples to reconnect with each other. In Once and Again, Rick and Lily have failed these reconnection tests, but the redemptive message is that sheer blinding romantic love is still possible for divorcees with children.

We think it should be possible to open it with a British or a Russian rescue capsule.\"</p> <p>But the Russian deputy prime minister, Ilya Klebanov, leading a commission of inquiry, said the hatch was so badly damaged it would have to be torn off and that a decision had been made to use a crane on the Norwegian rescue ship to achieve this.</p> <p>There was also disagreement about whether there was air in the compartment behind the hatch. Russian reports said that the chamber was probably flooded, with a sailor apparently trapped inside. Russia says there is scant hope of finding any of the 118 crew alive.</p> <p>The Norwegian divers, who have many years' experience working with oil rigs in the North Sea, found that a valve in the submarine's escape hatch had been opened from the inside, indicating that a crew member had tried to get out, Mr Klebanov said. But there was no indication of whether anyone was in the escape chamber.</p> <p>The British mini-submarine, a type LR5, waited on the surface as the Norwegian divers knocked on the Kursk's hull to see if there was air inside.</p> <p>President Putin, who cut short a holiday by the Black Sea on Saturday to return to Moscow, met a group of Orthodox church leaders shortly after they had led a service canonising Russia's last Tsar.</p> <p>But although he decided to ask for foreign help for the Kursk in the wake of a public clamour for action in Russia, Mr Putin's remarks to the clerics, at least as reported by the news agency Interfax, did not mention any specific thanks from him to outsiders.</p> <p>\"We are all following the tragedy with an aching heart and, without any exaggeration, with tears in our eyes. I want to thank everyone who is helping to cope with our common misfortune, including you clergymen for your sympathy and prayers,\" Mr Putin said.</p> <p>The President appeared to be trying to exonerate the Russian authorities for blame when he added: \"Unfortunately sometimes events, and not we ourselves, dictate the logic of developments.\"</p> <p>There is still no clear explanation for the disaster but Mr Klebanov said yesterday that a collision with a foreign vessel or a second world war mine was the most likely cause.</p> <p>He said that the submarine's front five or six compartments were flooded within seconds. Some crew might have survived for a while in the back three compartments.</p> <p>The US navy, which had two submarines in the area at the time, said none of its vessels was involved in the incident.</p> <p>A Norwegian video camera was first lowered yesterday to survey the hull, and the water was checked for possible radiation leaks from the Kursk's two nuclear reactors, officials said.</p> <p>With little hope left of finding any survivors, the Russian naval authorities have started to plan how to lift the sunken craft to the surface.</p> <p>They admit they will need foreign help to raise it. The Northern fleet's six pontoons were being prepared, but they did not have enough power to lift the massive waterlogged vessel, Mr Klebanov said.</p> <p>The last time a nuclear submarine sank, when the Komsomolets went down in 1989, it was left to rust at the bottom of the sea. The bodies of the men who died in that accident were never recovered.</p> <p>Russian television said the Norwegians had offered to go into the submarine if they could wrench the hatch off.</p> <p>It would be highly risky work and any member of the team who felt unwilling would not be asked to do it. But the chance that they could find anyone still alive in an air pocket is minimal.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Norwegian deep sea divers were battling last night to open a hatch on the stricken Russian submarine, Kursk, after a day in which Russian and Norwegian rescuers openly contradicted each other about the possibility of continuing the rescue mission. Denying a Russian report that the escape hatch was too badly cracked to open, a spokesman for the Norwegian armed forces said the hatch could be opened with the help of a mini-submarine. \"We have not drawn the conclusion that the hatch is so damaged that it cannot be opened,\" John Espen Lien, spokesman for the Norwegian armed forces, said after a team of three Norwegian divers inspected the crippled vessel. \"The hatch is not destroyed and is in a fair condition. We think it should be possible to open it with a British or a Russian rescue capsule.\" But the Russian deputy prime minister, Ilya Klebanov, leading a commission of inquiry, said the hatch was so badly damaged it would have to be torn off and that a decision had been made to use a crane on the Norwegian rescue ship to achieve this. There was also disagreement about whether there was air in the compartment behind the hatch. Russian reports said that the chamber was probably flooded, with a sailor apparently trapped inside. Russia says there is scant hope of finding any of the 118 crew alive. The Norwegian divers, who have many years' experience working with oil rigs in the North Sea, found that a valve in the submarine's escape hatch had been opened from the inside, indicating that a crew member had tried to get out, Mr Klebanov said. But there was no indication of whether anyone was in the escape chamber. The British mini-submarine, a type LR5, waited on the surface as the Norwegian divers knocked on the Kursk's hull to see if there was air inside. President Putin, who cut short a holiday by the Black Sea on Saturday to return to Moscow, met a group of Orthodox church leaders shortly after they had led a service canonising Russia's last Tsar. But although he decided to ask for foreign help for the Kursk in the wake of a public clamour for action in Russia, Mr Putin's remarks to the clerics, at least as reported by the news agency Interfax, did not mention any specific thanks from him to outsiders. \"We are all following the tragedy with an aching heart and, without any exaggeration, with tears in our eyes. I want to thank everyone who is helping to cope with our common misfortune, including you clergymen for your sympathy and prayers,\" Mr Putin said. The President appeared to be trying to exonerate the Russian authorities for blame when he added: \"Unfortunately sometimes events, and not we ourselves, dictate the logic of developments.\" There is still no clear explanation for the disaster but Mr Klebanov said yesterday that a collision with a foreign vessel or a second world war mine was the most likely cause. He said that the submarine's front five or six compartments were flooded within seconds. Some crew might have survived for a while in the back three compartments. The US navy, which had two submarines in the area at the time, said none of its vessels was involved in the incident. A Norwegian video camera was first lowered yesterday to survey the hull, and the water was checked for possible radiation leaks from the Kursk's two nuclear reactors, officials said. With little hope left of finding any survivors, the Russian naval authorities have started to plan how to lift the sunken craft to the surface. They admit they will need foreign help to raise it. The Northern fleet's six pontoons were being prepared, but they did not have enough power to lift the massive waterlogged vessel, Mr Klebanov said. The last time a nuclear submarine sank, when the Komsomolets went down in 1989, it was left to rust at the bottom of the sea. The bodies of the men who died in that accident were never recovered. Russian television said the Norwegians had offered to go into the submarine if they could wrench the hatch off. It would be highly risky work and any member of the team who felt unwilling would not be asked to do it. But the chance that they could find anyone still alive in an air pocket is minimal.",

The combination of these factors left the Mary Rose so unstable that an ill-timed gust of wind would have been enough to scupper her, a documentary will claim tonight. The unexplained sinking of Henry VIII's favourite battleship as she turned to fire on the French fleet in July 1545, while the king watched in horror from the shore, is one of maritime history's great mysteries. Now, new evidence assembled for Channel 4's Secrets of the Dead series suggests a series of errors caused the ship to plunge to the bottom of the Solent, where she remained until 1982. A new examination of the crewing formula used in Henry VIII's day suggests that contrary to previous assumptions, the Mary Rose may have been carrying up to 200 soldiers more than the 415 mariners, soldiers and gunners listed in the official logs. Crammed on to the ship's upper deck along with heavy cannons, they could have fatally shifted her centre of gravity. An analysis of tree rings in the ship's timber suggests that a major refit shortly before she set sail may also have played a part in her sinking. Studies by Christopher Dobbs, an archaeologist at the Mary Rose Trust in Portsmouth, and Martin Bridge of University College London suggest that the crew may have been unfamiliar with newly installed gun ports, not realising that water would flood in if they were left open as the ship turned. \"We've shown that one of the major timbers in the ship, very close to the gun ports, was put in in 1541 or later,\" said Mr Dobbs. \"This suggests, but does not prove, that the gun port too may have been put in at that time.\" This hypothesis is supported by a reconstruction of the moments immediately before the Mary Rose slipped beneath the waves.

For Edinburgh is obviously a capital city. The hills give it a natural grandeur. Its castle is exactly what every romantic schoolboy thinks a castle ought to be. Its commercial buildings are built on the grand scale. And the men who rebuilt Edinburgh in the 18th and 19th centuries - admittedly, mostly Hanoverian enthusiasts for the union - made it monumental. There is no city in the world that more visibly celebrates its favourite sons in statues, obelisks and Corinthian columns. Edinburgh leaves the visitor in no doubt that it is at the heart of a nation.</p> <p>Forty years ago, when I first visited the festival - Jacob Epstein in the Waverley station underground car park and Albert Finney in John Osborne's Luther - Scottish claims to nationhood were represented by an elderly lady who stood outside the National Gallery and offered passing pedestrians tracts about William Wallace and Robert the Bruce. Even pipers on adjacent street corners thought she was crazy. Her ambition for independence has not been fulfilled.

      "bodyText": "Scottish devolution is justified by Edinburgh alone. If there were no other arguments in favour of a Caledonian parliament, the place in which it is situated would be reason enough. For Edinburgh is obviously a capital city. The hills give it a natural grandeur. Its castle is exactly what every romantic schoolboy thinks a castle ought to be. Its commercial buildings are built on the grand scale. And the men who rebuilt Edinburgh in the 18th and 19th centuries - admittedly, mostly Hanoverian enthusiasts for the union - made it monumental. There is no city in the world that more visibly celebrates its favourite sons in statues, obelisks and Corinthian columns. Edinburgh leaves the visitor in no doubt that it is at the heart of a nation. Forty years ago, when I first visited the festival - Jacob Epstein in the Waverley station underground car park and Albert Finney in John Osborne's Luther - Scottish claims to nationhood were represented by an elderly lady who stood outside the National Gallery and offered passing pedestrians tracts about William Wallace and Robert the Bruce. Even pipers on adjacent street corners thought she was crazy. Her ambition for independence has not been fulfilled. And, if the Scots are as sensible a people as I believe them to be, that is how it will remain. But no one can visit the capital without realising that devolution has made a difference. Scotland was always another country - different from the other nations of the union.

When young people, deprived of potential military glory through long years of peace, testify to their higher idealism in public, what do they say? Well Hello, Mr Chips. </p> <p>America's teachers suddenly stand, at least in political legend, on the edge of the canyon called Hope. Teaching is suddenly the most wanted, most admired profession. The new television series - \"from the makers of Ally McBeal\" - is called Boston Public. It will be front-line stuff: gallant staff, big city problems, challenge, failure and heart-warming triumph mingled. The myths are in the making. </p> <p>And the politicians who help make those myths cluster, unusually enough, in the van of eulogy and change. Consider Al Gore. \"At a time when the amount of human knowledge is doubling every five years, we will do bold things to make our schools the best in the world. I will fight for the single greatest commitment to education since the GI bill ... It's time to treat and reward teachers like the professionals they are.\" </p> <p>Consider George W Bush. \"Education reform is empty if it does not take into account the needs of the educators. Teachers are not the object of education reform, they are the engine of education reform. They have a high calling, and we must respect it. As we ask more of teachers, we must do more to help them.\" </p> <p>Bush, moreover, doesn't just hymn \"excellent teachers\" - he covered the convention stage in Philadelphia with them, along with a mock classroom with real pupils where they could display their arts. Show as well as tell. Both he and Gore have decided that the big issue for November's election is education times three. Gore's dad was a teacher. Bush's wife was a teacher. Teachers are wonderful people. </p> <p>Pause and pinch yourself, for the schooling reality here is wholly familiar to any visiting Brit. Public schools - the ones we call state schools - are often fine in leafy suburbs, but much too often lousy in the urban ghettos and ethnic melting pots. Between 40% and 50% of poor kids can emerge from the public system as functional illiterates; 43% of maths teachers in high-poverty areas have no relevant qualifications. Sink schools that David Blunkett would consign to history in Deptford just potter along in Detroit. Eight years of Clinton prosperity have not closed that learning gap. In many ways, as the suburbs have grown leafier, it has opened wider. </p> <p>What's fascinating, though, isn't the similarity of the dilemma, but the difference in the rhetoric. When Bush denounces \"the soft bigotry of expectations, with too many children segregated into schools without standards, shuffled from grade to grade because of their age and regardless of their knowledge\", he doesn't blame the teachers. His targets, of course, are the local and federal bureaucrats who choke the system with their dogma and ineptitude. And though Gore talks warmly about \"more money, higher standards and accountability\", his litany of blame, too, passes the denizens of the classrooms by. </p> <p>The language they both use is curiously military. Gore \"fights away\" in the tradition of the GI bill. The Republican party manifesto platform pledges itself to \"improve teacher training and recruiting by expanding the troops-to-teachers programme, which places retired military personnel in the classroom\". This is a war, to be fought by war-like means in a war-like way. </p> <p> Let's put the respective generals' battle plans to one side. They aren't, in their myriad detail, too helpful. Gore sees pre-school education and better access to college places as the answer: Bush wants to dismantle local education authorities, give school heads supreme power and experiment with vouchers. Britain has mostly been here before - and will probably be here again. The real lesson from America is rather simpler than that. </p> <p>Both candidates talk standards and targets. Both men would tighten monitoring of what goes on behind the school gates. But both lead with more cash in teachers' wage packets as a symbol of their zeal: the front-end sweetener that Bush used in Texas. Both want the teachers on their side, and both know that recruiting and retaining good teachers is the key to success. </p> <p>I don't suppose that Mr Blunkett or Mr Blair - in some ways deeper into this forest - would dissent one jot over substance. On the contrary, they'd dust off their collected speeches and cite countless tributes to the vital role that teachers perform, as well (like George W) as lauding the wonders of merit pay. Yet emotionally the message sounds quite different. </p> <p>The voice of reform, for Blair as for Major before him, belongs to Chris Woodhead - and, inevitably, it is critical, censorious. Woodhead's team inspect schools, inspect teachers. They do an important job and, of course, they mix praise with blame; but they are not the cheerleaders of better times. They are bound to say \"Yes - but\". </p> <p>There are all manner of reasons that schoolteachers, in Britain as in America, don't enjoy the respect, the professional status, that the politicians allegedly seek for them - or the pay which, in either country, still mostly squats in the low \u00a320,000s. One reason, undoubtedly, is an attachment to a version of trade unionism too suspicious of change and too Gradgrind in its responses. Professionalism doesn't come that way. </p> <p>The United States has some school problems we rarely dream of. Not just gun massacres like Columbine, but crime against teachers - more than 1m thefts and 600,000 violent crimes in a five-year period. Its mountains to climb are far more precipitous. But the mood - however frail it ultimately proves - is determined and optimistic. And it begins by getting teachers on side. </p> <p>It woos them with more than cash and promises. It tells them they are lonely, beleaguered members of their community who have, and deserve, political respect. It sets them at the centre of our future - better than lawyers, doctors, cops: the new TV superheroes. Bush shrewdly made such faith seem tangible in Philadelphia as he let two young public headmasters (one from Texas, one from the Bronx) talk onstage about their own special schools - which teach inner city kids 10 hours a day (plus two hours' homework) and demand an intensity of commitment from staff and pupils alike. Stunning effort; stunning results; mesmeric professionals in action. </p> <p>America, typically, thinks that to be good, teachers have to feel good first - that morale can be bestowed and self-esteem constructed.

The cause of death is unknown.</p> <p>Oppenheimer took over the helm of family businesses - the gold mining conglomerate, Anglo-American and the diamond marketing cartel, De Beers in 1957, at the age of 49.

      "bodyText": "Harry Oppenheimer, the billionaire South African mining magnate who oversaw a gold and diamond empire stretching from Johannesburg to the City of London, has died aged 91. The man they called \"Multinational Harry\", whose family firms dominated the South African economy and the world gold and diamond markets for most of the last century, died at a Johannesburg hospital on Saturday night. He had been admitted on Friday night, complaining of stomach pains and a severe headache. The cause of death is unknown. Oppenheimer took over the helm of family businesses - the gold mining conglomerate, Anglo-American and the diamond marketing cartel, De Beers in 1957, at the age of 49. When Anglo American, founded by his father Sir Ernest Oppenheimer in 1917, grew too large and powerful for the limited confines of South Africa, Oppenheimer nurtured it into the world's largest mining company. He was widely credited with the stroke of marketing genius behind the De Beers campaign promoting diamonds as the ultimate gift of love. The advertising blitz culminated in De Beers' famous \"A Diamond is Forever\" campaign. Oppenheimer built a reputation as an audacious corporate operator who used his network of rich and influential contacts to avoid the economic isolation apartheid brought upon his native country. Julian Ogilvie Thompson, Anglo American chairman, described him yesterday as \"one of South Africa's greatest sons\". Tributes flooded in from all sides of the South African political spectrum for Oppenheimer who served as an MP for the opposition United party in South Africa's parliament from 1948 to 1957, as the ruling Nationalist party laid the foundations of the apartheid system. A pragmatist, Oppenheimer was a long-time advocate of reforming the apartheid system, but he was no radical, envisaging at best a limited franchise for the black majority. \"We wish to acknowledge the contribution Mr Oppenheimer made in building the economy of our country, as well as the role he and his company played in creating employment for hundreds of thousands of South Africans as well as citizens of our neighbouring countries,\" ANC spokesman Nat Serache said in a statement. \"Harry Oppenheimer was a man of great intellect, huge personal charm and extraordinary generous philanthropy,\" said Tony Leon, leader of the opposition Democratic party. \"He was also first and foremost a non-racial liberal.\" But the economic success of his firms was also considered crucial to the survival of the apartheid government, which ruled until South Africa's first all-race elections in 1994. His labour-intensive mines thrived on the migrant labour system that forced black workers to live apart from their families in worker hostels. His companies paid black workers far less than its white employees. Oppenheimer's retirement at the end of 1984 as the head of the De Beers mining group, just two years after relinquishing the same office at Anglo American, marked the end of his active control in the family businesses. He lived to see the listing of Anglo American in London and its immediate ranking in the top 25 of the FTSE 100 index in June 1999, with a market capitalisation of $12 bn - a far cry from the \u00a31m his father had used to set up the company 82 years before. Few observers doubt that the chairmanship of Anglo and De Beers will eventually pass to Harry's only son Nicholas (Nicky) Oppenheimer, currently head of De Beers' London-based diamond marketing arm, Central Selling Organisation.",

      "bodyText": "A US navy intelligence officer, who included classified material in love letters to his Israeli paramour, is believed to be on the run in Israel, using a stick-on beard as a disguise. US authorities launched a search for Lieutenant-Colonel Jeremiah Mattysse on August 8, when he failed to return to his base in San Antonio, Texas, after a holiday. He had dealt with highly classified material until earlier this year, according to Yedioth Ahronoth, the Israeli tabloid that broke his story yesterday, when his affair with an Israeli woman living on his base led his supervisors to assign him to less classified duties. Both were married at the time. Adultery is a violation of protocol in the US military, and can lead to court martial. His lover, Rikki Nir, a billowy 48-year-old redhead, said that the two were drawn together by a love for Judaism. Col Mattysse, 50, discovered Judaism a few years ago but Ms Nir persuaded him that his conversion in a Reform synagogue did not go far enough and persuaded him to undergo an Orthodox conversion. Eyebrows were raised when Col Mattysse began preaching Judaism to his colleagues and singing the praises of his newfound love. Ms Nir, who described Col Mattysse as her \"true love\", did not explain how the two reconciled adultery and proselytising with Orthodox Judaism. She said that he joined her in Jerusalem, and lived in bliss until last week, when they learned that Israeli police had agreed to track him down. In an Israel radio interview, Ms Nir said: \"Jeremiah was prepared to help Israel.\" She said he had forwarded her sackfuls of classified material along with declarations of his undying love. Ms Nir had no idea how serious the information was, but it was clear few were taking it seriously when US and Israeli intelligence officers arrived at her home in a suburb of Tel Aviv to collect the material. When they left, they grinned and posed for photographers - behaviour hardly compatible with an alliance-shaking incident. The case, which has delighted tabloid editors in Israel, features some of the elements - but none of the gravitas - of the notorious Pollard and Vanunu cases that rocked Israel in the 1980s. \"Oh please,\" Yossi Melman, Israel's top spywatcher, told Israel radio when asked to compare Col Mattysse to Pollard. \"This is farcical.\" Jonathan Pollard, a former US naval intelligence officer, is serving a life sentence in a North Carolina prison for supplying Israel with roomfuls of classified material in the 1980s. Mordechai Vanunu, sentenced to 18 years in prison in 1987 for selling photographs of Israel's nuclear reactor to the Sunday Times, was tripped up when his own Israeli-American lover turned out to be a Mossad agent. Ms Nir said that Col Mattysse's chosen Hebrew name, \"Yonatan\" was a tribute to Pollard, and said: \"He loves Israel more than the Jews, more than Israelis.\" She accused Israel of betraying him, just as Pollard's allies have accused Israel of not doing enough to press the Clinton administration for his release. \"Coming to Israel was suicide,\" she sighed. She said Col Mattysse had travelled incognito on Israeli buses for a week, wearing a fake moustache and beard, and that this week ultra-Orthodox Jewish friends had smuggled him to Syria.

      "body": "<p>Have secretarial skills, will travel. Demand for British secretaries abroad - and for foreign secretaries in this country - has never been greater and incentives are increasing by the month. So if you're suffering from that annual August urge not only to holiday abroad, but to stay there, you could be in luck. </p> <p>\"Not only is computer technology making secretarial work similar the world over, but businesses themselves are becoming increasingly global,\" says Lisa Hilton, a business manager at global recruitment agency Manpower, which has 3,200 offices in 50 countries. \"They want staff to reflect that.\" </p> <p>Manda Ritchie, an international recruitment consultant, believes there are additional reasons. \"British companies are expanding overseas at a higher rate than ever. That means there is increasing opportunity for British secretaries to work away without learning another language,\" she says. \"Foreign secretaries have more opportunities to come here because of the opening up of Europe: approximately 40,000 arrived last year on a working visa. Finally, cheap air fares - even to destinations like Oz - are encouraging people from practically every western country to pack their bags.\" </p> <p>And why go for the usual nomadic jobs, such as nannying and bar work, when you can make a packet, as well as improve your office skills, by turning your hand to administration? </p> <p>\"Five people from my circle of university-leaving friends did it,\" says graduate Sarah Miggs, 22, who worked as a temp in Brussels for a year. \"It's a great way to discover a bit of the world, while at the same time getting experience in areas like IT and communication, which proves invaluable in practically every future job.\" </p> <p>Like most secretaries with a touch of wanderlust, Miggs applied for work once she had arrived at her destination. But if your travelling dreams require more safety nets, fear not. It is increasingly possible to arrange short or long-term placements before you've even posed for your passport snapshot. </p> <p>For high-flyers, recruitment consultancy Angela Mortimer is currently sponsoring the Mountbatten Scheme. \"This offers graduates the opportunity to complete up to 12 months' work experience and study in New York as a PA,\" explains Annabel Lindsay, head of the graduate and college leaver division. \"If successful, the graduate comes away with a certificate in international business practice. In a world where employers are looking for candidates who can bring more to a company than just a good degree and two weeks' office experience, it is extremely worthwhile.\" She admits, however, that securing one of the 150 annual places is increasingly tough. </p> <p>Sarah Kennedy, 22, who found out about the scheme after her friend returned from an interview at Angela Mortimer clutching a leaflet, agrees. \"My stint was as a PA to three lawyers in a large law firm on Seventh Avenue and I walked into a job as marketing administrator at KPMG in London upon my return. They recognised that a secretarial role in New York is demanding, incredibly fast-paced, and often quite scary. If I could cope with that, they probably realised I was worth investing in.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, international agency Drake offers a less graduate-driven option, giving all temps the chance not only to work in a range of countries, but to build up their \"Drake passport\", consisting of typing skills, IT experience and references. \"For people working abroad, it can be difficult to have an easily verifiable track record. This aims to change that,\" says Lee-Anne Van Heer Den, temporary consultant at Drake UK. </p> <p>Increasingly, British recruitment agencies are teaming up with other consultancies around the world to set up exchange programmes. \"The consultancy we deal with happens to be in Sydney,\" says Amanda Fone, director of Angela Mortimer. Any British secretary on their books simply needs to enquire whether there is anything available \"down under\": \"If you tell us you're off to Australia at the weekend, there's every chance we could have a placement ready for you the following week,\" she says. </p> <p>Similarly, administration staff with the travel bug can take advantage of the larger recruitment consultancies setting up offices abroad. \"We have 3,000 offices across 52 countries,\" says Angela Lewis, resource manager at Adecco. \"All applicants have to do is approach any Adecco office for our worldwide guide and then telephone the head office in the country they're interested in to arrange to have an application form mailed to them.\" </p> <p>But make sure you know the facts before you pack your bags. Among the questions you should be asking is whether it is legal for British people to work in your chosen country. If yes, what documentation will you need and what financial arrangements must you make? Should your CV be in a different format? What is the employment rate like and will you be guaranteed work for a particular length of time? Manda Ritchie suggests finding out as much as possible from the embassy or consulate. \"They can give you information on work permits, accommodation and employment,\" she explains. </p> <p>Australia is the current hot spot for travelling secretaries, with Melbourne a firm favourite. Provided you have a work visa, it is legal to work there for three months at a stretch. In other countries, however, doing anything other than voluntary work could be overstaying your welcome. </p> <p>Philippe Milloux, deputy head of the French Institute in London, claims it's worth enquiring how much you can expect to be paid after tax. In Ireland, for instance, income tax can hit you like a slap in the face. And in France you could get paid half what you would expect here. \"Mind you, in Paris you can rent a flat for a month for what you might pay for a week in London,\" stresses Milloux. </p> <p>You'll also want to consider quali fications. Julie Holmes, business development manager for the Netherlands at recruitment agency Crone Corkill, points out that PA roles in Holland are less secretarial and more assistant-based. \"It's not unusual for a PA to the head of marketing to have a degree in marketing and to be given their own projects,\" she points out. </p> <p>A major concern for travelling secretaries is what kind of language skills will be expected. This entirely depends on the consultancy and country in question, the size of the company, the nature of your position, and the sector. Finance and banking, fashion and cosmetics, and management consultancy, for example, are more likely to require some knowledge of the local language. But even if you find work in a foreign-speaking country that doesn't require you to know the language, it is worth attempting to learn the basics. Not only is it polite but it will improve your social life. </p> <p>A little prior knowledge can also help to overcome tricky cultural differences, says Angelena Boden, author of The Cultural Gaffes Pocketbook (Management Pocketbooks, \u00a36.99). First names, for instance, are still not used in certain areas of the continent. And even apparently international gestures such as nodding or shaking your head can lead to confusion: in Bulgaria and parts of Greece, Turkey and Iran, for instance, \"yes\" is signalled by a lateral head sway, which can easily be confused with a shake of the head. </p> <p>\"Germans have a much more direct attitude than the English, and you've got to be able to handle that and not be offended,\" adds Cathy Fawcett, a senior consultant at Language Recruitment Services. \"Meanwhile, Spanish and Italians are flamboyant. The stiff upper-lipped English secretary who winds up there could find him or herself booking a return flight within a week.\" </p> <p> <strong>Case studies: a Melburnian in London and a Londoner in Melbourne</strong></p> <p><strong> Natalie Doherty</strong> , 27, from Melbourne, is currently working as an office manager for KiCap Management in London </p> <p>'Having spent a couple of months touring Africa en route, I arrived in London and signed up with Joslin Rowe. They got me secretarial work pretty much immediately. Most of the assignments were fairly brief, because that's what I'd asked for. I figured it would be the best way to meet people and to get time off in between to discover England. I was right. I made a lot of lasting friends and had loads of fun. </p> <p>\"It also enabled me to learn a great deal about different computer systems, which I wanted to show off on my CV, and gave me huge confidence. Now, if I go into a job and they say, 'We assume you're familiar with system x ,' my reply is, 'No, but I can assure you I'll know it back to front within a couple of days.' </p> <p>\"People often think that secretarial work is boring, but I've met clients, organised conferences in Paris and Dublin, and been given lots of responsibility. It helps that I've had great jobs. </p> <p>\"Eventually, I settled down in a more permanent assignment at a company called Fidelity Investments - they've offered me a job in their Sydney offices when I get back in October.\" </p> <p><strong> Elizabeth Holmes </strong> , 28, from London, recently worked as a secretary in Melbourne.

      "bodyText": "Have secretarial skills, will travel. Demand for British secretaries abroad - and for foreign secretaries in this country - has never been greater and incentives are increasing by the month. So if you're suffering from that annual August urge not only to holiday abroad, but to stay there, you could be in luck. \"Not only is computer technology making secretarial work similar the world over, but businesses themselves are becoming increasingly global,\" says Lisa Hilton, a business manager at global recruitment agency Manpower, which has 3,200 offices in 50 countries. \"They want staff to reflect that.\" Manda Ritchie, an international recruitment consultant, believes there are additional reasons. \"British companies are expanding overseas at a higher rate than ever. That means there is increasing opportunity for British secretaries to work away without learning another language,\" she says. \"Foreign secretaries have more opportunities to come here because of the opening up of Europe: approximately 40,000 arrived last year on a working visa. Finally, cheap air fares - even to destinations like Oz - are encouraging people from practically every western country to pack their bags.\" And why go for the usual nomadic jobs, such as nannying and bar work, when you can make a packet, as well as improve your office skills, by turning your hand to administration? \"Five people from my circle of university-leaving friends did it,\" says graduate Sarah Miggs, 22, who worked as a temp in Brussels for a year. \"It's a great way to discover a bit of the world, while at the same time getting experience in areas like IT and communication, which proves invaluable in practically every future job.\" Like most secretaries with a touch of wanderlust, Miggs applied for work once she had arrived at her destination. But if your travelling dreams require more safety nets, fear not. It is increasingly possible to arrange short or long-term placements before you've even posed for your passport snapshot. For high-flyers, recruitment consultancy Angela Mortimer is currently sponsoring the Mountbatten Scheme. \"This offers graduates the opportunity to complete up to 12 months' work experience and study in New York as a PA,\" explains Annabel Lindsay, head of the graduate and college leaver division. \"If successful, the graduate comes away with a certificate in international business practice. In a world where employers are looking for candidates who can bring more to a company than just a good degree and two weeks' office experience, it is extremely worthwhile.\" She admits, however, that securing one of the 150 annual places is increasingly tough. Sarah Kennedy, 22, who found out about the scheme after her friend returned from an interview at Angela Mortimer clutching a leaflet, agrees. \"My stint was as a PA to three lawyers in a large law firm on Seventh Avenue and I walked into a job as marketing administrator at KPMG in London upon my return. They recognised that a secretarial role in New York is demanding, incredibly fast-paced, and often quite scary. If I could cope with that, they probably realised I was worth investing in.\" Meanwhile, international agency Drake offers a less graduate-driven option, giving all temps the chance not only to work in a range of countries, but to build up their \"Drake passport\", consisting of typing skills, IT experience and references. \"For people working abroad, it can be difficult to have an easily verifiable track record. This aims to change that,\" says Lee-Anne Van Heer Den, temporary consultant at Drake UK. Increasingly, British recruitment agencies are teaming up with other consultancies around the world to set up exchange programmes. \"The consultancy we deal with happens to be in Sydney,\" says Amanda Fone, director of Angela Mortimer. Any British secretary on their books simply needs to enquire whether there is anything available \"down under\": \"If you tell us you're off to Australia at the weekend, there's every chance we could have a placement ready for you the following week,\" she says. Similarly, administration staff with the travel bug can take advantage of the larger recruitment consultancies setting up offices abroad. \"We have 3,000 offices across 52 countries,\" says Angela Lewis, resource manager at Adecco. \"All applicants have to do is approach any Adecco office for our worldwide guide and then telephone the head office in the country they're interested in to arrange to have an application form mailed to them.\" But make sure you know the facts before you pack your bags. Among the questions you should be asking is whether it is legal for British people to work in your chosen country. If yes, what documentation will you need and what financial arrangements must you make? Should your CV be in a different format? What is the employment rate like and will you be guaranteed work for a particular length of time? Manda Ritchie suggests finding out as much as possible from the embassy or consulate. \"They can give you information on work permits, accommodation and employment,\" she explains. Australia is the current hot spot for travelling secretaries, with Melbourne a firm favourite. Provided you have a work visa, it is legal to work there for three months at a stretch. In other countries, however, doing anything other than voluntary work could be overstaying your welcome. Philippe Milloux, deputy head of the French Institute in London, claims it's worth enquiring how much you can expect to be paid after tax. In Ireland, for instance, income tax can hit you like a slap in the face. And in France you could get paid half what you would expect here. \"Mind you, in Paris you can rent a flat for a month for what you might pay for a week in London,\" stresses Milloux. You'll also want to consider quali fications. Julie Holmes, business development manager for the Netherlands at recruitment agency Crone Corkill, points out that PA roles in Holland are less secretarial and more assistant-based. \"It's not unusual for a PA to the head of marketing to have a degree in marketing and to be given their own projects,\" she points out. A major concern for travelling secretaries is what kind of language skills will be expected. This entirely depends on the consultancy and country in question, the size of the company, the nature of your position, and the sector. Finance and banking, fashion and cosmetics, and management consultancy, for example, are more likely to require some knowledge of the local language. But even if you find work in a foreign-speaking country that doesn't require you to know the language, it is worth attempting to learn the basics. Not only is it polite but it will improve your social life. A little prior knowledge can also help to overcome tricky cultural differences, says Angelena Boden, author of The Cultural Gaffes Pocketbook (Management Pocketbooks, \u00a36.99). First names, for instance, are still not used in certain areas of the continent. And even apparently international gestures such as nodding or shaking your head can lead to confusion: in Bulgaria and parts of Greece, Turkey and Iran, for instance, \"yes\" is signalled by a lateral head sway, which can easily be confused with a shake of the head. \"Germans have a much more direct attitude than the English, and you've got to be able to handle that and not be offended,\" adds Cathy Fawcett, a senior consultant at Language Recruitment Services. \"Meanwhile, Spanish and Italians are flamboyant. The stiff upper-lipped English secretary who winds up there could find him or herself booking a return flight within a week.\" Case studies: a Melburnian in London and a Londoner in Melbourne Natalie Doherty , 27, from Melbourne, is currently working as an office manager for KiCap Management in London 'Having spent a couple of months touring Africa en route, I arrived in London and signed up with Joslin Rowe. They got me secretarial work pretty much immediately. Most of the assignments were fairly brief, because that's what I'd asked for. I figured it would be the best way to meet people and to get time off in between to discover England. I was right. I made a lot of lasting friends and had loads of fun. \"It also enabled me to learn a great deal about different computer systems, which I wanted to show off on my CV, and gave me huge confidence. Now, if I go into a job and they say, 'We assume you're familiar with system x ,' my reply is, 'No, but I can assure you I'll know it back to front within a couple of days.' \"People often think that secretarial work is boring, but I've met clients, organised conferences in Paris and Dublin, and been given lots of responsibility. It helps that I've had great jobs. \"Eventually, I settled down in a more permanent assignment at a company called Fidelity Investments - they've offered me a job in their Sydney offices when I get back in October.\" Elizabeth Holmes , 28, from London, recently worked as a secretary in Melbourne. She now works as a senior contracts sales consultant for ASR in London First stop, Sydney. I had no money, no friends, no accommodation. \"But Adecco saved the day by getting me secretarial temporary work straight away. [At work] I met two girls who I moved into a flat with in Bondi Beach.

My employer even put me on the payroll so that he could keep me on for a while. \"After a few months, when I'd saved enough money, I travelled all over Australia and wound up in Melbourne.

Or is it Morse who's supposed to be so appendaged? The murderer could be murdering a-go-go on the bonnet of Morse's neat little car with a T-shirt that says \"I am a cold-blooded - yet genteel - killer\" and I still wouldn't work out whodunnit, so perplexed am I by the prospect of John Thaw's wooden extremity.

Only last week, Tom Mangold's investigation of the scandal of the Erika, a 25-year-old rustbucket of a tanker which, in 1999, caused one of the worst oil spills Europe has ever seen, was a shining example of intelligent, impartial and thorough investigative journalism, journeying from Paris to Bombay in search of answers. Non-partisan yet on the side of the angels, it was exemplary TV news journalism. </p> <p>This week though, Correspondent was a much more personal undertaking - for Mufadzi Nkomo, who returned to Zimbabwe after ten years of living in London to rediscover her mother- country. And once again, it was exceptional, its strength coming from Nkomo's closeness to the subject. </p> <p>Made during Zimbabwe's most hotly-contested - and bloody - elections since independence, Nkomo's intimate film illuminated the situation in Zimbabwe infinitely better than anything else I've seen on TV news, adding new dimensions and perspectives to a situation currently only represented in footage from a country that doesn't seem much different from the tales of savages brought back from the Dark Continent 100 years ago. By speaking to people, including members of her own family, from all sides of the political divides, Nkomo explored the history of Zimbabwe, its present and its potential futures, all of which are, naturally, intrinsically linked. Dumbing down? Never heard of it. </p> <p>There's a theory which proposes, not entirely unconvincingly, that the age of TV's executives can be charted through its sitcoms. In the beginning they focused on young couples, new to married bliss. Then came sitcoms revolving round slightly older couples, perhaps with young children. After them, comedies about empty nests, and finally sitcoms about older people, who were doddery old buffers (comedy grandparents mainly) in the first sitcoms, but are now bursting with life. And so it came to pass that TV executives - at ITV and BBC1 at least - are angst-ridden curmudgeons who want to be like Lionel and Jean from <strong> As Time Goes By</strong> (BBC1, Sun). </p> <p>Similarly, the age of TV's commissioning editors can be roughly judged by the era over which they salivate nostalgically. Considering the <strong> I Love the Seventies</strong> (BBC2, Sat) season on at the moment, have a guess at the age of who's in charge of that channel.

      "bodyText": "It's hard to believe that Georgian England could send a message from London to Portsmouth in 12 seconds, but there is a five-storey octagonal tower off the M25 in Surrey to testify to the achievement. Francis Spufford tells the story in Dead Media (9.30am, Radio 4), the first of four programmes recalling mankind's endless ingenuity with communications. From 1822 Chatley tower was one of the Admiralty's chain of semaphore stations in constant touch with the fleet (provided the period's regular smogs lifted sufficiently). Andrew Jennings is not a great admirer of the International Olympic Committee which, for its part, has tried quite hard to get him imprisoned. On the eve of the Sydney Olympiad, Jennings launches a four-part series on The Truth About The Olympics (7.30pm, Radio 5 Live). His opening programme looks in detail at members of this self-perpetuating oligarchy and at the deplorable Falangist past of its millionaire president Juan Antonio Samaranch.",

      "body": "<p>Whenever we dwindling aficionados of the music hall get together, we play the \"bill matter game\". Who was the \"Cheekie Chappie\"? Who was \"The Thief of Bad Gags\"?</p> <p>Bill matter was the name for the descriptive copyline under the name of each \"turn\" on the playbills that adorned the boards advertising the week's attractions. Max Miller was billed as the Cheekie Chappie and American comic Milton Berle was the Thief. Other memorable bill matter included: \"The Prime Minister of Mirth\" (Dan Leno) and \"Fiddling and Fooling\" (Ted Ray). One of my favourites, perhaps not politically correct these days, was a speciality act (jugglers, acrobats and the like) called the Aberdonians. Their bill matter was \"Too Mean To Tell You What They Do\".</p> <p>Idly watching a rather dull soccer match recently, I started musing about bill matter for footballers. Norman Hunter, once of Leeds and England, got close with his \"Bites Yer Legs\" tag. But of today's stars, how about \"Gallic charmer\" for David Ginola, or \"Who's A Naughty Boy\" under Paul Gascoigne's name? Darren Anderton would undoubtedly be billed as \"Direct from the NHS\" (or should that read Harley Street?)</p> <p>Silly, really. But this whimsy set me further thinking about the converging business cultures of showbiz and today's soccer. Music hall turns were all freelances, picking up bookings from week to week wherever the theatre owners had a vacancy. The variety agents made their living booking these turns round the halls, week by week. The call would emerge from Moss Empires theatres that they were a ventriloquist short for Easter week at the Holborn Empire, and the agents would hit the phones.</p> <p>Since the Bosman ruling gave footballers the right to free transfers on expiry of their contract, the average stay of any player at any club has shrunk dramatically, with a few honourable exceptions like Tony Adams's 20 years at Arsenal. Benito Carbone, soccer's answer to the Scarlet Pimpernel (they seek him here, they seek him there) has had half a dozen different clubs in fewer years - and he is not alone. The free movement of players, particularly the star attractions who can sell tickets, begins more and more to resemble the itinerant world of the music hall.</p> <p>Now I read with horror and foreboding that the EU is thinking of abolishing transfer fees, hastening the day when players will define long-term loyalty as having played one whole home and one whole away match for their club.</p> <p>In this free-for-all world, most players will have agents, but the journeymen who don't will be reduced to taking advertisements on the internet player exchange (<a href=\"http://www.playersRus.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.playersRus.com)</a> which might read: \"Clogger Bloggins, two good feet, can play midfield or up front, own boots. Unexpectedly available due to a misunderstanding. Call now.\"</p> <p>If the trend continues and, worse, is accelerated by the mooted EU ruling, I can see the day dawning very soon when managers spend their weeks frantically ringing round the booking agents, as Val Parnell used to ring ace variety agents Lew and Leslie Grade in the 50s and 60s, desperately seeking stars and supporting acts for his London Palladium, which changed attractions every week. Soccer is headed the same way.</p> <p>I can hear Alex Ferguson, as soon as one season ends, struggling to fill in his blank team sheets for the whole of the following season and calling round the agents: \"I need a headline striker for the Everton match at Old Trafford on September 10 - is Andy Cole free on that day?

      "bodyText": "Whenever we dwindling aficionados of the music hall get together, we play the \"bill matter game\". Who was the \"Cheekie Chappie\"? Who was \"The Thief of Bad Gags\"? Bill matter was the name for the descriptive copyline under the name of each \"turn\" on the playbills that adorned the boards advertising the week's attractions. Max Miller was billed as the Cheekie Chappie and American comic Milton Berle was the Thief. Other memorable bill matter included: \"The Prime Minister of Mirth\" (Dan Leno) and \"Fiddling and Fooling\" (Ted Ray). One of my favourites, perhaps not politically correct these days, was a speciality act (jugglers, acrobats and the like) called the Aberdonians. Their bill matter was \"Too Mean To Tell You What They Do\". Idly watching a rather dull soccer match recently, I started musing about bill matter for footballers. Norman Hunter, once of Leeds and England, got close with his \"Bites Yer Legs\" tag. But of today's stars, how about \"Gallic charmer\" for David Ginola, or \"Who's A Naughty Boy\" under Paul Gascoigne's name? Darren Anderton would undoubtedly be billed as \"Direct from the NHS\" (or should that read Harley Street?) Silly, really. But this whimsy set me further thinking about the converging business cultures of showbiz and today's soccer. Music hall turns were all freelances, picking up bookings from week to week wherever the theatre owners had a vacancy. The variety agents made their living booking these turns round the halls, week by week. The call would emerge from Moss Empires theatres that they were a ventriloquist short for Easter week at the Holborn Empire, and the agents would hit the phones. Since the Bosman ruling gave footballers the right to free transfers on expiry of their contract, the average stay of any player at any club has shrunk dramatically, with a few honourable exceptions like Tony Adams's 20 years at Arsenal. Benito Carbone, soccer's answer to the Scarlet Pimpernel (they seek him here, they seek him there) has had half a dozen different clubs in fewer years - and he is not alone. The free movement of players, particularly the star attractions who can sell tickets, begins more and more to resemble the itinerant world of the music hall. Now I read with horror and foreboding that the EU is thinking of abolishing transfer fees, hastening the day when players will define long-term loyalty as having played one whole home and one whole away match for their club. In this free-for-all world, most players will have agents, but the journeymen who don't will be reduced to taking advertisements on the internet player exchange (www.playersRus.com) which might read: \"Clogger Bloggins, two good feet, can play midfield or up front, own boots. Unexpectedly available due to a misunderstanding. Call now.\" If the trend continues and, worse, is accelerated by the mooted EU ruling, I can see the day dawning very soon when managers spend their weeks frantically ringing round the booking agents, as Val Parnell used to ring ace variety agents Lew and Leslie Grade in the 50s and 60s, desperately seeking stars and supporting acts for his London Palladium, which changed attractions every week. Soccer is headed the same way. I can hear Alex Ferguson, as soon as one season ends, struggling to fill in his blank team sheets for the whole of the following season and calling round the agents: \"I need a headline striker for the Everton match at Old Trafford on September 10 - is Andy Cole free on that day? What? No it's not on Sky. Oh, he only does TV matches, does he - sorry. Anyone else on your books you can suggest? Alan Shearer? Not sure he isn't over-exposed at Old Trafford, he played for me against Charlton three weeks ago and didn't score.\" Ferguson puts the phone down and finds another booking agent, this time with more success: Michael Owen is recovered from injury and unexpectedly free. \"What does he want for one match against Everton? Er, no it's not televised.\" The agent reels off the contract requirements: *25% of the gross, including the gate money, any radio, TV, internet and ad revenues. *He gets his own dressing room, four car park spaces and 20 tickets for his entourage. *Right to approve all publicity material. *Right to approve his striking partner. *He brings his own masseur, physio and hairdresser at the club's expense. *He can't be substituted during the game other than by mutual consent between the player and the designated manager. *He will not play against Roy Keane. *Right to approve the referee, not to be unreasonably withheld. *Any fines for misconduct incurred paid gross by Manchester United. *If the manager is sacked before the game, Owen has the right to withdraw if he doesn't like Ferguson's replacement. *Oh, and no one gets bigger billing in the programme or in any paid advertising. Ferguson pauses - he knows Everton has already booked Dwight Yorke for this game, which is being billed as a grudge-revenge match. \"OK, it's a deal. Email me the contract,\" says Ferguson, who now has to book a squad to build around Owen for this match. In showbiz, it is called casting. The Old Trafford publicity and marketing team are called in and told eventually of the team Ferguson has put together and the top-of-the- bill attraction. \"Owen?\" they cry, \"He'll take some selling - he emptied Stamford Bridge last year when he went there for Bradford City.

      "body": "<p>They simply can't resist it, can they? Tony Blair and Cherie, walking hand in hand the day after Labour won the general election in 1997; Al Gore and Tipper, snogging on the podium at the Democratic convention in Los Angeles last week. In the latter case, the subtext was so loud it might as well have been broadcast over loudspeakers: I am a happily married family man. I am not, repeat not, Bill Clinton. Thus was another hostage given to fortune, another politician publicly committed to family values - territory already staked out by Gore's choice of Joe Lieberman, a socially conservative Orthodox Jew, as his running mate. But these values are quite at odds with how most people actually conduct their lives.</p> <p>Few of us have perfect marriages. Americans are as prone as the rest of us to serial relationships, although their apparently innate, can-do optimism means they just keep on getting married, sometimes four or five times. But it is not only marriage that fails to conform to the happy families model so beloved of politicians in search of votes - including, although it is scarcely credible with hindsight, William Jefferson Clinton, on the stump with Hillary back in 1992. Many voters are parents of teenage children who stay out late, occasionally drink too much and wake up the neighbours when they finally arrive home.</p> <p>This is normal behaviour, even in a politician's family. It is awkward and embarrassing only if the politician in question is given to delivering homilies about parental responsibility and the evils of drink. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that this unfortunate conjunction, as much as concern over media intrusion, lay behind Downing Street's stern denials at the weekend that the prime minister's eldest son had annoyed other guests at an Italian hotel when he returned in the early hours from a nightclub.

      "bodyText": "They simply can't resist it, can they? Tony Blair and Cherie, walking hand in hand the day after Labour won the general election in 1997; Al Gore and Tipper, snogging on the podium at the Democratic convention in Los Angeles last week. In the latter case, the subtext was so loud it might as well have been broadcast over loudspeakers: I am a happily married family man. I am not, repeat not, Bill Clinton. Thus was another hostage given to fortune, another politician publicly committed to family values - territory already staked out by Gore's choice of Joe Lieberman, a socially conservative Orthodox Jew, as his running mate. But these values are quite at odds with how most people actually conduct their lives. Few of us have perfect marriages. Americans are as prone as the rest of us to serial relationships, although their apparently innate, can-do optimism means they just keep on getting married, sometimes four or five times. But it is not only marriage that fails to conform to the happy families model so beloved of politicians in search of votes - including, although it is scarcely credible with hindsight, William Jefferson Clinton, on the stump with Hillary back in 1992. Many voters are parents of teenage children who stay out late, occasionally drink too much and wake up the neighbours when they finally arrive home. This is normal behaviour, even in a politician's family. It is awkward and embarrassing only if the politician in question is given to delivering homilies about parental responsibility and the evils of drink. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that this unfortunate conjunction, as much as concern over media intrusion, lay behind Downing Street's stern denials at the weekend that the prime minister's eldest son had annoyed other guests at an Italian hotel when he returned in the early hours from a nightclub. Blair's spin machine could easily have shrugged off the whole thing, pointing out that the boy is 16 and on holiday. Instead, reports in the Italian press of rowdy behaviour were categorically denied by Downing Street and the family friends who were entertaining Euan on the island of Ponza.

      "bodyText": "Patient trials show that the fat-fighting properties of a popular supplement for slimmers do work. Studies in the United States and Norway revealed that conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) helped the overweight shed fat, and improved the control of adult-onset diabetes. CLA is a fatty acid occurring in many dairy products and beef. Studies on animals suggest it also enhances immune function, and combats several types of cancer and narrowing of the arteries. Results of the first human trials of the supplement were presented at the annual meeting of the American Chemical Society in Washington. Eighty overweight people, in a study at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, dieted and exercised. Most initially lost weight and then regained it on stopping their diets. But those taking CLA regained less fat and retained more muscle. Results from Norway suggested CLA might aid weight loss even without dieting. At Purdue University, Indiana, an eight-week diabetes study with 22 volunteers showed that, of those taking CLA, 64% showed an improvement in insulin levels. Martha Belury, a chief researcher, said coupling CLA with pharmaceuticals could cut the health care costs of type-two diabetes and the side effects of long-term drug use.",

      "body": "<p>Iran's moves towards democratic rule, which began three years ago with the landslide victory of President Mohammad Khatami, appear little more than a fleeting moment in history now that conservatives have reasserted their control.</p> <p>Hardliners in the judiciary have closed almost two dozen newspapers and journals. Nearly all the country's prominent reformist journalists have been imprisoned, prompting the Paris-based Reporters sans Fronti\u00e8res to declare last week that Iran is the \"world's largest prison for journalists\".</p> <p>And reformist leaders have been muzzled out of fear that conservative clerics on the powerful Guardian Council could try to expel MPs from their seats for being insufficiently \"Islamic\". The reformers are also deprived of their main political weapon - public protest - because any major confrontation with security forces in the hands of conservatives would be likely to end in a bloodbath.</p> <p>Six months ago, when reformers rose to victory on President Khatami's coattails, capturing a majority of seats in the first round of parliamentary polls, there was great hope that political pluralism could overcome 2,500 years of centralised rule. But today the picture looks very different.</p> <p>The reformist majority in parliament proved to be ineffectual earlier this month, when the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, used his power to kill a proposed bill which would have gone a long way towards reviving the banned press. A press court acted immediately, closing the last major progressive newspaper, Bahar, and jailing more journalists.</p> <p>But even before Ayatollah Khamenei's unprecedented action, leading reformers were already acknowledging that their majority in parliament had vast limitations. \"Being a majority does not necessarily bring power. If we wish to reform everything overnight, then undoubtedly our wishes will not come true,\" Mohammad Reza Khatami, deputy speaker of parliament and brother of the president, told the Guardian on July 21.</p> <p>Holding the presidency, too, has failed to produce the degree of power the reformers had expected. With a mandate of 20m votes, or 70% of the electorate, President Khatami assumed he could implement vast change. But as the leader of the opposition movement who managed to enter the power structure, he has been required to make such compromises with the conservative establishment that he has been reduced to a symbol of Iran's potential. As an intellectual cleric and humanitarian, Mr Khatami holds out the promise that Iran could form an Islamic-style democracy, but that dream is far from being realised.</p> <p>With no control over the armed forces, which in Iran include the police, and little influence within the judiciary, driven primarily by political rather than legal considerations, Mr Khatami has been silenced as conservatives in these institutions trample his loyalists.</p> <p>In times of political crisis, Mr Khatami generally stays out of public view. However, in a speech on Wednesday before the leading student group which helped bring him to power, the president vowed to remain true to the reforms he promised three years go. But he said change must come slowly - an apparent signal that he wanted to avoid confrontation.</p> <p>\"I stand firm on my promises. We ought to have a free climate for expression of views and not betray people's dreams. But I believe there is no other way to reach our goals than through a calm and gradual process,\" said Mr Khatami.</p> <p><b> Khatami criticised</b><br> Some reformers criticise the president and other like-minded loyalists for their refusal to confront the conservatives. \"I sat in a room with the leading reformers when the conservatives arrested the first journalist, and I said we must organise protests, we must stop this with force,\" said one leading activist who wished to remain anonymous.</p> <p>\"But the reformers said: 'We can't make trouble now that we are part of the game. We have to cooperate.' And the more they compromised, the more they watched their friends get arrested. Now, all the people who were sitting in that room with me are in jail.\"</p> <p>The conservatives, at first caught off guard by the Khatami onslaught, changed their strategy several months ago and began using all their institutional might to quash the reformers. In the early days of the Khatami presidency, it was primarily Islamic vigilantes who broke up peaceful rallies and beat intellectuals at university lectures.</p> <p>But in recent months, the militant fringe has taken a backseat to powerful conservatives who hold legitimate positions in government. Now, it is hardliners in the judiciary who are eliminating people they call their \"enemies\", rather than shadowy religious extremists with high-level backing.</p> <p>Ayatollah Khamenei, the symbol of the conservative establishment, has decided to move to the forefront, issuing directives that conservatives within the judiciary or law enforcement then follow. The first wave of newspaper closures, for example, came two days after Ayatollah Khamenei declared in April that the reformist papers were \"bases of the enemy\".</p> <p>As his health worsens -he is believed to have prostate cancer - Ayatollah Khamenei appears more determined to secure the conservatives' hold on power before his death. But the price he is paying for the crackdown is immense; he has ceased being a sacred, untouchable public figure. By throwing himself directly into the political fray, he is now the subject of criticism in the way any political figure might be.</p> <p>University students chant slogans against him at rallies. And even more unprecedented, some theologians in the holy Shi'ite city of Qom have dared to distribute leaflets criticising him on theological and political grounds.</p> <p>The main issue driving the conservatives' onslaught is their belief that divine rule has power over the republic. \"Islam was the government of God, not the government of the people,\" said Ayatollah Mohammad Taqi Mesbah-Yazdi, a leading ideologue of the right. They are also reacting to the growing belief in society that clerics should remain outside politics, as they had for centuries.</p> <p>The February parliamentary polls saw fewer clerics elected to office since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, causing alarm in the conservative camp, which subscribes to the belief articulated by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini: \"Those intellectuals who say that the clergy should leave politics and go back to the mosque speak on behalf of Satan.\"</p> <p>In allowing Mohammad Khatami to run for office, the establishment hoped a moderate mullah could save the declining reputation of the clergy. Mr Khatami was selected to show Iran and the world that religious moderation was possible in an Islamic government.</p> <p>But three years on, Mr Khatami and the reformers are at a crossroads. Will the only achievement of their movement, billed as Islam's great Enlightenment, be the freedom women now enjoy to walk city streets wearing open-toed sandals and red lipstick?</p>",

      "bodyText": "Iran's moves towards democratic rule, which began three years ago with the landslide victory of President Mohammad Khatami, appear little more than a fleeting moment in history now that conservatives have reasserted their control. Hardliners in the judiciary have closed almost two dozen newspapers and journals. Nearly all the country's prominent reformist journalists have been imprisoned, prompting the Paris-based Reporters sans Fronti\u00e8res to declare last week that Iran is the \"world's largest prison for journalists\". And reformist leaders have been muzzled out of fear that conservative clerics on the powerful Guardian Council could try to expel MPs from their seats for being insufficiently \"Islamic\". The reformers are also deprived of their main political weapon - public protest - because any major confrontation with security forces in the hands of conservatives would be likely to end in a bloodbath. Six months ago, when reformers rose to victory on President Khatami's coattails, capturing a majority of seats in the first round of parliamentary polls, there was great hope that political pluralism could overcome 2,500 years of centralised rule. But today the picture looks very different. The reformist majority in parliament proved to be ineffectual earlier this month, when the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, used his power to kill a proposed bill which would have gone a long way towards reviving the banned press. A press court acted immediately, closing the last major progressive newspaper, Bahar, and jailing more journalists. But even before Ayatollah Khamenei's unprecedented action, leading reformers were already acknowledging that their majority in parliament had vast limitations. \"Being a majority does not necessarily bring power. If we wish to reform everything overnight, then undoubtedly our wishes will not come true,\" Mohammad Reza Khatami, deputy speaker of parliament and brother of the president, told the Guardian on July 21. Holding the presidency, too, has failed to produce the degree of power the reformers had expected. With a mandate of 20m votes, or 70% of the electorate, President Khatami assumed he could implement vast change. But as the leader of the opposition movement who managed to enter the power structure, he has been required to make such compromises with the conservative establishment that he has been reduced to a symbol of Iran's potential. As an intellectual cleric and humanitarian, Mr Khatami holds out the promise that Iran could form an Islamic-style democracy, but that dream is far from being realised. With no control over the armed forces, which in Iran include the police, and little influence within the judiciary, driven primarily by political rather than legal considerations, Mr Khatami has been silenced as conservatives in these institutions trample his loyalists. In times of political crisis, Mr Khatami generally stays out of public view. However, in a speech on Wednesday before the leading student group which helped bring him to power, the president vowed to remain true to the reforms he promised three years go. But he said change must come slowly - an apparent signal that he wanted to avoid confrontation. \"I stand firm on my promises. We ought to have a free climate for expression of views and not betray people's dreams. But I believe there is no other way to reach our goals than through a calm and gradual process,\" said Mr Khatami. Khatami criticised Some reformers criticise the president and other like-minded loyalists for their refusal to confront the conservatives. \"I sat in a room with the leading reformers when the conservatives arrested the first journalist, and I said we must organise protests, we must stop this with force,\" said one leading activist who wished to remain anonymous. \"But the reformers said: 'We can't make trouble now that we are part of the game. We have to cooperate.' And the more they compromised, the more they watched their friends get arrested. Now, all the people who were sitting in that room with me are in jail.\" The conservatives, at first caught off guard by the Khatami onslaught, changed their strategy several months ago and began using all their institutional might to quash the reformers. In the early days of the Khatami presidency, it was primarily Islamic vigilantes who broke up peaceful rallies and beat intellectuals at university lectures. But in recent months, the militant fringe has taken a backseat to powerful conservatives who hold legitimate positions in government. Now, it is hardliners in the judiciary who are eliminating people they call their \"enemies\", rather than shadowy religious extremists with high-level backing. Ayatollah Khamenei, the symbol of the conservative establishment, has decided to move to the forefront, issuing directives that conservatives within the judiciary or law enforcement then follow. The first wave of newspaper closures, for example, came two days after Ayatollah Khamenei declared in April that the reformist papers were \"bases of the enemy\". As his health worsens -he is believed to have prostate cancer - Ayatollah Khamenei appears more determined to secure the conservatives' hold on power before his death. But the price he is paying for the crackdown is immense; he has ceased being a sacred, untouchable public figure. By throwing himself directly into the political fray, he is now the subject of criticism in the way any political figure might be. University students chant slogans against him at rallies. And even more unprecedented, some theologians in the holy Shi'ite city of Qom have dared to distribute leaflets criticising him on theological and political grounds. The main issue driving the conservatives' onslaught is their belief that divine rule has power over the republic. \"Islam was the government of God, not the government of the people,\" said Ayatollah Mohammad Taqi Mesbah-Yazdi, a leading ideologue of the right. They are also reacting to the growing belief in society that clerics should remain outside politics, as they had for centuries. The February parliamentary polls saw fewer clerics elected to office since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, causing alarm in the conservative camp, which subscribes to the belief articulated by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini: \"Those intellectuals who say that the clergy should leave politics and go back to the mosque speak on behalf of Satan.\" In allowing Mohammad Khatami to run for office, the establishment hoped a moderate mullah could save the declining reputation of the clergy. Mr Khatami was selected to show Iran and the world that religious moderation was possible in an Islamic government. But three years on, Mr Khatami and the reformers are at a crossroads. Will the only achievement of their movement, billed as Islam's great Enlightenment, be the freedom women now enjoy to walk city streets wearing open-toed sandals and red lipstick?",

When I joined the staff of Oakham School in 1961, there was a senior member of staff who, whenever the Sunday chapel service featured the psalm in which occur the words: \"The works of His hand are verity and judgment\", could be heard singing, sotto voce, \"The works of His hand are Verity and Sutcliffe\". Dan Howison Oakham, Rutland \u0095 The England cricket team seems to have been doing rather well since it included the three Yorkshire players. Perhaps it would do even better with four. George Kitchin Penrith \u0095 I strongly disagree with the fashionable view that Channel 4's Test match coverage is far superior to that of the BBC. Much of Channel 4's coverage is trivial and irrelevant and Test matches on the BBC invariably last four or five days, rather than these miserable little two or three-day affairs that Channel 4 insists on giving us.

      "body": "<p>Just down the road from the sectarian battleground of Drumcree lurks a collection of bleak, breezeblock laboratories. They house the head office of Galen Holdings - a low profile health care firm which is on the brink of becoming Northern Ireland's first \u00a31bn company. </p> <p>Galen, which was worth just \u00a3180m on flotation three years ago, ended last week with a market capitalisation of \u00a3976m, and the shares are heading upwards. The only other Ulster business to approach the billion mark is the local electricity supplier, Viridian. </p> <p>The driving force behind Galen's success is a little rubber loop - called an intra-vaginal ring. Developed in the company's laboratories in nearby Larne, this has been hyped as the future for drug delivery - particularly for hormone replacement therapy. The ring stays in place for up to three months, gradually releasing medicine, and is considered much more convenient than daily pills or cumbersome surgical implants. </p> <p>The rubber ring has catapulted Galen's management duo, Allen McClay and John King, into the realms of the world's super-rich - their combined 54% stake in the business is worth \u00a3530m. </p> <p>McClay, 67, who founded the company in 1968, is an unlikely pioneer in the field of sexual medicine. Unmarried, he lives in a modest bungalow in Cookstown - the community in which he grew up - with his elderly sister. </p> <p>McClay rarely gives interviews but over lunch, he demonstrates a decent line in homely wisdom, describing Galen's growth as a process of \"building skyscrapers from little bricks\". </p> <p>When the subject of his \u00a3340m paper wealth crops up, McClay insists he has little use for money: \"The Lord gives nuts to those who have no teeth.\" </p> <p>Behind the blarney, locals say McClay hides a highly tuned competitive instinct. One local journalist remarks: \"He may sound like a small-town bumpkin but he's as sharp as nails.\" </p> <p>In fact, McClay has distributed more than \u00a3100m of shares to employees in the business over the years. His own remaining funds are largely invested in charitable trusts, supporting medical research at Queen's University, Belfast, and other academic institutions. </p> <p><strong> Most promising product</strong><br> A former salesman for Glaxo Wellcome, McClay began the business as the province's first drugs group - in the early years, Galen was marketed as \"Galen Holdings, the Northern Irish pharmaceuticals company\". </p> <p>The company has evolved into two distinct divisions - a drugs manufacturing operation and a business providing contract research and development services for other pharmaceuticals groups. </p> <p>Galen's in-house research is limited to drug delivery techniques - the intra-vaginal ring is its most promising product, awaiting the green light from regulators by the end of the year. A second type of product, whereby medicine is absorbed from a patch on the skin, is in the earlier stages of research. </p> <p>Chief executive John King says the strategy has been to develop profitable business with research as a sideline: \"We don't have the resources to be the next Glaxo Wellcome. We have to be very selective in the way we target our research. </p> <p>\"We're not like some biotech companies with no earnings and no profits, depending on one possible multimillion-pound product. Our business doesn't depend on the intra-vaginal ring. We have a core business underneath it.\" </p> <p>King, 50, has been part of the business since 1979 - he was previously a lecturer in the pharmacy department of Queen's University. His stake in Galen is valued at \u00a3190m, and he is the jet-setting half of the management duo, spending half his time in the US and dividing his home life between flats in Belfast and Dublin. </p> <p>Despite Galen's efforts to play down the IVR, it is the key to the company's short-term health. Galen is about to conclude a \u00a3190m takeover of Warner Chilcott, a US pharmaceuticals firm which was largely conceived in order to provide a salesforce for the IVR in the US. </p> <p>The deal will take Galen into the big time on the international drugs scene: it even brings in Bill Gates as a shareholder - he is an investor in Warner Chilcott, and he will have 3% of the combined organisation. McClay says: \"I've never met him. Perhaps he could use some advice.\" </p> <p>The next logical step is to buy a European operation in order to add a continental salesforce.

      "bodyText": "Just down the road from the sectarian battleground of Drumcree lurks a collection of bleak, breezeblock laboratories. They house the head office of Galen Holdings - a low profile health care firm which is on the brink of becoming Northern Ireland's first \u00a31bn company. Galen, which was worth just \u00a3180m on flotation three years ago, ended last week with a market capitalisation of \u00a3976m, and the shares are heading upwards. The only other Ulster business to approach the billion mark is the local electricity supplier, Viridian. The driving force behind Galen's success is a little rubber loop - called an intra-vaginal ring. Developed in the company's laboratories in nearby Larne, this has been hyped as the future for drug delivery - particularly for hormone replacement therapy. The ring stays in place for up to three months, gradually releasing medicine, and is considered much more convenient than daily pills or cumbersome surgical implants. The rubber ring has catapulted Galen's management duo, Allen McClay and John King, into the realms of the world's super-rich - their combined 54% stake in the business is worth \u00a3530m. McClay, 67, who founded the company in 1968, is an unlikely pioneer in the field of sexual medicine. Unmarried, he lives in a modest bungalow in Cookstown - the community in which he grew up - with his elderly sister. McClay rarely gives interviews but over lunch, he demonstrates a decent line in homely wisdom, describing Galen's growth as a process of \"building skyscrapers from little bricks\". When the subject of his \u00a3340m paper wealth crops up, McClay insists he has little use for money: \"The Lord gives nuts to those who have no teeth.\" Behind the blarney, locals say McClay hides a highly tuned competitive instinct. One local journalist remarks: \"He may sound like a small-town bumpkin but he's as sharp as nails.\" In fact, McClay has distributed more than \u00a3100m of shares to employees in the business over the years. His own remaining funds are largely invested in charitable trusts, supporting medical research at Queen's University, Belfast, and other academic institutions. Most promising product A former salesman for Glaxo Wellcome, McClay began the business as the province's first drugs group - in the early years, Galen was marketed as \"Galen Holdings, the Northern Irish pharmaceuticals company\". The company has evolved into two distinct divisions - a drugs manufacturing operation and a business providing contract research and development services for other pharmaceuticals groups. Galen's in-house research is limited to drug delivery techniques - the intra-vaginal ring is its most promising product, awaiting the green light from regulators by the end of the year. A second type of product, whereby medicine is absorbed from a patch on the skin, is in the earlier stages of research. Chief executive John King says the strategy has been to develop profitable business with research as a sideline: \"We don't have the resources to be the next Glaxo Wellcome. We have to be very selective in the way we target our research. \"We're not like some biotech companies with no earnings and no profits, depending on one possible multimillion-pound product. Our business doesn't depend on the intra-vaginal ring. We have a core business underneath it.\" King, 50, has been part of the business since 1979 - he was previously a lecturer in the pharmacy department of Queen's University. His stake in Galen is valued at \u00a3190m, and he is the jet-setting half of the management duo, spending half his time in the US and dividing his home life between flats in Belfast and Dublin. Despite Galen's efforts to play down the IVR, it is the key to the company's short-term health. Galen is about to conclude a \u00a3190m takeover of Warner Chilcott, a US pharmaceuticals firm which was largely conceived in order to provide a salesforce for the IVR in the US. The deal will take Galen into the big time on the international drugs scene: it even brings in Bill Gates as a shareholder - he is an investor in Warner Chilcott, and he will have 3% of the combined organisation. McClay says: \"I've never met him. Perhaps he could use some advice.\" The next logical step is to buy a European operation in order to add a continental salesforce. A proposed \u00a31.5bn merger with a French group, Ferring Pharmaceuticals, collapsed two years ago amid stock market turbulence. King says: \"We're really focused on internationalising the business.\" King and McClay share an office and consult each other on all important decisions. King says: \"He shouts at me. I don't really shout at him.\" After the Warner Chilcott deal, McClay will become non-executive president - although colleagues say there is little doubt that he will continue turning up for work every day. Studies in libido Galen's activities have attracted surprisingly little attention, given their potentially controversial nature in a divided society. The IVR's potential applications include delivering testosterone for increasing the sex drive of menopausal women - effectively, working as a female version of Viagra. The company's researchers have been rounding up Ulster's womenfolk and carrying out detailed studies of their libido. So has the company ever come into conflict with Ulster's puritanical streak? McClay is dismissive: \"I don't know what books you've been reading but Northern Ireland is not a religious society. The conflict here is about politics, not religion.\" What about the followers of the Reverend Ian Paisley? McClay snaps: \"Paisley is a nonentity.\" Galen is very keen to position itself as an apolitical, non-religious organisation, given its position on the outskirts of Drumcree.

Judging by Labour's post-spending review poll readings, they also adore him for pouring so much extra money - \u00a343bn - into key public services. Meanwhile, the economy, Labour's most valuable electoral asset, quietly goes from strength to strength. </p> <p>The Chancellor may be thousands of miles away, canoodling with his wife in Cape Cod, but he could not fail to have been cheered by last week's economic data and their favourable electoral implications. </p> <p>While unemployment fell to 1,070,000 in July, and at this rate will soon dip below the million mark, underlying inflation inflation held steady at 2.2% and wage growth eased from 4.6% to 4.1%, comfortably below the Bank of England's 4.5% speed limit. </p> <p>This at a time when the world economy is experiencing an oil price shock which, in the past, could have been sufficient to plunge it into recession. </p> <p>It's hard to imagine a better platform from which to launch a general election campaign. Whatever the cause of Britain's economic nirvana - skilful handling of macroeconomic policy or good luck or a combination of the two - Mr Brown and the government will take the credit on polling day. No wonder William \"14-pints\" Hague has been driven to drink. With everything going so well, it's natural that exponents of the dismal science should ask: where could it all go wrong? </p> <p>High on the list of disaster scenarios is the US economy going belly-up. It's been so often predicted that people automatically switch off when the subject is mentioned and the most recent data releases, showing accelerating productivity and subdued inflation, certainly give no comfort to the merchants of doom. But the risk of a hard landing caused by an asset price correction remains a very real threat to global and UK economic stability. The new economy may be able to grow much faster and for longer before running into the buffers, but the laws of supply and demand have not been repealed and it can only be a matter of time before the US economy overheats unless the pace of growth moderates soon. </p> <p>The pound also remains a wild card. Fears of meltdown in manufacturing may have receded as some firms learn to live with a strong currency, but anecdotal evidence suggests that there are many more hanging on for dear life. While they own plant in this country and believe that sterling's overvaluation is temporary, manufacturers are likely to carrying on producing their goods even at vastly reduced profit margins, but faced with a new investment decision they may move elsewhere if they can see no respite from the pain they are enduring. </p> <p>The Danish EMU referendum on September 28, if it is lost, could well undermine the euro and give another leg-up to sterling on the foreign exchanges, speeding the flow of job losses in Labour heartlands. While this will not derail the recovery, it could well have electoral implications. Although it will not prompt heartland voters to switch to the Tories, a sense of disillusionment with the government could prompt them to stay at home on polling day, giving the Conservatives seats by default. </p> <p>The down side risks to the economic outlook should not be overplayed. According to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, which has one of the best forecasting records, the chances of a full-blown recession next year are only 3%. The real threat to stability lies in the opposite direction. </p> <p>The Chancellor's public spending plans were formulated on the basis that, after peaking this year, economic growth will gradually slow under the combined weight of the strong pound and four quarter-point interest rate rises since last September. </p> <p>As consumer spending flagged, room would be created for public spending to take up the slack without putting upward pressure on inflation. However, with the autumn approaching, there is no hard evidence that domestic demand is slowing significantly. </p> <p>True, the housing market has come off the boil but it is still robust, and consumer confidence is being underpinned by rising real incomes and rapidly falling unemployment. Consumers are about to receive a fresh boost from a new wave of windfalls flowing from the demutualisation of the Bradford &amp; Bingley building society and various life assurance companies, including Scottish Widows, Friends Provident and Scottish Provident. </p> <p><strong> Spendthrift consumers</strong><br> With nominal interest rates still very low, it's not hard to imagine a scenario in which - far from retrenching - the consumer comes back from his holiday in a spendthrift mood. At the same time the economy's capacity to grow is being tested by buoyant IT-related business investment, albeit confined to the service sector. </p> <p>The optimistic interpretation of last week's figures, the one that is likely to prevail in the short term, is that there has been a dramatic improvement in the trade-off between inflation and unemployment. But the ex-bonus earnings data was less comforting, showing a decline to 4.4% from 4.6%. </p> <p>The pessimists - or should that be realists? - on the Bank of England's monetary policy committee may think the latest earnings data, still subject to uncertainty after the recent overhaul, represents the calm before the storm. While admitting it's possible we really are living in an era where inflation expectations have permanently adjusted downwards, conditioning workers to expect pay rises of between 3% and 4% from here to eternity, the inflation hawks no doubt continue to live in fear of a wage-price spiral. </p> <p>Geoff Dicks, of Royal Bank of Scotland, points out that this year's wage claims were based on headline rates of inflation of less than 2% at the end of 1999. Next year, they will be based on headline rates of between 3% and 4%. The National Institute says a slight pick-up in average earnings growth to about 6% in 2002 can be afforded because it will be paid for out of higher productivity. In this case, labour costs per unit of output will remain under control and not contribute to any significant increase of inflation. But the expected US-style pick-up in productivity growth is not guaranteed. </p> <p>The upshot is that while all seems well on the surface, the economy is actually at a very delicate point in the cycle where events could take a turn for the worse. In the late 1980s Nigel Lawson made the mistake of believing he had performed a miracle, cutting taxes and boosting domestic demand just when least needed. The result was a spectacular boom followed by bust. </p> <p>Mr Brown isn't foolish enough to believe his own publicity, but he has taken a gamble by being so generous on public spending. Although perfectly justifiable on social and economic grounds in the long term, in the short term his largesse could yet contribute to a further round of interest rate rises which would not endear him to homeowners. Borrowing costs won't climb as high as 15%, as they did to control the Lawson boom, but 7% or 8% is perfectly feasible. Voters would not see this as grounds for divorce, but it would spark a few rows between now and polling day. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:mark.atkinson@theguardian.com\">mark.atkinson@theguardian.com</a></p>",

While they own plant in this country and believe that sterling's overvaluation is temporary, manufacturers are likely to carrying on producing their goods even at vastly reduced profit margins, but faced with a new investment decision they may move elsewhere if they can see no respite from the pain they are enduring. The Danish EMU referendum on September 28, if it is lost, could well undermine the euro and give another leg-up to sterling on the foreign exchanges, speeding the flow of job losses in Labour heartlands. While this will not derail the recovery, it could well have electoral implications. Although it will not prompt heartland voters to switch to the Tories, a sense of disillusionment with the government could prompt them to stay at home on polling day, giving the Conservatives seats by default. The down side risks to the economic outlook should not be overplayed. According to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, which has one of the best forecasting records, the chances of a full-blown recession next year are only 3%. The real threat to stability lies in the opposite direction. The Chancellor's public spending plans were formulated on the basis that, after peaking this year, economic growth will gradually slow under the combined weight of the strong pound and four quarter-point interest rate rises since last September. As consumer spending flagged, room would be created for public spending to take up the slack without putting upward pressure on inflation. However, with the autumn approaching, there is no hard evidence that domestic demand is slowing significantly. True, the housing market has come off the boil but it is still robust, and consumer confidence is being underpinned by rising real incomes and rapidly falling unemployment. Consumers are about to receive a fresh boost from a new wave of windfalls flowing from the demutualisation of the Bradford &amp; Bingley building society and various life assurance companies, including Scottish Widows, Friends Provident and Scottish Provident. Spendthrift consumers With nominal interest rates still very low, it's not hard to imagine a scenario in which - far from retrenching - the consumer comes back from his holiday in a spendthrift mood. At the same time the economy's capacity to grow is being tested by buoyant IT-related business investment, albeit confined to the service sector. The optimistic interpretation of last week's figures, the one that is likely to prevail in the short term, is that there has been a dramatic improvement in the trade-off between inflation and unemployment. But the ex-bonus earnings data was less comforting, showing a decline to 4.4% from 4.6%. The pessimists - or should that be realists? - on the Bank of England's monetary policy committee may think the latest earnings data, still subject to uncertainty after the recent overhaul, represents the calm before the storm. While admitting it's possible we really are living in an era where inflation expectations have permanently adjusted downwards, conditioning workers to expect pay rises of between 3% and 4% from here to eternity, the inflation hawks no doubt continue to live in fear of a wage-price spiral. Geoff Dicks, of Royal Bank of Scotland, points out that this year's wage claims were based on headline rates of inflation of less than 2% at the end of 1999. Next year, they will be based on headline rates of between 3% and 4%. The National Institute says a slight pick-up in average earnings growth to about 6% in 2002 can be afforded because it will be paid for out of higher productivity. In this case, labour costs per unit of output will remain under control and not contribute to any significant increase of inflation. But the expected US-style pick-up in productivity growth is not guaranteed. The upshot is that while all seems well on the surface, the economy is actually at a very delicate point in the cycle where events could take a turn for the worse. In the late 1980s Nigel Lawson made the mistake of believing he had performed a miracle, cutting taxes and boosting domestic demand just when least needed. The result was a spectacular boom followed by bust. Mr Brown isn't foolish enough to believe his own publicity, but he has taken a gamble by being so generous on public spending. Although perfectly justifiable on social and economic grounds in the long term, in the short term his largesse could yet contribute to a further round of interest rate rises which would not endear him to homeowners. Borrowing costs won't climb as high as 15%, as they did to control the Lawson boom, but 7% or 8% is perfectly feasible. Voters would not see this as grounds for divorce, but it would spark a few rows between now and polling day. mark.atkinson@theguardian.com",

So how does the international festival now distinguish itself? According to its mission statement, it aims \"to promote and encourage arts of the highest possible standard; to reflect international culture in presentation to Scottish audiences and to reflect Scottish culture in presentation to international audiences; and to bring together a programme of events in an innovative way that cannot easily be achieved by other organisations\". </p> <p>The EIF received \u00a31.9m from Edinburgh City Council and the Scottish Arts Council in 1999, and matched that revenue in ticket sales.

Is Brian McMaster's programming good enough? Under what pressures does a festival director labour? And how should the festival position itself in this new century? </p> <p> <strong> Gavin Henderson </strong></p> <p><strong>Director, Dartington festival</strong> </p> <p> Edinburgh is very much about imported culture. It's not something of which the community feels it has any ownership. Things come to Edinburgh and set up shop: it's a glorified Exchange &amp; Mart of programming. And in Edinburgh, where resources are still not as great as, say, Salzburg, the international festival director has a limited ability to make work from scratch. He's really just a sophisticated magpie popping into his shopping basket a bit of this and a bit of that. Edinburgh does a very limited amount of commissioning, which for me is very disappointing. </p> <p>I feel that a festival should be the antidote to the global culture - that is, where the specific, the local and the very domestic and personal activity happens. It's the jolt in the routine of artistic activity. A festival should bring people up with a start, not with a feeling of: \"Oh, God, they've got that as well, have they?\" </p> <p> <strong> Jonathan Reekie </strong></p> <p><strong>Director, Aldeburgh festival</strong> </p> <p> Festivals are becoming much more global. There's a tendency for large international shows to travel the festival circuit, so a homogeneity is creeping in. One response is to co-produce new work, but that often creates more homogeneity. It would be great if places like Edinburgh did produce more, but we're all working under increasing financial strains and I understand why it might not be able to. I work for a festival that has always been very much defined by its area: by the locality, the people and the culture of Suffolk. Edinburgh is a very special place too. It'd be great to see a stronger sense of the place. </p> <p> <strong> John Drummond </strong></p> <p><strong>Ex-director, Edinburgh festival</strong> </p> <p> The moment came in my time when the bulk of the audience seemed to be local people. Some 70% of our audience back then lived in Scotland. In terms of Brian McMaster's program ming, it's a bit disappointing to see Pierre Boulez, with the London Symphony Orchestra, repeating the concerts he's already done in London. I think it's a little unambitious. We tried in my time not to do things that had been seen in London. On the other hand, there will be people in Edinburgh who won't have heard those concerts. Twenty years ago governments were terribly thrilled with the idea of people coming, and countries like Germany and France were rolling in money. The communist bloc was very keen to send representatives, and very cheaply too. Now that's all gone. </p> <p> <strong> Stella Hall </strong></p> <p><strong>Director, Belfast international festival</strong> </p> <p> A festival needs a number of different ingredients to be successful, and if the ingredients include high-profile artists who are touring other festivals, then great. If your audience can't travel to Australia or New York to see that work, then it's part of your responsibility to bring it to them. Brian has been able to specialise with his programming, and to focus on themes and artists in a way that he may not have done had not the fringe, the jazz and blues and the film festivals been going on alongside. One has to respond to circumstance. I think Brian has put together an excellent programme, and a challenging one. </p> <p> <strong> Kenny Ireland </strong></p> <p><strong>Artistic director, Royal Lyceum</strong> </p> <p> If you programme according to the snob value of the name directors, eventually you'll get their bad production, or a series of bad productions. And then the audiences start thinking: \"Actually, I don't like drama.\" Booking the latest production of Robert Wilson or Zadek for two years hence is a sterile process. You need to be finding what has not yet got a reputation, as well as what has. There's a lot of really good stuff on Brian's doorstep. He, I think, disagrees. Brian has been disparaging about what he sees in Scotland. There is excellence out there and it needs to be managed and brought together. </p> <p> <strong> Lucy Neal </strong></p> <p><strong>London international festival of theatre</strong> </p> <p> The London international festival of theatre questions the notion of a festival director programming the festival's work. By opening up the curatorial role to different cultural viewpoints, decisions as to who are the international circuit's latest stars would give way to a more robust sense of artistic dialogue. Led by the work of artists, festivals can be catalysts for social and political change. They create a framework for people to learn from different cultures and move between them with more confidence. They are an artistic alternative to a world torn by cultural conflict. </p> <p> <strong> Richard Demarco </strong></p> <p><strong>Artist and renowned Edinburgh impresario</strong> </p> <p> The millions the international festival receives from funding bodies should be spread out, firstly to com panies that need to feel they're not left out: companies from countries such as Belarus and Georgia. We talk about international festivals, but these people can't come, because they can't afford it. The festival could go to Sarajevo, Dubrovnik and Tbilisi, and inject its energy into these places. </p> <p>Halfway through this festival we heard reports of horrific things happening in Russia. What's the festival doing about that? Where are the Russian plays? This festival is sick, it's not at ease with itself. We're in danger of destroying one of the most beautiful things Scotland has ever had, a thing that gave it dignity. </p> <p> <strong> Bill Burdett-Coutts </strong></p> <p><strong>Director, Assembly Rooms</strong> </p> <p> The festival has grown up topsy-turvy and the structure needs a rethink. In the public mind, it is one festival, but in fact, it's seven or eight festivals, and they are tugging against each other. It's a shambles. </p> <p>The international festival is quite myopic and I'm not sure it makes any effort to get along with anybody else. I like Brian enormously, but it's not in his nature to go out and embrace other people, and it is the duty and responsibility of the international festival to do that. The comments I hear about the international festival programme are that it's rather dull. Festivals should be about a surge of energy and a bit of magic: the last thing they should be is dull. </p> <p> <strong> Philip Howard </strong></p> <p><strong>Artistic director, Traverse Theatre</strong> </p> <p> What makes some people furious is that the work Brian programmes appears to be inaccessible. Every year the critiques get more savage - \"What is he trying to do to us, making us sit through these nine hours?\" I think he likes winding everybody up, but I also think he has a genuine belief in the integrity of the work. He is a bastion, someone who believes in the right to see that level of work altogether in a festival, in a way that is totally unfashionable. The fact that audiences aren't always huge for some of these pieces may mean that in five years' time we'll no longer get to see such work. I wonder whether his critics might then be saying: \"It's a shame we can't see any of that kind of work any more\". </p> <p> <strong> David Sefton </strong></p> <p><strong>Director of Performing Arts, UCLA</strong> </p> <p> I subscribe to the US presidency model. Festivals should be a reflection of the director's vision, but there should be a finite run for a festival director's term. A healthy model is one that reviews its director's position. I'm just back from Australia, where the Melbourne festival line-up was great. Edinburgh wants to be judged as a world-class festival, but against other festivals it's found wanting. </p> <p>In some cases, it isn't even bringing in the best people any more. It's not innovating. A huge chunk of the Scottish Arts Council's money, not to mention sponsorship and media attention, is concentrated into those three weeks. The responsible way to deal with that is to be good. Edinburgh isn't good enough.</p>",

He is a bastion, someone who believes in the right to see that level of work altogether in a festival, in a way that is totally unfashionable. The fact that audiences aren't always huge for some of these pieces may mean that in five years' time we'll no longer get to see such work. I wonder whether his critics might then be saying: \"It's a shame we can't see any of that kind of work any more\". David Sefton Director of Performing Arts, UCLA I subscribe to the US presidency model. Festivals should be a reflection of the director's vision, but there should be a finite run for a festival director's term. A healthy model is one that reviews its director's position. I'm just back from Australia, where the Melbourne festival line-up was great. Edinburgh wants to be judged as a world-class festival, but against other festivals it's found wanting. In some cases, it isn't even bringing in the best people any more. It's not innovating. A huge chunk of the Scottish Arts Council's money, not to mention sponsorship and media attention, is concentrated into those three weeks. The responsible way to deal with that is to be good. Edinburgh isn't good enough.",

The company's Caf\u00e9 Rouge chain is likely to be slimmed down as part of a review bring carried out by restaurants boss Bill Shannon. Some outlets could be turned into Costa Coffee snack bars. Mr Thomas is under pressure to reverse Whitbread's declining share price - speculation about his future has intensified over the last month, since the appointment of former Thomson Travel boss Charles Gurassa as a non-executive director. Mr Gurassa is ambitious - he lost his job when Thomson was taken over, and he has been tipped as a future chief executive of Whitbread. Analysts believe that Mr Thomas may soon choose to step down. He was widely criticised last summer, when the group's \u00a32.7bn bid for Allied Domecq's pubs failed.",

Certainly it has been no Compton-Edrich golden summer of '47, or anything like the Brearley years of triumph: '76, '77, '80, '82 and '85. </p> <p>But, says Gatting, 'It's the rain, really.

And Gatting has seen his share of rainy days. </p> <p>He is one of the few England captains to go 10 Tests without a half-century, but he fought back, beating the bowlers if not the suits at HQ, who took the captaincy off him for nocturnal activities that had nothing to do with cricket and fined him for his candour in a ghosted book that said what he thought about the Pakistani umpire Shakoor Rana. </p> <p>He was taken off Duncan Fletcher's England selection panel last season - although he still coaches the under 19 and A teams - and it was no pain for him to turn his attention to Middlesex, where he has played since turning up at Lord's from the Brondesbury club in north London as a brilliant teenager in 1975. </p> <p>It is hard to recollect the buzz that surrounded his arrival that summer. His shape and style dictated he would always be characterised as pugnacious, and so he was in the course of 14 years as Middlesex captain, as well as 79 Tests and 98 one-day internationals for England. In one glorious patch, he led England to the Ashes in Australia and when he got back, was summoned to Buckingham Palace to receive an OBE - which only just nudged off the Gatting mantelpiece the bronze medal he got for ballroom dancing at the Neasden Ritz. </p> <p>He was always an interesting cricketer, was Gatting: the first real working class captain of England, a part-time plumber, a lover of Beethoven, Holst and Elton John (their music, you understand), a good schoolboy goalkeeper who might have played for Watford... and then a beknighted leader of the unhappy rebel tour to South Africa, which he paid for with a five-year ban, rescinded in 1992. While banished, Gatting got immense pleasure from winning the county championship in 1990, and did it again in '93. Only Patsy Hendren scored more runs for the county. So what does this proud man of Middlesex make of their present mess? </p> <p>'We've got a good squad. We're getting there and you've got to hold it together. But is the season a wash-out? I hope not.

      "bodyText": "'We had been through a gruelling two-and-a-half week training programme with our new fitness team, Chris St George, Al and Kerry, but this was broken up with a trip to our new sponsor Equitable Life's head office in Aylesbury to meet their staff, and then we had the pre-season dinner, which all went very well.' It is comforting to note that, after years of dedicated scoffing, Mike Gatting has not lost sight of life's simple pleasures. However, since the Middlesex director of coaching made the above observations on the club's website just before they left on a pre-season trip to South Africa, reality has kicked in like a bad pork pie. Middlesex went into their latest match against Warwickshire on Thursday lying second last in division two of the championship, yet Gatting's combative spirit prevents him agreeing that this might be one of the most miserable seasons in the history of a club formed 136 years ago. Certainly it has been no Compton-Edrich golden summer of '47, or anything like the Brearley years of triumph: '76, '77, '80, '82 and '85. But, says Gatting, 'It's the rain, really. Some people have managed to win games when they haven't had the rain; some people, like us, have got done by the rain a couple of times... plus, the fact is, yes, we've played poorly once or twice, I have to say that. The games we've looked like winning have been rained off, unfortunately; and the games where we've played badly, the weather's been good.' There is not a professional athlete breathing who can rationalise a poor run of form like a county cricketer moving through an English summer under a permanent cloud. And Gatting has seen his share of rainy days. He is one of the few England captains to go 10 Tests without a half-century, but he fought back, beating the bowlers if not the suits at HQ, who took the captaincy off him for nocturnal activities that had nothing to do with cricket and fined him for his candour in a ghosted book that said what he thought about the Pakistani umpire Shakoor Rana. He was taken off Duncan Fletcher's England selection panel last season - although he still coaches the under 19 and A teams - and it was no pain for him to turn his attention to Middlesex, where he has played since turning up at Lord's from the Brondesbury club in north London as a brilliant teenager in 1975. It is hard to recollect the buzz that surrounded his arrival that summer.

The nation, apart from ticketholders for Saturday and Sunday, rejoiced. </p> <p>There may also have been one or two quiet reservations in the offices of the county grounds of England. There they might be calculating the loss of revenue from another truncated Test match. For the third time this summer at least half a million pounds has gone begging; the optimists tell us that this might all be recouped as potential sponsors, contemplating taking the place of Cornhill Insurance, are seduced by the prospect of a successful England side. </p> <p>Moreover those counties anxious to have their England stars in their side to ensure promotion or the avoidance of relegation received another setback. For this victory seemed to vindicate the introduction of centrally contracted players and their reduced work load. </p> <p>I should declare an interest here. As a Somerset committee man I recognise that it is vital to have Andrew Caddick - and Marcus Trescothick - in the county team to ensure success. It so happened that on Friday I was chatting to the fourth selector, Geoff Miller, when Caddick, still wicketless in the game, was shifted to the Rugby Stand End. As is my wont in this sort of company I murmured that 'Caddick has looked a bit rusty in this match'. Whereupon he bowled that over: four wickets in the space of seven deliveries (there was a no-ball). Miller did not feel it necessary to respond. </p> <p>The advent of central contracts has changed the lifestyle of Caddick more than any other of the England cricketers. There has always been the notion, clung to by Somerset committee men, that he is the type of cricketer who thrives on bowling. Last summer, when he made a suc cessful return to the England side, he bowled 763 first class overs. So far this year he has bowled 290. He may end the season having delivered less than 350. And after Friday it is tricky to argue that his potency has been reduced. </p> <p>If England keep winning we cannot argue with a new system, which requires our top players to develop a new discipline. In the wake of another fine England performance Duncan Fletcher could whisk his charges off to the Algarve for a week in the middle of August and no one could complain too much. The players are learning to prepare themselves for key games without playing domestic cricket. </p> <p>This new discipline should help them on tour. Away from home England cricketers have often felt starved of cricket. Denied the rhythm of the English county season the batsmen especially have often felt short of time in the middle, while the bowlers have had to sharpen their game in the nets, not their natural habitat. They are now learning to do this in England while the risk of injury from overbowling in county cricket has been reduced. </p> <p>However the new system is not perfect. It is still important to retain the integrity of domestic cricket. Duncan Fletcher has announced that those players selected for both Test and one day cricket on the winter tours will not be allowed to play for their counties as the season in its new format, with all the anticipated thrills of promotion and relegation, reaches its climax. This is highly unsatisfactory. </p> <p>The ECB claim that this is a one-off situation, that the trip to Nairobi for the mini World Cup - the players leave on September 29 - is unlikely to be repeated. It is imperative that they ensure that this really is the case. In the future they have to insist that England should not have any winter commitments until the end of October. In this way the contracted players would be able to participate in the finale to the English county season season, thereby raising the profile of a domestic game, which is in danger of being swamped by international cricket. </p> <p>There have been other teething problems. The elevation of Chris Schofield to central contract status was always going to be a mistake and that has now been acknowledged. In hindsight the contracts given to Dean Headley and Mark Ramprakash were also a waste. </p> <p>However on balance the selectors have to be held in unusually high esteem at the moment. Their surprising decision to offer Craig White a contract has been justified. This gave a diffident man new faith in himself. They have also plucked out two batsmen for the future, Michael Vaughan and Marcus Trescothick, and their reading of the Headingley pitch, which resulted in the recall of Graeme Hick at number seven, was spot on. </p> <p>Jimmy Adams in a dignified press conference after a desolate West Indian performance refused to complain about the pitch and it was loyally defended by Darren Gough. </p> <p>But it was inadequate for Test cricket, a fact which Nasser Hussain was realistic enough to concede. It is absurd that Yorkshire should proudly tell us of a \u00a310million revamp of Headingley, incorporating plush new stands when the most fundamental element of any cricket arena - the square - remains sub-standard. Most Test matches should last five days; this summer four of the six have yet to make it to Monday, which should temper some of the euphoria of an English victory at the ECB. </p> <p>We anticipate something better at the Oval, the venue for the final Test of the summer. There the ball has turned consistently this summer, a fact that will be the only source of agonising for the England selectors in the next week. They will be reluctant to change this side since it is mighty difficult to work out who should be omitted to make way for a spinner. They can't leave out their most run-shy batsman, Hussain, since he's the captain and any suggestions along that line will only come from mischievous hacks. After Headingley they will be reluctant to leave out Hick. </p> <p>Given Robert Croft's lack of success on a slow turner at Old Trafford, they will only want to play a spinner if they are convinced that the ball will turn prodigiously. Rather than go for an out and out specialist like the ageing Phil Tufnell or Peter Such they may consider Ashley Giles for his all-round skills. They would rather that the Oval produced a benign non-turner. </p> <p>However these problems are pinpricks compared to those facing the West Indies. Their support bowlers have had their confidence shredded; their batting line-up can collapse as rapidly as any England side in recent history. Viv Richards, his pride hurt, spoke on Friday of his attempts to persuade Ambrose and Walsh to keep going for their daunting trip to Australia this winter just to keep the ship afloat. Jimmy Adams despaired of his side's inconsistency: 'Being able to spark now and again won't cut at this level.' </p> <p>How often have we heard England captains express the same sentiments in recent times.

The world's number one, a man not short of a word or two, was silent as he stood for some time at the start of his run, apparently unable to comprehend what he saw. </p> <p>The batsman was standing outside leg stump, showing him all three stumps. Was it a wind up? The famous McGrath head-shaking very nearly started before he bowled the ball. </p> <p>Warwickshire's bowlers at Lord's next Saturday will not be so bemused, for Barnett has been employing his strange method for some time in the county game. The likes of Allan Donald and Ed Giddins - assuming they are fit - may even try to ignore the progressive steps that Barnett takes across his crease, erase the thought that they are bowling at a moving target, and instead concentrate instead on bowling to a batsman who, like most others, is in front of his middle and off stumps as he is playing the ball. </p> <p>Since Warwickshire's coach is Bob Woolmer, mind games as well as tactics may prove the key to a fascinating 2000 NatWest final. Certainly Barnett, now in his fifth consecutive final, has got the innings well launched in all of his previous four appearances. In the 1998 NatWest, with Derbyshire, the Barnett-Slater stand was 70 - too bad that a Lancashire torpedo hit Derbyshire after that. In last year's two victories for Gloucestershire, Barnett hit 28 and 49 in stands worth 66 and 125. Two months ago in the B&amp;H it was 39 in a stand of 80. </p> <p>So the lesson is: don't mistake eccentricity for a weak point. There was a technical reason, says Barnett, for the method he adopted many years ago. 'A few old pros said I couldn't get away with the way I was playing. I was too leg-side of the ball and too back-foot. So I had to change. And I changed immediately.' </p> <p>It wasn't in his mind to unsettle bowlers, but that is now regarded as an asset by a Gloucestershire management strong on fresh, imaginative thinking. </p> <p>Indeed, the 40-year-old Barnett is probably out-thinking the bowlers. He does his homework, he says, and takes a lot of thought into games. 'I try different things. I think that's the essence of batting, really. You've got to take into account different opponents. I would think that every innings I do a few things differently.' </p> <p>This is an attitude which very much fits with that of coach John Bracewell, who says: 'A good player should be thinking, \"How many shots can I play on this wicket, in these conditions, against this bowler?\" That's why we got Kim. He's a tactical player, not a technical player. There's not enough of them.' </p> <p>Actually, Gloucestershire do have a few more. Like Ian Harvey, the Australian and Jack Russell, whose batting style is almost as odd as Barnett's. </p> <p>Then there's the fielding. Under Bracewell, Gloucestershire have raised it to a new level, with fielders mentally geared to attacking the batsman rather than reacting to him. 'I've had to work hard to keep up with these boys,' says Barnett, 'even if they do have to hide me to some degree. It's the best fielding side I've ever seen. Against Lancashire in the semi-final there was a half-hour that made you think of the Harlem Globetrotters.'</p>",

It was the 47th century of his career and his 10th for Yorkshire, and came on a final day when rain held up play until 2.30pm. Yorkshire, who resumed on 194 for five, were eventually all out for 340. They picked up 10 points to stay in second place in the Championship while Leicestershire's 11 points mean they stay in fourth place.",

These pitches sort the sheep from the goats when it comes to batting - as well as those blessed with good fortune and those not. One Test is whether, after facing three or four balls that move sharply or lift, a batsman has the confidence and poise to remain positive and balanced for the rare loose one. </p> <p>For England, Thorpe and Vaughan in particular showed this quality here at Headingley, Atherton and Trescothick earlier in the year; for West Indies only Sarwan managed it here. To see just two batsmen glorying in their art was, over the series of Tests, as rare a sighting as seeing the lesser spotted woodpecker: the cricket watcher needed to be at Old Trafford to be reminded of this aspect of the game by Lara's and Stewart's masterly innings. </p> <p>At Headingley the cricket has been absorbing, of course, especially for the home crowd. But it is not good enough. The dice are loaded too heavily against the batsman. Fast bowlers are flattered, slow ones surplus to requirements. Top-class batsmen can be reduced to missing the ball by two bats' width. And what about the thousands who booked up for their Saturday at the Test? </p> <p>West Indies lost this game, like the one at Lord's, primarily in one department - in their support bowling. Every England innings of the series has had two phases; the first when it looked near-impossible to score a run, and survival was precarious; the second when any two of King, Rose and McLean were on. </p> <p>Now Bishop's dictum had a different implication - it suddenly became hard to imagine a ball being straight not in the sense of being undeviating, but in being bowled on the stumps. On Friday, for the first time in my cricketing life, I felt sorry for a West Indies fast bowler. Reon King is clearly a bowler of potential, regularly managing 88-90 mph, with a low, skiddy outswing shape. Yet on a pitch on which accuracy was at a premium, he bowled a series of deliveries that were embarrassingly wide. He kept his dignity, fielded with dash while all around his team were falling to pieces, yet inside he must have felt like a small boy shamed in front of the whole school. </p> <p>England by contrast look a proper team, without glaring weaknesses. Gough seems back to his old best, or better. He uses his brain now, as well as his body. He has long been able to swing the new ball out and the old one in, at a slippery pace. </p> <p>At times, however, he has in the past felt the onus of a weak attack too much on his shoulders, ending up ragged as a result of trying to do other people's jobs as well as his own. </p> <p>Now he is properly supported, and can do his own thing, knowing that others will play their proper parts. England have at present a full range of quickish bowlers. Caddick for instance is a bowler who comes down from a height, with steeper bounce, while Gough's bounce is skimmy. While Gough has variety, Caddick at his best is relentless. Like Gough, Cork has grown cannier with age, giving away fewer runs on occasions when the ball doesn't swing; he is slower than Gough, and swings the ball more. And White has been the bowling find of the summer, bowling with speed and hostility whether in one-day matches or Tests. </p> <p>What's more, the catching has been excellent, especially with Hick in the side. With Thorpe back alongside him the slip cordon looks as menacing and confident as an Australian one. </p> <p>What also impresses me is the thinking that has gone into selection and tactics. Before the event I applauded both the selection for this Test match - seven batsmen and four bowlers, and the use of a nightwatchman, despite the fact that this meant Hick going in at number eight. Even Caddick's 20 minutes at the crease on Friday morning served the purpose of limiting the time that Hick would have to face the combined A-team of Ambrose and Walsh. </p> <p>I applauded too the selection of Thorpe for the last Test and this: his innings here was even classier than Vaughan's, since it was made against the two great bowlers with their tails up and a new ball in their hands. Hussain himself played a vital part; his 22, made when out of form and up against it, exuded sheer determination and pluck. Had either gone early England could have had a first innings deficit rather than the comfortable lead. </p> <p>I could mention other decisions that were taken within the match on the basis of feel for the situation rather than by rote. Here are two. One was Hussain's giving White so many overs in the first innings. It can take courage to believe your eyes as captain, and recognise the superiority, on his day, of someone who has generally been lower in the pecking order. </p> <p>I remember how reluctant I was, on a tour of Australia, to give full credence to the fact that Hendrick, earmarked as a likely reserve, was actually performing as our best bowler. It even took a casual comment from one of our state opponents to convince me. This year someone has spotted White's qualities and given him the confidence to express himself. </p> <p>My other example was the use of Caddick in the second innings. When Gough was taken off after his devastating spell, the routine decision, after the first innings, would have been to give the ball to White. Instead Caddick was brought on to bowl up the hill for the first time in the match. Here Hussain acknowledged, perhaps, both that Caddick was still likely to swing the ball out, and that he might bang the ball in to the pitch harder, from his height, when running up the hill. </p> <p>One final comment. In this match England have made use off all their assets - including the less glamorous one of harrying and scuttling their opponents between the wickets. During the crucial period when England surged from 96-5 to 272 all out, Caddick, Hick, Cork and above all, cool-head Vaughan used this ploy first to gain momentum and in the end to rattle the West Indies in the field. This was the cricket of a team willing to hustle and fight for each other. </p> <p>Such a team suggests good leadership, both on and off the field. And in his brief post-match interviews, following the modest Hussain, Duncan Fletcher's taciturn bluntness was massively reassuring.</p>",

For one thing, the sound waves created by contact with bat edge and pad need skilled interpretation, and one may come very close to the other. </p> <p>But there have been a number of episodes in which the conclusion of the Snicko has defied all other evidence - including that of the batsman himself. And last Monday's NatWest semi-final at Bristol featured a particularly uneven performance by the funny sound waves. </p> <p>When Gloucestershire's Kim Barnett slashed at a wide ball in the first over, all the Lancashire players seemed sure he had got a thin top edge - not given by the umpire, who instead signalled a wide. Commentators studying the replay came to the same conclusion as unhappy Lancashire. But the Snicko's reading, when it arrived, surprisingly showed no contact. </p> <p>Later in the day the data - video matched to sound - was run again. This time it registered a clearcut snick, and that is what Channel 4 showed in their highlights programme. Invited to comment, a spokesman could say only: 'We've always said [the Snickometer] isn't an exact science.' But surely it has to be, if there is to be any point in it? </p> <p>In recent years, Warwickshire have had an over-50s team who were the envy of all their opponents in this hotly contested annual competition. The senior Bears boasted Alan Oakman, John Jameson and Eddie Hemmings, all former England players, and also the little master of Pakistan and Northamptonshire, Mushtaq Mohammad. </p> <p>Now, only Mushy remains. The durable Oakman has finally retired at 70. And it hasn't been possible to recruit Dennis Amiss, now Edgbaston's chief executive. But the biggest blow for the Warwickshire over-50s is a failure to locate Alvin Kallicharran when the former West Indies left-hander reached the qualifying age last year. </p> <p>To the chagrin of the Bears, Kalli has emerged this year in Middlesex colours - and is starring for them. His four innings have produced two centuries, a 70 and, most recently, 63. Only a controversial run-out decision ended that innings, but it didn't stop Middlesex from qualifying for the quarter-finals. Kalli and co play Devon today. </p> <p>*****</p> <p>Indifferent light may still terrify professional cricketers, but these days they're not half so bothered by slipping and sliding. As the new laws of cricket boldly state: 'Merely because the grass and the ball are wet and slippery does not warrant the conditions being considered unreasonable or dangerous.' </p> <p>The new attitude was dramatically illustrated at Old Trafford last week when an abbreviated day-night match was played with surface water in one corner - water into which Kent's Martin Saggers aquaplaned for several metres with an attempted boundary save. </p> <p>It is said that even in the championship captains and umpires will agree to play if outfield puddles are at least 35 metres from the stumps. </p> <p>*****</p> <p>Warwickshire's enthusiasm for floodlit matches may be waning. </p> <p>Following modest attendances of around 4,000 - much the same as on Sundays - and criticism of the strength of the temporary lighting, they've now had their application for permanent lights turned down. Birmingham's chief planning officer cites light spillage, noise and traffic. </p> <p>Warwickshire must now decide whether to appeal to the High Court, continue with costly hiring of lights - or give up on night cricket.</p>",

Commentators studying the replay came to the same conclusion as unhappy Lancashire. But the Snicko's reading, when it arrived, surprisingly showed no contact. Later in the day the data - video matched to sound - was run again. This time it registered a clearcut snick, and that is what Channel 4 showed in their highlights programme. Invited to comment, a spokesman could say only: 'We've always said [the Snickometer] isn't an exact science.' But surely it has to be, if there is to be any point in it? In recent years, Warwickshire have had an over-50s team who were the envy of all their opponents in this hotly contested annual competition. The senior Bears boasted Alan Oakman, John Jameson and Eddie Hemmings, all former England players, and also the little master of Pakistan and Northamptonshire, Mushtaq Mohammad. Now, only Mushy remains. The durable Oakman has finally retired at 70. And it hasn't been possible to recruit Dennis Amiss, now Edgbaston's chief executive. But the biggest blow for the Warwickshire over-50s is a failure to locate Alvin Kallicharran when the former West Indies left-hander reached the qualifying age last year. To the chagrin of the Bears, Kalli has emerged this year in Middlesex colours - and is starring for them. His four innings have produced two centuries, a 70 and, most recently, 63. Only a controversial run-out decision ended that innings, but it didn't stop Middlesex from qualifying for the quarter-finals. Kalli and co play Devon today. ***** Indifferent light may still terrify professional cricketers, but these days they're not half so bothered by slipping and sliding. As the new laws of cricket boldly state: 'Merely because the grass and the ball are wet and slippery does not warrant the conditions being considered unreasonable or dangerous.' The new attitude was dramatically illustrated at Old Trafford last week when an abbreviated day-night match was played with surface water in one corner - water into which Kent's Martin Saggers aquaplaned for several metres with an attempted boundary save. It is said that even in the championship captains and umpires will agree to play if outfield puddles are at least 35 metres from the stumps. ***** Warwickshire's enthusiasm for floodlit matches may be waning. Following modest attendances of around 4,000 - much the same as on Sundays - and criticism of the strength of the temporary lighting, they've now had their application for permanent lights turned down. Birmingham's chief planning officer cites light spillage, noise and traffic. Warwickshire must now decide whether to appeal to the High Court, continue with costly hiring of lights - or give up on night cricket.",

They are dressed in perfectly pressed suits. But it's not fado until the proud, slightly plump lady sings. </p> <p>Every muscle in her neck moves as she lets rip. Her haunting voice is on the melancholy side of flamenco. Think Edith Piaf on downers and you're halfway there. A heavy earnestness and respectful silence fill the air. If I make a noise, I think I'm going to be thrown out. Grin and I will be lynched. Certainly a smile from any of the musicians is likely to break a clause in their contract. Like poets, fado singers use few words to express a lot of emotion. Performances are short because it's so intense. There's such deep feeling that after a few songs she is sweating. </p> <p>Fado is taken so seriously because you've tapped into the deep expression of the Portuguese soul. You're in the presence of absence, where an innate melancholy reigns. These are songs born in the hearts of homesick sailors adrift on uncharted seas. From the time when ships sailed abroad and didn't come back. It's a longing for something that's gone and this sadness keeps them happy. </p> <p>When Portugal's greatest fadista, Amalia Rodrigues, died in October 1999, there was an enormous outpouring of public grief and three days' national mourning. 'I never cry, but I cried the day Amalia died,' says my waiter, Luis. 'She was our Princess Diana. People liked her because she was natural, she didn't pretend to be important. She never lost her common touch.' </p> <p>Amalia would certainly approve of Lisbon's latest festival, a week of nightly concerts and exhibitions celebrating fado. And, like the great Portuguese explorers, the festival will cross the oceans and explore fado's links with similar musical forms, such as the mornas from the Cape Verde Islands, the tango of Buenos Aires, Cajun music from New Orleans, flamenco from Andalucia and rembetika, the Greek blues born in the ports of Piraeus and Salonika at the start of the twentieth century. </p> <p>Like fado, all these musical styles sprang from the poorest levels of society to become cultural emblems of their countries. Bittersweet anthems of longing that draw inspiration from common themes of fate, love and destiny. The music reflects a difficult, hard and often sad life. Life has always revolved around the sea in Lisbon. The celebrated Portuguese poet, Fernando Pessoa, wrote that every pier is a longing of stone. He was right. Ports breed sadness, but also cultural interchanges. </p> <p>The origins of fado are hotly contested. Some swear it was born of Gypsies or Arabs, while others theorise it may have been the musical longings of African slaves, freighted to Brazil. It is the small hours before I finally emerge from the fado house. The narrow, cobbled streets of the Bairro Alto (Upper Quarter) are now amok with hundreds of good-natured young Lisboetas . Virtually every doorway is some kind of bar. Late nights are an essential part of Lisbon, but you pay a price. </p> <p>In the morning, weary from lack of sleep, I take the Edwardian tramline to the hilly, mediaeval streets of Alfama, Lisbon's Moorish quarter. Fado emerged from these streets in the eighteen-thirties among people in poorly paid jobs often connected with the sea. Originally the music was associated with prostitution and Bohemian life.Only in the late nineteenth century did fado enter aristocratic circles. </p> <p>You sense that Alfama is a close community that looks out for its own. But what else would you expect from what is in essence a fishing community? You meet the eyes of proud, old men in flat caps and cardigans, but their half-smiles hint at a terrible foreboding. Dignified old ladies with kind faces watch from their balconies. Every face tells a story, of personal sorrows, of a longing for something out of reach. </p> <p>At the foot of Alfama, the House of Fado and Portuguese Guitar documents the history and roots of Lisbon's own music. Not bad for a former city water supply pumping station. </p> <p>In a caf\u00e9, elderly men crowd around a flimsy table. They slam playing cards down with such ferocity you think the table will collapse. Behind the counter a barman looks on quietly, torn between the action and the pages of a novel.

      "bodyText": "When I was a child you couldn't really go abroad because abroad was full of Nazis. Some of my first holidays were being evacuated. Once was to a village in Devon called Beer. There were no tourists and obviously I wasn't very happy because I was away from home. But you could walk along the beach and collect, on a pointed stick, all the dabs and plaice that the fishermen threw out. You would pay them sixpence. I think that started a lifelong interest in eating fish - I still hang around fish shops. My first real holiday was when I was at secondary school. We went camping on the edge of Romney Marsh and I have loved marshes ever since: the smell of the mud, the cries of the birds and the boats. You feel as if you are looking at an infinite horizon.

The town has strong historical ties to hardline loyalism dating back to 1912, when the original Ulster Volunteer Force landed 30,000 rifles from the Clyde valley to arm people willing violently to resist Home Rule in Ireland. The windows of the office, above butchers' shop in Main Street, are bullet proof.

And then, when that gun attack happened, one of them was dead, wrapped in a blanket that barely covered him.

I remember Hume breaking down in tears and that's when I knew I had to join the party,' he said.</p> <p>Like many SDLP representatives living in mainly loyalist areas, O'Connor paid the price for entering politics. Some of the party's early leaders were victims of both loyalist and republican intimidation. Austin Currie, now a Fine Gael TD in Dublin, suffered attacks from the UVF and the IRA. Loyalists bombed Seamus Mallon's home. Former leader Gerry Fitt had to force an IRA-inspired mob out of his house at gunpoint after they broke into his home threatening him and his family. As he waved his legally-held gun at the intruders, one of them shouted: 'Look, he's a coward, he's got a gun.' Worst of all Lord Fitt's friend Senator Paddy Wilson and his friend Irene Andrews were stabbed to death in a frenzied knife attack.</p> <p>O'Connor accepted the risks of being a nationalist representative in a loyalist stronghold. 'The first cases I dealt with were Catholic constituents being burnt out of their homes. The people I represent are under attack and that means I have to stand firm and keep going.'</p> <p>He blames the East Antrim UDA for orchestrating most of the violence directed against him, his family and his constituents. The RUC have told him he is on a loyalist death list. Yet he has founded the first branch of the SDLP in Larne and predicts that the party will elect more councillors to the local borough council next May.</p> <p>West of the Bann, the party is fighting a rearguard struggle against a highly organised, disciplined and well-financed Sinn Fein. In Westminster constituencies such as West Tyrone, it is Sinn Fein rather than the SDLP which is seen as the main challenger to the sitting Unionist MPs. But east of the river dividing Northern Ireland, John Hume's party is clearly making inroads into the Alliance vote and gaining fresh support from the new Catholic middle-class emerging in areas that were once 100 per cent unionist.</p> <p>Optimistically, O'Connor dismisses the prophets of doom who predict the demise of the SDLP and the further rise of Sinn Fein.</p> <p>'The Agreement was pure SDLP politics in practice, compromise and common sense. They've been arguing for a settlement like this for 30 years long before Sinn Fein started to get into real politics. Unlike Sinn Fein I can reach out to others beyond nationalism, to people from Unionist and Alliance backgrounds that voted for the Agreement. All republican violence achieved over 25 years was to drive people further apart.'</p>",

The people I represent are under attack and that means I have to stand firm and keep going.' He blames the East Antrim UDA for orchestrating most of the violence directed against him, his family and his constituents. The RUC have told him he is on a loyalist death list. Yet he has founded the first branch of the SDLP in Larne and predicts that the party will elect more councillors to the local borough council next May. West of the Bann, the party is fighting a rearguard struggle against a highly organised, disciplined and well-financed Sinn Fein. In Westminster constituencies such as West Tyrone, it is Sinn Fein rather than the SDLP which is seen as the main challenger to the sitting Unionist MPs. But east of the river dividing Northern Ireland, John Hume's party is clearly making inroads into the Alliance vote and gaining fresh support from the new Catholic middle-class emerging in areas that were once 100 per cent unionist. Optimistically, O'Connor dismisses the prophets of doom who predict the demise of the SDLP and the further rise of Sinn Fein. 'The Agreement was pure SDLP politics in practice, compromise and common sense. They've been arguing for a settlement like this for 30 years long before Sinn Fein started to get into real politics. Unlike Sinn Fein I can reach out to others beyond nationalism, to people from Unionist and Alliance backgrounds that voted for the Agreement. All republican violence achieved over 25 years was to drive people further apart.'",

At roughly 4,000m above sea-level you're confronted by a glorious trinity of mountain, valley and brilliant blue sky. It's enough to take your breath away. But the exertion of getting there has probably done that already. Of course, the pay-off is striking. </p> <p>It's easy to forget the views that persuade thousands of travellers to test their limbs and resolve each year are commonplace to the inhabitants of the mountain kingdom. As you trek through the hills, you constantly encounter nonplussed locals. This extraordinary locale has provided the inspiration for a new film reminiscent in scale and content of a John Ford western. Set in the Dolpo region of the north-western Himalayas, Himalaya is the tale of an epic journey from a village deep in the Nepalese Himalayas down to the lush valleys. The yak caravan undertakes this hazardous journey in order to swap their salt reserves for precious grain. It's a relentless trek blessed, literally, by the gods. </p> <p>The Dolpo region is one of the most isolated and highest areas of the Himalayas, fiercely protected by natural barriers, almost a hidden country. If you want to experience the trekking life without that kind of struggle, best head towards more hospitable hills. </p> <p>The most popular trek for keen walkers is the Annapurna circuit across the north Himalayan range, which takes three weeks to cross, including a 5,416m pass. For a gentler introduction, I embarked on the Jomson trek, basically the last third of Annapurna circuit. Tourism accounts for 16 per cent of Nepal's GDP, but up in the hills it's often the main source of income. The region is traditionally populated with tenant and subsistence farmers. Post-war mountaineers spoke of the area's beauty and since the Sixties it has become a hot destination for adventurous sun seekers. </p> <p>Trekking is a Nepalese way of life; there are few reliable roads at altitude so you will see plenty of villagers along the way. Modern technology has left the region largely alone. The electricity supply is solar powered. The main signs of Western influence are the number of Nepalese men clad in brands such as Nike, Reebok and Adidas. Most impressive are the Herculean feats of those carrying heavy loads, ranging from man-sized bundles to 12ft slabs of building timber. I had been warned that the monsoon period, from June to September, brings slippery slopes and wet socks. So I came prepared, over-prepared. I'd bought my boots and jacket in Kathmandu for a third of the British price. From there I flew to the staging town of Pokhara, home to Nepal's equivalent of the hippie trail. Restaurants have names such as Chill Out and Ganga and the nightlife is vibrant. But I stepped out of the light aircraft into blazing sunshine. </p> <p>'It's just like the desert,' says my personal guide Roshan. Born in neighbouring Bhutan, Roshan went to school in Kathmandu and stayed. During the off-season he has an enforced four-month break without pay so looks forward to October. It obviously hasn't rained here for some time and, according to Roshan, it seldom does. Ironically, flying to Jomson from Pokhara I had seen rows of green, fertile hills covered in trees, while the tiers of paddy fields made much of the landscape look strangely wrinkled. </p> <p>From a clear day on the higher levels of the Jomson trail you can see Everest. The trail, which from October will be teeming, was quiet. During the trip I saw few other travellers. When the plane arrived, porters and guides lined up to greet their prospective employers. The runway marks the end of the long street which is the village's sole thoroughfare. Apart from the activity around the runway, Jomson (2,713m) looked like a Mexican border town; gift shops and teahouses - essentially backpacking hostels - lined the rugged road. Mountain people are stoic and philosophical. When my 30-minute flight was delayed by mist over Jomson for two and a half hours, there were no complaints in the departure lounge. As we waited on the runway to board the return flight, Roshan calmly told me that Nepalese light aircraft have an unenviable safety record. Indeed he fortuitously missed a plane last year, which was later involved in a fatal crash. </p> <p>The trekking day begins around 6am and ends around 4pm. We arrived at lunch time, too late to do a proper day's walking. Roshan hired a porter and I watched guiltily as he hoisted my holdall on to his shoulder. We headed towards Marpha, a tiny village famous for apples. The views were breathtaking from the valley floor; there was a harsh beauty to the arid landscape beneath the impressive cloudless sky. Our first journey was punctuated by my camera stops. </p> <p>I realised later that the two-hour trek to Marpha has been a relative stroll, consisting of a few short descents and ascents, but essentially flat. The main attraction at Marpha (2,665m) is the apple brandy distillery. It's a favourite destination for thirsty trekkers who are allowed to taste the product during guided tours. This is hard stuff, 75 per cent proof, and it tastes like it should be on a paintbrush rather than my tongue. Still, I bought a couple of bottles for 50 rupees each (about 50p). Emboldened by the earlier walk, I persuaded Roshan to lead me up the hill to large white-and-brown dyed rock surrounded by multi-coloured flags. It is the sign that Buddhists live here. It was a short, arduous trek for a humble beginner. Roshan strode ahead and I scrambled up in his wake. At the top I breathlessly flopped on to a large rock. He looked perturbed. This did not bode well for the next few days. </p> <p>The Nepalese rise early. A mouthful of breakfast at six; a large lunch around 10; an evening meal around six. In the capital Kathmandu, the handful of bars shut at 10pm. This took some getting used to. But the food on the trail did not. It is indicative of how the trekking experience has been overly sensitive towards Western tastes. Even the humblest backpacker hotel boasts a selection of Chinese, American, Indian, Mexican and Italian dishes.The local lentil and rice staple, dal bhat tarakari, is notoriously hard to find. Apple pie, however, is in abundance. </p> <p>Today we headed back towards Jomson on the way to Kagbani (2,810m). The monsoon rains had swollen the river Kagbani to cover the valley floor, so we had to wade across in bare feet. The highlight at the sturdy village of Kagbani was the monastery. It is more than 500 years old and boasts the customary cylindrical prayer bell which looked like a giant boiler. A guided tour costs 100 rupees, which includes a rooftop visit and a magnificent 360-degree view of the surrounding valley. </p> <p>Although Nepal is an overwhelmingly Hindu country, the mountain people are mostly Buddhist. Every village contains a temple, monastery or religious statue. It's tempting to find religious significance even in the mundane. The following day on the way to Muktinath (3,710m), the next, steep stage of the trail, I was taken by a curious circular arrangement of stones. The letter H appeared to have been spelt out in the middle. 'What's that?' I asked. 'It's for the helicopter landing,' Roshan said drily. </p> <p>At the end of my trekking stint, I was blister-free and only slightly stiff. Still, it was a relief to return to the comforts of my hotel room at Kathmandu's Royal Singi Hotel. Kathmandu is a bustling city whose 500,000 residents make their presence felt. A drive around the city reveals unsettling levels of poverty and sanitation. Most travellers end up sooner or later in Thamel, a sprawling bazaar of narrow streets crammed with shops. While shopping, bargaining is obligatory. Head to the Durbar Square for a look at the temples and palaces. </p> <p>Despite the undoubted allure of Kathmandu, the charm of Nepal lies in the hills. The scenery in the Himalayas, which include eight of the world's 10 highest mountains, is probably unrivalled anywhere. But perhaps the real selling point is the chance to embark on a spiritual break. This must be what they call the high life. </p> <p><strong> Fact file</strong> </p> <p>Akin Ojumu's itinerary was specially created by Exodus (020 8772 3821) but much of the route is covered in a 24-day 'Annapurna Circuit' tour that costs from \u00a31,298.

Many still stand and provide a fascinating link to our pre-Christian heritage. </p> <p>Pagan religion was at the heart of Stone Age society and the source of its most dramatic monuments. Stone circles were open-air temples and the locations for frequent ceremonies. One of the best remaining circles is <strong> Avebury</strong>, Wiltshire (on the A4361, tel: 01672 539 250). The circular ditch, a quarter of a mile in diameter, was dug with deer-antler pickaxes. It was 27ft deep in places and the earth was scooped up with ox shoulderblades. </p> <p><strong>Silbury Hill</strong> nearby, beside the A4 between Marlborough and Beckhampton, was the largest and most important altar in the country, standing 130ft tall. Pilgrims would have approached along the Ridgeway, so that the top of Silbury would appear to float along the horizon beside them. Its construction was a feat of engineering - a pyramid was formed by colossal blocks of chalk then filled with chalk rubble to make the white hill. </p> <p><strong>The Druids' Circle</strong>, above Penmaenmawr (you'll need OS map 115.723746) is a complex of about 30 granite stones overlooking Tal y Fan and Colwyn Bay. It is a steep climb, but worth the effort. The Stone of Sacrifice has a cavity large enough for a young child: legend has it that any child placed in the hollow in the first month of its life would be lucky in adulthood. </p> <p>However, the circle was excavated in 1958 and two child burial sites were discovered (one with a bronze knife and three sandstone sharpeners). Obviously some children were not as fortunate as others. </p> <p>Possibly the most important circle, the <strong>Rollright Stones</strong>, stands alone on an ancient Cotswold ridgeway (take the A3400 out of Long Compton, the second right takes you past the stones). They are known locally as the Kings' Men, who were turned to stone by a witch (the King himself is the large stone outside the circle). Their original intention is not clear and subsequent generations have created their own myths - but ask children to try counting them and they will always end up with different totals. </p> <p>The 35 stones of <strong>Castlerigg</strong>, which are about 4,500 years old, are ringed by breathtaking Cumbrian mountains: Skiddaw, Lonscale Fell, Blencathra and Clough Head and it was here that a large stone axe was found. They are signposted out of Keswick town centre to the west, between the A66 and the A591. </p> <p><strong>Tal y Fan</strong> mountainside, between Dolgarrog and Conway in North Wales, is scattered with monuments, including the poet stone and Maen-y-Bardd. Whoever spends the night beneath it will either go mad or become a poet. </p> <p>Many sacred circles were approached along lines of stones. The long rows at Merrivale, Devon, have been known as the <strong>Plague Market</strong> since the seventeenth century, when the healthy would bring food to plague victims out on the moor: from Tavistock take the B3357 to Merrivale, pass through the village and you'll find the stones on a plateau on the other side. </p> <p>Many burial mounds are similarly preserved. <strong>Belas Knap</strong>, in the Cotswolds between Winchcombe and Cheltenham, is a 200ft longbarrow. Inside there are four polygonal burial chambers accessed through a secret entrance and passageways inside the mound. Excavations in 1863 and 1928 unearthed the remains of almost 40 people, as well as a boar tusk pendant and stone implements which are now in Cheltenham Art Gallery &amp; Museum (01242 237 431). </p> <p><strong>King Arthur's Hall</strong>, an open rectangular earthwork on the western edge of Bodmin Moor in Devon, and only one of many monuments tenuously linked to Arthur, is within walking distance of four stone circles. Also on Bodmin is a network of three stone circles, <strong>The Hurlers</strong>. The most famous of the Arthur series, <strong>Arthur's Stone</strong>, has a huge 25-ton capstone which suggests it was an important tomb, although it is possibly the world's heaviest picnic table these days. It can be found near Hay-on-Wye on the road from Bredwardine to Dorstone. </p> <p>The Stone Age, so-called because of the flints that were essential for agriculture, witnessed the first settlements of Britons. As hunters began using the stars to navigate by, societies became less nomadic. This allowed people the freedom to farm and the Stone Age slowly became the Bronze Age.

The last time I did, to contest some long-forgotten point, I was confronted by a group of self-styled 'black youths'. Their response to all the arguments I made was simple: 'You don't know nuffink - you don't come from the street, Trev.'</p> <p>The phrase is guaranteed to make everyone in my family fall about laughing, and is usually employed by my daughters when an appeal to parental logic fails. Similarly, whilst out campaigning in recent London elections, I was asked several times by reporters how I could hope to identify with the 'youths on the street' given that I was educated and 'middle-class'. The only people who never seem to worry about this are the several thousand black teenagers I meet in schools and churches every year. But in my weaker moments, like every black person who was born poor and did better, I have my doubts.</p> <p>I am in my forties, yet I have a job, a family, and I have never been imprisoned. In today's world that means that I probably can't be black; so who is that person looking back at me from the mirror? Have I abandoned my 'roots'? The doubts last all of a dozen nanoseconds. After all, the roots of this country's black community lie in a group of ambitious immigrants who washed their hands of the colonial Caribbean backwaters so that their children could be middle-class lawyers, doctors, teachers and accountants. The sickening truth is that having fought for four centuries to throw off the shackles of slavery, we are entering the twenty-first century, being tempted to volunteer for a new kind of bondage - a subtle psychological entrapment that the late Bob Marley called 'mental slavery'. The horror is that this time we are willingly turning the key on ourselves and our own children.</p> <p>Coming from 'the street' is the latest test of authenticity for us. We are only genuinely black if we speak Jamaican, wear expensive designer clothes and reject anything that resembles formal education or scholarship. I don't blame young black men for the invention of this new mental ghetto; but every time I hear people who should know better encouraging them to believe that this kind of 'authenticity' is anything other than a pernicious, racist trap I want to tear them limb from limb. Some belong to our own community.</p> <p>In this American linguistics expert Professor John McWhorter is right. For many young black men it is easier to take the route of 'gold chains, no brains' than to battle the bias of school, street and workplace. For a very few, it pays off; 'gangsta' chic is worth millions to those who persuade middle-class white kids that listening to rap albums and wearing Tommy Hilfiger can bring the thrill of ghetto life to the suburbs, minus the risk of having your head blown off in a back-street deal that goes sour.</p> <p>For many of our radical supporters life would not be the same if a black person ever managed to become independently successful at anything that mattered - business, academia, government. Only if it comes as a result of their patronage will our success be acceptable; and for us to be patronised we have to be downtrodden and depressed. Hence, the new legend - that in a racist society, the only true representation of 'black' culture is to be found on the streets of the ghetto. Anything else is infected by the racism of white society, and any black person who refuses to conform is obviously an Uncle Tom.</p> <p>These stereotypes have an inglorious history. There has never been a time when there wasn't a myth about what defined a 'real' black man: our instinctive rhythm, our unbridled sexual potency, our uncontrollable rage, stupendous athleticism - oh and yes, our unrivalled propensity to fail.</p> <p>Much of the nonsense is amplified by Hollywood, which likes its black men in two varieties. One is the early Sidney Poitier model (now epitomised by Samuel Jackson and Wesley Snipes) - the mean, dangerous, ghetto rebel. The other is the later Sidney of To Sir With Love fame - noble, earnest, morally untouchable, but conformist; Denzel Washington has made this his own in recent years.</p> <p>The problem is that even this limited degree of complexity is too confusing for the entertainment and media industries. In most of Europe and North America, few white people outside of big cities ever meet a black person socially. Their idea of what a black person is like comes from TV or the movies. And it's too complicated to suggest that there might be several different kinds of black people - in fact as many different kinds of blacks as there are whites. So we make it simple. Older black people are like Trevor MacDonald - respectable, intelligent, but safe. Younger black people are chic, glamorous and dangerous. What a marvellous role they play for the radical - a ready-made group of nonconformists who can take the risks of challenging authority and tradition for the rest of us. So what if they pay the price of disadvantage and underachievement?

      "bodyText": "If you are a broadcaster, you should never go on any television programmes that offer the viewer the right to reply. The last time I did, to contest some long-forgotten point, I was confronted by a group of self-styled 'black youths'. Their response to all the arguments I made was simple: 'You don't know nuffink - you don't come from the street, Trev.' The phrase is guaranteed to make everyone in my family fall about laughing, and is usually employed by my daughters when an appeal to parental logic fails. Similarly, whilst out campaigning in recent London elections, I was asked several times by reporters how I could hope to identify with the 'youths on the street' given that I was educated and 'middle-class'. The only people who never seem to worry about this are the several thousand black teenagers I meet in schools and churches every year. But in my weaker moments, like every black person who was born poor and did better, I have my doubts. I am in my forties, yet I have a job, a family, and I have never been imprisoned. In today's world that means that I probably can't be black; so who is that person looking back at me from the mirror? Have I abandoned my 'roots'? The doubts last all of a dozen nanoseconds. After all, the roots of this country's black community lie in a group of ambitious immigrants who washed their hands of the colonial Caribbean backwaters so that their children could be middle-class lawyers, doctors, teachers and accountants. The sickening truth is that having fought for four centuries to throw off the shackles of slavery, we are entering the twenty-first century, being tempted to volunteer for a new kind of bondage - a subtle psychological entrapment that the late Bob Marley called 'mental slavery'. The horror is that this time we are willingly turning the key on ourselves and our own children. Coming from 'the street' is the latest test of authenticity for us. We are only genuinely black if we speak Jamaican, wear expensive designer clothes and reject anything that resembles formal education or scholarship. I don't blame young black men for the invention of this new mental ghetto; but every time I hear people who should know better encouraging them to believe that this kind of 'authenticity' is anything other than a pernicious, racist trap I want to tear them limb from limb. Some belong to our own community. In this American linguistics expert Professor John McWhorter is right. For many young black men it is easier to take the route of 'gold chains, no brains' than to battle the bias of school, street and workplace. For a very few, it pays off; 'gangsta' chic is worth millions to those who persuade middle-class white kids that listening to rap albums and wearing Tommy Hilfiger can bring the thrill of ghetto life to the suburbs, minus the risk of having your head blown off in a back-street deal that goes sour. For many of our radical supporters life would not be the same if a black person ever managed to become independently successful at anything that mattered - business, academia, government. Only if it comes as a result of their patronage will our success be acceptable; and for us to be patronised we have to be downtrodden and depressed. Hence, the new legend - that in a racist society, the only true representation of 'black' culture is to be found on the streets of the ghetto. Anything else is infected by the racism of white society, and any black person who refuses to conform is obviously an Uncle Tom. These stereotypes have an inglorious history. There has never been a time when there wasn't a myth about what defined a 'real' black man: our instinctive rhythm, our unbridled sexual potency, our uncontrollable rage, stupendous athleticism - oh and yes, our unrivalled propensity to fail. Much of the nonsense is amplified by Hollywood, which likes its black men in two varieties. One is the early Sidney Poitier model (now epitomised by Samuel Jackson and Wesley Snipes) - the mean, dangerous, ghetto rebel. The other is the later Sidney of To Sir With Love fame - noble, earnest, morally untouchable, but conformist; Denzel Washington has made this his own in recent years. The problem is that even this limited degree of complexity is too confusing for the entertainment and media industries. In most of Europe and North America, few white people outside of big cities ever meet a black person socially. Their idea of what a black person is like comes from TV or the movies. And it's too complicated to suggest that there might be several different kinds of black people - in fact as many different kinds of blacks as there are whites. So we make it simple. Older black people are like Trevor MacDonald - respectable, intelligent, but safe. Younger black people are chic, glamorous and dangerous. What a marvellous role they play for the radical - a ready-made group of nonconformists who can take the risks of challenging authority and tradition for the rest of us. So what if they pay the price of disadvantage and underachievement? They can't possibly be worse off than they are now, and who knows, their conflicts may be the catalyst that triggers reform. It's time for everyone to wake up to the fact that the major thing that black people share, whatever their age, beliefs and station in life, is the way that they are treated by white people. Wherever we are, we are still likely to meet prejudice and discrimination. But that isn't the only thing that defines us, because aside from it we are as varied as any group of people. There is no one way of being black, and there is no single 'authentic' black experience. One of the best make-up artists in British TV once told me many years ago that African skins have over 60 colour tones as opposed to the 17 characteristic of Northern Europeans. 'Never let anyone just paint you matt black,' she said. The lesson still needs to be learnt.",

'I have no friends, no boyfriends and no life,' a 'heartbroken Chelsea complained to a pal'. She 'just wants to have someone her own age to love'. Here's the typical stew of 'pals' and anonymous 'insiders'. Do they exist? Probably. Have they any special insights? No. We're riding through Rentaquote County. Page after page on the pharmacy stand wouldn't see the light of day in Britain. Page after page runs straightforwardly foul of Press Complaints Commission edict. But America has no PCC, and barely a press council. The posher papers resist any attempt to agree a code of practice because they think it will curb their First Amendment rights. There is, thus, not a chance that the Enquirers and Examiners will be brought under any sort of control. They can go on their own way. And the newspaper industry's men in respectable suits turn their backs. Wonderful freedom? Organised hypocrisy? Take your pick. But don't endure too many high-minded lectures without tossing a point or two in the other direction.",

      "body": "<p>I am not sure any of us need to be cooking at this point in the year. Time to switch off and chill. If I am to be caught within six feet of a cooker, it will be in the cool of the early morning, boiling dried beans or potatoes for a salad for lunch, long before the sun comes overhead and turns my kitchen skylights into magnifying glasses. (Leave the Sunday papers on the table and you could start a small fire.) By nine o'clock, the hob is off and the bones of lunch are cooling. </p> <p>Once you have spooned up pale-green flageolet beans tossed with verdant olive oil and a bunch of parsley while they were still warm, you may wonder how our national bean salad - kidney beans, sweetcorn and raw green pepper - ever came to be. It shouldn't have. That salad is a recipe filled with hate if ever there was one. </p> <p>Get a bean salad right - warm, tiny beans, peppery oil, a barrowload of herbs - and you could, if you close your eyes tightly, be on a sun-dappled terraced in Tuscany. Get it wrong - tinned maroon beans, chilli powder, that wretched tinned sweetcorn, and still cold from the fridge - and you could be in a motorway service station salad bar on the M25. </p> <p>The long, oval beans such as cannellini and flageolet that resemble those liqourice torpedos you used to get from the sweet shop (remember sweet shops?) are an elegant start. Like potatoes, they need dressing while they're hot. The wise will take advantage of the fact that warm starch sponges up oil or mayonnaise and becomes silky and pleasing in the mouth. Season your beans at this point, and no earlier - adding salt to the cooking water will only turn them to pebbles. If I haven't made my dressing by the time the beans are cooked, I usually drain them and shake a glug or two of oil and a twist of salt and pepper over them. They will then wait contendedly, without drying up, till I get my act together. </p> <p>If it is to be a dish of beans for lunch, then we had better go to town with the rest. The most gorgeous, glistening, slow-glugging oil from a single estate will, for once, show its true colours. Too often, expensive oils are used to little effect. This, on bruschetta and warm green vegetables, is the place to show them off. Some fine vinegar - the Spanish Forum brand is nicely rounded - and handfuls, armfuls, bucketfuls of fresh herbs are a good start. </p> <p>Parsley, so misunderstood, has an affinity with beans, much as it does with potatoes. Basil too. It makes them look interesting and adds a bolt of freshness to their mealy depths. You could stop here and you would still have had a good time, but if a bowl of beans, oil, vinegar and parsley sounds more penance than pleasure, you will need to go shopping. Tuna, tinned - look out for the pale and interesting Ortiz brand white variety - or a thick slice of the fresh fish lightly grilled is a choice steeped in tradition. Grilled salmon, which is not, is surprisingly good here, and looks cool and summery too. Actually, most fish are happy in a bean dish. </p> <p>You cannot go wrong with fish and beans - just think of the robust delights of cod and lentils. Some squid grilled till it blackens here and there will add a change of texture and welcome smokiness. I would add lemon rather than vinegar and perhaps ditch half the parsley in favour of coriander. Suddenly things start to taste as if we are on holiday. </p> <p>Meat and beans are all right if we stick to bacon and ham (or duck), though we are in danger of spending too much time at the stove. Some chopped pancetta, fried slowly so that it uses its own fat, is probably the carnivore's best bet. I wouldn't do it too early, however, despite what I said before, in case it gets a bit tough. I will do a modicum of cooking in this weather, but don't ask me to chew as well. </p> <p>I think we need some bitterness here, either in the form of a leaf - rocket and watercress will both work, but the former adds a tantalising spikiness - or a chopped preserved lemon. Once hard to find, they now pop all over the place. Middle Eastern grocers often have ones the size of apricots, preserved in salt and sometimes a little oil. The point is they are bitter and salty and so add a double-edged interest. </p> <p>Such salads could, if they must, be used as a side dish. It seems a waste, though - surely they have enough going for them, particularly if you add fish or pancetta. They would be fine alongside grilled aubergines (slice and salt them, then rinse, pat dry and grill before dressing immediately with olive oil and lemon or some lemon-infused oil). Why not chuck in some smoked chicken if you like it, torn from its bones and cut into thick shards, or chunks of tart goat's cheese? </p> <p>To get a bit practical, these are variations on one of the few salads that benefit from being made earlier in the day - their flavour will improve and the beans become more velvety. You could make up the heart and soul of the recipes earlier, so that starch and their dressings have time to 'marry', then add the fresh leaves and quickly cooked fish or grilled meat just before you eat. That way you will be able to get the cooking out of the way before the sun is high and have a lunch that will be better, rather than worse, for being 'one I made earlier'. </p> <p> <strong> Flageolet with salmon, preserved lemons and rocket</strong> </p> <p> Enough for 2 as a main dish </p> <p>150g dried flageolet beans </p> <p>300g salmon fillet (the tail is good here) </p> <p>1 tbsp white-wine vinegar </p> <p>6 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil </p> <p>a preserved (pickled) lemon </p> <p>a loosely cupped handful of coriander leaves </p> <p>2 small bunches (about 100g) rocket leaves </p> <p>Rinse the beans - they can be dusty - and check them over for any small stones, then soak them overnight in cold water. They will need a good five or six hours. Drain them, then tip into a deep pan of furiously boiling water, but adding no salt (it would make them tough). Let them cook for 10 minutes or so at a fierce boil - this is supposed to stop them from giving you wind later on - then turn them down to a rolling boil. I put a little olive oil and a few bay leaves in at this point but for no other real reason than it makes the kitchen smell good as they cook. </p> <p>If the water gets low, add some from the kettle. The time they take is anyone's guess - much depends on the age of your beans. At this time, they are certain to be last year's harvest, so they need at least 40 minutes (mine took an hour.) New season's dried beans that appear in the autumn should be tender in 20 minutes. A tender bean squashes easily between your fingers. The best way is to taste them. </p> <p>Put the salmon on a dish or grill pan and rub it lightly with oil, then cook it under an overhead grill for 10 minutes or so till the flesh is just opaque. </p> <p>To make the dressing, add the vinegar to the oil in a large mixing bowl, a grind of salt and pepper (remember that the lemon will be salty), then finely chop the lemon and roughly chop the coriander leaves, and add them both to the oil and vinegar. Pull the fish from its skin in fat chunks (I think bigger pieces are more attractive in a salad), and add them to the dressing. No need to toss yet. </p> <p>Drain the beans (you can get them ready early in the day and shake them in a little seasoned olive oil while they are warm), then toss them gently with the salmon and dressing. Try not to break up the fish. </p> <p>Pick the rocket over, discarding anything that is not in good nick, then fold the leaves tenderly into the salad and serve in the next half hour or so, before the leaves wilt in the dressing. </p> <p> <strong> Cannellini with coppa, spinach and mustard olives</strong> </p> <p> Enough for 2 as a light lunch with bread </p> <p>150g dried cannellini beans </p> <p><strong> for the olives</strong> </p> <p>100g black olives </p> <p>5 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil </p> <p>1 tbsp of red-wine vinegar </p> <p>1 tbsp smooth Dijon mustard </p> <p>1 tsp thyme leaves, chopped </p> <p>4 handfuls of small spinach or watercress leaves </p> <p>75g thinly sliced coppa or other cured meat </p> <p>a loose handful of basil leaves (thick and pungent) </p> <p>Cook the beans to tenderness in a large, deep pan of boiling, unsalted water. They will take from 25 minutes to one hour, and are ready when you can easily crush them between finger and thumb, but they should retain a bit of 'bite'. Drain them and toss them with the olives and their dressing, below. </p> <p>While the beans are cooking, mix the olive oil, vinegar and mustard with a fork in a small bowl, then whisk in the chopped thyme and some salt and pepper. The dressing will be thick and creamy. Stone the olives, dropping each into the mustard dressing as you go. Set aside for an hour or so. </p> <p>When you are ready to eat, rinse the spinach in cold water and shake it dry, removing all but the very finest stems, then put it into a large serving dish. Peel any shreds of skin from the outside of the coppa, then shred the meat into thick matchstick-width ribbons. Put them in with the spinach, separating the strips as you go. Tear the basil into small pieces, scattering them into the dish. Tip the beans, olives and dressing over, fold the ingredients gently together, then serve.</p>",

Grilled salmon, which is not, is surprisingly good here, and looks cool and summery too. Actually, most fish are happy in a bean dish. You cannot go wrong with fish and beans - just think of the robust delights of cod and lentils. Some squid grilled till it blackens here and there will add a change of texture and welcome smokiness. I would add lemon rather than vinegar and perhaps ditch half the parsley in favour of coriander. Suddenly things start to taste as if we are on holiday. Meat and beans are all right if we stick to bacon and ham (or duck), though we are in danger of spending too much time at the stove. Some chopped pancetta, fried slowly so that it uses its own fat, is probably the carnivore's best bet. I wouldn't do it too early, however, despite what I said before, in case it gets a bit tough. I will do a modicum of cooking in this weather, but don't ask me to chew as well. I think we need some bitterness here, either in the form of a leaf - rocket and watercress will both work, but the former adds a tantalising spikiness - or a chopped preserved lemon. Once hard to find, they now pop all over the place. Middle Eastern grocers often have ones the size of apricots, preserved in salt and sometimes a little oil. The point is they are bitter and salty and so add a double-edged interest. Such salads could, if they must, be used as a side dish. It seems a waste, though - surely they have enough going for them, particularly if you add fish or pancetta. They would be fine alongside grilled aubergines (slice and salt them, then rinse, pat dry and grill before dressing immediately with olive oil and lemon or some lemon-infused oil). Why not chuck in some smoked chicken if you like it, torn from its bones and cut into thick shards, or chunks of tart goat's cheese? To get a bit practical, these are variations on one of the few salads that benefit from being made earlier in the day - their flavour will improve and the beans become more velvety. You could make up the heart and soul of the recipes earlier, so that starch and their dressings have time to 'marry', then add the fresh leaves and quickly cooked fish or grilled meat just before you eat. That way you will be able to get the cooking out of the way before the sun is high and have a lunch that will be better, rather than worse, for being 'one I made earlier'. Flageolet with salmon, preserved lemons and rocket Enough for 2 as a main dish 150g dried flageolet beans 300g salmon fillet (the tail is good here) 1 tbsp white-wine vinegar 6 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil a preserved (pickled) lemon a loosely cupped handful of coriander leaves 2 small bunches (about 100g) rocket leaves Rinse the beans - they can be dusty - and check them over for any small stones, then soak them overnight in cold water. They will need a good five or six hours. Drain them, then tip into a deep pan of furiously boiling water, but adding no salt (it would make them tough). Let them cook for 10 minutes or so at a fierce boil - this is supposed to stop them from giving you wind later on - then turn them down to a rolling boil. I put a little olive oil and a few bay leaves in at this point but for no other real reason than it makes the kitchen smell good as they cook. If the water gets low, add some from the kettle. The time they take is anyone's guess - much depends on the age of your beans. At this time, they are certain to be last year's harvest, so they need at least 40 minutes (mine took an hour.) New season's dried beans that appear in the autumn should be tender in 20 minutes. A tender bean squashes easily between your fingers. The best way is to taste them. Put the salmon on a dish or grill pan and rub it lightly with oil, then cook it under an overhead grill for 10 minutes or so till the flesh is just opaque. To make the dressing, add the vinegar to the oil in a large mixing bowl, a grind of salt and pepper (remember that the lemon will be salty), then finely chop the lemon and roughly chop the coriander leaves, and add them both to the oil and vinegar. Pull the fish from its skin in fat chunks (I think bigger pieces are more attractive in a salad), and add them to the dressing. No need to toss yet. Drain the beans (you can get them ready early in the day and shake them in a little seasoned olive oil while they are warm), then toss them gently with the salmon and dressing. Try not to break up the fish. Pick the rocket over, discarding anything that is not in good nick, then fold the leaves tenderly into the salad and serve in the next half hour or so, before the leaves wilt in the dressing. Cannellini with coppa, spinach and mustard olives Enough for 2 as a light lunch with bread 150g dried cannellini beans for the olives 100g black olives 5 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil 1 tbsp of red-wine vinegar 1 tbsp smooth Dijon mustard 1 tsp thyme leaves, chopped 4 handfuls of small spinach or watercress leaves 75g thinly sliced coppa or other cured meat a loose handful of basil leaves (thick and pungent) Cook the beans to tenderness in a large, deep pan of boiling, unsalted water. They will take from 25 minutes to one hour, and are ready when you can easily crush them between finger and thumb, but they should retain a bit of 'bite'. Drain them and toss them with the olives and their dressing, below. While the beans are cooking, mix the olive oil, vinegar and mustard with a fork in a small bowl, then whisk in the chopped thyme and some salt and pepper. The dressing will be thick and creamy. Stone the olives, dropping each into the mustard dressing as you go. Set aside for an hour or so. When you are ready to eat, rinse the spinach in cold water and shake it dry, removing all but the very finest stems, then put it into a large serving dish. Peel any shreds of skin from the outside of the coppa, then shred the meat into thick matchstick-width ribbons. Put them in with the spinach, separating the strips as you go. Tear the basil into small pieces, scattering them into the dish. Tip the beans, olives and dressing over, fold the ingredients gently together, then serve.",

      "body": "<p>Here is an amazing thing - a gladiolus in the garden after all these years. Not amazing just because of its intensity of colour - although that is astonishing enough, mauve with a haze of magenta fighting through, giving it a satiny iridescence - but that it should be there at all. Sarah apparently got a dozen among a mixed lot of bulbs for her birthday last February and popped them into the ground in the general rush to get bulbs in this spring (incidentally, we planted all our alliums as late as March and even some tulips, too, and all did well. I suspect that on heavy, wet soil there is something to be said for very late bulb planting). </p> <p>There have not been gladioli in any garden of mine for 25 years because I strongly associate them with my childhood. If I try to remember (and I have not done this for a long while), I walk down to the chickens, turn left at the walnut tree and on the right of the grass path leading to the chickens is a bed that always housed dahlias and gladioli. The grass edge is raised up like a causeway, wisps of cut grass in the dry earth gutter. This is my mother's area of concern, all grown in rows and the dahlias staked with square posts, the gladioli with bamboos, both overwintering in tied bundles in the potting shed. The hens fidget at the gate. </p> <p>If I turn and look now, dahlias nearest the chickens, gladioli in the first half, I see like a cine film that the colours are demented, washed out pigments that don't add up to anything you can piece together into any coherent whole. Pale yellows, lipstick pinks (heavy 1950s lipstick, crescent stains on the porcelain), oranges like ice lollies and the palest of blues. But no one thought to judge them as part of the garden. They were grown as a crop, only coming into aesthetic consideration once picked and put into a vase. Hence their position tucked away down by the chickens, on the edge of the kitchen garden. They were produce, not art. </p> <p>Then Dame Edna Everage started to include gladioli in her act. I remember sitting in the gods more than 20 years ago, watching her humiliate those in the stalls, showering the front rows with dozens of gladioli at the finale. I don't know why gladioli were chosen to be such an integral part of the image, but at the time I assumed it was because everyone would instantly recognise their inherently kitsch ugliness. </p> <p>I don't want to sound snotty about them, because my plan is to go through the catalogues and, if I have time, visit a show where there is a wide variety and choose the really good colours, such as 'Oscar' in the giant-flowered group, 'Black Lash', 'Arabian Night' and 'Black Beauty' or the lime-green 'Spring Green' (these have all been taken from Sarah Raven's The Bold &amp; Brilliant Garden , \u00a325, Francis Lincoln). I want colours that burn, albeit with a sullen glow. Nothing remotely pale or washed out. And here, I think, is where the Dame Edna connection makes sense, because a large, modern florist's pastel gladiolus look like nothing so much as an elderly man in drag, trapped in his mother's clothes. </p> <p>So, now I have these glads in the garden, I am about to chuck away a quarter of a century's prejudice and order more for next year. Apart from anything else, gladioli are so much part of this late-summer season - fresh faces in what can become a slightly jaded crowd. </p> <p>Actually not all gladioli belong to late summer. Earlier this summer, on my visits to Guernsey, I enjoyed Gladiolus byzantinus, with its slender form, magenta flowers and architectural, sword-shaped leaves. I'd never seen it before and found myself liking it before the anti-gladiolus knee could jerk. It prefers dry, rather poor soil, and I don't know if it would grow on our wet clay, although it thrives in the Channel Islands and I am sure would do well on southern chalk. I shall try it anyway. It is a hardy perennial that comes from the Mediterranean - unlike most gladioli which come from South Africa - so does not need lifting after flowering, which all the late-flowering ones do unless you are in an exceptionally mild area. </p> <p>John Tradescant recorded it during his forays on to the Algerian coast in 1620, reporting that 'the corn flag of Constantinople grew by the acre in Barbary'. Gladiolus byzantinus is planted in autumn along with the spring bulbs and flowers (in Guernsey at any rate) from May through to July. I like the sound of the creamy, green-tinged Gladiolus tristis, which will start flowering even earlier, in April, and is powerfully night-scented, although apparently the scent soon fades when the flowers are cut. The solution seems to be to grow it in a container which can be brought indoors while it is in flower. </p> <p> Gladiolus papilio (sometimes sold as Gladiolus purpureoauratus - just more tedious dazed-and-confused botanical nomenclature) is another hardy variety, although it does not fit the usual range of garish gladioli colours. Brian Mathew, in his authoritative book Bulbs - The Four Seasons (\u00a319.99, Pavilion) says that it is 'cultivated more as a curiosity than for show, although some like its muted colours'. </p> <p>This immediately set me looking for a picture, and the RHS encyclopedia has a shot of it looking distinguished and subtle, so of course I was converted. That is definitely on the list, too. It does come with a warning that it can be invasive, spreading by stolons, but perhaps it is best to think of it as a bulb that can be naturalised - as one might treat bluebells, snowdrops or narcissi. It apparently has glaucous leaves, and a comparatively short stem (24in) and, unlike byzantinus, flowers best in a rather damp, rich soil. That's us sorted and one in the eye for the hysterical gladioli school. </p> <p>Typically, the obsession with creating new and ever more garish forms of gladioli come from men. Gladioli became caught up in the hybridisation obsession that swept through the Victorian era and still inexplicably dominates much of the activity from nurseries and flower shows. Apparently, in the middle of the 19th century, James Kelway discovered Gladiolus psittacinus (now more likely to be sold under the name of Gladiolus dalenii ) and, to quote Miles Hadfield in his peerless History of British Gardening , (Penguin, out of print) 'saw within it possibilities of improvement'. By 1861 he was distributing the first of florists' gladioli. </p> <p>Unlike the species, Florists' gladioli need quite a lot of tending to get the best out of them. They have to be staked individually, dead-headed, weeded, watered and fed if the tower of flower is to be at its best. They are also prone to the gladiolus thrip - a tiny black insect that feeds off both foliage and flowers, rasping the leaves and leaving the surfaces a glistening pale grey. The leaves then turn brown and dry out. They also attack the developing flowers, so that the buds wither before they open. I have to admit that I have never noticed this, but then I wouldn't, having not observed a gladiolus without a dismissive sneer for quarter of a century. </p> <p><strong>Your roots</strong> Growing gladioli from corms and cormels</p> <p>Gladioli need a friable, well-dug site, with plenty of compost or manure. They grow from corms planted in May. Corms should be dug up after flowering, dried and stored in a cool, dark dry place. Gladioli grown on wet soil are prone to bacterial blight.

Let the corm and cormels dry out and, the following February, they can be teased off the corm. Plant cormels an inch deep and an inch apart in a seed tray. When shoots develop, pot up or plant in a cold frame. Give them a couple of years to flower, then treat them as other corms.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Each season, each week almost, the evidence grows - football has an addiction problem. More than ever, the all-seeing media highlights the drinking, drugging and gambling. And more than ever, players with more money have the wherewithal to indulge it. Tony Adams has watched it all with a mixture of personal relief, gratitude and sadness for others. It is why, as reported elsewhere in The Observer, he wants to establish his own treatment centre to help his fellow professionals. </p> <p>Adams, the Arsenal captain and likely to be named the leader of England again when Kevin Keegan announces his squad next Thursday, is four years into his recovery from alcoholism; that is, four years without a drink. Both drunk and sober he has seen, he says, too many players not receiving the support they need, scared to admit they might have an illness. </p> <p>As a result, their careers are damaged or curtailed due to fear and ignorance on the part of clubs, the game's authorities and some sections of the public, Adams believes. He wonders how much more Paul Gascoigne might have achieved and, more important, how much more fulfilled his life over the last 10 years might have been. He hopes that a specialist centre might yet help George Best and Diego Maradona. </p> <p>'One player phoned me recently to say he thought he had a problem,' says Adams. 'But he was worried that people wouldn't understand and I've not heard since. Maybe he hasn't had enough of drinking yet but if a treatment centre for footballers did exist, someone like him might get recovery sooner and not waste years.' </p> <p>Adams is currently looking for an appropriate facility to house a 12-bed centre. It would employ all the best elements of a traditional treatment centre - supervised detoxification, qualified counsellors, a programme based on the Twelve Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous - but with an additional element that might encourage players and football clubs to accept help more readily. 'I think a lot of managers are worried about losing a player for four to six weeks and wondering what they will get back,' says Adams. 'If they know he will be fit and ready to play, and probably be a better player for recovery, they might be more keen on the idea.' </p> <p>His plan is to have a football pitch in the grounds, a weights room and indoor swimming pool, and fitness programmes tailored to the individual in conjunction with their club, overseen by a physiologist, so that physical conditioning runs alongside the mutual-help group therapy. 'A place for mind, body and soul,' says Adams. </p> <p>There are many good private treatment centres in this country, Adams agrees, but he believes they cannot adequately cater for the fitness requirements of a professional footballer. There is also another reason why players might be more open to such a venue. </p> <p>'I don't think in my last four years I've really been able to talk openly about how it feels to have money and celebrity, and the issues that raises, other than on a one-to-one basis. It is hard for people to understand. Here, players might be able to deal with it. I mean, what guarantee against illness is money and celebrity?' </p> <p>One has only to gauge the reaction to recent stories that Roy Keane was suffering from 'stress', or last season when Stan Collymore was diagnosed with depression, to see what Adams means. Whatever Keane's reasons for recently attending an AA meeting - to help a friend, he insisted - it still illustrates the social stigma attached to addictive illness. </p> <p>Adams insists that the centre will not be elitist, however, acknowledging that the reason why AA, Al-Anon (for partners of addicts), Narcotics, Gamblers and Overeaters Anonymous work is because they teach humility and equality - the reason why first names only are used - and that people come from all walks of life. 'This centre will be the start of recovery, not the end. Players will have to continue to attend the fellowships,' says Adams. </p> <p>So far he has sounded out the FA and the PFA and found them supportive, he says, the FA even offering him the use of Lilleshall, but he believes players would be more receptive to an independent centre. It would, though, take the successful elements of the best centres, including four-bed dormitories rather than private rooms, which can encourage the isolation that the illness provokes. Mobile phones would be banned. </p> <p>The FA currently uses the Priory Group, who have successfully treated Paul Merson and Alex Rae, but Adams worries that increased publicity may be stopping some players from going, some managers from sending them. </p> <p>'I've seen players shifted on to other clubs to get rid of the problem,' says Adams. 'They won't get better, as people or players, that way. I hope this centre would be a safe, secure place away from prying eyes so that players can come to terms with their shame while they learn about their problem.' </p> <p>Adams also believes that his involvement might help. He is willing to invest his own money in the project, and also has backing from a wealthy sympathiser, and would be available to introduce players to the centre before passing them on to specialists. It is the way that Eric Clapton set up his Crossroads facility in Antigua. </p> <p>'You can't push people,' Adams agrees. 'But if people do want help, I would love to have a one-to-one conversation with them to see if they want to go in, and if I want them in there. One player has told me that he didn't want to talk to anyone else about this because not many people understand a footballer's problems.' </p> <p>Initially, he would just take footballers but would consider extending it to other sports people. 'I think I'm going to have enough footballers to keep me busy at first,' he says with a smile. </p> <p>As well as the burgeoning interest in football and its personalities' private lives, there is another reason for the growing exposure of addiction in the game. The arrival of overseas players and managers, with their enlightened methods in diet and training, have shown up the drinking and betting culture of the English game. Domestic players are having a mirror held up to themselves. </p> <p>In addition, the riches mean that players are able to indulge more and thus encounter problems sooner than previous generations.

      "bodyText": "Each season, each week almost, the evidence grows - football has an addiction problem. More than ever, the all-seeing media highlights the drinking, drugging and gambling. And more than ever, players with more money have the wherewithal to indulge it. Tony Adams has watched it all with a mixture of personal relief, gratitude and sadness for others. It is why, as reported elsewhere in The Observer, he wants to establish his own treatment centre to help his fellow professionals. Adams, the Arsenal captain and likely to be named the leader of England again when Kevin Keegan announces his squad next Thursday, is four years into his recovery from alcoholism; that is, four years without a drink. Both drunk and sober he has seen, he says, too many players not receiving the support they need, scared to admit they might have an illness. As a result, their careers are damaged or curtailed due to fear and ignorance on the part of clubs, the game's authorities and some sections of the public, Adams believes. He wonders how much more Paul Gascoigne might have achieved and, more important, how much more fulfilled his life over the last 10 years might have been. He hopes that a specialist centre might yet help George Best and Diego Maradona. 'One player phoned me recently to say he thought he had a problem,' says Adams. 'But he was worried that people wouldn't understand and I've not heard since. Maybe he hasn't had enough of drinking yet but if a treatment centre for footballers did exist, someone like him might get recovery sooner and not waste years.' Adams is currently looking for an appropriate facility to house a 12-bed centre. It would employ all the best elements of a traditional treatment centre - supervised detoxification, qualified counsellors, a programme based on the Twelve Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous - but with an additional element that might encourage players and football clubs to accept help more readily. 'I think a lot of managers are worried about losing a player for four to six weeks and wondering what they will get back,' says Adams. 'If they know he will be fit and ready to play, and probably be a better player for recovery, they might be more keen on the idea.' His plan is to have a football pitch in the grounds, a weights room and indoor swimming pool, and fitness programmes tailored to the individual in conjunction with their club, overseen by a physiologist, so that physical conditioning runs alongside the mutual-help group therapy. 'A place for mind, body and soul,' says Adams. There are many good private treatment centres in this country, Adams agrees, but he believes they cannot adequately cater for the fitness requirements of a professional footballer. There is also another reason why players might be more open to such a venue. 'I don't think in my last four years I've really been able to talk openly about how it feels to have money and celebrity, and the issues that raises, other than on a one-to-one basis. It is hard for people to understand. Here, players might be able to deal with it. I mean, what guarantee against illness is money and celebrity?' One has only to gauge the reaction to recent stories that Roy Keane was suffering from 'stress', or last season when Stan Collymore was diagnosed with depression, to see what Adams means. Whatever Keane's reasons for recently attending an AA meeting - to help a friend, he insisted - it still illustrates the social stigma attached to addictive illness. Adams insists that the centre will not be elitist, however, acknowledging that the reason why AA, Al-Anon (for partners of addicts), Narcotics, Gamblers and Overeaters Anonymous work is because they teach humility and equality - the reason why first names only are used - and that people come from all walks of life. 'This centre will be the start of recovery, not the end. Players will have to continue to attend the fellowships,' says Adams. So far he has sounded out the FA and the PFA and found them supportive, he says, the FA even offering him the use of Lilleshall, but he believes players would be more receptive to an independent centre. It would, though, take the successful elements of the best centres, including four-bed dormitories rather than private rooms, which can encourage the isolation that the illness provokes. Mobile phones would be banned. The FA currently uses the Priory Group, who have successfully treated Paul Merson and Alex Rae, but Adams worries that increased publicity may be stopping some players from going, some managers from sending them. 'I've seen players shifted on to other clubs to get rid of the problem,' says Adams. 'They won't get better, as people or players, that way. I hope this centre would be a safe, secure place away from prying eyes so that players can come to terms with their shame while they learn about their problem.' Adams also believes that his involvement might help. He is willing to invest his own money in the project, and also has backing from a wealthy sympathiser, and would be available to introduce players to the centre before passing them on to specialists. It is the way that Eric Clapton set up his Crossroads facility in Antigua. 'You can't push people,' Adams agrees. 'But if people do want help, I would love to have a one-to-one conversation with them to see if they want to go in, and if I want them in there. One player has told me that he didn't want to talk to anyone else about this because not many people understand a footballer's problems.' Initially, he would just take footballers but would consider extending it to other sports people. 'I think I'm going to have enough footballers to keep me busy at first,' he says with a smile. As well as the burgeoning interest in football and its personalities' private lives, there is another reason for the growing exposure of addiction in the game. The arrival of overseas players and managers, with their enlightened methods in diet and training, have shown up the drinking and betting culture of the English game. Domestic players are having a mirror held up to themselves. In addition, the riches mean that players are able to indulge more and thus encounter problems sooner than previous generations. 'The penny has dropped too late for some players' careers,' says Adams. 'I've seen too many players get it only when their career ends.' At least Jimmy Greaves got it. That recent repeat showing of Martin Bashir's interview with a George Best acknowledging his problem with alcohol but sadly clueless about how to recover from it - as shown by his relapse this summer - made painful, poignant viewing, however. So too the alarming Channel 4 documentary about Diego Maradona's supposed rehabilitation from drug addiction at a non-specialist facility in Cuba. They missed the real story. In fact, a source close to Maradona has told me, there are grave fears for the big-hearted, weak-hearted man. Latterly he has replaced drugs with drink, I understand. Adams's centre, which he hopes to have up and running in 18 months to two years, cannot come a moment too soon.",

As for the second question, sterling was stable against the dollar for many years at $1.60 and has moved in a single step to $1.50. Unlike the euro it has not wobbled back and forth on its downward march. </p> <p>The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee deserves a faint cheer for that. We have a competent central bank, unlike the eurozone. So the pound's alleged overvalua tion is more the euro's fault than ours. But our inferiority complex prevents us from laying the blame where it should be laid. </p> <p>There is much muddle in the debate. If tomorrow Blair were to follow Toyota's lead and say that all prices will be displayed in euros, it would not make the slightest difference. No doubt the Tories and the UK Independence Party would protest. The tabloids would rant. Then we can have prices displayed in both euros and sterling. So what? We could go on doing as before, and the whole exercise will be less painful than decimalisation. You can display prices in any currency you like. The issue is, are you linked to it in a fixed ratio? </p> <p>Here I believe that those who want to speed up Blair are deluding themselves that the mere announcement of a referendum will immediately bring the pound down to where they want. Even if there was to be a move down, it would be very small. The markets would not believe that the pound could enter the euro at anything less than 3 Deutschmarks in the old money. Dreams of DM2.50 or even DM2.80 are just that. Manufacturers will have to adjust to the high value. The new industries will do so; the metal bashers will die. </p> <p>The reason, of course, is the fundamental strength of the economy. Since he is abroad and unlikely to read this, I don't mind paying a tribute to Gordon Brown's management of the economy, although I would add Eddie George's name as well. </p> <p>We used to think that we had to join the ERM to gain stability and credibility. But we have achieved all that on our own - painfully but still on our own. </p> <p>So there is less urgency to the euro question than people think. The real need is to wait and see whether the euro will stabilise itself around any particular value for even as long as six months. If it settles at $1 and the pound stays at $1.50, that would be the time to join. </p> <p>Until then we can all enjoy our holidays abroad.</p>",

The pound also gets 'yes' for the first. As for the second question, sterling was stable against the dollar for many years at $1.60 and has moved in a single step to $1.50. Unlike the euro it has not wobbled back and forth on its downward march. The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee deserves a faint cheer for that. We have a competent central bank, unlike the eurozone. So the pound's alleged overvalua tion is more the euro's fault than ours. But our inferiority complex prevents us from laying the blame where it should be laid. There is much muddle in the debate. If tomorrow Blair were to follow Toyota's lead and say that all prices will be displayed in euros, it would not make the slightest difference. No doubt the Tories and the UK Independence Party would protest. The tabloids would rant. Then we can have prices displayed in both euros and sterling. So what? We could go on doing as before, and the whole exercise will be less painful than decimalisation. You can display prices in any currency you like. The issue is, are you linked to it in a fixed ratio? Here I believe that those who want to speed up Blair are deluding themselves that the mere announcement of a referendum will immediately bring the pound down to where they want. Even if there was to be a move down, it would be very small. The markets would not believe that the pound could enter the euro at anything less than 3 Deutschmarks in the old money. Dreams of DM2.50 or even DM2.80 are just that. Manufacturers will have to adjust to the high value. The new industries will do so; the metal bashers will die. The reason, of course, is the fundamental strength of the economy. Since he is abroad and unlikely to read this, I don't mind paying a tribute to Gordon Brown's management of the economy, although I would add Eddie George's name as well. We used to think that we had to join the ERM to gain stability and credibility. But we have achieved all that on our own - painfully but still on our own. So there is less urgency to the euro question than people think. The real need is to wait and see whether the euro will stabilise itself around any particular value for even as long as six months. If it settles at $1 and the pound stays at $1.50, that would be the time to join. Until then we can all enjoy our holidays abroad.",
