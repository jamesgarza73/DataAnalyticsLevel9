Lawyers for the Vice-President still believe there is a chance to overturn the certified result in the state and wipe out George W. Bush's slim lead of 537 votes - but time is running out. The Gore team have been pinning their hopes on disputed ballots they claim have either never been counted or unfairly excluded. Three separate courts - the US Supreme Court and two in Tallahassee - are making the rulings that should finally end the electoral confusion, possibly by the middle of this week. The man who could effectively decide who the next President of the United States should be is a droll, folksy, 59-year-old judge who would probably rather have spent his Saturday afternoon chatting to his buddies in the sports bar down the road. Judge N. Sanders Sauls made it clear that he wanted to rule swiftly on Gore's challenge when he told lawyers acting for Gore and Bush: 'Let's slim it down and get all the fluff off.' At issue are around 14,000 disputed ballots from Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties. The Gore team argued yesterday that around 10,000 votes from heavily Democratic Miami-Dade were never counted, having been rejected by the vote-counting machine, and that about 4,000 votes from Palm Beach were wrongly excluded from a manual recount. They believe that these votes could put Gore comfortably ahead. Barry Richard, a local lawyer acting for Bush, protested that there was no case to try: 'It is unreasonable and contrary to the law.' Expert witness Kimball Brace of Election Data Service, told the court a manual hand count was 'the only way of knowing exactly how many votes were cast for each candidate'. The Bush team's position is that machine counts are more accurate. Another legal battle that will be decided in Tallahassee on Wednesday could tip the balance to Gore. Individual voters from Seminole County will argue that Republican officials there illegally added voter identification numbers to absentee ballots that would otherwise have been excluded. Judge Nikki Clark could agree with the voters and throw out all the disputed ballots in that county, effectively putting Al Gore into the lead by around 4,000 votes.

      "body": "<p>As Michael Portillo surveyed the chic Belgravia ballroom, with its swirl of designer dresses and plentiful trays of champagne, he could have been forgiven a quiet feeling of satisfaction. In certain well-heeled circles, Kensington and Chelsea Conservative Association's annual winter ball is still a hot ticket, and their MP of only a year's standing could certainly draw a crowd.</p> <p>But as the Shadow Chancellor circled the room making small talk last Tuesday night, he had no idea his guests would be reading of his apparently imminent political demise over their breakfast tables the next morning. It was a bizarre twist in the increasingly fraught plot unfolding around the Tory party as it stumbles from crisis to crisis. The climax already appears to be clear: a long period more in opposition.</p> <p>After three years with William Hague at the helm, the party still languishes more or less where it started in the opinion polls, and the chatter in Westminster tearooms has again been of leadership challenges after an election Tory MPs expect to lose.</p> <p>Old wounds over Europe are gaping again too. But what really tipped the party over the edge this time was the decision, with the patient already critical, to indulge in a little more bloodletting. Thus the Daily Telegraph unusually devoted its entire front page on Wednesday to a single story: the breathless announcement that Portillo had lost the stomach for politics and was considering giving up. Far from challenging Hague for the crown, it suggested, he might just limp off into the sunset.</p> <p>Portillo, who had been approached with what he thought were routine questions about his ambitions, was quoted as protesting that he did not want to be leader, though he was not leaving either. But such is the power the rightwing press now wields over the Tories that the damage was already done. The Daily Mail gleefully pondered the state of his marriage, TV pundits the state of his mind. He even suffered the indignity of his old foe Ann Widdecombe rallying generously to his defence.</p> <p>But has Portillo really had a dark night of the soul, or was it, as his allies muttered, more a night of the long knives, with friends of Hague finally striking at the leader's rival? And had Portillo's calls for tolerance on sexuality and race made him easy pickings?</p> <p>'For once I think Michael has been more sinned against than sinning - or more spun against than spinning,' said one Tory front bench source.</p> <p>'Suppose he did decide to stand down - six months before an election - would the party really be strengthened? The Praetorian Guard around William are working not for the party but for the leader. They are not thinking of the good of the party.'</p> <p>Central Office, of course, flatly denies involvement. But impeccably-placed voices have been whispering to right-wing commentators for weeks that Portillo was restless and unhappy. Then they struck gold with the Telegraph. And as Shadow Cabinet members point out, for the Hague camp even to be suspected of being behind the attacks is a worrying sign.</p> <p>Portillo, like many of his colleagues, has not much enjoyed opposition. Shadow Ministers say he misses the retinue of civil servants he commanded in government, and after basking in press attention during his parliamentary exile does not like his initiatives as Shadow Chancellor going relatively unnoticed. 'He isn't used to negative press and he doesn't like it,' says one.</p> <p>His reincarnation as a cheerleader for compassion has alienated the Sun and the Mail , which turned squeamish when he admitted past gay experiences: the Telegraph's editor Charles Moore, official biographer of Margaret Thatcher, was apparently struck by her dismissal of her former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 as 'confused'.</p> <p>Nor have the enemies he made in government forgotten. MPs tell the tale of how Portillo once strode into a Commons dining room to find the only Tory table occupied by John Major and a handful of intimates. Snubbed by those who once regarded him as a 'bastard' over Europe, Portillo was apparently reduced to sitting on his own until a bunch of pitying New Labour women asked him to join them.</p> <p>But friends insist he is tough enough to take it. 'Some of his old supporters might be confused, but he isn't confused about himself,' said one. 'He is bigger than a little bit of sniping, and well-schooled enough to know it would come.'</p> <p>And the Tories might well have weathered one storm last week, if another shiver had not run down their spines. Again, the cause was an attempt at political assassination.</p> <p>Tomorrow night, the MP Ian Taylor faces an attempt to deselect him purely because of his pro-European views. If successful, it will be the first time in nearly 50 years a Tory MP has been dumped on political grounds alone.</p> <p>The vote in Taylor's rock-solid Surrey seat of Esher and Walton was triggered by a 70-year-old local activist, Pamela Normington, who raised a petition urging he be ousted for 'repeated rejection of Conservative Party policy on Europe' and membership of the cross-party pressure group Britain in Europe. She has said she regards his views as 'heresy'.</p> <p>Theoretically, only an earthquake should shift an MP such as Taylor, who has represented part of the Surrey gin-and-Jag belt, for 13 years. Married to the daughter of a Tory peer, he was a Science Minister under John Major.</p> <p>He has spoken up for tolerance, warning against the 'politics of the cheap thrill'. Even his detractors say he is a decent, conscientious man.</p> <p>But there are nearly 3,000 members of the ferociously Eurosceptic Democracy Movement in the Esher area, many of them party members. If they pack the meeting, Taylor could just lose, leaving him dependent on a postal ballot of the entire localmembership to save him.</p> <p>Backbenchers fear a witch-hunt of outspoken pro-Europeans, such as former Ministers Ken Clarke and David Curry, could follow. 'If Ian went down, I am sure they will look for someone else next,' said one senior backbencher.</p> <p>'This is an issue that affects every single MP in the Conservative Party today, not just pro-Europeans. If this goes ahead, are we then going to deselect Ann Widdecombe because she is opposed to hunting? Are they going to deselect people because they have voted to lower the age of consent for homosexuals to 16?'</p> <p>Central Office firmly expects Taylor to survive, but he will become a renewed target at the general election. The Democracy Movement is sharpening its claws for an attempt to prevent moderate MPs getting back into parliament.</p> <p>From February it will begin targeting MPs, particularly in marginal seats, who support ratification of the next EU treaty on enlargement. Their constituents will be bombarded with posters and letters warning that the candidate would betray them to Brussels.</p> <p>'We will be putting out stuff in their constituency, saying if you don't want these powers to be transferred to Brussels then don't re-elect John Gummer, or whoever - give your support to a candidate committed to having a referendum on the Nice treaty,' said a spokesman.</p> <p>Eurosceptics used similar tactics to devastating effect in 1997, driving a wedge between the two Tory camps and creating a climate of fear. It is the last thing Hague needs in 2001.</p> <p>The difference between the Esher coup attempt and the demolition job on Portillo, however, is that the former may prove an unexpectedly healing experience. Arch-eurosceptics such as Iain Duncan-Smith, Francis Maude and Angela Browning have all written letters supporting Taylor, despite disagreeing with his views. 'They make it clear the party cannot deselect on the grounds of political views because it would be a lesser party,' Taylor told The Observer .</p> <p>No doubt they also know that Eurosceptics too could become targets if such a precedent were set. Oddly, the attack on Taylor may have united Tory MPs seeking their own survival.</p> <p>'I genuinely think this has been a salutary experience,' said one senior MP.</p> <p>'People have stared over a new abyss and thought, \"Do we want to be like Labour in the Eighties? - No\". As long as Ian wins, it will all go away. But if he loses, it is really, really serious.'</p> <p>But those same survival instincts are now telling Tory MPs that, based on the current poll ratings, they are not going into government for a long time. Their careers - and even their seats - are at stake. Which means the struggle for the leadership will not go away.</p> <p>Some Shadow Ministers insist the conspiracy theorists got carried away last week, and that the Portillo and Hague camps have both learnt their lessons from the bitter Major era.</p> <p>'Charles Moore has been hostile to Michael ever since Michael revealed he was gay, unfortunately,' said one Shadow Cabinet source. 'But I don't actually believe either Michael or William want to play that game.'</p> <p>Others point out that Portillo himself is hardly an innocent abroad. Several opponents blame him for encouraging unattributed briefings against them. But both sides know that any talk of rifts, whoever inspires them, is harmful.</p> <p>'There has been a lot of talk of briefing against Michael for a long time now. Even the fact that it is believed to be happening is very grave,' said one source. 'We need to get a grip.'</p> <p>Significantly, that warning was echoed last week by the 1922 committee, the Tories' men in grey suits empowered to offer leaders a pearl-handled revolver, if necessary, for the good of the party.</p> <p>When the little-known international development spokesman, Gary Streeter, a devout Christian and a somewhat unworldly politician, volunteered in a TV interview to be shown today that the Tories would probably lose next May, he was only saying publicly what most think in private.</p> <p>Meanwhile the Portillo-Hague pantomime plays on to packed houses: this Tuesday the two men will jointly launch an initiative on economic policy. The date was arranged before the current row erupted, but will still be interpreted as a new attempt to bury the hatchet</p> <p>At the Centre for Policy Studies on the same night leading Tory thinkers, including the Shadow Social Security Secretary David Willetts, and Portillo's biographer Michael Gove, will debate the inflammatory question of 'mods versus rockers': social liberals such as Portillo against traditional right-wingers like Widdecombe. Willetts is expected to stick safely to arguing for a 'third way' between the two, which is just what most Tory voters probably want.</p> <p>Two months ago, it looked as though William Hague could provide them with this. But if the Tories do receive a drubbing at the ballot box, restless party members may start to look elsewhere.</p>",

Even his detractors say he is a decent, conscientious man. But there are nearly 3,000 members of the ferociously Eurosceptic Democracy Movement in the Esher area, many of them party members. If they pack the meeting, Taylor could just lose, leaving him dependent on a postal ballot of the entire localmembership to save him. Backbenchers fear a witch-hunt of outspoken pro-Europeans, such as former Ministers Ken Clarke and David Curry, could follow. 'If Ian went down, I am sure they will look for someone else next,' said one senior backbencher. 'This is an issue that affects every single MP in the Conservative Party today, not just pro-Europeans. If this goes ahead, are we then going to deselect Ann Widdecombe because she is opposed to hunting? Are they going to deselect people because they have voted to lower the age of consent for homosexuals to 16?' Central Office firmly expects Taylor to survive, but he will become a renewed target at the general election. The Democracy Movement is sharpening its claws for an attempt to prevent moderate MPs getting back into parliament. From February it will begin targeting MPs, particularly in marginal seats, who support ratification of the next EU treaty on enlargement. Their constituents will be bombarded with posters and letters warning that the candidate would betray them to Brussels. 'We will be putting out stuff in their constituency, saying if you don't want these powers to be transferred to Brussels then don't re-elect John Gummer, or whoever - give your support to a candidate committed to having a referendum on the Nice treaty,' said a spokesman. Eurosceptics used similar tactics to devastating effect in 1997, driving a wedge between the two Tory camps and creating a climate of fear. It is the last thing Hague needs in 2001. The difference between the Esher coup attempt and the demolition job on Portillo, however, is that the former may prove an unexpectedly healing experience. Arch-eurosceptics such as Iain Duncan-Smith, Francis Maude and Angela Browning have all written letters supporting Taylor, despite disagreeing with his views. 'They make it clear the party cannot deselect on the grounds of political views because it would be a lesser party,' Taylor told The Observer . No doubt they also know that Eurosceptics too could become targets if such a precedent were set. Oddly, the attack on Taylor may have united Tory MPs seeking their own survival. 'I genuinely think this has been a salutary experience,' said one senior MP. 'People have stared over a new abyss and thought, \"Do we want to be like Labour in the Eighties? - No\". As long as Ian wins, it will all go away. But if he loses, it is really, really serious.' But those same survival instincts are now telling Tory MPs that, based on the current poll ratings, they are not going into government for a long time. Their careers - and even their seats - are at stake. Which means the struggle for the leadership will not go away. Some Shadow Ministers insist the conspiracy theorists got carried away last week, and that the Portillo and Hague camps have both learnt their lessons from the bitter Major era. 'Charles Moore has been hostile to Michael ever since Michael revealed he was gay, unfortunately,' said one Shadow Cabinet source. 'But I don't actually believe either Michael or William want to play that game.' Others point out that Portillo himself is hardly an innocent abroad. Several opponents blame him for encouraging unattributed briefings against them. But both sides know that any talk of rifts, whoever inspires them, is harmful. 'There has been a lot of talk of briefing against Michael for a long time now. Even the fact that it is believed to be happening is very grave,' said one source. 'We need to get a grip.' Significantly, that warning was echoed last week by the 1922 committee, the Tories' men in grey suits empowered to offer leaders a pearl-handled revolver, if necessary, for the good of the party. When the little-known international development spokesman, Gary Streeter, a devout Christian and a somewhat unworldly politician, volunteered in a TV interview to be shown today that the Tories would probably lose next May, he was only saying publicly what most think in private. Meanwhile the Portillo-Hague pantomime plays on to packed houses: this Tuesday the two men will jointly launch an initiative on economic policy. The date was arranged before the current row erupted, but will still be interpreted as a new attempt to bury the hatchet At the Centre for Policy Studies on the same night leading Tory thinkers, including the Shadow Social Security Secretary David Willetts, and Portillo's biographer Michael Gove, will debate the inflammatory question of 'mods versus rockers': social liberals such as Portillo against traditional right-wingers like Widdecombe. Willetts is expected to stick safely to arguing for a 'third way' between the two, which is just what most Tory voters probably want. Two months ago, it looked as though William Hague could provide them with this. But if the Tories do receive a drubbing at the ballot box, restless party members may start to look elsewhere.",

It includes General Colin Powell, former Secretary of State James Baker, Pentagon official Paul Wolfowitz and National Security aide Condoleeza Rice. From his father's domestic team, Bush has former Federal Reserve appointee Lawrence Summers, and faithful soldier Andrew Card to be his Chief of Staff - of whom one aide said: 'At least he's not a Texan.'</p> <p>Then there is the overlapping circle of investors and corporate barons made rich by Bush's father, collected into the Carlyle Group, a cabalistic, Washington-based merchant bank chaired by Ronald Reagan's former Pentagon chief, Frank Carlucci.

But behind the figureheads are other faces - the hardline Texan managers of the most disciplined and lavishly funded political campaign in recent history.</p> <p>And behind them are the real power brokers, hands to guide the White House from within the world of business and industry with whom Bush has worked for years, who wield awesome power in American society and owe no debt to compromise.</p> <p>In the capital, the point man works both on stage and behind the scenes. When the Supreme Court convened on Friday, Bush was represented by Theodore Olson, a high-profile attorney and former partner of Kenneth Starr.</p> <p>But, backstage, Olson is the Washingtonian who has kept the right-wing candle burning on the capital's dining circuit during the Clinton years, along with his socialite wife, Barbara. It is intriguing that Bush should have appointed the man who accepted some $2.4 million from the ultra-conservative donor Mellon Scaife for what became known as the Arkansas Project - the conspiracy to launch the Paula Jones lawsuit, to detonate the fruitless Whitewater 'scandal' through paid operatives in Little Rock, and ultimately to force the impeachment of President Clinton. Now Olson has become ambassador inside the Beltway for the state of Texas.</p> <p>To most Washingtonians, Texas - with its 1.4 million children without health insurance, squandered surplus, appalling pollution record, exaggerated school standards, housing crisis and execution factory - is not an alluring model for America.</p> <p>But Bush has, from the beginning, pointed to Texas as the validation of his presidential collateral. And the Bush power base - of his own generation, at least - lies in his fiefdom, in whose image he would forge the nation.</p> <p>Most obviously, Bush will continue to lean on the so-called 'Iron Triangle' of his closest aides throughout his political career. The most visible of these is spokeswoman Karen Hughes, whom CNN's Charles Zewe says 'treats the media like a covey of quail that can be rounded up'.</p> <p>'Bush,' says a Texan Democrat consultant, 'is the boy in the bubble of infotainment.'

He would be the White House 'thought police', with a further role to mediate friction that exists, hidden, between Hughes and the apex of the Iron Triangle, Karl Rove.</p> <p>Rove goes back nearly 30 years in Republican politics, 25 of them with the Bush family. He moved to Texas to work for the then Congressman Bush in 1973. Talking to him is like meeting a robot; it is hard to detect any sign of feeling other than devotion to and control over his current master, for whom he has fought every political campaign. Even Tom Paulen, former chairman of the Texas Republican Party, calls Rove 'a control freak'.</p> <p>Rove was Bush Snr's emissary to his own son. He had the idea 'Dubya' should run 'some time during the 1995 session', he told The Observer - and in this he is more than a political strategist. Rove does not only form part of the Iron Triangle; he welds it to other scaffolding in the Bush political edifice. He is the centre of a nexus that connects not only the gubernatorial machine to Bush Snr, but to the business and party interests that sought out George W. Bush (rather than the other way round) to win back the White House at, literally, any cost.</p> <p>'I never dreamed about being President,' says Bush, 'All of a sudden, people started talking to me about the presidency'. Karl Rove organised the meetings in 1998 that began the Republicans' courting of this real-life Forrest Gump - for a reason.</p> <p>Clinton was regarded as an illegitimate President because he gave certain quarters of American power a hard time - characterised by a new term in the Wall Street lexicon during the aftermath of the election: 'Bush stocks'.</p> <p>'There's been a sigh of relief,' said Larry Smith, an analyst with Sutro in New York. Bush's proclaimed victory was greeted by a sudden leap in the share value of big pharmaceutical companies, big insurers of health care, and the big oil and tobacco companies.</p> <p>While Rove was masterminding Bush's gubernatorial victory of 1994 in Texas, he himself had another job with one of these companies: a paid political intelligence operative for the Philip Morris cigarette company, reporting to another Bush aide, Jack Dillard, ubiquitous tobacco lobbyist.</p> <p>Unlike that of Clinton, Bush's record on tobacco does not displease the industry; he decreed it impossible for the civil lawsuit against tobacco companies to proceed in Texas. 'The prospect of Bill Clinton gone and a Bush presidency makes the tobacco industry almost giddy,' says Martin Feldman, an analyst of the industry for the consultants Salomon Smith and Barney.</p> <p>Corporate delight at the prospect of a Bush team heading for Washington stems from the core political philosophy Bush brings from Texas to Washington, which is also Rove's principal achievement. In Texas legalese it was called 'tort reform'; in Washington it translates as grand-scale deregulation of business, services and industry.</p> <p>Even if a full-blooded Bush agenda is partly clipped by the pall of illegitimacy and the narrowness of his official victory, this is the Texas manifesto the newcomers to Washington will be determined - and likely - to accomplish.</p> <p>It was described to The Observer this last week by a senior White House aide as 'bringing the business special interests into politics so they can take over the regulatory bodies of government and regulate themselves'. For example: the Environmental Protection Agency, the fair trade agencies, the health, safety and 'human resources' executives, the regulation of industry, education, guns, medicine and land use.</p> <p>And so, behind the political 'Iron Triangle' is the real 'Iron Triangle' also lying in wait with Bush - the businessmen.</p> <p>Foremost among these is Don Evans, the rainmaker. Evans, an oil executive from Bush's home town of Midland, Texas, goes back three decades with the governor, who was his childhood friend and confidant. Evans became his presidential campaign chairman, filling the biggest political war chest of all time.</p> <p>He is now tipped by one Republican insider for 'any job he wants' in the White House. Whatever that is, he will be among the most influential politicians in America. The word among Republicans is that Evans may have his eye on the chairmanship of the party's National Committee.</p> <p>Evans represents the industry in which Bush himself began his career, which propels the economy of Texas and was crucial to both his and his father's victories - oil.</p> <p>No industry has a higher stake in 'tort reform' than the drillers of black gold, and few look forward to a deregulating Bush administration more than the executives of the oil industry, which has already been promised almost unfettered exploration and drilling rights.</p> <p>But there are other interests too, and two of them - urban development and health care - combine with oil in another mighty figure in the background of a Bush administration. If he must thank his father for his name, Bush must thank Richard Rainwater for his money.</p> <p>Last year, as he prepared to run for President, Bush liquidated a blind trust he created to hold his assets - many of them in oil, real estate, health care and other companies owned by Rainwater, a contributor to Bush's campaigns and with whose money Bush aquired his windfall stake in the Texas Rangers baseball team.</p> <p>Rainwater is a billionaire buying into beleaguered companies at discount prices and reselling when everyone wants in. But he is also involved in companies, including oil firms, that are heavily regulated with hundreds of millions in government contracts.</p> <p>One, a hospital chain called Columbia/HCA, is the subject of a federal investigation into Medicare fraud. Another, Charter Behavioural Health Systems (in which Bush held investments), is subject to regulatory scrutiny, while another - Crescent Real Estate, which operates mental hospitals - has its multi-million-dollar government input under federal investigation. Rainwater is not himself accused of any misdemeanour, but in each case, the prospect of Bush's promise to privatise and deregulate the health system is a tempting one.</p> <p>Rainwater is most famous for investing the oil wealth of the third point of Bush's business Iron Triangle - the Bass Brothers, builders of the metropolis Fort Worth. He turned the $50 million they invested with him in 1970 to $5 billion in 1986, mainly through timely investing in Texaco oil and Disney.</p> <p>This is how the wheels go round in Texas: in 1997, Governor Bush supported a tax reform Bill aimed to cut, among other things, school property taxes. The reform saved Rainwater's Crescent Real Estate $2.5m.</p> <p>In 1999, Bush rushed through an emergency tax relief package to help independent oil producers as prices slumped. According to state records, the biggest beneficiary was the Pioneer Natural Resources oil company, with a $1m tax break. Filings with the Security Exchange Commission show Rainwater to own 55m shares in Pioneer.</p> <p>The scale model for this entwinement of political and commercial interests was the inclusion of the oil companies in drawing up Texas's clean air regulations last year. The rules were devised by Bush's office in collaboration with Marathon Oil and Exxon, and left companies to set their own standards voluntarily.</p> <p>But while the governor was waiting to sign the new 'self-regulatory' Bill into law, the town of Odessa, Texas, was covered by a pall of black smoke so thick that drivers had to switch on their lights during daylight.</p> <p>Odessa, said Dr David Karman of the Texas Natural Resources Commission, 'was like having an open incinerator in your backyard. Only this incinerator is burning a very large soup of toxic chemicals'.</p> <p>In bringing the politics of Texan non-government into national government, Bush is in perfect harmony with two of his most powerful lieutenants in Congress: Dick Armey, leader of the House, and Tom Delay, the Republicans' feared chief whip.</p> <p>Delay, who led the impeachment of President Clinton and whose office mobilised the baying crowds bussed around Florida last month, is seen as the coming man and leader of the extreme Right, with which Bush must deal. Delay has called the Environmental Protection Agency the 'Gestapo' of government.</p> <p>Armey has likewise attacked what he calls 'government shackles on enterprise'; both men have sworn absolute loyalty to Bush.</p> <p>And as it happens, both men, like George W. Bush, come from Texas. Another Iron Triangle. <br><br><b>Key document</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk/guardian/pdf/1122floridaruling.pdf\">Download the Florida supreme court ruling (pdf file)</a></p> <p><b>Related stories</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,400160,00.html\">Timeline - when will America decide?</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,398516,00.html\">Election glossary</a> <br><a href=\" http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/graphic/0,5543,398700,00.html\">Graphic: Know your chad</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,401153,00.html\">22 November: The chad debate - are dimples Gore's best hope?</a> <br><b>Interactive</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/flash/0,5543,394350,00.html\">Results declared, state by state</a> <br> <b>Local media</b> <br> <a href=\"http://www.herald.com/\" target=\"_new\">Miami Herald</a><br><a href=\"http://www.tdo.com/\" target=\"_new\">Tallahassee Democrat</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.gopbi.com/partners/pbpost/epaper/editions/today/\" target=\"_new\">Palm Beach Post</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.sun-sentinel.com/\">Sun Sentinel</a></p>",

Evans represents the industry in which Bush himself began his career, which propels the economy of Texas and was crucial to both his and his father's victories - oil. No industry has a higher stake in 'tort reform' than the drillers of black gold, and few look forward to a deregulating Bush administration more than the executives of the oil industry, which has already been promised almost unfettered exploration and drilling rights. But there are other interests too, and two of them - urban development and health care - combine with oil in another mighty figure in the background of a Bush administration. If he must thank his father for his name, Bush must thank Richard Rainwater for his money. Last year, as he prepared to run for President, Bush liquidated a blind trust he created to hold his assets - many of them in oil, real estate, health care and other companies owned by Rainwater, a contributor to Bush's campaigns and with whose money Bush aquired his windfall stake in the Texas Rangers baseball team. Rainwater is a billionaire buying into beleaguered companies at discount prices and reselling when everyone wants in. But he is also involved in companies, including oil firms, that are heavily regulated with hundreds of millions in government contracts. One, a hospital chain called Columbia/HCA, is the subject of a federal investigation into Medicare fraud. Another, Charter Behavioural Health Systems (in which Bush held investments), is subject to regulatory scrutiny, while another - Crescent Real Estate, which operates mental hospitals - has its multi-million-dollar government input under federal investigation. Rainwater is not himself accused of any misdemeanour, but in each case, the prospect of Bush's promise to privatise and deregulate the health system is a tempting one. Rainwater is most famous for investing the oil wealth of the third point of Bush's business Iron Triangle - the Bass Brothers, builders of the metropolis Fort Worth. He turned the $50 million they invested with him in 1970 to $5 billion in 1986, mainly through timely investing in Texaco oil and Disney. This is how the wheels go round in Texas: in 1997, Governor Bush supported a tax reform Bill aimed to cut, among other things, school property taxes. The reform saved Rainwater's Crescent Real Estate $2.5m. In 1999, Bush rushed through an emergency tax relief package to help independent oil producers as prices slumped. According to state records, the biggest beneficiary was the Pioneer Natural Resources oil company, with a $1m tax break. Filings with the Security Exchange Commission show Rainwater to own 55m shares in Pioneer. The scale model for this entwinement of political and commercial interests was the inclusion of the oil companies in drawing up Texas's clean air regulations last year. The rules were devised by Bush's office in collaboration with Marathon Oil and Exxon, and left companies to set their own standards voluntarily. But while the governor was waiting to sign the new 'self-regulatory' Bill into law, the town of Odessa, Texas, was covered by a pall of black smoke so thick that drivers had to switch on their lights during daylight. Odessa, said Dr David Karman of the Texas Natural Resources Commission, 'was like having an open incinerator in your backyard. Only this incinerator is burning a very large soup of toxic chemicals'. In bringing the politics of Texan non-government into national government, Bush is in perfect harmony with two of his most powerful lieutenants in Congress: Dick Armey, leader of the House, and Tom Delay, the Republicans' feared chief whip. Delay, who led the impeachment of President Clinton and whose office mobilised the baying crowds bussed around Florida last month, is seen as the coming man and leader of the extreme Right, with which Bush must deal. Delay has called the Environmental Protection Agency the 'Gestapo' of government. Armey has likewise attacked what he calls 'government shackles on enterprise'; both men have sworn absolute loyalty to Bush. And as it happens, both men, like George W. Bush, come from Texas.

Mussing her hair until it hangs around her face in a tangled bush? Smearing her lipstick, ripping her clothes, smoking herself hoarse, cultivating trackmarks? For Crawford has been charged with one of the most heinous of modern fashion crimes, she is, some whisper, 'boringly beautiful'. Revlon, who used Crawford as its 'face' for over a decade, has just retired her, though the word 'boring' was kept well out of it. Nor was her age - 34 - cited as the primary reason for the dismissal. </p> <p>A spokesman said: 'It's not that Cindy is getting old, but it's time to move on. Her replacement will not necessarily be younger, but will be different.' In a twisted way, this statement seemed to comprise the exact photo-negative of Isabella Rossellini's dismissal, at 40, from Lanc\u00f4me. Then, it might as well have said: 'Isabella's replacement will not necessarily be different, but will be younger.' Now it seems that getting old is not the greatest mistake a beautiful woman can make. You can be 'boring', too. Interestingly, Liz Hurley might soon lose her contract with Este\u00e9 Lauder for the opposite reason. It would appear that, in America, all that slithering about with pythons has given our Liz a racey image that even 18 years' hard labour sleeping with Hugh Grant just can't shake. Again, it has been stressed that age is not the issue. Of course, whatever they say, age is the issue, though perhaps not the only one. </p> <p>The fact is, these days, both Crawford and Hurley look 'dated' simply because they look pampered and confident. Glossy hair, healthy skin, toned bodies - it's all so last century, darling! Where's the vulnerability, where's the scent of early-death, where's the 'edge' that makes a woman stand out in a crowd? Without these 'stylish attributes', even the most beautiful women are doomed to resemble painted anachronisms in these post-Angeline Jolie times. Jolie, you will remember, is the actress who won an Oscar for her role as a gorgeous, mentally unstable teenager in Girl, Interrupted, a movie about gorgeous, mentally unstable teenage girls. Watching this movie, one rather got the impression that if there were any non-gorgeous, mentally unstable teenage girls out there, it would be some time before we got to hear about them. </p> <p>Of course, in fact and fiction, mental instability in females has always seemed to have a quasi-pornographic charge all of its own. And that goes for both sexes. Stanley just wouldn't have been so interested in raping Blanche if she hadn't been so sexily unhinged that a man couldn't be trusted to keep his trousers on. All those schoolgirls probably wouldn't still be gobbling up their Sylvia Plath, all these years on, if her final poetic gesture hadn't been laying her head gently down in a gas oven. Frances Farmer never made a decent movie in her life, but few would deny that she was 'an absolute triumph' in the loony bin. What seems different now, is how immature these new screwed-up style icons are. From Elizabeth Wurtzel on, female nut-jobs just seem to be getting younger and younger, as they sashay, hollow-eyed and apparently bi-polar, around our movie screens, our bookshelves, and - natch - our catwalks. </p> <p>Truth is, the old-style female psychopaths just wouldn't be able to cut it, these days: Sylvia Plath - talented, but a bit frumpy; Frances Farmer - a bit long in the tooth by the time she finally went loco; Blanche Dubois - oh, please, what's sexy about the insane middle-age? Youth increasingly is the key, which doesn't seem to be worrying people quite as much as it should. Before society's unquenchable hunger for new female meat seemed sated by the Lolita syndrome - all those box-fresh child-women, tripping about in their baby-doll nighties, looking both knowing and innocent. Now it seems they must look deranged, too. In an age where cutting, self-harm and suicide are swiftly replacing anorexia and other food disorders as the prime cause for concern in young females, it seems remarkable that the sexualisation of youthful mental illness in the glamour industries has not been addressed. </p> <p>Once upon a time, Bill Clinton was moved to comment on the heroin-chic allegedly infesting the modelling industry. Here, in Britain, a government inquiry was conducted over the extreme skinniness of models and the damaging effect this might be having on impressionable teenage girls. </p> <p>What nobody seems to be mentioning, or, for that matter, noticing, is how, increasingly, it seems the height of chic to waft about, seeming Not Quite Sane.

      "body": "<p>From her bedroom window , Dorcas Fayemi can see the mouth of the stinking, filthy alleyway into which her grandson, Damilola Taylor, crawled and died last Monday.</p> <p>At 4.30pm that afternoon, as the winter sun set, Damilola popped into the local library to pick up two friends and started to stroll home. Minutes afterwards, with blood pumping from a stab wound to his inner thigh, the 10-year-old was dragging himself through the concrete labyrinth of his south London housing estate, struggling desperately to reach home. He never made it.</p> <p>The thick, weaving trail of blood left by the dying boy shows that he almost reached the top of his street - Blake's Road, a wide, well-lit street just 100 yards from where his grandmother sat waiting for him - but veered off instead into a dark stairwell. He pulled his failing body up two flights of stairs towards a walkway which led circuitiously towards his home but collapsed in the dank stairwell, against heaps of fetid rubbish and the stench of urine.</p> <p>Had Damilola struggled just a few yards further, he would have passed busy council offices. Had he run out into Blake's Road it is more than likely that a passing neighbour would have rushed to his aid. But locals are certain that the dying boy opted for the longer, more isolated route home because he was trying to escape. They believe that, not content with stabbing Damilola, his attackers then chased the boy through the streets. In a desperate attempt to get away, the terrified child bolted into the isolated, knife-scarred and graffiti-stained stairwell, unwittingly signing his own death warrant.</p> <p>'The sight of that alleyway haunts me,' said his grandmother last week, moving aside her thin purple curtains and gazing desolutely down from her fourth-floor window. 'Oh my God, the thought of my boy trying to get to me and me not knowing to help him. How can I live with that? How can his mother?'</p> <p>Damilola was seen at 4.45pm on Monday afternoon walking home by a local woman. Just four minutes afterwards he was discovered by a group of local builders, drenched with his own blood and already unconscious. One man cradled the boy in his arms, another tried to stem the flow of blood and a third ran for an ambulance. It was too late. By the time he reached King's College hospital, Damilola was dead.</p> <p>'I had only just got to know him, and how he's gone,' said Dorcas, pacing her spotlessly clean but strikingly empty flat, where she has lived for nine years.</p> <p>Before Damilola moved in with his family four months ago, it had been almost two decades since Dorcas had seen Gloria Taylor, her husband's sister, and her family, but she treasured the regular photographs and telephone calls she received from Nigeria in lieu of the aeroplane ticket she could not afford. 'Every day for t0 years I've been wanting to see Dammy. Ever since the day he was born,' she said. 'When Gloria asked to come and live with me, I was so happy - you should have seen me laugh. Dammy would have been 11 next week. A few days ago I was planning his birthday and now look. You know you're in London when the poorest people are kicked when they're down as far as they can go already. It makes me sick.'</p> <p>Damilola, youngest son of Gloria, a bank manager, and Richard Taylor, a personnel chief in the Ministry of Defence in control of an office in the new captial of Abuja, was born in Lagos on 12 December 1989. His siblings, Olugbemisolara, 23, and Tunde, 21, were born in England and lived for 10 years in the commuter suburb of Uxbridge. The family returned to Nigeria in 1982 after their father's fledgling business failed.</p> <p>They returned to Britain two years ago after the drug which controlled Beme's acute epilepsy became almost impossible to obtain in Nigeria. Gloria spent most of her wages trying to buy the medication on the black market but soon Beme was suffering to two or three fits every day and was unable to walk.</p> <p>'The family was desperate,' said a friend. 'They knew the sacrifices they would have to make to send Beme to Britain where she could get the medication for free but they had no doubt that it was worth it. It's the African way: the family comes before anything.'</p> <p>After scrimping and saving, selling their car and forgoing every unnecessary expenditure for over two years, the Taylors raised the \u00a35,000 they needed to send Gloria and her children to London. Richard was to stay in Lagos but would fly to England regularly to visit.</p> <p>On 4 August, Richard waved goodbye to his wife and children, gritting his teeth against the separation but already planning a Christ mas visit. 'All Dammy knew of England was what he had seen on the television,' he said yesterday. 'So I took out a globe and pointed out London and told him all about the place I remembered. Of course I didn't warn him about gangs and violence. I never saw anything like that in Uxbridge. London seemed a very safe place and so when Dammy went there he was enthusiastic. Very excited.'</p> <p>But despite the hope and optimism, in the months leading up to the murder of her youngest son, Gloria found modern-day London a gut-wrenching shock. The family moved into the three-bedroomed Southwark council flat which Dorcas shared with her 29-year-old son, Jordan Sayemi, on the top floor of Grovesnor Grove estate, the roughest in a group of five which together harbour one of the most violent reputations in London. The rundown flat is officially uninhabitable.</p> <p>Gloria stuck with her new way of life for the improvement she saw in her daughter's health, but family conversations were littered with references to returning home.</p> <p>Almost 70 per cent of households in the area comprising Gloucester Grove, North Peckham, Camden, Sumnar and Willowbrook estates are occupied by people from ethnic minorities. Almost half of the local children live in single-parent families and a quarter struggle by on less than \u00a3100 a week. The borough is the third most violent in London: more than 850 violent offences ranging from murder to mugging were reported last October alone, although locals estimate the actual number at three or four times higher.</p> <p>From their comfortable house in Isahi, Gloria now found herself sleeping on a sofa, while her two sons lay on the floor beside her.

      "bodyText": "From her bedroom window , Dorcas Fayemi can see the mouth of the stinking, filthy alleyway into which her grandson, Damilola Taylor, crawled and died last Monday. At 4.30pm that afternoon, as the winter sun set, Damilola popped into the local library to pick up two friends and started to stroll home. Minutes afterwards, with blood pumping from a stab wound to his inner thigh, the 10-year-old was dragging himself through the concrete labyrinth of his south London housing estate, struggling desperately to reach home. He never made it. The thick, weaving trail of blood left by the dying boy shows that he almost reached the top of his street - Blake's Road, a wide, well-lit street just 100 yards from where his grandmother sat waiting for him - but veered off instead into a dark stairwell. He pulled his failing body up two flights of stairs towards a walkway which led circuitiously towards his home but collapsed in the dank stairwell, against heaps of fetid rubbish and the stench of urine. Had Damilola struggled just a few yards further, he would have passed busy council offices. Had he run out into Blake's Road it is more than likely that a passing neighbour would have rushed to his aid. But locals are certain that the dying boy opted for the longer, more isolated route home because he was trying to escape. They believe that, not content with stabbing Damilola, his attackers then chased the boy through the streets. In a desperate attempt to get away, the terrified child bolted into the isolated, knife-scarred and graffiti-stained stairwell, unwittingly signing his own death warrant. 'The sight of that alleyway haunts me,' said his grandmother last week, moving aside her thin purple curtains and gazing desolutely down from her fourth-floor window. 'Oh my God, the thought of my boy trying to get to me and me not knowing to help him. How can I live with that? How can his mother?' Damilola was seen at 4.45pm on Monday afternoon walking home by a local woman. Just four minutes afterwards he was discovered by a group of local builders, drenched with his own blood and already unconscious. One man cradled the boy in his arms, another tried to stem the flow of blood and a third ran for an ambulance. It was too late. By the time he reached King's College hospital, Damilola was dead. 'I had only just got to know him, and how he's gone,' said Dorcas, pacing her spotlessly clean but strikingly empty flat, where she has lived for nine years. Before Damilola moved in with his family four months ago, it had been almost two decades since Dorcas had seen Gloria Taylor, her husband's sister, and her family, but she treasured the regular photographs and telephone calls she received from Nigeria in lieu of the aeroplane ticket she could not afford. 'Every day for t0 years I've been wanting to see Dammy. Ever since the day he was born,' she said. 'When Gloria asked to come and live with me, I was so happy - you should have seen me laugh. Dammy would have been 11 next week. A few days ago I was planning his birthday and now look. You know you're in London when the poorest people are kicked when they're down as far as they can go already. It makes me sick.' Damilola, youngest son of Gloria, a bank manager, and Richard Taylor, a personnel chief in the Ministry of Defence in control of an office in the new captial of Abuja, was born in Lagos on 12 December 1989. His siblings, Olugbemisolara, 23, and Tunde, 21, were born in England and lived for 10 years in the commuter suburb of Uxbridge. The family returned to Nigeria in 1982 after their father's fledgling business failed. They returned to Britain two years ago after the drug which controlled Beme's acute epilepsy became almost impossible to obtain in Nigeria. Gloria spent most of her wages trying to buy the medication on the black market but soon Beme was suffering to two or three fits every day and was unable to walk. 'The family was desperate,' said a friend. 'They knew the sacrifices they would have to make to send Beme to Britain where she could get the medication for free but they had no doubt that it was worth it. It's the African way: the family comes before anything.' After scrimping and saving, selling their car and forgoing every unnecessary expenditure for over two years, the Taylors raised the \u00a35,000 they needed to send Gloria and her children to London. Richard was to stay in Lagos but would fly to England regularly to visit. On 4 August, Richard waved goodbye to his wife and children, gritting his teeth against the separation but already planning a Christ mas visit. 'All Dammy knew of England was what he had seen on the television,' he said yesterday. 'So I took out a globe and pointed out London and told him all about the place I remembered. Of course I didn't warn him about gangs and violence. I never saw anything like that in Uxbridge. London seemed a very safe place and so when Dammy went there he was enthusiastic. Very excited.' But despite the hope and optimism, in the months leading up to the murder of her youngest son, Gloria found modern-day London a gut-wrenching shock. The family moved into the three-bedroomed Southwark council flat which Dorcas shared with her 29-year-old son, Jordan Sayemi, on the top floor of Grovesnor Grove estate, the roughest in a group of five which together harbour one of the most violent reputations in London. The rundown flat is officially uninhabitable. Gloria stuck with her new way of life for the improvement she saw in her daughter's health, but family conversations were littered with references to returning home. Almost 70 per cent of households in the area comprising Gloucester Grove, North Peckham, Camden, Sumnar and Willowbrook estates are occupied by people from ethnic minorities. Almost half of the local children live in single-parent families and a quarter struggle by on less than \u00a3100 a week. The borough is the third most violent in London: more than 850 violent offences ranging from murder to mugging were reported last October alone, although locals estimate the actual number at three or four times higher. From their comfortable house in Isahi, Gloria now found herself sleeping on a sofa, while her two sons lay on the floor beside her. Instead of allowing her children to wander freely at night as they did in Africa, she had to forbid them from even leaving the flat alone after dark. Oliver Goldsmith, the local primary school which Damilola attended, has one of the lowest scores in the national league tables, with three in 10 lessons condemned as unsatisfactory by a recent Ofsted report. The headmaster, Mark Parsons, struggling to defeat the culture of bullying and ungovernable chaos, has expelled more than 150 pupils in the past year, over ten times the national average. One in three of those left have special needs, and just one in four gained the expected standard in English last year. 'I can't believe how much England has changed,' Gloria said, bewildered in the hours after her son's murder. There is no question that life on the five estates in Peckham is of a quality few could bear. Locals openly fear the gangs which roam the neighbourhood, gather in groups of up to 80 in dilapidated stairwells like the one where Damilola went to die. Community leaders complain that the unremitting violence creates a sense of despair which saps youngsters of the desire to achieve anything more. According to local people, Damilola was the vicitim of a new form of intimidation. 'Jucking' - or stabbing opponents once with a blade to intimidate enemies and show off to friends - is now an everyday occurrence on the estates. 'Jucking is so common that the only shocking thing about this incident is that it involved a little kid.

The violence is gruelling and the stress of living in such conditions is unremitting. 'Living in environments like this turns us into second-class citizens, conditioned to violence and squalor,' said Ali Balli, chair of the Gloucester Grove Tenants' Association. The Tory government introduced its Single Regeneration Budget scheme in the mid-Nineties to deal with estates like these. Money was to be ploughed into refurbishing buildings which still had hope, and knocking down the rest to be replaced with high-quality flats. No one on the Peckham estates denies that the regeneration scheme was desperately needed, but official mismanagement, arrogance and poor planning on a massive scale tipped a community already surviving on a tightwire over the edge, generating chaos.

When Chile's former dictator made thousands of political prisoners disappear into the night and fog of his dictatorship, leaving them without a burial, not even in his saddest nightmares could he have anticipated the joke that history was going to play on him: that many years later, those very crimes would lead Judge Guzm\u00e1n to indict him for crimes against humanity.</p> <p>The Chilean judge is able to proceed with Pinochet's trial because last August the supreme court of Chile stripped the general of his self-granted parliamentary immunity by interpreting the disappearance of prisoners as a case of kidnapping.</p> <p>Denying families the bodies of their murdered relatives must have seemed like a brilliant idea to Pinochet and his disciples. The authorities could have their cake and eat it. They could kill their adversaries and not be held accountable, invest themselves with total power over life and death and simultaneously insist that there were no prisoners. Habeas corpus could be rejected because, there was, to put it bluntly, no corpus. Dead or alive. And therefore no evidence and no crime. But there is terror, because everybody in Chile understood what was really happening in nearby basements and remote deserts. Happening interminably.</p> <p>Torture was transformed from something physical into an event that was repeated incessantly in each citizen's inner world, paralysing him or her with fear.</p> <p>Pinochet was sure that he would never be taken to task or brought to trial. He absolved himself of any possible prosecution by dictating an amnesty for whatever crimes could have been committed during the most terrible years of his reign.</p> <p>It is particularly marvellous, then, that it should be precisely those missing and supposedly dead bodies that have come back to haunt Pinochet. To get off the hook, Pinochet will now have to prove that he killed - or ordered the assassination - of the prisoners; he would have to disinter them from their anonymous graves, drag them out of the rivers and the seas where they were cast. Then and only then could his amnesty be applied to him: he would be freed because he had, admittedly, committed murder. Poetic justice indeed.</p> <p>This new development in the Pinochet case is the result of many factors; first and foremost, the unending struggle of the relatives of the missing. And they were accompanied in their search by vast groups of Chileans who understood that while those bodies were not given a funeral, there would be no peace and no reconciliation.</p> <p>We should not forget, however, that this immense social movement had been demanding justice for years without being heard. What jerked the machinery of state into motion, made the democratic government and the judicial system, the army and the right-wing Pinochetistas, react, was the arrest of the General in London by order of the Spanish judge, Baltazar Garz\u00f3n.</p> <p>The shameful fact that the outside world was judging Pinochet while we had been unable to do so, changed the moral climate for good.</p> <p>It is still too early to guess what the repercussions of this decision by Judge Guzm\u00e1n will be, or what pressure the armed forces might exert.</p> <p>But there is already an ethical consequence of enormous importance for every corner of this planet. The strategy of 'disappearing' prisoners, that extreme form of violence that has soiled so many regimes all over the world, has been proven a boomerang.</p> <p>This new victory against impunity belongs, then, above all to our disappeared, los desaparecidos, those men and women arrested one night and who are somehow still alive, beyond death, still accusing the man who thought he could extinguish them.</p> <p><b> The author's latest novel is 'The Nanny and the Iceberg'. </b></p>",

Habeas corpus could be rejected because, there was, to put it bluntly, no corpus. Dead or alive. And therefore no evidence and no crime. But there is terror, because everybody in Chile understood what was really happening in nearby basements and remote deserts. Happening interminably. Torture was transformed from something physical into an event that was repeated incessantly in each citizen's inner world, paralysing him or her with fear. Pinochet was sure that he would never be taken to task or brought to trial. He absolved himself of any possible prosecution by dictating an amnesty for whatever crimes could have been committed during the most terrible years of his reign. It is particularly marvellous, then, that it should be precisely those missing and supposedly dead bodies that have come back to haunt Pinochet. To get off the hook, Pinochet will now have to prove that he killed - or ordered the assassination - of the prisoners; he would have to disinter them from their anonymous graves, drag them out of the rivers and the seas where they were cast. Then and only then could his amnesty be applied to him: he would be freed because he had, admittedly, committed murder. Poetic justice indeed. This new development in the Pinochet case is the result of many factors; first and foremost, the unending struggle of the relatives of the missing. And they were accompanied in their search by vast groups of Chileans who understood that while those bodies were not given a funeral, there would be no peace and no reconciliation. We should not forget, however, that this immense social movement had been demanding justice for years without being heard. What jerked the machinery of state into motion, made the democratic government and the judicial system, the army and the right-wing Pinochetistas, react, was the arrest of the General in London by order of the Spanish judge, Baltazar Garz\u00f3n. The shameful fact that the outside world was judging Pinochet while we had been unable to do so, changed the moral climate for good. It is still too early to guess what the repercussions of this decision by Judge Guzm\u00e1n will be, or what pressure the armed forces might exert. But there is already an ethical consequence of enormous importance for every corner of this planet. The strategy of 'disappearing' prisoners, that extreme form of violence that has soiled so many regimes all over the world, has been proven a boomerang. This new victory against impunity belongs, then, above all to our disappeared, los desaparecidos, those men and women arrested one night and who are somehow still alive, beyond death, still accusing the man who thought he could extinguish them. The author's latest novel is 'The Nanny and the Iceberg'.",

      "bodyText": "A growing wave of vandalism by children who block railway lines with the 'horrifying' amount of trackside debris left by contractors is likely to cause a train crash as disastrous as the Ladbroke Grove tragedy, safety chiefs warned yesterday. Railtrack revealed that more than 20,000 tonnes of rotting concrete and scrap metal has been lying around the network 'since before privatisation', supplying the vandals with potentially lethal missiles and obstacles. The safety authorities accused the company of failing to supervise maintenance suppliers properly, despite repeated orders to them to crack down on carelessness. Railtrack admitted that hundreds of miles of new track now being delivered to replace broken rails such as the one that led to the Hatfield crash last October may now give the vandals extra ammunition. Adrian Ling, a principal railways inspector with the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), told The Observer that increasing vandalism posed a 'very significant threat' to railway safety. 'If a derailment from an act of vandalism led to a train falling from the rails into the path of an oncoming train, we could have consequences as severe as those at Ladbroke Grove,' he said. Thirty-one people died in that accident in October 1999, when two trains collided after one had passed a red signal near London's Paddington station. Young vandals - usually boys between 10 and 15 - have been involved in several serious and 'sinister' incidents recently. One safety industry source said an incident at Kilsby, Northamptonshire, last June, when a Virgin express struck a pile of concrete and other debris piled on the tracks in a tunnel, was 'very, very close to a major accident'.

Ling said: 'Incidents are increasing and there is evidence that their nature is getting more extreme. We have not been satisfied with Railtrack's performance in the past, and it is an issue that has been raised with them on repeated occasions.' Ling said Railtrack was not supervising its contractors sufficiently, and orders from the HSE to improve things usually came after written requests had not been responded to satisfactorily. The vast tonnage of old debris languishing by the tracks ready to be misused was 'absolutely horrifying'. As a result of the recent carpeting by the HSE, Railtrack has signed an agreement with its main contractors to implement Operation Clean Sweep, a \u00a35m programme which aims to clear all trackside debris from 25 top vandalism 'hot spots' by April and across the whole network by autumn 2002. Railtrack and the British Transport Police have campaigned regularly to dissuade young people from hanging around the railways. Decoy trains and helicopters with thermal imaging equipment are used to hunt offenders in the worst-hit areas, mainly around big cities in the North of England, the Midlands and the South.

The attack took place in flats in Sceaux Gardens, a few minutes' walk from where Damilola died.

      "bodyText": "A second Nigerian boy was killed in a stabbing incident just a few hundred yards from the tragic stairwell where Damilola Taylor was found bleeding to death last week. Seventeen-year-old Shola Agora was knifed in a block of flats on the same crime- ridden North Peckham estate, just nine days before Damilola's death. The news came as police announced yesterday that they had arrested two teen-agers and a 39-year-old woman in connection with the murder of Damilola. Shola Agora's body was found in the back of a car in King's College Hospital in south London. The attack took place in flats in Sceaux Gardens, a few minutes' walk from where Damilola died. One youth has already been arrested for the crime. Residents in the area last night described knives as a plague. Local councillors have called for an amnesty for the weapons in local police stations and an increase in beat officers. Vicky Naish, Labour councillor for the ward where Agora died, said: 'Knives and bullying should not be tolerated on the estate and we are doing as much as we can to stamp it out. But everywhere I go tenants have just one main demand: a beat officer on every estate.' Police have now swamped the area around the estate in the hope of finding new witnesses to the crime. Sixteen officers are conducting house-to-house inquiries. The arrests in the Damilola case were made at addresses in south east London in the early hours of the morning. As the three people were being questioned, Richard Taylor, the father of the murdered 10-year-old, paid an emotional visit to the bleak spot where his son was killed. Standing over the site with other family members, Mr Taylor could be heard crying: 'Oh my God, oh my God, my beautiful, beautiful boy.' Superintendent Rod Jarman said: 'This was obviously deeply distressing for the family and we though it best to leave them to their own space. They are extremely upset. If my own son was killed I would want to know where he died.' The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children last night issued results of a survey showing that around 150,000 children have experienced violent attacks using knives and guns. The news of the second death comes as the Government prepares a major clampdown on juvenile crime and anti-social behaviour. The Home Secretary, Jack Straw, will announce on Wednesday that curfews for children under the age of 10 who terrorise local communities will be extended to teenagers. There will also be action against the selling of alcohol to under-age drinkers. Straw will say that he wants to tackle the 'evil of drunkenness' which leads to much of the crime in Britain. Under a separate scheme to be announced by the Government in the next few weeks, children as young as 10 will be forced to sign 'acceptable behaviour contracts'. The contracts will say that the children agree not to vandalise their community, fight or bully other children or swear and spit at adults. The Government hopes that the contracts will be the first step towards stamping out the criminal behaviour indulged in by many young children on rundown estates. If the children do not conform to the contracts then the children's parents could have their tenancy rights to council house accommodation revoked. Children who continually break their contracts will also be subjected to anti-social behaviour orders which have the ultimate sanction of five years in prison.

      "bodyText": "The Tory's position on Europe was dealt a major blow last night after leading business figures in Britain attacked the 'hysterical' language used in the debate over co-operation with the European Union. In a letter in The Observer today five chief executives and chairmen of Britain's leading firms, including Lord Marshall, head of British Airways, say the negative way Europe is discussed is threatening job prospects in Britain. With four days to go before the Nice summit on greater EU integration, the letter will undermine Tory hopes of presenting a united anti-European front to the electorate and will delight Labour pro-Europeans such as Peter Mandelson and Robin Cook. The letter comes as the Government prepares to give up more areas of veto on EU policy in order to protect its 'six red lines', areas of tax and social security law it will not concede to qualified majority voting (QMV). In a Foreign Office briefing document given to The Observer , the Government reveals that it expects to give up between 16 and 30 areas of veto. Under the heading QMV; Current Situation, the report says: 'Fifty plus articles under discussion for possible move to QMV. Firm UK opposition on tax and social security. Likely outcome [to the negotiations on allowing QMV] somewhere between Amsterdam (16 articles moved to QMV) and Maastricht (30).' The document refers to previous summits at Amsterdam and Maastricht where similar subjects were discussed. Foreign Office sources said Britain would move on as many as 25 vetoes at Nice, eight more than the 17 reported last week. Although officials know the Eurosceptic press will leap on the 25 vetoes position as evidence that Britain is losing out to Europe, they point out that The Observer letter shows the Government has powerful business backing for its European policy. Downing Street welcomed the intervention yesterday. The letter says: 'The increasingly hostile and prejudiced reporting of European Union affairs in Britain recently has not helped our efforts to do business for Britain abroad. 'Coverage of issues such as the European Rapid Reaction Force and the run-up to the Nice summit has marked a new low. 'Of course we should have a proper debate in Britain about developments in Europe. But let's have a rational debate based on fact not myth, free of anti-European hysteria - a debate which does Britain credit, not one that embarrasses Britain abroad and damages our economic and business interests.' Although the letter makes particular reference to media reporting, senior pro-European sources said Britain's most important businesses were increasingly frustrated at Tory attempts to undermine Europe. Much of the negative coverage of Britain's agreement to commit troops to the EU's Rapid Reaction Force came after William Hague, the Conservative leader, said such a move threatened the UK's relationship with Nato and America. Polls later showed that despite the hostile coverage a majority of the public supported the moves to closer military co-operation across Europe. Along with Marshall, the letter is signed by Geoff Unwin, chief executive of leading accountancy firm Cap Gemini Ernst and Young, Paul Barron, president of manufacturing firm Alstrom which employs 20,000 people, Sir Richard Needham, deputy chairman of vacuum cleaner firm Dyson, and David Arculus, chairman of water firm Severn Trent. The letter provoked an immediate reaction from the Tories. 'Every time we are accused of being hysterical, what we are saying turns out to be true,' said Shadow Foreign Secretary Francis Maude. 'If you have a full political union, and you have a single currency, and you have what Mr [Romano] Prodi [the head of the European Commission] calls a European Army, and you have a flag and an anthem, and a plan to have a common foreign and defence policy decided by majority voting, then you have something that looks, sounds and is intended to be a state, superimposed over the member states. I don't know a better way to describe that than a superstate.' Yesterday Gordon Brown, the Chancellor, made a rare foray into the European debate when he said in an interview with the Today programme that millions of jobs relied on Britain maintaining a leading role in the European Union. His words will be welcomed by the pro-European members of the Cabinet as a sign that Brown is now more willing to engage in the European debate. The Chancellor has been accused in the past of trying to stifle discussion until after the next election because of fears that it plays badly with the electorate. With the Nice summit to start on Thursday, French President Jacques Chirac was completing his whistle-stop tour of Europe with a visit to Berlin yesterday. France and Germany are locked in a desperate battle over the number of votes each country should have in the Council of Ministers, the EU's decision-making body. Germany, which with 82 million people has the largest population in Europe, wants the summit to consider giving it more votes in the council, a move that is being resisted by France. British officials expressed frustration with the way France, which holds the presidency of the European Union until the beginning of next year, is handling the summit. One, who said that Chirac was known as 'the bulldozer', said that the French had yet to give a definite direction on the problem of voting power even at 'this very late stage'.",

      "body": "<p>In the summer of 1994, Robert Cooper, head of drama at BBC Northern Ireland, asked me to write a serial for television about the Easter Rising and Anglo-Irish war of independence. I agreed. I had written for Robert before and was keen to work with him again. I wrote an outline and was introduced to Malcolm Craddock, the independent producer who made the Sharpe series for ITV. The scripts were duly commissioned.</p> <p>Rebel Heart was obviously an immense and difficult undertaking. As the writer, I would have to find a way to weave complicated personal and political narratives in a way that would engage and satisfy the audience.</p> <p>After a long period of development, Rebel Heart , at a cost of \u00a36m, found a director, John Strickland and went into production last February. It is scheduled for broadcast on BBC1 early in the new year.</p> <p>Obviously, I was aware that in taking on a project about the birth of modern Ireland - living, contentious history whose bitter legacy is with us still - there would be a certain amount of flak. I never believed, however, it would be on such a scale, have such a high degree of orchestration, or have such complex roots.</p> <p>I did not expect, for example, that David Trimble, the First Minister of Northern Ireland and embattled leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, would write to Sir Christopher Bland, chairman of BBC, urging him to ban Rebel Heart , which he described, like all my 'forays into writing', as 'hopelessly one-sided'. I don't know if Trimble has seen any of my previous films or read any of my novels (my last 'foray', The Catastrophist , was nominated for the Whitbread novel prize and won the Belfast City Council literature award). I do know that at the time he wrote he hadn't seen Rebel Heart .</p> <p>So, why is Trimble - with a level of backing from The Daily Telegraph that verges on the hysterical - so agitated?</p> <p>Ostensibly, it is because Rebel Heart lacks balance and I am 'a most unsuitable person' to write such a drama. Where, they ask, is the unionist point of view, overlooking the obvious point that if you write a drama about a nationalist uprising, a war fought by nationalists for the independence of their country, and a civil war fought between those same nationalists, you might, as a dramatist, be tempted to focus on the nationalist story. Had I been asked to write a story about Carson, Craig and the foundation of the northern state, I'd have written from a completely different point of view, though I doubt whether Trimble and the Telegraph would have thought me suitable for that task either. Not fit to write about the nationalist side, not fit to write about the unionist side.</p> <p>Not fit to write, full stop. This is the nub. What Trimble and the Telegraph are saying is nothing less than McCarthyite: only those who pass their political test should be allowed to write. As one Belfast columnist, not noted for his sympathy towards republicanism recently asked: would Trimble object had the drama been written by the IRA informer Sean O'Callaghan, now one of the first minister's advisers?</p> <p>Why am I an 'unsuitable' person? Some personal history here, so old and so often retold in the media that it will be stale to many.</p> <p>Unfortunately, it plays a significant part in the Trimble Rebel Heart drama. In 1974, aged 18 and waiting to take up a place at Queen's University, I was arrested and charged with the killing of an RUC officer during the course of an IRA bank robbery. I was convicted in a no-jury, Diplock court on the sole evidence of one witness who changed her description and evidence three times. The conviction was swiftly overturned by the court of appeal which, back in those conveyor-belt days of criminal justice, did not release very many of those who came before it.</p> <p>After release I came to England, only to be arrested by Special Branch and charged, with 'persons unknown', of conspiring to cause explosions. The case was variously dubbed the Persons Unknown trial or the Anarchists trial - we were all voluble if unsophisticated young enemies of the state, all states. We also had absolutely nothing to do with any explosions. After several months in custody, this charge was dropped and a different conspiracy charge preferred. Opening the Crown's case at the Old Bailey a year later, the prosecutor said we had conspired 'to overthrow society'. The jury acquitted us on all counts.</p> <p>The experience of arrest, imprisonment and trial made several important lasting impressions on me. I developed a deep interest in the operation of the criminal justice system. I went to university at King's College, London, and completed a PhD entitled Enforcing the Law in Revolutionary England: Yorkshire, 1640-1660. Cases of alleged miscarriage of justice had a strong pull for me - I campaigned for the Guildford Four in the 1980s and later collaborated with Paul Hill on his account of his wrongful imprisonment. I also came away with a strengthened view that Britain's involvement in Ireland has been a disaster, that partition was a terrible mistake and that the sooner Ireland was united the sooner its people could get on with the important business of growing up politically and building a modern, secular country.</p> <p>David Trimble and The Daily Telegraph are opposed to such views and that is entirely their right. This does not mean that I support the IRA or the IRA's methods. I reject, completely and emphatically and without any hesitation, the IRA's bombing campaign. Its continuation by those who object to the Good Friday Agreement has not one ounce of legitimacy; it is wrong and immoral.</p> <p>It was opposition to the continuing violence in Ireland that led me, long before it became part of the political lexicon, to support the idea of a peace process. After finishing my PhD in 1987, I began to write. My first novel was pub lished in 1991 and soon, I began to write for newspapers and magazines. One of my first pieces appeared in the Guardian . Headlined, 'Time for Adams to join the top table', it argued that the only way forward now was for talks. For this, I was attacked by pro-unionist writers and academics. There could be no talks with 'the men of violence', only more war.</p> <p>But I was convinced by the early 1990s that Gerry Adams was genuine in wanting an end to the armed conflict. I did not know Adams personally, but I inter viewed him for the Guardian and have met him perhaps half a dozen times since ( The Daily Telegraph and Daily Mail have described me variously as a 'friend' and 'associate' of Gerry Adams - which presumably is news to the Sinn Fein leader). I will not deny that I like him or that I admire his achievement in bringing a political movement that has traditionally believed in armed struggle into the political arena, and I said as much in articles for The Observer , the London Review of Books and elsewhere. This, in Trimble-speak, has made me into 'an active IRA apologist'.</p> <p>Although over the past decade I have written articles and essays about Ireland, I concentrated on my fiction and screenplays. Two more novels followed and several screenplays for film and television. Ireland sometimes features in this work ( A Further Gesture and A Man You Don't Meet Everyday ), and sometimes not ( Face , The Catastrophist and the forthcoming comedy drama Lucky Break , directed by Peter Cattaneo, whose last film was The Full Monty ). But I was increasingly aware that my writing was attracting hostility from those who opposed the republican/nationalist viewpoint. I could not and did not complain about it. Ireland is a sensitive subject; emotions run high on all sides.</p> <p>However, word began to reach me of writers, academics and journalists trying to persuade editors and producers not to commission me.</p> <p>To call it a whispering campaign would be to over-dramatise things. At least until, earlier this year, The Spectator published an extraordinary two-page profile of me, rehearsing a version of my past and a version of my political views. Although I was urged by friends to respond, I refused. I prefer to let my work speak for itself. What's the point in defending a drama my critics claim is one-sided when the public will be able to see it and make up their own minds?</p> <p>Shortly after the profile appeared, Boris Johnson, the editor of The Spectator , called me and asked if I would agree to a discussion with Sean O'Callaghan. It would be completely impartial. I would be free to represent my views. It wasn't his intention 'to get' me, simply to tease out where I stood on Ireland. It would be chaired by a mutually agreed figure in which we all had confidence (Andrew Marr and Neal Ascherson were among the names proposed) and it would just be the three of us with a tape-recorder.</p> <p>Friends warned me against doing it but my argument was that I should engage openly with them.</p> <p>I do not think that Boris Johnson will contradict me if I say that the resulting discussion did not quite work out the way he promised. First to go was the impartial chair. Boris proposed himself. I reluctantly agreed. 'I trust you,' I said. On arriving at the Spectator offices, my alarm bells started ringing. I was shown into a room filled with O'Callaghan's friends and at least one pro-unionist journalist from the Sunday Telegraph . The atmosphere was not entirely friendly. I told Boris this was a breach of our agreement, that I wasn't there to be thrown to the lions. Boris suggested we retire to the library and have the discussion there.</p> <p>It quickly became apparent to me that Boris was less interested in teasing out my views about Ireland than in cross-questioning me on my past. I tried to discuss the historical relationship between Sinn Fein and the IRA and where this relationship stood now; Boris asked me what my problem with the English was. I looked at him amazed. I have lived among the English for more than half my life, my partner is English, our son half-English. I like the English. I can't say I'm an admirer of the empire-building spirit of the past or the racism and snobbery of today. But I do very much admire Englishness that is liberal, ironic, tolerant and humorous.</p> <p>Increasingly exasperated, I talked about the importance of keeping the Good Friday Agree ment going. Boris asked, hypothetically, if I would turn in the people who committed the Omagh outrage. And here I gave what two relatives of victims of the Omagh bomb describe in a letter to the Telegraph in support of the campaign to ban Rebel Heart as 'a pathetic remark'.</p> <p>In full, I said that if there was evidence to bring the bombers to justice, do it. 'Convict them. Absolutely,' I said (this was not reported in the Telegraph ). I also said that I, like any nationalist, would find it difficult to turn someone into the RUC, a force with little or no credit in the eyes of not only nationalists and republicans but many others as well - and of which I have personal experience of interrogation and intimidation - for trial in a no-jury court. Omagh was the most appalling atrocity and I apologise wholeheartedly to the relatives and surviving victims if my remark caused them hurt or offence. I believe those responsible should be brought to account.</p> <p>One day, and I hope that day will be soon, I hope the relatives' search for justice will be fully rewarded.</p> <p>The Spectator 'discussion' is more than merely a sub-plot in the Trimble Rebel Heart drama. It and the way it has been used by the Telegraph demonstrate very important lessons about writing on Ireland. For unionists and those who support them, huge shifts in the political landscape have occurred since I wrote my piece on Adams joining the top table. At the time, republicans were outside the political mainstream. Those who wrote arguing that they should be inside were attacked and caricatured. Now Martin McGuinness is minister of education in a power-sharing government.</p> <p>Most political and journalistic opinion holds, with some reservations, that this is, if not a good thing, at least a pragmatic way forward. Those who have so vociferously attacked me and Rebel Heart now find themselves on the political margins, at least as far as Ireland is concerned. When they want a quote from a Northern Irish politician to condemn Rebel Heart who do they go to? Ian Paisley Jr, one of the most ardent opponents of the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process.</p> <p>Back to Rebel Heart . I don't know how much David Trimble or Charles Moore, the Telegraph editor, know about how drama works. I can tell them this: it does not work if the writer is blinkered, one-sided or tries to beat his audience over the head with a political message. I am not interested in writing placard drama, I am not interested in watching it. Contrary to what they have been saying, Rebel Heart has its own balance.</p> <p>That balance is not found in giving unionists and republicans equal weight (this is a drama about the republican side), but in the arguments between those who ended up wanting to cut a deal and compromise, and those who said let's fight on. In this sense, Rebel Heart has more than historical relevance.</p> <p>I will take no lessons from Charles Moore and The Daily Telegraph about balance. Moore has nailed his political colours to the mast. He has appeared on 'Save the RUC' platforms beside such figures as Vincent McKenna, now in jail for abusing his own daughter; he has placed his paper's coverage of Ireland in the service of one side.</p> <p>It's not a side I support but he has every right to do so. I hope he and Trimble will accept that I have my rights, too.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In the summer of 1994, Robert Cooper, head of drama at BBC Northern Ireland, asked me to write a serial for television about the Easter Rising and Anglo-Irish war of independence. I agreed. I had written for Robert before and was keen to work with him again. I wrote an outline and was introduced to Malcolm Craddock, the independent producer who made the Sharpe series for ITV. The scripts were duly commissioned. Rebel Heart was obviously an immense and difficult undertaking. As the writer, I would have to find a way to weave complicated personal and political narratives in a way that would engage and satisfy the audience. After a long period of development, Rebel Heart , at a cost of \u00a36m, found a director, John Strickland and went into production last February. It is scheduled for broadcast on BBC1 early in the new year. Obviously, I was aware that in taking on a project about the birth of modern Ireland - living, contentious history whose bitter legacy is with us still - there would be a certain amount of flak. I never believed, however, it would be on such a scale, have such a high degree of orchestration, or have such complex roots. I did not expect, for example, that David Trimble, the First Minister of Northern Ireland and embattled leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, would write to Sir Christopher Bland, chairman of BBC, urging him to ban Rebel Heart , which he described, like all my 'forays into writing', as 'hopelessly one-sided'. I don't know if Trimble has seen any of my previous films or read any of my novels (my last 'foray', The Catastrophist , was nominated for the Whitbread novel prize and won the Belfast City Council literature award). I do know that at the time he wrote he hadn't seen Rebel Heart . So, why is Trimble - with a level of backing from The Daily Telegraph that verges on the hysterical - so agitated? Ostensibly, it is because Rebel Heart lacks balance and I am 'a most unsuitable person' to write such a drama. Where, they ask, is the unionist point of view, overlooking the obvious point that if you write a drama about a nationalist uprising, a war fought by nationalists for the independence of their country, and a civil war fought between those same nationalists, you might, as a dramatist, be tempted to focus on the nationalist story. Had I been asked to write a story about Carson, Craig and the foundation of the northern state, I'd have written from a completely different point of view, though I doubt whether Trimble and the Telegraph would have thought me suitable for that task either. Not fit to write about the nationalist side, not fit to write about the unionist side. Not fit to write, full stop. This is the nub. What Trimble and the Telegraph are saying is nothing less than McCarthyite: only those who pass their political test should be allowed to write. As one Belfast columnist, not noted for his sympathy towards republicanism recently asked: would Trimble object had the drama been written by the IRA informer Sean O'Callaghan, now one of the first minister's advisers? Why am I an 'unsuitable' person? Some personal history here, so old and so often retold in the media that it will be stale to many. Unfortunately, it plays a significant part in the Trimble Rebel Heart drama. In 1974, aged 18 and waiting to take up a place at Queen's University, I was arrested and charged with the killing of an RUC officer during the course of an IRA bank robbery. I was convicted in a no-jury, Diplock court on the sole evidence of one witness who changed her description and evidence three times. The conviction was swiftly overturned by the court of appeal which, back in those conveyor-belt days of criminal justice, did not release very many of those who came before it. After release I came to England, only to be arrested by Special Branch and charged, with 'persons unknown', of conspiring to cause explosions. The case was variously dubbed the Persons Unknown trial or the Anarchists trial - we were all voluble if unsophisticated young enemies of the state, all states. We also had absolutely nothing to do with any explosions. After several months in custody, this charge was dropped and a different conspiracy charge preferred. Opening the Crown's case at the Old Bailey a year later, the prosecutor said we had conspired 'to overthrow society'. The jury acquitted us on all counts. The experience of arrest, imprisonment and trial made several important lasting impressions on me. I developed a deep interest in the operation of the criminal justice system. I went to university at King's College, London, and completed a PhD entitled Enforcing the Law in Revolutionary England: Yorkshire, 1640-1660. Cases of alleged miscarriage of justice had a strong pull for me - I campaigned for the Guildford Four in the 1980s and later collaborated with Paul Hill on his account of his wrongful imprisonment. I also came away with a strengthened view that Britain's involvement in Ireland has been a disaster, that partition was a terrible mistake and that the sooner Ireland was united the sooner its people could get on with the important business of growing up politically and building a modern, secular country. David Trimble and The Daily Telegraph are opposed to such views and that is entirely their right. This does not mean that I support the IRA or the IRA's methods. I reject, completely and emphatically and without any hesitation, the IRA's bombing campaign. Its continuation by those who object to the Good Friday Agreement has not one ounce of legitimacy; it is wrong and immoral. It was opposition to the continuing violence in Ireland that led me, long before it became part of the political lexicon, to support the idea of a peace process. After finishing my PhD in 1987, I began to write. My first novel was pub lished in 1991 and soon, I began to write for newspapers and magazines. One of my first pieces appeared in the Guardian . Headlined, 'Time for Adams to join the top table', it argued that the only way forward now was for talks. For this, I was attacked by pro-unionist writers and academics. There could be no talks with 'the men of violence', only more war. But I was convinced by the early 1990s that Gerry Adams was genuine in wanting an end to the armed conflict. I did not know Adams personally, but I inter viewed him for the Guardian and have met him perhaps half a dozen times since ( The Daily Telegraph and Daily Mail have described me variously as a 'friend' and 'associate' of Gerry Adams - which presumably is news to the Sinn Fein leader). I will not deny that I like him or that I admire his achievement in bringing a political movement that has traditionally believed in armed struggle into the political arena, and I said as much in articles for The Observer , the London Review of Books and elsewhere. This, in Trimble-speak, has made me into 'an active IRA apologist'. Although over the past decade I have written articles and essays about Ireland, I concentrated on my fiction and screenplays. Two more novels followed and several screenplays for film and television. Ireland sometimes features in this work ( A Further Gesture and A Man You Don't Meet Everyday ), and sometimes not ( Face , The Catastrophist and the forthcoming comedy drama Lucky Break , directed by Peter Cattaneo, whose last film was The Full Monty ). But I was increasingly aware that my writing was attracting hostility from those who opposed the republican/nationalist viewpoint. I could not and did not complain about it. Ireland is a sensitive subject; emotions run high on all sides. However, word began to reach me of writers, academics and journalists trying to persuade editors and producers not to commission me. To call it a whispering campaign would be to over-dramatise things. At least until, earlier this year, The Spectator published an extraordinary two-page profile of me, rehearsing a version of my past and a version of my political views. Although I was urged by friends to respond, I refused. I prefer to let my work speak for itself. What's the point in defending a drama my critics claim is one-sided when the public will be able to see it and make up their own minds? Shortly after the profile appeared, Boris Johnson, the editor of The Spectator , called me and asked if I would agree to a discussion with Sean O'Callaghan. It would be completely impartial. I would be free to represent my views. It wasn't his intention 'to get' me, simply to tease out where I stood on Ireland. It would be chaired by a mutually agreed figure in which we all had confidence (Andrew Marr and Neal Ascherson were among the names proposed) and it would just be the three of us with a tape-recorder. Friends warned me against doing it but my argument was that I should engage openly with them. I do not think that Boris Johnson will contradict me if I say that the resulting discussion did not quite work out the way he promised. First to go was the impartial chair. Boris proposed himself. I reluctantly agreed. 'I trust you,' I said. On arriving at the Spectator offices, my alarm bells started ringing. I was shown into a room filled with O'Callaghan's friends and at least one pro-unionist journalist from the Sunday Telegraph . The atmosphere was not entirely friendly. I told Boris this was a breach of our agreement, that I wasn't there to be thrown to the lions. Boris suggested we retire to the library and have the discussion there. It quickly became apparent to me that Boris was less interested in teasing out my views about Ireland than in cross-questioning me on my past. I tried to discuss the historical relationship between Sinn Fein and the IRA and where this relationship stood now; Boris asked me what my problem with the English was. I looked at him amazed. I have lived among the English for more than half my life, my partner is English, our son half-English. I like the English. I can't say I'm an admirer of the empire-building spirit of the past or the racism and snobbery of today. But I do very much admire Englishness that is liberal, ironic, tolerant and humorous. Increasingly exasperated, I talked about the importance of keeping the Good Friday Agree ment going. Boris asked, hypothetically, if I would turn in the people who committed the Omagh outrage. And here I gave what two relatives of victims of the Omagh bomb describe in a letter to the Telegraph in support of the campaign to ban Rebel Heart as 'a pathetic remark'. In full, I said that if there was evidence to bring the bombers to justice, do it. 'Convict them. Absolutely,' I said (this was not reported in the Telegraph ). I also said that I, like any nationalist, would find it difficult to turn someone into the RUC, a force with little or no credit in the eyes of not only nationalists and republicans but many others as well - and of which I have personal experience of interrogation and intimidation - for trial in a no-jury court. Omagh was the most appalling atrocity and I apologise wholeheartedly to the relatives and surviving victims if my remark caused them hurt or offence. I believe those responsible should be brought to account. One day, and I hope that day will be soon, I hope the relatives' search for justice will be fully rewarded. The Spectator 'discussion' is more than merely a sub-plot in the Trimble Rebel Heart drama. It and the way it has been used by the Telegraph demonstrate very important lessons about writing on Ireland. For unionists and those who support them, huge shifts in the political landscape have occurred since I wrote my piece on Adams joining the top table. At the time, republicans were outside the political mainstream. Those who wrote arguing that they should be inside were attacked and caricatured. Now Martin McGuinness is minister of education in a power-sharing government. Most political and journalistic opinion holds, with some reservations, that this is, if not a good thing, at least a pragmatic way forward. Those who have so vociferously attacked me and Rebel Heart now find themselves on the political margins, at least as far as Ireland is concerned. When they want a quote from a Northern Irish politician to condemn Rebel Heart who do they go to? Ian Paisley Jr, one of the most ardent opponents of the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process. Back to Rebel Heart . I don't know how much David Trimble or Charles Moore, the Telegraph editor, know about how drama works. I can tell them this: it does not work if the writer is blinkered, one-sided or tries to beat his audience over the head with a political message. I am not interested in writing placard drama, I am not interested in watching it. Contrary to what they have been saying, Rebel Heart has its own balance. That balance is not found in giving unionists and republicans equal weight (this is a drama about the republican side), but in the arguments between those who ended up wanting to cut a deal and compromise, and those who said let's fight on. In this sense, Rebel Heart has more than historical relevance. I will take no lessons from Charles Moore and The Daily Telegraph about balance. Moore has nailed his political colours to the mast. He has appeared on 'Save the RUC' platforms beside such figures as Vincent McKenna, now in jail for abusing his own daughter; he has placed his paper's coverage of Ireland in the service of one side. It's not a side I support but he has every right to do so. I hope he and Trimble will accept that I have my rights, too.",

Michael Farrell, the former leader of the student radical group People's Democracy, said two key elements of Patten - a central policing board and an independent ombudsman - should be introduced in the republic. Farrell, an executive member of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, said the logic of the Irish government's demand that Patten be implemented in the North meant the principles of the report should extend to policing south of the border. The Irish Labour Party has made similar demands that the Garda be more democratically accountable, along the lines of Chris Patten's recommendations. Reiterating his call for a policing board, which he first made at a human rights conference attended by gardai and RUC officers in Dublin last month, Farrell said: 'The Garda Siochana is now unique in these islands in being a hierarchical national body answerable only to the Minister for Justice, and perhaps even answerable to him as far as operational matters are concerned. 'The system may have been designed to isolate the Garda from too much political contact and control, but it is not clear that it has always achieved that objective, while it has tended to cut the Garda off from civilian scrutiny and input. 'The establishment of a policing board, like what is proposed for the Northern police service, could [act] as a buffer between government and the Garda while [making] the Garda more responsive to public concerns and priorities.'

He was on a plane from Lagos interviewing the father of Damilola Taylor, the 10-year-old who was murdered in Peckham last week, when the distraught man said that he considered his son's murder racist. Cue front page splash on 'Boy's West Indian tormentors'.</p> <p>All of a sudden we are left talking about whether there is a rift between Britain's West Indian and African communities. And more importantly whether this was to blame for the killing of the little boy. Next thing you know, activists on either 'side' receive phone calls from journalists. Leading questions are put to them. 'All West Indians are trouble makers,' says the Nigerian one. 'Nigerians are just arrogant,' retorts the Jamaican. Divide and rule was always the colonial way.</p> <p>The fact is that if you want to find aggro between any two communities it is not hard to do so. It's even easier when a tragedy such as the one that took place in Peckham last Monday has occurred - tensions are fraught and people are looking for someone to blame.</p> <p>The idea that Damilola was killed by West Indians because he was African serves many purposes, the most obvious being that it offers up a perpetrator. But is the state of relations between the two communities really that bad? The truth is that there has always been prejudice of some sort. But in my experience the situation has become better, not worse, over the years.</p> <p>I remember my mum warning me not to think that I was a West Indian because all they knew was how to cause trouble.

      "bodyText": "It must have been music to the ears of the reporter. He was on a plane from Lagos interviewing the father of Damilola Taylor, the 10-year-old who was murdered in Peckham last week, when the distraught man said that he considered his son's murder racist. Cue front page splash on 'Boy's West Indian tormentors'. All of a sudden we are left talking about whether there is a rift between Britain's West Indian and African communities. And more importantly whether this was to blame for the killing of the little boy. Next thing you know, activists on either 'side' receive phone calls from journalists. Leading questions are put to them. 'All West Indians are trouble makers,' says the Nigerian one. 'Nigerians are just arrogant,' retorts the Jamaican. Divide and rule was always the colonial way. The fact is that if you want to find aggro between any two communities it is not hard to do so. It's even easier when a tragedy such as the one that took place in Peckham last Monday has occurred - tensions are fraught and people are looking for someone to blame. The idea that Damilola was killed by West Indians because he was African serves many purposes, the most obvious being that it offers up a perpetrator. But is the state of relations between the two communities really that bad? The truth is that there has always been prejudice of some sort. But in my experience the situation has become better, not worse, over the years. I remember my mum warning me not to think that I was a West Indian because all they knew was how to cause trouble. And that was typical of the way people thought back then - we're talking early to mid-Seventies here. But I also remember the fact that mum didn't have any friends from a Caribbean background.

Arellano had cautioned his fellow plotters earlier in 1973 against telling Pinochet of their seditious plans because he was certain that Pinochet, as the commander-in-chief of the army newly appointed by the President, would have denounced him as a traitor.

But in the past few days a slimline Milosevic in a rumpled suit, guarded by slightly less intimidating minders than usual, emerged to dominate the Congress of the Socialist Party of Serbia, SPS, just like the old days. And up popped his wife, Mirjana Markovic, in the National Assembly, just like the old days.</p> <p>Belgrade's old monsters are supposed to be dead, stakes in their hearts. But here they are strutting around as if in an endless replay of a Hammer Horror vampire movie. The consensus is that Milosevic is, this time, really finished.</p> <p>But, as one Serb commentator put it in a classic Balkan sinisterism as he gazed through the swirling wintry mist over the Danube: 'Slobo's crocodiles are still in the river.'</p> <p>The strange case of the non-investigation into the assassination of editor Slavko Curuvija has added to the ooze of unease about the not-quite revolution.</p> <p>Curuvija was no Serbian Harry Evans, more a Kelvin MacKenzie, his pen dipped in vitriol. He had been a secret policeman, close to the Milosevic family and to Mirjana. But then he split with the regime and his two papers, The European and the Daily Telegraph , began to lambast Milosevic and co.</p> <p>On 19 October 1998, Curuvija wrote a front-page editorial for The European that turned out to be his own death sentence: 'Nowhere in today's Europe are criminals and the state wedded in such a harmonious matrimony as here in Serbia. Organised gangs control the circulation of key goods and services. Paramilitary formations still operate. Street violence and murders are a daily occurrence. A psychosis of a permanent state of emergency has been imposed on society, added to the fear generated by omnipotent police and your henchmen, who boast that they can order executions of the people they dislike.'</p> <p>Curuvija was fined \u00a360,000 - a huge sum in bankrupt Serbia. He kept on printing. A more effective form of censorship was called for.</p> <p>THE TWO GUNMEN, their faces hidden behind ski masks, emerged on Orthodox Easter Day, 11 April 1999. The editor and his wife were outside their home, a grey five- storey apartment block at 35 Lole Ribara Street, Belgrade. The men pistol-whipped Curuvija's wife, Branka Prpa, and then slotted 11 bullets into the editor, first into the back of his head, then into his prone form.</p> <p>No one claimed responsibility and his death merited barely a mention in one of the regime's rags, Novosti . The editor had been killed by 'unknown persons ... Interior Ministry secretariat are intensively looking for the criminals who carried out the attack'. No one from the government turned up at the funeral.</p> <p>Thus far, no arrests have been made. But it turns out that the Interior Ministry secretariat might have intensively looked at General Rade Markovic, head of the SDB, the Serbian Security Police. It emerged after the not-quite revolution that Curuvija was being tailed. An SDB docu ment leaked to the Belgrade press describes the last hours of the editor's life: 'At 16:27 the subject emerges from the restaurant with his wife. At 16:58 we stop any further surveillance as agreed with the head of the department. The subject did not display obvious signs of caution.'</p> <p>At 17:15 the editor was shot dead.</p> <p>The leaker of the SDB document added that 'the murder was perpetrated by three persons who then used a white Volkswagen Golf Mk3 as an escape vehicle'.

      "bodyText": "Turning a blind eye to the murder of a newspaper editor - as a general rule - is not quite the done thing in polite society, but the smoothing over of one such murder tells you much about Yugoslavia's not-quite revolution. Two months on from Slobodan Milosevic's enforced exit from power, the instant celebrations begin to appear a little na\u00efve, the residue of years of dictatorship and war more difficult to sponge away. The shiny new president, Vojislav Kostunica, is in; Milosevic is, theoretically, out. But in the past few days a slimline Milosevic in a rumpled suit, guarded by slightly less intimidating minders than usual, emerged to dominate the Congress of the Socialist Party of Serbia, SPS, just like the old days. And up popped his wife, Mirjana Markovic, in the National Assembly, just like the old days. Belgrade's old monsters are supposed to be dead, stakes in their hearts. But here they are strutting around as if in an endless replay of a Hammer Horror vampire movie. The consensus is that Milosevic is, this time, really finished. But, as one Serb commentator put it in a classic Balkan sinisterism as he gazed through the swirling wintry mist over the Danube: 'Slobo's crocodiles are still in the river.' The strange case of the non-investigation into the assassination of editor Slavko Curuvija has added to the ooze of unease about the not-quite revolution. Curuvija was no Serbian Harry Evans, more a Kelvin MacKenzie, his pen dipped in vitriol. He had been a secret policeman, close to the Milosevic family and to Mirjana. But then he split with the regime and his two papers, The European and the Daily Telegraph , began to lambast Milosevic and co. On 19 October 1998, Curuvija wrote a front-page editorial for The European that turned out to be his own death sentence: 'Nowhere in today's Europe are criminals and the state wedded in such a harmonious matrimony as here in Serbia. Organised gangs control the circulation of key goods and services. Paramilitary formations still operate. Street violence and murders are a daily occurrence. A psychosis of a permanent state of emergency has been imposed on society, added to the fear generated by omnipotent police and your henchmen, who boast that they can order executions of the people they dislike.' Curuvija was fined \u00a360,000 - a huge sum in bankrupt Serbia. He kept on printing. A more effective form of censorship was called for. THE TWO GUNMEN, their faces hidden behind ski masks, emerged on Orthodox Easter Day, 11 April 1999. The editor and his wife were outside their home, a grey five- storey apartment block at 35 Lole Ribara Street, Belgrade. The men pistol-whipped Curuvija's wife, Branka Prpa, and then slotted 11 bullets into the editor, first into the back of his head, then into his prone form. No one claimed responsibility and his death merited barely a mention in one of the regime's rags, Novosti . The editor had been killed by 'unknown persons ... Interior Ministry secretariat are intensively looking for the criminals who carried out the attack'. No one from the government turned up at the funeral. Thus far, no arrests have been made. But it turns out that the Interior Ministry secretariat might have intensively looked at General Rade Markovic, head of the SDB, the Serbian Security Police. It emerged after the not-quite revolution that Curuvija was being tailed. An SDB docu ment leaked to the Belgrade press describes the last hours of the editor's life: 'At 16:27 the subject emerges from the restaurant with his wife. At 16:58 we stop any further surveillance as agreed with the head of the department. The subject did not display obvious signs of caution.' At 17:15 the editor was shot dead. The leaker of the SDB document added that 'the murder was perpetrated by three persons who then used a white Volkswagen Golf Mk3 as an escape vehicle'. Not two but three hitmen was a fresh detail. His widow said: 'There were some things in the report that only I knew, and which I had never said to anybody else either privately or publicly.' The newspaper Blic ran an article on the surveillance operation, with a photograph showing the headquarters of the Ninth Directorate of the SDB, but no address. The article was written anonymously and there was no picture byline - suggesting journalists even now are uneasy about being identified with some stories. The Ninth Directorate is housed at Mije Kovacevica Street, at the back of a fire station near New Cemetery. The Observer drove past to take a look. It is a dreary, anonymous office block, the home of secret policemen everywhere. On the face of it, the surveillance team was pulled back to allow the hitmen to do their work - and the leaked report is damning evidence of collusion between the high command of the Ninth Directorate and the killers. The head of the Belgrade SDB is Milan Radonjic, his boss General Markovic. Far from being arrested after the 5 October 'revolution', Markovic is still the head of the SDB. Markovic is also held by some to be responsible for the failed assassination attempt on opposition leader Vuk Draskovic - a mysterious car crash in which at least one bodyguard was killed. While Markovic was head of Milosevic's all-powerful secret police, many people who had fallen out with the regime, such as the war criminal Arkan, were murdered. Equally mysterious is the strange disappearance of former Belgrade party boss Ivan Stambolic, who once groomed Milosevic as his prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Many Belgraders believe Stambolic was 'disappeared' by the SDB. The secret police were held to be responsible for the ugly harassment of opposition politicians and journalists, who were fined a total of \u00a31 million in 1999. Some were beaten up, some cars exploded. So imagine the unease in Belgrade when opposition leaders such as Draskovic and Zoran Djindic learned that last month Kostunica travelled to Brussels and approached Chris Patten, the European Union's External Relations Commissioner, and asked him to strike out Markovic's name from the EU's list of banned Serbs. An EU official said: 'Kostunica's people produced a long list of names they wanted removed.' Djindjic said: 'This proposal was made by someone with sympathies towards the Milosevic regime. I was most surprised by the removal of Rade Markovic from the list.' One Western diplomatic source said: 'This is simple. It's payback time. The top secret policeman, Markovic, and the top general, Nebojsa Pavkovic, sat on their hands on 5 October. We expected them to support the regime to the hilt, and they didn't. Kostunica knows they are much more trouble on the outside than on the inside, helping him as much as they can.' Timing is also part of Kostunica's equation. Although President of Yugoslavia, he and the democratic opposition, DOS - 18 splinter parties glued together only by their hatred of Milosevic - have no formal sway in the Serbian government, still dominated by Milosevic's Socialist Party of Serbia, until elections on 23 December . Veselin Simonivic, editor in chief of Blic, said: 'Until then, nothing is clear. There are no independent judges or police investigators. All the Serbian ministries are in the hands of the old regime. We are living in a strange limbo, waiting for 23 December.' Waiting too is Serbia's Deputy Minister of Information, Mirodrag Popovic. Once a smooth-talking loyalist and a member of JUL, the Yugoslav Left party run by Milosevic's wife as a personal fiefdom, Popovic was busy last week re-inventing history in the American-accented English he learned at UCLA in the Seventies, in between visits to Disneyland. As the strains of 'Blue Velvet' played out over the Hotel Majestic's caf\u00e9, he bemoaned the fact that he was still on the EU list of banned people. 'I'm in the top 20, ahead of Milosevic. But all I did was help journalists, people like my good friend Brent Sadler of CNN.' The new HQ of Milosevic's Socialist Party at 121 Boulevard Avnoja in New Belgrade is hard to find. There is no sign, no photograph of the old boss. A man emerged from the building. The Observer : 'Is this 121 Boulevard Avnoja?' Man: 'I don't know. I'm not from Belgrade.' Observer : 'What is this building?' Man: (Long pause as he looks up and down street): 'It's the_ it's the_ the HQ of the SPS.' The business of forgetting is all the rage in Belgrade these days, but for some - like the editor's widow - it is not so easy to bury the past.",

The evidence provided by Khalid al-Janabi, formerly a captain in the Mukhabarat, confirms in horrifying detail reports earlier this year describing Saddam's prison 'cleansing' massacres in 1998.</p> <p>He also reveals fresh details of the operation of the Mukhabarat's secret mechanisms of fear and repression told uniquely from the perspective of one of Saddam's killers, not one of his victims.</p> <p>Janabi, who escaped to Jordan last year, served as an officer in the Mukhabarat from 1979 to 1999. He is a member of the extensive Janabi clan, many of whose members have been loyal servants of Saddam and his family. He fled Iraq, however, after the execution of his brother, General Kamil Sachit al-Janabi, who had been a senior military governor in Kuwait during Iraq's occupation.</p> <p>Khalid al-Janabi's testimony was given in long interviews with Radio Free Iraq. The details have, however, been corroborated by diplomatic sources. Janabi's most devastating testimony relates to the events that occurred after 15 March 1998, the day that Saddam's personal office issued a directive to 'clean' Iraq's prisons.</p> <p>The task, his account makes clear, was regarded as a bureaucratic as well as a physical problem to be overcome. To this end, Saddam ordered the creation of 'supervisory committees' to oversee the killings at each prison. On 20 March, says Janabi, he and three officers from other state bodies were appointed as the 'supervisory committee' to select and oversee the liquidation of 2,000 prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison.</p> <p>'On 15 March 1998, we were advised of a Revolution Command Council decision to clean up the prisons. The Presidency Office and the Special Security Forces ordered the security services to set up a committee comprising representatives from Military Intelligence, Public Security, Special Security, and the Mukhabarat to act as a supervisory body at Abu Ghraib prison.'</p> <p>On 26 April - two days before Saddam's birthday - the President's son Qusay visited the prison as Special Security Forces men surrounded the compound and provided protection. Qusay, accompanied by the prison governor, Hassan al-Amiri, entered a section of the jail containing five barracks around a large hall and inquired about the inmates.</p> <p>According to Janabi, most had been sentenced to long jail terms,while a few were expecting to be released. 'Most of them were from the south, accused of joining parties and taking part in (anti-government) activities,' said Janabi. 'There was, of course, no foundation for such accusations, but accusing people of such activity is standard procedure. Most seemed quite helpless to me and didn't appear likely to threaten Saddam Hussein. They had just been dragged in from the Marshes and thrown into Abu Ghraib.'</p> <p>Qusay gave the governor orders to execute the inmates in those barracks the next day. Although the governor protested it was impossible to execute that many people in a single day, Qusay insisted on the killings. According to Janabi, the killing began in earnest at 6am the following day. Firing squads, assembled under the supervision of the governor and Janabi's 'committee', brought the prisoners in groups to be shot in several indoor chambers. Other inmates were hanged in a special 'hanging hall'. Janabi says the usual method for execution by firing squad is two bullets in the chest followed by a shot to the head. However, the pressure of killing so many meant that they were only shot in the head.</p> <p>'Abu Ghraib prison has five gallows,' explains Janabi. 'Some were hanged. Others were shot. Each victim was shot once in the head. Even worse, the bodies of many of those who were executed were not handed over to their families. There is a cemetery nearby, the Al-Karkh Cemetery. If you go there you will see a sign pointing to a \"special path\". Many of the victims were buried there with only numerical identification.'</p> <p>By 9pm, 2,000 inmates had been killed. Janabi defends his role in the murders as being under institutional duress.'The executions themselves were carried out by prison specialists, but what was the governor to do? How could he argue when the place was surrounded by Qusay's armed men? One has to accept such a situation. We were, after all, under orders...'</p> <p>Janabi also provided a chilling view of the sexual blackmail used by Saddam's secret services.</p> <p>'One of our directorates,' Janabi said, 'known as the Directorate of Technical Operations, specialises in moral matters.' What Janabi describes next is the systematic corruption and threatening of whole families, often by women operating for the Mukhabarat.</p> <p>He continues: 'Take a military commander. Let's assume that this officer has a daughter and that she is talking on the phone... The Mukhabarat has been monitoring this senior official's phone. Let's now assume that she is talking to a lover. The recording is in their hands and they exploit it.</p> <p>'They choose a day when the officer is on duty. They go to the house and talk to his wife. They tell her... they have been monitoring her husband's affairs. They tell her that they have a cassette recording of her daughter talking to a young man about love and such matters, \"and we intend to have your husband listen to it\".</p> <p>'They then say to the mother: \"We need something from you, and we want you to carry it out whether you like it or not. We will give you a copy of the cassette and keep the original, but we won't tell your husband about it. If you choose to resist us, we have special houses everywhere... your daughter can be kidnapped, sexually assaulted and filmed\".</p> <p>'Such a film is not shown immediately. The tape is then kept at the Mukhabarat until the day when Saddam Hussein suspects the officer of working against him. He summons the officer and says to him: \"See how we have preserved your honour by keeping this under wraps, while you choose to work against us\".'</p> <p>About 90 women officers are involved in blackmail operations under the supervision of Qusay.</p> <p>Asked why he had decided to speak out now, Janabi says: 'We are the ones who protect Saddam, and it is we who have brought Saddam to where he is now. We cannot remain silent while Saddam dishonours us, in exchange for our positions and our interests.'</p> <p>Foreign Office Minister Peter Hain said: 'Nobody should forget Saddam's evil bestiality. Those who want the United Nations to abandon sanctions and walk away are inviting him to terrorise Iraqi Kurds in the north, his neighbours and the region with horrendous violence.'</p>",

The Presidency Office and the Special Security Forces ordered the security services to set up a committee comprising representatives from Military Intelligence, Public Security, Special Security, and the Mukhabarat to act as a supervisory body at Abu Ghraib prison.' On 26 April - two days before Saddam's birthday - the President's son Qusay visited the prison as Special Security Forces men surrounded the compound and provided protection. Qusay, accompanied by the prison governor, Hassan al-Amiri, entered a section of the jail containing five barracks around a large hall and inquired about the inmates. According to Janabi, most had been sentenced to long jail terms,while a few were expecting to be released. 'Most of them were from the south, accused of joining parties and taking part in (anti-government) activities,' said Janabi. 'There was, of course, no foundation for such accusations, but accusing people of such activity is standard procedure. Most seemed quite helpless to me and didn't appear likely to threaten Saddam Hussein. They had just been dragged in from the Marshes and thrown into Abu Ghraib.' Qusay gave the governor orders to execute the inmates in those barracks the next day. Although the governor protested it was impossible to execute that many people in a single day, Qusay insisted on the killings. According to Janabi, the killing began in earnest at 6am the following day. Firing squads, assembled under the supervision of the governor and Janabi's 'committee', brought the prisoners in groups to be shot in several indoor chambers. Other inmates were hanged in a special 'hanging hall'. Janabi says the usual method for execution by firing squad is two bullets in the chest followed by a shot to the head. However, the pressure of killing so many meant that they were only shot in the head. 'Abu Ghraib prison has five gallows,' explains Janabi. 'Some were hanged. Others were shot. Each victim was shot once in the head. Even worse, the bodies of many of those who were executed were not handed over to their families. There is a cemetery nearby, the Al-Karkh Cemetery. If you go there you will see a sign pointing to a \"special path\". Many of the victims were buried there with only numerical identification.' By 9pm, 2,000 inmates had been killed. Janabi defends his role in the murders as being under institutional duress.'The executions themselves were carried out by prison specialists, but what was the governor to do? How could he argue when the place was surrounded by Qusay's armed men? One has to accept such a situation. We were, after all, under orders...' Janabi also provided a chilling view of the sexual blackmail used by Saddam's secret services. 'One of our directorates,' Janabi said, 'known as the Directorate of Technical Operations, specialises in moral matters.' What Janabi describes next is the systematic corruption and threatening of whole families, often by women operating for the Mukhabarat. He continues: 'Take a military commander. Let's assume that this officer has a daughter and that she is talking on the phone... The Mukhabarat has been monitoring this senior official's phone. Let's now assume that she is talking to a lover. The recording is in their hands and they exploit it. 'They choose a day when the officer is on duty. They go to the house and talk to his wife. They tell her... they have been monitoring her husband's affairs. They tell her that they have a cassette recording of her daughter talking to a young man about love and such matters, \"and we intend to have your husband listen to it\". 'They then say to the mother: \"We need something from you, and we want you to carry it out whether you like it or not. We will give you a copy of the cassette and keep the original, but we won't tell your husband about it. If you choose to resist us, we have special houses everywhere... your daughter can be kidnapped, sexually assaulted and filmed\". 'Such a film is not shown immediately. The tape is then kept at the Mukhabarat until the day when Saddam Hussein suspects the officer of working against him. He summons the officer and says to him: \"See how we have preserved your honour by keeping this under wraps, while you choose to work against us\".' About 90 women officers are involved in blackmail operations under the supervision of Qusay. Asked why he had decided to speak out now, Janabi says: 'We are the ones who protect Saddam, and it is we who have brought Saddam to where he is now. We cannot remain silent while Saddam dishonours us, in exchange for our positions and our interests.' Foreign Office Minister Peter Hain said: 'Nobody should forget Saddam's evil bestiality. Those who want the United Nations to abandon sanctions and walk away are inviting him to terrorise Iraqi Kurds in the north, his neighbours and the region with horrendous violence.'",

When we first met, it was completely the opposite. </p> <p> While we were at university, the four of us also started the English Teddy Bear Company, so not only was our emotional life mixed up, our business was, too. We were very close for four years, but after Cambridge we drifted apart. Henrietta left us and got married. My fianc\u00e9e and my boyfriend ended up getting married to each other. So that left me. The breakup was very difficult and I felt betrayed. </p> <p> Then I bumped into Henrietta in a sale on the King's Road and we started to rebuild our relationship. At the time, I was extricating myself from the teddy bear company, which was extremely painful.

She had a husband and a child, but she was in love with another woman and she could no longer deny her sexuality. As we talked about our sexuality, one of the issues which came up was that we didn't feel represented by mainstream gay culture. I felt the answer was the internet, and four years ago secured some domain names. Last November, we finally put a business plan together and got funding. </p> <p> I am totally involved with Henrietta. We literally had fallen out as much as two people could. It was absolutely miserable and horrible. It was a war of wills and silence, it was a form of divorce. Having gone through all of that, it makes you realise, if you can go through that and still have a relationship, then that's something special. </p> <p><strong> Henrietta Morrison:</strong> A lot of people say never start a business with a friend. But we've already done it and know how difficult it can be. When we set up the teddy bear shops at university, it was a nightmare. We were trying to run a business as well as being students. We'd be studying during the day and I'd be making bears and clothes in the night. </p> <p>Dominic didn't sew and I'm not the world's best, and I was completely exhausted. I was almost thrown out of university. The accumulation of the stress of it all, and issues of sexuality to deal with, was too much. I came from a traditional background and was always the sort of person always doing the right thing. I walked out and that was it. </p> <p> Dominic and I didn't speak for years. We'd see each other from a distance and avoid eye contact. Then we bumped into each other one day in Chelsea and couldn't stay angry with each other any longer. Soon afterwards, I came out and I very much needed his support. I had been married for three years and had a child, but realised I really must be a lesbian. It was a crisis. Not only was there my husband to consider, there was all his family and all mine. I felt I'd let the world down. Through Dominic, I got to understand that this wasn't a bizarre, dreadful thing to happen and there were ways of coping so everyone could be happy. </p> <p> We are very open about our family - I live with my girlfriend, who is a wine expert, and my daughter spends part of the week with us and part with my husband, who lives nearby. We haven't faced any hostility. </p> <p> For Dominic, falling out with the others and leaving the teddy bear company let him branch out, working in property development and at St James's Palace as Prince Charles's architectural assistant. </p> <p> We can now be extremely creative together, sparking ideas off each other all the time.

      "body": "<p>During the 1997 marching season, the UVF attempted to calm communal passions. The Orange Order had threatened Province-wide demonstrations on 12 July, including the re-routing of its largest Belfast march through the nationalist Lower Ormeau area, in protest at the ban on the local Ballynafeigh Lodge marching down the Ormeau Road. </p> <p>A massive conflagration on Ormeau Bridge, with the risk of widespread violence in the city, was prevented only after the Order announced it would unilaterally re-route its parades away from contentious areas such as the Lower Ormeau and Bellaghy. </p> <p>When the Ballynafeigh Orange Lodge met on the night of 11 July - an evening charged with sectarianism, drunkenness and menace - they faced two sets of demonstrators. A smaller group of DUP supporters and extreme anti-ceasefire loyalists, who wanted no compromise on parade, harangued the Orangemen, urging them not to 'sell out'. But they were heavily outnumbered by groups of burly middle-aged men who had arrived at the Orange Hall in black taxis from the Shankill area. This was the UVF's Shankill battalion, which had been sent to protect those Orangemen prepared to compromise on the Twelfth marches in the face of hard-line protesters. </p> <p>The UDA's South Belfast brigadier had also informed the Ballynafeigh Orange Lodge earlier that day that his members would not be coming on to the streets to riot and protest if the local Orangemen rejected the advice of the Grand Lodge and tried to break the ban on marching along the Lower Ormeau Road. </p> <p>The Orange Order prides itself on being law-abiding. It refuses to talk to 'terrorist spokesmen' who represent nationalist residents' groups, such as former republican prisoner Brendan McKenna in Portadown. But the organisation appeared to have had no problem with the UVF deploying some muscle to enforce the Grand Lodge's decision to compromise on the parades issue. The hypocrisy was breathtaking. </p> <p>A relatively peaceful Twelfth of July was followed by a second IRA ceasefire at the end of the month and the re-entry of Sinn Fein into all-party talks in the autumn. While Ian Paisley's DUP and Bob McCartney's UKUP walked out of the Stormont negotiations, David Trimble and the Ulster Unionist Party decided to stay in. On the day Trimble led his party back into historic discussions with the IRA's political wing, he was accompanied by leading figures in both the PUP and the UDP. The presence of David Ervine, Billy Hutchinson, Gary McMichael and John White alongside Trimble, Ken Maginnis, Reg Empey and other stalwarts of Ulster unionism created the impression of a united unionist front at Stormont. </p> <p>But the sight of convicted loyalist terrorists standing shoulder-to-shoulder with UUP MPs sickened many middle-class unionists who regarded the UVF and UDA with almost as much contempt as they did the IRA and the INLA. </p> <p>One of those who would describe himself as a respectable middle-class unionist was David Wright, the father of King Rat Billy. David Wright was aware of his son's involvement in loyalist terrorism, but took no interest in his extremist politics. The 67-year-old grandfather was a unionist with a small 'u', proud to be British but not zealous enough to support his son's brand of violent loyalism. However, his faith in British justice was about to be shaken shortly after Christmas 1997. </p> <p>At around a quarter past nine on the morning of Saturday 27 December, Billy Wright was sitting in a van in the forecourt outside H-block 6 of the Maze prison. He was waiting for a visit from his girlfriend when two INLA prisoners who had escaped from their wing of H-6 via the roof overlooking the forecourt approached the van. They pulled open the side door and fired several shots into Wright's body at point-blank range. Fifty-four minutes later, King Rat was dead. The gunmen, Christopher 'Crip' McWilliams and John Kenaway, returned to their wing and asked for a priest so they could surrender to the authorities. </p> <p>On one level, the INLA attack was a daring bid and earned the organisation, for so long riven by internal feuds, a new credibility among young working-class nationalists. The killing resurrected McWilliams's name from the mud. He had been in prison serving a life sentence for the murder of Colm Mahon, a Catholic bar manager who was gunned down simply because he ordered Crip and his friends out of Frames nightclub in Belfast six years earlier. The weapon used to shoot Wright had been smuggled into the jail under the noses of prison officers in a child's nappy. The INLA had not only killed a loyalist icon; they had also breached security at what was meant to be one of the most impregnable prisons in the Western world. </p> <p>But David Wright and later a number of civil liberties groups were convinced the British state had a hand in setting King Rat up for assassination, thus removing a key figure in the anti- ceasefire loyalist movement. David Wright and the pressure group British-Irish Rights Watch found that there were several discrepancies in the official version of the events leading up to Billy Wright's murder. These included: </p> <p>\u0095 <strong> Visit sheets.</strong> According to David Wright and the team investigating the killing, the sheets outlining who was due to visit relatives and loved ones on 27 December were sent down both wings of H-block 6 the night before. This meant INLA prisoners could see Billy Wright was due a visit the following morning, enabling them to plan his murder. </p> <p>David Wright was given the visit sheets a few days after his son was shot. He claimed that at the inquest in February 1999 there was confusion over a second visit sheet produced in court by the Northern Ireland Office, which regulates prisons in Northern Ireland. Wright said the NIO's visit sheet was radically different from the one handed to him by LVF prisoners after the murder. At the inquest, the NIO representative could not explain why the sheets were different. </p> <p>\u0095 <strong> Watchtower overlooking H-6:</strong> At the inquest it was admitted no one was inside the watchtower overlooking the courtyard where two minibuses were parked ready to take the LVF prisoner (and later the INLA inmates) to visits in another part of the Maze. The prison officer who was meant to be manning the watchtower, Raymond Hill, claimed he was called away from the watchtower via an intercom on two occasions, including that period when the INLA prisoners cut their way through a wire fence into the courtyard to shoot Wright in the van. The NIO initially said prison officer Hill was called away on only one occasion. </p> <p>Wright's father was granted a visit this year to inspect the area where his son was killed. David Wright had been told by NIO officials the watchtower was not in line of sight of the part of the fence McWilliams and his cohorts had cut through. However, photographs David Wright requested during his visit show the hole in the fence would have been in the line of sight of the prison officer - had he been there at the time. </p> <p>\u0095 <strong> Camera overlooking H-6.</strong> The security camera trained on the courtyard had not been working on 27 December and had not been repaired over the Christmas period, despite warnings from prison officers of serious trouble erupting between the LVF and INLA in H-block 6. </p> <p>In addition to these concerns, there were questions over the wisdom of placing such deadly enemies in the same H-block at a time when both organisations were not on ceasefire. Moreover, there had already been security breaches in connection with INLA prisoners in nearby Maghaberry Prison. </p> <p>McWilliams was among a number of INLA prisoners transferred from Maghaberry to the Maze after the attempted murder of a rival republican in the former prison the previous year. </p> <p>The INLA had smuggled a gun into Maghaberry which was given to McWilliams. Crip was told to assassinate Kevin McAlorum, a follower of the late INLA chief-of-staff Hugh Torney. McAlorum was blamed for killing Geno Gallagher, Torney's deadly rival in the INLA, during an internal feud in 1996. </p> <p>The fact the INLA had been behind one attempt to smuggle weapons into a jail with the intent of killing another prisoner did not seem to impact upon the NIO's security considerations when it moved the republican terror group's prisoners into the same H-block as Wright and the LVF. </p> <p>Despite the closure of the Billy Wright murder case, his father insists he will continue to campaign for an international inquiry into his death inside what was supposed to be a top-security prison. </p> <p>'There are far too many coincidences over the camera, the visit sheets, the absence of anybody in the watchtower in one morning to convince me this killing was a fluke,' David Wright has said. </p> <p>He has even asked nationalists to back his call for an international inquiry, despite his son's fearsome reputation for sectarian murder and intimidation. </p> <p>'There is no death penalty in this country and no one - and I mean no one - should be killed for their political views. Once you go into jail, whether you are a loyalist or a republican, the state must protect you from being killed or injured. The irony is that if Billy Wright had fallen and broken his leg in the prison gym, the authorities would have been held responsible. And yet they can let Billy be killed in strange circumstances inside a so-called top-security jail. British justice does not exist,' said a bitter David Wright. </p> <p>In death, Billy Wright became a cult hero, not only for young loyalists in Mid-Ulster, but also for those in the ranks of organisations such as the UDA back in Belfast. One of the status symbols for loyalists in Portadown was, and is, to have the outline of Wright's face tattooed on your body. </p> <p>A tattooist with links to the neo-nazi Combat 18 has created a cottage industry of Billy Wright body art. When the English fascist from Bolton comes to Northern Ireland during the marching season, men and women flock to his makeshift tattoo parlours in houses on loyalist estates in Portadown. They have Wright's face imprinted on to their arms, legs, back and even more intimate parts of their anatomy. </p> <p>Wright's killers have also turned King Rat's iconic status to their advantage. The INLA produced T-shirts celebrating the death of the LVF leader. One showed a rat caught inside a giant H, complete with the words from the Boomtown Rats' 1978 hit: 'It's a rat trap, Billy, and you've been caught.' </p> <p>The T-shirts sold like hot cakes in Catholic areas of Northern Ireland and among sections of the Celtic faithful in Glasgow in the weeks following Wright's death. </p> <p> 'UVF', by Henry McDonald and Jim Cusack, is published by Poolbeg at \u00a39.99.</p>",

One of those who would describe himself as a respectable middle-class unionist was David Wright, the father of King Rat Billy. David Wright was aware of his son's involvement in loyalist terrorism, but took no interest in his extremist politics. The 67-year-old grandfather was a unionist with a small 'u', proud to be British but not zealous enough to support his son's brand of violent loyalism. However, his faith in British justice was about to be shaken shortly after Christmas 1997. At around a quarter past nine on the morning of Saturday 27 December, Billy Wright was sitting in a van in the forecourt outside H-block 6 of the Maze prison. He was waiting for a visit from his girlfriend when two INLA prisoners who had escaped from their wing of H-6 via the roof overlooking the forecourt approached the van. They pulled open the side door and fired several shots into Wright's body at point-blank range. Fifty-four minutes later, King Rat was dead. The gunmen, Christopher 'Crip' McWilliams and John Kenaway, returned to their wing and asked for a priest so they could surrender to the authorities. On one level, the INLA attack was a daring bid and earned the organisation, for so long riven by internal feuds, a new credibility among young working-class nationalists. The killing resurrected McWilliams's name from the mud. He had been in prison serving a life sentence for the murder of Colm Mahon, a Catholic bar manager who was gunned down simply because he ordered Crip and his friends out of Frames nightclub in Belfast six years earlier. The weapon used to shoot Wright had been smuggled into the jail under the noses of prison officers in a child's nappy. The INLA had not only killed a loyalist icon; they had also breached security at what was meant to be one of the most impregnable prisons in the Western world. But David Wright and later a number of civil liberties groups were convinced the British state had a hand in setting King Rat up for assassination, thus removing a key figure in the anti- ceasefire loyalist movement. David Wright and the pressure group British-Irish Rights Watch found that there were several discrepancies in the official version of the events leading up to Billy Wright's murder. These included: \u0095 Visit sheets. According to David Wright and the team investigating the killing, the sheets outlining who was due to visit relatives and loved ones on 27 December were sent down both wings of H-block 6 the night before. This meant INLA prisoners could see Billy Wright was due a visit the following morning, enabling them to plan his murder. David Wright was given the visit sheets a few days after his son was shot. He claimed that at the inquest in February 1999 there was confusion over a second visit sheet produced in court by the Northern Ireland Office, which regulates prisons in Northern Ireland. Wright said the NIO's visit sheet was radically different from the one handed to him by LVF prisoners after the murder. At the inquest, the NIO representative could not explain why the sheets were different. \u0095 Watchtower overlooking H-6: At the inquest it was admitted no one was inside the watchtower overlooking the courtyard where two minibuses were parked ready to take the LVF prisoner (and later the INLA inmates) to visits in another part of the Maze. The prison officer who was meant to be manning the watchtower, Raymond Hill, claimed he was called away from the watchtower via an intercom on two occasions, including that period when the INLA prisoners cut their way through a wire fence into the courtyard to shoot Wright in the van. The NIO initially said prison officer Hill was called away on only one occasion. Wright's father was granted a visit this year to inspect the area where his son was killed. David Wright had been told by NIO officials the watchtower was not in line of sight of the part of the fence McWilliams and his cohorts had cut through. However, photographs David Wright requested during his visit show the hole in the fence would have been in the line of sight of the prison officer - had he been there at the time. \u0095 Camera overlooking H-6. The security camera trained on the courtyard had not been working on 27 December and had not been repaired over the Christmas period, despite warnings from prison officers of serious trouble erupting between the LVF and INLA in H-block 6. In addition to these concerns, there were questions over the wisdom of placing such deadly enemies in the same H-block at a time when both organisations were not on ceasefire. Moreover, there had already been security breaches in connection with INLA prisoners in nearby Maghaberry Prison. McWilliams was among a number of INLA prisoners transferred from Maghaberry to the Maze after the attempted murder of a rival republican in the former prison the previous year. The INLA had smuggled a gun into Maghaberry which was given to McWilliams. Crip was told to assassinate Kevin McAlorum, a follower of the late INLA chief-of-staff Hugh Torney. McAlorum was blamed for killing Geno Gallagher, Torney's deadly rival in the INLA, during an internal feud in 1996. The fact the INLA had been behind one attempt to smuggle weapons into a jail with the intent of killing another prisoner did not seem to impact upon the NIO's security considerations when it moved the republican terror group's prisoners into the same H-block as Wright and the LVF. Despite the closure of the Billy Wright murder case, his father insists he will continue to campaign for an international inquiry into his death inside what was supposed to be a top-security prison. 'There are far too many coincidences over the camera, the visit sheets, the absence of anybody in the watchtower in one morning to convince me this killing was a fluke,' David Wright has said. He has even asked nationalists to back his call for an international inquiry, despite his son's fearsome reputation for sectarian murder and intimidation. 'There is no death penalty in this country and no one - and I mean no one - should be killed for their political views. Once you go into jail, whether you are a loyalist or a republican, the state must protect you from being killed or injured. The irony is that if Billy Wright had fallen and broken his leg in the prison gym, the authorities would have been held responsible. And yet they can let Billy be killed in strange circumstances inside a so-called top-security jail. British justice does not exist,' said a bitter David Wright. In death, Billy Wright became a cult hero, not only for young loyalists in Mid-Ulster, but also for those in the ranks of organisations such as the UDA back in Belfast. One of the status symbols for loyalists in Portadown was, and is, to have the outline of Wright's face tattooed on your body. A tattooist with links to the neo-nazi Combat 18 has created a cottage industry of Billy Wright body art. When the English fascist from Bolton comes to Northern Ireland during the marching season, men and women flock to his makeshift tattoo parlours in houses on loyalist estates in Portadown. They have Wright's face imprinted on to their arms, legs, back and even more intimate parts of their anatomy. Wright's killers have also turned King Rat's iconic status to their advantage. The INLA produced T-shirts celebrating the death of the LVF leader. One showed a rat caught inside a giant H, complete with the words from the Boomtown Rats' 1978 hit: 'It's a rat trap, Billy, and you've been caught.' The T-shirts sold like hot cakes in Catholic areas of Northern Ireland and among sections of the Celtic faithful in Glasgow in the weeks following Wright's death.

But over the years it has expanded into Austrian linzer cake, German stollen, a densely fruit- and-nut-laden Italian panforte (the 420g chocolate-coated version is \u00a37.95, the glac\u00e9 fruit-topped one \u00a38.45), and its very own fruitcake extravagantly topped with glac\u00e9 fruits, pecans and brazil nuts: \u00a322.95 for a family-sized 1.4kg square. For smaller appetites, glac\u00e9 Seville orange slices are half dipped into first white then dark chocolate (\u00a34.95 for 100g). Add \u00a36 for UK mainland delivery, and note that orders close soon.</p> <p>We are advised to eat five portions of fruit per day as part of a healthy diet, although whether five pineapples or just five raisins is open to debate. One option that may appeal is dried, chocolate-covered figs. Those at <a href=\"http://www.marchents.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Marchents</a> (1 Apollo Rise, Southwood, Farnborough, Hampshire, 0870 606 1623) hail from near Lecce in southern Italy and are stuffed with an almond and spiked with lemon zest. Two or three days' supply (250g) cost \u00a310.50. The catalogue includes scores of other tempting items, all covered by the \u00a33.95 delivery charge.</p> <p>At <a href=\"http://www.carluccio.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Carluccio's</a> (28a Neal Street, London WC2, 020 7240 1487), the figs are stuffed with candied orange peel (thus doubling their nutritional value) before their appointment with a bitter-chocolate coating (\u00a315 for a 260g box). Other indulgences range from Scatola di Cioccolatini (a mix of nuts, candied and dried fruits in chocolate, \u00a34.95 for 80g), via a box of candied fruits (\u00a319.95 for 650g) to walnuts set on a layer of marzipan and coffee cream and dipped in chocolate (\u00a36.25 for 170g). Their traditional 1kg panettone at \u00a312.95 (a far-too-fussy-to-make-at-home yeast cake flavoured with candied orange, sultanas and almonds) is joined this year by a 5kg monster at \u00a375, packed in a sort of Ascot hat box.</p> <p>Southern Italians may have developed their collective sweet tooth from early Arab influences, but have since refined it in numerous ways. <a href=\"http://www.valvonacrolla.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">Valvona &amp; Crolla</a> (19 Elm Row, Edinburgh, 0131 556 6066) has located a supply of traditional fruttini di marzapone (marzipan shaped into fruits and coloured) in an obscure town near Caltanset in Sicily, which it sells loose at \u00a330 per kg. Another seasonal highlight is pepite di mandorla, soft amaretti-like biscuits variously flavoured with pistachio, coffee and almond, which are sold loose or pre-bagged at \u00a315 per kg. Then there are prunes stuffed with a soft prune paste (95p each), and a whole range of French glac\u00e9 fruits from pears, figs and clementines to pineapple and kumquats - while candied fruits are merely steeped in sugar, glac\u00e9 fruits go through the process over and over until they are five or six times sweeter, which helps to explain their price tag (\u00a332.50 per kg), although glac\u00e9 citrus peel for throwing into a cake can be had for \u00a38.50 per kg. Valvona &amp; Crolla's carefully researched panettone (\u00a312.99) comes from an artisan family bakery near Milan that has been turning them out for a century. Standard next-day delivery is \u00a38 (free over \u00a3100).</p> <p>\u0095 Jim Ainsworth is editor of The Good Food Guide.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Many small and richly concentrated Christmas delicacies come to us from Europe. Bettys and Taylors of Harrogate (Pagoda House, Plumpton Park, Harrogate, 0845 345 3636) was founded by a Swiss gentleman, which may explain the handmade chocolates (\u00a39.95 for a 160g box), the brown and white chocolate bears (\u00a311.75 each), and a moist, chewy star-shaped cross between a cake and a biscuit called biber (\u00a32.50). But over the years it has expanded into Austrian linzer cake, German stollen, a densely fruit- and-nut-laden Italian panforte (the 420g chocolate-coated version is \u00a37.95, the glac\u00e9 fruit-topped one \u00a38.45), and its very own fruitcake extravagantly topped with glac\u00e9 fruits, pecans and brazil nuts: \u00a322.95 for a family-sized 1.4kg square. For smaller appetites, glac\u00e9 Seville orange slices are half dipped into first white then dark chocolate (\u00a34.95 for 100g). Add \u00a36 for UK mainland delivery, and note that orders close soon. We are advised to eat five portions of fruit per day as part of a healthy diet, although whether five pineapples or just five raisins is open to debate. One option that may appeal is dried, chocolate-covered figs. Those at Marchents (1 Apollo Rise, Southwood, Farnborough, Hampshire, 0870 606 1623) hail from near Lecce in southern Italy and are stuffed with an almond and spiked with lemon zest. Two or three days' supply (250g) cost \u00a310.50. The catalogue includes scores of other tempting items, all covered by the \u00a33.95 delivery charge. At Carluccio's (28a Neal Street, London WC2, 020 7240 1487), the figs are stuffed with candied orange peel (thus doubling their nutritional value) before their appointment with a bitter-chocolate coating (\u00a315 for a 260g box). Other indulgences range from Scatola di Cioccolatini (a mix of nuts, candied and dried fruits in chocolate, \u00a34.95 for 80g), via a box of candied fruits (\u00a319.95 for 650g) to walnuts set on a layer of marzipan and coffee cream and dipped in chocolate (\u00a36.25 for 170g). Their traditional 1kg panettone at \u00a312.95 (a far-too-fussy-to-make-at-home yeast cake flavoured with candied orange, sultanas and almonds) is joined this year by a 5kg monster at \u00a375, packed in a sort of Ascot hat box. Southern Italians may have developed their collective sweet tooth from early Arab influences, but have since refined it in numerous ways. Valvona &amp; Crolla (19 Elm Row, Edinburgh, 0131 556 6066) has located a supply of traditional fruttini di marzapone (marzipan shaped into fruits and coloured) in an obscure town near Caltanset in Sicily, which it sells loose at \u00a330 per kg. Another seasonal highlight is pepite di mandorla, soft amaretti-like biscuits variously flavoured with pistachio, coffee and almond, which are sold loose or pre-bagged at \u00a315 per kg. Then there are prunes stuffed with a soft prune paste (95p each), and a whole range of French glac\u00e9 fruits from pears, figs and clementines to pineapple and kumquats - while candied fruits are merely steeped in sugar, glac\u00e9 fruits go through the process over and over until they are five or six times sweeter, which helps to explain their price tag (\u00a332.50 per kg), although glac\u00e9 citrus peel for throwing into a cake can be had for \u00a38.50 per kg. Valvona &amp; Crolla's carefully researched panettone (\u00a312.99) comes from an artisan family bakery near Milan that has been turning them out for a century. Standard next-day delivery is \u00a38 (free over \u00a3100). \u0095 Jim Ainsworth is editor of The Good Food Guide.",

      "body": "<p>Sheltering from the storm before the cozy hearth, as the dark nights of fully fledged winter close in on us, we find ourselves again in the season of escaping all this on long-haul flights to far-flung places. Now, you may well be clever enough to have figured a way to afford to turn left when you walk on the plane, but for the shuffling majority turning humbly to the right at the door, stuffed up in the crush of economy, life in the air can present a challenge. It is difficult enough to sit still for hours on end under any circumstances - especially in the air, as your body itches to stretch in order to increase the flow of blood and energy.</p> <p>The thick, warm, heavy 'air' that gently stings your nostrils as you inhale gets run through the air conditioner but once an hour for a few moments if you're lucky. People who run airlines are no more saintly or altruistic than you or I and, with the increase in fuel prices, are only able to stabilise ticket prices if they save money. The biggest saving to be made is on fuel-driven air conditioning. Observe how everyone falls asleep as the carbon levels rise then wake up as the hourly dose of freshly conditioned air is circulated.</p> <p>Cabin pressure, or lack of it, responsible for ear popping on the way up and down, and for that slightly breathless and heavy feeling in the chest, is also kept on the wrong side of comfortable to save fuel. This is known to cause coagulation of the blood, leading to possible clots, which can be fatal. Also potentially fatal are airborne microbes including TB and other respiratory germs running rampant in the cabin.</p> <p>Additionally, factor in the circadian disorientation associated with crossing time zones on the east-west axis - jet lag, in other words - the inevitable anticlimax on arrival, the difficulty of internal climate adjustment and worst of all the re-entry to our United Kingdom with all its dark angularity in the dread grip of winter.</p> <p>There are a few simple steps you can take to prevent serious internal malfunction arising from long-haul air travel. Indeed, you can optimise on this most useful facility offered by those magnificent men,and step off a flight spent in economy looking like you were in business (or from business looking like you were in first, or from first looking like you arrived in your own jet, and so on until you're looking like God himself, just blown in by chariot of fire from heaven). Undiluted tea tree oil or lavender rubbed around the nostrils will kill off all airborne germs before they gain entry to your lungs. Half an aspirin each day for a week before flying, including the day of travel, will thin the blood (having first consulted your GP if you feel you must, especially if already on warfarin or other blood thinners). Alternatively, drink nettle tea.</p> <p>Train yourself to breathe more deeply, for contrary to what you'd think, it's preferable to breathe more deeply when there's less oxygen and more carbon in order to syphon off what oxygen there is. Wriggle your toes constantly while you stretch and flex your feet, bringing your toes toward you and pushing them away throughout the flight to encourage circulation. Stand up and walk around the plane. Don't be shy. Be the odd bod that can't sit still. Stretch discreetly at the back of the plane, especially your hamstrings and shoulders. While sitting, engineer things to enable you to position your legs higher than your hips every now and then, as this helps prevent clots.</p> <p>Though this may seem sacrilegious, eschew the drinking of alcohol as it will dehydrate you and impinge on the healthy working of your kidneys (even more than it normally does). Instead drink at least one glass of mineral water every hour. Keep eating to a minimum. We tend to eat on flights for comfort rather than to assuage genuine hunger. Eating at such high altitude however, strains your organs of digestion, especially the spleen and liver. Do try not to mix protein and carbohydrates, as this combo is a real liver strainer at altitude.</p> <p>Exercise outside in the fresh air before setting off for the airport, preferably with martial arts or some other active meditation movement system, as this will help keep your immune system strong throughout the flight. Additionally, as the immune system responds instantaneously to negative or positive commands (from you), be sure to maintain a positive tone to your thoughts in transit from door to door.

      "bodyText": "Sheltering from the storm before the cozy hearth, as the dark nights of fully fledged winter close in on us, we find ourselves again in the season of escaping all this on long-haul flights to far-flung places. Now, you may well be clever enough to have figured a way to afford to turn left when you walk on the plane, but for the shuffling majority turning humbly to the right at the door, stuffed up in the crush of economy, life in the air can present a challenge. It is difficult enough to sit still for hours on end under any circumstances - especially in the air, as your body itches to stretch in order to increase the flow of blood and energy. The thick, warm, heavy 'air' that gently stings your nostrils as you inhale gets run through the air conditioner but once an hour for a few moments if you're lucky. People who run airlines are no more saintly or altruistic than you or I and, with the increase in fuel prices, are only able to stabilise ticket prices if they save money. The biggest saving to be made is on fuel-driven air conditioning. Observe how everyone falls asleep as the carbon levels rise then wake up as the hourly dose of freshly conditioned air is circulated. Cabin pressure, or lack of it, responsible for ear popping on the way up and down, and for that slightly breathless and heavy feeling in the chest, is also kept on the wrong side of comfortable to save fuel. This is known to cause coagulation of the blood, leading to possible clots, which can be fatal. Also potentially fatal are airborne microbes including TB and other respiratory germs running rampant in the cabin. Additionally, factor in the circadian disorientation associated with crossing time zones on the east-west axis - jet lag, in other words - the inevitable anticlimax on arrival, the difficulty of internal climate adjustment and worst of all the re-entry to our United Kingdom with all its dark angularity in the dread grip of winter. There are a few simple steps you can take to prevent serious internal malfunction arising from long-haul air travel. Indeed, you can optimise on this most useful facility offered by those magnificent men,and step off a flight spent in economy looking like you were in business (or from business looking like you were in first, or from first looking like you arrived in your own jet, and so on until you're looking like God himself, just blown in by chariot of fire from heaven). Undiluted tea tree oil or lavender rubbed around the nostrils will kill off all airborne germs before they gain entry to your lungs. Half an aspirin each day for a week before flying, including the day of travel, will thin the blood (having first consulted your GP if you feel you must, especially if already on warfarin or other blood thinners). Alternatively, drink nettle tea. Train yourself to breathe more deeply, for contrary to what you'd think, it's preferable to breathe more deeply when there's less oxygen and more carbon in order to syphon off what oxygen there is. Wriggle your toes constantly while you stretch and flex your feet, bringing your toes toward you and pushing them away throughout the flight to encourage circulation. Stand up and walk around the plane. Don't be shy. Be the odd bod that can't sit still. Stretch discreetly at the back of the plane, especially your hamstrings and shoulders. While sitting, engineer things to enable you to position your legs higher than your hips every now and then, as this helps prevent clots. Though this may seem sacrilegious, eschew the drinking of alcohol as it will dehydrate you and impinge on the healthy working of your kidneys (even more than it normally does). Instead drink at least one glass of mineral water every hour. Keep eating to a minimum. We tend to eat on flights for comfort rather than to assuage genuine hunger. Eating at such high altitude however, strains your organs of digestion, especially the spleen and liver. Do try not to mix protein and carbohydrates, as this combo is a real liver strainer at altitude. Exercise outside in the fresh air before setting off for the airport, preferably with martial arts or some other active meditation movement system, as this will help keep your immune system strong throughout the flight. Additionally, as the immune system responds instantaneously to negative or positive commands (from you), be sure to maintain a positive tone to your thoughts in transit from door to door. Be sure to allow yourself enough time to check in without sweating or becoming anxious. And do your utmost to relax throughout the entire procedure, as this conserves energy and helps support your immune system. To this end, also take tea of astralagus to support your spleen - being associated with the 'earth element', it is, according to Chinese medicine, weakened by leaving the ground, thus impairing your ability to resist those nasty microbes. As for circadian rhythm displacement (jet lag), set your watch to the time zone of your destination as soon as you take off and hypnotise yourself into believing it's that time from the start, for as any Einstein will tell you, time is pretty arbitrary at the best of times.

      "body": "<p>Paul Minter only has to step outside on his own for a few seconds to be filled with fear. A three-minute walk leaves him drenched in sweat and in serious pain. Being approached by a friendly shop assistant is his idea of hell. 'On the rare occasion I am out on my own walking about, I get a stabbing pain in my face. It's like someone has got a pin and is stabbing me.' </p> <p>The father of three, who lives in Bexhill, has been diagnosed as a social phobic - a growing problem which the National Society of Phobics says has far outstripped agoraphobia, which was, until recently, the most common phobia in the UK. Where agoraphobia is a fear of mass gatherings, social phobia is a fear of social interaction - of being looked at and of making a fool of yourself in public. 'A social phobic will have many fears all rolled in together,' explains Nicky Lidbetter, senior development worker at the National Phobics Society. 'There's the fear of being confined in a space, fear of being scrutinised in public, fear of blushing, fear of sweating, shaking and panic attacks. Sometimes agoraphobia is also tied in with it.' </p> <p>Between 3m and 5m people in the UK are said to suffer from some kind of phobia - an irrational fear that tends to start as a mild anxiety before snowballing out of control and rooting itself in the subconscious. Many phobics are too embarrassed to own up, for fear of being laughed at, and often don't realise that most phobias can be shifted with the help of drugs or behavioural therapy. </p> <p>Social phobia may sound trivial but it can ruin people's lives. 'It is all about low self-esteem and having to seek approval from other people,' explains Lidbetter. 'Social phobics feel like social misfits, not knowing how to act and predominantly worrying about other people noticing they are anxious in a social situations, which feeds the spiral of anxiety.' </p> <p>Minter, 32, has been forced to stop work, but from the outside appears to lead a normal life. He helps with the school run, and takes part in the weekly shop - which is fine as long as his wife Sharon is with him. But if he has to make the short walk from his children's school to his mother's house on his own, panic takes over. 'By the time I get there, I've sweated straight through my T-shirt. I'm drenched in sweat, and I've only done a three-minute walk on my own.' </p> <p>To date, no treatment has worked, though Minter has visited various doctors since he was originally diagnosed with agoraphobia when he was 17. One answer which is gaining popularity is cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), which is said to have an 80 per cent success rate. The National Phobics society swears by it, and is planning to launch a nationwide self-help recovery group for social phobics, as it claims there simply aren't enough specialists to meet demand. </p> <p>Linda Blair, clinical psychologist at the University of Bath, is one such specialist who believes 'no baby's born phobic, you learn it'. 'I find six sessions are usually enough,' she says. 'And it doesn't matter if these people have been having these phobias for 20 years or one month. If they're motivated to get over it, that's all it takes.' Blair has successfully treated a mouse phobic, who wouldn't leave the house in case she came across a cat which had caught a mouse, and a vomit phobic, who wouldn't go to parties for fear that all the partygoers would be throwing up all over the place. </p> <p>Phobias are often not taken seriously by non-sufferers, although there is an element of rationality to them. Spiders, snakes and dogs can all be dangerous, it's just that the phobic's fear gets out of control: spiders have to be killed, Tube trains avoided, and planes only taken under heavy sedation. But the more something is avoided, the worse the phobia gets. </p> <p>Phobics suffer from dizziness, nausea, tears, panic attacks, blackouts and serious head-to-toe sweats. And the panic-inducing triggers range from a fear of heights and public speaking to cotton wool, uncooked chicken, string, poverty, swallowing, snow, beards and lampposts. The body's reaction in fear goes back to our cave-dwelling days when we'd see danger and get ready to run. 'Because we don't have fangs or claws, our procedure through the ages has been to escape,' explains Blair, 'so you sweat to cool yourself to run. You feel a bit dizzy, because the blood changes from going mainly to your head to mainly to your muscles, and you feel sick because eating a meal is not a smart thing to do before you run.' </p> <p>Blair's CBT treatment teaches her patients to relax and then gets them to imagine what frightens them, from their mildest fear to their most terrifying. Once armed with relaxation and breathing techniques, the ex-phobics are able to tackle their old fears head on. </p> <p>Melanie Wiseman, 20, a psychology student at Bath University, had a problem with being touched; it started with her wrists and gradually spread all over her body. 'I had a problem having my blood pressure taken, and it spread. Then I couldn't have the inside of my wrists touched, or my arms, or the backs of my knees, or the insides of my feet, or my armpits, or my neck.' Her boyfriend simply knew what he could and could not touch. </p> <p>Wiseman would keep her arms covered at all times. But then summer would come along, and suddenly everybody would be baring their arms and legs. 'I could see the backs of other people's legs and the insides of their arms, which was quite traumatic. You worry about what might happen: what if they fell over on something sharp, that would really hurt, and there are lots of blood vessels close to the surface and you'd bleed a lot. Because they didn't fold themselves up or cover themselves up, I felt they were really vulnerable.' </p> <p>Just talking about her phobia to her mother caused her to black out, and when she joined a new practice and the doctor insisted she have her blood pressure taken, she had a full-blown panic attack in the waiting room: 'I nearly passed out. I could hardly breathe, and I was crying uncontrollably.' But after seven sessions with Dr Blair in September 1999, Wiseman was able to stroll into her doctor's and have her blood pressure taken without flinching. 'That was the only part of me that I didn't have any control of before, and it makes you feel quite weak and stupid. But now I've done that [therapy course], I feel like I can control anything. I can do whatever.' </p> <p>One of the most common phobias, which also affects a lot of people on a mild level, is arachnophobia (fear of spiders). This unfairly maligned creature is habitually flushed down the plug hole or mercilessly hoovered up out of sight, as thousands of phobics fall into the trap of demonising the spider without knowing anything about it. 'They are seen as an invader,' says Paul Pearce-Kelly from the Friendly Spider Programme at London Zoo. 'People believe a spider can physically look at them, and they make it an enemy, when in fact spiders are oblivious to people.' </p> <p>Pearce-Kelly originally planned to put up some 'nice pictures' of spiders for the programme, but changed his mind when he found some of the participants couldn't say the word spider without screaming. 'We've had people on the course who have run into the street naked because of a spider in the house, and others who won't go into sheds, garages or abroad, just to avoid them.' </p> <p>Emily Bull, 32, from Milton Keynes, wouldn't let her young children play in the garden, because she couldn't bring herself to 'brush the spiders off the garden toys. If a spider had climbed over one of them, I would have been absolutely hysterical.' If unlucky enough to be home alone when faced with a household spider, she would reach for the taps, hoover, or lob a telephone directory at it from a distance, 'then I'd leave it until my husband came home'. </p> <p>Just the sight of a spider would make Bull freeze. She would shake, cry and feel nauseous. 'I didn't do screaming, but it was a real panic attack.' But when she noticed her children begin to adopt her phobia, she decided to take action and a year ago enrolled for the course at London Zoo, which combines education with mild hypnosis. </p> <p>Since then, Bull has had up to 19 spiders living happily in her bathroom. She takes great care to catch and release spiders she finds running around the house, but above all is extremely careful never to hurt them. She puts her change of heart down to what she has learned about spiders. </p> <p>'They told us that the spiders you see marching across your living-room floor are normally boy spiders. They're looking for girls, and they've just blundered in. Spiders are also very good mothers, and it's really, really hard to be frightened of something when you think of it as a mother or as trying to find a mate - it makes you realise it's just another creature like us.' Bull can't quite believe she's rid of her life-long fear. 'I have no money, but I would still pay the same again [for the programme] to have the freedom I have now.'</p> <p> <strong> Frightful facts</strong></p> <p> \u0095 It is estimated that 4 per cent of the UK population suffers from social phobia. </p> <p> \u0095 One in 10 people will suffer a disabling anxiety disorder during their lifetime, according to the Mental Health Foundation. </p> <p> \u0095 One in three people is likely to suffer a panic attack at some point during their lives. </p> <p> \u0095 Although children can suffer from phobias, most start to become a problem in young adulthood. </p> <p> \u0095 Some of the more serious phobias, such as social phobia and agoraphobia, are also associated with drink and drug dependency. </p> <p><strong> For more information, contact:</strong></p> <p> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.phobics-society.org.uk\">National Phobics Society</a> (0161 227 9898) </p> <p> \u0095Triumph Over Phobia runs nationwide support groups.

      "body": "<p>I blame the virgin pop star. At the end of a gruelling on-my-feet-for-10-hours-without-a-break Saturday shift, I found myself in big trouble, thanks to a sudden rush on fried onion rings. The line had run out. They'd been getting slammed all after noon, and not one of them had spotted the rapidly emptying tray in the cooler. Working on the fryer is Morsel. She should have noticed and said something at least an hour ago. But she didn't, no one had 86-ed the dish, and now I was expected to dunk, coat and portion up several hundred onion rings when I should have been clocking off and claiming my free cheeseburger and Pepsi. And all because a rumour had swept the kitchen that Britney Spears and an entourage of 20 would be arriving for dinner later that night.</p> <p>Rewind a couple of months and I'd entertained far more exotic visions of the culinary arts than bagging up onion rings as a prep chef at Manchester's brand-new Hard Rock Caf\u00e9. After recently graduating from cookery school with a Cordon Bleu certificate, I could have applied for jobs in ski chalets or on board Caribbean yachts, but stupidly, I read Kitchen Confidential (\u00a316.99, Bloomsbury) by New York chef Anthony Bourdain. Suddenly, working long hours in hot, sweaty kitchens full of slightly unhinged, completely crazy or downright dangerous characters seemed incredibly glamorous. In a nutshell, his book tells the tale of 25 years in the culinary jungle of New York's restaurant scene and some of the people - including gangsters, killers and eccentrics - whom he worked for and with. It's the book Jack Kerouac would have written if he'd ever learned how to rustle up scallops in sorrel sauce, a sort of Delia Smith goes On The Road . It convinced me to shelve my dreams of the culinary high life and start where the real action was, at the very bottom of the food chain. And that's why instead of serving devilled quail's eggs with cocktails moored off Antigua at sunset, I found myself up to my elbows in goo making onion rings at the 200-cover Hard Rock Caf\u00e9. This, with apologies to el maestro Bourdain, is the story of a typical working day there.</p> <p>At 7.45am, the scene in the cavernous gloom of the empty restaurant resembles an audition for Night of the Living Dead . A procession of pasty-faced, bleary-eyed kitchen zombies try to clock in beneath the gaze of Debbie Harry, Sting, Morrissey and assorted other rock has-beens. But the machine rejects the numbers we punch in. It transpires that management has introduced a new system that means one of the bosses has to clock us in. Apparently, they didn't like the fact that some of us were clocking in before we'd changed into our whites, aprons and compulsory Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 baseball caps. You get used to pettiness like this at the good ol' Hard Rock, but it's the last thing you need when some of you only clocked off from your last shift less than four hours ago, there's a party of 60 Harley-Davidson enthusiasts expected in for lunch, and Pearl Jam is blaring out of the video screen at full volume.</p> <p>If it's a Saturday or Sunday shift, you can be sure the previous night's crew will have left you a nice surprise with which to start your day. On one occasion, the gents' locker room - about three times the size of a toilet cubicle, and a third of it is a toilet cubicle - appeared to have hosted a reconstruction of Caligula . Dirty aprons, socks, boots and ominous puddles littered the floor, the toilet bowl had been smashed and the seat ripped off. Your average kitchen staff's toilet arrangements are something best not pondered over as you tuck into your chocolate mousse when dining out.</p> <p>Another time, the carnage was confined to the walk-in cooler. The fundamental basics of stock rotation and rules about cross-contamination had been turned on their heads, shaken about violently and kicked into a lifeless pulp. A bit like the food in front of us. Nothing was where it should have been, sauces and vegetables had been dumped on the dirty floor, and trays of bacteria-dripping raw meat had been put on shelves above defenceless portions of cheesecake and brownies. Before we could even set about starting a prep list - the sauces and dishes we needed to make for that day - we had to throw out anything that might have been affected.</p> <p>Today we appear to have got off lightly - there's just a couple of bins that haven't been emptied - and I fill a sink with water and throw in several boxloads of semi-thawed chicken breasts. While that lot's defrosting, I wash my hands and start chopping and shredding leaf, iceberg and Romaine lettuces for the house (with carrots) and chiffonade (without) salad mixes. Then I start my first sauce of the day, five gallons of marinara, which involves cooking a fistful of chopped garlic and crushed red pepper in a deep stockpot before throwing in a bucketload of tomatoes and generous scoops of fresh basil, oregano, thyme and seasoning.</p> <p>While all this is going on I am, as usual, having to endure a torrent of abuse and insults from The Mouth opposite me. The Mouth cannot even cough without some expletive or other tumbling out. The Mouth likes nothing more than to question my sexuality, my intelligence or my chopping techniques, often followed up with a 'friendly' punch to my stomach. The Mouth is built like a large boulder and regularly has frailer members of the kitchen trapped in a headlock. But she's respected by all for being a fast and efficient prep chef.</p> <p>If today is a Sunday, she's also picking on Student Grant. Grant should know better. He's posh, studying English literature and likes talking about Dickens while slicing onions. And yet he turns up once a week to earn his beer money and take his punishment on the chin.</p> <p>Between nine and 10, the line chefs start arriving. If us prep chefs are the honest grafters sweating in the engine room, the line chefs are the posers who man the bridge and get all the glory. They get to swan about in full view of the paying public, while us grubby prep chefs are hidden round the corner and out of sight. And if anything goes wrong on the line, it's us who'll get the blame. Run out of BBQ sauce? Prep didn't make enough. Chicken gone cold? Prep should have kept it in the oven longer. Toothache? Prep should have booked you a dentist appointment. There's a healthy, mutual disdain between line and prep. They're only ever really under pressure at peak times, and even then all they've got to do is flip over a burger on the grill or dip a basket of chips into the fryer, while there isn't a minute when we aren't making sauces, chopping vegetables, roasting meat, baking cakes or cleaning surfaces. If it wasn't for European Employment directives and the inability of the average human body to go more than 10 hours without food and rest, restaurant owners would be happy to work their prep chefs into the ground, especially at \u00a35 an hour, while line chefs are a luxury they could ultimately do without.</p> <p>However, I have a grudging respect for one of our guys. Leon has the cool, unflappable manner of an airline pilot. And just like a hero of the skies who wouldn't want to alarm his passengers or crew after seeing one of his engine-failure lights illuminate, Leon didn't want to cause panic among his colleagues when he spotted a potential disaster today. Casually, he put down his spatula, left the grill station and muttered something into the boss's ear: 'There's no need to let the others know just yet, but we're about to run out of buns for the burgers.'</p> <p>For the Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 to have to '86' - take off the menu - its trademark dish in the middle of a busy afternoon would be enough to make Eric Clapton demand his guitar back. But Morsel - every kitchen has its odious character, called mal carne or bad meat, and ours is a pocket-sized, 17-year-old version - is sent to Tesco to save the day.</p> <p>Further up the evolutionary ladder are the 'rockers', the front-of-house staff, who are divided into several sub-species, depending on the colour of their shirts. They invariably arrive for work looking fresher and more photogenic than the rest of us. This is because they have had several hours' more sleep and are fuelled by dreams of being in the next series of Big Brother . They are weighed down by varying amounts of Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 pins, depending on how corporate they've been that month. Working on a day off or answering the telephone in the Hard Rock-approved manner - why use a simple 'Hello' when a company policy mini-statement will engender trust, goodwill and a glazed expression on the part of the caller? - will earn you a nice, enamel guitar pin. There are bonus pins up for grabs if you join in with the 'YMCA moment'. Apparently it is a tradition in Hard Rock Caf\u00e9s from Hong Kong to Honolulu that when this 70s classic is played over the PA, as many kitchen and FOH staff as possible should get into the restaurant and do the dance. I don't know what size or colour pins you can earn doing it, but I would rather spend the night naked in the cooler arm-wrestling with The Mouth.</p> <p>Then there are the staff-in-black, the bartenders who occasionally swagger through the kitchen to replenish their supplies of ice and lemon slices. Even if they weren't sporting sculptured facial hair or back-to-front baseball caps, you'd still have the irrepressible urge to serve them a five-day-old piece of chicken drizzled in last month's mayonnaise, just because they get to drink more beer and meet more women than you do.</p> <p>Before we open at midday, kitchen and FOH staff meet in the restaurant for the pre-shift. This is where we tell them what the daily Blue Plate Special is (whatever we've got loads of, usually something involving pasta), and management tests us with teasers such as: what side of the burger should the coleslaw go on, and how big is a portion of fries? The rockers are encouraged to push the latest lines in Hard Rock merchandise: today it's a fetching baby pink T-shirt for \u00a315.99.</p> <p>No sooner has service started than three deliveries arrive simultaneously at the back door. This in itself isn't a problem. The problem is that the back door is at least 400 yards and two flights of stairs away from the kitchen, and that one of the deliveries is of 96 cases of Red Bull and 20 barrels of beer. Leon, a couple of other, temporarily idle prep chefs and I are sent to sort it out. The Mouth and Morsel come along to watch and generally get in the way. After stacking the 96 cases of Red Bull outside the bar storeroom, we are told we were supposed to receive only three. By this time Leon and Morsel have gone back to the line and The Mouth has lost interest in practising her forearm smash on boxes of frozen chips, so that leaves just three of us to lug 93 cases of energy drink back to the lorry.</p> <p>Then we are faced with the 20 100lb barrels of beer which have to be taken down a flight of 30 steps. The deliverymen will have nothing to do with it and wave us a cheery goodbye. I hastily improvise a track down the stairs, using a set of aluminium ladders. At the bottom, I rig up a cushion of 5kg bags of breadcrumbs from one of the other deliveries. I'm convinced this will work, saving us all time and slipped discs, but then Chip - as in chipolata - the stock controller arrives and spoils our fun. We leave him to struggle with them alone, as the words 'drayman' and 'hernia' aren't in any of our contracts. He gets his revenge on me later by making me scrub and clean the walk-in cooler from top to bottom. Without a thermal jacket. Mal carne grande!</p> <p>Back in the kitchen, there's a commotion with Jos\u00e9 the Potwash. He's babbling away in Spanish, but John the kitchen manager can't understand a word. He thinks Jos\u00e9 must have a headache, because he keeps pointing at his forehead. Lourdes, the Peruvian head prep chef, intervenes. It turns out Jos\u00e9 is the latest victim of the phantom cap snatcher. Someone is always losing their regulation baseball cap, and rather than fork out \u00a315 for another - that's three hours' graft - it's easier to steal someone else's. Everyone has been a victim, which means every day there's at least one cook without their cap. I had mine nicked three days ago, but found another one in the crew room. It turned out that belonged to Pricey, who was in work yesterday. He wasted no time in finding a replacement, and so now it's poor Jos\u00e9's turn to wear a temporary blue hairnet until he spots a stray cap. 'Love all, serve all' it says on the back of them.</p> <p>I check with Lourdes what needs doing next. Lourdes is a graduate of a cookery school in Washington DC and completely unimpressed by my own humble cookery-school certificate. She takes pride in reminding anyone who'll listen that her home town of Lima had a Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 a month before Manchester. Whenever Gloria Estefan comes on the PA, she'll turn up the volume and start swivelling her ample hips. But she is as hard-boiled as they come. Another chef who made a suggestive comment to her was punched so hard his eyes watered. Working in an environment full of sharp and heavy equipment alongside two volatile creatures like Lourdes and The Mouth often feels like selling catapults in Gaza: you never knew when you'll have to dive for cover.</p> <p>Lourdes checks her prep list and tells me we need two gallons of smoked chicken and spinach dip. I have to squeeze every drop of moisture from 6lb of frozen spinach, and then throw together a mixture of chicken consomm\u00e9, whipping cream, liquid barbecue smoke, fresh lemon juice, Tabasco sauce, sugar, white pepper and grated Romano cheese. Into this I add the spinach and chopped poached chicken. This is my favourite dish on the menu, and I'm concerned a bit later when I spot Lourdes and the Canadian duty manager Bobby T having an intense tasting session over the batch I've just made. Eventually, Bobby T takes his half- finished portion through to Potwash. I sneak in after him and scoop up the dish before Jos\u00e9 gets his hands on it. Greedily, I devour the remains. Not only do I want to make sure it tastes OK - it does, though Bobby T thought it wasn't smoky enough - but this will also be all I get to eat until six o'clock tonight. Only when you've finished your eight-, nine- or 10-hour shift does management invite you to claim your free staff 'lunch'.</p> <p>By two o'clock on a Saturday or Sunday, the kitchen resembles an apocalyptic ballet, a blur of flesh and steel as cooks on their different stations hit their optimum rhythm. While I'm dipping chicken breasts in a mix of bread crumbs, garlic powder, cumin and Cayenne pepper (Tupelo-style Chicken, \u00a35.25), Kevin next to me is trimming pieces of pastry and filling them with chicken, spinach and cheese (Santa Fe Spring Rolls, \u00a35.25). On the other side of the station from us, The Mouth is tending a huge, simmering slab of meat on the stove with one hand (Lovely Rita's Pot Roast, \u00a37.95) while bagging up portions of penne pasta with the other. Student Grant is sliding trays of bacon into the giant Hobart oven before returning to slicing onions (Handmade Onion Rings, \u00a33.95). Behind me, Scarfinger - so called after an incident involving the bloodied tendons in his index finger and a high-speed blender - is dicing cabbage for coleslaw. Next to him, Lourdes is scooping out the innards of two dozen avocados for the guacamole. I can see there is a ripple of tickets above Leon's station on the line, and more orders are being walked in by the minute. But we are all coping. We're on top of the weekend rush. The warming drawers on the line are well stocked: chicken wings, ribs, baked potatoes, chicken noodle soup, ranch beans, pig sauce, Jim Beam sauce, BBQ sauce, we've covered all bases, no one's screaming and shouting, yet.</p> <p>It doesn't last. Apparently Peter on grill had been screaming and shouting for more bacon. The tray that Student Grant has put in the oven won't be ready for 12 minutes. Bobby T storms in from where he's been working expo - liaising between the line and the servers - and wants to know why we're behind on bacon.</p> <p>'We didn't hear the call,' says Lourdes.</p> <p>'Why not, there's no door between you guys!' says Bobby.</p> <p>'It's the music.'</p> <p>'Well, if we have to, we'll turn the music off,' says Bobby, inching threateningly towards the volume dial. I for one have had more than enough Hard Rock-cleansed AOR to last me a lifetime, and am willing Bobby to turn off the sound, but Lourdes' contrite, pleading look -' Por favor se\u00f1or , I won't be able to work if I don't get to hear Village People's 'YMCA' at least once a day' - wins a reprieve.</p> <p>As well as prepping for the daytime rush, we have to make sure we leave enough stuff made up for the evening shift, too. Today, that means baking a trayful of apple cobbler. After washing my hands, I make the pastry, stick it in the cooler to rest, and then mix together the filling of sour cream, eggs and apples. The pastry has to be baked blind, and in place of baking beans, I use rice. After it's been in the Hobart for 10 minutes, I tip out the rice and pour in the filling. While that's baking for 45 minutes, I make the topping, a crumbly mix of chopped walnuts, brown sugar and cinnamon.</p> <p>Retrieving hot trays and pans from the oven or stove is not for the faint-hearted. There is one pair of ripped, singed oven mitts and no tea towels or cloths of any sort in the kitchen. If, like The Mouth, you've got the tough, callused hands of a bareback bronco rider, you've nothing to worry about. The rest of us have to rely on thin kitchen tissue from the dispenser above the sink. By wrapping enough of it around scalding hot handles, we have to hope we don't painfully disfigure ourselves until after the food is safely delivered to its destination. The other risk, of course, is when you're removing something from an open flame on the stove. I remember at least two occasions when a wad of tissue paper was spectacularly transformed into a blazing torch. While regular patrons will be delighted to hear that the Hard Rock cannot be faulted on its food-hygiene procedures, the health and safety of its employees doesn't appear to be quite as urgent a priority. But that shouldn't put you off your Caribbean Style Pork Tenderloin (\u00a38.95).</p> <p>By mid-afternoon, the lunchtime rush is dying down. We'll probably have to replenish some of the sauces and starters before we clock off, but for now we can concentrate on closing down some of the sinks, sanitising surfaces and emptying bins. It's during this lull that the Britney Spears rumour starts.</p> <p>Previously, the only celebs we've spotted in the restaurant have been American Blues guitarist Jeff Healey - and we had to be told who he was - a handful of Man Utd's foreign stars, and that bald bloke out of The Rocky Horror Picture Show . So the news that the pouting Ms Spears has booked a table for after her show at the Arena tonight causes some excitement. So much excitement, in fact, that certain people lose their concentration, and when an unexpected six-top arrives just after five, we find out we've run out of onion rings. That's when I'm called into action, and quickly find myself in the weeds - struggling - because none of my breadcrumbs will stick to my onions, something The Mouth takes great delight in. Scarfinger and Kevin have already left, so I'm on my own until the evening prep chef clocks on, which he should have done an hour ago. By the time he does and The Mouth has stopped laughing at me, I'm into my 11th hour without a break.</p> <p>My back is killing me, my fingers are burnt, I'm spattered in guacamole and chicken blood, and I stink of garlic and cinnamon. I decide Britney Spears probably won't want to make small talk with me even if she does turn up. I console myself with my staff meal, cheeseburger and chips washed down with a beaker of Pepsi, eaten in the unventilated, windowless, 10ft-square crew room in the convivial company of a huddle of chain smokers. I arrive home 12 hours after I left, throw my apron and whites into the washing machine, and take a shower. When I slump in front of the TV, it's a choice between Celebrity Ready Steady Cook or a documentary about the M25. I throw my clothes into the tumble dryer and go to bed, dreaming of 18-year-old pop starlets and the perfect BBQ sauce. I have to clock on again in a few hours.</p> <p>\u0095 Some names have been changed</p>",

Further up the evolutionary ladder are the 'rockers', the front-of-house staff, who are divided into several sub-species, depending on the colour of their shirts. They invariably arrive for work looking fresher and more photogenic than the rest of us. This is because they have had several hours' more sleep and are fuelled by dreams of being in the next series of Big Brother . They are weighed down by varying amounts of Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 pins, depending on how corporate they've been that month. Working on a day off or answering the telephone in the Hard Rock-approved manner - why use a simple 'Hello' when a company policy mini-statement will engender trust, goodwill and a glazed expression on the part of the caller? - will earn you a nice, enamel guitar pin. There are bonus pins up for grabs if you join in with the 'YMCA moment'. Apparently it is a tradition in Hard Rock Caf\u00e9s from Hong Kong to Honolulu that when this 70s classic is played over the PA, as many kitchen and FOH staff as possible should get into the restaurant and do the dance. I don't know what size or colour pins you can earn doing it, but I would rather spend the night naked in the cooler arm-wrestling with The Mouth. Then there are the staff-in-black, the bartenders who occasionally swagger through the kitchen to replenish their supplies of ice and lemon slices. Even if they weren't sporting sculptured facial hair or back-to-front baseball caps, you'd still have the irrepressible urge to serve them a five-day-old piece of chicken drizzled in last month's mayonnaise, just because they get to drink more beer and meet more women than you do. Before we open at midday, kitchen and FOH staff meet in the restaurant for the pre-shift. This is where we tell them what the daily Blue Plate Special is (whatever we've got loads of, usually something involving pasta), and management tests us with teasers such as: what side of the burger should the coleslaw go on, and how big is a portion of fries? The rockers are encouraged to push the latest lines in Hard Rock merchandise: today it's a fetching baby pink T-shirt for \u00a315.99. No sooner has service started than three deliveries arrive simultaneously at the back door. This in itself isn't a problem. The problem is that the back door is at least 400 yards and two flights of stairs away from the kitchen, and that one of the deliveries is of 96 cases of Red Bull and 20 barrels of beer. Leon, a couple of other, temporarily idle prep chefs and I are sent to sort it out. The Mouth and Morsel come along to watch and generally get in the way. After stacking the 96 cases of Red Bull outside the bar storeroom, we are told we were supposed to receive only three. By this time Leon and Morsel have gone back to the line and The Mouth has lost interest in practising her forearm smash on boxes of frozen chips, so that leaves just three of us to lug 93 cases of energy drink back to the lorry. Then we are faced with the 20 100lb barrels of beer which have to be taken down a flight of 30 steps. The deliverymen will have nothing to do with it and wave us a cheery goodbye. I hastily improvise a track down the stairs, using a set of aluminium ladders. At the bottom, I rig up a cushion of 5kg bags of breadcrumbs from one of the other deliveries. I'm convinced this will work, saving us all time and slipped discs, but then Chip - as in chipolata - the stock controller arrives and spoils our fun. We leave him to struggle with them alone, as the words 'drayman' and 'hernia' aren't in any of our contracts. He gets his revenge on me later by making me scrub and clean the walk-in cooler from top to bottom. Without a thermal jacket. Mal carne grande! Back in the kitchen, there's a commotion with Jos\u00e9 the Potwash. He's babbling away in Spanish, but John the kitchen manager can't understand a word. He thinks Jos\u00e9 must have a headache, because he keeps pointing at his forehead. Lourdes, the Peruvian head prep chef, intervenes. It turns out Jos\u00e9 is the latest victim of the phantom cap snatcher. Someone is always losing their regulation baseball cap, and rather than fork out \u00a315 for another - that's three hours' graft - it's easier to steal someone else's. Everyone has been a victim, which means every day there's at least one cook without their cap. I had mine nicked three days ago, but found another one in the crew room. It turned out that belonged to Pricey, who was in work yesterday. He wasted no time in finding a replacement, and so now it's poor Jos\u00e9's turn to wear a temporary blue hairnet until he spots a stray cap. 'Love all, serve all' it says on the back of them. I check with Lourdes what needs doing next. Lourdes is a graduate of a cookery school in Washington DC and completely unimpressed by my own humble cookery-school certificate. She takes pride in reminding anyone who'll listen that her home town of Lima had a Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 a month before Manchester. Whenever Gloria Estefan comes on the PA, she'll turn up the volume and start swivelling her ample hips. But she is as hard-boiled as they come. Another chef who made a suggestive comment to her was punched so hard his eyes watered. Working in an environment full of sharp and heavy equipment alongside two volatile creatures like Lourdes and The Mouth often feels like selling catapults in Gaza: you never knew when you'll have to dive for cover. Lourdes checks her prep list and tells me we need two gallons of smoked chicken and spinach dip. I have to squeeze every drop of moisture from 6lb of frozen spinach, and then throw together a mixture of chicken consomm\u00e9, whipping cream, liquid barbecue smoke, fresh lemon juice, Tabasco sauce, sugar, white pepper and grated Romano cheese. Into this I add the spinach and chopped poached chicken. This is my favourite dish on the menu, and I'm concerned a bit later when I spot Lourdes and the Canadian duty manager Bobby T having an intense tasting session over the batch I've just made. Eventually, Bobby T takes his half- finished portion through to Potwash. I sneak in after him and scoop up the dish before Jos\u00e9 gets his hands on it. Greedily, I devour the remains. Not only do I want to make sure it tastes OK - it does, though Bobby T thought it wasn't smoky enough - but this will also be all I get to eat until six o'clock tonight. Only when you've finished your eight-, nine- or 10-hour shift does management invite you to claim your free staff 'lunch'. By two o'clock on a Saturday or Sunday, the kitchen resembles an apocalyptic ballet, a blur of flesh and steel as cooks on their different stations hit their optimum rhythm. While I'm dipping chicken breasts in a mix of bread crumbs, garlic powder, cumin and Cayenne pepper (Tupelo-style Chicken, \u00a35.25), Kevin next to me is trimming pieces of pastry and filling them with chicken, spinach and cheese (Santa Fe Spring Rolls, \u00a35.25). On the other side of the station from us, The Mouth is tending a huge, simmering slab of meat on the stove with one hand (Lovely Rita's Pot Roast, \u00a37.95) while bagging up portions of penne pasta with the other. Student Grant is sliding trays of bacon into the giant Hobart oven before returning to slicing onions (Handmade Onion Rings, \u00a33.95). Behind me, Scarfinger - so called after an incident involving the bloodied tendons in his index finger and a high-speed blender - is dicing cabbage for coleslaw. Next to him, Lourdes is scooping out the innards of two dozen avocados for the guacamole. I can see there is a ripple of tickets above Leon's station on the line, and more orders are being walked in by the minute. But we are all coping. We're on top of the weekend rush. The warming drawers on the line are well stocked: chicken wings, ribs, baked potatoes, chicken noodle soup, ranch beans, pig sauce, Jim Beam sauce, BBQ sauce, we've covered all bases, no one's screaming and shouting, yet. It doesn't last. Apparently Peter on grill had been screaming and shouting for more bacon. The tray that Student Grant has put in the oven won't be ready for 12 minutes. Bobby T storms in from where he's been working expo - liaising between the line and the servers - and wants to know why we're behind on bacon. 'We didn't hear the call,' says Lourdes. 'Why not, there's no door between you guys!' says Bobby. 'It's the music.' 'Well, if we have to, we'll turn the music off,' says Bobby, inching threateningly towards the volume dial. I for one have had more than enough Hard Rock-cleansed AOR to last me a lifetime, and am willing Bobby to turn off the sound, but Lourdes' contrite, pleading look -' Por favor se\u00f1or , I won't be able to work if I don't get to hear Village People's 'YMCA' at least once a day' - wins a reprieve. As well as prepping for the daytime rush, we have to make sure we leave enough stuff made up for the evening shift, too. Today, that means baking a trayful of apple cobbler. After washing my hands, I make the pastry, stick it in the cooler to rest, and then mix together the filling of sour cream, eggs and apples. The pastry has to be baked blind, and in place of baking beans, I use rice. After it's been in the Hobart for 10 minutes, I tip out the rice and pour in the filling. While that's baking for 45 minutes, I make the topping, a crumbly mix of chopped walnuts, brown sugar and cinnamon. Retrieving hot trays and pans from the oven or stove is not for the faint-hearted. There is one pair of ripped, singed oven mitts and no tea towels or cloths of any sort in the kitchen. If, like The Mouth, you've got the tough, callused hands of a bareback bronco rider, you've nothing to worry about. The rest of us have to rely on thin kitchen tissue from the dispenser above the sink. By wrapping enough of it around scalding hot handles, we have to hope we don't painfully disfigure ourselves until after the food is safely delivered to its destination. The other risk, of course, is when you're removing something from an open flame on the stove. I remember at least two occasions when a wad of tissue paper was spectacularly transformed into a blazing torch. While regular patrons will be delighted to hear that the Hard Rock cannot be faulted on its food-hygiene procedures, the health and safety of its employees doesn't appear to be quite as urgent a priority. But that shouldn't put you off your Caribbean Style Pork Tenderloin (\u00a38.95). By mid-afternoon, the lunchtime rush is dying down. We'll probably have to replenish some of the sauces and starters before we clock off, but for now we can concentrate on closing down some of the sinks, sanitising surfaces and emptying bins. It's during this lull that the Britney Spears rumour starts. Previously, the only celebs we've spotted in the restaurant have been American Blues guitarist Jeff Healey - and we had to be told who he was - a handful of Man Utd's foreign stars, and that bald bloke out of The Rocky Horror Picture Show . So the news that the pouting Ms Spears has booked a table for after her show at the Arena tonight causes some excitement. So much excitement, in fact, that certain people lose their concentration, and when an unexpected six-top arrives just after five, we find out we've run out of onion rings. That's when I'm called into action, and quickly find myself in the weeds - struggling - because none of my breadcrumbs will stick to my onions, something The Mouth takes great delight in. Scarfinger and Kevin have already left, so I'm on my own until the evening prep chef clocks on, which he should have done an hour ago. By the time he does and The Mouth has stopped laughing at me, I'm into my 11th hour without a break. My back is killing me, my fingers are burnt, I'm spattered in guacamole and chicken blood, and I stink of garlic and cinnamon. I decide Britney Spears probably won't want to make small talk with me even if she does turn up. I console myself with my staff meal, cheeseburger and chips washed down with a beaker of Pepsi, eaten in the unventilated, windowless, 10ft-square crew room in the convivial company of a huddle of chain smokers. I arrive home 12 hours after I left, throw my apron and whites into the washing machine, and take a shower. When I slump in front of the TV, it's a choice between Celebrity Ready Steady Cook or a documentary about the M25. I throw my clothes into the tumble dryer and go to bed, dreaming of 18-year-old pop starlets and the perfect BBQ sauce. I have to clock on again in a few hours. \u0095 Some names have been changed",

      "body": "<p>Tweenagers. It's one of those labels, like 'middle youth', that marketers stick on to new consumer groups to flatter them into buying more of the products that are essential for their life-stage and life-style. In the case of 'middle youth' it's the thirty- and fortysomethings who don't want to grow up, and in the case of tweenagers, it's the eight- to 12-year-olds who want to grow up as fast as they can, and who mimic the tastes and behaviour of the teenagers they can't wait to become.</p> <p>The two trends are closely related, but it's the tweenies that are suddenly causing a commotion. While we've extended adolescence to 40 and beyond, it looks as if we've shrunk childhood to eight and below. We know that the tweenies are not like we were at the same age, but how different are they? Is this just another new chapter in the constantly shifting history of childhood or, as many social commentators believe, the end of childhood as we know it?</p> <p>There are about 4m eight- to 12-year-olds in the UK, and since the mid-90s they have evolved into a distinct social and economic group. Forget Furbies or Lego kits. All the tweenies want for Christmas are high-ticket techno toys, such as PlayStation 2, mobile phones and portable MP3 players, on which they will listen to Steps, S Club 7, Craig David, Robbie Williams and Westlife. Their clothes are not recognisably 'children's clothes', but just smaller versions of the kit teenagers buy in Morgan, Top Shop and New Look, or sportswear labels such as Nike or Diadora. High-street success stories such as Tammy and Claire's Accessories have seen enormous growth purely on the back of the tweenie pound, a market estimated to be worth \u00a330bn.</p> <p>Most of these children have lived through a decade of economic boom, in which affluence has increased across the country as a whole and trickled down to them. According to Walls Monitor, the UK agency that monitors children's incomes, pocket money rose 32 per cent between 1993 and 1999, averaging out at around \u00a35 per week for the tweenies. But that only reveals a fraction of their economic power. Later childbearing means that parents are having fewer children not just later in their lives, but further along their career paths, so there is more disposable family income, and growing evidence of the ruthless efficacy of 'pester power': tweenies are increasingly responsible for decisions about family spending. Hard working, two-career parents and the rising divorce rate have bred fundamental changes to patterns of family life in which younger children spend more time without close supervision, and are often responsible for their own meal times and after-school activities, and a parallel culture of parental guilt, which is often salved by more money and more presents.</p> <p>Affluent, aspirational and apparently sophisticated, tweenies are a marketer's dream and the Daily Mail 's nightmare. Little girls of nine and 10 running around in cropped tops and body tattoos, watching EastEnders and Friends , getting up to who-knows-what with God- knows-who in internet chat rooms. Last summer, the Bristol Institute of Child Health gave a new focus to our rumbling anxieties about tweenagers when the results of its large-scale study of 14,000 children revealed that one in six girls and one in 14 boys are now showing signs of puberty by the time they are eight years old. That compares to one in 100 girls and one in 150 boys a generation ago. The tweenies, it appears, are literally growing up faster.</p> <p>Dr Russel Viner is an endocrinologist at Great Ormond Street hospital, and a leading consultant in adolescent medicine. 'The average age for the onset of puberty in girls is still between 10 and 11, when the first bodily changes start occurring. Menstruation begins at 13. Those ages have come down dramatically since the turn of the century, when menstruation began at around 17, and the main cause for that drop was probably improved nutrition. For boys, about 50 per cent will start to show symptoms of puberty at 11.'</p> <p>Since the 60s, official figures have remained more or less stable, and there is not yet any solid medical evidence that more children are hitting early puberty. 'But our last set of reliable data only went up to 1990, so there may have been change since then. The Bristol study is particularly interesting because it's the closest we've come to getting any kind of evidence that there is any significant rise in earlier development,' he says. 'And anecdotally, we're hearing a lot more stories of girls starting their periods in junior school. There's certainly a rise in concern among teachers and parents.'</p> <p>Helen Duke is one of those parents. Her daughter Kelly was just seven when she developed breast buds, followed a year later by pubic hair and her first period. Helen was distraught and Kelly became upset and withdrawn. 'When I found blood in her underwear, my first thought was that she had some kind of infection. I took her to the doctor, who warned that it could be the start of her periods, and I was just shocked. I hadn't even properly explained to her about periods - I thought we had years before we had to deal with all that. My doctor reassured me that it isn't so uncommon these days, but I just instinctively felt that it was wrong, that she was too young to have to handle this.'</p> <p>According to Viner, Helen's reaction is a common one. 'Most parents have the same instinct. They want to protect their child from having to grow up too soon, and there is also anxiety about children's sexuality. Parents worry that early puberty means their child will develop earlier in every way, though there's no reason why they should. Very early puberty - say at five or six - needs medical intervention. But where a girl is eight or a boy nine, we don't look for medical causes. At this age, there's no real cause to be concerned and no effect on height or general health. What your child needs is for you to be calm, and to offer practical and emotional support.'</p> <p>While there may be no physical health risk, psychological problems are common. Early puberty is more common in girls than in boys, he says, and tends to affect them differently. 'For girls, the best-case scenario is to start puberty bang on time, and at the same time as her friends. Second best is to be a late starter, and worst is to be early.' Boys are the opposite: 'Their best-case scenario is still to be on time with everybody else, but second best is to be early, and worst is to be late.'</p> <p>'It was embarrassing for Kelly to be the only girl in her class to have periods,' says Helen, 'and it was impossible to hide the fact that she was developing. I became paranoid about older boys and men looking at her in a different way. I had to talk to her about sex, and about sexual exploitation, because her body needed to know about it, even if her mind didn't.'</p> <p>Kelly's situation improved when she was 10 and another girl in her class started her periods. 'I felt happier that she wasn't alone,' admits Helen. 'I didn't want her to feel like a freak. But when you see them together, you can't help noticing that they look about four years older than the other girls in their class. I worry that because they look mature, people will treat them as if they really are.'</p> <p>While the traditional mother/ daughter periods pep talk begins, 'Now you're a woman', that's just not appropriate for a girl who isn't even out of junior school. Early puberty doesn't mean that your child is no longer a child, even if she's shooting up in height and developing curves. 'This is still just an eight-year-old - she just happens to have periods,' says Viner. 'She will pick up cues about herself and about how to deal with her changing body from her parents and the people around her. If we are seeing a trend towards earlier puberty, then it's become even more of an imperative that we get serious about proper sex education. It should not be something furtive. We need really good, calm, age-appropriate information.'</p> <p>If we don't know yet how big a shift there has been towards earlier puberty, we're even further from knowing why it's happening at all. Most of the research has been done in the States, where the trend is more documented than in the UK.</p> <p>'I think the one solid reason we can point to is weight,' says Viner. 'We know that there is a link between obesity and early puberty, and we also know that obesity in children is increasing.' Another reason could be population trends. Black and Asian girls tend to hit puberty earlier, and some of these cases may reflect the fact that we've become a more mixed society.</p> <p>Beyond that, we're essentially baffled by our children's bodies and can only offer up theories ranging from increased exposure to chemicals in the environment, to the hormones fed to animals and dispersed through the food chain. Some psychologists have pointed to modern childhood itself as a possible cause, linking tweenies' behaviour and their immersion in a more adult, sexualised world as actually triggering earlier development. According to Marcia Herman-Giddens, an eminent paediatric researcher in the USA, this last theory isn't as left-field as it sounds. 'It wouldn't be scientific to dismiss it,' she has said. 'Seeing things can affect us physiologically.' And there's no doubt that the tweenies are seeing things that eight- to 12-year-olds have never seen before.</p> <p>Tweenies watch an incredible amount of television - an average of around four hours a day. A lot of that TV is watched while parents are still at work, or exhausted from being at work, and collapsed in another room eating a late dinner or trying to find tomorrow's PE kit. They watch all the soaps - EastEnders is a particular current favourite - Dawson's Creek, the American series about teen relationships, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Sabrina the Teenage Witch, The Simpsons and Friends, even though it is about the lives of a group of twenty- and thirty-something New Yorkers.</p> <p>The nine o'clock watershed is a joke in digital households and in a world where large numbers of children have access to a separate TV. Consequently, children who have never even been kissed know all there is to know about modern sexual manners, witty Men Are From Mars-based put-downs, sexually transmitted diseases, adultery and how to kill zombies. Since the Monica Lewinsky case, there isn't a 10-year-old in the country who doesn't know what oral sex is.</p> <p>Interestingly, most of those programmes are very popular with adults, too, as youth and adult cultures are increasingly becoming merged.

This kind of exposure, he argues, erodes childhood because it takes away all adults' mysteries and secrets. And without those secrets - the adultery, the betrayals, the highly charged emotional and sexual scenarios, the complex drama and mess of adult lives - 'There is no childhood.'</p> <p>Today's tweenies are the children of late-baby-boomer parents, the generation nauseatingly tagged 'middle youth' because it doesn't want to let go of its grasp on youth culture just because it's turning 40. Dads and sons might wear Nike or Gap, while mothers and daughters wear different-sized versions of the strappy tops and clam-digger trousers that were so ubiquitous last summer. The grandparents might say that the mother was too old for clam diggers and the daughter too young for the strappy top, but we don't like those kind of demarcations. We like sharing our children's culture - it makes us feel young, and them feel sophisticated - and we like hanging out with our kids, as senior buddies rather than old-fashioned parents, watching the same programmes, parroting the same Budweiser slogans. If we start to differentiate too much between youth and adult culture, we'll be forced into the boring old grown-up camp, cut off from youth culture and forced to pass the baton to the next generation.</p> <p>Boomers are more liberal and democratic parents than their predecessors were, as well as being more cash-rich and time-poor. In the past 20 years, we've gradually become a far more child-focused society, where the rights, opinions and desires of children have become respected and taken seriously to an unprecedented degree. We allow our children to make choices, to have what they want for dinner instead of being force-fed whatever we decide is good for them, to choose their own clothes and have an equal say in many family decisions. But all of this well-meaning liberalism means that it's harder for us to set boundaries for them.</p> <p>As Julie Flynn, the mother of an eight-year-old boy and an 11-year-old girl says, 'You can't encourage them to express their opinions and preferences, and then turn around and say, \"Thanks for sharing that with me, but now you're just going to do what I say is best.\"' So we let our tweenies decide for themselves what they will watch, wear and buy. And one consequence is that children are increasingly exposed to the adult world almost from birth.</p> <p>'This is where children really are growing older faster,' says Viner. 'The biggest change is not physical but social and psychological.' And tweenies don't just enter the world of adults through the media. The increase in their rights mirrors an increase in real responsibilities. Too old for full-time child care, but too young to be allowed to roam around unsupervised, they increasingly make their own way home from school, spend a lot of time literally or effectively alone with their TVs and PCs, and choosing their own foods (crisps and chocolates).</p> <p>But that's not to say that their lives are full of aimless free space. Academic pressure kicks in with the tweenies, with most 11-year-olds getting two hours' homework every night. Julie Flynn describes her daughter's year-six SATS 'as like a tweenie version of O levels. All these 10-year-olds walking around the playground with textbooks, revising and worrying. That's definitely new. I felt no sense of academic pressure until at least the third year of secondary school.' George Marsh, the head teacher of Dulwich College prep school in south London, recently made a passionate plea for children to be given some of their time back. 'What sort of education are children receiving if their primary schools are doing little in year six except working towards tests? We've all become hysterical about exams and academic tables,' he said. 'These children deserve a childhood,' he added. 'They need our protection.'</p> <p>Besides an awful lot of information about fictional sex, the tweenies are watching a lot of programmes and films about themselves - or about the older selves they aspire to be. There has been a remarkable increase in the percentage of both TV and movie content directed at and about kids, as the teen and tweenie market has become increasingly large and profitable. The fact that the success of Titanic was based on crowds of young girls going to see the film three, four or five times (and then renting it later on video) has passed into box-office legend, and for every two movies aimed at an 'adult' audience, there are at least eight aimed at the youth market.</p> <p>The fictional kids that real kids watch in these films and programmes are versions of themselves that they want to see - or that we think they want to see. There's no doubt that audience sizes and profits from spin-off merchandising are higher when the youth audience likes or relates to the characters it sees. But they are also portrayed in the way we want to see them. So we get smart, wise-cracking kids with bottomless stores of ingenuity and snappy one liners (Home Alone, Look Who's Talking, Buffy and Sabrina) or children who are the moral centre of the action, spiritually and emotionally more evolved than the adults around them (The Sixth Sense, The Kid, Jerry Maguire, Buffy again).</p> <p>In a reflection of our own changing attitudes to children and childhood, as well as a sap to the tweenie pound, children have moved in images in popular culture from the often alien, demonic creatures of many 70s films (The Omen, The Exorcist, Demon Seed) to the smart, lovable, sophisticated and empowered heroes of today. The point is that the child, hopelessly idealised, is always wiser than the man, exposing our current complicated state of fear and worship of our children.</p> <p>In portraying them as wised-up, emotionally mature and verbally sophisticated, we're teaching tweenies how to talk and behave - another reason that they often seem older than they really are. Up to the age of eight, a child's family is pretty much the centre of their universe, and their biggest influence. After that, age, peer groups and other role models become increasingly important, and it's from TV and pop culture that the tweenies take their role models.</p> <p>In the UK, many marketing professionals date the rise of tweenagers quite precisely - to 8 July 1996, the date of the release of 'Wannabe', the Spice Girls's first single. According to Karen Brooks, spokesperson for the Claire's Accessories chain, the appearance of Sporty, Scary, Ginger, Posh and Baby unleashed a tsunami of genuine wannabes - a generation of little girls with money and aspirations, just waiting for a focus. While boy tweenies are big on sportswear brands and techno toys, the tweenie-as-big-consumer trend is largely a female phenomenon. For girls, shopping is not just fun in its own right, but a way for them to express and engage with the simplistic but powerful brand messages that thrillingly echo the tweenie zeitgeist: girl power; total babes; friendship never ends.</p> <p>'Before the Spice Girls there were girl singers and boy bands,' she says, 'but there had never been a girl band like them before. They were just like a 21st-century version of Barbie - real girls, in all shapes and sizes, who wore an ever-changing array of cool and trendy outfits that the little girls could admire and copy, and who celebrated the fun and strength of being a modern girl.' This not only extended the market for record sales, but created a major boost for clothing, accessories and make-up companies which began to market directly and aggressively to the pre-teens. 'We opened Claire's Accessories in the UK five years ago,' says Karen Brooks, 'and there's no doubt that the timing was perfect.' Claire's sells make-up, jewellery, stationery and accessories, all priced as pocket-money purchases, so the little girls can shop autonomously, without parents. 'It's like a girlie grotto,' says Brooks. 'It's a shop designed for the girls themselves, not somewhere where you have to go with your parents.'</p> <p>At the moment, the younger girls are mad for karma beads and bowling bags. 'General fashion trends are important, but they're also incredibly influenced by pop and TV stars, and frankly they just aren't the same as they were in my day!' says Brooks, who is 38. 'We had Val Singleton on Blue Peter , and while we may have loved her, we didn't exactly aspire to look like her, did we? Today's tweenagers have Kat Dealy and a host of young, trendy role models to emulate.'</p> <p>Cassie More is brand director at Tammy, the market-leading fashion store for nine- to 15-year-old girls. That translates to mini-versions of whatever clothes are in fashion for teenagers and adults - nine-year-olds can buy sportswear like All Saints, tight fitting, strappy tops and dresses like Posh Spice's and endless permutations on whatever Britney is wearing. The St Tropez trend currently in vogue at the high end of the fashion market has filtered down to Tammy in the form of catsuits covered in sequins, predicted to be huge for Christmas party wear.</p> <p>'Young girls are more influenced by role models and street fashion than women,' says More, 'and trends come and go faster. When Oasis appeared on Top of the Pops doing 'Wonderwall' wearing khaki, we sold out of khaki in all our shops the following Saturday. We had a similar experience with All Saints and the little strappy T-shirts.'</p> <p>Little girls love Tammy, but their parents don't always feel the same way. 'I do get odd letters of complaint,' admits More. 'I've had parents say that the clothes are indecent for children. We think we're being responsible in our designs and buying and we don't want to turn parents off, but we're a shop for the girls, not for their mums and dads.'</p> <p>She believes that there is no fundamental difference between today's tweenies and our own pre-teen years. 'If there had been a version of Tammy when I was a little girl I would have loved it. Children haven't really changed - we've just acknowledged them as a group and started to give them what they really want. For our shoppers, dressing in fashionable clothes is about fitting in with their peers, and about trying out their new identity as teenagers in a way that's safe and girly and fun. They want to look trendy, not sexy. Adults have always worried about the next generation being more sophisticated and advanced than they were, that's all.'</p> <p>Rachel Bowlby is the author of the upcoming Carried Away: The Invention of Modern Supermarkets. She agrees that tweenies are just another step along the path of consumer culture, just as we were and just as our parents were before us. We worry about their advanced materialism, but she points out that children have been acknowledged and targeted as important consumers in their own right since the period between the wars. She quotes from a sweetshop manual published in 1939: 'There are few better shoppers than children, who are always on the lookout for something new, and want good value for money.'</p> <p>Cinemas, she says, were producing special displays of new chocolate bars in their foyers whenever there was a children's film showing as early as the 40s. 'All that's changed is that the market has become more mature, and manufacturers are exploiting every niche even further,' she says, 'but there's no evidence of any real qualitative difference between today's tweenagers and their parents with their Jackie magazines. That was ostensibly aimed as 16-year-olds and bought by 11-year-olds, just as 12-year-olds buy magazines like J17 or 19 today.'</p> <p>Tweenies are different, but they're also the same. They have evolved in a world of mass media, technological innovation, social change and affluence. No amount of anxiety or concerned parenting can turn the clock back on that. We can't protect them from the adult world of violence, relationships, consumerism or anxiety. We have to stop wringing our hands about the end of childhood and develop new strategies to defend their rights as consumers and human beings, and to teach them filters for the blizzards of information, advertising and marketing which are their daily landscapes. In Sweden, there is a ban on advertising to under-12s. It hopes to use its presidency of the EU next year to extend that ban to the rest of Europe, including the UK, where the advertising of toys alone amounted to \u00a3182m in the past 12 months. In a media age, we need new blueprints for parenting, education and childcare.</p> <p>While tweenagers may be more exposed to adult realities and responsibilities, they are also better educated, more confident and ambitious and more listened to than any previous generation. They ask more questions, challenge more assumptions and don't blindly accept any authority. Anyone personally involved with children of this age can't fail to have noticed their sense of morality and justice, and of their concern for political issues, such as the environment and homelessness. While we fret that they don't 'play' like children anymore, we conveniently forget that notions of an ideal childhood are very modern, and that previous generations of children went down mines, up chimneys and to war. Today's eight- to 12-year-olds are living a far more 'ideal' life than their predecessors.</p> <p>I have two tweenies of my own and, through them, contact with lots more. In spite of the speed and complexity of their lives, and the variety of their backgrounds and personalities, they share the outstanding characteristics of their age: open minds, optimism and faith in themselves and the future. They are remarkably innocent, not in a sentimental sense - they can be aggressive, rude, greedy, even cruel - but in their freedom from cynicism and guile.</p> <p>Tweenies are boomers' babies, the children of a prolonged period of peace and prosperity. We don't know yet how they will turn out, what kind of world they will create for themselves when they become adults, but there's at least as much reason for optimism as anxiety.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Tweenagers. It's one of those labels, like 'middle youth', that marketers stick on to new consumer groups to flatter them into buying more of the products that are essential for their life-stage and life-style. In the case of 'middle youth' it's the thirty- and fortysomethings who don't want to grow up, and in the case of tweenagers, it's the eight- to 12-year-olds who want to grow up as fast as they can, and who mimic the tastes and behaviour of the teenagers they can't wait to become. The two trends are closely related, but it's the tweenies that are suddenly causing a commotion. While we've extended adolescence to 40 and beyond, it looks as if we've shrunk childhood to eight and below. We know that the tweenies are not like we were at the same age, but how different are they? Is this just another new chapter in the constantly shifting history of childhood or, as many social commentators believe, the end of childhood as we know it? There are about 4m eight- to 12-year-olds in the UK, and since the mid-90s they have evolved into a distinct social and economic group. Forget Furbies or Lego kits. All the tweenies want for Christmas are high-ticket techno toys, such as PlayStation 2, mobile phones and portable MP3 players, on which they will listen to Steps, S Club 7, Craig David, Robbie Williams and Westlife. Their clothes are not recognisably 'children's clothes', but just smaller versions of the kit teenagers buy in Morgan, Top Shop and New Look, or sportswear labels such as Nike or Diadora. High-street success stories such as Tammy and Claire's Accessories have seen enormous growth purely on the back of the tweenie pound, a market estimated to be worth \u00a330bn. Most of these children have lived through a decade of economic boom, in which affluence has increased across the country as a whole and trickled down to them. According to Walls Monitor, the UK agency that monitors children's incomes, pocket money rose 32 per cent between 1993 and 1999, averaging out at around \u00a35 per week for the tweenies. But that only reveals a fraction of their economic power. Later childbearing means that parents are having fewer children not just later in their lives, but further along their career paths, so there is more disposable family income, and growing evidence of the ruthless efficacy of 'pester power': tweenies are increasingly responsible for decisions about family spending. Hard working, two-career parents and the rising divorce rate have bred fundamental changes to patterns of family life in which younger children spend more time without close supervision, and are often responsible for their own meal times and after-school activities, and a parallel culture of parental guilt, which is often salved by more money and more presents. Affluent, aspirational and apparently sophisticated, tweenies are a marketer's dream and the Daily Mail 's nightmare. Little girls of nine and 10 running around in cropped tops and body tattoos, watching EastEnders and Friends , getting up to who-knows-what with God- knows-who in internet chat rooms. Last summer, the Bristol Institute of Child Health gave a new focus to our rumbling anxieties about tweenagers when the results of its large-scale study of 14,000 children revealed that one in six girls and one in 14 boys are now showing signs of puberty by the time they are eight years old. That compares to one in 100 girls and one in 150 boys a generation ago. The tweenies, it appears, are literally growing up faster. Dr Russel Viner is an endocrinologist at Great Ormond Street hospital, and a leading consultant in adolescent medicine. 'The average age for the onset of puberty in girls is still between 10 and 11, when the first bodily changes start occurring. Menstruation begins at 13. Those ages have come down dramatically since the turn of the century, when menstruation began at around 17, and the main cause for that drop was probably improved nutrition. For boys, about 50 per cent will start to show symptoms of puberty at 11.' Since the 60s, official figures have remained more or less stable, and there is not yet any solid medical evidence that more children are hitting early puberty. 'But our last set of reliable data only went up to 1990, so there may have been change since then. The Bristol study is particularly interesting because it's the closest we've come to getting any kind of evidence that there is any significant rise in earlier development,' he says. 'And anecdotally, we're hearing a lot more stories of girls starting their periods in junior school. There's certainly a rise in concern among teachers and parents.' Helen Duke is one of those parents. Her daughter Kelly was just seven when she developed breast buds, followed a year later by pubic hair and her first period. Helen was distraught and Kelly became upset and withdrawn. 'When I found blood in her underwear, my first thought was that she had some kind of infection. I took her to the doctor, who warned that it could be the start of her periods, and I was just shocked. I hadn't even properly explained to her about periods - I thought we had years before we had to deal with all that. My doctor reassured me that it isn't so uncommon these days, but I just instinctively felt that it was wrong, that she was too young to have to handle this.' According to Viner, Helen's reaction is a common one. 'Most parents have the same instinct. They want to protect their child from having to grow up too soon, and there is also anxiety about children's sexuality. Parents worry that early puberty means their child will develop earlier in every way, though there's no reason why they should. Very early puberty - say at five or six - needs medical intervention. But where a girl is eight or a boy nine, we don't look for medical causes. At this age, there's no real cause to be concerned and no effect on height or general health. What your child needs is for you to be calm, and to offer practical and emotional support.' While there may be no physical health risk, psychological problems are common. Early puberty is more common in girls than in boys, he says, and tends to affect them differently. 'For girls, the best-case scenario is to start puberty bang on time, and at the same time as her friends. Second best is to be a late starter, and worst is to be early.' Boys are the opposite: 'Their best-case scenario is still to be on time with everybody else, but second best is to be early, and worst is to be late.' 'It was embarrassing for Kelly to be the only girl in her class to have periods,' says Helen, 'and it was impossible to hide the fact that she was developing. I became paranoid about older boys and men looking at her in a different way. I had to talk to her about sex, and about sexual exploitation, because her body needed to know about it, even if her mind didn't.' Kelly's situation improved when she was 10 and another girl in her class started her periods. 'I felt happier that she wasn't alone,' admits Helen. 'I didn't want her to feel like a freak. But when you see them together, you can't help noticing that they look about four years older than the other girls in their class. I worry that because they look mature, people will treat them as if they really are.' While the traditional mother/ daughter periods pep talk begins, 'Now you're a woman', that's just not appropriate for a girl who isn't even out of junior school. Early puberty doesn't mean that your child is no longer a child, even if she's shooting up in height and developing curves. 'This is still just an eight-year-old - she just happens to have periods,' says Viner. 'She will pick up cues about herself and about how to deal with her changing body from her parents and the people around her. If we are seeing a trend towards earlier puberty, then it's become even more of an imperative that we get serious about proper sex education. It should not be something furtive. We need really good, calm, age-appropriate information.' If we don't know yet how big a shift there has been towards earlier puberty, we're even further from knowing why it's happening at all. Most of the research has been done in the States, where the trend is more documented than in the UK. 'I think the one solid reason we can point to is weight,' says Viner. 'We know that there is a link between obesity and early puberty, and we also know that obesity in children is increasing.' Another reason could be population trends. Black and Asian girls tend to hit puberty earlier, and some of these cases may reflect the fact that we've become a more mixed society. Beyond that, we're essentially baffled by our children's bodies and can only offer up theories ranging from increased exposure to chemicals in the environment, to the hormones fed to animals and dispersed through the food chain. Some psychologists have pointed to modern childhood itself as a possible cause, linking tweenies' behaviour and their immersion in a more adult, sexualised world as actually triggering earlier development. According to Marcia Herman-Giddens, an eminent paediatric researcher in the USA, this last theory isn't as left-field as it sounds. 'It wouldn't be scientific to dismiss it,' she has said. 'Seeing things can affect us physiologically.' And there's no doubt that the tweenies are seeing things that eight- to 12-year-olds have never seen before. Tweenies watch an incredible amount of television - an average of around four hours a day. A lot of that TV is watched while parents are still at work, or exhausted from being at work, and collapsed in another room eating a late dinner or trying to find tomorrow's PE kit. They watch all the soaps - EastEnders is a particular current favourite - Dawson's Creek, the American series about teen relationships, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Sabrina the Teenage Witch, The Simpsons and Friends, even though it is about the lives of a group of twenty- and thirty-something New Yorkers. The nine o'clock watershed is a joke in digital households and in a world where large numbers of children have access to a separate TV. Consequently, children who have never even been kissed know all there is to know about modern sexual manners, witty Men Are From Mars-based put-downs, sexually transmitted diseases, adultery and how to kill zombies. Since the Monica Lewinsky case, there isn't a 10-year-old in the country who doesn't know what oral sex is. Interestingly, most of those programmes are very popular with adults, too, as youth and adult cultures are increasingly becoming merged. How many times have you heard somebody commend The Simpsons or Buffy precisely because 'It works on two levels, so kids and adults like it.' As the sociologist Neil Postman has pointed out, the growth of television has meant the dissolution of 'the information hierarchy' so that 'everything is for everybody'. This kind of exposure, he argues, erodes childhood because it takes away all adults' mysteries and secrets. And without those secrets - the adultery, the betrayals, the highly charged emotional and sexual scenarios, the complex drama and mess of adult lives - 'There is no childhood.' Today's tweenies are the children of late-baby-boomer parents, the generation nauseatingly tagged 'middle youth' because it doesn't want to let go of its grasp on youth culture just because it's turning 40. Dads and sons might wear Nike or Gap, while mothers and daughters wear different-sized versions of the strappy tops and clam-digger trousers that were so ubiquitous last summer.

If we start to differentiate too much between youth and adult culture, we'll be forced into the boring old grown-up camp, cut off from youth culture and forced to pass the baton to the next generation. Boomers are more liberal and democratic parents than their predecessors were, as well as being more cash-rich and time-poor. In the past 20 years, we've gradually become a far more child-focused society, where the rights, opinions and desires of children have become respected and taken seriously to an unprecedented degree. We allow our children to make choices, to have what they want for dinner instead of being force-fed whatever we decide is good for them, to choose their own clothes and have an equal say in many family decisions.

George Marsh, the head teacher of Dulwich College prep school in south London, recently made a passionate plea for children to be given some of their time back. 'What sort of education are children receiving if their primary schools are doing little in year six except working towards tests? We've all become hysterical about exams and academic tables,' he said. 'These children deserve a childhood,' he added. 'They need our protection.' Besides an awful lot of information about fictional sex, the tweenies are watching a lot of programmes and films about themselves - or about the older selves they aspire to be. There has been a remarkable increase in the percentage of both TV and movie content directed at and about kids, as the teen and tweenie market has become increasingly large and profitable. The fact that the success of Titanic was based on crowds of young girls going to see the film three, four or five times (and then renting it later on video) has passed into box-office legend, and for every two movies aimed at an 'adult' audience, there are at least eight aimed at the youth market. The fictional kids that real kids watch in these films and programmes are versions of themselves that they want to see - or that we think they want to see. There's no doubt that audience sizes and profits from spin-off merchandising are higher when the youth audience likes or relates to the characters it sees. But they are also portrayed in the way we want to see them. So we get smart, wise-cracking kids with bottomless stores of ingenuity and snappy one liners (Home Alone, Look Who's Talking, Buffy and Sabrina) or children who are the moral centre of the action, spiritually and emotionally more evolved than the adults around them (The Sixth Sense, The Kid, Jerry Maguire, Buffy again). In a reflection of our own changing attitudes to children and childhood, as well as a sap to the tweenie pound, children have moved in images in popular culture from the often alien, demonic creatures of many 70s films (The Omen, The Exorcist, Demon Seed) to the smart, lovable, sophisticated and empowered heroes of today. The point is that the child, hopelessly idealised, is always wiser than the man, exposing our current complicated state of fear and worship of our children. In portraying them as wised-up, emotionally mature and verbally sophisticated, we're teaching tweenies how to talk and behave - another reason that they often seem older than they really are. Up to the age of eight, a child's family is pretty much the centre of their universe, and their biggest influence. After that, age, peer groups and other role models become increasingly important, and it's from TV and pop culture that the tweenies take their role models. In the UK, many marketing professionals date the rise of tweenagers quite precisely - to 8 July 1996, the date of the release of 'Wannabe', the Spice Girls's first single. According to Karen Brooks, spokesperson for the Claire's Accessories chain, the appearance of Sporty, Scary, Ginger, Posh and Baby unleashed a tsunami of genuine wannabes - a generation of little girls with money and aspirations, just waiting for a focus. While boy tweenies are big on sportswear brands and techno toys, the tweenie-as-big-consumer trend is largely a female phenomenon. For girls, shopping is not just fun in its own right, but a way for them to express and engage with the simplistic but powerful brand messages that thrillingly echo the tweenie zeitgeist: girl power; total babes; friendship never ends. 'Before the Spice Girls there were girl singers and boy bands,' she says, 'but there had never been a girl band like them before. They were just like a 21st-century version of Barbie - real girls, in all shapes and sizes, who wore an ever-changing array of cool and trendy outfits that the little girls could admire and copy, and who celebrated the fun and strength of being a modern girl.' This not only extended the market for record sales, but created a major boost for clothing, accessories and make-up companies which began to market directly and aggressively to the pre-teens. 'We opened Claire's Accessories in the UK five years ago,' says Karen Brooks, 'and there's no doubt that the timing was perfect.' Claire's sells make-up, jewellery, stationery and accessories, all priced as pocket-money purchases, so the little girls can shop autonomously, without parents. 'It's like a girlie grotto,' says Brooks. 'It's a shop designed for the girls themselves, not somewhere where you have to go with your parents.' At the moment, the younger girls are mad for karma beads and bowling bags. 'General fashion trends are important, but they're also incredibly influenced by pop and TV stars, and frankly they just aren't the same as they were in my day!' says Brooks, who is 38. 'We had Val Singleton on Blue Peter , and while we may have loved her, we didn't exactly aspire to look like her, did we? Today's tweenagers have Kat Dealy and a host of young, trendy role models to emulate.' Cassie More is brand director at Tammy, the market-leading fashion store for nine- to 15-year-old girls. That translates to mini-versions of whatever clothes are in fashion for teenagers and adults - nine-year-olds can buy sportswear like All Saints, tight fitting, strappy tops and dresses like Posh Spice's and endless permutations on whatever Britney is wearing. The St Tropez trend currently in vogue at the high end of the fashion market has filtered down to Tammy in the form of catsuits covered in sequins, predicted to be huge for Christmas party wear. 'Young girls are more influenced by role models and street fashion than women,' says More, 'and trends come and go faster. When Oasis appeared on Top of the Pops doing 'Wonderwall' wearing khaki, we sold out of khaki in all our shops the following Saturday. We had a similar experience with All Saints and the little strappy T-shirts.' Little girls love Tammy, but their parents don't always feel the same way. 'I do get odd letters of complaint,' admits More. 'I've had parents say that the clothes are indecent for children. We think we're being responsible in our designs and buying and we don't want to turn parents off, but we're a shop for the girls, not for their mums and dads.' She believes that there is no fundamental difference between today's tweenies and our own pre-teen years. 'If there had been a version of Tammy when I was a little girl I would have loved it. Children haven't really changed - we've just acknowledged them as a group and started to give them what they really want. For our shoppers, dressing in fashionable clothes is about fitting in with their peers, and about trying out their new identity as teenagers in a way that's safe and girly and fun. They want to look trendy, not sexy. Adults have always worried about the next generation being more sophisticated and advanced than they were, that's all.' Rachel Bowlby is the author of the upcoming Carried Away: The Invention of Modern Supermarkets. She agrees that tweenies are just another step along the path of consumer culture, just as we were and just as our parents were before us. We worry about their advanced materialism, but she points out that children have been acknowledged and targeted as important consumers in their own right since the period between the wars. She quotes from a sweetshop manual published in 1939: 'There are few better shoppers than children, who are always on the lookout for something new, and want good value for money.' Cinemas, she says, were producing special displays of new chocolate bars in their foyers whenever there was a children's film showing as early as the 40s. 'All that's changed is that the market has become more mature, and manufacturers are exploiting every niche even further,' she says, 'but there's no evidence of any real qualitative difference between today's tweenagers and their parents with their Jackie magazines. That was ostensibly aimed as 16-year-olds and bought by 11-year-olds, just as 12-year-olds buy magazines like J17 or 19 today.' Tweenies are different, but they're also the same. They have evolved in a world of mass media, technological innovation, social change and affluence. No amount of anxiety or concerned parenting can turn the clock back on that. We can't protect them from the adult world of violence, relationships, consumerism or anxiety. We have to stop wringing our hands about the end of childhood and develop new strategies to defend their rights as consumers and human beings, and to teach them filters for the blizzards of information, advertising and marketing which are their daily landscapes. In Sweden, there is a ban on advertising to under-12s. It hopes to use its presidency of the EU next year to extend that ban to the rest of Europe, including the UK, where the advertising of toys alone amounted to \u00a3182m in the past 12 months. In a media age, we need new blueprints for parenting, education and childcare. While tweenagers may be more exposed to adult realities and responsibilities, they are also better educated, more confident and ambitious and more listened to than any previous generation. They ask more questions, challenge more assumptions and don't blindly accept any authority. Anyone personally involved with children of this age can't fail to have noticed their sense of morality and justice, and of their concern for political issues, such as the environment and homelessness. While we fret that they don't 'play' like children anymore, we conveniently forget that notions of an ideal childhood are very modern, and that previous generations of children went down mines, up chimneys and to war. Today's eight- to 12-year-olds are living a far more 'ideal' life than their predecessors. I have two tweenies of my own and, through them, contact with lots more. In spite of the speed and complexity of their lives, and the variety of their backgrounds and personalities, they share the outstanding characteristics of their age: open minds, optimism and faith in themselves and the future. They are remarkably innocent, not in a sentimental sense - they can be aggressive, rude, greedy, even cruel - but in their freedom from cynicism and guile. Tweenies are boomers' babies, the children of a prolonged period of peace and prosperity. We don't know yet how they will turn out, what kind of world they will create for themselves when they become adults, but there's at least as much reason for optimism as anxiety.",

      "body": "<p>I live with a little girl, my daughter, who is several little girls. Sometimes, there seem so 'many' of her, I feel that I have undergone fertility treatment and produced the world's first multiple birth, where a perfect set of triplets (quadruplets?), have arrived rolled up into one person - like different colours of squashed-together Plasticine. The confusion does not end there. In real terms, the terms of the world, she is aged eight, but that is not her only age. Depending on how she is feeling and thinking at the time, she can pull off any age, from a vulnerable, snuggly two, right through to a flint-eyed, independent 15. And I stand in the middle of all this - this exotic, bewildering, very-modern mess - and think: where did I go right? </p> <p>Being an eight-year-old female was different in my day. In that it was the same - the same for everyone, the same as it had been for your older siblings, the same (almost) as it had been for your own mother (especially, if, like my mother, she gave birth in her teens). You wore dresses your mum picked; you wore your hair in bunches, and had your fringe (wonkily) cut with nail scissors; you went to Brownies; you loved pop (music and fizzy drink); you read Enid Blyton, CS Lewis, fairy tales, Jinty and The Beano , though occasionally you'd hit the hard stuff, sneaking a peek at your sister's Jackie . You knew about periods, but you couldn't (yuk!) see what they had to do with you. That, for the longest time, was life aged eight for most of us - all mud pies, comics, scabby knees and spelling tests. Innocence and denial. </p> <p>Now, with the dawning of the new tweenie age, everything is so different that it almost seems a shock when it's the same. Before, 'teenage' (12 to 19) was the big dividing line between childhood and adulthood, the point where you stopped taking the stability of the world for granted and let life, and all its hormonal rabbit-punches, get the better of you. I felt at the time that I was 'misunderstood', but, as it turns out, this was all a terrible misunderstanding, not to mention an age-old conceit. While most of us feel as painfully original as an open wound during these years, truth is, adolescence is awfully old hat. All parents, indeed all adults, have 'been there'. Tweenage is different - Year 2K children (children like my daughter) - are on virgin turf. 'Somewhere', a psycho-sociological space, nobody else has ever been. </p> <p>While teenage could be interpreted as one door closing and another opening, with tweenies, it's as if several doors are opening and closing at the same time. Certainly, there are times when our home seems 'crowded' with my daughter and her different personalities, multi-aged needs and desires. The two- year-old wants hugs and baby talk; the eight-year-old wants 'tattoos' and Girl Talk; the 12-year-old wants the clothes Buffy wears and micro-scooters to whizz to school on. The 15-year-old wants her ears pierced. Yesterday. </p> <p>She also wants the bedroom door firmly shut when her friends come around. No self-respecting tweenie-gal wants a parent around, when they're gossiping and bonding. It's a Key Stage 2 privacy thing. Nor would it make much difference if you were in the room with them. Tweenie- UK is another country, so it stands to reas- on that they should speak their own emotional-social-commercial language. </p> <p>That 'commercial' thing is a moot point. Maybe people read about all those eight to 12s laying waste to shopping centres and their parents' wallets and think to themselves: 'Spoiled little brats.' And, yes, they probably are. Not to mention ruthless. Boys and girls alike, tweenies have the shopping gene, the splashing-out bug, like no other ankle-biter generation before them. They might not have heard of Viv Nicholson, but they know how to 'spend, spend, spend'. Certainly, I have learned from hard experience that trying to deter a gang of eight-year-olds from virtually ram-raiding shops such as New Look and Claire's Accessories is a bit like coughing politely and calling for calm from the side of the chariot race in Ben Hur . </p> <p>Trouble is, I find it all rather harmless and amusing. To me, there are few things funnier than my daughter's hot little face, staring hungrily at shelves of tinsel bracelets, flicking through clothes racks with the practised ease of a Hollywood starlet, or munching away in Pizza Hut with her mates, all of them exuding the jaded \u00e9lan of restaurant critics. </p> <p>Tweenies know all about money and the 'good stuff' it can do. Their indefatigable efforts to get into your purse are at once horrific and irritating, and hilarious to behold. Maybe this attitude makes me a bad mother, but it doesn't make my daughter a bad child, or indeed a bad tweenie. Contrary to popular belief, tweenies don't always get what they want. They just know what they want. There's a difference. </p> <p>The biological side of tweeniedom - early menarche, blossoming curves - may be something my daughter has to come. Occasionally, she'll ask about periods, 'boobies', and what will happen when she becomes a 'big woman', but for the main part the future is not as interesting as today or, at a push, tomorrow. Right now, the adolescent side of her nature seems mainly confined to theatrical sulks. It is difficult dealing with an adolescent in full mood swing, even trickier when they happen to be eight. The dichotomy seems to lie in her continuing need for security, and her occasional desire to strike out on her own and get as far away from me as possible. </p> <p>While, as a child, I would quake when my parents told me about 'all the bad people out there', my daughter rolls her eyes. Her position is clear: the bogeyman isn't her problem, 'he's' mine. She fears nothing, except maybe spiders and being given a naff haircut. </p> <p>This can lead to tension. One day, my daughter might produce a memoir: Single Mommie Dearest . My mouth must form the word 'No' in my sleep these days. No, you can't walk to school alone. No, you can't watch cartoons until midnight. No, you can't wander off in a busy shopping precinct and 'catch me later'. </p> <p>A wise man once said that we shouldn't let our children know how much we love them because it would scare them. If you ask me, we might be equally at risk of boring them. Part of the tweenie-parent deal seems to be being totally taken for granted, with a little sarcastic twist in the tail. 'Do you love me, baby?'.'I don't hate you, Mummy.' This delivered, with a cheeky wink at her best boyfriend, the pair of them almost disappearing under the rubble of tweenie gear - rucksacks, Pokeballs and Gameboys - that makes their lives worth living. </p> <p>Otherwise, life with a tweenie is something of a moveable feast. A typical day with my daughter is distinguished by the fact that there's nothing remotely typical about it. Typical is banned in our house. Typical is 'pants'. When I wake up in the morning, the only certainties I have in life are Coco Pops and arguments. Or should I say 'intense debates' - mainly concerning how her hair should look. Plaits, I say, to safeguard against nits, and receive a martyred 'Muuum' glare. She wants Britney-bunches, at the very least, she wants to look her 'best'. What little girl ever didn't? However, there's an informed zeitgeist-linked element, a certain sophistication to my daughter's arguments that I don't remember having when I was her age. </p> <p>Within a three-minute conversation about how to do her hair, she can bring up anything from S Club 7, meningitis jabs and Harry Potter, to bunny rubbers, floods and the relative superiority of DVD to satellite and cable. Sometimes, listening to her rattle on nine to the dozen, it feels like I have a current-affairs prodigy, a pint-sized iconoclast, on my hands - that I'm brushing Jeremy Paxman's hair, transforming Malcolm Muggeridge into Britney Spears. However, from what I can see, this is normal for the tweenie generation. The majority of my daughter's friends are razor-sharp little motormouths, with their little pink fingers jammed against the pulse of the nation. The bits that interest them anyway. Could this in part explain parental unease at the tweenie phenomenon? That they all seem so much cleverer than us. </p> <p>And, crucially, happier, more together, more at ease. As we all know, adolescence, in its classic form, is one of those 'rainbow' experiences - you can be standing right in the middle of the mist and still not know you are in it. It's only when you stand back, get a little 'distance', that you finally recognise it for what it is. With tweenies, it's the same, only this time it seems to be the parents who need to stand back. Nothing sinister is happening when your child can use the internet better than you can; nothing appalling is going down when he or she has a firm opinion on how they want to be dressed. Just because their childhood isn't turning out precisely how you envisaged, the NSPCC don't have to called in just yet. </p> <p>When I look at my daughter cavorting about shops with her friends, I can see that she is 'playing' in the same way that I once played in makeshift dens with my own friends. Give tweenies a makeshift den and they'd play in that, too. Indeed, give any child anything (their homework?) to do, and it seems they'll find some way to play, whether you want them to or not. The only real difference these days seems to be that there is more choice, more ways to play. Even when my daughter is indulging in the most tweenie of pursuits - say, leafing through her beloved magazines, trying on new clothes, or ranting 'I like that!' at television commercials - the vulnerable child is always there. Could I pull the curtain across, she doesn't want people to see her 'body'. Is she as pretty as that little girl? Do I still love her more than anyone else in the world? </p> <p>That's the bottom line with tweenies. They are children first and children last, and only tweenies inbetween. When my daughter wants to be held and kissed, she wants to be held and kissed like a child, warmly, without subtext, not tentatively, like some nervous parent might approach a moody teenager. It is still important to her to have her school-work admired. Still vital that I kiss her goodnight. Still integral to her self-esteem that I erupt with pride whenever a new drawing appears. So it is, so it has always been. When people speak of 'tweenies' it is usually in terms of 'lost childhood', but that seems slightly hysterical. Going by my experiences with my daughter, it seems to be more a case of childhood rearranged. Just as you think tweeniedom has triumphed and the child is gone forever, never to return, up they pop again, like a forgotten firework. *</p>",

Could I pull the curtain across, she doesn't want people to see her 'body'. Is she as pretty as that little girl? Do I still love her more than anyone else in the world? That's the bottom line with tweenies. They are children first and children last, and only tweenies inbetween. When my daughter wants to be held and kissed, she wants to be held and kissed like a child, warmly, without subtext, not tentatively, like some nervous parent might approach a moody teenager. It is still important to her to have her school-work admired. Still vital that I kiss her goodnight. Still integral to her self-esteem that I erupt with pride whenever a new drawing appears. So it is, so it has always been. When people speak of 'tweenies' it is usually in terms of 'lost childhood', but that seems slightly hysterical. Going by my experiences with my daughter, it seems to be more a case of childhood rearranged. Just as you think tweeniedom has triumphed and the child is gone forever, never to return, up they pop again, like a forgotten firework. *",

      "body": "<p>When I first started thinking about, on the one hand, our national obsession with dumbing down and, on the other, our fascination with Who Wants to be a Millionaire?, I found myself in a pub called the Shakespeare, of all things. Millionaire is a vast national and international success. Yet such is our pandemic of stupidity, it seems, that 'young people of today' have so little general knowledge that they've no idea what 1066 signifies, let alone 'and all that' [1 - the answers to that, and to the remaining nine questions, are at the end.]</p> <p>I was drinking with a friend, the headmaster of a beacon school - the stars of the campaign against national ignorance. It was the start of half-term and he was telling me how he'd spent the day redecorating. I found my attention wandering.</p> <p>By various detours, my mind made its way back to how I'd spent the afternoon - playing Who Wants to be a Millionaire? on my eight-year-old's PlayStation. Together, we won \u00a31m, successfully answering questions like: what does IQ stand for? [2] 'Dad,' he said, 'wouldn't it be brilliant if the money came out of the side of the machine?'</p> <p>The headmaster interrupted my memories. 'Niamey,' he said. 'What?' I said. 'What's it the capital of?' he said. [3]</p> <p>A little confused, I looked around and saw what he was on about. The Shakespeare was having its first-ever pub quiz night. All around the bar, drinkers pondered and argued. There was nobody really young, of course. Our licensing laws ensure that. But there were plenty in the supposedly thicko 'young people of today' category. They tried to figure out which country has MCN on its licence plate [4] and who had a hit with 'England Swings' [5].</p> <p>The breadth, depth and width of knowledge displayed was fabulous.

      "bodyText": "When I first started thinking about, on the one hand, our national obsession with dumbing down and, on the other, our fascination with Who Wants to be a Millionaire?, I found myself in a pub called the Shakespeare, of all things. Millionaire is a vast national and international success. Yet such is our pandemic of stupidity, it seems, that 'young people of today' have so little general knowledge that they've no idea what 1066 signifies, let alone 'and all that' [1 - the answers to that, and to the remaining nine questions, are at the end.] I was drinking with a friend, the headmaster of a beacon school - the stars of the campaign against national ignorance. It was the start of half-term and he was telling me how he'd spent the day redecorating. I found my attention wandering. By various detours, my mind made its way back to how I'd spent the afternoon - playing Who Wants to be a Millionaire? on my eight-year-old's PlayStation. Together, we won \u00a31m, successfully answering questions like: what does IQ stand for? [2] 'Dad,' he said, 'wouldn't it be brilliant if the money came out of the side of the machine?' The headmaster interrupted my memories. 'Niamey,' he said. 'What?' I said. 'What's it the capital of?' he said. [3] A little confused, I looked around and saw what he was on about. The Shakespeare was having its first-ever pub quiz night. All around the bar, drinkers pondered and argued. There was nobody really young, of course. Our licensing laws ensure that. But there were plenty in the supposedly thicko 'young people of today' category. They tried to figure out which country has MCN on its licence plate [4] and who had a hit with 'England Swings' [5]. The breadth, depth and width of knowledge displayed was fabulous. In a close contest, the winners only pulled ahead by knowing such things as the brand name of silicon carbide [6] and the country of which Yaound\u00e9 is the capital [7]. Where, I wondered, does that leave our national dumbing down? Or Camilla's cousin becoming something of a hero for winning the Millionaire million? Or the fact that Millionaire was last Christmas's hit board game and is this year's hit computer game? I asked the headmaster what he thought. 'That's a very political question at the moment,' he said. 'The Conservatives say that children need to know facts like what 1066 means.

The legendary outfielder is the man Bush usually names as his childhood hero, though he has also mentioned Winston Churchill. And if this self-proclaimed 'baseball nut' is finally named president, he will owe it in large part to his favourite game.</p> <p>Bush was born to baseball as he was to so much else. His grandfather had batted fourth in the 1917 Yale baseball team, and his father, the future President Bush, captained Yale's championship winning side, played in the 1947 College World Series, and was once even approached by a scout.</p> <p>In baseball as in so many other spheres, the younger Bush lacked his father's talent. His mother Barbara remembers him as 'the most enthusiastic player', while his father wrote that 'Georgie' is 'so eager. He tries very hard.' George W himself says his happiest memory is playing catcher in little-league coached by his father in Midland, Texas.</p> <p>He was a better fan than player. Even today he can name the 1954 New York Giants starting line-up by heart, writes one of his biographers, JH Hatfield. In his youth he sent SAEs to baseball stars asking for their autographs, went with his father to watch the Houston Astros, and to the New York Mets with his great-uncle Herbert Walker, one of the team's original owners. Owning a baseball team was perhaps Bush's first realistic career goal.</p> <p>As a freshman at Yale, he pitched for the baseball team. Later he would recall the day the team's manager took one look at him warming up in the bullpen and told the second baseman to pitch instead. 'And that was the end of my career.'</p> <p>Instead he made his main mark on Yale sports as a fan. After the college's American football team - of which he was elected 'chief cheerleader', though he never mentioned this in later political campaigns in macho Texas - won a match at Princeton, he and some fellow students decided to celebrate by removing the Princeton goalposts. They were arrested by campus police but released minutes later. Bush now classifies this with all his other youthful misdemeanours under the rubric 'young and irresponsible'.</p> <p>After college he turned to golf. At Midland Country Club in the Seventies a prize for worst-dressed golfer was awarded in his honour, reports Hatfield. But baseball was to be key to Bush's political career. At the end of the Eighties, he was nothing but his father's son. He had achieved mediocre grades throughout an exclusive education, had drunk heavily, avoided service in Vietnam by jumping a queue for the Texas National Guard, failed to get elected to Congress, run loss-making oil companies, and worked for his father's presidential election campaign. As he admitted in 1989: 'You know I could run for governor [of Texas] but I'm basically a media creation. I've never done anything.'</p> <p>This would change. A right-wing millionaire named Eddie Childs was trying to sell his baseball team, the mediocre Texas Rangers. Bush, who had little money of his own, tried to put together a consortium of buyers. Peter Ueberroth, then commissioner of baseball, who happened to be friends with the elder Bush, lent a hand. A group of 70 investors was assembled to pay $83 million for the club.

The Rangers were then playing in a former minor-league park in Arlington. The Bush group wanted a bigger stadium. Strangely for a phalanx of right-wing millionaires, they decided that local taxpayers should finance it otherwise, it was threatened, the Rangers might move elsewhere.

The 13 acres where the Rangers wanted to build the stadium belonged to the heirs of Curtis Mathes, a television magnate. They demanded $2.8m for the land.

The Bush consortium said that should be paid not by the Rangers but, in effect, by the people of Arlington. Having condemned the private property of the Mathes family, Bush later ran for governor of Texas on a platform of 'private property'.</p> <p>The Rangers years set Bush up for politics.

But vast banks of information on every member of the public can quickly slip into the world of Big Brother. I will be asking serious questions about this.' Maurice Frankel, a leading campaigner on per sonal data issues, called the powers 'sweeping' and a cause for worry.</p> <p>The document, which is classified 'restricted', says new laws are needed to allow the intelligence services, Customs and Excise and the police access to telephone and computer records of every member of the public.</p> <p>It suggests that the Home Office is sympathetic to the new powers, which would be used to tackle the growing problems of cybercrime, the use of computers by paedophiles to run child pornography rings, as well as terrorism and international drug trafficking.</p> <p>Every telephone call made and received by a member of the public, all emails sent and received and every web page looked at would be recorded.</p> <p>Calls made on mobile phones can already be pinpointed geographically, as can those made from land lines. The police would be able to use 'trawling' computer techniques to look through millions of telephone and email records. Campaigners say innocent people could have such highly personal information accessed.</p> <p>The document admits the moves are controversial and could clash with the Human Rights Act, which gives people a right to privacy, European Union law and the Data Protection Act, which protects the public against official intrusion into private lives.</p> <p>The office of the Data Protection Commissioner, Elizabeth France, has already expressed 'grave concerns' .</p> <p>'A clear legislative framework needs to be agreed as a matter of urgency,' says the document, which is dated 10 August and is thought to have been sent to Home Office Minister Charles Clarke.</p> <p>'Why should data be retained? In the interests of justice, to preserve and protect data for use as evidence to establish proof of innocence or guilt. For intelligence and evidence gathering purposes, to maintain the effectiveness of UK law enforcement, intelligence and security agencies to protect society.'</p> <p>The document is written by Roger Gaspar, the deputy director-general of the National Criminal Intelligence Service, the Government agency that oversees criminal intelligence in the United Kingdom.

      "bodyText": "Britain's intelligence services are seeking powers to seize all records of telephone calls, emails and internet connections made by every person living in this country. A document circulated to Home Office officials and obtained by The Observer reveals that MI5, MI6 and the police are demanding new legislation to log every phone call made in this country and store the information for seven years at a vast government-run 'data warehouse', a super computer that will hold the information. The secret moves, which will cost millions of pounds, were last night condemned by politicians and campaigners as a sinister expansion of 'Big Brother' state powers and a fundamental attack on the public's right to privacy. Last night, the Home Office admitted that it was giving the plans serious consideration. Lord Cope, the Conservative peer and a leading expert on privacy issues, said: 'We are sympathetic to the need for greater powers to fight modern types of crime. But vast banks of information on every member of the public can quickly slip into the world of Big Brother. I will be asking serious questions about this.' Maurice Frankel, a leading campaigner on per sonal data issues, called the powers 'sweeping' and a cause for worry. The document, which is classified 'restricted', says new laws are needed to allow the intelligence services, Customs and Excise and the police access to telephone and computer records of every member of the public. It suggests that the Home Office is sympathetic to the new powers, which would be used to tackle the growing problems of cybercrime, the use of computers by paedophiles to run child pornography rings, as well as terrorism and international drug trafficking. Every telephone call made and received by a member of the public, all emails sent and received and every web page looked at would be recorded. Calls made on mobile phones can already be pinpointed geographically, as can those made from land lines. The police would be able to use 'trawling' computer techniques to look through millions of telephone and email records. Campaigners say innocent people could have such highly personal information accessed. The document admits the moves are controversial and could clash with the Human Rights Act, which gives people a right to privacy, European Union law and the Data Protection Act, which protects the public against official intrusion into private lives. The office of the Data Protection Commissioner, Elizabeth France, has already expressed 'grave concerns' . 'A clear legislative framework needs to be agreed as a matter of urgency,' says the document, which is dated 10 August and is thought to have been sent to Home Office Minister Charles Clarke. 'Why should data be retained? In the interests of justice, to preserve and protect data for use as evidence to establish proof of innocence or guilt. For intelligence and evidence gathering purposes, to maintain the effectiveness of UK law enforcement, intelligence and security agencies to protect society.' The document is written by Roger Gaspar, the deputy director-general of the National Criminal Intelligence Service, the Government agency that oversees criminal intelligence in the United Kingdom. Gaspar, as head of intelligence for NCIS, is one of the most powerful and influential men in the field. The report says it is written 'on behalf of Acpo [the Association of Chief Police Officers], HM Customs and Excise, security service, secret intelligence service and GCHQ [the Government's secret listening centre based at Cheltenham]'. Gaspar argues telephone companies should be ordered to retain all records of phone calls and internet access. At the moment many telephone and internet service providers keep data for as little as 24 hours. 'In the interests of verifying the accuracy of data specifically provided for either intelligence or evidential purposes, CSPs [communication service providers such as telephone or internet companies] should be under an obligation to retain the original data supplied for a period of seven years or for as long as the prosecuting authority directs,' the document says. 'Informal discussions have taken place with the office of the data protection commissioner. Whilst they acknowledge that such communications data may be of value to the work of the agencies and the interests of justice they have grave reservations about longer term data retention.' The document says the new data warehouse would be run along similar lines to the National DNA Database for profiles of known criminals. It would cost about \u00a33 million to set up and \u00a39m a year to run. The report demands that the Government 'should be prepared to defend our position'. A spokesman for NCIS refused to be drawn on the report. 'I am not going to comment on a classified document that is in unauthorised hands,' he said. Meanwhile a Home Office spokesman said it had received the proposals and was considering them.",

In the middle of the longest economic upturn in recent history, Britain's employees will not be reaping the benefits this Christmas. </p> <p>More than 150 years after Charles Dickens created Ebenezer Scrooge, one in three workplaces will give nothing at all to employees to mark the festive season.

'The trend of reducing Christmas benefits, which we first identified five years ago, has now become the norm,' said researcher Clare Ruhemann.

Only 10 per cent of Britain's 29.5 million workers will get a Christmas bonus, and just three per cent some time off for shopping. Many companies allow half a day off for shopping or an early finish on Christmas Eve, researchers discovered, but now require staff to make up the time in the New Year. </p> <p>The worst business to work in if you look forward to Christmas is the transport industry, depressing enough at the best of times. At south-east-based Metrobus, staff report only getting a full Christmas bonus if they have had no time off sick during the year. At Arriva Shires drivers have gone 'from a \u00a310 voucher to a box of chocolates to nothing'. At Go Wear buses an employee complained of no Christmas bonus and said: 'Last year they even stopped printing Merry Christmas on the pay slips.' </p> <p>One in three firms to offer parties this month will charge staff for the event. At Dairy Crest staff will pay for lunch but as a gesture of festive generosity will be offered free orange juice. Biscuit manufacturer Jacobs will give staff free biscuits. </p> <p>The most common Christmas gifts for staff that still receive them are turkeys, wine, hampers or chocolate. </p> <p>Labour Research advises: 'If employees have been in receipt of a Christmas bonus for a substantial period, say a number of years, the bonus may be an implied contractual entitlement. If your employer tries to take this away you may be able to claim the bonus back through an industrial tribunal.' But even for lucky staff, the Inland Revenue now insists that all Christmas gifts are liable for tax. You should declare a turkey if you receive one. </p> <p>While pay and benefits are being squeezed for staff, Britain's bosses will celebrate a bumper year this Christmas. The most recent survey of company directors, by Incomes Data Services, found that basic salaries have risen 10.1 per cent during the past 12 months. With bonuses included the total was 14 per cent. The average pay package for a FT-SE 100 chief executive is now \u00a3884,445. </p> <p>Judith Doyle, cultural trends analyst at the Industrial Society, said: 'If you're in a tight labour market, a show of generosity really does affect staff sentiment towards their companies. There's no point offering flexible working and other things to make staff stay loyal if at the end of the year you behave like this. People will accept prudence when there's a recession but they expect some generosity when firms are making money hand over fist.' </p> <p>A spokeswoman for the CBI, Britain's biggest employers organisation, said: 'It really is down to individual companies.

      "bodyText": "The Irish notion of nationhood appears to be elastic, as new figures show that record numbers are applying for British passports in the Republic. The British Embassy in Dublin has revealed that by the end of this year it will have issued up to 7,500 new passports to people south of the border. Embassy officials are also dealing with up to 70,000 renewals of old British passports every year. The numbers seeking British passports in Dublin this year represent a jump of more than 50 per cent compared with 1996, when 4,701 applied. Peter Hain, the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, released the figures in response to a parliamentary question last week from John Taylor, the deputy Ulster Unionist leader. Hain said there were reliable estimates of the total number of British passport holders resident in the Republic of Ireland. But given the annual increase in issuing the passport, at a bare minimum at least 75,000 Irish citizens hold UK passports in the Republic. The figure, however, could be as high as a quarter of a million. Taylor said the increase in people from the Republic preferring to travel abroad on British passports was confirmation of the improving relations between Britain and Ireland. 'I welcome this trend and I trust this message is clearly understood by nationalists and republicans in Northern Ireland.' The Strangford MP added that this trend should convince many in the Republic that, like post-apartheid South Africa, Ireland should rejoin the Commonwealth, given that so many of its citizens identified with Britain. He also welcomed discussions between the two governments on co-operation between Irish and British troops in the EU's Rapid Reaction Force. Eamon O'Cuiv, the junior Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, described the upsurge in demand for British passports as simply a 'matter of convenience, as they are all EU passports'. O'Cuiv, grandson of Eamon de Valera who called for Ireland to rejoin the Commonwealth, added: 'Despite the increase I feel that it does not take away from the desire of the vast majority of the people of Ireland for independence within the brotherhood of the European Union.' The revelation comes as Ulster Unionists are exerting more pressure on the Republic to apply reforms entailed in the Good Friday Agreement. Lord Laird, the UUP peer who has championed the cause of Ulster Scots in the Republic, called in the Lords last week for the Dublin government to adopt human rights and anti-discrimination legislation contained in the agreement. During a debate on the Disqualification Bill last Thursday, which enables Irish TDs and senators the right to sit in the Northern Ireland Assembly, Laird challenged the British Government to support his demand for all reforms under the agreement to apply on both sides of the border. Laird won the backing of the Labour peer, Lord Dubs.",

      "body": "<p>A high-profile group of artists, politicians, commentators and curators has launched an attack on the Government for its patronising 'control freakery' in the arts.</p> <p>While lottery cash may have boosted the funding of theatre, music and visual arts, the group alleges New Labour now regards the arts as a tool for social engineering.</p> <p>The critics, who include Baroness Warnock, the Oxbridge philosopher, Arthur Scargill, former leader of the National Union of Mine Workers, Antony Gormley, the sculptor of The Angel of the North , and the Turner Prize-nominated artist Mark Wallinger, are all contributors to a book called Arts For All , which is published in 10 days' time.</p> <p>Among the most trenchant views expressed are those of Scargill, who pinpoints a 'frequent misconception that working people, men and women, do not appreciate art.' His words are echoed throughout the book as more than 30 contributing pundits and practitioners urge the Government to step back and give British artists more control of their own work.</p> <p>They argue that the Secretary of State for Culture, Chris Smith, is too concerned with the economic value of the 'creative community' and that lottery applications have placed too much emphasis on the social benefits of art and on educational work that should have been funded by other government departments. They believe the arts should be championed for their own sake and not have to fulfil irrelevant funding requirements.</p> <p>During a public discussion at the Royal Society of Arts that heralded the publication of the book by the Peer Group, Alan Howarth, the Minister for the Arts, was accused of neo-Stalinism by the writer and fellow panelist Andrew Brighton, a curator at Tate Britain. 'New Labour wants to create art with mass appeal that caters to a kind of Everyman,' said Brighton, who went on to point out that art does not have to appeal to everyone and does not even always create good things. It has always been capable, for example, of expressing both racist and sexist thought. Warnock asked whether the Government actually believed art was about creating the good citizen.</p> <p>Howarth defended the policies of his department by saying that efforts to control funding were designed to improve management efficiency. He said snobbery in the arts was a terrible thing and his department was working to develop 'due steward ship' and better ways of evaluating good arts organisations.</p> <p>The fiery debate will be broadcast on Radio Three on 14 December to mark the launch of the eclectic book.</p> <p>In its pages Scargill says the arts already belonged to everyone who wanted them, well before New Labour decided to promote the idea of popular access. He argues, too, that real creativity is about subverting and challenging authority. 'You will see the connection between art and culture and writing and the struggle of working men and women for true emancipation,' he writes.</p> <p>In a piece called The Two Faces of Chris Smith , the academic John Pick, of City University, argues that New Labour arts policy has been heavily influenced by Australia. He claims that crucial contact with the populist attitudes of Rupert Murdoch and with former Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating, and his emphasis on what the creative industries might do for a national economy, have permanently damaged Tony Blair's attitude to the arts.</p> <p>'The practice of putting an economic value, and nothing else, upon heritage and the arts was well established when Dr Smith assumed office,' writes Pick.</p> <p>The Canadian political philosopher Richard Noble writes: 'Should the arts be, as the Labour Party Manifesto puts it, \"central to the task of recreating the sense of community, identity and civic pride that should define our country\"?'</p> <p>The Arts Council lottery grant assessor Roland Miller complains that funding is wrongly decided on the basis of 'addressing social exclusion', which places an odd burden on the artist.</p> <p>The Department of Culture, Media and Sport, asked for permission to include a piece by Smith outlining his views on access and the arts, turned down the request and demanded that a long policy document be printed in full instead.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A high-profile group of artists, politicians, commentators and curators has launched an attack on the Government for its patronising 'control freakery' in the arts. While lottery cash may have boosted the funding of theatre, music and visual arts, the group alleges New Labour now regards the arts as a tool for social engineering. The critics, who include Baroness Warnock, the Oxbridge philosopher, Arthur Scargill, former leader of the National Union of Mine Workers, Antony Gormley, the sculptor of The Angel of the North , and the Turner Prize-nominated artist Mark Wallinger, are all contributors to a book called Arts For All , which is published in 10 days' time. Among the most trenchant views expressed are those of Scargill, who pinpoints a 'frequent misconception that working people, men and women, do not appreciate art.' His words are echoed throughout the book as more than 30 contributing pundits and practitioners urge the Government to step back and give British artists more control of their own work. They argue that the Secretary of State for Culture, Chris Smith, is too concerned with the economic value of the 'creative community' and that lottery applications have placed too much emphasis on the social benefits of art and on educational work that should have been funded by other government departments. They believe the arts should be championed for their own sake and not have to fulfil irrelevant funding requirements. During a public discussion at the Royal Society of Arts that heralded the publication of the book by the Peer Group, Alan Howarth, the Minister for the Arts, was accused of neo-Stalinism by the writer and fellow panelist Andrew Brighton, a curator at Tate Britain. 'New Labour wants to create art with mass appeal that caters to a kind of Everyman,' said Brighton, who went on to point out that art does not have to appeal to everyone and does not even always create good things. It has always been capable, for example, of expressing both racist and sexist thought. Warnock asked whether the Government actually believed art was about creating the good citizen. Howarth defended the policies of his department by saying that efforts to control funding were designed to improve management efficiency. He said snobbery in the arts was a terrible thing and his department was working to develop 'due steward ship' and better ways of evaluating good arts organisations. The fiery debate will be broadcast on Radio Three on 14 December to mark the launch of the eclectic book. In its pages Scargill says the arts already belonged to everyone who wanted them, well before New Labour decided to promote the idea of popular access. He argues, too, that real creativity is about subverting and challenging authority. 'You will see the connection between art and culture and writing and the struggle of working men and women for true emancipation,' he writes. In a piece called The Two Faces of Chris Smith , the academic John Pick, of City University, argues that New Labour arts policy has been heavily influenced by Australia. He claims that crucial contact with the populist attitudes of Rupert Murdoch and with former Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating, and his emphasis on what the creative industries might do for a national economy, have permanently damaged Tony Blair's attitude to the arts. 'The practice of putting an economic value, and nothing else, upon heritage and the arts was well established when Dr Smith assumed office,' writes Pick. The Canadian political philosopher Richard Noble writes: 'Should the arts be, as the Labour Party Manifesto puts it, \"central to the task of recreating the sense of community, identity and civic pride that should define our country\"?' The Arts Council lottery grant assessor Roland Miller complains that funding is wrongly decided on the basis of 'addressing social exclusion', which places an odd burden on the artist. The Department of Culture, Media and Sport, asked for permission to include a piece by Smith outlining his views on access and the arts, turned down the request and demanded that a long policy document be printed in full instead.",

      "body": "<p>As a teenage road-cleaner, Frank McAvennie struck nobody as a football star of the future. He did not play regularly, hated training and spent Saturdays on the terraces rather than honing his skills. His talent was noticed by chance when he appeared in a game where a posse of scouts had arrived to watch another player. Before long McAvennie had traded sweeping the streets for sweeping through some of the toughest defences in English and Scottish football.</p> <p>In the late 1980s he was one of Britain's most high-profile celebrities. McAvennie won medals, was adored by fans and earned \u00a35,000 a week - a fortune at the time - scoring regularly for West Ham and then Celtic. Off the pitch, the Scot was a regular fixture on the London party circuit. He drank only champagne, mixed with actors and pop stars at clubs such as Stringfellow's, and was rarely seen without a glamorous woman on his arm.</p> <p>But since hitting those heights, McAvennie has spiralled downwards in a drug-fuelled cycle of crime, scandal and reckless misbehaviour. The one-time idol is now penniless, unemployed and living in an untidy flat in Gates-head, Tyne and Wear. He recently risked a lengthy jail sentence over accusations that he was a drugs dealer.</p> <p>Now, after years of silence about his life and crimes, he has admitted to The Observer, in an exclusive interview, how his love of cocaine, association with criminals and chronic inability to keep out of trouble have ruined him. McAvennie hopes his candid confession of how he succumbed to the pitfalls of fame will act as a warning to today's generation of sports- car-driving, nightclub-going, millionaire footballers. He wants the stars of tomorrow to learn from his mistakes and stay away from drugs.</p> <p>'I've made mistakes, huge mistakes, and done a lot of stupid things with coke,' says McAvennie. 'I wish now I'd never tried drugs. Yes, I had fun when I was on them, but I had good fun when I was drunk too. Look at the trouble cocaine's got me into. It's not very funny being in court looking at doing a long sentence because I'm associated with drugs...'</p> <p>It has finally dawned on him that most people now link his name with cocaine and court appearances rather than the bagfuls of goals he scored during a 16-year career strewn with controversy with nine different clubs.</p> <p>That realisation has been painful. 'I want my four-year-old son to grow up and people say, \"Your dad's an ex-footballer\" and not, \"Your dad's a drug dealer\",' he says. 'At the moment he doesn't know why I'm in the papers. He just looks at pictures of me and says, \"Daddy!\". So the first time someone says to him \"Your dad's the ex-footballer\", I'll be well happy.'</p> <p>That may be a forlorn hope. McAvennie's admission in 1994 that he had begun snorting cocaine while still playing football shocked fans. Since then two convictions for possessing the drug, having \u00a3100,000 seized by Customs, who said it was going to fund a major drugs deal, and renewed accusations recently that he was involved in supplying drugs have underlined a fall from grace spectacular even by the standards of football 'bad boys' such as George Best, Paul Merson and Stan Collymore.</p> <p>McAvennie says that his lowest ebb came six weeks ago. He was on trial at Newcastle Crown Court charged with conspiracy to supply \u00a3110,000 worth of ecstasy tablets and amphetamines and facing up to 10 years in prison if convicted. After a month on remand in Durham jail with murderers and paedophiles, he is not sure he could have coped with having to spend any more time inside. Happily for him, the jury acquitted him, prompting him to break down in tears.</p> <p>He maintains there was never any evidence against him. The case presented in court was 'comical, a total nonsense', he says, ridiculing the idea that he would have got involved in handling a bag of drugs in broad daylight at the main entrance to Newcastle station, especially with his face, which still brings requests for autographs.</p> <p>The ex-player scorns the idea that he is a drugs dealer. Pointing up how he has fallen on hard time, he jokes: 'Pablo Escobar's a drugs baron and he's worth 300 billion, or something like that, but Frank Skint is a right good drugs baron, isn't he? Supplying drugs is wrong. I would never, ever sell drugs and I have never, ever sold drugs. I have bought drugs myself and I gave drugs away to somebody I knew. [But] I've never got them for other people, much less sold them.'</p> <p>Back in 1996, magistrates in Dover reached a decision which casts doubt on McAvennie's protestations of innocence. They ruled that \u00a3200,000 in cash found in a Land-Rover at the town's docks - half of which McAvennie had supplied - was going to be used to buy drugs in Holland and smuggle them into Britain. McAvennie had given three different accounts of where the money had come from, the court heard. Upholding the Customs action, chairman of the bench George Ruck said: 'We are satisfied that the money was intended for use in drugs trafficking.'</p> <p>Not everything McAvennie says makes total sense. He claims he was 'duped' out of the money by unscrupulous business associates and that he thought he was buying a boat to salvage valuables from a sunken treasure ship in the Atlantic. He blames 'bad legal representation' for the verdict and insists he could have appealed and got the money back, but did not do so because his mother suffered a heart attack at the time because of all the bad publicity her son was getting.</p> <p>One of the alleged co-conspirators in the Dover case was Allan Short, who at the time was the ex-player's business partner. Who is he? 'I didn't know him', claims McAvennie, before seconds later describing Short as 'a really nice guy'. He does not mention that, soon after the Dover case, his one-time partner was given two years in jail by a Belgian court for cocaine smuggling.</p> <p>McAvennie insists that it is simply his characteristic bad luck that the authorities have twice accused him of involvement in drug dealing. But he does accept that taking cocaine back in 1989, during his second spell at West Ham, was a disastrous turning-point.</p> <p>He first tried the white powder while out of action with a badly broken leg.

      "bodyText": "As a teenage road-cleaner, Frank McAvennie struck nobody as a football star of the future. He did not play regularly, hated training and spent Saturdays on the terraces rather than honing his skills. His talent was noticed by chance when he appeared in a game where a posse of scouts had arrived to watch another player. Before long McAvennie had traded sweeping the streets for sweeping through some of the toughest defences in English and Scottish football. In the late 1980s he was one of Britain's most high-profile celebrities. McAvennie won medals, was adored by fans and earned \u00a35,000 a week - a fortune at the time - scoring regularly for West Ham and then Celtic. Off the pitch, the Scot was a regular fixture on the London party circuit. He drank only champagne, mixed with actors and pop stars at clubs such as Stringfellow's, and was rarely seen without a glamorous woman on his arm. But since hitting those heights, McAvennie has spiralled downwards in a drug-fuelled cycle of crime, scandal and reckless misbehaviour. The one-time idol is now penniless, unemployed and living in an untidy flat in Gates-head, Tyne and Wear. He recently risked a lengthy jail sentence over accusations that he was a drugs dealer. Now, after years of silence about his life and crimes, he has admitted to The Observer, in an exclusive interview, how his love of cocaine, association with criminals and chronic inability to keep out of trouble have ruined him. McAvennie hopes his candid confession of how he succumbed to the pitfalls of fame will act as a warning to today's generation of sports- car-driving, nightclub-going, millionaire footballers. He wants the stars of tomorrow to learn from his mistakes and stay away from drugs. 'I've made mistakes, huge mistakes, and done a lot of stupid things with coke,' says McAvennie. 'I wish now I'd never tried drugs. Yes, I had fun when I was on them, but I had good fun when I was drunk too. Look at the trouble cocaine's got me into. It's not very funny being in court looking at doing a long sentence because I'm associated with drugs...' It has finally dawned on him that most people now link his name with cocaine and court appearances rather than the bagfuls of goals he scored during a 16-year career strewn with controversy with nine different clubs. That realisation has been painful. 'I want my four-year-old son to grow up and people say, \"Your dad's an ex-footballer\" and not, \"Your dad's a drug dealer\",' he says. 'At the moment he doesn't know why I'm in the papers. He just looks at pictures of me and says, \"Daddy!\". So the first time someone says to him \"Your dad's the ex-footballer\", I'll be well happy.' That may be a forlorn hope. McAvennie's admission in 1994 that he had begun snorting cocaine while still playing football shocked fans. Since then two convictions for possessing the drug, having \u00a3100,000 seized by Customs, who said it was going to fund a major drugs deal, and renewed accusations recently that he was involved in supplying drugs have underlined a fall from grace spectacular even by the standards of football 'bad boys' such as George Best, Paul Merson and Stan Collymore. McAvennie says that his lowest ebb came six weeks ago. He was on trial at Newcastle Crown Court charged with conspiracy to supply \u00a3110,000 worth of ecstasy tablets and amphetamines and facing up to 10 years in prison if convicted. After a month on remand in Durham jail with murderers and paedophiles, he is not sure he could have coped with having to spend any more time inside. Happily for him, the jury acquitted him, prompting him to break down in tears. He maintains there was never any evidence against him. The case presented in court was 'comical, a total nonsense', he says, ridiculing the idea that he would have got involved in handling a bag of drugs in broad daylight at the main entrance to Newcastle station, especially with his face, which still brings requests for autographs. The ex-player scorns the idea that he is a drugs dealer. Pointing up how he has fallen on hard time, he jokes: 'Pablo Escobar's a drugs baron and he's worth 300 billion, or something like that, but Frank Skint is a right good drugs baron, isn't he? Supplying drugs is wrong. I would never, ever sell drugs and I have never, ever sold drugs. I have bought drugs myself and I gave drugs away to somebody I knew. [But] I've never got them for other people, much less sold them.' Back in 1996, magistrates in Dover reached a decision which casts doubt on McAvennie's protestations of innocence. They ruled that \u00a3200,000 in cash found in a Land-Rover at the town's docks - half of which McAvennie had supplied - was going to be used to buy drugs in Holland and smuggle them into Britain. McAvennie had given three different accounts of where the money had come from, the court heard. Upholding the Customs action, chairman of the bench George Ruck said: 'We are satisfied that the money was intended for use in drugs trafficking.' Not everything McAvennie says makes total sense. He claims he was 'duped' out of the money by unscrupulous business associates and that he thought he was buying a boat to salvage valuables from a sunken treasure ship in the Atlantic. He blames 'bad legal representation' for the verdict and insists he could have appealed and got the money back, but did not do so because his mother suffered a heart attack at the time because of all the bad publicity her son was getting. One of the alleged co-conspirators in the Dover case was Allan Short, who at the time was the ex-player's business partner. Who is he? 'I didn't know him', claims McAvennie, before seconds later describing Short as 'a really nice guy'. He does not mention that, soon after the Dover case, his one-time partner was given two years in jail by a Belgian court for cocaine smuggling. McAvennie insists that it is simply his characteristic bad luck that the authorities have twice accused him of involvement in drug dealing. But he does accept that taking cocaine back in 1989, during his second spell at West Ham, was a disastrous turning-point. He first tried the white powder while out of action with a badly broken leg. 'I was in a club, I was drunk and somebody gave me it. To be honest, I probably wouldn't have taken it if I was playing. But I can't say that. I don't know. I was at such a low. I missed the buzz of the dressing room and the camaraderie of my team mates. I forgot the principles of everything.' Contradictions emerge as McAvennie talks. He initially states firmly that 'I didn't take drugs when I was playing', then minutes later admits he did continue his cocaine habit after returning to the first team. He is keen to stress coke 'wasn't a great problem for me, it wasn't a problem at all', then admits he was at risk of becoming addicted during what he calls 'a wild time after I'd retired from football. I went off the rails and took a hell of a lot of drink and I took drugs'. McAvennie is adamant that he has never become hooked on cocaine and was merely an occasional user. 'I didn't get addicted. It could have been six months before I had a line and then I might have taken half a dozen [in] one night... I'm not going to say I was an addict just to satisfy people and get sympathy off people.' Still sporting peroxide blond hair and a new blonde girlfriend - Karen, his fianc\u00e9e - McAvennie says the recent court case acted as a wake-up call, that he has quit cocaine for good and wants to make a fresh start in his life. Channel 4 is making a documentary about his life. He is halfway towards getting his coaching badge and wants to become a coach - but abroad, away from media scrutiny. Would he get a job back here, with his reputation? 'It'll take a wee bit of time for people to come round. But yes, once the stigma dies down. People in football know I'm not the maniac that people think.' He is also interested in going into clubs' youth academies and lecturing 16-year-olds on the pressures of fame and dangers of drugs. 'If I can help anyone that way, I will. All they have to do is look at me and what's happened in my life.' Last Sunday night brought a reminder of the glory days.

      "bodyText": "Victor Meldrew may be dead, but Britain's moaners will still have a role model to follow with the launch of a website dedicated to the art of complaining. The site, called www.complainer.co.uk, is aimed at overcoming the traditional British reluctance to protest about poor service and shoddy goods. It provides a step-by-step guide to drafting effective complaints and allows disgruntled consumers to email companies directly from the site. Key bits of advice include protesting immediately, cracking jokes and trying not to lose your temper. Among the more bizarre homilies given to outraged consumers is: 'A good complainer is a happy complainer.' The site is the brainchild of self-styled author and 'professional complainer' Jasper Griegson, whose books include The Complainer's Guide to Getting Even, The Joys of Complaining and The Complete Complainer . Griegson seems to take a bizarre joy in his work. 'I am a serial complainer,' he said. 'I see it as a cathartic experience. Without complaining, all these little tensions will just build up.' His mission is to make Britons change their ways. For example, most react to a bad restaurant by meekly paying their bill and not returning. In the United States, however, customers will complain on the spot and demand a discount. Griegson says Americans are not afraid of confrontation, whereas British people are brought up to accept things as they are and be polite. 'Though people are now becoming more like the US, they end up shouting and banging their fists at the people behind the counter, and that's not going to be effective,' he said. Instead, the website will allow complainers to contact senior executives at the biggest companies in Britain using email forms provided online. Already 1,000 firms have signed up to the site. The move has been backed by consumer groups, which predict a major change in British attitudes.

But things are changing. Consumers are becoming aware of their rights.' There may be a long way to go, however, before complaining becomes cool.

It's a motto that Brook might adopt. Ever since, garlanded for his Midsummer Night's Dream and King Lear , he left Britain for France, he's been playing through a fast: gambling on a style of theatre - stripped down in design, using an international cast - of which there's been a dearth in his native land. </p> <p>The Hamlet he's directed at the Bouffes du Nord is intense, often beautiful. It's no accident that it's billed as <strong> The Tragedy of Hamlet</strong>, 'adapted' by Brook. Hamlet can be wild, disturbing, witty, savage, but rarely has it been so inescapably sad. At times, it's as if the text, pared down and re-ordered, has been stunned; at times, it's stunning. </p> <p>Under its blackish, tarnished dome, the Bouffes du Nord is rose-coloured, its gilt faded. When Brook discovered the old vaudeville theatre, it had been abandoned for years, used as a shelter by homeless people, who burnt bits. He's left signs of its dilapidation: the columns at either side of the stage have the functional look of pipes. </p> <p>Chlo\u00e9 Obolensky's orientally unfussy design sits comfortably in this arena. The stage, which isn't divided from the audience by curtains, is spread with a red carpet and a few curtains - bright yellow, green and black. Toshi Tsuchitori's music is also from the East: it threads its way through the action like gusts of wind. The Ghost's appearances are accompanied by a dry rustle, as of chains made of seed pods, or a giant breath; Ophelia's madness is introduced by a repetitive sawing of strings. </p> <p>Brook will offend many by his changes: he has docked one of the most famous speeches in the English language - Polonius's advice to his son; he has switched the opening and closing sentences of the play, so that, amid universal carnage, Horatio sees first a dawn and then the hint of a suspicious supernatural presence. Fortinbras - never a charismatic presence but a figure who contributes to the tangle of ideas about fathers and sons - has been docked. </p> <p>What's left is a Hamlet of the heart: absolutely recognisable to anyone who's seen the play, but confusing to someone who comes to it fresh. Natasha Parry is a wonderful, intelligent Gertrude; Jeffrey Kisson is a stately Ghost and a repellently contained Claudius; Adrian Lester's prince is - as the production is - completely absorbing, but limitingly played on one sombre, meditative note. He is clever and entirely sane: his ferocious pantomimes of madness - rolling on the ground, spitting waves of saliva at Polonius - are insulting displays of superiority. </p> <p>It's hard to think of a more finger-on-the-theatrical-pulse combination than the talents involved with <strong> Far Away</strong>. The post- Billy Elliot Stephen Daldry returns to the stage to direct a political play by Caryl Churchill, who skewered the Thatcher era in Top Girls and Serious Money. Together they supply an example of a genre which the Royal Court has pioneered: tableau theatre, in which installation art is given motion and voice. </p> <p>Each of the three brief scenes (the entire occasion lasts only 50 minutes) is centred on a striking image and a biting statement. Each episode is forcefully punched home. Each point is worth making, and is sometimes brilliantly made. </p> <p>Anyone who's been lied to will recognise the slippery concealments of the first scene, in which a child (the chillingly calm Annabelle Seymour-Julen) prises from a grown-up the details of a massacre. Anyone who's recoiled at the sight of models draped across a deprived cityscape will be stirred by the sight of a throng, bound in chains and dressed in prison uniforms, wearing hats of a Philip Treacy-like glorious inventiveness. And anyone who remembers the weird moment when the speaking-clock shockingly changed its message, to proclaim that the time was 'sponsored' must acknowledge the cogency of the final scene, in which all animals and elements are coerced into taking sides; a wonderful poetic rush describes the potential nastiness of deer, with their 'vicious little shining hooves'. </p> <p>But there's a crucial absence. This is a piece about a world going to the dogs, about a recognisable, homely place becoming hostile and unbearable. But it doesn't argue the case, it states it: it doesn't develop, but jumps from one state to another. In the end, you don't believe it. Churchill has short-changed her most unusual gift: the capacity to convey the way terror and disorder creep up on you: the way you blink and think you've got something in your eye, and then it turns out that everything around you is deranged. </p> <p>The big Christmas show at Stratford, <strong> The Secret Garden</strong> is an antidote to panto: a sober, sweetly sung version of a haunting Victorian weepie in which everyone finds their right place. Under Adrian Noble's skilful direction, the heroine of Frances Hodgson Burnett's horticultural story, a little Raj sourpuss, is glimpsed being orphaned in India (figures in ochre gowns weave through smoke) and brought to Yorkshire (brass bedsteads and dimpled maidservants) where she's brought down a peg or two and finds a heart. </p> <p>The only thing the production lacks is the infusion of feeling which occurs when hearts and buds blossom together: the garden's flowering - when a tasteful bower of roses is lowered on to the grey panels traced with bare black branches - is too much like something you'd be pleased rather than disturbed to receive, like a dream bouquet from Moyses Stevens. The thing Marsha Norman and Lucy Simon's adaptation lacks is more fundamental: a sense of adventure. The servants may have better inclinations, manners and skin than those who order them about, but it's the poshies who get the ballads and romance; the underlings are left with oompah music and jollity.</p>",

And anyone who remembers the weird moment when the speaking-clock shockingly changed its message, to proclaim that the time was 'sponsored' must acknowledge the cogency of the final scene, in which all animals and elements are coerced into taking sides; a wonderful poetic rush describes the potential nastiness of deer, with their 'vicious little shining hooves'. But there's a crucial absence. This is a piece about a world going to the dogs, about a recognisable, homely place becoming hostile and unbearable. But it doesn't argue the case, it states it: it doesn't develop, but jumps from one state to another. In the end, you don't believe it. Churchill has short-changed her most unusual gift: the capacity to convey the way terror and disorder creep up on you: the way you blink and think you've got something in your eye, and then it turns out that everything around you is deranged. The big Christmas show at Stratford, The Secret Garden is an antidote to panto: a sober, sweetly sung version of a haunting Victorian weepie in which everyone finds their right place. Under Adrian Noble's skilful direction, the heroine of Frances Hodgson Burnett's horticultural story, a little Raj sourpuss, is glimpsed being orphaned in India (figures in ochre gowns weave through smoke) and brought to Yorkshire (brass bedsteads and dimpled maidservants) where she's brought down a peg or two and finds a heart. The only thing the production lacks is the infusion of feeling which occurs when hearts and buds blossom together: the garden's flowering - when a tasteful bower of roses is lowered on to the grey panels traced with bare black branches - is too much like something you'd be pleased rather than disturbed to receive, like a dream bouquet from Moyses Stevens. The thing Marsha Norman and Lucy Simon's adaptation lacks is more fundamental: a sense of adventure. The servants may have better inclinations, manners and skin than those who order them about, but it's the poshies who get the ballads and romance; the underlings are left with oompah music and jollity.",

      "body": "<p><strong> Madonna</strong> Brixton Academy, London SW9 </p> <p> 'I have a pet theory about Madonna,' says a mate a few hours before we're due to see the Queen of Pop perform. 'Every time she releases an album, women finish with their boyfriends. There's always one track on the LP that does it. With Music, it's \"What It Feels Like For A Girl\". Women wake up, put that on, and shazam! he's out.' </p> <p>The man who told me that is a recent dumpee, so his relationship doctrines should be taken with a sack-load of salt. Yet his claim falls on receptive ears. We consider it, and nod sagely. This is because for the past few months, we have all been witness to The Unique Powers Of Madonna: her witchy charms, her blast-all-before-thee charisma, her special magic. Quiver! as the prospect of winning tickets to her concert reduces grown-ups to blubbering wrecks live on national radio. Cower! as you realise that touts are selling said tickets for \u00a31,000 - each! Be very afraid! when you finally acknowledge that all the usual ligging methods - chatting up PRs, pulling in favours, even offering to pay for a sodding pass - are not going to work this time and you're going to have to watch the gig over the internet, all small and jerky... Or, of course, be very smug! because you've got a spare invite and you are the suddenly the most interesting and important of all your friends. Hee hee. Such is Madonna's current voodoo that you feel as though her ticket could spontaneously combust: you keep your hand in your pocket, to check that the precious paper is still there. This concert is the first she's given in Britain for seven years, the first since the pointy-bra-ed Blonde Ambition days. It's a one-off in London's 3,000-capacity Brixton Academy: an intimate affair for Madge, who could fill Wembley Arena several times over. And she's promised an intimate gig: she herself has chosen the support acts - Richard 'ex-Verve' Ashcroft, Sharleen Spiteri from Texas, with The Prodigy's Liam Howlett as DJ - and has declined to let tickets be sold in the usual manner, instead inviting true fans, properly dedicated Madonna nutters, to win their places by queuing at HMV, or winning radio or internet or magazine competitions. </p> <p>Which means, of course, that many have been disappointed. The unlucky hang over the barriers erected all around the Academy, stare mournfully at the entrance, scan the ground on the off-chance that someone's dropped a VIP wristband... so near, yet so far: the very essence of Madonna's recent elevation to the position of High Sorceress of Pop. Before she moved in with Guy Ritchie last year, Madonna seemed so remote as to be a hologram. She existed in videos and magazines, in Hollywood and New York, in a world that included Warren Beatty. Now, she's moved to London and we see pictures of her washing the car, hear of her eating in local(ish) restaurants, know that if we take a trip to Notting Hill we could be within miles, yards, centimetres of her life. It's this proximity that has resulted in Madonna Fever, given her such current potency. Ironic, really; for, of course, she's as far away as ever. She may live a British life - but it's not yours, it's not mine. She lives Madonna-style. A proper pop star in an era of pubescent pretenders, a musical icon who has ridden at least two major career slumps, old enough and dazzling enough to have fans of an age to produce Madonna fans of their own. Or Billie fans, at least. </p> <p>Mind you, even the special powers of New Madonna are tested by the faded Brixton Academy, though she - or someone of her employ - has worked hard to sprinkle the old place with fairy dust. Her sparkly cowboy logo shines over the entrance, and once you're finally in (after a 40-minute check-your-bag queue), you're confronted with tinselled walls and twinkling lights, with glinting rhinestones and golden cowboy hats and... the usual sticky carpet. A large M glows up high, between a pair of musical notes and a lucky horseshoe, which my eye reads as M U, and makes me think of Manchester United. Or the noise of a cow. </p> <p>Anyway, the foyer's packed with star-spotting audience members who want to catch the celebs as they traipse up to the balcony. Mick Jagger, Mel C, Jarvis Cocker, Donna Air, Stella McCartney, Chris Evans, Kelly Stereophonic. We fight our way through the rubber-necked and slack-jawed to check the merchandise at the back. A T-shirt for a friend? But, surprisingly, they're all hideous (lime green? a bowling shirt?), so we pick a souvenir rhinestone off a polystyrene cactus instead. </p> <p>Inside the venue proper, Liam Howlett is playing his scuzzed-up, scratch-and-burn mix of indie and hip-hop. To about 700 people. It's 8.40pm but the hall's barely a quarter full. Everyone's still queuing: for the toilet, for a drink, for a T-shirt, to get in. We've missed Sharleen's performance: I ask a punter, who informs that she played 'that hip-hop one' and 'she had a dead nice T-shirt on'. Top marks for our Shar then. </p> <p>At about 9.15pm, Richard Ashcroft appears. What such an insufferable music snob is doing among the pop plebs, we don't know. Other than earning himself a tidy wedge and the complete indifference of the still small crowd. He sings beautifully - 'Bittersweet Symphony', 'Lucky Man', 'The Drugs Don't Work' - but only gets a cheer when he attempts a couple of lines of 'Material Girl'. Off he slopes, and Liam Prodge gets back on the decks. The venue is filling nicely now. At two minutes to 10, Liam plays the opening bars to 'Music' and... BLAM! She's on!! </p> <p>A huge Union Jack is whisked away to reveal Our Lady in a pick-up, surrounded by beef-cake dancers. She grins and launches into 'Impressive Instant' - 'Hello London! Thank you for coming to my party!' - flinging herself on to her dancers' arms and being lifted centre stage. Blimey - she's so close! I am right down the front and by hopping up and down, can make out her safety-pinned T-shirt which bears the names of her children (Rocco on the front, Lola on the back: no Daphne and Celeste, then), can spot her enormous jewelled belt, the glitter on her arms, her necklaces, everything. Finally, the Academy does feel intimate. </p> <p>Madonna performs six songs: 'Impressive Instant', 'Runaway Lover' (weakest), 'Don't Tell Me', 'What It Feels Like For A Girl' (best), a barnstorming 'Holiday', and a triumphant 'Music'. The gig lasts exactly half an hour. She introduces a guitar-playing Mirwais (Music 's producer) who says something incomprehensible; she shouts: 'This one's for all the pop bitches out there' - a reference to a music-insiders' Madonna-loving chat-room; she gets two audience members to 'boogie-woogie', rather unsuccessfully; she dances fantastically, and she sings. She sings very well. Her voice has changed from its Minnie Mouse origins: it's bright and clear, a good strong experienced pop voice.

We go for a drink round the corner, in a hard-to-find upstairs bar called the Brixtonian. We leave at 11.45pm. At midnight, Madonna and Guy Ritchie walk into the same bar and have a drink... See?

      "bodyText": "Madonna Brixton Academy, London SW9 'I have a pet theory about Madonna,' says a mate a few hours before we're due to see the Queen of Pop perform. 'Every time she releases an album, women finish with their boyfriends. There's always one track on the LP that does it. With Music, it's \"What It Feels Like For A Girl\". Women wake up, put that on, and shazam! he's out.' The man who told me that is a recent dumpee, so his relationship doctrines should be taken with a sack-load of salt. Yet his claim falls on receptive ears. We consider it, and nod sagely. This is because for the past few months, we have all been witness to The Unique Powers Of Madonna: her witchy charms, her blast-all-before-thee charisma, her special magic. Quiver! as the prospect of winning tickets to her concert reduces grown-ups to blubbering wrecks live on national radio. Cower! as you realise that touts are selling said tickets for \u00a31,000 - each! Be very afraid! when you finally acknowledge that all the usual ligging methods - chatting up PRs, pulling in favours, even offering to pay for a sodding pass - are not going to work this time and you're going to have to watch the gig over the internet, all small and jerky... Or, of course, be very smug! because you've got a spare invite and you are the suddenly the most interesting and important of all your friends. Hee hee. Such is Madonna's current voodoo that you feel as though her ticket could spontaneously combust: you keep your hand in your pocket, to check that the precious paper is still there. This concert is the first she's given in Britain for seven years, the first since the pointy-bra-ed Blonde Ambition days. It's a one-off in London's 3,000-capacity Brixton Academy: an intimate affair for Madge, who could fill Wembley Arena several times over. And she's promised an intimate gig: she herself has chosen the support acts - Richard 'ex-Verve' Ashcroft, Sharleen Spiteri from Texas, with The Prodigy's Liam Howlett as DJ - and has declined to let tickets be sold in the usual manner, instead inviting true fans, properly dedicated Madonna nutters, to win their places by queuing at HMV, or winning radio or internet or magazine competitions. Which means, of course, that many have been disappointed. The unlucky hang over the barriers erected all around the Academy, stare mournfully at the entrance, scan the ground on the off-chance that someone's dropped a VIP wristband... so near, yet so far: the very essence of Madonna's recent elevation to the position of High Sorceress of Pop. Before she moved in with Guy Ritchie last year, Madonna seemed so remote as to be a hologram. She existed in videos and magazines, in Hollywood and New York, in a world that included Warren Beatty. Now, she's moved to London and we see pictures of her washing the car, hear of her eating in local(ish) restaurants, know that if we take a trip to Notting Hill we could be within miles, yards, centimetres of her life.

      "body": "<p><strong> Anselm Kiefer </strong> Anthony d'Offay Gallery, London W1 until 14 December <br><strong> Painting the Century </strong> National Portrait Gallery, London WC2 until 4 February <br><strong> Turner Prize</strong> </p> <p> Anselm Keifer is, by general consent, the patriarch of German painting: an artist of grand vision, deep reading and melancholy soul whose work can be seen from Berlin to Nebraska. For 30 years, he has been pondering his nation's past - not to mention the rest of Europe - and issuing lest-we-forget jeremiads. Some people find these tarry paintings bombastic and coarse; others find them visually awesome. But among history painters, of whom there are too few these days, Kiefer is the acknowledged heavyweight champion. </p> <p>History, of course, does not stop at home. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, Germany has moved on - and so has Kiefer. Last time we saw him in London, back in 1992, he was ruminating on the fate of women in the French Revolution. Now he has shifted to communist China. All the works in this show are based on Mao's lethal invitation to Chinese intellectuals in 1957: 'Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend.' Those who took him at his word, of course, were often worked to death on the land: which leads Kiefer straight back to those promised flowers, multiplied here by the thousand. </p> <p>There are vast fields of poppies, drowning in mud-thick paint. There are acres of lilies, strangled in thickets of briars. Real dried roses bristle from the caked surface like arrows. The flowers have withered, the vine is dead, Mao's words - didactically inscribed on each canvas - are densely overgrown. It isn't every day you see literalism run quite so rampant. </p> <p>Each landscape is planted with an image of Mao himself, based on those kitsch icons in which the dictator extends a beneficent hand to his flock. Sometimes Mao appears on a poster, hovering among the flowers like a placard minus the stick. Sometimes he casts a long shadow over the ruined earth. Kiefer paints as cack-handedly as possible to blur the figure's identity - monolithic and faceless in his greatcoat, Mao doubles as Uncle Joe; arm raised slightly higher, he is Hitler in full salute. </p> <p>Kiefer has his reputation to think of, and it's a reputation for perplexing, momentous gestures. Why did he have himself photographed, in 1969, Sieg Heiling his way across Europe? To shock, to parody, to reproach, or, as he claimed, to experience true Nazi identity? Was that dormitory of iron beds in his last London show a morgue, a hospital, a concentration camp or - tendentiously - all three? And what did Kiefer have to say about Charlotte Corday et al beyond listing their names on the wall? </p> <p>So, with this Mao series, Kiefer likes to have it all ways. Mao is a three-in-one despot, a fallen idol, a pathetic relic. But he is also an icon of hope, rising above the lilies. Some paintings are overwhelmingly sentimental: Mao standing in an idyllic meadow, or vanishing beneath the sands of time like the Statue of Liberty in Planet of the Apes. Radical nostalgia, resounding rebuke: you could read them either way. </p> <p>Even now, Kiefer scholars will be debating the iconography. But I think these heavy ambiguities are fast becoming a ruse. Look at these wall-sized pictures and you see Kiefer taking Pollock to the limit, turning the spatters of paint into dense, encrusted surfaces, plastered with decaying relics. Without the references to Mao, so portentous and yet so shallow, these grand paintings would lose all their phoney tension and revert to what they really are: late flowerings of Abstract Expressionism. </p> <p>There are lots of despots in <strong> Painting the Century: 101 Portraits 1900-2000</strong> and Kiefer's Maos might as well be among them, since the NPG has stretched the definition of a portrait beyond the proverbial elastic. L\u00e9ger does Chaplin as a wooden puzzle. Basquiat does Warhol as a rotten banana. Hockney paints rear-view heads, \u00e0 la Magritte. Bowie becomes a thin, black duke - any duke, he has no discernible features - in Steven Finer's tortured canvas. </p> <p>The century, the portrait or the people: this show can't quite decide which story it wants to tell. But the chaos is often enthralling. There is Queen Victoria, in her marmoreal weeds, still alive in 1900, still mourning Albert after 40 years, directly opposite Albert Gleizes's bristlingly cubist portrait of a doctor from 1914. There is Felix Nussbaum's imperishably defiant 'Self-portrait in the Concentration Camp' alongside Dali's steel magnate, swathed in tin-foil toga. Lenin looking like a flat-capped lad from a Hovis ad; Helena Rubinstein eulogised in what appears to be molten lipstick. </p> <p>As the century of the Self progresses, the portrait as a description of public office dwindles into fatuous anachronism. John Wonnacott paints the founder of British Caledonian Airways among his planes in 1986. The hangar is depicted in fulsome detail, but the entrepreneur is an empty suit - a boardroom shot in Campaign would have revealed more character. Compare this with Lovis Corinth's subversively weird portrait of a German zoo-owner in 1911, dressed in homburg and costly suit, one hand resting on a walrus that seems to be nuzzling his lap. The status of the portrait artist takes a sharp decline, all the way from Corinth's relative autonomy to Wonnacott's constraints as stenographer to the rich. </p> <p>These subtexts and mounting narratives are precisely what make this show. There are some great paintings on loan - Sickert, Philip Guston, George Scholz, a haunting image of Anna Akhmatova from St Petersburg - and there is outstandingly awful tat. But in this context, everything is made to count - each work reveals something about the age, the art, the patrons or their taste, no matter how bad the portrait. </p> <p>A footnote: Wolfgang Tillmans wins the <strong> Turner Prize </strong> with his mild, innocuous photographs, arranged across the gallery walls like a magazine layout without the text. What's not to like in these snapshots of the unexceptional, which make no claims on the mind? The artist himself is pleasantly humble when accepting his cheque, sensitive to the non-event that is the Turner Prize. </p> <p>High time that the award - though not the exhibition that accompanies it - should be recognised for what it is: a nil-credibility competition with ludicrous, unworkable rules; a meaningless contest; a footnote.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>Horizon: Supermassive Black Holes</strong> BBC2 <br><strong>The David Beckham Story</strong> ITV <br><strong>Take a Girl Like You</strong> BBC1<br><strong>Omnibus: Kingsley Amis - The Old Devil</strong> BBC1</p> <p>'There could be a supermassive black hole,' warned the Horizon narrator with apocalyptic glee, 'hiding at the very heart of our galaxy.' </p> <p>In which case, I would begin the search for it somewhere in the Cheshire countryside, just outside Manchester. This is where David Beckham, the footballer and supermarket-till celebrity, lives in frenetic isolation. </p> <p>If it did nothing else, <strong>The David Beckham Story</strong> revealed the absorbing emptiness of contemporary superfame. Fans, photographers, managers, magazine editors and, of course, a camera crew were seen orbiting Beckham, each drawn closer and closer, sucked in by the extraordinary gravitational pull of his duck-billed pout and easy smile. Esquire solemnly announced that he was an 'icon', no less. OK! wanted him in his bathroom. Yet for all the attention, barely a flicker of illumination escaped from behind his blank brown eyes. </p> <p>The conventional line on Beckham, and one both programme and player had fun with, is that his opaqueness is nothing more than dimness. His wife - referred to here always as Victoria, never 'Posh Spice' - was particularly keen to kill the brainless Becks myth. But her touching protectiveness was largely counterproductive. </p> <p>On this point, the opening scene was cleverly instructive. In the foreground we saw Beckham drinking a cup of tea in his roomy kitchen, while in the fuzzy distance, with her back to the camera, his wife busied herself at the sink.

      "bodyText": "Horizon: Supermassive Black Holes BBC2 The David Beckham Story ITV Take a Girl Like You BBC1 Omnibus: Kingsley Amis - The Old Devil BBC1 'There could be a supermassive black hole,' warned the Horizon narrator with apocalyptic glee, 'hiding at the very heart of our galaxy.' In which case, I would begin the search for it somewhere in the Cheshire countryside, just outside Manchester. This is where David Beckham, the footballer and supermarket-till celebrity, lives in frenetic isolation. If it did nothing else, The David Beckham Story revealed the absorbing emptiness of contemporary superfame. Fans, photographers, managers, magazine editors and, of course, a camera crew were seen orbiting Beckham, each drawn closer and closer, sucked in by the extraordinary gravitational pull of his duck-billed pout and easy smile. Esquire solemnly announced that he was an 'icon', no less. OK! wanted him in his bathroom. Yet for all the attention, barely a flicker of illumination escaped from behind his blank brown eyes. The conventional line on Beckham, and one both programme and player had fun with, is that his opaqueness is nothing more than dimness. His wife - referred to here always as Victoria, never 'Posh Spice' - was particularly keen to kill the brainless Becks myth. But her touching protectiveness was largely counterproductive. On this point, the opening scene was cleverly instructive. In the foreground we saw Beckham drinking a cup of tea in his roomy kitchen, while in the fuzzy distance, with her back to the camera, his wife busied herself at the sink. 'Why do you think you're the most caricatured couple in Britain?' asked the unseen interviewer. Beckham's mouth moved, but only to chew a biscuit. The voice that answered was his wife's. And while both sought to send up Victoria's trouser-wearing authority, it was clear that in this marriage Beckham was left, so to speak, sporting the sarong. And you suspect that if it were up to him, he'd be very happy with that arrangement. For Beckham's most endearing quality is that he appears - at least off the pitch - utterly without machismo or ego. Which makes it all the more curious that he should be so monumentally vain. There is, it must be said, nothing remotely neurotic about Beckham's vanity. He's not that complex.

When Beckham mentioned that many people thought he was stupid, she consoled him by saying: 'They're all ugly.' The list of those who have lived their lives so continually in the public glare, and not been driven mad, is mercilessly short, so short that I cannot think of a single name on it. And Beckham, for all the schoolboyish innocence of his love, both for himself and his family, does not look 100 per cent Priory-proof. We saw him in the midst of a depression brought on by yet another photo-shoot. 'It's come to the point where I'm fed up with it,' he said, as he played, rather too poignantly, with his son's toy car.

I'd heard Ross Perot was thinking of taking over. Ralph Nader might be good. And then there's Noriega, or maybe we could get him for the board.'</p> <p>Levity aside, Allen has grown impatient with the deluge of unmitigated gloom heaped on Covent Garden. 'It's time to put away three years of nonsense. It's terribly easy for the most venerable members of the press to jump on the bandwagon and attack things without knowing the full story. What's crucial is what goes on in front of the curtain, not behind. The complaints about the cost of a soloist or a production seem to have become their chief concern.

Critics have been called many things but they are not usually known for their skill with money. He admits, however, that the newly configured House has a way to go before it can recapture the old feeling of intimacy. 'There's always been a strong family feeling in the place, and it's not lost. But the geography of the building is different. Some of the faces are the same, many are new. No one's lost sight of where we're going but we need to regain that sense of company.'</p> <p>Having grown up in a blue-collar family in the industrial North East, he heard no opera as a child and had none of the champagne privileges usually associated with the art form in which he reigns supreme.</p> <p>Gripes about toffs, ticket prices and exclusivity exasperate him. 'The press paints a totally inaccurate picture of what goes on. You only ever see pictures of people in dinner jackets. But almost nobody wears them except at charity galas. On an ordinary night, once you get away from the front stalls, people are there because that's the treat they've saved up for, because they love it. They wear what they want.</p> <p>'But don't get me wrong. I love \u00e9litism. You might say I grew up on it on the slag tips of County Durham. If you want excellence, you can't escape \u00e9litism. It's the same with football. Cream rises to the top. Manchester United wants the best and works hard to get it. It's nearly as expensive and impossible to get into a great football match as into an opera house. The government should be proud of a place like Covent Garden and support it, instead of sending us out with our begging bowls. Take the Metropolitan Opera in New York. Nearly half the funding comes from private money. There are tax incentives, it's true. But I think people give because they're proud of the place. Here everyone decries and mistrusts high art and tries to destroy it.'</p> <p>It all comes back to education, he says. Grammar school gave him a passport into a different world. 'I was Billy Elliot. I sympathised with so much in that film. Where I came from everyone who could pull themselves up by their bootstraps did just that. We knew there was a choice if we could find out how to make it. It was up to us. And it was even written all over the buses. The one I took to school said Scholars on the front and went in one direction. The other said Workmen and took the men to the pithead. We knew we never in all our lives wanted to be on that bus.'</p> <p>His parents weren't especially musical but recognised their son had talent and backed him in all his ambitions. 'Right up until they died, they'd be worried if I had catarrh. I've got it now, but I've learned how to deal with such things. I don't fuss too much. I reckon it's better to get fresh air than cosset yourself. I'd rather go for a brisk walk on the downs than huddle inside with a scarf wrapped round me.'</p> <p>Indeed with his brown corduroy trousers, polo-necked jersey and clear-eyed gaze, Allen has the kind of wholesome, faintly Nordic look which has guaranteed him a loyal female (and male) following throughout his career and no doubt earned him a good few proposals of one sort or another. His Durham accent remains strong, and he returns frequently to the North East to see family and to pursue his other passion, for drawing and painting. Shyly, he admits that next year the Chelsea Festival is exhibiting his works.</p> <p>'I love to draw images which were familiar to me in childhood: landscapes, allotments, pitheads, shipyards, industry, houses. I'm fascinated by detail, and things in miniature. I once wanted to be an eye surgeon and I spend a fair bit of time making model ships, with hundreds of intricate parts. It's all part of the same obsession.' He works in pen and ink, acrylics and watercolour, and to his modest delight has sold a few pictures in charity auctions.</p> <p>Inevitably, in his 30-year career some productions have not been to his taste. He recalls with mock horror a particular Die Fledermaus in Munich a couple of years ago.</p> <p>'It was the most miserable professional experience of my life. We arrived for the first rehearsal and the director said, \"I have no concept for this piece.\" Well I know we've all got a bit bogged down in overinterpretation but to have no ideas at all! It was too late to do anything. The piece had no charm, and we had to improvise the dialogue. No wonder we were booed. I've done things recently with minimal props and costumes which have been as valid as some productions where we've spent weeks defining a character. It's unfashionable to say it but I think it's sometimes valid to spend only a day brushing up something you know, like Madam Butterfly. That can often produce exciting results because you have to think on your feet and be totally committed.'</p> <p>He is constantly surprised by how little audiences know about the process of making an opera.</p> <p>'No one really seems to have a clue about how singers relate to productions, and what goes on in the rehearsal rooms. Take The Turk in Italy, which I've just been doing at ENO. Whether you like it or not is not the point. Perhaps as long as two years ago, someone decided it would be reworked, based on Fellini's film 8. The singer plays no part in that discussion. His or her job is to show up on time and in three to four weeks master the production. The skill in doing that is often not realised. In ideal circumstances - as with, say David Pountney and Mark Elder - producer and conductor have a happy and creative rapport. On occasions the producer is dominant, less often the conductor who sometimes can't get a word in edgeways and has to bow to the sacred cow of theatre. The singers are just cannon fodder in the midst of often fairly bloody battles. You often feel like walking out but you can't. Who would support you? Not the management, because they'd be admitting they'd made a mistake in their choice of team.'</p> <p>Britons such as Allen and his fellow northerner, the bass John Tomlinson, have done much to debunk the notion that singers can't act. A regular theatregoer, Allen's sophisticated stage skills have always been one of his great strengths - in roles such as Billy Budd or Don Giovanni or Count Almaviva. He calls himself 'a sponge', learning by observation and imitation.</p> <p>'I've always felt happy to act. In the first rehearsal of Albert Herring once, I was the butcher boy. There was a pile of fruit on the table. I sat down, put my feet up, and started peeling a banana. Another singer said, \"When did you learn that?\" - as if I'd had advanced coaching from the producer. I said it just seemed an obvious thing to do.'</p> <p>His voice is still virile, his diary packed with engagements at home and abroad, in opera as well as the recitals and concerts which have always been central to his career. Currently he is appearing as P\u00e8re Germont in Richard Eyre's production of La Traviata at ROH, with Pfitzner's Palestrina on the horizon. His goal is to play straight theatre roles at the National or RSC if the chance ever arises.</p> <p>'Just occasionally, when you're following a musical line, you reach a cul de sac. The music does one thing and the character seems to want to do another. The actor in you wants to go further, but the singing part of you holds you back. In theatre, you don't have that dilemma. My ideal would be to sing Beckmesser [in Wagner's Die Meistersinger] and then play Malvolio [in Twelfth Night ]. I'd love to take on David Hare, who has often spoken out on the direness of opera acting. He really needs to see a few more operas.'</p> <p>La Traviata continues in rep on 5, 9, 13 and 18 December, and Palestrina is on 8 February 2001; BBC2 will broadcast Masterclass with Thomas Allen on 12 December, 11.20pm</p>",

Shyly, he admits that next year the Chelsea Festival is exhibiting his works. 'I love to draw images which were familiar to me in childhood: landscapes, allotments, pitheads, shipyards, industry, houses. I'm fascinated by detail, and things in miniature. I once wanted to be an eye surgeon and I spend a fair bit of time making model ships, with hundreds of intricate parts. It's all part of the same obsession.' He works in pen and ink, acrylics and watercolour, and to his modest delight has sold a few pictures in charity auctions. Inevitably, in his 30-year career some productions have not been to his taste. He recalls with mock horror a particular Die Fledermaus in Munich a couple of years ago. 'It was the most miserable professional experience of my life. We arrived for the first rehearsal and the director said, \"I have no concept for this piece.\" Well I know we've all got a bit bogged down in overinterpretation but to have no ideas at all! It was too late to do anything. The piece had no charm, and we had to improvise the dialogue. No wonder we were booed. I've done things recently with minimal props and costumes which have been as valid as some productions where we've spent weeks defining a character. It's unfashionable to say it but I think it's sometimes valid to spend only a day brushing up something you know, like Madam Butterfly. That can often produce exciting results because you have to think on your feet and be totally committed.' He is constantly surprised by how little audiences know about the process of making an opera. 'No one really seems to have a clue about how singers relate to productions, and what goes on in the rehearsal rooms. Take The Turk in Italy, which I've just been doing at ENO. Whether you like it or not is not the point. Perhaps as long as two years ago, someone decided it would be reworked, based on Fellini's film 8. The singer plays no part in that discussion. His or her job is to show up on time and in three to four weeks master the production. The skill in doing that is often not realised. In ideal circumstances - as with, say David Pountney and Mark Elder - producer and conductor have a happy and creative rapport. On occasions the producer is dominant, less often the conductor who sometimes can't get a word in edgeways and has to bow to the sacred cow of theatre. The singers are just cannon fodder in the midst of often fairly bloody battles. You often feel like walking out but you can't. Who would support you? Not the management, because they'd be admitting they'd made a mistake in their choice of team.' Britons such as Allen and his fellow northerner, the bass John Tomlinson, have done much to debunk the notion that singers can't act. A regular theatregoer, Allen's sophisticated stage skills have always been one of his great strengths - in roles such as Billy Budd or Don Giovanni or Count Almaviva. He calls himself 'a sponge', learning by observation and imitation. 'I've always felt happy to act. In the first rehearsal of Albert Herring once, I was the butcher boy. There was a pile of fruit on the table. I sat down, put my feet up, and started peeling a banana. Another singer said, \"When did you learn that?\" - as if I'd had advanced coaching from the producer. I said it just seemed an obvious thing to do.' His voice is still virile, his diary packed with engagements at home and abroad, in opera as well as the recitals and concerts which have always been central to his career. Currently he is appearing as P\u00e8re Germont in Richard Eyre's production of La Traviata at ROH, with Pfitzner's Palestrina on the horizon. His goal is to play straight theatre roles at the National or RSC if the chance ever arises. 'Just occasionally, when you're following a musical line, you reach a cul de sac. The music does one thing and the character seems to want to do another. The actor in you wants to go further, but the singing part of you holds you back. In theatre, you don't have that dilemma. My ideal would be to sing Beckmesser [in Wagner's Die Meistersinger] and then play Malvolio [in Twelfth Night ]. I'd love to take on David Hare, who has often spoken out on the direness of opera acting. He really needs to see a few more operas.' La Traviata continues in rep on 5, 9, 13 and 18 December, and Palestrina is on 8 February 2001; BBC2 will broadcast Masterclass with Thomas Allen on 12 December, 11.20pm",

Your world is dominated by what you won't give yourself. </p> <p>Shame on us, though, if we hand on our misery to our children, who are going to come under enough pressure anyway from their peers and from the images they see everywhere they go of beauty as fragility and extreme thinness; strength and curves as somehow ugly. </p> <p>There's a morality now about eating. Abstinence is purity and indulgence is corrupt. The Duchess of York, self-confessed comfort-guzzler of cream, eggs and mayonnaise sandwiches, plays what she calls 'diet games' with her daughters. </p> <p>Brilliant. </p> <p>An alarmingly high number of children are overweight and have furred arteries by the time they reach puberty, from eating junk food and not exercising. At the same time, an estimated seven out of 10 girls feel they are heavier than they should be, and have a neurotic relationship with their bodies and with food. Children have been known to be anorexic by the age of six. </p> <p>We have become alienated from food and eating - cramming crisps and sweets into your mouth as you watch telly isn't about nutrition or hunger; it's about a kind of passivity. Starving and bingeing isn't just about wanting to lose weight - it's about wanting to disappear, to purify yourself, to deny your sexuality, to be someone else. </p> <p>It's rare for women to have a perfectly straightforward attitude to food. Women often eat when they are sad, depressed, unconfident, angry, bored, lonely; when they feel drab and unloved. Of course children should learn not to eat chocolate or biscuits for breakfast, and greasy burgers made from testicles and hooves for tea. They should be taught the value of good food and its pleasure and variety. </p> <p>But they shouldn't learn, before they even hit puberty, to panic about the numbers on their plate and to fear the inches around their waists.</p>",

In some restaurants, calorific values were put on the menu. With each mouthful, you were number-crunching. We were the generation of anorexics in waiting, thinking of food not with pleasure but with guilt and anxiety. For we should all know by now that dieting is like giving up smoking - the more you resist, the more you crave. Your world is dominated by what you won't give yourself. Shame on us, though, if we hand on our misery to our children, who are going to come under enough pressure anyway from their peers and from the images they see everywhere they go of beauty as fragility and extreme thinness; strength and curves as somehow ugly. There's a morality now about eating. Abstinence is purity and indulgence is corrupt. The Duchess of York, self-confessed comfort-guzzler of cream, eggs and mayonnaise sandwiches, plays what she calls 'diet games' with her daughters. Brilliant. An alarmingly high number of children are overweight and have furred arteries by the time they reach puberty, from eating junk food and not exercising. At the same time, an estimated seven out of 10 girls feel they are heavier than they should be, and have a neurotic relationship with their bodies and with food. Children have been known to be anorexic by the age of six. We have become alienated from food and eating - cramming crisps and sweets into your mouth as you watch telly isn't about nutrition or hunger; it's about a kind of passivity. Starving and bingeing isn't just about wanting to lose weight - it's about wanting to disappear, to purify yourself, to deny your sexuality, to be someone else. It's rare for women to have a perfectly straightforward attitude to food. Women often eat when they are sad, depressed, unconfident, angry, bored, lonely; when they feel drab and unloved. Of course children should learn not to eat chocolate or biscuits for breakfast, and greasy burgers made from testicles and hooves for tea. They should be taught the value of good food and its pleasure and variety. But they shouldn't learn, before they even hit puberty, to panic about the numbers on their plate and to fear the inches around their waists.",

Rather, his style is to use reasoned argument and gentle persuasion - spiked, if necessary, with the reminder that sweeter deals will follow if the investor could just take his word on this one. </p> <p>Given this reputation for sweet-talking, it is surprising how unconvincing his arguments for Cazenove's incorporation sound. The announcement that it was to switch from being a partnership to a company, and a publicly quoted one at that, was greeted with little real surprise in the City. After all, everyone else has done it - even the mighty Goldman Sachs succumbed to the lure of a public listing last year. </p> <p>But Caz, as it is almost always known, has thrived by refusing to do the obvious. A traditional stockbroker, it refused to join the rush to buy a jobber - then, the only people allowed to make a market in shares - when the London Stock Exchange abandoned its anachronistic trading structure at Big Bang in 1987. Instead, it simply expanded its services by making a market in the shares of its own corporate clients. </p> <p>It was not seduced by the fashion for one-stop shopping. While other venerable City houses, such as SG Warburg, decided they had to offer a complete investment banking service, Cazenove has stuck determinedly to its niche of corporate broking. </p> <p>Likewise, it has avoided the temptation to expand too far overseas. It has followed its clients to Europe and the Far East, picking up some European ones on the way, but largely by getting on the plane at Heathrow. It has an office in New York, but one used solely for distributing international equities to US investors: it has never tried to take on the big US houses at their own domestic game. </p> <p>Such single-mindedness has often been derided. Rivals, who grouped themselves into stock market conglomerates in 1987, predicted that Cazenove would never survive as an independent broker. When these same firms were then swallowed up by foreign investment banks, they predicted that the broking business that had gone to Caz would now be taken in-house. </p> <p>But those who predicted Cazenove's demise reckoned without its clients, who have stayed intensely loyal to its brand of service. Many of the most illustrious names of the 1980s have disappeared - who now remembers Wedd Durlacher, Rowe &amp; Pitman or Quilter Goodison? And how long will it be before names like Schroders, Warburgs or Kleinwort Benson, subjects of more recent takeovers, disappear in the same way. </p> <p>Caz, meanwhile, counts half of the FTSE 100 and a third of the FTSE 250 among its clients. It is ninth in the mergers and acquisitions league table so far this year, helped by its involvement in deals like Bank of Scotland's talks with Abbey National and the sale of Thames Water to the German utility RWE. </p> <p>Mayhew believes that trust has been the key to Caz's success. 'Our clients have valued the service we provide. There has been continuity of our people, they understand what we are doing and they value our advice.' </p> <p>So why change a winning formula? Mayhew's explanation is that the growth of the European markets means Caz now needs to 'go to ground' in various areas where it does not yet have offices. Opening offices costs money and requires the recruitment of top people. Both, Mayhew believes, will be easier if the company has a listing. </p> <p>Neither argument is wholly convincing. Certainly, a stock market flotation will raise funds: the current plan is to sell about 10 per cent of its shares to institutions. On Caz's rather conservative estimate of a \u00a31.5 billion valuation, that would raise \u00a3150 million. </p> <p>But the small amount of shares that will be made available to the public suggests it is simply doing the minimum necessary to get a quote rather than seriously seeking funds - indeed, opening a few European offices could easily be funded with the profits from a few of its recent takeover bids. </p> <p>But, says Mayhew, it needs to attract people to staff these offices. 'Trying to explain a partnership to those not accustomed to it is difficult enough in the UK; internationally, it is almost impossible. We will have a better chance of keeping people if they think they can own, and earn, shares in the business going forward.' </p> <p>Yet he admits that the firm has had no trouble recruiting staff at graduate level, the difficulty lies in 'attracting heavy-hitters to the middle of the partnership'. But that is a complaint that could be heard from any City firm, partnership or public company, British or American. </p> <p>In fact, good old-fashioned greed is the most likely reason behind the flotation. The firm's 80 partners would like to realise some of the wealth currently tied up in the company while those beavering away just below partnership rank want the guarantee of some share in the wealth they are helping to create. </p> <p>Greed could, as Gordon Gecko claimed, be good. Incorporation may be the only way to ensure that Caz can continue to expand and to attract and retain good people. But it also carries risks - not least of which is that it will make it impossible to maintain Cazenove's traditional low profile. </p> <p>Mayhew shudders at the idea that The Observer might want to do a profile of him. 'I confess I do read them but the questions seem to me rather prying,' he says. </p> <p>As chairman of a public company, he will have to get used to prying - the City is already trying to guess how much of the \u00a31.5bn will end up in his pocket. </p> <p>But the biggest risk is that incorporation will lead to changes in the culture that has made Caz unique. Shorn of its partnership status, will Caz become just another City investment house? And will it become vulnerable to takeover by one of the international financial conglomerates? </p> <p>Mayhew admits that underperformance could lead to a loss of independence. 'An employee-owned business - and this will be heavily employee-owned - will always be vulnerable to approaches but they will not often succeed against the interests of the employees.' </p> <p>Indeed, Caz is likely to do all it can to ensure that employees will not vote for takeover. Employee shares, which will account for about 20 per cent of the issue, will be held in a voting trust, with restrictions on selling. </p> <p>The partners, who will take 70 per cent of the issue, will also have selling restrictions. But these cannot last forever. Neither, of course, can Mayhew. Now 60, he will not give a retirement date - whenever he is asked, he says 'in two years' - but he will, eventually, take a back seat. </p> <p>He bristles at the suggestion that this was the reason for the decision to incorporate. Indeed, the people who will make up the management team when it incorporates - including Robert Pickering and Nigel Rowe, joint heads of investment banking, and Tim Steel from fund management - are eminently able and widely respected. </p> <p>But Cazenove will miss Mayhew - whose reputation survived his entanglement in the Guinness affair which destroyed so many others - as much as the City will miss its partnership status.</p>",

Please deliver to Cammell Laird, Birkenhead Shipyard, Merseyside. </p> <p>It sounds farcical, but it is no more so than surreal pictures showing a 13-deck hulk, intended to be the mid-section of an Italian vessel, listing like an amputee in Birkenhead's docks. </p> <p>The proposed bow and stern - AKA the cruise ship Costa Classica - were supposed to arrive in one piece at Birkenhead on 23 November, ready to be cut in half and welded to either end of the mid-section. However, a day before arrival the Classica's owners, Italian cruise line Costa Crociere, ordered her to return to Italy. A more absurd comedy of errors could scarcely have been scripted. </p> <p>But here the comedy ends. </p> <p>The fiasco piles further ignominy on a once-great company.

Some of those customers, particularly US ones, are litigious, so rescheduling can be very expensive.' </p> <p>The Costa contract is the biggest and one of the most complex conversions ever undertaken. The present stand-off is the culmination of intricate manoeuvrings between Costa, desperate to have a bigger ship ready on time, and Cammell, desperate to deliver. </p> <p>Costa says it is not satisfied that Cammell can complete on time and to specification, and that it may be due compensation. It wants these issues resolved before returning the Classica to Merseyside. It has not yet terminated the deal - it is seeking arbitration from an Italian legal professor. </p> <p>Company spokesman Luigi Norsa told The Observer that the original contract, signed in September 1999, stated that all work had to be completed by 22 March 2001. </p> <p>He added that by the time the Classica arrived at Birkenhead all work on the section had to be completed and tested. This had not happened - as Cammell concedes. </p> <p>Norsa said Costa raised concerns last March about timely completion. Two technical reports from marine consultant Brookes Bell - one on 21 August, one on 4 October - advised on progress and whether the 22 March deadline could be met. </p> <p>Costa says the reports detailed problems causing delays, as Cammell admitted to The Observer. However, Costa conceded that Brookes Bell said if action were taken, the March deadline could be met. Costa contends that that action has not been taken. </p> <p>Cammell's operations director John Syvret disagrees. A key factor, he says, is that in December 1999, Costa varied the contract to place machinery in lower compartments rather than water and ballast. </p> <p>'That was a major change,' says Syvret. It meant costs increased, but Cammell guaranteed crucially that both the weight and the 22 March deadline would not vary. Syvret says the project was rescheduled, which meant some work on the section being completed after the Classica arrived, in parallel with integration. </p> <p>Martin says: 'Their attitude still baffles me. If they did not believe we could deliver, why did they leave Genoa and turn back a day before they reached us?' </p> <p>Cammell and union officials have questioned whether timing was the stumbling block. One Cammell official said that 'when the original deal was signed Costa Crociere was jointly owned by Carnival and Airtours. Carnival later bought the majority. Carnival prefers new ships rather than conversions'. </p> <p>A union official suggested the company may have been pressurised by the Italian government to do the work in Italian yards. Another union official said: 'We have heard Costa has problems with another vessel, the Costa Riviera. We are worried that they would rather enter arbitration with Cammell Laird than have to reschedule cruises, and pay compensation.' </p> <p>Costa Crociere disputes this, along with rumours about the Italian government. Norsa said: 'Costa Riviera is undergoing planned work in dry dock. She went in on 17 November, and is due out on 17 December. There is no link with the Classica.' </p> <p>But if the Classica does put to sea in the near future a row beckons that could add a political dimension to what the UK Government insists is a commercial dispute. </p> <p>Unions are watching closely. The position for the 1,000 workers is precarious. But there is hope - ironically from the market for new-build passenger ships, which Britain exited after the last contract, a P&amp;O ferry, was completed at Govan in 1987. </p> <p>Figures from GP Wild show \u00a321.3 billion of known contracts for new-build - the majority spread around four European yards. There is no British presence. </p> <p>Cammell is, however, hoping to secure a deal to build two 28,000-tonne ships for US-based Luxus. A deal would make additional smaller contracts viable. </p> <p>The GMB's Charlie Leonard says Cammell has refitting on three ships including a Stena ferry - dependent on the workforce staying. </p> <p>Political considerations are paramount. Luxus will only proceed if Trade Secretary Stephen Byers agrees to a 9 per cent aid package and an 80 per cent mortgage guarantee permissible under EU rules. Byers has until the end of the year to agree - the EU regulations are being scrapped then. Even if there is no immediate resolution with Costa, work on the Luxus ships could start early next year, meaning lay-offs could be temporary. </p> <p>Nevertheless, none of the players in this drama is likely to emerge happy - a messy arbitration will not only harm relations between Cammell and a powerful customer, but could contribute to increased europhobia in this country. Byers, however, faces Tory taunts of propping up another failing industry. </p> <p>But with an election looming and 'heartland' jobs at a premium, the smart money is on Byers throwing another lifeline to UK manufacturing. And that would mean a dignified end to a demeaning farce. </p> <p><strong>Industry sails into a specialist future</strong></p> <p>If you had asked an Irishman in Birkenhead last week (and there were a few) how to build a ship, he might have looked out over the water and said: 'I wouldn't start from here.' </p> <p>But the techniques used to extend the Costa Classica reflect the realities of modern shipbuilding, where UK builders complain of Koreans building supertankers at below cost and surreptitious subsidies slipping into the back pockets of European yards. </p> <p>Conversion may seem a weird way to build a ship, but the market has the hallmarks of a haven for ex-growth, high-cost producers - it is niche and it is highly skilled.

      "bodyText": "Wanted: one bow and one stern for incomplete 26,000-tonne cruise ship. Please deliver to Cammell Laird, Birkenhead Shipyard, Merseyside. It sounds farcical, but it is no more so than surreal pictures showing a 13-deck hulk, intended to be the mid-section of an Italian vessel, listing like an amputee in Birkenhead's docks. The proposed bow and stern - AKA the cruise ship Costa Classica - were supposed to arrive in one piece at Birkenhead on 23 November, ready to be cut in half and welded to either end of the mid-section. However, a day before arrival the Classica's owners, Italian cruise line Costa Crociere, ordered her to return to Italy. A more absurd comedy of errors could scarcely have been scripted. But here the comedy ends. The fiasco piles further ignominy on a once-great company. Compare the pathetic sight of the orphaned ship's belly with the famous images of HMS Ark Royal towering over post-war Merseyside terraces - when Britain accounted for 38 per cent of the world merchant market rather than the 1 per cent of today.

Or at least it is until Wednesday, when the Competition Commission's latest weighty investigation into the brewing industry thuds on to Trade and Industry Secretary Stephen Byers's desk. </p> <p>Under the microscope is the biggest shake-up - and sell-out - the sector has seen: Belgian drinks giant Interbrew's audacious \u00a32.3 billion swallowing of Bass Brewers in August and, inextricably linked, its acquisition of the Whitbread Beer Company, a \u00a3400 million aperitif in May. </p> <p>At stake is the future of some of Britain's most-downed pints, including Carling Black Label, Draught Bass and Boddingtons. With thousands of jobs also at stake, the decision is also Labour's second big brewing test since coming to power. Three years ago, Byers's predecessor Margaret Beckett simply blocked Bass's merger with Carlsberg-Tetley, a decision which ultimately led to Bass selling out completely. For Interbrew and Bass Brewers, the nightmare outcome is more of the same and this weekend the Belgians' political lobbyists are working overtime in the corridors of Whitehall. </p> <p>The Belgian firm, best known for its 'reassuringly expensive' Stella Artois and outrageously pricey Hoegaarden, is fighting desperately to keep all of its new brands. As we reveal today, however, it has already attracted vultures eager for a slug of the action: Carlsberg-Tetley has already made an approach for Tennents, Scotland's leading lager by far with 50 per cent of the market. </p> <p>Byers's decision, and the Competition Commission's findings, may not be announced until early in the new year. But what seems certain is that the review spells the end game for the 'tie': the captive links between brewers and Britain's pub estates. </p> <p>'As the barest minimum, the Belgians expect to have to give up their cosy supply arrangements with Bass's taverns and Whitbread's pubs,' one industry source said. 'It's the final nail for the tie.' </p> <p>In 1985, the year before the then Monopolies &amp; Mergers Commission first delved into the industry, pubs and brewing were dominated lock, stock and barrel by the old brewers elite, the so-called 'Beerage': Bass, Allied Lyons, Courage, Whitbread, Scottish &amp; Newcastle and Grand Metropolitan. Overseas giants such as Carlsberg, Heineken, Fosters and Stella were forced to strike exclusive deals to bring their lagers to the saloon. </p> <p>Since 1989, when the MMC pronounced that the 'tie' stifled the holy grail of competition, the industry has been in a state of constant upheaval. First to go were swathes of pubs. Now it is the venture capital-backed independents such as Nomura's Grand Pub company and Phoenix Inns, Hugh Osmond's Punch Taverns and Alchemy's InnSpired, which pull most British pints. Next to go, with beer-making increasingly less lucrative than pubs, restaurants, hotels or spirits, are the breweries themselves. </p> <p>The mid-sized regionals such as Greenalls and Vaux have long given up the ghost. Rebuffed by Beckett, Allied Lyons sold its half stake in Carlsberg-Tetley to the Danes. Of the old Beerage, only Scottish &amp; Newcastle has set its store firmly by brewing: In 1995, it snapped up Courage and earlier this year beat off fierce competition to swallow French number one Kronenbourg. </p> <p>The biggest beneficiary has been the latest comer of all. Interbrew's double-header of Whitbread and Bass now gives it 32 per cent of the UK beer market, ahead of Scottish Courage's 29 per cent, while Carlsberg-Tetley trails well behind with 11 per cent. </p> <p>Not bad for an aristocratic outfit, which, until Friday, was wholly privately owned, still boasts two barons, two counts and a viscount on its board, and until five years ago still catered overwhelmingly for Flemings and Walloons, as it had for over 600 years. </p> <p>Interbrew traces its origins back to 1366 and a pub-brewery, Den Hoorn, in deer and boar-hunting country just outside Brussels. In 1717, master brewer Sebastien Artois bought the firm but it was long after he malted his last hop that, in 1926, its flagship brand was fermented: Stella Artois was born as a Christmas beer, taking the Latin for the festive sign as its label. The lager is now sold in 16 countries, it is the number three in Britain's pubs, after Carling and Carlsberg, and, thanks to creative advertising, is the fourth best-selling brand in the UK grocery trade after Coca-Cola, Nescaf\u00e9 and Walkers crisps. </p> <p>Until the late 1980s, however, Brasseries Artois, which also owned Leffe, was just number two in its home market. In 1987, Interbrew was born through a merger with its equally aristocratic rival, Brasseries Piedboeuf, purveyor of Jupiler - Belgium's staple quaff - and Lamot. As a result the firm now controls 56 per cent of the Belgian market. The next best-seller Alken Maes, owned by S&amp;N after its Kronenbourg bid, trails well behind. </p> <p>Interbrew can barely see what the fuss about Bass is all about. 'After Germany, the UK is the and most competitive beer market in Europe,' one Interbrew adviser said. 'The company is also the best prospect for British brewing. There is no viable option for the future other than Interbrew.' </p> <p>The Belgian firm certainly is a specialist brewer, dedicated to home-grown, local brands, with over 150 worldwide. The ground-breaking deal which turned Interbrew from a European bit part into a global performer, came in 1995 with the \u00a31.3bn takeover of Canadian brewer Labatt. That added Canada's equal best-selling beer (Molson is the other), Rolling Rock and a stake in Mexican brewer FEMSA Cerveza, which owns Sol and Dos Equis. It also brought with it Interbrew's current chief executive Hugo Powell, a coolly calculating, sharp-elbowed, public school-educated Brit, who emigrated to Canada 30 years ago and ran Jacobs Suchard in Germany before landing up at Labatt and outsmarting the Belgian competition to take Interbrew's top job last year. </p> <p>'He's been the architect of Interbrew's transformation and flotation,' one adviser said. 'He's calm, never gets flustered and a quiet thinker. He often says he would have become a politician if he wasn't running a brewer.' </p> <p>How apposite, then, that Powell's future may now rest in a real politician's hands. Interbrew made a huge gamble when it took over Bass. The deal was only conditional on European Commission approval, but at Byers's urging the EC batted the scrutiny back to the UK. The uncertainty has already cost Interbrew's patrician, controlling families - the De Mevins, De Spoelberchs and Van Dammes - a packet. Valued at \u00a38.8bn after Friday's market debut, Interbrew is worth \u00a31bn less than they originally hoped. But will Byers's pronouncement ultimately cost one undoubted British export success his job? </p> <p><strong>Big drinkers</strong></p> <p><strong> World's Top 10 Brewers 1999 volume </strong> (million hectalitres) </p> <p>1 Anheuser Busch (US)<strong> 150</strong> </p> <p>2 Heineken (Neth)<strong> 97</strong> </p> <p>3 Interbrew* (Bel)<strong> 88</strong> </p> <p>4 AmBev (Brazil)<strong> 59</strong> </p> <p>5 SAB (S Africa)<strong> 57</strong> </p> <p>6 Miller<strong> </strong> (US)<strong> 52</strong> </p> <p>7 Carlsberg<strong> </strong> (Den)<strong> 49</strong> </p> <p>8 Scottish &amp; Newcastle (UK )<strong> 41 </strong></p> <p>9 Kirin<strong> </strong> (Jap)<strong> 39 </strong></p> <p>10 Guinness<strong> </strong> (UK)<strong> 28</strong> </p> <p> *Interbrew figures include Bass/Whitbread Source: HSBC Securities/Interbrew </p> <p><strong>Favoured tipples</strong></p> <p><strong> Interbrew's leading brands </strong></p> <p> 1 Stella Artois </p> <p>2 Carling Black Label </p> <p>3 Labatt </p> <p>4 Rolling Rock </p> <p>5 Jupiler </p> <p>6 Hoegaarden </p> <p>7 Worthingtons </p> <p>8 Leffe </p> <p>9 Boddingtons </p> <p>10 Tennents</p>",

Overseas giants such as Carlsberg, Heineken, Fosters and Stella were forced to strike exclusive deals to bring their lagers to the saloon. Since 1989, when the MMC pronounced that the 'tie' stifled the holy grail of competition, the industry has been in a state of constant upheaval. First to go were swathes of pubs. Now it is the venture capital-backed independents such as Nomura's Grand Pub company and Phoenix Inns, Hugh Osmond's Punch Taverns and Alchemy's InnSpired, which pull most British pints. Next to go, with beer-making increasingly less lucrative than pubs, restaurants, hotels or spirits, are the breweries themselves. The mid-sized regionals such as Greenalls and Vaux have long given up the ghost. Rebuffed by Beckett, Allied Lyons sold its half stake in Carlsberg-Tetley to the Danes. Of the old Beerage, only Scottish &amp; Newcastle has set its store firmly by brewing: In 1995, it snapped up Courage and earlier this year beat off fierce competition to swallow French number one Kronenbourg. The biggest beneficiary has been the latest comer of all. Interbrew's double-header of Whitbread and Bass now gives it 32 per cent of the UK beer market, ahead of Scottish Courage's 29 per cent, while Carlsberg-Tetley trails well behind with 11 per cent. Not bad for an aristocratic outfit, which, until Friday, was wholly privately owned, still boasts two barons, two counts and a viscount on its board, and until five years ago still catered overwhelmingly for Flemings and Walloons, as it had for over 600 years. Interbrew traces its origins back to 1366 and a pub-brewery, Den Hoorn, in deer and boar-hunting country just outside Brussels. In 1717, master brewer Sebastien Artois bought the firm but it was long after he malted his last hop that, in 1926, its flagship brand was fermented: Stella Artois was born as a Christmas beer, taking the Latin for the festive sign as its label. The lager is now sold in 16 countries, it is the number three in Britain's pubs, after Carling and Carlsberg, and, thanks to creative advertising, is the fourth best-selling brand in the UK grocery trade after Coca-Cola, Nescaf\u00e9 and Walkers crisps. Until the late 1980s, however, Brasseries Artois, which also owned Leffe, was just number two in its home market. In 1987, Interbrew was born through a merger with its equally aristocratic rival, Brasseries Piedboeuf, purveyor of Jupiler - Belgium's staple quaff - and Lamot. As a result the firm now controls 56 per cent of the Belgian market. The next best-seller Alken Maes, owned by S&amp;N after its Kronenbourg bid, trails well behind. Interbrew can barely see what the fuss about Bass is all about. 'After Germany, the UK is the and most competitive beer market in Europe,' one Interbrew adviser said. 'The company is also the best prospect for British brewing. There is no viable option for the future other than Interbrew.' The Belgian firm certainly is a specialist brewer, dedicated to home-grown, local brands, with over 150 worldwide. The ground-breaking deal which turned Interbrew from a European bit part into a global performer, came in 1995 with the \u00a31.3bn takeover of Canadian brewer Labatt. That added Canada's equal best-selling beer (Molson is the other), Rolling Rock and a stake in Mexican brewer FEMSA Cerveza, which owns Sol and Dos Equis. It also brought with it Interbrew's current chief executive Hugo Powell, a coolly calculating, sharp-elbowed, public school-educated Brit, who emigrated to Canada 30 years ago and ran Jacobs Suchard in Germany before landing up at Labatt and outsmarting the Belgian competition to take Interbrew's top job last year. 'He's been the architect of Interbrew's transformation and flotation,' one adviser said. 'He's calm, never gets flustered and a quiet thinker. He often says he would have become a politician if he wasn't running a brewer.' How apposite, then, that Powell's future may now rest in a real politician's hands. Interbrew made a huge gamble when it took over Bass. The deal was only conditional on European Commission approval, but at Byers's urging the EC batted the scrutiny back to the UK. The uncertainty has already cost Interbrew's patrician, controlling families - the De Mevins, De Spoelberchs and Van Dammes - a packet. Valued at \u00a38.8bn after Friday's market debut, Interbrew is worth \u00a31bn less than they originally hoped. But will Byers's pronouncement ultimately cost one undoubted British export success his job?

On the other hand, the European Services Forum (ESF), an umbrella group for law firms, accountants and management consultants, is pressuring the EU to negotiate on its behalf through the WTO to allow it to break into the developing world's utility markets. This lobbying appears to have worked. </p> <p>Speaking at an ESF conference in Brussels last Monday, Pascal Lamy, the EU Trade Commissioner, said: 'We are not demanding, or even provoking, privatisation or general deregulation [within the EU].

Indeed, I believe the Japanese, whose mastery of English is formidable, coined the phrase 'oil shock'. </p> <p>By the mid-Eighties, with the US suffering from a grossly overvalued dollar, and the so-called 'new economy' of information technology not yet fully exploited, there was much talk of US de-industrialisation. One of the City's leading bankers would ask in agonised puzzlement and admiration: 'How does Japan do it?'

      "bodyText": "One's outstanding memory of Japan in the Seventies was that it was seen as a terrifying economic powerhouse by the rest of the world, but the nation itself felt beleaguered and rather vulnerable. Its much-admired bureaucrats might have perfected an industrial strategy whose external consequences were seen in ever more upmarket and sophisticated exports (especially in cars and electronics); but the economy depended heavily on imported raw materials and oil, and was especially badly hit by the oil shocks of that decade. Indeed, I believe the Japanese, whose mastery of English is formidable, coined the phrase 'oil shock'. By the mid-Eighties, with the US suffering from a grossly overvalued dollar, and the so-called 'new economy' of information technology not yet fully exploited, there was much talk of US de-industrialisation. One of the City's leading bankers would ask in agonised puzzlement and admiration: 'How does Japan do it?' The US itself became terrified of Japanese industrial might. Then, in the immortal words of the Joseph Heller book title, Something Happened. With protectionist sentiment rising in the US, Washington initiated Group of Seven action to cut the dollar to more competitive levels; American capitalism finally triumphed over communism; and design faults appeared in the Japanese model. Japanese economic policy operated behind mysterious veils that few outsiders could understand. But it was always apparent that the industrial and internationally traded goods sectors were more efficient than the domestic service sector, and that somehow foreign firms found great difficulty in gaining footholds in Japan. The really big puzzle, however, was why price-earnings ratios on the Japanese stock market should have been at some three times the levels in London and on Wall Street, and why real estate in Tokyo should have been worth, on valuations then ruling, the equivalent of a fair proportion of the United States. The Japanese financial bubble of the Eighties made our own Lawson boom look like a vicarage tea party. The Bank of Japan eventually deflated the bubble; unfortunately, the bubble burst, as tends to happen with non-metaphorical bubbles. Japan spent most of the Nineties attempting to handle the consequences; and as we approach 2001 the attempt to put its 'balance sheet recession' behind it is still a major focus of concern here.

      "body": "<p>Brewer Carlsberg-Tetley has signalled strong interest in buying Carling Black Label in a deal that could value Britain's best-selling lager at around \u00a3750 million. </p> <p>Belgian drinks giant Interbrew fears it may be forced to sell Carling after its acquisition of the Bass and Whitbread breweries for a total of \u00a32.7 billion earlier this year. </p> <p>A Competition Commission report into the Bass deal, which gave Interbrew 32 per cent of the UK beer market, is due to land on Trade and Industry Secretary Stephen Byers' desk this week. </p> <p>According to industry sources, three of Bass and Whitbread's total of 10 breweries are vulnerable, putting thousands of jobs at risk in radical cost-cutting to justify the \u00a32.3bn price paid for Bass. </p> <p>The impending shake-up comes amid further upheaval in Britain's pubs and brewery industries. This weekend, German bank WestLB has snapped up 2,000 pubs belonging to Pubmaster, which used to be owned by Brent Walker. Another 6,000 pubs are also currently on the market. </p> <p>Midlands brewer Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley is understood to be talking to venture capital firm Candover about a \u00a3500m management buyout, City sources said. </p> <p>Interbrew, best known for Stella Artois lager, made its debut on the Belgian stock exchange last Friday, but the flotation has been overshadowed by regulatory worries. </p> <p>Until now, the firm has thought it might have to give up only its five-year contract to supply Bass and Whitbread pubs as the main price for buying Bass Brewing. Smaller brands, such as Tennents, Scotland's top-selling lager, might also be forced on the block, it has felt. </p> <p>But the DTI blocked Bass's purchase of Carlsberg-Tetley entirely in 1997 and, say several industry sources, Interbrew may have to sell Carling so that it can keep the rest of Bass. </p> <p>'Carling is emerging as the cleanest option,' one industry source said. 'Sale of Tennents would not address the situation in England and Wales. It is the combination of Carling and Stella Artois that gives Interbrew its power.' </p> <p>Carlsberg-Tetley, the number three UK brewer after Interbrew and Scottish Courage, came second in the race for Bass. It is, however, likely to face keen competition for Carling from Heineken and South African Breweries if Interbrew has to sell. </p> <p>This weekend the Danish-owned brewer declined to comment. However, one industry source said: 'Selling Carling to Carlsberg means the difference between a duopoly plus an also-ran or a viable, competitive industry with three strong players.' </p> <p>The three Bass breweries thought to be vulnerable following the Interbrew deal are Tadcaster, Alton and Birmingham. Interbrew declined to say whether it had ruled out brewery closures. </p> <p>Carling is produced at one of two Bass breweries in Burton, and could be hived off simply. A sale would be akin to Diageo's decision to sell Dewars, its top US scotch, to end regulatory strife following the merger of Guinness and Grand Metropolitan. </p> <p>Carling Black Label has 29 per cent of the UK volume lager market, Fosters 22 per cent, Carlsberg 13 per cent, Heineken 11 per cent and Tennents 7 per cent. Stella Artois is the leading premium lager, with a 30 per cent share.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Brewer Carlsberg-Tetley has signalled strong interest in buying Carling Black Label in a deal that could value Britain's best-selling lager at around \u00a3750 million. Belgian drinks giant Interbrew fears it may be forced to sell Carling after its acquisition of the Bass and Whitbread breweries for a total of \u00a32.7 billion earlier this year. A Competition Commission report into the Bass deal, which gave Interbrew 32 per cent of the UK beer market, is due to land on Trade and Industry Secretary Stephen Byers' desk this week. According to industry sources, three of Bass and Whitbread's total of 10 breweries are vulnerable, putting thousands of jobs at risk in radical cost-cutting to justify the \u00a32.3bn price paid for Bass. The impending shake-up comes amid further upheaval in Britain's pubs and brewery industries. This weekend, German bank WestLB has snapped up 2,000 pubs belonging to Pubmaster, which used to be owned by Brent Walker. Another 6,000 pubs are also currently on the market. Midlands brewer Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley is understood to be talking to venture capital firm Candover about a \u00a3500m management buyout, City sources said. Interbrew, best known for Stella Artois lager, made its debut on the Belgian stock exchange last Friday, but the flotation has been overshadowed by regulatory worries. Until now, the firm has thought it might have to give up only its five-year contract to supply Bass and Whitbread pubs as the main price for buying Bass Brewing. Smaller brands, such as Tennents, Scotland's top-selling lager, might also be forced on the block, it has felt. But the DTI blocked Bass's purchase of Carlsberg-Tetley entirely in 1997 and, say several industry sources, Interbrew may have to sell Carling so that it can keep the rest of Bass. 'Carling is emerging as the cleanest option,' one industry source said. 'Sale of Tennents would not address the situation in England and Wales. It is the combination of Carling and Stella Artois that gives Interbrew its power.' Carlsberg-Tetley, the number three UK brewer after Interbrew and Scottish Courage, came second in the race for Bass. It is, however, likely to face keen competition for Carling from Heineken and South African Breweries if Interbrew has to sell. This weekend the Danish-owned brewer declined to comment. However, one industry source said: 'Selling Carling to Carlsberg means the difference between a duopoly plus an also-ran or a viable, competitive industry with three strong players.' The three Bass breweries thought to be vulnerable following the Interbrew deal are Tadcaster, Alton and Birmingham. Interbrew declined to say whether it had ruled out brewery closures. Carling is produced at one of two Bass breweries in Burton, and could be hived off simply. A sale would be akin to Diageo's decision to sell Dewars, its top US scotch, to end regulatory strife following the merger of Guinness and Grand Metropolitan. Carling Black Label has 29 per cent of the UK volume lager market, Fosters 22 per cent, Carlsberg 13 per cent, Heineken 11 per cent and Tennents 7 per cent. Stella Artois is the leading premium lager, with a 30 per cent share.",

Even if you don't buy charity cards, the stamps on your festive greetings are helping someone. </p> <p>Last year, the Post Office gave nearly\u00a32 million of its profits to charity, making it one of the UK's biggest corporate donors. But sending cards isn't the only way you can help good causes without parting with extra cash: </p> <p> <strong> 1 Save your stamps</strong></p> <p> The cards you receive can do good, too. By selling sacks of used stamps to dealers, Blue Peter hopes to raise \u00a330,000 for its joint appeal with Health Unlimited. The money raised will be used to improve health care for communities in remote parts of the Andes. Send stamps to: Blue Peter Appeal 2000, PO Box 100, Liverpool L33 3BD. </p> <p>Other causes want used stamps, too, including Oxfam Trading, Murdoch Road, Bicester, OX26 4RF; the Royal National Institute for the Blind, PO Box 9191, Wishaw, ML2 0YB; and Save the Children, 17 Grove Lane, London SE5 8RD. </p> <p> <strong> 2 Print money</strong> </p> <p> Don't throw away your old printer cartridge, give it to the RNIB, which is aiming to raise\u00a330,000 from recycling both printer and fax-machine cartridges. </p> <p>For a supply of Freepost bags or labels for making donations, or details of free bulk collections for firms, phone 0800 781 2400. </p> <p> <strong> 3 Go cyber shopping</strong> </p> <p> If you are planning to do your Christmas shopping on the internet, visit a charitable shopping portal due to be launched tomorrow. The site, <a href=\"http://www.itsgoodtogive.com\">www.itsgoodtogive.com</a>, features more than 400 retailers. By sharing its advertising revenues and commission on purchases, it expects to raise \u00a38,000 a month for its partner charities. Other sites that divert a percentage from your pur chases to charity include: <a href=\"http://www.free2give.co.uk\">www.free2give.co.uk</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ushopugive.com\">www.ushopugive.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.moneytin.com\">www.moneytin.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.care4free.co.uk\">www.care4free.co.uk</a>. </p> <p> <strong> 4 Click to give</strong> </p> <p> Donate at the click of a mouse by visiting <a href=\"http://www.egiving.com\">www.egiving.com</a>, which raises money for ActionAid, Care, Oxfam and Save the Children. Choose a charity, click its button and the firm whose advertisement you are then shown will make a gift to your chosen cause. </p> <p> <strong> 5 Take the credit</strong> </p> <p> If every UK credit card-holder swapped their plastic for an affinity card that gives cash to charity, an extra \u00a3350m a year would reach worthy causes at no cost to the cardholders. So says Frizzell Bank which issues a card for the Cancer Research Campaign (0800 169 7799) and pays it 50p for every \u00a3100 spent . </p> <p>A similar amount is paid by Beneficial Bank (0800 161 162) on its United Nations Children's Fund card. And People's Bank pays a generous 60p to Comic Relief on every \u00a3100 spent on its Little Red Card (0800 056 9569). </p> <p> <strong> 6 Donate your debts</strong> </p> <p> With credit cards from the Cancer Research Campaign and Comic Relief, a sum similar to the amount paid to the charity on purchases is paid for every \u00a3100 of debt transferred to these cards. </p> <p>By switching a balance to plastic from the Co-operative Bank (0800 002 006) your debts help Amnesty International, Children's Aid Direct, Greenpeace, Help the Aged, Oxfam, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and Save the Children. </p> <p>HSBC pays a donation on debt to a range of causes with its Care Card (0800 130 130), and with one it issues for Shelter (020 7505 4699). </p> <p> <strong> 7 Give your bits</strong> </p> <p> Taking out a Donor 2000 card (0800 161 162) raises money for research and signifies a willingness to give organs. A Boots Advantage card can double as a donor card (tel 0845 0708090). </p> <p> <strong> 8 Part with your points</strong> </p> <p> Sainsbury's shoppers can turn each 500-point Reward loyalty voucher into \u00a32.50 for the NSPCC or the animal charity, Blue Cross. Ask at your local store. </p> <p> <strong> 9 Phone a friend</strong> </p> <p> Use a cut-price phone company that makes a donation whenever you make a call. Worldxchange (0800 980 9999) offers savings of between 24 and 43 per cent on calls, and gives Amnesty \u00a310 at first, followed by 2 per cent of national and 6 per cent of international call fees. Rival ACN gives 8 per cent of your bills to Re-cycle, which repairs bikes for the Third World (tel: 01206 382 207). </p> <p> <strong> 10 Give your time</strong> </p> <p> Crisis needs helpers for its national network of Christmas shelters from 23 to 30 December (020 7655 8312).</p>",

      "bodyText": "If you've been having Scrooge-like thoughts about the amount you've had to spend on Christmas cards and postage, it might cheer you up to know it's all in a good cause. Even if you don't buy charity cards, the stamps on your festive greetings are helping someone. Last year, the Post Office gave nearly\u00a32 million of its profits to charity, making it one of the UK's biggest corporate donors. But sending cards isn't the only way you can help good causes without parting with extra cash: 1 Save your stamps The cards you receive can do good, too. By selling sacks of used stamps to dealers, Blue Peter hopes to raise \u00a330,000 for its joint appeal with Health Unlimited. The money raised will be used to improve health care for communities in remote parts of the Andes. Send stamps to: Blue Peter Appeal 2000, PO Box 100, Liverpool L33 3BD. Other causes want used stamps, too, including Oxfam Trading, Murdoch Road, Bicester, OX26 4RF; the Royal National Institute for the Blind, PO Box 9191, Wishaw, ML2 0YB; and Save the Children, 17 Grove Lane, London SE5 8RD. 2 Print money Don't throw away your old printer cartridge, give it to the RNIB, which is aiming to raise\u00a330,000 from recycling both printer and fax-machine cartridges. For a supply of Freepost bags or labels for making donations, or details of free bulk collections for firms, phone 0800 781 2400. 3 Go cyber shopping If you are planning to do your Christmas shopping on the internet, visit a charitable shopping portal due to be launched tomorrow. The site, www.itsgoodtogive.com, features more than 400 retailers. By sharing its advertising revenues and commission on purchases, it expects to raise \u00a38,000 a month for its partner charities. Other sites that divert a percentage from your pur chases to charity include: www.free2give.co.uk, www.ushopugive.com, www.moneytin.com and www.care4free.co.uk. 4 Click to give Donate at the click of a mouse by visiting www.egiving.com, which raises money for ActionAid, Care, Oxfam and Save the Children. Choose a charity, click its button and the firm whose advertisement you are then shown will make a gift to your chosen cause. 5 Take the credit If every UK credit card-holder swapped their plastic for an affinity card that gives cash to charity, an extra \u00a3350m a year would reach worthy causes at no cost to the cardholders. So says Frizzell Bank which issues a card for the Cancer Research Campaign (0800 169 7799) and pays it 50p for every \u00a3100 spent . A similar amount is paid by Beneficial Bank (0800 161 162) on its United Nations Children's Fund card. And People's Bank pays a generous 60p to Comic Relief on every \u00a3100 spent on its Little Red Card (0800 056 9569). 6 Donate your debts With credit cards from the Cancer Research Campaign and Comic Relief, a sum similar to the amount paid to the charity on purchases is paid for every \u00a3100 of debt transferred to these cards. By switching a balance to plastic from the Co-operative Bank (0800 002 006) your debts help Amnesty International, Children's Aid Direct, Greenpeace, Help the Aged, Oxfam, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and Save the Children. HSBC pays a donation on debt to a range of causes with its Care Card (0800 130 130), and with one it issues for Shelter (020 7505 4699). 7 Give your bits Taking out a Donor 2000 card (0800 161 162) raises money for research and signifies a willingness to give organs. A Boots Advantage card can double as a donor card (tel 0845 0708090). 8 Part with your points Sainsbury's shoppers can turn each 500-point Reward loyalty voucher into \u00a32.50 for the NSPCC or the animal charity, Blue Cross. Ask at your local store. 9 Phone a friend Use a cut-price phone company that makes a donation whenever you make a call. Worldxchange (0800 980 9999) offers savings of between 24 and 43 per cent on calls, and gives Amnesty \u00a310 at first, followed by 2 per cent of national and 6 per cent of international call fees. Rival ACN gives 8 per cent of your bills to Re-cycle, which repairs bikes for the Third World (tel: 01206 382 207). 10 Give your time Crisis needs helpers for its national network of Christmas shelters from 23 to 30 December (020 7655 8312).",

The monthly interest rate is 6.58 per cent gross (5.26 per cent net), annual 6.78 per cent gross (5.42 per cent net), or 30 per cent (24 per cent net) if all taken on maturity. Annual interest is paid on 31 December each year. No withdrawals are allowed before 1 October 2001, no partial withdrawals are allowed thereafter and closure of the account will be subject to a penalty of 180 days' interest at 6.78 per cent gross. </p> <p><strong> Minimum: </strong> \u00a31,000 </p> <p><strong> Charges: </strong> Built into product. </p> <p><strong> Tax: </strong> Interest is paid net of basic rate income tax.

However, it's not really suitable for higher-rate taxpayers, who will end up paying another 20 per cent tax on the interest.' </p> <p>Colin Jackson, of Ilford firm Baronworth, says: 'If you are a non-taxpayer, this is the best fixed rate you are going to get over four years. But as a basic-rate taxpayer with \u00a340,000 to invest, you can get 5.46 per cent net a year or 5.32 per cent net monthly from AIG.' </p> <p><strong> Points out of 10: </strong> Wicks - 7, Jackson - 7.</p>",

Bells &amp; whistles: Designed to celebrate the society's 130th anniversary, this bond offers the best return in its class according to MoneyFacts magazine. How it works: Interest can be paid monthly, annually or all on maturity after four years. The monthly interest rate is 6.58 per cent gross (5.26 per cent net), annual 6.78 per cent gross (5.42 per cent net), or 30 per cent (24 per cent net) if all taken on maturity. Annual interest is paid on 31 December each year. No withdrawals are allowed before 1 October 2001, no partial withdrawals are allowed thereafter and closure of the account will be subject to a penalty of 180 days' interest at 6.78 per cent gross. Minimum: \u00a31,000 Charges: Built into product. Tax: Interest is paid net of basic rate income tax. Non-taxpayers can register to have interest paid gross. Risk: None. Should you invest? Chris Wicks, of Glossop independent financial adviser Bridgewater Financial Planning, says: 'It's very good as these sort of things go, and is offering the best interest rate for this time period (although some variable rate Isas beat it). However, it's not really suitable for higher-rate taxpayers, who will end up paying another 20 per cent tax on the interest.' Colin Jackson, of Ilford firm Baronworth, says: 'If you are a non-taxpayer, this is the best fixed rate you are going to get over four years. But as a basic-rate taxpayer with \u00a340,000 to invest, you can get 5.46 per cent net a year or 5.32 per cent net monthly from AIG.' Points out of 10: Wicks - 7, Jackson - 7.",

This is where William Walker gets involved. Since he established a dog rescue centre for Staffordshire Bull Terriers seven years ago, he collects abandoned dogs that would otherwise be put down. </p> <p>'Over the last 12 months, I have found new homes for 300 dogs,' he says proudly. Demand for his services has mushroomed since he started running training sessions for problem dogs, of all breeds, two years ago. 'What started as a hobby is taking up more and more of my time,' he says. </p> <p>Together with others he has set up a group called the Friends of Staffordshire Bull Terriers. Donations from the new owners of rescue dogs and for the training sessions go into a special bank account with a view to buying land and setting up a rescue and training centre. </p> <p>'If we can get the centre up and running, there is a possibility I could be a trainer manager,' says William. </p> <p>Whether this is affordable partly depends on the donated money generating enough interest to pay him a wage. The fund now stands at around \u00a330,000, though he is hoping it will reach \u00a3100,000 in the next few years. He is unsure whether to make the centre a business or a charity, and is reluctant to seek legal advice because of the expense. </p> <p>Meanwhile, he is making his living as a night-worker for Sainsbury's, and still works from time to time as a self-employed bricklayer which was his previous employment. He does not see himself retiring as he prefers to keep occupied, though he would like to set up some kind of a pension. </p> <p>He puts most of his savings into staff-discounted Sainsbury's shares. He has a plot in Lincolnshire where he intends to build a retirement bungalow. He has no mortgage as he lives with friends. </p> <p>He saves \u00a325 a month for his four-year-old daughter, Lucy, in a tax-free friendly society plan. Lucy also has money invested on her behalf in National Savings Children's Bonus Bonds which will reach the end of their five-year term next year. </p> <p>He wants to have money for when she is 18.'I work alongside students at Sainsbury's. They seem to be very hard up,' he says. </p> <p>\u0095 For further information, call 01865 3755210 or go to <a href=\"http://www.fosbt.co.uk\">www.fosbt.co.uk</a></p> <p><strong>Adviser 1: Andrew Jones</strong></p> <p>William's dog centre has reached the size where a more formal structure is needed. As its income consists solely of donations, I suggest charitable status may be most appropriate. </p> <p>This will enable its cash reserves to be invested without the need to pay tax on the returns. William will be able to pay himself a 'reasonable' salary and claim expenses.</p> <p>He should apply to the Charities Commission (telephone: 0870 333 0123) for a starter pack, giving advice on setting up and registering a charity. He will need a solicitor to help draft its constitution.</p> <p>Although William is not anxious to retire, his greatest problem in the coming years will not be his willingness to continue working, but his ability. If his health were to failed he might not be able to do so. I recommend is that he applies to the DSS for a forecast of the level of state pension he can expect at 65 and whether there is scope for him to make additional contributions. He needs to complete form BR19, which can be obtained from larger post offices or benefits offices, and send it to the DSS.</p> <p>As William has left his pension planning so late, I am not certain that beginning contributions now will be worthwhile. Instead, I recommend he saves as much as possible in Individual Savings Accounts to create the largest possible fund for retirement or ill health.</p> <p><strong>Adviser 2: Gillian Cardy</strong></p> <p>He really must see a lawyer to make sure the dog centre is set up properly. This will involve some expense, but it is better than setting it up incorrectly and then finding he cannot make the best use of the funds. </p> <p>William should not invest the donations until he is sure he is not overstepping his powers. Donors will not be happy if he does anything to cut the money available for the dogs he clearly cares about.</p> <p>On the pensions front, if Sainsbury's is offering an employer's scheme and the possibility of the firm making contributions this is likely to be better value than a stakeholder scheme in his own name. If William has made very little pension provision he may be one of those who will benefit from the new minimum income guarantee in retirement, and who may also benefit from the pensioner's credit which aims not to penalise those who make some provision of their own. I would therefore be cautious about putting too much into pensions now, though doing so should take higher priority than building up Sainsbury's shares.</p> <p>As far as his daughter is concerned, if he prefers an account with instant access then Nationwide's Smart 2 Save account offers one of the best interest rates at 6.95 per cent. But he may want to consider an Isa which would have to be in his name. </p> <p>Gillian Cardy works for financial adviser Professional Partnerships. </p> <p>\u0095 Advice is for guidance only.

Demand for his services has mushroomed since he started running training sessions for problem dogs, of all breeds, two years ago. 'What started as a hobby is taking up more and more of my time,' he says. Together with others he has set up a group called the Friends of Staffordshire Bull Terriers. Donations from the new owners of rescue dogs and for the training sessions go into a special bank account with a view to buying land and setting up a rescue and training centre. 'If we can get the centre up and running, there is a possibility I could be a trainer manager,' says William. Whether this is affordable partly depends on the donated money generating enough interest to pay him a wage. The fund now stands at around \u00a330,000, though he is hoping it will reach \u00a3100,000 in the next few years. He is unsure whether to make the centre a business or a charity, and is reluctant to seek legal advice because of the expense. Meanwhile, he is making his living as a night-worker for Sainsbury's, and still works from time to time as a self-employed bricklayer which was his previous employment. He does not see himself retiring as he prefers to keep occupied, though he would like to set up some kind of a pension. He puts most of his savings into staff-discounted Sainsbury's shares. He has a plot in Lincolnshire where he intends to build a retirement bungalow. He has no mortgage as he lives with friends. He saves \u00a325 a month for his four-year-old daughter, Lucy, in a tax-free friendly society plan. Lucy also has money invested on her behalf in National Savings Children's Bonus Bonds which will reach the end of their five-year term next year. He wants to have money for when she is 18.'I work alongside students at Sainsbury's. They seem to be very hard up,' he says. \u0095 For further information, call 01865 3755210 or go to www.fosbt.co.uk Adviser 1: Andrew Jones William's dog centre has reached the size where a more formal structure is needed. As its income consists solely of donations, I suggest charitable status may be most appropriate. This will enable its cash reserves to be invested without the need to pay tax on the returns. William will be able to pay himself a 'reasonable' salary and claim expenses. He should apply to the Charities Commission (telephone: 0870 333 0123) for a starter pack, giving advice on setting up and registering a charity. He will need a solicitor to help draft its constitution. Although William is not anxious to retire, his greatest problem in the coming years will not be his willingness to continue working, but his ability. If his health were to failed he might not be able to do so. I recommend is that he applies to the DSS for a forecast of the level of state pension he can expect at 65 and whether there is scope for him to make additional contributions. He needs to complete form BR19, which can be obtained from larger post offices or benefits offices, and send it to the DSS. As William has left his pension planning so late, I am not certain that beginning contributions now will be worthwhile. Instead, I recommend he saves as much as possible in Individual Savings Accounts to create the largest possible fund for retirement or ill health. Adviser 2: Gillian Cardy He really must see a lawyer to make sure the dog centre is set up properly. This will involve some expense, but it is better than setting it up incorrectly and then finding he cannot make the best use of the funds. William should not invest the donations until he is sure he is not overstepping his powers. Donors will not be happy if he does anything to cut the money available for the dogs he clearly cares about. On the pensions front, if Sainsbury's is offering an employer's scheme and the possibility of the firm making contributions this is likely to be better value than a stakeholder scheme in his own name. If William has made very little pension provision he may be one of those who will benefit from the new minimum income guarantee in retirement, and who may also benefit from the pensioner's credit which aims not to penalise those who make some provision of their own. I would therefore be cautious about putting too much into pensions now, though doing so should take higher priority than building up Sainsbury's shares. As far as his daughter is concerned, if he prefers an account with instant access then Nationwide's Smart 2 Save account offers one of the best interest rates at 6.95 per cent. But he may want to consider an Isa which would have to be in his name. Gillian Cardy works for financial adviser Professional Partnerships. \u0095 Advice is for guidance only.

Dividing the spoils in a household may be only part of the problem that a couple faces in developing a harmonious approach to money. Men and women tend to have different attitudes to spending and investment. </p> <p>This is no surprise to Donna Bradshaw, a director at the all-female independent financial adviser, Fiona Price &amp; Partners. 'Men are short-termist and speculative, and think they know more about money than they actually do, whereas women actually know more than they think,' she says. </p> <p>Bradshaw has noticed that when couples go in together for advice, 'although there are not huge arguments, there are differences. Women tend to be more averse to risk and might stick to deposit accounts, but once they learn about risk and time they become more confident.' </p> <p>Having taken the plunge, studies have shown that women investors go on to outperform their male counterparts. 'Women take a longer-term view and, through staying with it, they avoid charges and the dangers of moving in and out [of investments] at the wrong time,' says Bradshaw. </p> <p>Although women have proven that they can be good financial managers, often they lack confidence. 'The \"me hunter, you stay at home and cook dinner\" attitude goes back to our childhood,' says Bradshaw. It is unlikely to disappear overnight. </p> <p>Psychologist and author Dorothy Rowe says: 'Men regard money as the perfect vehicle for recognition of their status as a winner, whereas women use it in a way to help them be secure as a person - say in the way they dress.' </p> <p>It is difficult to get away from the myths and generalisations. Studies across the world have shown that women have less confidence in their financial ability, and tend to avoid making decisions for fear of making a mistake. Women feel entitled to less pay and are prepared to restrict their own spending in the interests of the family; they are less prepared for retirement, and are more likely to spend their old age in poverty; more men than women want to be rich; women like to shop more than men. </p> <p>Rowe believes that women suffer from 'the cost of ignorance', which stems from a belief that being financially responsible is not seen as being feminine. </p> <p>This is compounded by the fear identified by psychologist Sonya Friedman that the more competent a woman is financially, the less anyone else will want to take care of her. So it is no surprise that women's relationship with money is often more ambiguous than men's. </p> <p>Different too are the raw emotions aroused by merely thinking about filthy lucre. More women than men have been shown to associate anxiety, depression, anger and helplessness with money, while more men associate it with feelings of happiness and excitement. </p> <p>Rowe says that many differences are down to men's competitive instincts, which are encouraged from a young age. 'Competition is all, it's the way boys are brought up and educated,' she says. 'Women don't regard competition in the same way.' </p> <p>Carole Burgoyne, a psychologist at Exeter University, has studied how couples organise and use money in marriage. She says that among couples at low-income levels, the women are seen as having more financial skills, and so may get the 'burden' of having to make ends meet when there is not much money. But 'at higher income levels, the men are seen as having more financial expertise, and are more likely to have overall control and make decisions on investments'. </p> <p>Stephen Holloway of independent financial adviser John Holt &amp; Partners in Reading agrees that the distinction between men and women is not always clear-cut. He says that the person with the more active interest in money tends to take more financial risk. 'Often it is the man, but often it is more an age thing. With people of retirement age women do as the husbands say,' he says. </p> <p>However he has noticed that women are often better-prepared when dealing with the financial services industry. 'Women have often done more reading up and are more knowledgeable than their other half,' he says. </p> <p>With younger professional women the edges between the sexes can become very blurred. 'They had to get there the hard way, and can even be a bit more aggressive.' </p> <p>But to see how far women have yet to go to confound the stereotypes about their relationship with money, look no further than the high street this Christmas. 'Compulsive shopping is more common among women,' says Burgoyne. 'Men with a compulsive disorder may find other ways of expressing their compulsive behaviours.' Or as Donna Bradshaw says:'Men treat themselves to big objects such as cars, women shop for comfort.' For women trying to take a more sensible approach to finances, that provides little comfort at all.</p> <p><strong>Chalk and cheese - but a joint account</strong></p> <p>Emma and Damien are both thirtysomething high flyers.

Psychologist and author Dorothy Rowe says: 'Men regard money as the perfect vehicle for recognition of their status as a winner, whereas women use it in a way to help them be secure as a person - say in the way they dress.' It is difficult to get away from the myths and generalisations. Studies across the world have shown that women have less confidence in their financial ability, and tend to avoid making decisions for fear of making a mistake. Women feel entitled to less pay and are prepared to restrict their own spending in the interests of the family; they are less prepared for retirement, and are more likely to spend their old age in poverty; more men than women want to be rich; women like to shop more than men. Rowe believes that women suffer from 'the cost of ignorance', which stems from a belief that being financially responsible is not seen as being feminine. This is compounded by the fear identified by psychologist Sonya Friedman that the more competent a woman is financially, the less anyone else will want to take care of her. So it is no surprise that women's relationship with money is often more ambiguous than men's. Different too are the raw emotions aroused by merely thinking about filthy lucre. More women than men have been shown to associate anxiety, depression, anger and helplessness with money, while more men associate it with feelings of happiness and excitement. Rowe says that many differences are down to men's competitive instincts, which are encouraged from a young age. 'Competition is all, it's the way boys are brought up and educated,' she says. 'Women don't regard competition in the same way.' Carole Burgoyne, a psychologist at Exeter University, has studied how couples organise and use money in marriage. She says that among couples at low-income levels, the women are seen as having more financial skills, and so may get the 'burden' of having to make ends meet when there is not much money. But 'at higher income levels, the men are seen as having more financial expertise, and are more likely to have overall control and make decisions on investments'. Stephen Holloway of independent financial adviser John Holt &amp; Partners in Reading agrees that the distinction between men and women is not always clear-cut. He says that the person with the more active interest in money tends to take more financial risk. 'Often it is the man, but often it is more an age thing. With people of retirement age women do as the husbands say,' he says. However he has noticed that women are often better-prepared when dealing with the financial services industry. 'Women have often done more reading up and are more knowledgeable than their other half,' he says. With younger professional women the edges between the sexes can become very blurred. 'They had to get there the hard way, and can even be a bit more aggressive.' But to see how far women have yet to go to confound the stereotypes about their relationship with money, look no further than the high street this Christmas. 'Compulsive shopping is more common among women,' says Burgoyne. 'Men with a compulsive disorder may find other ways of expressing their compulsive behaviours.' Or as Donna Bradshaw says:'Men treat themselves to big objects such as cars, women shop for comfort.' For women trying to take a more sensible approach to finances, that provides little comfort at all. Chalk and cheese - but a joint account Emma and Damien are both thirtysomething high flyers. Damien is a solicitor while Emma sells advertising space. Their incomes are roughly the same. They have a mortgage and are hoping to move to a larger property. A year of marriage has taught them that a joint bank account is the best way to deal with day-to-day bills as money management could easily become a source of disputes. 'Everything gets split down the middle that way,' says Emma. 'It's just as well because Damien's very good at managing finances and I'm not.' Squabbles occasionally arise over who should pay the cleaner as she needs to be paid in cash but Emma concedes that Damien usually ends up paying. Both Emma and Damien invest equally and they rarely take risks with their money, preferring an Isa to dabbling directly in the stock market. But both have pensions. According to Emma, Damien never gets into debt. 'He saves while I just load my credit cards to the hilt. He sometimes gets quite frustrated with me,' she sighs. 'I don't really know where it all goes.' \u0095 Names have been changed",

Financial matters were something my dad looked after, and the rest of us - my mother included - didn't need to trouble ourselves. </p> <p>A generation on, and the tables have definitely turned. My husband couldn't tell you which Isas we invest in, how much money we have in the building society or how much school fees - should we need to pay them - would set us back, but I can. Because, added to the endless list of services already provided by the mother of the house (chauffeur, diary-keeper, household manager, shopper, cook, clothes buyer... ) is a new role: family accountant.

What I object to, and I suspect other women do, too, is the sheer detail these companies send when you put in a request for more details of this Isa or that.

She knows that time is valuable, and that it isn't worth phoning every last dealer. Women are more able to cut through the jargon, to see what matters. They want to find one thing that's OK and then move on. They haven't got time to compare everything and then make a decision. Men make financial matters into a hobby and read up on everything - women just get it done as quickly as possible so they can get on with the rest of their lives.' </p> <p>Gollner isn't surprised by Family Assurance's findings on the growing importance of women's role in financial purchases. 'Historically women were the budget keepers - in working class households during the last century you'd have a man coming home with his wage packet and handing it over to his wife, who'd give him his allowance and then pay the bills and balance the budget with the rest,' he points out. </p> <p>'For a while, middle-class men took on the role of money-management when there were servants to be paid and so on, but it's not surprising that the situation is now reversing.

      "body": "<p>Ugh, what is this ugly floppy object slumping on my desk? A design book, I might have guessed - General Knowledge by Stephen Bayley. You can tell it is a design book by its confused typography, hideous shiny coloured pages, and gormless cover with a huge ISBN number and no price. In other words, a book designed by someone unfamiliar with reading for people who have no desire to read. The blurb confirms the worst - ' General Knowledge is destined to become a cult object in its own right.' Precisely. Just as the Cargo Cult islanders of the Pacific worship whatever detritus of western civilisation washes up on their beaches, so this book is destined to be worshipped by primitive folk who, never having seen a book before, will squeal with wonder at its brightly coloured pages and place it on one of their totems by way of a hat. </p> <p>The author is Stephen Bayley, the 'design guru' who founded the Design Museum with Terence Conran, and who briefly surfaced as a creative director of the Dome before flouncing out. The book, besides being a cult object, is a collection of his journalism over the years and, when I stopped gnashing my teeth over the paper and typography, I quite enjoyed reading it - he has a sharp and waspish turn of phrase, and obviously a completely besotted devotion to his subject. He thinks design is more important than art, more important than everything . He thinks a Braun hairdryer is a higher testament to human achievement than Shakespeare's plays or Rembrandt's self-portraits. He thinks the future of civilisation hangs on our ability to design a better teapot. In other words, he is bonkers but quite readably bonkers. </p> <p>My problem with design-worship is I can never quite decide whether merely to dislike it or passionately disapprove of it. Should I put it in the category of activities like morris dancing, which I would never want to do myself but can't seriously object to other people doing, or should I put it in the category of, say, telephone cold-calling where I would favour life imprisonment for everyone involved? The latter seems a bit extreme. One can't really be against good design, in fact one might, on the whole, be quite in favour of it. It is the people who worship it - the Stephen Bayleys - who are the problem. </p> <p>They are not so obtrusive as they were in the 80s but there are still enough of them around to constitute a serious irritation. I recognised that there was something badly wrong with their values many years ago when they all decided that the Olivetti Lettera was the best typewriter ever made. It was certainly the prettiest typewriter ever made. It was lipstick pink and looked gorgeous in photographs. The only drawback arose if you ever wanted to type on it. It was soggy as a damp washrag and jammed every three seconds. It would have been quicker to engrave letters in marble. But, of course, the Lettera was a cult object, much worshipped by people who admired typewriters but didn't intend to type. </p> <p>Where was I? Oh yes, going to meet Stephen Bayley at his home in the Oval. The house looks fine from the outside - standard- issue mid-Victorian with no obvious signs of design-guru occupancy. He comes bounding to the door, eager, friendly, apologising for the fact that he is holding a joss stick (I never find out why - neither why he is holding it nor why he is apologising.) At 49, he is still handsome, despite having a cast in one eye, and is wearing what look to me like reasonably normal clothes - a grey suit with turn-ups, a black poloneck sweater underneath - though later he tells me the suit is by David Chambers, the sweater by John Smedley and the shoes by JM Weston of Paris, which presumably means they are some sort of style statement. </p> <p>He leads me through the house - a colourless vista of coir matting and white slip- covered chairs - to the semi-basement which is the usual kitchen-cum-dining room arrangement but, of course, immaculate. There are three shelves running the length of the room with a careful array of objects - two portrait heads of his children, a bas-relief of locusts, a row of bottles, a row of glasses, a pile of white church candles. The principle seems to be the same as the old Habitat formula - ordinary things look more exciting if you have lots of them together. </p> <p>He makes coffee in a perfect cafetiere and serves it in perfect white porcelain cups. Meanwhile, he hands me a book by David Linley called Design and Detail in the Home which he says will give me some 'background' on the shelves. I stare at the illustrations of his shelves, and stare at the shelves, but fail to grasp the point until he tells me - they are postmodern shelves! 'They've been here too long now, but they were nicely ironic \"postmodern\" - and if you quote me on that you have got to put postmodern in inverted commas. They were done for us by an architect called Peter Wadley - you must credit the poor duck - who, for reasons probably best known to his therapist, wanted them to look like toothpicks. They had to use some incredibly complicated computer cutting machine to make them taper like that. And they're hollow, I mean just unfathomably complicated!' Originally, the shelves went right through the fireplace as if skewering it, but when they lit a fire, the shelves got burned. The world of a design guru must be full of such surprises. </p> <p>Actually, he says, the house is more his wife's creation than his own. He met Flo when they were both working for Terence Conran in the early 80s. He knew he had met Ms Right when he noticed that she always drank her coffee from a chunky French Apilco coffee cup and grew pots of basil on the balcony. 'And this was when I was still wearing a leather jacket and cowboy boots, and had a bad haircut and a Ford Capri! So the truth is I'm the result of a great deal of styling from Flo - she may not be pleased with the attribution, but a lot of what is associated with me is in fact her inspiration.' </p> <p>He decided to marry Flo within weeks of meeting her. 'I mean I'm an absolute slave to the look of things and the fact that I'd met someone who actually shared at least 95 per cent of my taste was immensely significant. She's also very interested in food which I've always been.' She now works as a cookery-book illustrator. They have two children, Bruno, 15, and Coco, 13, who live on the top floor and are allowed to make a mess upstairs, but not down. </p> <p>After we have been talking for about 10 minutes, the lights flicker and go off. It doesn't really matter because there is daylight, and we already have our coffee, but Bayley goes into paroxysms of rage. 'Oh this is a nightmare! It's like being in Kinshasa! It now means I have to re-set seven different machines. I wouldn't mind someone lobbing hand grenades at me, but having to reset the timer on the video recorder puts me into a blood-spitting frenzy.' Luckily, the lights come on again in half a minute, but meanwhile a burglar alarm has started wailing and he dashes about, literally tearing his hair, until it stops. I realise that what I thought of as his rather manic manner beforehand was as nothing to his manic manner when things upset him. He couldn't have been more distraught if the house had been bombed. </p> <p>He keens with grief and says that everything is going wrong. For instance, he says, he had prepared a great opening speech for me, but then I arrived two minutes early and he forgot. 'Do it now,' I say kindly. 'Well, he begins, \"I was going to tell you I'd been playing tennis this morning, but I played very badly. So - I was going to say - \"I'm easy meat for you because I've just been thrashed on the tennis court and I'm demoralised.\" Then I would have given you the gloss on that, because I would have said, \"It's very typical of me to say two things in one sentence which, in this case, is a) I'm very smart because I play tennis on Friday mornings and b) I'm appealing to your sympathy because I was humiliated.\" Because, I mean, with someone like me talking to someone like you, the amount of potential for bluff and double bluff is limitless. But then you arrived two minutes early and I was still holding the joss stick!' </p> <p>Crikey. He prepared all that spiel and I probably wouldn't even have noticed. But it is a good example of how he thinks. He imagines that every conversation is a contest, and that every opponent is as 'aware' as he is, and thinks in the same point-scoring, convoluted, self-conscious way. But actually he is like a chess champion playing against himself - he is playing this brilliant game which he, and really only he, is equipped to appreciate. </p> <p>He calls himself 'a completely self-invented creature' and it is obvious that his persona has undergone a great deal of restyling. For instance, he grew up in Liverpool, but has no trace of a Liverpool accent. You would imagine that he went to public school and Oxbridge - in fact, he went to state school and Manchester University. He actually went to Quarry Bank, but when I say 'John Lennon's old school!' he says, 'Yes - and Derek Nimmo's.' He came from a comfortable but not affluent home - his father was a manager in an aircraft-components factory. His father was also resolutely philistine, but they always had 'interesting' cars and spent a lot of time polishing them. </p> <p>Bayley's teenage ambition was to be an architect, but his maths was not good enough so he went for the soft option, art history, instead. He was astute enough to realise that if you wanted to be an expert in, say, the Renaissance, you faced a lifetime's reading, whereas in those days if you wanted to be an expert in 20th-century design you could read all the literature in a long weekend. So he made himself an expert and became a lecturer at the Open University, and then at the University of Kent. </p> <p>He loved lecturing because it was showing off, but he hated straightforward teaching or giving seminars. Nevertheless he thought his destiny was to be an academic and was poised to become professor of design at the University of Salford when Terence Conran plucked him from provincial obscurity and flung him into metropolitan fame. </p> <p>Conran had just made a fortune by floating Habitat and put some of the proceeds into a charitable trust to promote design. A friend recommended Bayley as a possible adjutant and together they planned the Boilerhouse Project, a hugely successful programme of exhibitions at the V&amp;A from 1982 to 1986. For a while, the Boilerhouse was the most popular gallery in London - one year it drew more visitors than the V&amp;A itself. But it was always a rather fishy mix of the commercial and the curatorial - so many of the exhibitions looked like product placements. It was very 'of its time', perfectly in tune with the neophiliac, label-worshipping heyday of Thatcherism. </p> <p>In 1989, Bayley and Conran opened their very own purpose-built Design Museum in Docklands. For Bayley, as director, it was the culmination of everything he aspired to - physical proof that design was as important as art. But weirdly, no sooner had it opened, than he resigned. The trigger was a meeting with the chairman of the trustees who told him that now the museum was up and running, he must stop giving interviews and going on television, and settle down and run it. Bayley, in his own words, flounced out in 'an existential funk'. He still doesn't really know why, except that 'I wasn't getting on with a lot of people and I was really very, very tired. I didn't fall out with Terence, but I was a bit cross with him for not supporting me. There was a time when I was getting slightly more press than Terence and, because we are in many ways very similar, it's not difficult to see how that might have riled him.' </p> <p>He and Conran remain friends and Bayley is happy to call himself 'a poor man's Terence Conran'. But without his crucial mentor, he found himself adrift. 'That's one of the things about getting older isn't it? You suddenly realise that you are what you set out to be. And there are no role models any more.' </p> <p>He once told journalist Ann Barr that he was very ambitious - but ambitious without a purpose. 'I have a character failing. I am quite incapable of identifying with anything whole-heartedly. Whatever I am doing, I am always planning to do something else. I would rather travel than arrive.' </p> <p>So arriving at the Design Museum sent him into his existential funk. 'I had actually spent 10 years working on it and it was what I'd always wanted. Finally, I'd created an arena for myself and for my interests. So to have spent all that time crawling to the top of the pile - a pile which I'd invented myself - and then walk away... I was very unhappy. But there's that strange thing - by the time I was 37 I'd sort of done everything I thought I was going to do.' </p> <p>He has never really found his focus since. He set up a little company, Eye-Q, which he still runs, which is basically him doing odd bits of journalism and design consultancy. He is currently planning an exhibition about the cultural history of pasta for the Estorick Collection, and is consultant for a design academy Ford Motors is building in Soho. But in May 1997, when someone at Saatchi asked if he'd like to be creative director of the Dome, he was happy to drop everything. </p> <p>'I couldn't not be flattered by being asked and also I am very vain and ambitious - though ambitious for what I'm never sure. I'm not quite sure what I want any more.' He told the press that the job was 'what I was invented for'. The money wasn't bad either - \u00a380,000 a year for three days a week. But almost immediately he ran into problems and found the whole organisation 'utterly scary'. He thought Peter Mandelson would be a soulmate, but Mandelson didn't want to know. When Bayley floated his wizard wheezes - let's get Bill Gates involved, let's consult Susan Sontag and Nicholas Negroponte of MIT, let's have Richard Dawkins to advise us on the Faith Zone - Mandelson flatly said 'no'. He didn't want 'the best brains in the world,' he wanted British brains. And, above all, he wanted the Dome to be popular which was not part of Bayley's thinking at all. </p> <p>Bayley finally resigned when Mandelson made his well-publicised pilgrimage to Disneyland in January 1998. For him it was the last straw, as he told the press, 'If Mandy went down to a voodoo sacrifice in Brixton tonight he'd come back tomorrow saying, \"We must have voodoo sacrifices in the Dome.\"' A National Millennium Experience Commission mole countered that Bayley had 'become an embarrassment... He was the sort of person who had tantrums and threatened to resign several times.' Bayley recently told Esquire , 'I wouldn't go so far as to say my feud with Mandelson is an expression of frustrated love...' but that is what it sounds like. He has seen Mandelson once since the Dome, when he was lunching in a restaurant with David and Serena Linley and Mandelson walked in 'with two rather lugubrious looking youths, who didn't look as if they were officials from the Northern Ireland office', but the pair studiously ignored each other. </p> <p>Bayley admits that there was an anxious period between his leaving the Dome and the Dome opening when he thought, 'Oh, shit, if it turns out all right, I'll never work again.' But, luckily, it was a disaster and he watched the opening ceremony on television 'the way you can't take your eyes off a car crash'. He visited the Dome only once, for The Daily Telegraph , and basked in an orgy of 'I told you sos'. But when he thinks about what might have been, and how he and Mandelson could have created something wonderful together, 'it makes my teeth ache. I'm thinking of going on a vast hypnotherapy course to stop me thinking about the Dome ever again.' </p> <p>Now, oddly, he is proposing to throw himself to the lions again - he wants to succeed Alan Borg as director of the V&amp;A. He says he could be the creative director and they could have some more ordinary mortal to do the administration. He thinks the V&amp;A should 'merchandise' itself more. 'I mean museums and department stores were created at exactly the same moment in European history in about 1850 and they are both the expression of the same belief system. I'm not saying I would try to turn the V&amp;A into a shop, but you can do both . You can maintain a superb scholarship and you can make money out of design consultancy and merchandising. I mean you've got fantastic experts in furniture, decoration, fashion - curators don't have to sit around in fusty studies all the time.' </p> <p>So how far has his candidacy actually got? He claims that 'sources close to the V&amp;A' encouraged him to stand, and he saw the head-hunters in August 'and did an absolute bravura display of silliness', but hasn't heard a word since. Typically, he prefaced his application by writing an article for The Independent which even he calls 'a suicide note' in which he described the V&amp;A trustees as 'cheesy placemen'. Not surprisingly, the cheesy placemen haven't invited him for interview. 'Oh they're not going to give it me,' he admits in an odd flash of realism, 'because I'm too noisy, I'm too restless and I'm too provocative. But if they want someone like me there's no one better!' </p> <p>Pigs might fly, of course, but I would guess he is unlikely to get the V&amp;A. Luckily he has plan B, which is to start a business, somewhere between advertising, design consultancy and public relations. 'Because for good or for bad, my name is very well known and if you're known as a \"design guru\" - please preserve the irony - you may as well trade on it, instead of just taking phone calls from World at One asking for your comment on the new lion house at Dunstable Zoo. So I think it may be time to properly exploit my knowledge and notoriety. While I haven't been exactly in hibernation since the Design Museum, I haven't totally focused on anything really, and I think it may be time to focus myself now.' </p> <p>He turns 50 next year, so it seems a good moment. He is, as he says, totally, passionately, eternally committed to good design but he recognises that this enthusiasm is not widely shared. 'It's one of the many things which causes pain and misery in my life because I can't believe that other people don't care. I mean I don't want to speak ill of the late-lamented Donald Dewar, but his clothes! I just don't understand how you can not be concerned about your appearance. From time to time I'm vilified as the person who cares about the look of a teapot - and it's not that I believe my taste is superior , I just can not believe that other people don't care. But why I'm quite pleased with my book is that it does show that I was interested in these things long before it became fashionable and I promise you I will still be interested in it afterwards - it is a genuine perversion or whatever you want to call it, it is not a momentary thing.' </p> <p>I believe him. But I also believe that there is something unbalanced about worshipping appearance as much as he does. In General Knowledge , Bayley reprints an article he wrote in 1991, about the cars museum directors drive, in the course of which he says that he once saw Nicholas Serota driving a Volvo 340 and could never take the Turner Prize seriously again. And yet he says now that he deeply admires Tate Modern, so doesn't he see that he was wrong to write Serota off purely because he drove the wrong car? 'No. I believe in Corbusier's definition, that design is intelligence made visible. And if you are someone like me, suffering from my delusions, you believe there is no such thing as an innocent gesture. Everything we do, wear, buy - or everything we reject - says something about us. That's part of the fascination of the modern world - there's no such thing as innocent choice. So Nick and his Volvo 340 is significant. Because how can you have a fine eye and not want to apply it to everything? He is supposed to be the leading national spokesman for modernism. And yet he can suspend his judgement enough to drive a crap heap, one of the worst machines ever made. And if you think art is very important how can you drive a Volvo 340?' </p> <p>At the end of our conversation, Bayley insists on walking me to my car. I wish, wish, wish it were a Volvo 340, but I am confident that my Mondeo will have the same effect. Unfortunately, it doesn't - the Mondeo for some weird reason comes within his definition of approved design. So, Nick Serota, if you are reading this - trade down, swop your Volvo for a Mondeo and you can earn the admiration of a Stephen Bayley. But I am inclined to think that, having built Tate Modern, you don't really need to bother. Let those who worship the teapot live by the teapot.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ugh, what is this ugly floppy object slumping on my desk? A design book, I might have guessed - General Knowledge by Stephen Bayley. You can tell it is a design book by its confused typography, hideous shiny coloured pages, and gormless cover with a huge ISBN number and no price. In other words, a book designed by someone unfamiliar with reading for people who have no desire to read. The blurb confirms the worst - ' General Knowledge is destined to become a cult object in its own right.' Precisely. Just as the Cargo Cult islanders of the Pacific worship whatever detritus of western civilisation washes up on their beaches, so this book is destined to be worshipped by primitive folk who, never having seen a book before, will squeal with wonder at its brightly coloured pages and place it on one of their totems by way of a hat. The author is Stephen Bayley, the 'design guru' who founded the Design Museum with Terence Conran, and who briefly surfaced as a creative director of the Dome before flouncing out. The book, besides being a cult object, is a collection of his journalism over the years and, when I stopped gnashing my teeth over the paper and typography, I quite enjoyed reading it - he has a sharp and waspish turn of phrase, and obviously a completely besotted devotion to his subject. He thinks design is more important than art, more important than everything . He thinks a Braun hairdryer is a higher testament to human achievement than Shakespeare's plays or Rembrandt's self-portraits. He thinks the future of civilisation hangs on our ability to design a better teapot. In other words, he is bonkers but quite readably bonkers. My problem with design-worship is I can never quite decide whether merely to dislike it or passionately disapprove of it. Should I put it in the category of activities like morris dancing, which I would never want to do myself but can't seriously object to other people doing, or should I put it in the category of, say, telephone cold-calling where I would favour life imprisonment for everyone involved?

But almost immediately he ran into problems and found the whole organisation 'utterly scary'. He thought Peter Mandelson would be a soulmate, but Mandelson didn't want to know. When Bayley floated his wizard wheezes - let's get Bill Gates involved, let's consult Susan Sontag and Nicholas Negroponte of MIT, let's have Richard Dawkins to advise us on the Faith Zone - Mandelson flatly said 'no'. He didn't want 'the best brains in the world,' he wanted British brains. And, above all, he wanted the Dome to be popular which was not part of Bayley's thinking at all. Bayley finally resigned when Mandelson made his well-publicised pilgrimage to Disneyland in January 1998. For him it was the last straw, as he told the press, 'If Mandy went down to a voodoo sacrifice in Brixton tonight he'd come back tomorrow saying, \"We must have voodoo sacrifices in the Dome.\"' A National Millennium Experience Commission mole countered that Bayley had 'become an embarrassment... He was the sort of person who had tantrums and threatened to resign several times.' Bayley recently told Esquire , 'I wouldn't go so far as to say my feud with Mandelson is an expression of frustrated love...' but that is what it sounds like. He has seen Mandelson once since the Dome, when he was lunching in a restaurant with David and Serena Linley and Mandelson walked in 'with two rather lugubrious looking youths, who didn't look as if they were officials from the Northern Ireland office', but the pair studiously ignored each other. Bayley admits that there was an anxious period between his leaving the Dome and the Dome opening when he thought, 'Oh, shit, if it turns out all right, I'll never work again.' But, luckily, it was a disaster and he watched the opening ceremony on television 'the way you can't take your eyes off a car crash'. He visited the Dome only once, for The Daily Telegraph , and basked in an orgy of 'I told you sos'. But when he thinks about what might have been, and how he and Mandelson could have created something wonderful together, 'it makes my teeth ache. I'm thinking of going on a vast hypnotherapy course to stop me thinking about the Dome ever again.' Now, oddly, he is proposing to throw himself to the lions again - he wants to succeed Alan Borg as director of the V&amp;A. He says he could be the creative director and they could have some more ordinary mortal to do the administration. He thinks the V&amp;A should 'merchandise' itself more. 'I mean museums and department stores were created at exactly the same moment in European history in about 1850 and they are both the expression of the same belief system. I'm not saying I would try to turn the V&amp;A into a shop, but you can do both . You can maintain a superb scholarship and you can make money out of design consultancy and merchandising. I mean you've got fantastic experts in furniture, decoration, fashion - curators don't have to sit around in fusty studies all the time.' So how far has his candidacy actually got? He claims that 'sources close to the V&amp;A' encouraged him to stand, and he saw the head-hunters in August 'and did an absolute bravura display of silliness', but hasn't heard a word since. Typically, he prefaced his application by writing an article for The Independent which even he calls 'a suicide note' in which he described the V&amp;A trustees as 'cheesy placemen'. Not surprisingly, the cheesy placemen haven't invited him for interview. 'Oh they're not going to give it me,' he admits in an odd flash of realism, 'because I'm too noisy, I'm too restless and I'm too provocative. But if they want someone like me there's no one better!' Pigs might fly, of course, but I would guess he is unlikely to get the V&amp;A. Luckily he has plan B, which is to start a business, somewhere between advertising, design consultancy and public relations. 'Because for good or for bad, my name is very well known and if you're known as a \"design guru\" - please preserve the irony - you may as well trade on it, instead of just taking phone calls from World at One asking for your comment on the new lion house at Dunstable Zoo. So I think it may be time to properly exploit my knowledge and notoriety. While I haven't been exactly in hibernation since the Design Museum, I haven't totally focused on anything really, and I think it may be time to focus myself now.' He turns 50 next year, so it seems a good moment. He is, as he says, totally, passionately, eternally committed to good design but he recognises that this enthusiasm is not widely shared. 'It's one of the many things which causes pain and misery in my life because I can't believe that other people don't care. I mean I don't want to speak ill of the late-lamented Donald Dewar, but his clothes! I just don't understand how you can not be concerned about your appearance. From time to time I'm vilified as the person who cares about the look of a teapot - and it's not that I believe my taste is superior , I just can not believe that other people don't care. But why I'm quite pleased with my book is that it does show that I was interested in these things long before it became fashionable and I promise you I will still be interested in it afterwards - it is a genuine perversion or whatever you want to call it, it is not a momentary thing.' I believe him. But I also believe that there is something unbalanced about worshipping appearance as much as he does. In General Knowledge , Bayley reprints an article he wrote in 1991, about the cars museum directors drive, in the course of which he says that he once saw Nicholas Serota driving a Volvo 340 and could never take the Turner Prize seriously again. And yet he says now that he deeply admires Tate Modern, so doesn't he see that he was wrong to write Serota off purely because he drove the wrong car? 'No. I believe in Corbusier's definition, that design is intelligence made visible. And if you are someone like me, suffering from my delusions, you believe there is no such thing as an innocent gesture. Everything we do, wear, buy - or everything we reject - says something about us. That's part of the fascination of the modern world - there's no such thing as innocent choice. So Nick and his Volvo 340 is significant. Because how can you have a fine eye and not want to apply it to everything? He is supposed to be the leading national spokesman for modernism. And yet he can suspend his judgement enough to drive a crap heap, one of the worst machines ever made. And if you think art is very important how can you drive a Volvo 340?' At the end of our conversation, Bayley insists on walking me to my car. I wish, wish, wish it were a Volvo 340, but I am confident that my Mondeo will have the same effect. Unfortunately, it doesn't - the Mondeo for some weird reason comes within his definition of approved design. So, Nick Serota, if you are reading this - trade down, swop your Volvo for a Mondeo and you can earn the admiration of a Stephen Bayley. But I am inclined to think that, having built Tate Modern, you don't really need to bother. Let those who worship the teapot live by the teapot.",

Along the way, we get odd insights into the making of the great novels, The Big Sleep, Farewell, My Lovely, The Little Sister and The Long Goodbye . </p> <p>Although he might have impressed himself with the coruscating frankness of his judgments, Chandler, who disdained 'the anthology racket' and critics who 'write pukey little introductions and sit back with an indulgent smile and all nine pockets open' would have had several harsh things to say about this book. It is sloppily annotated, disgracefully lacking in source material and absurdly overpriced. </p> <p>Never mind. Some pages more than repay the cost of entry.

      "bodyText": "The Raymond Chandler Papers: Selected Letters and Non-Fiction Edited by Tom Hiney and Frank MacShane Hamish Hamilton, \u00a320, pp266 Buy it at BOL According to Tom Hiney, who has already written a well-received biography of Raymond Chandler, his letters 'are an unusually honest and freewheeling journey into the mind of a man who had seen a lot, read a lot, drunk a lot, thought a lot and steered perilously close to insanity in the process...' This is a useful advertisement for a volume that's basically for the fans, for whom Chandler's insomniac ramblings, dictated in the small hours to his Mexican secretary, are the essential commentary on what Chandler himself described as 'a rather forlorn sort of life'. As Hiney freely acknowledges, there have already been two selections of Chandler papers (1962; 1981) since his death in 1959, and this one depends heavily on the work of the great Chandler scholar, the late Frank McShane. The picture it offers is of an obsessive writer, maniacally wrestling with the demons of alcoholism and loneliness in a variety of one-horse Californian hotels, sustained by the love of his wife Cissy, a woman 10 years his senior. Along the way, we get odd insights into the making of the great novels, The Big Sleep, Farewell, My Lovely, The Little Sister and The Long Goodbye . Although he might have impressed himself with the coruscating frankness of his judgments, Chandler, who disdained 'the anthology racket' and critics who 'write pukey little introductions and sit back with an indulgent smile and all nine pockets open' would have had several harsh things to say about this book. It is sloppily annotated, disgracefully lacking in source material and absurdly overpriced. Never mind. Some pages more than repay the cost of entry. 'My ideas of what constitutes good writing,' he noted in 1957, 'are increasingly rebellious.' He was inclined, he said, 'to tell all the fancy boys to go to hell, all the subtle-subtle ones... that subtlety is only a technique... The things that last,' he went on, 'come from the deeper levels of a writer's being'. Oddly enough, this was almost exactly the opinion of his near contemporary, P.G. Wodehouse.

He was prolific and visible. He formed potent alliances with other Oxford poets like James Fenton and Andrew Motion, and with novelist friends like Martin Amis and Ian McEwan. His brainchild, the 'Martian' poem, known otherwise as the school of metaphor or defamiliarisation, was the only label going in a featureless English landscape demoralised by the blatant superiority of the poets of Northern Ireland: Heaney, Mahon, Longley, Paulin, Muldoon. In dingy, depressed, anxious Grub Street, Raine seemed like a flash of Madison Avenue: brash, ambitious, can-do. In 1981, he took over as poetry editor at Faber and Faber, where he stayed for 10 years. I was one of his first signings. </p> <p>I can't say I read him in those days. There was no point. In the critical imagination, his fingerprints were all over 'his' Faber poets, and if you had any choice in the matter, it seemed miserable to be influenced by your editor , of all people. After suffering at first from his abrasiveness, I came to dote on him every bit as much as other poets of the time; he was a roof and a shield, a wonderful corner man and seemingly always on top form. Much the least part of him, I thought, was the poetry, which was small, mannered and barely comprehensible. In small doses, I could just about stand it, and so his most satisfactory publication, for me, was a pamphlet of six poems called A Free Translation , where the natural lightness of his effects was not crushed by architecture or intention. </p> <p>Ezra Pound said that the lyric age is between 17 and 22. It doesn't mean that whatever you write after that is doomed, but that the original impulse - something of which persists - is bound up with states particular to that age: innocence and defencelessness, a foisting of your own personal chaos and personal order upon the world, an experimental raising of your voice in the void, and seeing what sound it makes, if any. Craig Raine's poetry never seemed to partake of that: I can't imagine him green. It's not a biographical point, although when his first two books came out in quick succession, he was already in his mid-thirties. But it reinforces my feeling that his writing has always been something else, and came from nowhere else: it's a knack, a recipe, a theology, a box of tricks, a mutually supportive alibi. </p> <p>The proposition is that things are not as they seem. One example from millions: 'Without thinking, the giant/ puts a kettle on the octopus'; 'octopus' instead of gas hob, and 'giant' because we are in 'the great indoors'. As an expression of exuberance and gamesomeness, this kind of visual sidestepping is all very well from time to time, but as an habitual recourse I find it showy, disruptive, flippant, while as a load-bearing feature of a style and an outlook, it is completely worthless. In particular, the long poem, History: the Home Movie , that takes up half the 600 pages of these <strong> Collected Poems</strong> , strikes me as quite dreadful: a litany of insignificant and overspecified detail, sexual activity and laboured italics in between the now routine similes. It shows, if nothing else did, what a reductive and soulless commentary this type of writing is, and how repeatedly drawn to machinery and gourmandise and deformity. </p> <p>However disguised, the simile recurs and recurs in Raine. It is as predictable and irritating as a commercial break; it is, literally, 'a message from our sponsor'. As an occasional corrective, it may have had something to be said in its favour; now, I find it just as limited and shopworn as the clich\u00e9s of feeling and perception that Raine set out to overthrow. It is like being given nothing but fresh air to breathe, or a book peopled only by affectless killers, like Camus's Meursault, to whom Raine makes several obeisances. The surprise is not so much that Martianism - basically, a movement of one, as Jeeves is 'a stately procession of one' - failed to take off, but that Raine has found nothing better to do. Certainly, he makes me think longingly and reverently of Zbigniew Herbert, who writes of his Mr Cogito: 'He adored tautologies/ explanations/ idem per idem .' </p> <p>Raine's criticism, in the second of these gargantuan volumes, serves his poetry much more than most poets' criticism does, but, in its favour, you don't have to subscribe to the greatness of the poetry to enjoy and profit from at least some of the reviews and talks (rather grandly left unspecified) collected here. His writing is always vigorous, always clear, and the quotations are always just so. In particular, he shows an enviable grasp of certain prose classics - Joyce, Dickens, Lawrence - knowing them inside out. Apart from the piece on Emily Dickinson, which flags badly, the articles are well-steered and paced. That said, it takes a certain sustained perversity to read 'In Defence of T.S. Eliot' without being reminded of the poems of the critic; that certainly seems to be the intention. </p> <p>The short, vivid, arresting details and turns of phrase Raine loves to pick out - Lawrence's 'green dog-kennel', Primo Levi's 'uselessly excellent performance' (said of chewing-gum) or Joyce's version of the sound made by a cat, 'mkgnao' - are all momentary, contextless, brilliant impositions. It is easy to imagine they were all written by Raine; literature comes to seem like a huge, shattered mirror in whose shards he sees his own reflection. </p> <p>Further, this collection is just as much a genealogy as the two-page genealogy in History: the Home Movie , with Eliot, Joyce and Dickens the forefathers, (the fearfully overrated) Updike the uncle, Nicholson Baker and Elizabeth Bishop the cousins; and, on the distaff side, the Russians Pasternak, Chekhov, Bulgakov and Nabokov. </p> <p>As in the poetry, there is a certain levelling tendency at work in the criticism. On the basis of references to Shakespeare and the Bible, Frost is called a modernist and Kipling is compared to Pound. (To a vision where everything is something else anyway, the singularity and quiddity of a writer is liable to disappear.) For all the Russians in it, it is almost wholly English in its sympathies and has little feeling for other literatures: a piece ostensibly devoted to translation ends up by crowing that 'fuck' and 'stop' are pretty universally understood. There is a school prize-day atmosphere overhanging the whole thing, pomposity and cleverness in smelly socks: 'indisputably poetry of a high order'; 'well worth the Nobel Prize'; 'an honourable proxime accessit '. </p> <p>I can't end without mentioning a repellent and inept attack on Joseph Brodsky for being, of all things, a careerist (which Raine, from Oxford, his Akademgorod, must know a thing or two about), and in his ringingly nonsensical conclusion, 'a nervous, world-class mediocrity'. He ought to feel ashamed of himself, though there's not much chance of that. </p>",

His brainchild, the 'Martian' poem, known otherwise as the school of metaphor or defamiliarisation, was the only label going in a featureless English landscape demoralised by the blatant superiority of the poets of Northern Ireland: Heaney, Mahon, Longley, Paulin, Muldoon. In dingy, depressed, anxious Grub Street, Raine seemed like a flash of Madison Avenue: brash, ambitious, can-do. In 1981, he took over as poetry editor at Faber and Faber, where he stayed for 10 years. I was one of his first signings. I can't say I read him in those days. There was no point. In the critical imagination, his fingerprints were all over 'his' Faber poets, and if you had any choice in the matter, it seemed miserable to be influenced by your editor , of all people. After suffering at first from his abrasiveness, I came to dote on him every bit as much as other poets of the time; he was a roof and a shield, a wonderful corner man and seemingly always on top form. Much the least part of him, I thought, was the poetry, which was small, mannered and barely comprehensible. In small doses, I could just about stand it, and so his most satisfactory publication, for me, was a pamphlet of six poems called A Free Translation , where the natural lightness of his effects was not crushed by architecture or intention. Ezra Pound said that the lyric age is between 17 and 22. It doesn't mean that whatever you write after that is doomed, but that the original impulse - something of which persists - is bound up with states particular to that age: innocence and defencelessness, a foisting of your own personal chaos and personal order upon the world, an experimental raising of your voice in the void, and seeing what sound it makes, if any. Craig Raine's poetry never seemed to partake of that: I can't imagine him green. It's not a biographical point, although when his first two books came out in quick succession, he was already in his mid-thirties. But it reinforces my feeling that his writing has always been something else, and came from nowhere else: it's a knack, a recipe, a theology, a box of tricks, a mutually supportive alibi. The proposition is that things are not as they seem. One example from millions: 'Without thinking, the giant/ puts a kettle on the octopus'; 'octopus' instead of gas hob, and 'giant' because we are in 'the great indoors'. As an expression of exuberance and gamesomeness, this kind of visual sidestepping is all very well from time to time, but as an habitual recourse I find it showy, disruptive, flippant, while as a load-bearing feature of a style and an outlook, it is completely worthless. In particular, the long poem, History: the Home Movie , that takes up half the 600 pages of these Collected Poems , strikes me as quite dreadful: a litany of insignificant and overspecified detail, sexual activity and laboured italics in between the now routine similes. It shows, if nothing else did, what a reductive and soulless commentary this type of writing is, and how repeatedly drawn to machinery and gourmandise and deformity. However disguised, the simile recurs and recurs in Raine. It is as predictable and irritating as a commercial break; it is, literally, 'a message from our sponsor'. As an occasional corrective, it may have had something to be said in its favour; now, I find it just as limited and shopworn as the clich\u00e9s of feeling and perception that Raine set out to overthrow. It is like being given nothing but fresh air to breathe, or a book peopled only by affectless killers, like Camus's Meursault, to whom Raine makes several obeisances. The surprise is not so much that Martianism - basically, a movement of one, as Jeeves is 'a stately procession of one' - failed to take off, but that Raine has found nothing better to do. Certainly, he makes me think longingly and reverently of Zbigniew Herbert, who writes of his Mr Cogito: 'He adored tautologies/ explanations/ idem per idem .' Raine's criticism, in the second of these gargantuan volumes, serves his poetry much more than most poets' criticism does, but, in its favour, you don't have to subscribe to the greatness of the poetry to enjoy and profit from at least some of the reviews and talks (rather grandly left unspecified) collected here. His writing is always vigorous, always clear, and the quotations are always just so. In particular, he shows an enviable grasp of certain prose classics - Joyce, Dickens, Lawrence - knowing them inside out. Apart from the piece on Emily Dickinson, which flags badly, the articles are well-steered and paced. That said, it takes a certain sustained perversity to read 'In Defence of T.S. Eliot' without being reminded of the poems of the critic; that certainly seems to be the intention. The short, vivid, arresting details and turns of phrase Raine loves to pick out - Lawrence's 'green dog-kennel', Primo Levi's 'uselessly excellent performance' (said of chewing-gum) or Joyce's version of the sound made by a cat, 'mkgnao' - are all momentary, contextless, brilliant impositions. It is easy to imagine they were all written by Raine; literature comes to seem like a huge, shattered mirror in whose shards he sees his own reflection. Further, this collection is just as much a genealogy as the two-page genealogy in History: the Home Movie , with Eliot, Joyce and Dickens the forefathers, (the fearfully overrated) Updike the uncle, Nicholson Baker and Elizabeth Bishop the cousins; and, on the distaff side, the Russians Pasternak, Chekhov, Bulgakov and Nabokov. As in the poetry, there is a certain levelling tendency at work in the criticism. On the basis of references to Shakespeare and the Bible, Frost is called a modernist and Kipling is compared to Pound. (To a vision where everything is something else anyway, the singularity and quiddity of a writer is liable to disappear.) For all the Russians in it, it is almost wholly English in its sympathies and has little feeling for other literatures: a piece ostensibly devoted to translation ends up by crowing that 'fuck' and 'stop' are pretty universally understood. There is a school prize-day atmosphere overhanging the whole thing, pomposity and cleverness in smelly socks: 'indisputably poetry of a high order'; 'well worth the Nobel Prize'; 'an honourable proxime accessit '. I can't end without mentioning a repellent and inept attack on Joseph Brodsky for being, of all things, a careerist (which Raine, from Oxford, his Akademgorod, must know a thing or two about), and in his ringingly nonsensical conclusion, 'a nervous, world-class mediocrity'. He ought to feel ashamed of himself, though there's not much chance of that.",

      "body": "<p>It took until the Friday of the Lord's Test before cricket was pushed off the back pages. The golden summer of 2001 witnessed a long-overdue renaissance of English cricket, when the home side trounced Pakistan 2-0 (following their somewhat unexpected 1-0 triumph in the winter), swept the triangular one-day series and demolished Australia in the first Ashes Test at Edgbaston.</p> <p>The nation had seen nothing like since that Botham-charged summer of 1981 or the glory days of Compton and Edrich. But while the country celebrated the rebirth of its summer sport, all was not well at Lancaster Gate. </p> <p>Qualification for the 2002 World Cup was virtually impossible after Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson's side had been turned over by Albania and Greece, Premiership attendances were falling and the chances of any English side progressing beyond the first stage of the Champions League were slim. There were rumblings that football might be losing its grip. </p> <p>At much the same time Rupert Murdoch's apparatchiks in Sky's west London headquarters had equally furrowed brows. The old boy had just announced that he would be spending Christmas 2001 in London - it was his daughter's turn to host the family festivities - and this could only mean trouble. </p> <p>He was bound to watch Sky Sports on the big day, and his likely response to the prospective fare - Christmas Carols sung by Richard Keys and Classic Truck Races from the Seventies - sent a collective shiver through the top floor. Surely there was a way to impress him?</p> <p>A few days later the FA's Adam Crozier and David Davies stepped out into the sunshine to meet the assembled press. 'After a great deal of careful thought,' Davies said earnestly, 'we've decided to respond to public demand and bring back one of football's great traditions - football on Christmas Day.' </p> <p>When the fine print was examined it became clear that what was happening wasn't just football on Christmas Day, but football all Christmas Day. Six matches, constituting an all-day banquet of big game after big game - not to mention the most contrived fixture list in the history of football. </p> <p>9am: Newcastle v Sunderland</p> <p>11am: Rangers v Celtic</p> <p>1pm: Everton v Liverpool</p> <p>3pm: Arsenal v Tottenham</p> <p>3.45(ish): Queen's Speech/Half-time analysis from Highbury</p> <p>5.30pm: Hearts v Hibernian</p> <p>8pm: Man Utd v Man City </p> <p>10pm: Goals On Christmas Day, with Clare Tomlinson and Robbie Earle</p> <p>'Football's festive feast!', proclaimed the Sun. The non-Murdoch press were less impressed. 'Blasphemy!' blasted the front page of the Mail. 'Sky 6, Christ 0' scoffed the Mirror. 'Blair silent over Murdoch's Christmas coup' offered the Guardian. </p> <p>'It's a disgraceful act of exploitation,' thundered the BBC's director-general Greg Dyke, who denied a report that he had instructed his executives to schedule the start of Only Fools and Horses to coincide with half-time at Old Trafford. </p> <p>In the weeks leading up to the big day the battle lines were drawn. The Observer ran a four-page Focus special on Murdoch's abuse of his monopoly position, while the Times offered a special supplement about how to survive the holiday period - including detailed previews to all the matches.</p> <p>Dr George Carey, the Archbishop of Canterbury, said he was sorry that football fans were being forced to choose between Jesus Christ and David Beckham on Christmas Day. Richard Littlejohn wrote that for most supporters that wasn't a difficult choice. David Mellor responded to Five Live's decision to cover the matches by resigning from the station - which forced Dr Carey to admit that at least some good had come from the controversy.</p> <p>The day itself proved something of an anti-climax. All the matches drew full houses, but Sky didn't fare so well, with fans picking and choosing their games. Three goalless draws didn't help, but Only Fools And Horses (which did start at 8.50) pulled in 14m more viewers than the second half from Old Trafford. </p> <p>When the final calculations were made Sky had spent \u00a311.4m and got 8 per cent more viewers than had watched the truck racing the year before.</p> <p>And Rupert Murdoch? Sadly he and Wendy had a last-minute change of plan and spent Christmas in the Far East instead.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It took until the Friday of the Lord's Test before cricket was pushed off the back pages. The golden summer of 2001 witnessed a long-overdue renaissance of English cricket, when the home side trounced Pakistan 2-0 (following their somewhat unexpected 1-0 triumph in the winter), swept the triangular one-day series and demolished Australia in the first Ashes Test at Edgbaston. The nation had seen nothing like since that Botham-charged summer of 1981 or the glory days of Compton and Edrich. But while the country celebrated the rebirth of its summer sport, all was not well at Lancaster Gate. Qualification for the 2002 World Cup was virtually impossible after Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson's side had been turned over by Albania and Greece, Premiership attendances were falling and the chances of any English side progressing beyond the first stage of the Champions League were slim. There were rumblings that football might be losing its grip. At much the same time Rupert Murdoch's apparatchiks in Sky's west London headquarters had equally furrowed brows. The old boy had just announced that he would be spending Christmas 2001 in London - it was his daughter's turn to host the family festivities - and this could only mean trouble. He was bound to watch Sky Sports on the big day, and his likely response to the prospective fare - Christmas Carols sung by Richard Keys and Classic Truck Races from the Seventies - sent a collective shiver through the top floor. Surely there was a way to impress him? A few days later the FA's Adam Crozier and David Davies stepped out into the sunshine to meet the assembled press. 'After a great deal of careful thought,' Davies said earnestly, 'we've decided to respond to public demand and bring back one of football's great traditions - football on Christmas Day.' When the fine print was examined it became clear that what was happening wasn't just football on Christmas Day, but football all Christmas Day. Six matches, constituting an all-day banquet of big game after big game - not to mention the most contrived fixture list in the history of football. 9am: Newcastle v Sunderland 11am: Rangers v Celtic 1pm: Everton v Liverpool 3pm: Arsenal v Tottenham 3.45(ish): Queen's Speech/Half-time analysis from Highbury 5.30pm: Hearts v Hibernian 8pm: Man Utd v Man City 10pm: Goals On Christmas Day, with Clare Tomlinson and Robbie Earle 'Football's festive feast!', proclaimed the Sun. The non-Murdoch press were less impressed. 'Blasphemy!' blasted the front page of the Mail. 'Sky 6, Christ 0' scoffed the Mirror. 'Blair silent over Murdoch's Christmas coup' offered the Guardian. 'It's a disgraceful act of exploitation,' thundered the BBC's director-general Greg Dyke, who denied a report that he had instructed his executives to schedule the start of Only Fools and Horses to coincide with half-time at Old Trafford. In the weeks leading up to the big day the battle lines were drawn. The Observer ran a four-page Focus special on Murdoch's abuse of his monopoly position, while the Times offered a special supplement about how to survive the holiday period - including detailed previews to all the matches. Dr George Carey, the Archbishop of Canterbury, said he was sorry that football fans were being forced to choose between Jesus Christ and David Beckham on Christmas Day. Richard Littlejohn wrote that for most supporters that wasn't a difficult choice. David Mellor responded to Five Live's decision to cover the matches by resigning from the station - which forced Dr Carey to admit that at least some good had come from the controversy. The day itself proved something of an anti-climax. All the matches drew full houses, but Sky didn't fare so well, with fans picking and choosing their games. Three goalless draws didn't help, but Only Fools And Horses (which did start at 8.50) pulled in 14m more viewers than the second half from Old Trafford. When the final calculations were made Sky had spent \u00a311.4m and got 8 per cent more viewers than had watched the truck racing the year before. And Rupert Murdoch? Sadly he and Wendy had a last-minute change of plan and spent Christmas in the Far East instead.",

But Matth\u00e4us also revealed he has turned down offers from France and from the Premiership.

'We lost the match against Chile even before getting to the field,' Babayaro said, 'because the players spent more time haggling instead of concentrating on the task at hand.' Describing his colleagues as gutless traders - they refused to play for the $2,000 match fee, claiming they could earn $10,000 with their clubs, Babayaro claimed 'I had to go on my knees pleading with the boys to win first before making any demands but it all fell on deaf ears as most of them insisted on collecting $5,000. Honestly, in all my years in the national team, I have never seen the bunch of indisciplined players like those I captained at the Olympics.'

'I think that well-played football throws up certain situations which oblige a player to foul ,' Phil said last summer. 'I'm not going to tell my players \"don't do that because it's ugly\".

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Whatever elation - or relief - Dick Advocaat may have felt at Rangers' extraordinary resurgence in form over the past week, the little Dutchman has, since the day after the thrashing of Celtic last Sunday, been evincing welcome signs that he recognises the unlikelihood of instantly turning bitter, dark days into sweetness and light. </p> <p>This had not appeared to be the case in the immediate aftermath of the Old Firm victory. Advocaat then had a solemn demeanour that was accompanied by comments which bordered on churlishness. Sarcastic allusions to Celtic having produced a video of their 6-2 win at Parkhead in August and to football writers who had scorned his team's endeavours during their slump were resonant of an unattractive, I-told-you-so triumphalism. </p> <p>His post-match bullishness left many who were present with the impression that the manager was being somewhat premature with conviction that all of the Ibrox side's ills had been cured in the course of 90 minutes. </p> <p>Whether subsequent newspaper criticism had an effect, or somebody at Ibrox had a word, or Advocaat himself simply reviewed his behaviour and decided to remodel, there has been a noticeable and much more gratifying tendency towards realism.

      "bodyText": "Whatever elation - or relief - Dick Advocaat may have felt at Rangers' extraordinary resurgence in form over the past week, the little Dutchman has, since the day after the thrashing of Celtic last Sunday, been evincing welcome signs that he recognises the unlikelihood of instantly turning bitter, dark days into sweetness and light. This had not appeared to be the case in the immediate aftermath of the Old Firm victory. Advocaat then had a solemn demeanour that was accompanied by comments which bordered on churlishness. Sarcastic allusions to Celtic having produced a video of their 6-2 win at Parkhead in August and to football writers who had scorned his team's endeavours during their slump were resonant of an unattractive, I-told-you-so triumphalism. His post-match bullishness left many who were present with the impression that the manager was being somewhat premature with conviction that all of the Ibrox side's ills had been cured in the course of 90 minutes. Whether subsequent newspaper criticism had an effect, or somebody at Ibrox had a word, or Advocaat himself simply reviewed his behaviour and decided to remodel, there has been a noticeable and much more gratifying tendency towards realism. Utterances such as 'we still have a long way to go' and 'you can't always talk about bad luck, sometimes you have to look at your quality' have entered his conversation and restored a much more balanced view. Even before the patchy performance which brought a 1-0 victory over Kaiserslautern in the home leg of their Uefa Cup third-round tie on Thursday, Advocaat had clearly adopted a more sober approach. The match against the Germans merely confirmed the advisability of his change of heart. As another potentially crucial week begins - with Hearts to be faced at Tynecastle this afternoon and Kaiserslautern at the Fritz Walter Stadium on Thursday - it is evident that Advocaat will have to confront more dressing-room disaffection while attempting to complete his team's rehabilitation.

The Russia winger was not only ordered from the field, but fined and instructed to turn out for the under-21 team. Ricksen, apparently, escaped without censure and disenchantment, may be too weak a word for his feelings. But Advocaat's uneasy relationship with his former captain, Lorenzo Amoruso, may be in danger of further deterioration when the Italian is denied the armband for the match in Germany. Amoruso's successor, Barry Ferguson, is suspended for that return with Kaiserslautern and Advocaat revealed that another of his compatriots, Arthur Numan, would deputise.

      "body": "<p>Ars\u00e8ne Wenger had a funny thing to say when the draw was announced a couple of weeks back for the second phase of the Champions' League. 'Manchester United have the easiest group of the three English teams,' he said, 'but are you surprised?'</p> <p>Curious little question to leave hanging in the air, that. Oddly acidic coming from the normally good-humoured Frenchman. Something was eating him. What was it? Assuming he was not suggesting Manchester United have a mole in Uefa, it could only have been one thing. </p> <p>Wenger has convinced himself that in the great football rivalry of contemporary times the odds are stacked unfairly against him. That the reason why he has had to play Salieri to Alex Ferguson's Mozart, why his team have won one major trophy and Ferguson's five in the past four years, is not that Manchester United are better. It is that they have the gods on their side.</p> <p>In short, if the Frenchman were to cut out the insinuation and get bluntly to the point what he would say would be something along the lines of 'Ferguson is one lucky bastard'.</p> <p>Ferguson himself would be the first to agree. He's just brought out another book. It's called The Unique Treble, a lovingly detailed game-by-game account of the season the world's best supported club enjoyed in 1998/99, complete with diagrams of every single goal scored, that should ease the Christmas present headaches of a lot of mums, girfriends and wives from Manchester to Mandalay. </p> <p>Asked why he is always banging on (yes, in those very words) about the uniqueness of his side's Treble - how no one is going to win the English league, FA Cup and European Cup again, ever - Ferguson does not take offence. </p> <p>'A few factors,' he replies crisply, 'the first of which was luck.' </p> <p>Luck? </p> <p>'Aye. No doubt about it. Luck.'</p> <p>It's nice to hear the most successful coach in world football attribute the greatest achievement of his life not to his genius, not to his talent for motivation, not to his shrewd tactics and team selection, but - first and foremost - to those random forces over which we mortals have no control. </p> <p>Ferguson does not have a reputation for being a nice man. Meeting him, you don't change your mind. He might be a decent man. He might be a good man. With his family and friends. But he is not nice in the sense of being the sort of person who will go out of his way to be charming to strangers, to inquire as to their general state of health. He is too busy for that. </p> <p>But since, if anything, he has a reputation for being a bit of an ogre - for being a bully to journalists he dislikes, for example, and for committing acts of gratuitous unkindness against the likes of his former assistant Brian Kidd - then it is all the more refreshing to hear him humbly admit that his own role in Manchester United's most glorious triumph, important as it might have been, was strictly secondary.</p> <p>And it wasn't just a spur of the moment remark, a bizarre moment of uncharacteristic self-effacement. In the book he admits as much too. He acknowledges an element of good fortune in those two late, late goals his team scored to win the European Cup in Barcelona and he reflects: 'I think fate rewarded us.'</p> <p>Now, obviously it was luck. Obviously it was fate. Especially in the knock-out competitions, it always is in football - barring the rare emergence of a team that is blindingly superior to the rest, like Gullit's and Van Basten's Milan, Brazil in 1970, the great Real Madrid. </p> <p>Had Schmeichel decided to dive the other way in the FA Cup semi-final replay Bergkamp would have scored and Arsenal would have gone through; had the Bayern Munich players not kept hitting the bar and missing sitters in the second half of the European Cup final, Sheringham and Solksjaer would never have had their night to remember; had Simeone's 'goal' in the quarter-final well, one could go on citing such examples all day long.</p> <p>The big reason why Ferguson knows his team were lucky to win the Treble was the miraculous absence of injuries during virtually the entire second half of the season. 'Remarkable, and in that vital period going into the semi-final of the FA Cup, with all the fixtures piling up the way they were! Another unique part of it was that we did not have an easy Cup run. It was Middlesbrough, then Liverpool, then Fulham (who were flying at the time), then Chelsea and a replay, then Arsenal and a replay. Now, you need luck to get through that. Only one player missed the final because of injury, and that was Henning Berg. Which is very unusual. So that was luck. Aye, that was luck.'</p> <p>Ferguson is talking in the airy reception area of the main building at Manchester United's new training facility in the Cheshire countryside, 20 minutes' drive from Old Trafford. It is a long, low, sleek building of clean metallic lines and lots of glass, glass tinged turquoise blue. It is the sort of building you would expect to hear Norman Foster had designed; the sort of building a big international software firm would choose to set up its European research centre. Of a piece, in other words, with the modern, multinational, multimedia, multi-merchandising operation that Manchester United plc has become in the Ferguson era.</p> <p>Whatever it is they are paying the Scotsman, you feel, it can't be enough. Because, critical a part as luck may have played in his success, the statistics have a relentlessness about them during the past decade of his watch that tell you he himself must clearly be doing something right. It is a subject on which, sitting cross-legged in blue shorts and a white shirt embroidered with the initials 'AF', he is happy to expound.</p> <p>The first factor over which a manager can exercise some control which Ferguson mentions as key to his success, especially in that Treble season, is team spirit. 'You could sense that we were not going to lose games because of that team spirit. They've' (he searches for the word, he often pauses to search for the right word) 'they've enshrined that team spirit. It's a marvellous thing for a manager because that is what you try to create, because you're always looking for signs of a player's motivation, how they are reacting under pressure. Everyone was up.'</p> <p>Signs? What signs, precisely, did he look for?</p> <p>'You have to be alert to players' behaviour patterns. How they come in every morning, how they behave with each other. Especially with the pressure on, especially in March and April. What I have to look for is if all of a sudden the atmosphere is too quiet and players, perhaps irrationally, lose their tempers, or have an argument about nothing in particular. Or players who keep going to the toilet, things like that.'</p> <p>Going to the toilet? 'Well, yes, but then you have to know your players' habits. Some players, actually, like Steve Bruce would always go to the toilet before a game. Just before a game. It came naturally to him. I mean, it was sort of like his superstition, because all players are always superstitious. What you have to look for is a change in the patterns and if you detect that you have to step in and make things smoother.'</p> <p>Ferguson has this reputation for playing mind games, for psyching out opponents. Whether it is deserved or not what becomes very clear very early into the conversation is that understanding and shaping his players' psychology - each and every player's psychology - is a very big part indeed of his notion of what the manager's job should be. Maybe, more than tactics or anything, the principal part.</p> <p>So, if he saw a player behaving strangely under pressure would he go and engage him in a one to one? 'Aye, aye. But you have to gauge things just right. Sometimes the excitement and tension is good for them. Sometimes it's too much. That depends on the personality. It varies from player to player. You have to observe, to know, to judge.'</p> <p>And when, having filtered the question through his refined thought processes, he decides to take a player aside for a chat, what does he say? Ferguson pauses to weigh up the question. Pondering, how much to give away no doubt; but also mindful, as he says, of the perception the players have of him, how some fear him, how some - as he acknowledges with what appears to be an element of sincere surprise - are 'frightened to death' of him.</p> <p>'Well, now, if I am in a situation where I have to go to a player,' he says, indicating that this something he does not do often and, therefore, cannot be taken lightly, 'then I would try not to overwhelm him. I would probably say, \"Look\", in a general sense, \"look: trust yourself.\"'</p> <p>Ferguson's voice lowers as he does an imitation of himself talking privately to one of his players. He is confiding something important, something that is not only serious in his life, but solemn. His relationship with his players, those great-hearted team-spirited players that have given him so much, is terribly, terribly important to him. It is the very heart of him.</p> <p>Lowering his voice still further, whispering like a priest at confession, he continues: 'You know, it is a great word, \"trust\". You trust yourself and trust your team mates. That's the other half of it, you say. \"You know you've got these good players playing in your team. Trust them. You're in good hands.\"'</p> <p>But is it always true that they are in good hands? Don't players have off days? 'Aye but, you see, you see to win a game of football,' - abruptly he raises the volume, as if shaking himself out of this sensitive, slightly unmanly register he somehow strayed into, resuming the gruff, forthright persona he prefers to present to the world, - 'to win a game of football you need eight performers'. </p> <p>Eight? 'You need eight performing well. The other three can be carried along. They can be carried along even if it's your best player who's having a bad day. Because even if two or three players don't reach their level their influence is there, the commitment is so great that it keeps them all in the game.'</p> <p>Getting players 'to reach their level': is that a mystery or a science?</p> <p>'The science is in the preparation. Because there are two things you have to try and get through in the training environment. One is an atmosphere in which the players enjoy training; the second thing is to provide a platform for them to develop all the time, so that the training sessions must be quality, encourage them to improve their performance. All my life I've felt it is my job to create an environment where players are enjoying training, they look forward to it. If you get that right and if you don't allow the quality to drop then you will see the results on Saturday.'</p> <p>He might have held these convictions all his life but, as he readily admits, well into his career he consciously refined his approach to coaching. 'Yes, 'I'd been 18 years in management, I had made my mark but I was prepared to change.' How? Surprisingly enough, it took a Frenchman to teach a Scot to renew his commitment to the work ethic.</p> <p>'Cantona came to the club and after training he stayed behind to practise. Even in mid-winter. Amazing! I'll tell you a story. The night before we played Liverpool in the FA Cup Final, we were down at a hotel on the Thames. It was about nine o'clock. The players had already eaten and I was sitting with the staff having dinner, it was a lovely summer's evening, when I look outside and there's Cantona doing stretching exercises on the lawn.' Ferguson recalls the scene in hushed awe. 'That changed me. What Cantona added to my sense of the job, of management, was that ethic, which then became a foundation of my approach.'</p> <p>The other thing he learnt from Cantona was to spend more time in training practising with the ball. 'We always do it at the end of a session. Passing the ball to feet quickly, controlling the ball, crossing, finishing. I just stand and watch. It's terrific.' The principle is that players can always improve. </p> <p>'It's a fallacy people have that players have this God-given talent and that's it, that they're a finished product at 18. A lot of players are late developers. Look at Zidane: what did we hear about him when he was 21, 22? We try to look for the finished product too early in this country. We keep talking about the great youth, at under-18 level. But if you go back the past two decades, all these great under-18 year-olds, how many have made it? How many make it as senior players?'</p> <p>One who did was Ryan Giggs, Manchester United's longest serving player. In The Unique Treble Ferguson recalls the wonder goal Giggs scored against Arsenal in the FA Cup semi-final and says: 'When I see Ryan Giggs performing as he did in this game there is not a player in the world to touch him.' </p> <p>To this day Ferguson recollects with wonder the first time he saw Giggs play, as a 13-year-old. 'It was the way he ran,' Ferguson says, looking into his mind's eye, oozing affection for Giggs, and for the beautiful game, 'the way he skipped over the ground, his head up like a cocker spaniel chasing a bit of silver paper around.'</p> <p>Young players are not always as easy to judge as Giggs was. What does he look for when someone brings him along a bright young prospect to examine? 'Well, of course, talent, ability, is the first attraction of any player. But just as important in the long run is to try and assess what kind of character he's got. Has he got the enthusiasm all the time? There is nothing better than seeing a fellow like Roy Keane, whose football ability is a result of the kind of passion he has. And then there is a player's character, and that you judge not in the dressing room but on the football field. There you see the true thing, because you can't hide out there. </p> <p>'So character, enthusiasm and ability are the three important factors. There are other, ancillary things. Like balance and speed. They're important. These probably determine the great players. But what you want to make sure you get right are these other things: ability, character, enthusiasm.'</p> <p>There is another factor that has to be added to the mix these days, one that did not exist in the days when Ferguson was a player. The celebrity factor, the millionaire player factor, which has destroyed a number of players who had all the ability and enthusiasm in the world.</p> <p>'Aye, aye,' Ferguson says, a little wearily. 'How a player's image has changed since, say, the Sixties! And how aware they are that they have this image to keep up, an image completely outside football. Which is why some will get a fancy car, some will wear an earring. So you have to say to yourself, at what point do I lose my control? At what point do I say, right, enough's enough? I am forever keeping an eye on this side of things, judging to see if it gets too much.'</p> <p>What are his criteria for deciding what is too much? He does not hesitate to answer. 'When it starts interfering with their performance.' And how can you be sure of relating one thing to another? Ferguson returns to his coach as psychologist persona.</p> <p>'If you see them change dramatically as an individual, as a person. Because the last thing I want is to see them change. I want to see them keep their feet on the ground, I want to see that they appreciate where they're coming from, and I want to see them go back to their parents and their wives the same person. I don't want to see a lot of bigheads running about the place. Now, let me quickly add, their egos are no problem for me. Because people with egos win games for you.'</p> <p>The key question for him as a manager in this age of the celebrity footballer, as for all managers in top flight football everywhere, is - as he said - not to lose control. To obtain and keep the respect of individuals who have a far higher public profile than you do and who, in many cases, earn far more money. When you are talking of really top-class players, an added complication is presented by the fact that they know - and they know you know - that they are more indispensable to the club than you are. </p> <p>A recent case in point at one of the few clubs in the world that is on the same level as Manchester United was John Toshack at Real Madrid. Toshack was fired a year ago in large measure because he was bigger in size only than the club's star players, none of whom ever took him completely seriously.</p> <p>Ferguson is keenly aware of the syndrome in question. Surprisingly, he takes the attitude 'there but for the grace of God go I'. 'Yes, and you know, where I am lucky,' again he drops his voice confidentially, 'where I am lucky is that this celebrity phenomenon - these big changes in the relationship between the players and the clubs, the players and the managers - has taken place during my time at United. That is when these things have evolved. I was already in place, you see, when this transformation happened. So new players have come to the club, or young stars have come through, but because I have already been here a time, and been successful, they have had to prove themselves to me. I have had the control.'</p> <p>In other words, Ferguson would not like to be a manager in the position of having to arrive cold at a club like Manchester United, which is probably to a large degree why he has already recommended his assistant, Steve McLaren, as the man who should succeed him. </p> <p>Which will be in barely a year and a half, if Ferguson does not change his mind about retiring when he reaches 60. What he himself will do has been the subject of endless speculation. For now he has limited himself to saying he would like to stay within the club, perhaps playing some kind of international scouting and liaison role. More interesting, or at any rate just as interesting, is what will become of David Beckham then? Will the great debate - should he stay wide or play in central midfield - finally have been resolved?</p> <p>'Well, obviously, when you've got maybe 35 per cent of your goals originating from Beckham you'd be crazy to go and take that thrust, that penetration away from the right hand side of the pitch. Right now, besides, he would compound my problem with the central midfielders I've already got.'</p> <p>Beckham himself has said he will move inside when Manchester United find a suitable replacement for him on the right. Is anyone around? 'Well, at the moment we have the young boy Chadwick who we're quite hopeful of. Greening could possibly play out there. Solksjaer could do too. But it's down to this. Could they operate as successfully as David Beckham?'</p> <p>The answer, clearly, is no. Though, partly to keep the opposition guessing, and partly to give him breathing space when the opposition close him down on the wing, Ferguson says he is encouraging him to move inside. </p> <p>'Except when we get to the last third when I like him to get into a position where he can get his crosses in. Because he's been fantastic for us. Fantastic. He's concentrated for so long on that part of his game, worked on his technique with such application, that his range in his crosses is marvellous. Unbelievable. His width, his ability to use the ball so intelligently from there, his crossfield passes, his short passes, his chips. Unbelievable.'</p> <p>Ferguson becomes quite rhapsodic going through his maestro's repertoire, as he does talking about Giggs and Keane. The sense you get is that on the one hand, for all the hard-bittenness, the lust to win at all costs that he conveys, he is also a fan, a lover of the game for the game's sake; on the other you sense too that for all the stories of the blow-dryer treatment he gives recalcitrants at half-time, and all the rest of it, he really and truly loves his players. They are his children, his family, his pride and joy. He is their number one fan.</p> <p>Which is perhaps why Ferguson is at pains to stress that, like a good father, it is he who has fuelled Beckham's repeatedly stated desire to switch to a central playmaker role, to become the English Zidane. 'I have said to him in the past, you will not be the top-class player you want to be unless you add other things to your game. A new range. And it's happening already this season. I see him developing all the time. He is natural goalscorer who has not been scoring goals for a couple of seasons. Now we see it happening.'</p> <p>So, will he end up in central midfield? 'I think he will. I think there will come a time when his ability to control games will flourish and he will need to be in central midfield.' Which means that he will become a better player, as Zidane did with time. 'That's right, yes. What greater maturity brings is greater authority. In the period from now to probably till he is 30, 31, he'll add that authority to his game.'</p> <p>Which raises a conundrum. If Beckham is maturing and becoming a greater player, if - as he noted - Nicky Butt is also significantly improving his game, if he had virtually the same team now as won the Treble in 1999, most of them hovering around the 25-year-old mark and therefore approaching their peak, why were Manchester United faring so much more poorly in the Champions' League this season than they were back then? </p> <p>Ferguson bristles but does not quarrel with the analysis. He cannot quarrel with figures which show that in the first group phase in the Treble year, playing against Barcelona, Bayern and Brondby, his team scored 20 goals and topped the group; while this year, playing against Anderlecht, PSV and Dynamo Kiev they sneaked through in second, scoring only 11 goals.</p> <p>Was it that the famous Ferguson hunger was ebbing, what with writing all these nostalgic books and all?

But what I think we are finding now is that teams are preparing really well for us. They're not attacking us. They're beating us in the counter-attack. Like PSV away. They scored early, sat back, waited to strike back at us.' </p> <p>So what will he do? 'Well, simple things, like not going for the throat all the time. We're going to have to sit back and allow them to come to us, and that is going to require a bit of patience.' Can he really change the style of play of such a settled team? There is no can about it. Ferguson has judged that he must. He lost to PSV away; he lost to Anderlecht away; he would not have made it to the next round of the Champions' League had it not been for a great piece of good fortune - as Ars\u00e8ne Wenger no doubt would have been the first to note - in the home victory against Dynamo Kiev. None of this makes Ferguson happy.</p> <p>He grits his teeth. He's top of the Premiership but his team is not firing on all cylinders, in all competitions.

      "bodyText": "Ars\u00e8ne Wenger had a funny thing to say when the draw was announced a couple of weeks back for the second phase of the Champions' League. 'Manchester United have the easiest group of the three English teams,' he said, 'but are you surprised?' Curious little question to leave hanging in the air, that. Oddly acidic coming from the normally good-humoured Frenchman. Something was eating him. What was it? Assuming he was not suggesting Manchester United have a mole in Uefa, it could only have been one thing. Wenger has convinced himself that in the great football rivalry of contemporary times the odds are stacked unfairly against him. That the reason why he has had to play Salieri to Alex Ferguson's Mozart, why his team have won one major trophy and Ferguson's five in the past four years, is not that Manchester United are better. It is that they have the gods on their side. In short, if the Frenchman were to cut out the insinuation and get bluntly to the point what he would say would be something along the lines of 'Ferguson is one lucky bastard'. Ferguson himself would be the first to agree. He's just brought out another book. It's called The Unique Treble, a lovingly detailed game-by-game account of the season the world's best supported club enjoyed in 1998/99, complete with diagrams of every single goal scored, that should ease the Christmas present headaches of a lot of mums, girfriends and wives from Manchester to Mandalay. Asked why he is always banging on (yes, in those very words) about the uniqueness of his side's Treble - how no one is going to win the English league, FA Cup and European Cup again, ever - Ferguson does not take offence. 'A few factors,' he replies crisply, 'the first of which was luck.' Luck? 'Aye. No doubt about it. Luck.' It's nice to hear the most successful coach in world football attribute the greatest achievement of his life not to his genius, not to his talent for motivation, not to his shrewd tactics and team selection, but - first and foremost - to those random forces over which we mortals have no control. Ferguson does not have a reputation for being a nice man. Meeting him, you don't change your mind. He might be a decent man. He might be a good man. With his family and friends. But he is not nice in the sense of being the sort of person who will go out of his way to be charming to strangers, to inquire as to their general state of health. He is too busy for that. But since, if anything, he has a reputation for being a bit of an ogre - for being a bully to journalists he dislikes, for example, and for committing acts of gratuitous unkindness against the likes of his former assistant Brian Kidd - then it is all the more refreshing to hear him humbly admit that his own role in Manchester United's most glorious triumph, important as it might have been, was strictly secondary. And it wasn't just a spur of the moment remark, a bizarre moment of uncharacteristic self-effacement. In the book he admits as much too. He acknowledges an element of good fortune in those two late, late goals his team scored to win the European Cup in Barcelona and he reflects: 'I think fate rewarded us.' Now, obviously it was luck. Obviously it was fate. Especially in the knock-out competitions, it always is in football - barring the rare emergence of a team that is blindingly superior to the rest, like Gullit's and Van Basten's Milan, Brazil in 1970, the great Real Madrid. Had Schmeichel decided to dive the other way in the FA Cup semi-final replay Bergkamp would have scored and Arsenal would have gone through; had the Bayern Munich players not kept hitting the bar and missing sitters in the second half of the European Cup final, Sheringham and Solksjaer would never have had their night to remember; had Simeone's 'goal' in the quarter-final well, one could go on citing such examples all day long. The big reason why Ferguson knows his team were lucky to win the Treble was the miraculous absence of injuries during virtually the entire second half of the season. 'Remarkable, and in that vital period going into the semi-final of the FA Cup, with all the fixtures piling up the way they were! Another unique part of it was that we did not have an easy Cup run. It was Middlesbrough, then Liverpool, then Fulham (who were flying at the time), then Chelsea and a replay, then Arsenal and a replay. Now, you need luck to get through that. Only one player missed the final because of injury, and that was Henning Berg. Which is very unusual. So that was luck. Aye, that was luck.' Ferguson is talking in the airy reception area of the main building at Manchester United's new training facility in the Cheshire countryside, 20 minutes' drive from Old Trafford. It is a long, low, sleek building of clean metallic lines and lots of glass, glass tinged turquoise blue. It is the sort of building you would expect to hear Norman Foster had designed; the sort of building a big international software firm would choose to set up its European research centre. Of a piece, in other words, with the modern, multinational, multimedia, multi-merchandising operation that Manchester United plc has become in the Ferguson era. Whatever it is they are paying the Scotsman, you feel, it can't be enough. Because, critical a part as luck may have played in his success, the statistics have a relentlessness about them during the past decade of his watch that tell you he himself must clearly be doing something right. It is a subject on which, sitting cross-legged in blue shorts and a white shirt embroidered with the initials 'AF', he is happy to expound. The first factor over which a manager can exercise some control which Ferguson mentions as key to his success, especially in that Treble season, is team spirit. 'You could sense that we were not going to lose games because of that team spirit. They've' (he searches for the word, he often pauses to search for the right word) 'they've enshrined that team spirit. It's a marvellous thing for a manager because that is what you try to create, because you're always looking for signs of a player's motivation, how they are reacting under pressure. Everyone was up.' Signs? What signs, precisely, did he look for? 'You have to be alert to players' behaviour patterns. How they come in every morning, how they behave with each other. Especially with the pressure on, especially in March and April. What I have to look for is if all of a sudden the atmosphere is too quiet and players, perhaps irrationally, lose their tempers, or have an argument about nothing in particular. Or players who keep going to the toilet, things like that.' Going to the toilet? 'Well, yes, but then you have to know your players' habits. Some players, actually, like Steve Bruce would always go to the toilet before a game. Just before a game. It came naturally to him. I mean, it was sort of like his superstition, because all players are always superstitious. What you have to look for is a change in the patterns and if you detect that you have to step in and make things smoother.' Ferguson has this reputation for playing mind games, for psyching out opponents. Whether it is deserved or not what becomes very clear very early into the conversation is that understanding and shaping his players' psychology - each and every player's psychology - is a very big part indeed of his notion of what the manager's job should be. Maybe, more than tactics or anything, the principal part. So, if he saw a player behaving strangely under pressure would he go and engage him in a one to one? 'Aye, aye. But you have to gauge things just right. Sometimes the excitement and tension is good for them. Sometimes it's too much. That depends on the personality. It varies from player to player. You have to observe, to know, to judge.' And when, having filtered the question through his refined thought processes, he decides to take a player aside for a chat, what does he say? Ferguson pauses to weigh up the question. Pondering, how much to give away no doubt; but also mindful, as he says, of the perception the players have of him, how some fear him, how some - as he acknowledges with what appears to be an element of sincere surprise - are 'frightened to death' of him. 'Well, now, if I am in a situation where I have to go to a player,' he says, indicating that this something he does not do often and, therefore, cannot be taken lightly, 'then I would try not to overwhelm him. I would probably say, \"Look\", in a general sense, \"look: trust yourself.\"' Ferguson's voice lowers as he does an imitation of himself talking privately to one of his players. He is confiding something important, something that is not only serious in his life, but solemn. His relationship with his players, those great-hearted team-spirited players that have given him so much, is terribly, terribly important to him. It is the very heart of him. Lowering his voice still further, whispering like a priest at confession, he continues: 'You know, it is a great word, \"trust\". You trust yourself and trust your team mates. That's the other half of it, you say. \"You know you've got these good players playing in your team. Trust them. You're in good hands.\"' But is it always true that they are in good hands? Don't players have off days? 'Aye but, you see, you see to win a game of football,' - abruptly he raises the volume, as if shaking himself out of this sensitive, slightly unmanly register he somehow strayed into, resuming the gruff, forthright persona he prefers to present to the world, - 'to win a game of football you need eight performers'. Eight? 'You need eight performing well. The other three can be carried along. They can be carried along even if it's your best player who's having a bad day. Because even if two or three players don't reach their level their influence is there, the commitment is so great that it keeps them all in the game.' Getting players 'to reach their level': is that a mystery or a science? 'The science is in the preparation. Because there are two things you have to try and get through in the training environment. One is an atmosphere in which the players enjoy training; the second thing is to provide a platform for them to develop all the time, so that the training sessions must be quality, encourage them to improve their performance. All my life I've felt it is my job to create an environment where players are enjoying training, they look forward to it. If you get that right and if you don't allow the quality to drop then you will see the results on Saturday.' He might have held these convictions all his life but, as he readily admits, well into his career he consciously refined his approach to coaching. 'Yes, 'I'd been 18 years in management, I had made my mark but I was prepared to change.' How? Surprisingly enough, it took a Frenchman to teach a Scot to renew his commitment to the work ethic. 'Cantona came to the club and after training he stayed behind to practise. Even in mid-winter. Amazing! I'll tell you a story. The night before we played Liverpool in the FA Cup Final, we were down at a hotel on the Thames. It was about nine o'clock. The players had already eaten and I was sitting with the staff having dinner, it was a lovely summer's evening, when I look outside and there's Cantona doing stretching exercises on the lawn.' Ferguson recalls the scene in hushed awe. 'That changed me. What Cantona added to my sense of the job, of management, was that ethic, which then became a foundation of my approach.' The other thing he learnt from Cantona was to spend more time in training practising with the ball. 'We always do it at the end of a session. Passing the ball to feet quickly, controlling the ball, crossing, finishing. I just stand and watch. It's terrific.' The principle is that players can always improve. 'It's a fallacy people have that players have this God-given talent and that's it, that they're a finished product at 18. A lot of players are late developers. Look at Zidane: what did we hear about him when he was 21, 22? We try to look for the finished product too early in this country. We keep talking about the great youth, at under-18 level. But if you go back the past two decades, all these great under-18 year-olds, how many have made it? How many make it as senior players?' One who did was Ryan Giggs, Manchester United's longest serving player. In The Unique Treble Ferguson recalls the wonder goal Giggs scored against Arsenal in the FA Cup semi-final and says: 'When I see Ryan Giggs performing as he did in this game there is not a player in the world to touch him.' To this day Ferguson recollects with wonder the first time he saw Giggs play, as a 13-year-old. 'It was the way he ran,' Ferguson says, looking into his mind's eye, oozing affection for Giggs, and for the beautiful game, 'the way he skipped over the ground, his head up like a cocker spaniel chasing a bit of silver paper around.' Young players are not always as easy to judge as Giggs was. What does he look for when someone brings him along a bright young prospect to examine? 'Well, of course, talent, ability, is the first attraction of any player. But just as important in the long run is to try and assess what kind of character he's got. Has he got the enthusiasm all the time? There is nothing better than seeing a fellow like Roy Keane, whose football ability is a result of the kind of passion he has. And then there is a player's character, and that you judge not in the dressing room but on the football field. There you see the true thing, because you can't hide out there. 'So character, enthusiasm and ability are the three important factors. There are other, ancillary things. Like balance and speed. They're important. These probably determine the great players. But what you want to make sure you get right are these other things: ability, character, enthusiasm.' There is another factor that has to be added to the mix these days, one that did not exist in the days when Ferguson was a player. The celebrity factor, the millionaire player factor, which has destroyed a number of players who had all the ability and enthusiasm in the world. 'Aye, aye,' Ferguson says, a little wearily. 'How a player's image has changed since, say, the Sixties! And how aware they are that they have this image to keep up, an image completely outside football. Which is why some will get a fancy car, some will wear an earring. So you have to say to yourself, at what point do I lose my control? At what point do I say, right, enough's enough? I am forever keeping an eye on this side of things, judging to see if it gets too much.' What are his criteria for deciding what is too much? He does not hesitate to answer. 'When it starts interfering with their performance.' And how can you be sure of relating one thing to another? Ferguson returns to his coach as psychologist persona. 'If you see them change dramatically as an individual, as a person. Because the last thing I want is to see them change. I want to see them keep their feet on the ground, I want to see that they appreciate where they're coming from, and I want to see them go back to their parents and their wives the same person. I don't want to see a lot of bigheads running about the place. Now, let me quickly add, their egos are no problem for me. Because people with egos win games for you.' The key question for him as a manager in this age of the celebrity footballer, as for all managers in top flight football everywhere, is - as he said - not to lose control. To obtain and keep the respect of individuals who have a far higher public profile than you do and who, in many cases, earn far more money. When you are talking of really top-class players, an added complication is presented by the fact that they know - and they know you know - that they are more indispensable to the club than you are. A recent case in point at one of the few clubs in the world that is on the same level as Manchester United was John Toshack at Real Madrid. Toshack was fired a year ago in large measure because he was bigger in size only than the club's star players, none of whom ever took him completely seriously. Ferguson is keenly aware of the syndrome in question. Surprisingly, he takes the attitude 'there but for the grace of God go I'. 'Yes, and you know, where I am lucky,' again he drops his voice confidentially, 'where I am lucky is that this celebrity phenomenon - these big changes in the relationship between the players and the clubs, the players and the managers - has taken place during my time at United. That is when these things have evolved. I was already in place, you see, when this transformation happened. So new players have come to the club, or young stars have come through, but because I have already been here a time, and been successful, they have had to prove themselves to me. I have had the control.' In other words, Ferguson would not like to be a manager in the position of having to arrive cold at a club like Manchester United, which is probably to a large degree why he has already recommended his assistant, Steve McLaren, as the man who should succeed him. Which will be in barely a year and a half, if Ferguson does not change his mind about retiring when he reaches 60. What he himself will do has been the subject of endless speculation. For now he has limited himself to saying he would like to stay within the club, perhaps playing some kind of international scouting and liaison role. More interesting, or at any rate just as interesting, is what will become of David Beckham then? Will the great debate - should he stay wide or play in central midfield - finally have been resolved? 'Well, obviously, when you've got maybe 35 per cent of your goals originating from Beckham you'd be crazy to go and take that thrust, that penetration away from the right hand side of the pitch. Right now, besides, he would compound my problem with the central midfielders I've already got.' Beckham himself has said he will move inside when Manchester United find a suitable replacement for him on the right. Is anyone around? 'Well, at the moment we have the young boy Chadwick who we're quite hopeful of. Greening could possibly play out there. Solksjaer could do too. But it's down to this. Could they operate as successfully as David Beckham?' The answer, clearly, is no. Though, partly to keep the opposition guessing, and partly to give him breathing space when the opposition close him down on the wing, Ferguson says he is encouraging him to move inside. 'Except when we get to the last third when I like him to get into a position where he can get his crosses in. Because he's been fantastic for us. Fantastic. He's concentrated for so long on that part of his game, worked on his technique with such application, that his range in his crosses is marvellous. Unbelievable. His width, his ability to use the ball so intelligently from there, his crossfield passes, his short passes, his chips. Unbelievable.' Ferguson becomes quite rhapsodic going through his maestro's repertoire, as he does talking about Giggs and Keane. The sense you get is that on the one hand, for all the hard-bittenness, the lust to win at all costs that he conveys, he is also a fan, a lover of the game for the game's sake; on the other you sense too that for all the stories of the blow-dryer treatment he gives recalcitrants at half-time, and all the rest of it, he really and truly loves his players. They are his children, his family, his pride and joy. He is their number one fan. Which is perhaps why Ferguson is at pains to stress that, like a good father, it is he who has fuelled Beckham's repeatedly stated desire to switch to a central playmaker role, to become the English Zidane. 'I have said to him in the past, you will not be the top-class player you want to be unless you add other things to your game. A new range. And it's happening already this season. I see him developing all the time. He is natural goalscorer who has not been scoring goals for a couple of seasons. Now we see it happening.' So, will he end up in central midfield? 'I think he will. I think there will come a time when his ability to control games will flourish and he will need to be in central midfield.' Which means that he will become a better player, as Zidane did with time. 'That's right, yes. What greater maturity brings is greater authority. In the period from now to probably till he is 30, 31, he'll add that authority to his game.' Which raises a conundrum. If Beckham is maturing and becoming a greater player, if - as he noted - Nicky Butt is also significantly improving his game, if he had virtually the same team now as won the Treble in 1999, most of them hovering around the 25-year-old mark and therefore approaching their peak, why were Manchester United faring so much more poorly in the Champions' League this season than they were back then? Ferguson bristles but does not quarrel with the analysis. He cannot quarrel with figures which show that in the first group phase in the Treble year, playing against Barcelona, Bayern and Brondby, his team scored 20 goals and topped the group; while this year, playing against Anderlecht, PSV and Dynamo Kiev they sneaked through in second, scoring only 11 goals. Was it that the famous Ferguson hunger was ebbing, what with writing all these nostalgic books and all? Gruffly he dismisses the suggestion. 'No, no, no. My hunger has not been sapped at all. Nor the players'. The truth is, I think this team has improved, is better than the one that won the Treble. But what I think we are finding now is that teams are preparing really well for us. They're not attacking us. They're beating us in the counter-attack. Like PSV away. They scored early, sat back, waited to strike back at us.' So what will he do? 'Well, simple things, like not going for the throat all the time. We're going to have to sit back and allow them to come to us, and that is going to require a bit of patience.' Can he really change the style of play of such a settled team? There is no can about it. Ferguson has judged that he must. He lost to PSV away; he lost to Anderlecht away; he would not have made it to the next round of the Champions' League had it not been for a great piece of good fortune - as Ars\u00e8ne Wenger no doubt would have been the first to note - in the home victory against Dynamo Kiev. None of this makes Ferguson happy. He grits his teeth. He's top of the Premiership but his team is not firing on all cylinders, in all competitions. Yes, he remains hungry for success, for excellence. So he grits his teeth, and says: 'We're going to change. We are going to change. Enough's enough. Enough's enough now.' Sir Alex Ferguson, wine connoisseur I had heard that Ferguson was a wine lover. I wasn't sure it was true but, just in case, on the way up to Manchester to interview him I stopped off at the airport duty free and bought him what I considered to be, within the limits of my humble budget, a fine bottle of red. It was not a wine that would be well known to your average, or even not so average, connoisseur. I just happened to have heard from reliable sources that it was good. It was a Pesquera 1996 Reserva, from the Spanish wine region of Ribera del Duero. Anyway, so there I am, 8.30 in the morning, at the reception area of the gleaming new Man United training centre, bottle in a plastic bag, when out pops Ferguson, bristling with animated purpose, like a man running late for an important appointment. It immediately becomes clear that the important appointment is not me. His secretary introduces me, we shake hands and I say something like 'How do you do?' 'Yeah.

When Robson arrived in summer 1994, we had just missed the Division One play-offs after having been relegated from the first Premiership the season before. In the following seasons, Robson got us promoted twice and took us to our first three major Wembley finals. We have, the Robbo faithful point out, put our 'whore's drawers' attitude to promotion and relegation behind us - as soon as we are up, we are down again - and are enjoying our most sustained run in the top flight since players such as David Hodgson, Spike Armstrong and Mark Proctor graced Ayresome Park. </p> <p>But the giveaway is there, even in Robson's defence. Sure, we've been to three Wembley finals but we've still won nowt. And two promotions? The first was necessary. We should never have needed to suffer the indignity of the second. I still can't believe we managed to get ourselves relegated in 1996-97, even allowing for the three points we had deducted, when we had players of the quality of Fabrizio Ravanelli, Juninho, Emerson and Nick Barmby. </p> <p>In fact, the truth about Robson is that he has done very little to take the club forward since 1998. We have ample evidence to indicate he is simply not up to the job. Behind Robbo is an infrastructure which must be the envy of many. We have the BTCellnet Riverside Stadium, new purpose-built training facilities, a youth system - although we are still awaiting our Beckhams and our Butts. </p> <p>Unlike his predecessors who had to sell our brightest and best to make ends meet, Robbo has not just had chairman Steve Gibson's millions to plunder but also his unwaning support. As a result, Robbo has spent more than \u00a370m since his arrival six seasons ago. Given that kind of outlay, we should at least be challenging for Europe, the benchmark of success in the modern game, yet the highest we have finished in the Premiership is ninth. </p> <p>In fact, Robson's current troubles are no surprise to the more discerning Boro fans who've had the misfortune to witness the woeful performances that Boro have put in over the past two seasons. Some of them were so inept that I felt I was getting off lightly being forced into exile by the government. At least I had a cast-iron excuse not to go. </p> <p>In fact, anyone who has managed to stay awake at the Riverside during the past two years will know that Robson has made some appalling tactical errors. A goal down with 20 minutes to go during one home game last season, our erstwhile coach took off Juninho, the one player who could make a difference. The response of the fans said it all: 'You don't know what you're doing,' they chanted as he stood there, frowning slightly, affecting his man-of-destiny pose. Since I have come back, I have seen nothing to call into question the view of the Boro fans. We only scraped a draw at home to Bradford because they were considerably worse than us. </p> <p>But what do we expect? Robbo belongs to an era when British footballers thought that libero and catenaccio belonged with 'tutti frutti' in the Gino Ginelli range. He is a dinosaur compared to his supposed mentor, Alex Ferguson or continentals such as Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and G\u00e9rard Houllier. </p> <p>That said, I respect his commitment to the club; his never-say-die attitude which he clearly tries to instil in his players; and his willingness to admit that he could have learned something alongside Terry Venables. </p> <p>After almost a week, the whole Venables initiative collapsed on Friday with Gibson apparently affirming that they had withdrawn the offer only for Venables to explain to a Fleet Street chum just why he had said no. Whether or not they should have indulged Venables's predictably sky-high demands remains to be seen. But it is worth pointing out that Middlesbrough enjoyed their brightest period under Robson when he was deputy England coach under El Tel.

So what now? Well, I wish Robson well for the future, a future where he will preferably learn his trade at Middlesbrough before once again leading us to new glories.

McNamara packed up his things at the BBC on Friday after news got out that he would be taking his expertise to ITV's successor to MOTD when the Premiership highlights show switches channels next season. </p> <p>There was grudging acceptance at the Beeb yesterday that ITV had made an astute signing. 'He's a serious player, who we're sad to lose,' said one Beeb insider, 'but where else did ITV have to go with their dearth of talent.' Ouch. </p> <p>ITV are expected to make further raids with additional commentators a high priority. Word is that John Motson need not apply, but agents to most of the other TV football commentators not already employed by ITV should be sharpening their negotiating skills as the cast for the new programme is assembled. </p> <p>Excellent though Motson is, ITV feel that if they are to make their show as distinctive as possible it would not be a good idea to open up with the voice most associated with MOTD. Sky's Martin Tyler and Alan Parry are reckoned to be foremost among the targeted commentators. </p> <p>The big one, the presenter's seat, is being kept vacant for Des Lynam, whose reservation about taking it is not the money, the mattress is already close to the ceiling, but the prospect of having to work Saturday evenings again. </p> <p>Which may be one of the reasons that ITV are lining up a mid-evening slot for the programme. They have promised to make it more family friendly, which means it will be earlier than MOTD's present starting time on the Beeb of 10.30pm. But it will not, as some reports have suggested, be bolted on to the afternoon show, Football First, which is being switched from ITV2 to ITV to take on the Saturday afternoon football coverage on Grandstand and on Sky. </p> <p>*****</p> <p>Glenn Hoddle and Chris Waddle are back in tandem - not, though, the nation will be pleased to know, as a singing partnership. </p> <p>The pair have been playing six-a-side football for England in the Masters Home Nations tournament, and before that they took part in the Masters club championship featuring top Premiership and Football League sides. </p> <p>Both these inaugural events for the 35 and overs have been popular with the players - Ian Wright, John Barnes, Neil Webb and Ally McCoist are others who have turned out - and with Sky viewers. </p> <p>The total audience of 7.5 million viewers who watched the regional play-offs and deciders represented a higher average than for Nationwide games. And, remarkably, the Scottish Masters drew an audience of 900,000, 50 per cent bigger than watched the Scottish FA Cup final. No wonder Sky have forked out a seven-figure sum for live rights for the next three years. </p> <p>*****</p> <p>Beckham v Peckham proved as disappointingly one-sided as many of Manchester United's matches this season. </p> <p>David and Posh, stars of The David Beckham Story last Wednesday on ITV, heavily outscored the BBC's main counter-attraction, Del Boy and Rodney manoeuvring for a girl's hand in an Only Fools and Horses rerun. Final score: the Beckhams more than 10 million, the Trotters fewer than five million. </p> <p>jon.henderson@observer.co.uk</p>",

      "bodyText": "It was an amicable parting, apparently, but Paul McNamara was not around last night to fulfil his duties as senior producer on Match of the Day. McNamara packed up his things at the BBC on Friday after news got out that he would be taking his expertise to ITV's successor to MOTD when the Premiership highlights show switches channels next season. There was grudging acceptance at the Beeb yesterday that ITV had made an astute signing. 'He's a serious player, who we're sad to lose,' said one Beeb insider, 'but where else did ITV have to go with their dearth of talent.' Ouch. ITV are expected to make further raids with additional commentators a high priority. Word is that John Motson need not apply, but agents to most of the other TV football commentators not already employed by ITV should be sharpening their negotiating skills as the cast for the new programme is assembled. Excellent though Motson is, ITV feel that if they are to make their show as distinctive as possible it would not be a good idea to open up with the voice most associated with MOTD. Sky's Martin Tyler and Alan Parry are reckoned to be foremost among the targeted commentators. The big one, the presenter's seat, is being kept vacant for Des Lynam, whose reservation about taking it is not the money, the mattress is already close to the ceiling, but the prospect of having to work Saturday evenings again. Which may be one of the reasons that ITV are lining up a mid-evening slot for the programme. They have promised to make it more family friendly, which means it will be earlier than MOTD's present starting time on the Beeb of 10.30pm. But it will not, as some reports have suggested, be bolted on to the afternoon show, Football First, which is being switched from ITV2 to ITV to take on the Saturday afternoon football coverage on Grandstand and on Sky. ***** Glenn Hoddle and Chris Waddle are back in tandem - not, though, the nation will be pleased to know, as a singing partnership. The pair have been playing six-a-side football for England in the Masters Home Nations tournament, and before that they took part in the Masters club championship featuring top Premiership and Football League sides. Both these inaugural events for the 35 and overs have been popular with the players - Ian Wright, John Barnes, Neil Webb and Ally McCoist are others who have turned out - and with Sky viewers. The total audience of 7.5 million viewers who watched the regional play-offs and deciders represented a higher average than for Nationwide games. And, remarkably, the Scottish Masters drew an audience of 900,000, 50 per cent bigger than watched the Scottish FA Cup final. No wonder Sky have forked out a seven-figure sum for live rights for the next three years. ***** Beckham v Peckham proved as disappointingly one-sided as many of Manchester United's matches this season. David and Posh, stars of The David Beckham Story last Wednesday on ITV, heavily outscored the BBC's main counter-attraction, Del Boy and Rodney manoeuvring for a girl's hand in an Only Fools and Horses rerun. Final score: the Beckhams more than 10 million, the Trotters fewer than five million. jon.henderson@observer.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>The Ipswich Town manager was trying to play down the team's chances, trying to keep both their quality and achievements in perspective. 'We are ordinary players concentrating on simple things,' he said. That manager was Alf Ramsey and it was 1962, just before that astonishing day, Saturday 28 April, when Ipswich won the Championship for the only time in their history. 'Wonderful little Ipswich Town, the miracle team of all time,' said, forgivably, that night's local Football Star of their heroes, who had been promoted only 12 months earlier. </p> <p>A Scotsman he may be but George Burley is clearly of the same Suffolk stock. 'We are playing every week against players individually much higher profile and at times better quality, but football's about the team and that's what Ipswich is about,' says the current Ipswich manager, advocate of doing the simple things well and of practice making perfect. </p> <p>History repeating itself? Unlikely. Sadly in many ways, the game has moved on significantly since a team could come up and outperform the big clubs. Those 38 years ago the impact of the abolition of the maximum wage had not yet fully bitten while shared gate revenue between home and away teams ensured more parity of resources. </p> <p>Still, Burley's Tractor Boys - a new nickname embraced reluctantly by the Portman Road traditionalists - are having a fair stab at emulating Ramsey's Rustics. Their ascent to the top three of the Premiership has been a refreshing early-season highlight, especially considering their promotion only by the play-off position - traditionally the route to immediate relegation. </p> <p>In the Nineties, history was a millstone to Ipswich. After Alf, a statue of whom now stands outside the stadium on the corner of Sir Alf Ramsey Way, came Bobby Robson, whose teams won the FA Cup and, during the course of nine seasons in Europe, the Uefa Cup. Inspired by Frans Thijssen and Arnold Muhren, they also played some of the most beautiful football in the English game during the late Seventies and early Eighties, being probably the best side not to win the title in that period. </p> <p>All the while, the club was run with dignity and charm by the benign Cobbold family. The welcome was always one of the warmest and most hospitable. Then came the Premiership. Its cold cityscape was not designed for naifs from towns with populations of 120,000. When they fell five seasons ago, thereafter to flounder annually in the play-offs, it seemed they could become yet another former-glory Nationwide name. </p> <p>'The Cobbolds were wonderful people but if you were a fan and had seen us relegated badly, losing 9-0 to Manchester United, quite frankly the quotes about a crisis at this club being when the white wine runs out in the boardroom wear a bit thin,' says the current chairman and chief executive, the Diet Cola-drinking David Sheepshanks. 'We have tried to turn our glorious history into more of a springboard for the future.' </p> <p>Sheepshanks and his board took stock after the '95 debacle, when Ipswich were relegated with 27 points, the same number they had already going into yesterday's game against Derby County. They looked at the manager, the playing staff, commercial strategy, public relations, community involvement and the youth set-up. 'We were doing pretty poorly in that,' Sheepshanks admits. 'Now we have 28 centres all over East Anglia.' Their under-17 academy side is top of its Premiership competition. The single most important task is to get the right manager. Hopefully, it's not a decision we take very often at this club.' </p> <p>Indeed, they are a manager's dream; he knows he will get time. Burley, a player under Robson for 14 years - 'Blue-and-white in his veins, as much as me or the most ardent supporter,' says Sheepshanks - will celebrate six years in charge this month. </p> <p>'There are always bad results or spells and in the first two years in the First Division particularly we didn't start well,' says Sheepshanks. 'There were a lot of people grumbling. But these were early days. We were confident we had the right man, an Ipswich Town man. Every year the resolve hardened and to anyone who was impatient, we just said, \"Look at the tangible signs of improvement.\" </p> <p>'Last March, we sat down and asked ourselves, \"God forbid we should fail again, but what do we feel?\" It didn't take very long to decide George was still the man to improve Ipswich. We gave him a new four-year contract. We put our money where our mouth is.' </p> <p>There is such a thing as Ipswich football, Sheepshanks agrees, and Burley's team play it. 'We want to join in from the back, we want to pass it, we want to get forward and play the right way,' says Burley himself. 'We are competitive and very disciplined [Ipswich have the best displinary record in the Premiership]. You are brought up in a certain manner here and now, as a manager, I have added my own ideas.' </p> <p>When they beat Coventry City to reach the Worthington Cup quarter-finals last week it was noticeable how they immediately snapped into the game with the air of men who expect now to win matches, unlike the previous Premiership campaign when there was an acquiescent weariness to them. </p> <p>Theirs is a mixture of outrageous promise and guileful experience, with an impressive spine comprising Richard Wright, the powerful Titus Bramble (who looks like the love child of Kevin Beattie and Marion Jones and will surely go on to win caps for England), Matt Holland, Jim Magilton and Marcus Stewart. </p> <p>'No doubt it makes it easier if you spend a lot of money but it's getting the right ones and right balance,' says Burley. 'We want the right ones for the jigsaw, players who will work hard for each other.' As he knows though, it is hugely about quality, too. </p> <p>'We think we have got some very good players who have shown their quality,' he adds. 'In the Premiership we have been able to express ourselves more. In the First Division, teams came to stop us playing. Here, teams want to win games and it's a bit more open. Maybe in the Premiership they don't worry so much about Ipswich.' </p> <p>So what can be achieved? 'We look at Leicester, who have twice won the Worthington Cup and played in Europe,' says Sheepshanks. 'I also take a leaf out of the books of European clubs like Auxerre, who rebuild themselves from their youth academy, Lens, Rosenborg and Heerenveen. They are provincial clubs, well managed on and off the field, who qualify for Europe. </p> <p>'We haven't got the financial clout of Manchester United and Arsenal and I doubt we ever will have, but we have got a catchment area of a million to a million- and-half in Suffolk and Essex. We can support a 30,000-plus stadium and there's a new stand going up. I don't see any reason why we can't be in Europe within three years.' </p> <p>He told the AGM as much recently and there seems to have been more assent there than at Chelsea's on Friday, with shareholders happy that any dividend is going back into the club. Stewart came last season for \u00a32.5 million, Hermann Hreidarsson this season for \u00a34.5m and there is more available. 'This isn't a rehearsal,' says Sheepshanks. </p> <p>Reality will undoubtedly bite soon. Injuries and suspensions will test the depth of squad, the opposition will have learned lessons for return matches. Ipswich themselves insist they are not getting carried away, Sheepshanks recalling being fourth in January '93 before finishing 16th, which would still represent a successful season this time. </p> <p>In the meantime, let us say what modesty forbids them. It is a time to celebrate simplicity, sanity and success in Suffolk amid the bigger, richer, emptier vessels who make more noise. They remain a pleasure to visit.

And this assessment of him from Stanley Mortensen's 'Football is my Game': 'Shackleton and Hagan are high-class players, with this similarity: they can both rise to the very heights of brilliance.

He has all the qualities that go to make up an international inside-forward, but some say too prone to use tricks. </p> <p>'When you first see him, with his clever little feints, his extraordinary facility for the back-heel pass, and his flair for running into position, you think there couldn't possibly be a better inside-forward.

Tricksy, clever, moody: Len Shackleton was a must-pick. It mattered not a jot that I had never seen him. He was a fantasy footballer decades before Fantasy Football. A footballer from a different age. </p> <p>And it is possible we shall not imagine his like again for football has changed radically since Shack's day. His book is sub-titled A Personal, Retrospective Anthology by Len Shackleton ('From a game with a business in it, to a business with a game in it!'). And it is Sky who are primarily responsible for this change in priorities. Sky who have ensured, by broadcasting every goal of every match, that the aural tradition will be eroded and replaced inexorably by a visual one. That when we talk of football we will talk of BP (Before Premiership) and 1992 will henceforth be regarded as Anno Premiership. </p> <p>Now, in the year 8AP, we are already under attack from a barrage of Premiership-only statistics: 'This might be Tottenham's twenty-third away win in the Premiership... that's Derby's one hundredth Premiership goal... that's the one thousandth one-nil scoreline since the Premiership began. </p> <p>Within a decade there will be a flurry of football writers and pundits who will have had no first-hand experience of the 'old' first division. Who will only know the new glitzy world of the Premiership. A world where ITV clears the prime-time decks for 'an end of the day' documentary the highlight of which is David Beckham making pasta for Gary Neville and an as yet unidentified third man. A world where one of the first acts of a national newspaper owner is to demand that his employees refer to self-same footballer and his wife by their proper names. No more Posh and Becks, now it must be David and Victoria or Vihctoria or however David decides to tattoo it. A world where footballers will leave a blank page in their books not in order to make a sardonic comment about football directors' knowledge of the game but to free up some space for a Nike logo. A world where the average family's third biggest weekly outgoing is paying cable and TV subscriptions. We are spending three-and-a-half times in the year 8AP as we did in 3AP. Who cares if there is no food on the table if Shell's Wonderful World of Golf is on the telly? </p> <p>Last Tuesday night the Sunderland fans at the Stadium of Light paid respects to Len Shackleton with a minute's silence. Sky missed it due to an ad break. No problem, they just asked the fans to do it again. The viewers didn't miss a thing.</p>",

Sky who have ensured, by broadcasting every goal of every match, that the aural tradition will be eroded and replaced inexorably by a visual one. That when we talk of football we will talk of BP (Before Premiership) and 1992 will henceforth be regarded as Anno Premiership. Now, in the year 8AP, we are already under attack from a barrage of Premiership-only statistics: 'This might be Tottenham's twenty-third away win in the Premiership... that's Derby's one hundredth Premiership goal... that's the one thousandth one-nil scoreline since the Premiership began. Within a decade there will be a flurry of football writers and pundits who will have had no first-hand experience of the 'old' first division. Who will only know the new glitzy world of the Premiership. A world where ITV clears the prime-time decks for 'an end of the day' documentary the highlight of which is David Beckham making pasta for Gary Neville and an as yet unidentified third man. A world where one of the first acts of a national newspaper owner is to demand that his employees refer to self-same footballer and his wife by their proper names. No more Posh and Becks, now it must be David and Victoria or Vihctoria or however David decides to tattoo it. A world where footballers will leave a blank page in their books not in order to make a sardonic comment about football directors' knowledge of the game but to free up some space for a Nike logo. A world where the average family's third biggest weekly outgoing is paying cable and TV subscriptions. We are spending three-and-a-half times in the year 8AP as we did in 3AP. Who cares if there is no food on the table if Shell's Wonderful World of Golf is on the telly? Last Tuesday night the Sunderland fans at the Stadium of Light paid respects to Len Shackleton with a minute's silence. Sky missed it due to an ad break. No problem, they just asked the fans to do it again. The viewers didn't miss a thing.",

As she said: 'They looked so confident - they almost strutted into the ground.' </p> <p>That was our second defeat by Ipswich in successive weeks and, having studied videos of both games, I would say that the word 'confidence' is the one that best sums up the reason for the gulf between the two teams in the table. I cannot believe that Ipswich are a better team than Coventry, if only because of the fact that we created more scoring chances than they did over the two games. However, when it comes to applauding what Ipswich have done, I am happy to clap my hands as enthusiastically as anyone. </p> <p>At the start of the season, I was one of many people in the game who felt that Ipswich, the smallest of the three promoted clubs, would have the most problems in holding their own. It was an obvious conclusion, given that Ipswich did not get automatic promotion. I personally felt that Manchester City would be the most successful of the trio because of their tremendous support, and it seemed that Charlton also had more going for them than Ipswich through their recent Premiership experience. </p> <p>That I have been proved wrong just goes to show the extent to which some good results can cause teams to catch fire. It also emphasises the importance of middle-of-the-range clubs having settled teams. I have long maintained that this really is the key. For example, it was no coincidence that during Coventry's great run three seasons ago, when we won eight and drew eight of our last 18 league matches and reached the FA Cup quarter-finals, we were virtually injury-free. </p> <p>There have been very few changes to Ipswich's first-team squad over the last 18 months. Even when Ipswich clinched promotion to the Premiership, the manager George Burley took the view that his players deserved the opportunity to show that they could take the club further; and having started off on the right foot, their self-esteem has soared. Of course, this is by no means the first time that Ipswich have belied their 'country cousins' image. They did so emphatically during that remarkable spell under the management of Bobby Robson. I have good cause to remember that wonderful side; I was with Aberdeen then, and one of the highlights of my career there was our Uefa Cup victory over Ipswich - then the holders - in the 1981-82 first round. </p> <p>It was something of a benchmark for us - tangible proof that, after being hammered by Liverpool in the European Cup the previous season, we were starting to get to grips with what was required to succeed in Europe. Although Aberdeen went out to Hamburg in the third round of the 1981-82 Uefa Cup, the following season they lifted the European Cup-Winners Cup. </p> <p>As for the present Ipswich side, one thing which strikes me about them is that they are strong physically. This certainly applies to their central defender, Titus Bramble, a tremendous athlete. Moreover, while I would not describe their football as being in the cosmic category in terms of dribbling and passing, they are far from mugs with the ball. Perhaps their cleverest player is the highly-experienced Jim Magilton in midfield. Others who have made a big impression are their Dutch right-back Fabian Wilnis, left-side midfielder, Jamie Clapham, and centre-forward Jamie Scowcroft. On the occasions that Ipswich are not able to play through Magilton, then Scowcroft's ability to make something of a longer ball clearly comes in handy. </p> <p>He seems to me to be doing an exceptional job for them. There can be no doubts on that score with Burley. I am delighted for him, not least because he once operated behind me in the Scotland team - a job that many would argue is liable to knock years off a right-back's career. He was an excellent player - he epitomised what I was saying earlier about the importance of footballers doing the simple things well. Not surprisingly, it is well reflected by his team.</p>",

      "byline": "Amy Lawrence",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Fast forward four games. Easy pickings against Manchester City and Derby at home, Middlesbrough away, then Bradford at the Bridge. Got to be at least 10 points out of 12, and all of a sudden Chelsea are back in upper-mid-table respectability, a position that shouldn't cause Marcel Desailly too much embarrassment. Confidence returns, morale is mended, Claudio Ranieri buys himself a smidgen more respect, and perhaps they can forget the troubles of the past few weeks. Ten points out of 12 against struggling and eminently beatable opposition. You'd bet Ken Bates a pound that a squad who earn almost \u00a350 million a year will come good wouldn't you? You know you should. But you just can't. </p> <p>In the space of six months Chelsea have slithered from Premiership contenders who strengthened their squad impressively in the summer to turmoil. Their demise has been accompanied by a cacophony of sniggering, bitching and blame. Given that one of the fundamental reasons Chelsea bid farewell to Gianluca Vialli was that a clutch of players abandoned faith in him, there were ominous grindings on the rumour mill last week about Ranieri having 'lost' a couple of players. </p> <p>It has been a particularly turbulent few days, what with the sour departures of Graham Rix, Ray Wilkins, Antonio Pintus and Eddie Niedzwiecki, backroom staff who have done little but put on their tracksuits under the new regime. Reading between the lines, Ranieri would clearly have preferred a clear-out the day he was appointed. </p> <p>Keeping Vialli's men around the place was supposed to ease the transition, but only bred frustration and suspicion. Mix in the admission from one player that team meetings are conducted in four languages, the feeling that the team's average age appears to be 46, the fact that the midfield is desperately short of balance (Mario Stanic has been out since August, Roberto Di Matteo will be lucky to play again, Gus Poyet was never happy on the wing), and it's not so surprising they can't win away. </p> <p>While Chelsea fans are rightly disillusioned, the rest of the football fraternity is having a good giggle. The combination of flashing the cash and filling the team with foreigners provoked enough resentment and jealousy when they were winning; now they are losing, they are the butt of sneering criticism. </p> <p>So who got them into this fine mess? At whom do the Chelsea faithful point the finger? Is it the fault of foreign mercenaries? Is it Ranieri and his band of translators? Is it the decision to sack Vialli instead of egoistical players who wouldn't respond to him? </p> <p>The club's power brokers, chairman Ken Bates and chief executive Colin Hutchinson, have to take responsibility. They deserved acclaim when their masterplan to transform their club from mediocrity to medal-hunters reaped five trophies in two seasons. Now it is up to them to get Chelsea out of this slump. They have seen many managers, and many more players, come and go. If Ranieri works out they can pat themselves on the back. If not, no doubt the fans will let them know if they are trusted to try out another new direction. </p> <p>They have chopped and changed the ethos - from Hoddle to Gullit to Vialli to Ranieri - because they are impatient for success. They have towering expectations, a high share price to aim for, and they don't want to wait around. And this is what happens when you press the brakes after sudden acceleration. Chelsea's remarkable rise in the late 90s was sudden and seductive, but ultimately the short-cut policy devised by Bates and Hutchinson lacked the substance to last. </p> <p>If Chelsea had managed to regenerate and invigorate the squad while they were on the up (see Manchester United) they might have avoided this predicament. But if you go for the quick fix, the chances are the Sellotape will start to peel soon enough. Now they require major repairs to a squad dominated by fading stars and the question is: Will Bates and Hutchinson be able to take Chelsea back among the Champions League contenders, or will they 'do a Blackburn' and plummet downwards? </p> <p>The halcyon days came thanks to imported legends who brought ability and instant credibility, but those players are running out of steam and there is little in reserve. It was a sign of how grateful the thirtysomethings were to fitness guru Antonio Pintus, who clearly helped them to extend their sell-by dates, that last week, when the gang of four were shown the door, Dennis Wise went to see the manager on behalf of the players to beg for him to be kept on. Ranieri was worried it would look like pro-Italian favouritism if the only member of Vialli's staff to stay was Pintus, but agreed to Wise's request because he had never seen players fight so hard for someone to be retained. In the end Pintus chose to go his own way and left. </p> <p>Whether or not Ranieri proves to be the man to hoist Chelsea back up, the board at least need to give him a chance. Hutchinson says funds are available both for big names and hungry youngsters. Ranieri has profited from introducing budding starlets in the past and appreciates the need to do so again: 'I have always inserted young players into the equation. When I arrived at Napoli I put Zola straight into the team. Two years ago at Valencia I didn't play with Romario, I played Mendieta and Lopez.' Any Chelsea veterans going through the motions will not last long. </p> <p>Ranieri is fiercely driven. Critical eyes will home in on the Italian in the dugout this afternoon but the pressure is of no concern to him. He claims not to feel a thing. He harkens back to a lesson which made a huge impression when he undertook his managerial training course: 'The first thing they said to us is \"You are like a parachutist jumping out of an aeroplane, and sometimes the parachute doesn't open.\" I've worked in places where they haven't even given me a parachute.' At Chelsea, he quips, he is armed with little more than an umbrella. </p> <p>He comes across as a quirky character.

      "bodyText": "Fast forward four games. Easy pickings against Manchester City and Derby at home, Middlesbrough away, then Bradford at the Bridge. Got to be at least 10 points out of 12, and all of a sudden Chelsea are back in upper-mid-table respectability, a position that shouldn't cause Marcel Desailly too much embarrassment. Confidence returns, morale is mended, Claudio Ranieri buys himself a smidgen more respect, and perhaps they can forget the troubles of the past few weeks. Ten points out of 12 against struggling and eminently beatable opposition. You'd bet Ken Bates a pound that a squad who earn almost \u00a350 million a year will come good wouldn't you? You know you should. But you just can't. In the space of six months Chelsea have slithered from Premiership contenders who strengthened their squad impressively in the summer to turmoil. Their demise has been accompanied by a cacophony of sniggering, bitching and blame. Given that one of the fundamental reasons Chelsea bid farewell to Gianluca Vialli was that a clutch of players abandoned faith in him, there were ominous grindings on the rumour mill last week about Ranieri having 'lost' a couple of players. It has been a particularly turbulent few days, what with the sour departures of Graham Rix, Ray Wilkins, Antonio Pintus and Eddie Niedzwiecki, backroom staff who have done little but put on their tracksuits under the new regime. Reading between the lines, Ranieri would clearly have preferred a clear-out the day he was appointed. Keeping Vialli's men around the place was supposed to ease the transition, but only bred frustration and suspicion. Mix in the admission from one player that team meetings are conducted in four languages, the feeling that the team's average age appears to be 46, the fact that the midfield is desperately short of balance (Mario Stanic has been out since August, Roberto Di Matteo will be lucky to play again, Gus Poyet was never happy on the wing), and it's not so surprising they can't win away. While Chelsea fans are rightly disillusioned, the rest of the football fraternity is having a good giggle. The combination of flashing the cash and filling the team with foreigners provoked enough resentment and jealousy when they were winning; now they are losing, they are the butt of sneering criticism. So who got them into this fine mess? At whom do the Chelsea faithful point the finger? Is it the fault of foreign mercenaries? Is it Ranieri and his band of translators? Is it the decision to sack Vialli instead of egoistical players who wouldn't respond to him? The club's power brokers, chairman Ken Bates and chief executive Colin Hutchinson, have to take responsibility. They deserved acclaim when their masterplan to transform their club from mediocrity to medal-hunters reaped five trophies in two seasons. Now it is up to them to get Chelsea out of this slump. They have seen many managers, and many more players, come and go. If Ranieri works out they can pat themselves on the back. If not, no doubt the fans will let them know if they are trusted to try out another new direction. They have chopped and changed the ethos - from Hoddle to Gullit to Vialli to Ranieri - because they are impatient for success. They have towering expectations, a high share price to aim for, and they don't want to wait around. And this is what happens when you press the brakes after sudden acceleration. Chelsea's remarkable rise in the late 90s was sudden and seductive, but ultimately the short-cut policy devised by Bates and Hutchinson lacked the substance to last. If Chelsea had managed to regenerate and invigorate the squad while they were on the up (see Manchester United) they might have avoided this predicament. But if you go for the quick fix, the chances are the Sellotape will start to peel soon enough. Now they require major repairs to a squad dominated by fading stars and the question is: Will Bates and Hutchinson be able to take Chelsea back among the Champions League contenders, or will they 'do a Blackburn' and plummet downwards? The halcyon days came thanks to imported legends who brought ability and instant credibility, but those players are running out of steam and there is little in reserve. It was a sign of how grateful the thirtysomethings were to fitness guru Antonio Pintus, who clearly helped them to extend their sell-by dates, that last week, when the gang of four were shown the door, Dennis Wise went to see the manager on behalf of the players to beg for him to be kept on. Ranieri was worried it would look like pro-Italian favouritism if the only member of Vialli's staff to stay was Pintus, but agreed to Wise's request because he had never seen players fight so hard for someone to be retained. In the end Pintus chose to go his own way and left. Whether or not Ranieri proves to be the man to hoist Chelsea back up, the board at least need to give him a chance. Hutchinson says funds are available both for big names and hungry youngsters. Ranieri has profited from introducing budding starlets in the past and appreciates the need to do so again: 'I have always inserted young players into the equation. When I arrived at Napoli I put Zola straight into the team. Two years ago at Valencia I didn't play with Romario, I played Mendieta and Lopez.' Any Chelsea veterans going through the motions will not last long. Ranieri is fiercely driven. Critical eyes will home in on the Italian in the dugout this afternoon but the pressure is of no concern to him. He claims not to feel a thing. He harkens back to a lesson which made a huge impression when he undertook his managerial training course: 'The first thing they said to us is \"You are like a parachutist jumping out of an aeroplane, and sometimes the parachute doesn't open.\" I've worked in places where they haven't even given me a parachute.' At Chelsea, he quips, he is armed with little more than an umbrella. He comes across as a quirky character. It is a shame conversation with the English media is stilted because apparently communication is one of his greatest assets. But learning a completely new language at the age of 47 is no mean feat and he has two-hour lessons four days a week, with particular emphasis on footballspeak. 'There is one type if pressure in England and one type of pressure in Italy. The pressure in Italy is much, much worse,' he shrugs. 'Maybe your team is attacking, the other team breaks and scores a goal, and you're sacked. That's what happens. I have learned in those circumstances to concentrate on my work and not worry about the pressure that comes from the press.' At the moment Ranieri is being judged on the group he has inherited and we probably won't see his true potential as a Premiership manager until he has assembled a squad he can call his own - and had the chance to put his troops through a rigorous pre-season, which he views as fundamental to a successful season.

      "bodyText": "1 Eilat The Red Sea resort of Eilat has excellent beaches, clear warm sea, and superb diving and watersports facilities. Excursions over the Jordanian border to Petra, and to Sinai in Egypt are popular. A seven-night stay at the five-star Crowne Plaza with breakfast costs \u00a3454 per person from Pullman Holidays (08700 133085). Return flights are included but you must depart on 7 January. 2 Marrakesh Morocco is just a three-hour flight away. Temperatures are in the high 50s or low 60s in winter, which is perfect when you explore the historic town. And allow time to relax by the pool before the sun sets. For \u00a3397 per person you gettwo nights B&amp;B at the four-star Nassim Hotel, including return flights from Gatwick, from Cresta Holidays (0870 161 0930). 3 Goa Once a Portuguese colony, Goa provides an enticing mix of Indian and Portuguese cultures that make the 11-hour flight seem worth it once you arrive. Prices are cheap and there is almost no rain at this time of year but some may find the contrast of luxury hotels and relative Indian poverty unsettling. Hayes &amp; Jarvis (0870 89 89 890) is offering a seven-night stay in the Alphaville Hotel with breakfast and return flights from Gatwick for \u00a3487 if you depart between 11 and 18 January. 4 Havana Cuba's capital has been described as a museum to a broken communist dream but a look beyond the crumbling buildings reveals a vibrant and fascinating city. The Cubans love to dance, and the many salsa clubs around the main square and the world famous Tropical Cabaret are an exhilarating experience. The three-star Accor Seville Hotel is in the centre of the city and the Online Travel Company (0870 887 0100) is offering a six-night stay for \u00a3499. This price includes breakfast and return flights from Gatwick but you must depart before 15 December. 5 Florida In Disney World the sun is always shining. When Mickey Mouse gets too much, Universal Studios is close by. America Direct (0870 789 3334) is offering a five-night stay at the Quality Inn Plaza from \u00a3337 per person on a room-only basis. You must depart between 1 and 18 January. 6 Egypt Luxor was the ancient Egyptians' Holy City and the area contains the largest concentration of ruins in the world. The hotels in and around Luxor generally have outdoor swimming pools for basking by when the throngs get a little too much. The Pharaon Hotel is on the Nile, near Karnak Temple, and costs \u00a3299 per person including return flights from Gatwick and breakfast for departures between 8 and 22 January. Contact Hayes &amp; Jarvis (0870 89 89 890). 7 Las Vegas Las Vegas is built slap-bang in the middle of the Mojave desert so if you lose your shirt in one of the casinos along the Strip, it will be warm enough to sunbathe without it. The city is surrounded by nothing but sand and cacti but why leave when you have miniature versions of Paris, Luxor and Venice to explore? For departures between January and 4 April you can stay for five nights at the Gold Coast Hotel on a room-only basis for \u00a3447, including return flights, with Thomson Breakaway Cities (0870 606 1476). 8 Nile cruises Week-long trips down the Nile are readily available for under \u00a3500 in winter. A typical cruise, available through Voyages Of Discovery (01444 462150), sails from Luxor to Aswan for \u00a3439 per person. The seven-night tour calls at Luxor, Karnak, Esna, Edfu, Aswan and Kom Ombo with excursions to the Temples of Luxor and Karnak and the impressive Abu Simbel. All meals are included, as are return flights from Gatwick, with the price based on two sharing and departing before 18 December. 9 The Algarve The distinctive orange sandstone cliffs and a hundred miles of sandy beaches make Portugal's southern coast a tempting prospect. Many of the fishing villages along the coast have become busy resorts but you don't have to venture too far inland to find almond groves and walled market towns. The Travel Club Of Upminster (01708 225000) is offering seven nights with breakfast at the Hotel Garbe for \u00a3294 per person if you depart between 7 and 21 January. 10 Tenerife In the early twentieth century, Tenerife was visited by ladies and gentlemen of gentility for a winter health cure.

Whatever you do in New Zealand it is very traveller-friendly. Do not miss out on a glacier hike on either Franz Josef or Fox glacier (a full day hike is a must!). The skydive over Taupo is also excellent and the cheapest in the world. Anyway, bye for now. Have a great time.",

      "body": "<p> Last summer was one long learning curve. I thought I knew about travelling in developing countries. I knew that journeys can be tough, but sagely told people that there is always something, whether it is the journey or what lies at the end of it, that redeems it. </p> <p>I had never been to sub-Saharan Africa. My fianc\u00e9 and I met each other in China, and we imagined that West Africa could be no more stressful than travelling in Asia. We took six weeks off, and set off for an adventure. We returned wiser, thinner, and much less smug. </p> <p>I was highly excited about a four-day journey in Mali, down the Niger in a steamboat to Timbuktu. Katharine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart in The African Queen sprang to mind. I would lounge languidly on the deck, while Timbuktu shimmered on the horizon. I had vaguely heard that, when you get there, it can disappoint, but put that conveniently to the back of my mind. </p> <p> <strong>Tuesday</strong></p> <p>This battered boat would tower over the African Queen. It was built in 1964, but it seems to float. It awaits us on the Niger, at Koulikoro, the port town nearest to Mali's capital, Bamako. Excitement is in the air. This is the first boat of the rainy season: the service only operates when there is enough water in the river - usually between August and January - to make it navigable. The roads round here are often impassable, and the steamboat moves faster than the wooden fishing boats we see throughout the journey. </p> <p>We spend the afternoon negotiating the bureaucracy involved in buying tickets. There are forms to be completed, pieces of paper to carry from one functionary to another, cash to be handed over. We were considering travelling third or fourth class - huddling on the decks with the vast majority of the African travellers - but we lose our nerve and book a first-class cabin. The heat is intense, and we like the idea of privacy, air conditioning, and access to loos and showers that are shared with the few others in first class. Meals are included. </p> <p>As I open the cabin door, and the smell hits me, I know we've made a mistake. There is no romance here. We edge inside. The linoleum beneath our feet is sticky. It has buckled, presumably under weather induced duress, and it rarely touches the floor. In the eight months the ferry has been out of commission, cleaning has not been a priority. James sets off to find someone to take away the dismantled loo that fills the floor. </p> <p>'The sheets look clean,' I tell myself. The air conditioning is not working, because the engine is off. </p> <p>Outside, the people of Koulikoro have set up stalls selling anything one might need for the journey. The chatter outside goes on past midnight. Departure is scheduled for 6am. </p> <p><strong>Wednesday</strong></p> <p>It's too hot to sleep. Our window doesn't open, because of the air conditioning. I bless the woven fan we bought for 10p in a village last week; but whenever I stop fanning, I am wide awake. Sweat pours off me and there is no air. </p> <p>At 6am I venture onto the deck and breathe deeply. We are gliding down the river in a stately manner. The sky and the water are both silver. There is a slight breeze, and the banks are deeply green. I watch Africa drift by. From time to time we pass clusters of huts which form remote settlements. The rest of the time there is nothing. I could be on the African Queen. I think it's going to be all right. </p> <p>The air conditioning hasn't come on. After breakfast - bread and jam, with a guffaw from the laconic waiter when James enquires about butter - we politely ask the captain why our expensive cabin resembles a stinking furnace. He cheerfully explains that the aircon in first class hasn't worked for years. 'Oui, c'est domage,' he agrees. </p> <p>I dangle my legs through the railings and exchange idle pleasantries with the African family on one side and Christophe and Sandrine on the other. The passing landscape is flat and green. Mali is one of the world's poorest countries, suffering both from desertification and from the after-effects of the Sahel drought of the Sixties and Seventies. </p> <p>It swiftly becomes clear that most of the 400 or so passengers prefer to use the first-class loos, partly, perhaps, because they are European style. Whatever the reason, they have been blocked since before we left the port, and we are usually downwind of them. Meanwhile, the showers, which dispense river water, only occasionally work, and appear to double up as extra toilets. On the rare occasions I get to shower, I keep my sandals on. </p> <p>The people on the upper deck fling the contents of their children's potties overboard with merry abandon. Their deck is set back from ours, so everything they throw lands directly on top of us. This factor, combined with the stench, drives us back into the cabin regularly, until the heat drives us out again. I lie still and wonder how we're going to get through the days. Sometimes I manage to sleep, if I lie on a wet sarong. I fan myself constantly, and read a detective story, set in Florida, in French. </p> <p>Lunch and dinner consist of lumps of meat in some kind of sauce, usually served with stony rice. There is always murky soup for starters. </p> <p>'Qu'est-ce que c'est?' James asks the waiter, every time. </p> <p>'C'est de la soupe,' he invariably replies. He varies this on the last day, when he states: 'C'est toujours de la soupe.' Still soup. </p> <p>We don't eat the meat. Sandrine becomes violently ill when she does. I chip my teeth on the gravel in the rice. </p> <p>No one's hungry, anyway. It's too hot. I find myself lying on the bunk, laughing at the absurdity of the situation, and simultaneously crying at its misery. </p> <p><strong>Friday</strong></p> <p>We wake up - or would have, had we slept - in Mopti, a trading town on the Niger. Delighted to escape, we charge down the gangplank. Groups of children trail us, shouting ' Toubab, \u00e7a va? '. Toubab is best translated as 'whitey', and we are assured that it's an affectionate term. ' Donne moi un cadeau, ' becomes a familiar refrain. We are glad to take some mild exercise, and to see the mud buildings of Mopti. </p> <p>'Shall we just leave the boat?' James suggests. 'Not go to Timbuktu?' </p> <p>It is powerfully tempting. We can't stand the idea of another night aboard, let alone the probable two (in the event, it's three). But can we really set off for Timbuktu, then give up halfway? Bogart and Hepburn would have had more mettle. </p> <p>The nominated departure time, 2pm, passes. We are on board. Several familiar people have joined us: an Israeli and Polish contingent we met on a train last week, and Dan, a British student whom James met in China. There's a lot of cargo on the bank which hasn't been loaded. There is no sign that anyone's thinking about loading it. We remain as indulgent as we can, desperately trying not to force our first-world expectations onto a doddery ferry service in Saharan Africa. The captain plucks a time out of the air to make us go away. We will leave at 6pm. </p> <p>Four hours after that, the lights of Mopti recede. We are pressing on, even though there is no guarantee of ever leaving Timbuktu (the roads are notoriously bad, and the planes often overbooked). I have to be in Bamako in 10 days to correct the proofs of my novel, which are arriving by Fedex. I try to suppress doubts about the extent of the publishers' sympathy if I tell them I'm stuck in Timbuktu. It's probably not on Fedex's route. </p> <p>I can feel the weight slipping off me, but would not recommend a diet of stony rice, stale bread and anti-malaria pills. James's cheeks hollow out. We fill the time by making guest lists for our wedding next year, and discussing the improbability of the existence of a world outside this boat. </p> <p><strong>Sunday</strong></p> <p>We should have arrived yesterday, and knowledgeable passengers predict we'll reach Kabara, the port for Timbuktu, tonight. A huge storm sweeps in from the desert and provides some glorious relief. I sleep for most of the night, as the rain cleans the decks and brings cool air into our horrible cabin. The passengers from the top deck shelter down below, where every inch of space is already crammed with people and cargo. </p> <p>We get stuck on a sandbank, and, sometime in the night, the boat is blown across to the opposite bank, where it becomes firmly entrenched. It tips sideways, and we plot our escape route for when it rolls over. This involves an alarming amount of underwater swimming. The bar has run out of all liquid apart from beer. The men get off and start a brave but futile pushing exercise. James joins in, and Dan follows, giving me his camera to record the occasion. The other westerners prefer to video events, impervious to the anger they are inciting. I descend, with most of the other women. </p> <p>A rope is attached to the bows, and while the women pull the rope, the men, waist deep in the river, push the boat. Hours later, we have no result, not least because the vessel has been firmly attached to the riverbed by a sturdy anchor throughout. The project is abandoned. James and I wander into the dunes, where clean animal bones poke out of the sand. We are at the limits of our endurance, and wonder whether we have actually died. A lethargic discussion ensues about whether this is Purgatory or Hell. For entertainment, I take a photograph of James's bare bottom with Dan's camera. We laugh about it, stupidly, for days. </p> <p><strong>Monday</strong></p> <p>Sometime in the afternoon, the rescue vessel rounds a bend in the river. When it pulls up alongside us, there is much climbing between the boats, and sharing of tea by old friends. We wait, giggling with cabin fever, until, hours later, it is deemed appropriate for the rescue to begin. Thick metal cables tie the boats together, and the new one accelerates away. One cable snaps and would have decap itated anyone in its path. The ferry inches away from the sandbank. The rescue boat suddenly charges back, to give us that final push. When it hurtles in our direction, we run with our neighbours into their cabin, which is the nearest. We are halfway in when the crash happens, but no one suffers serious injuries. A little girl bursts into tears. </p> <p>The boats chug to Kabara, and, shakily, we disembark. We team up with Annie and Jacques, a French couple who set an example of tolerance and good humour that we are unable to follow. A young man who calls himself Ali Baba George Washington ('not my given name,' he later confides) takes it upon himself to look after us. Although his prices are more reasonable than those of his rivals, who suggest that \u00a340 is an acceptable rate for the 16km car journey into town, Ali later tries to charge us \u00a3180 for an outing to see some hippos, and accidentally admits that he makes more than \u00a3175 every week. This is a fortune in Mali where the GDP per head is \u00a3550. </p> <p>Although Timbuktu turns out to be a miserable place, where the roads are ankle deep in sand as the Sahara encroaches further every year, it still represents freedom. We visit the old mud mosques, which don't have much going for them except their age. Tourism is a significant industry here, but the town's sole attraction lies in the mythology associated with its name. All traces of Timbuktu's golden age vanished hundreds of years ago; what remains is a quiet, poor town in the middle of nowhere. </p> <p>To our delight we are able to book ourselves on a plane back to Bamako the following day. Our cursory sightseeing leaves us overwhelmed by heat and hassle. Along with Annie and Jacques, we are the first at the airport. We climb aboard a propeller plane whose signs, ominously, are all in Russian. It is piloted by three Eastern European men who nattily team their gold-trimmed pilots' shirts with jeans. We don't like to contemplate what sort of pilots end up assigned to the Timbuktu run on Air Mali. We are, however, ecstatic to be leaving. </p> <p>After that expedition, I feel more entitled to call myself an experienced traveller, because I now know that travelling can be hell. Belatedly, I remember that Bogart and Hepburn's journey wasn't comfortable, either.</p> <p><strong>West African essentials</strong></p> <p>The cheapest way to get to West Africa is by charter flight to The Gambia. Contact the Gambia Experience (02380 730888) for prices from \u00a3286. Malian visas are available in Paris. Alternatively, land in Senegal and get a visa in Dakar for a modest \u00a37. Air France, Lufthansa and Sabena fly to Dakar. British citizens do not need a visa to visit Senegal. </p> <p>A grounding in French is essential to get around. West Africa is Francophone: only The Gambia speaks English.</p> <p>Dakar is a nightmare for the uninitiated. People come here from all over the region, whether they are Sierra Leonian refugees or just people from the countryside in need of work. The city teems with confidence tricksters.</p> <p>It's essential to take anti-malarial medication. Chloroquine-resistant malaria is reported all over West Africa. Yellow fever certificates are nominally an entry requirement for most countries (ours were never examined). Typhoid, polio and tetanus shots should be up to date, and a hepatitis A jab is a good idea.</p> <p>Rough Guide and Lonely Planet both publish West Africa guidebooks. We found the Bradt guide to Mali (\u00a313.95) to be better and more detailed than either.</p> <p>\u0095 Emily Barr's column 'Woman of the World' starts next week in Rio de Janeiro.</p>",

After that expedition, I feel more entitled to call myself an experienced traveller, because I now know that travelling can be hell. Belatedly, I remember that Bogart and Hepburn's journey wasn't comfortable, either. West African essentials The cheapest way to get to West Africa is by charter flight to The Gambia. Contact the Gambia Experience (02380 730888) for prices from \u00a3286. Malian visas are available in Paris. Alternatively, land in Senegal and get a visa in Dakar for a modest \u00a37. Air France, Lufthansa and Sabena fly to Dakar. British citizens do not need a visa to visit Senegal. A grounding in French is essential to get around. West Africa is Francophone: only The Gambia speaks English. Dakar is a nightmare for the uninitiated. People come here from all over the region, whether they are Sierra Leonian refugees or just people from the countryside in need of work. The city teems with confidence tricksters. It's essential to take anti-malarial medication. Chloroquine-resistant malaria is reported all over West Africa. Yellow fever certificates are nominally an entry requirement for most countries (ours were never examined). Typhoid, polio and tetanus shots should be up to date, and a hepatitis A jab is a good idea. Rough Guide and Lonely Planet both publish West Africa guidebooks. We found the Bradt guide to Mali (\u00a313.95) to be better and more detailed than either. \u0095 Emily Barr's column 'Woman of the World' starts next week in Rio de Janeiro.",

      "body": "<p><strong> 1 Thailand</strong><br> The winter is the best time to visit Thailand, where the monsoons fall during the summer months. The capital Bangkok is busy, polluted but exciting - a stark contrast to the powdery white beaches popularised by Leonardo Di Caprio. Austravel (0117 933 0450) combines the two into a 10-day trip staying at three-star hotels in the capital and island resort Phuket from \u00a3690. </p> <p> <strong> 2 Hawaii</strong><br> Mark Twain described Hawaii as 'the loveliest fleet of islands that lies anchored in any ocean'. Much concrete has been poured into the busier resorts but beaches are still magical and you can always find a quieter corner or island. For those who enjoy the buzz, the three-star Aston Waikiki Circle is across the road from the beach and if you depart between 4 January and 4 April, America Direct (0870 789 3334) offers five nights room-only from \u00a3631 per person. </p> <p> <strong> 3 Kenya</strong><br> Kenya has some wonderful Indian Ocean beaches, which can be enjoyed for their own sake or combined with inland safaris. January and February are the best months to visit, when the weather is hot and dry. March brings the 'long rains' and December is usually wet and cooler. Depart between 7 and 20 January with Hayes &amp; Jarvis (0870 89 89 890) to enjoy seven nights at the Shelley Beach Club for \u00a3748 per person. This is all-inclusive for five nights and full board for two, including return flights from Gatwick. </p> <p> <strong> 4 Barbados</strong><br> The most easterly of the Caribbean islands, Barbados is also the most British. Bajans are passionate about cricket, their national sport, and afternoon tea is a ritual at many hotels. The atmosphere is rarely stuffy, however. You are unlikely to get any change from \u00a31, 000 at the five-star hotels on the west coast, but the south coast offers good value and just as much fun. Seven nights room only at the Silver Sands hotel costs from \u00a3666 per person if you book through Cresta Worldwide (0870 161 0930). This price includes return flights from Heathrow. </p> <p> <strong> 5 Bali</strong><br> This Indonesian island is geographically dramatic with sacred caves, crater lakes and towering active volcanoes, tropical rainforests and miles of sandy beaches. There is also a rich cultural heritage evi dent in more than 20,000 palaces and temples and many colourful ceremonies and festivals. Asia World (0870 990 8098) offers five-nights room-only at the Puri Santrian Hotel in the south-west of the island for \u00a3679 per person, including return scheduled flights from Heathrow. The hotel has lush gardens leading onto the beach and is close to a small complex of shops and restaurants. </p> <p> <strong> 6 Malaysia</strong><br> Pulau Lankawi is a collection of 104 islands off the west coast near the Thai border. The main island is shrouded in legend, lending the sights a mystical aura. Makam Mahsuri is the main pilgrimage spot while Telaga Tujuh (Seven Wells) cascades 90 metres down a rock face, which rises out of a forest and offers spectacular views. The Holiday Inn Lankawi lies on a quiet stretch of beach and has a large pool, ideal for basking. AsiaWorld (0870 990 8098) offers a five-night room-only stay at this three-star hotel from \u00a3622 per person, including return flights from Heathrow. </p> <p> <strong> 7 Madeira</strong><br> Despite its lack of beaches, the 'floating garden' is a beautiful winter holiday destination. The towering cliffs and plunging waterfalls are as dramatic as the sheltered fishing harbours are scenic. Sovereign (0990 768373) offers seven nights B&amp;B at the newly refurbished Hotel Jardins Do Lago in Funchal. This eighteenth-century quinta has a pool, gym, sauna and Turkish bath. Prices are from \u00a3669 per person. For golfers, a seven-night B&amp;B stay in the Casa Velha Do Palheiro costs from \u00a3625 per person. This converted country house is next to the championship Palheiro golf course and guests receive 30 per cent off green fees. Both holidays include return flights but you must depart between 3 January and 6 February. </p> <p> <strong> 8 Mexico</strong><br> The purpose-built resort of Cancun is an L-shaped island off the Yucatan Peninsula, joined to the mainland at each end by a bridge. Despite its US influence, the feel of the resort is utterly Mexican, especially nearer downtown Cancun where many of the locals live. Mayan ruins lie in the surrounding jungle and you must take a trip to the breathtaking temple at Chichen Itza and the ancient walled city of Tulum. Depart between January and March with Tropical Journeys (0870 709 3060) and you can spend 10 nights all-inclusive in the Punta Sun hotel for \u00a3699 per person. Price includes return British Airways flights from Gatwick. </p> <p> <strong> 9 Tunisia</strong><br> Although bargain-basement holidays are available to Tunisia, it is worth considering a more interesting alternative. The island of Jerba is said to have hosted Ulysses during his mythical Odyssey - he was probably tempted by the lush gardens and long, sandy beaches. The pace of life is slow, except during the weekly souk, where locally made terracotta and brassware are bartered for. A seven-night stay in the luxurious Dar Dhiafa hotel from Tunisian specialists Wigmore Holidays (020 7836 4999) costs \u00a3599 if you depart between 7 and 24 December. The price drops to \u00a3499 for departures between 1 January and 14 February. Prices include breakfast and return flights. </p> <p> <strong> 10 The Gambia</strong><br> Despite being only 22 miles wide and having a similar population to Berkshire, this tiny African republic is a popular winter sun destination: the simple reason is guaranteed sunshine. The coastline follows the River Gambia 240 miles inland, and boat trips are a popular alternative to sunbathing; monkeys and exotic birds can be seen in the forest either side of the river. The Gambia Experience (023 8073 0888) offers a range of properties, including a former colonial mansion, the Ngala Lodge. This Deluxe Grade property has only 10 suites. Seven nights B&amp;B costs \u00a3579 per person for departures on 2 February.</p>",

In certain well-heeled circles, Kensington and Chelsea Conservative Association's annual winter ball is still a hot ticket, and their MP of only a year's standing could certainly draw a crowd. </p> <p> But as the Shadow Chancellor circled the room making small talk last Tuesday night, he had no idea his guests would be reading of his apparently imminent political demise over their breakfast tables the next morning. It was a bizarre twist in the increasingly fraught plot unfolding around the Tory party as it stumbles from crisis to crisis. The climax already appears to be clear: a long period more in opposition. </p> <p> After three years with William Hague at the helm, the party still languishes more or less where it started in the opinion polls, and the chatter in Westminster tearooms has again been of leadership challenges after an election Tory MPs expect to lose.</p> <p> Old wounds over Europe are gaping again too. But what really tipped the party over the edge this time was the decision, with the patient already critical, to indulge in a little more bloodletting. Thus the Daily Telegraph unusually devoted its entire front page on Wednesday to a single story: the breathless announcement that Portillo had lost the stomach for politics and was considering giving up. Far from challenging Hague for the crown, it suggested, he might just limp off into the sunset. </p> <p> Portillo, who had been approached with what he thought were routine questions about his ambitions, was quoted as protesting that he did not want to be leader, though he was not leaving either. But such is the power the rightwing press now wields over the Tories that the damage was already done. The Daily Mail gleefully pondered the state of his marriage, TV pundits the state of his mind. He even suffered the indignity of his old foe Ann Widdecombe rallying generously to his defence. </p> <p> But has Portillo really had a dark night of the soul, or was it, as his allies muttered, more a night of the long knives, with friends of Hague finally striking at the leader's rival? And had Portillo's calls for tolerance on sexuality and race made him easy pickings? </p> <p> \"For once I think Michael has been more sinned against than sinning - or more spun against than spinning,\" said one Tory front bench source. </p> <p> \"Suppose he did decide to stand down - six months before an election - would the party really be strengthened? The Praetorian Guard around William are working not for the party but for the leader. They are not thinking of the good of the party.\" </p> <p> Central Office, of course, flatly denies involvement. But impeccably-placed voices have been whispering to right-wing commentators for weeks that Portillo was restless and unhappy. Then they struck gold with the Telegraph. And as Shadow Cabinet members point out, for the Hague camp even to be suspected of being behind the attacks is a worrying sign. </p> <p> Portillo, like many of his colleagues, has not much enjoyed opposition. Shadow Ministers say he misses the retinue of civil servants he commanded in government, and after basking in press attention during his parliamentary exile does not like his initiatives as Shadow Chancellor going relatively unnoticed. \"He isn't used to negative press and he doesn't like it,\" says one. </p> <p> His reincarnation as a cheerleader for compassion has alienated the Sun and the Mail , which turned squeamish when he admitted past gay experiences: the Telegraph's editor Charles Moore, official biographer of Margaret Thatcher, was apparently struck by her dismissal of her former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 as \"confused\". </p> <p> Nor have the enemies he made in government forgotten. MPs tell the tale of how Portillo once strode into a Commons dining room to find the only Tory table occupied by John Major and a handful of intimates. Snubbed by those who once regarded him as a \"bastard\" over Europe, Portillo was apparently reduced to sitting on his own until a bunch of pitying New Labour women asked him to join them. </p> <p> But friends insist he is tough enough to take it. \"Some of his old supporters might be confused, but he isn't confused about himself,\" said one. \"He is bigger than a little bit of sniping, and well-schooled enough to know it would come.\" </p> <p> And the Tories might well have weathered one storm last week, if another shiver had not run down their spines. Again, the cause was an attempt at political assassination. </p> <p> Tomorrow night, the MP Ian Taylor faces an attempt to deselect him purely because of his pro-European views. If successful, it will be the first time in nearly 50 years a Tory MP has been dumped on political grounds alone. </p> <p> The vote in Taylor's rock-solid Surrey seat of Esher and Walton was triggered by a 70-year-old local activist, Pamela Normington, who raised a petition urging he be ousted for \"repeated rejection of Conservative party policy on Europe\" and membership of the cross-party pressure group Britain in Europe. She has said she regards his views as \"heresy\". </p> <p> Theoretically, only an earthquake should shift an MP such as Taylor, who has represented part of the Surrey gin-and-Jag belt, for 13 years. Married to the daughter of a Tory peer, he was a Science Minister under John Major. </p> <p> He has spoken up for tolerance, warning against the \"politics of the cheap thrill\". Even his detractors say he is a decent, conscientious man. </p> <p> But there are nearly 3,000 members of the ferociously Eurosceptic Democracy Movement in the Esher area, many of them party members. If they pack the meeting, Taylor could just lose, leaving him dependent on a postal ballot of the entire localmembership to save him. </p> <p> Backbenchers fear a witch-hunt of outspoken pro-Europeans, such as former Ministers Ken Clarke and David Curry, could follow. \"If Ian went down, I am sure they will look for someone else next,\" said one senior backbencher. </p> <p> \"This is an issue that affects every single MP in the Conservative party today, not just pro-Europeans. If this goes ahead, are we then going to deselect Ann Widdecombe because she is opposed to hunting? Are they going to deselect people because they have voted to lower the age of consent for homosexuals to 16?\" </p> <p> Central Office firmly expects Taylor to survive, but he will become a renewed target at the general election. The Democracy Movement is sharpening its claws for an attempt to prevent moderate MPs getting back into parliament. </p> <p> From February it will begin targeting MPs, particularly in marginal seats, who support ratification of the next EU treaty on enlargement. Their constituents will be bombarded with posters and letters warning that the candidate would betray them to Brussels. </p> <p> \"We will be putting out stuff in their constituency, saying if you don't want these powers to be transferred to Brussels then don't re-elect John Gummer, or whoever - give your support to a candidate committed to having a referendum on the Nice treaty,\" said a spokesman. </p> <p> Eurosceptics used similar tactics to devastating effect in 1997, driving a wedge between the two Tory camps and creating a climate of fear. It is the last thing Hague needs in 2001. </p> <p> The difference between the Esher coup attempt and the demolition job on Portillo, however, is that the former may prove an unexpectedly healing experience. Arch-eurosceptics such as Iain Duncan-Smith, Francis Maude and Angela Browning have all written letters supporting Taylor, despite disagreeing with his views. \"They make it clear the party cannot deselect on the grounds of political views because it would be a lesser party,\" Taylor told the Observer . </p> <p> No doubt they also know that Eurosceptics too could become targets if such a precedent were set. Oddly, the attack on Taylor may have united Tory MPs seeking their own survival. </p> <p> \"I genuinely think this has been a salutary experience,\" said one senior MP. </p> <p> \"People have stared over a new abyss and thought, 'Do we want to be like Labour in the Eighties? - No'. As long as Ian wins, it will all go away. But if he loses, it is really, really serious.\" </p> <p> But those same survival instincts are now telling Tory MPs that, based on the current poll ratings, they are not going into government for a long time. Their careers - and even their seats - are at stake. Which means the struggle for the leadership will not go away. </p> <p> Some Shadow Ministers insist the conspiracy theorists got carried away last week, and that the Portillo and Hague camps have both learnt their lessons from the bitter Major era. </p> <p> \"Charles Moore has been hostile to Michael ever since Michael revealed he was gay, unfortunately,\" said one Shadow Cabinet source. \"But I don't actually believe either Michael or William want to play that game.\" </p> <p> Others point out that Portillo himself is hardly an innocent abroad. Several opponents blame him for encouraging unattributed briefings against them. But both sides know that any talk of rifts, whoever inspires them, is harmful. </p> <p> \"There has been a lot of talk of briefing against Michael for a long time now. Even the fact that it is believed to be happening is very grave,\"' said one source. \"We need to get a grip.\" </p> <p> Significantly, that warning was echoed last week by the 1922 committee, the Tories' men in grey suits empowered to offer leaders a pearl-handled revolver, if necessary, for the good of the party. </p> <p> When the little-known international development spokesman, Gary Streeter, a devout Christian and a somewhat unworldly politician, volunteered in a TV interview to be shown today that the Tories would probably lose next May, he was only saying publicly what most think in private. </p> <p> Meanwhile the Portillo-Hague pantomime plays on to packed houses: this Tuesday the two men will jointly launch an initiative on economic policy. The date was arranged before the current row erupted, but will still be interpreted as a new attempt to bury the hatchet </p> <p> At the Centre for Policy Studies on the same night leading Tory thinkers, including the Shadow Social Security Secretary David Willetts, and Portillo's biographer Michael Gove, will debate the inflammatory question of 'mods versus rockers': social liberals such as Portillo against traditional right-wingers like Widdecombe. Willetts is expected to stick safely to arguing for a 'third way' between the two, which is just what most Tory voters probably want. </p> <p> Two months ago, it looked as though William Hague could provide them with this. But if the Tories do receive a drubbing at the ballot box, restless party members may start to look elsewhere. </p>",

      "body": "<p>Seven years ago, when I had just returned from a year working in Santiago, I sent a guidebook publisher a proposal for a book about Chile. Memories of Pinochet were receding, and more and more gringos were making their way to the country. I was thrilled when the publisher was receptive to the idea: I was only 19, and the prospect of spending months travelling in Chile was wildly exciting. </p> <p>However, as three years went by and my proposal gathered dust on the 'pending' shelf, I began to look at the prospect differently. Twice I was within weeks of heading out on a research trip, but each time a co-author pulled out. I was losing the romantic attitude which I'd first had towards the project. Travelling around Chile might be great, but discovering that the coffee tasted like dishwater in the Bar Pablo Neruda while running up an overdraft was less appealing. I had always used guidebooks when I had been travelling, but now I realised how much sacrifice and hard work goes into putting such a book together. </p> <p>In the event, I set off on a journey across South America that was to lead to a narrative travel book. I took with me Footprint's doorstep-sized South American Handbook . This legendary guide is as useful in telling you where to wash your socks in Punta del Este as it is in planning an expedition into the Amazon. It found me the cheapest hotels in Rio, Montevideo and Buenos Aires, but I soon discovered that even this incredibly useful book was not much help when I was stuck in the pampas with only two horses for company. </p> <p>There are not many tourists in the middle of Argentina or Uruguay, so there is not much call for even the most detailed guidebook to include places like Laprida or Casup\u00e1. But I found it reassuring that there were still thousands of places where there was no substitute for human interaction. I soon found that simple questions - 'Who takes in lodgers around here?' - would elicit answers that my guidebook did not. </p> <p>As I struck further into the wilds, I found that I barely consulted my 'travelling companion' any more. Perhaps I became blas\u00e9. I was in for a shock. I was bitten by a dog and, thanks to the fastidious detail of the South American Handbook , I was soon in touch with the best doctor in Guayaquil and arranging rabies jabs. </p> <p>Although guidebooks are necessarily fact-based, there can be a surprising difference in styles. I was struck by how much variation there is when I went to west Africa earlier this year to research my next book, taking the Rough Guide to West Africa with me. You don't find much choice of retaurants or hotels in west Africa, so the Rough Guide writers provide evocative anecdotes of their own travels and delve into the region's ethnic and political history. This makes the book informative, erudite, useful and insightful. </p> <p>I spent four months in west Africa, and found the Rough Guide strangely compelling. I was travelling in the bush and living with a Senegalese friend, and so endless listings would not have been very useful to me (although the guide has these as well). What I found invaluable was the book's serious engagement with the region's complex ethnic and historical background. </p> <p>As I sweltered beneath mango trees, I found myself reading about distant regions in Niger or Cameroon which I was never likely to go to. It is surely impossible for a guidebook to get every fact right or to include every destination.

      "bodyText": "Seven years ago, when I had just returned from a year working in Santiago, I sent a guidebook publisher a proposal for a book about Chile. Memories of Pinochet were receding, and more and more gringos were making their way to the country. I was thrilled when the publisher was receptive to the idea: I was only 19, and the prospect of spending months travelling in Chile was wildly exciting. However, as three years went by and my proposal gathered dust on the 'pending' shelf, I began to look at the prospect differently. Twice I was within weeks of heading out on a research trip, but each time a co-author pulled out. I was losing the romantic attitude which I'd first had towards the project. Travelling around Chile might be great, but discovering that the coffee tasted like dishwater in the Bar Pablo Neruda while running up an overdraft was less appealing. I had always used guidebooks when I had been travelling, but now I realised how much sacrifice and hard work goes into putting such a book together. In the event, I set off on a journey across South America that was to lead to a narrative travel book. I took with me Footprint's doorstep-sized South American Handbook . This legendary guide is as useful in telling you where to wash your socks in Punta del Este as it is in planning an expedition into the Amazon. It found me the cheapest hotels in Rio, Montevideo and Buenos Aires, but I soon discovered that even this incredibly useful book was not much help when I was stuck in the pampas with only two horses for company. There are not many tourists in the middle of Argentina or Uruguay, so there is not much call for even the most detailed guidebook to include places like Laprida or Casup\u00e1. But I found it reassuring that there were still thousands of places where there was no substitute for human interaction. I soon found that simple questions - 'Who takes in lodgers around here?' - would elicit answers that my guidebook did not. As I struck further into the wilds, I found that I barely consulted my 'travelling companion' any more. Perhaps I became blas\u00e9. I was in for a shock. I was bitten by a dog and, thanks to the fastidious detail of the South American Handbook , I was soon in touch with the best doctor in Guayaquil and arranging rabies jabs. Although guidebooks are necessarily fact-based, there can be a surprising difference in styles. I was struck by how much variation there is when I went to west Africa earlier this year to research my next book, taking the Rough Guide to West Africa with me. You don't find much choice of retaurants or hotels in west Africa, so the Rough Guide writers provide evocative anecdotes of their own travels and delve into the region's ethnic and political history. This makes the book informative, erudite, useful and insightful. I spent four months in west Africa, and found the Rough Guide strangely compelling. I was travelling in the bush and living with a Senegalese friend, and so endless listings would not have been very useful to me (although the guide has these as well). What I found invaluable was the book's serious engagement with the region's complex ethnic and historical background. As I sweltered beneath mango trees, I found myself reading about distant regions in Niger or Cameroon which I was never likely to go to. It is surely impossible for a guidebook to get every fact right or to include every destination. I wondered whether one of the marks of a good guidebook was not comparable to a narrative book: if they don't inspire curiosity, something must be missing. How to enter the Guidebook of the Year The Observer today launches the search for the 2000 Guidebook of the Year in association with Travelex and Books Etc. The winner will be chosen by a panel of judges, chaired by Observer travel editor Desmond Balmer. He will be joined by Jackie Crank, manager of the Broadgate branch of Books etc; Bing Taylor, managing director of Orion Press and founding chairman of the Word, the London Festival of Literature; and Gerry Conroy, Travelex group director of operations. They will be looking for the book that best provides practical information for readers travelling in unfamiliar territory and does so with style and flair. The criteria includes: 1 Structure: is the book easy to use? 2 Illustration: are the pictures and maps clear and relevant? 3 Practicals: are the listings comprehensive? 4 Background: is the history and society well explained? 5 Culture: are the heritage and the everyday way of life presented? 6 Writing: is the text lively, informed and innovative? 7 Responsibility: is the visitor encouraged to make a positive contribution? 8 Production: do the values reflect the price and the target market?

Large resorts such as Torremolinos and Fuengirola supply the hustle and bustle but the palaces of Granada are just a few miles inland, and Seville is also within easy reach. The cheapest holidays tend to be in the larger resorts with nightlife and facilities appealing to clubbers and families alike. Alternatively, JMC (020 8218 3300) is offering 14 nights self-catering at the Apartments Capistrano Playa in the quieter town of Nerja from \u00a3209 per person, based on four adults sharing an apartment. </p> <p> <strong> 2 Cyprus</strong><br> This Mediterranean island receives more sun than mainland Europe during the winter but the trade-off is a little extra rain. Consequently prices tend to be low, especially in the larger resorts, which can be used as a base from which to explore the country's lush green mountains and historical sites. Seven nights self-catering at the New York Plaza Apartments in Paphos is available for \u00a3169 from Libra Holidays (020 8275 5500), including return flights from Gatwick if you depart between 29 January and 4 February. </p> <p> <strong> 3 Benidorm</strong><br> A firm favourite with the British, the Costa Blanca has its share of winter sunshine. The home-from-home British-style restaurants and pubs may not be everyone's cup of tea but there are plenty of bodegas around serving paella and rioja, especially in the pretty old town. Accommodation is almost entirely in concrete towers but prices are rock-bottom out of season and the two crescent beaches are meticulously maintained. If you depart between 5 and 26 January, First Choice (0870 7500 001) will put you up in the Hotel Trinisol III Apartments for seven nights from \u00a3159 per person on a self-catering basis. </p> <p> <strong> 4 Tunisia</strong><br> Temperatures in North Africa are more bearable at this time of year than the relentless desert blaze of the summer. Tunisia has wonderful landscapes and a rich history to discover and the French influence on its cuisine and hotels hasn't taken away the African feel. Prices for hotels out of season are cheap, probably due to some winter rainfall. Seven nights half-board in the five-star Hotel Hannibal Palace in Port el Kantaoui costs \u00a3219 per person from Portland Direct (08702 413159), if you depart between 13 and 17 December. </p> <p> <strong> 5 Gran Canaria</strong><br> The Canary Islands are popular with families thanks to relaxed resorts and a range of activities. Gran Canaria offers horse riding, water parks and funfairs and family friendly accommodation some with kids' clubs. Cala Nova Apartments start from \u00a3155 per person, based on four sharing a one-bedroom apartment. Bookable through Portland Direct (08702 413159), facilities include the Splash! club, which is suitable for three to 12-year-olds. </p> <p> <strong> 6 Tenerife</strong><br> For nightlife on a budget, Playa De La America is unbeatable. The place was built for giving it large in the clubs and bars and then nursing the resulting hangover on the beach the next day. Attractions include a water park and go-karting, and the waterfront boasts an array of funky shops and caf\u00e9s. Cosmos (0870 908 4299) has seven-nights self-catering at the Parque De La Paz Apartments starting at \u00a3249, based on six adults sharing a two-bedroom apartment. </p> <p> <strong> 7 Lanzarote</strong><br> The hottest and driest of the Canary Islands is also the most spectacular. The dormant volcanoes and lava fields at the Timanfaya National Park have an almost lunar feel to them and the former fishing village of Playa Blanca has a ferry service to Fuerteventura and Corralejo. Thomson (08702 413156) is offering seven nights self-catering in the Galeon Playa Apartments for \u00a3215 per person based on four adults sharing a one-bedroom apartment. Small people are welcome too - 'Superfamily' facilities are available including Mothercare equipment, baby packs and a kid's club for three to 12-year-olds with a daily activities programme. </p> <p> <strong> 8 Malta</strong><br> For culture on a budget, Malta is hard to beat. The island boasts a rich history - some remains date back to 4000BC when the first settlers arrived. Prehistoric temples, Roman sites and Christian catacombs are all within reach if you hire a car. You may not need a bucket and spade - there are few beaches - but your hotel will almost certainly have a pool to sunbathe by. The three-star Plaza Hotel in Silema costs from \u00a3229 per person for seven nights from Bellair Holidays (020 8785 3266). This price includes return flights from Heathrow and is on a B&amp;B basis. Seven nights self-catering at the Medallion Court Apartments in St Paul's Bay is also available from Bellair for \u00a3192 per person. </p> <p> <strong> 9 Cote d'Azur</strong><br> A weekend break in Nice makes a perfect escape from the pressures of Christmas.

There is little in the way of sightseeing but when the sand is this soft, who cares? The more active have an impressive selection of watersports at their disposal but this is in away-from-it-all place with the emphasis firmly on lounging.

Posh Spice and many of her jet-set cronies have decided that beige checks are this year's fashion statement, helping to transform the fortunes of GUS's Burberry division. </p> <p>And what a transformation. In the year to March 1999, the upmarket mac-maker produced just \u00a310.7 million of profit on \u00a3207m of sales, and that included a contribution from Scotch House. In the six months to September alone, its sales were \u00a3185m, producing a \u00a326.6m profit. </p> <p>GUS promises more to come. The flagship store in London's Regent Street has just opened, the New York outlet is doubling in size and a Tokyo branch will open next month but fashion centres such as Los Angeles and Barcelona are still untapped. It is also trying to extend the reach of the brand: shortly everything from babies to beds could be adorned with the Burberry label. </p> <p>Analysts who 12 months ago were saying that GUS would be lucky to raise \u00a3300m for Burberry, are now pencilling in valuations of up to \u00a32 billion. </p> <p>As expected, GUS last week confirmed that it plans to cash in that value. Instead of an outright sale, as some had speculated, it plans to float about a quarter of the shares within 18 months. The aim, says GUS chief executive John Peace, is to ensure that shareholders get their share of the growth Burberry is expected to generate. </p> <p>Burberry may have attracted the attention last week but it accounts for just 7 per cent of GUS's sales (although more than 12 per cent of its profits). The real challenge for Peace and his team is to turn round the rest of the business. Here there were some signs that it is succeeding, albeit slowly. </p> <p>Experian, which seemed to turn from great white hope to great white elephant almost overnight, does seem to be back on track. A new chief executive has got profits in the US moving ahead again while it continues to win new customers. </p> <p>Argos is proving to be a decent enough acquisition. Simple expedients, like offering shoppers in each store the same catalogue, helped to push like-for-like sales up by 11 per cent and profits up by 12.6 per cent. Traditional home shopping, which still accounts for more than a quarter of sales, remains a running sore. Peace puts a brave face on the 5 per cent decline in sales over the first half, saying it was planned following the decision to 'right-size' the business by cutting the recruitment of unprofitable customers. Planned or not, it still produced a 15 per cent profit. </p> <p>About the best that can be said for GUS's home-shopping operation is that the profit contribution has fallen so low - it accounted for less than 4 per cent of the total in the first half of the year - that further falls will have little impact on the group. If Peace and his team do manage to reverse the decline, however, the upside from this area could be substantial. </p> <p>That is a mammoth task. Peace has great hopes for its Additions catalogue, which has the range of its traditional catalogue but is picked up in an Argos store. More crucially, because it does not include the 'free' credit, and agency commission of the traditional mail-order business, prices are around 20 per cent lower. </p> <p>But Additions is only just being rolled out nationally. It is testing a cut-price home-shopping catalogue with Kay's customers, stripping out the credit and commission offer, but it is too early to judge the results. </p> <p>Excitement over Burberry has sent GUS's shares soaring in recent weeks and they now stand on about 16 times its expected profits for the full year, a slight discount to the market. </p> <p>That still leaves a bit of upside for the long-term investor. Buy. </p> <p><strong> Messy Marconi</strong><br> </p> <p> Marconi is learning the hard way that what goes up must come down, It was one of the best performers in the FTSE 100 in 1999 as investors warmed to its transformation from monolithic defence giant General Electric Company to a nimble communications specialist. </p> <p>In the last three months, however, the City's attitude to communications has shifted from enthusiasm at its growth prospects to concern about soaring debt levels and worry that these growth projections are over-optimistic. </p> <p>The result is that Marconi's shares have almost halved from their peak of 1260p, touched in August. Last week's interim announcement showing a 19 per cent rise in sales and a 26 per cent increase in operating profits, even excluding the benefit of acquisitions, failed to steady nerves and the shares slipped further. </p> <p>There are clearly reasons to be nervous about Marconi. Its communications business accounted for two-thirds of sales and almost three-quarters of profits in the six months to 30 September. The order book - \u00a33.3 billion confirmed and a further \u00a32.7bn of what it calls 'frame contracts' - appears healthy enough to guarantee a few more years of impressive growth. </p> <p>Investors, however, are worried that these orders will never materialise into sales - the customers will find their own orders dry up or, as seriously, they will run out of cash to pay for them - so are unwilling to rate that forward business as highly as they did. </p> <p>Marconi points out that 90 per cent of its business is with sector giants such as BT, Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom. But anyone looking at the plunge in BT's credit rating would not find that too reassuring. </p> <p>The group also points to its systems business, which it has decided to retain, as a potential buffer against swings in communications demand. But this division accounts for just a fifth of turnover and grew by just 8 per cent, excluding acquisitions. That is not bad, but it is not good enough to justify a premium rating. Even after the falls, Marconi's shares stand on more than 33 times forecast earnings. </p> <p>If demand for its communications systems and services continue at their current rate, that would be justified. And Marconi's business is certainly a lot more sustainable than some of the flakier technology businesses around. But until the pattern of future demand is clearer, the shares are likely to remain volatile. Only long-term investors with a strong stomach should consider the shares.</p>",

      "trailText": "<p><strong> Keith Richards</strong>  </p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong> Keith Richards</strong> </p> <p> I was downtown on Fifth Avenue in New York. The first bit of news I got, I thought: 'He'll make it. It's just a flesh wound.' And then, later on, the news really came. He wasn't just a mate of mine, he was a mate of everybody's, really. He was a funny guy. And you realise that you're stunned. You really don't believe it. And you think, 'God, why can't I do anything about it?' I got well drunk on it. And I had another one for John. Then there was the confusion, the phone calls, trying to find out if Yoko was OK. </p> <p>There were the Beatles, and there was John. As a band, they were a great unit. But John, he was his own man. We got along very well. We didn't see each other very often, but he would sort of turn up at your hotel. Usually, if I was in the city, I'd stay at the Plaza. If John turned up, that meant he wanted to party. He didn't come there to discuss, you know, philosophy, although it would end up like that. I would just get into town, and there'd be a knock at the door: 'Hey, mon, what is going on around here?' We would get the guitars down and sing. And, in our spare time, discuss world domination. </p> <p>He's rubbed off on me as much as anybody. A bit of me rubbed off on John, too, you know. He took it with him. My father just passed away, and he winked at me just before he died. I really feel a lot better about death now. I'm getting off on that wink. I'd give the wink to John. </p> <p> <strong> Marianne Faithfull</strong> </p> <p> I had just gotten into a minicab in London when the news came on, and then they played all John Lennon songs. The first was 'A Day in the Life'. I was completely shocked but, in a way, not that surprised. </p> <p>The most amazing time I ever had with John is when we went to see the maharishi, and that's when I really got closest to him. He was so funny. I was always a bit frightened of him because he was so incredibly clever. The weekend we went to Bangor where the maharishi was delivering a lecture was very intense because we all went on the train there: the Beatles and me and Mick Jagger and the maharishi. Then, over the weekend, we got the news that Brian Epstein had overdosed. John was devastated. I wish I'd gone on the retreat in India - not because I liked the maharishi, because I didn't. Just to be there to hear Lennon's asides and to watch the whole thing unravel - because it did. I would have loved to be there for that. </p> <p> <strong> Noel Gallagher</strong> </p> <p> I was in my front-room in Manchester listening to a football match, and they interrupted it to say that John Lennon had been assassinated. It was like, 'Fuck'; it was just silence, really. Especially for my mum; she was a teenager in the Sixties and into the Beatles. Lennon dying had a more profound effect on her than on me, because at the time I was 13. </p> <p>I didn't know what it meant until I dissected 'the White Album'. And then I thought: 'Fuck, this guy is not even around any more.' Lennon's legacy is absolutely 100 per cent his music. I'm not really interested in his politics or his bandwagon-jumping towards the end of his life. </p> <p>His music is just completely timeless and unsurpassable. If it wasn't for John Lennon, I think that Paul McCartney would have had the Beatles writing 'Yesterday' right up until the day that they split up. </p> <p>Ask any cutting-edge musicians in London, like the Chemical Brothers or Prodigy, if you trace all that music backwards, it all stops at 'Tomorrow Never Knows'. It was 1966 when Lennon wrote that song. All the other songs that were around, it was still all, 'You love me/ I love you/ Whoopie-doo'. Lennon wanted to sound like a thousand monks chanting on top of a hill. He's probably still 20 years ahead of his time. </p> <p> <strong> Sting</strong> </p> <p> I think the Police had just come offstage in Miami. I was told that he'd been shot, and I had the reaction that everybody had - disbelief, shock, horror. What happens when people like him die is that the landscape changes. You know, a mountain disappears, a river is gone. And I think his death was probably as significant as that. The Beatles were formative in my upbringing, my education. They came from a very similar background - the industrial towns in England, working class; they wrote their own songs, conquered the world. That was the blueprint for lots of other British kids to try to do the same. We all miss him, and I think about him every time I walk by that building. </p> <p> <strong> Michael Douglas</strong> </p> <p> I have a newborn son, so I've been listening a lot to 'Beautiful Boy'. John wrote it for Sean, and it's a lovely song to a child. It's been bringing back all of those times for me, in the Sixties and Seventies, when the Beatles and Lennon meant so much. And with the election, I'm reminded of how politics today could really use John Lennon - his truthfulness. He's needed. </p> <p> <strong> Ronnie Spector</strong> </p> <p> I first met him in London in 1963. The Ronettes were the top group in England at the time. He saw us and got in touch with our manager, and there was this party and we danced all night with all the fellas, taught them the New York dances. He liked me for more than just my voice. As the party wound down, we started talking. I was just 19 years old, and starting to make it big, and he knew things. He told me: 'It's all going to change, you're going to start riding in limousines.' I'm, like, 'You're kidding me!' </p> <p>I met him in the street years later. He called my name: 'Ronnie!' and I turned around; it was so fucking cool. When he called my name, everyone turned around and saw him (and recognised him), and he didn't care. He got shot right after that. </p> <p>When he was shot, I was so devastated, I stayed in bed for a week. I was in the studio when I heard; I just dropped the phone - it broke my heart. I always think of John Lennon every time I'm in the recording studio. I can't help it. He's my spirit talking to me, saying: 'Don't give up.' </p> <p> <strong> Lenny Kravitz</strong> </p> <p> I met Yoko Ono and Sean on my first tour. For my birthday one year, Yoko gave me one of John's shirts. It's black, one of those disco rollerskating shirts; he used to wear those tight, glittery shirts. </p> <p>Today, I think John would be doing some cutting-edge hardcore music. His first solo record is one of the most hardcore pieces of music ever recorded. And at the end of 'Mother', when he's saying, 'Mama, don't go, Daddy, come home', his soul is just spilling out; it's so hardcore. </p> <p> <strong> Sinead O'Connor</strong> </p> <p> It was my twelfth birthday and I was walking home from school. I guess I would have been young enough to not see death as being entirely disastrous. The nature of my own personality is that I don't see death as a disastrous thing. It's just a door that opens, and somebody goes somewhere else. </p> <p>Lennon had a sense of everybody's right to stir shit. He was very brave and vulnerable, and saw that it was brave to show one's vulnerability. </p> <p>He would probably love the rap movement. In a lot of ways, rap is where his voice can still be heard. People underestimate the subliminal impact of not just his music but the things he was doing publicly, like the shit-stirring. All of that had a huge influence on rap, and on little, bold, big-mouthed Irish singers. You almost forget how sexy he was. Plus, he was wonderful and gorgeous. </p> <p> <strong> Sheryl Crow</strong> </p> <p> I was watching Monday night football at the University of Missouri and Howard Cosell announced Lennon's death. He basically denounced the importance of the game and proclaimed that one of this generation's icons had been killed. </p> <p>In the band that most influenced music and, moreover, culture, he represented the rock'n'roll attitude of rebellion, dissatisfaction and social consciousness, the idea that we as people can expand our minds, grow, live together and love in peace. He tried to incorporate those ideals in his music and his life. His influence is everywhere - in every rock'n'roll singer-songwriter. </p> <p> <strong> Tom Petty</strong> </p> <p> I was in Cherokee Recording Studios in Hollywood when I heard. I was working with producer Jimmy Lovine, who knew John and had worked with him quite a bit. Someone called the studio from New York and said that John had been shot. We thought it was a gag and we kept working. Then someone called and said: 'John's dead.' It just stopped the session. I went home and on the way I could see people sitting in their cars at traffic lights just crying. It was a hard thing to believe. I still have trouble believing it. </p> <p>John Lennon meant everything. His influence was immeasurable when I started to play in the mid-Sixties. He was probably one of the two or three great rock singers ever, and what can you really say about his songwriting? He was just... transcendental. And his rhythm-guitar playing - I really studied it quite a bit. If you ever want to see some great rhythm guitar, check out in A Hard Day's Night when they do 'And I Love Her'. He could really make a band just kind of surge and jump. </p> <p>To me, Lennon's legacy is honesty. When I was young and seeing the Beatles performing on TV, they were the first ones who weren't just saying pat, showbiz banter. They'd actually say something. He was a great role model for my whole generation, because you knew when John suffered and you knew when John was happy, but it all somehow came out OK. </p> <p><strong> Shirley Manson</strong> </p> <p> I was 14, and I was in my first class of the day and some girls in the class who knew I was a freak about the Beatles started teasing me, saying: 'Oh, you know John Lennon, he's dead.' Then our teacher told us the news, and there were other girls in that class who loved the Beatles like I did, and we all cried and cried. Nobody has been able to encompass his humanity, his humility and his humour, his wit and his intelligence quite the same way he has done - like the perfect rock star. </p> <p>The best dream I ever had was that I was sitting next to him in an airplane. I was his wife, but I was me. Nothing happened in the dream except that I could hear the drone of the airplane. And I said nothing, but I could feel the connection between us. When I woke up in the morning, I don't think I've ever felt so deeply contented. </p> <p> <strong> John Travolta</strong> </p> <p> I blocked out where I was when I heard - I kind of just travelled in my mind to where it happened. I was so familiar with that spot, because I had lived in the building next door. There was a building that Carly Simon and James Taylor, the Beatles and Mick Jagger had lived in at various times, and it was right around the block. </p> <p>I imagined how safe he must have felt going in and out of there, because I know I did. Even though it had been years since I had lived there, it was kind of like finding out that it had happened to somebody on your block. </p> <p>The Beatles meant everything to me growing up, and John was part of that. I loved Lennon's persona. He knew who he was and he knew what he represented to a worldwide public. John knew he had the floor; he knew he had to parlay that into something. I think he incited and inspired a whole group of youth to speak out and say what they felt. </p> <p><strong> Drew Barrymore</strong> </p> <p> When he died I was only five. I just remember when I discovered the Beatles, feeling sad because the one that I loved so much wasn't here. It was the early Eighties, and then I didn't listen to the Beatles for a few years after that. </p> <p>I really got into them again when I was 16, and it's been all I've listened to since then. That's when I really started falling in love with John Lennon. Every song he sings, I freak. I feel like I can't speak eloquently enough. Anything in life, whatever your question is for the universe, if you put on a John Lennon song, he will answer you. </p> <p>I think 'Watching the Wheels' is the song I love the most, because it is so true. I completely feel like that song. I feel like sometimes he's saying that the people he's talking about are himself - himself looking at himself. And just how perfect a song it is for how we feel inside our own minds: We're trying to go on these paths that feel right and good to us, but we're always questioning how it's affecting others along the way. </p> <p>He gave everyone great music to be sad to and make love to and laugh to and drive to, and every sort of thing that you live for in the world. If you put his music on to anything that you're doing in life, it fits right alongside of it. </p> <p> <strong> Peter Fonda</strong> </p> <p> I was ploughing the snow from my driveway in Montana in the morning, and I went inside and heard on the news that he had been shot the night before. </p> <p>I couldn't imagine why somebody would want to shoot someone who had done so much explaining of our lives through his art. </p> <p>I met the Beatles individually in 1965, then spent a couple of days with them. We took LSD at my house. I knew John was having trouble with me. We put on a movie of Jane's, and he was upset. There was too much Fonda going on: my dad, myself, my sister. But as the trip wore on, he became easier with me. I was right there with him the whole time. We ended up in the bathroom, in a big sunken tub - fortunately not filled with water - playing electric guitars that were amplified by the room, singing songs. </p> <p>Out of that experience came 'She Said, She Said'. John said in Rolling Stone that I had something to do with that song. I thought it was so far out that he had made something of it. He used the exact words I said to George, [Harrison] who thought he was dying during the acid trip. I had said: 'I know what it's like to be dead.' </p> <p>John and George are sitting at the table with me, and John says: 'How do you know what it's like to be dead?' And I said: 'I shot myself when I was a boy. But by accident. Everything was all right in my mind.' Of course, it wasn't. Then I hear the song: 'When I was a boy/ Everything was right.' </p> <p>I see Lennon's influence in my children. They think of 'Imagine' as an anthem. There's a generational zap there. The Beatles wrote these crowd-pleasing dance songs, which evolved into songs of our moments on this planet. </p> <p>Thank God we had him, that his essence didn't float by us to some other place. We got lucky. </p> <p> <strong> Steven Tyler</strong> </p> <p> I remember going to write alone up in New Hampshire - to get in touch with my insides. Then, when I heard the news, it was almost too much for my insides to handle. It ripped out a piece of me - I don't know how to say it any other way. I was so angry for so long - I was physically angry for years after that fucker shot him. It felt good to have a cry because I was so fuckin' pissed off. </p> <p>As a kid, I used to go down to Greenwich Village all the time and fantasise I was going to bump into one of the Beatles or Stones. I never got to meet John, but I always felt like I knew him anyway. The Beatles taught us to fly, and John taught us to freefall back to earth. All songwriters ever want to do is crawl inside other people's souls and psyches, and somehow change everything. Jesus, what part of John or the Beatles did not get inside every one of us? </p> <p> <strong> Wyclef Jean</strong> </p> <p> When I heard that John Lennon had died, I was in my grandmother's house in Brooklyn. I was like: 'That's fucked up.' I was mad, young. I got that same butterfly feeling in my stomach when Marvin Gaye died. It was completely unexplainable. I didn't even know the guy. </p> <p>Lennon was just a great songwriter. The simplicity with which he wrote songs... it's something even a child can understand. But it's not easy to write a simple song. And every one of Lennon's songs had a dope hook. </p> <p>He wrote about what was going on, and he always encouraged world peace. Like Bob Marley and even Sting, he transcended his border to make a difference. He came to New York and sang about the Vietnam war. Although he never saw world peace, I think he changed a lot of people's minds. </p> <p> <strong> Graham Nash</strong> </p> <p> I was lying on my bed watching Monday night football - it was Miami and the New England Patriots - when I heard the news. Howard Cosell broke the news. Apart from being very, very upset by the loss of someone whom I had met many times, the first thing that occurred to me was wondering how many songs we were never going to get to hear, that were working around in his head. </p> <p>I'd been acquainted with John since about 1958, before the Beatles. The first time I actually met him was at the Cavern in Liverpool in 1962, when the Hollies were playing on the same bill as the Beatles. John was always on the front edge - it's very much the same as what Neil Young does. All those incredible people are always on the front edge. And sometimes they fall, and sometimes they fly. John's legacy is that he gave as much dignity to the common man as he could. He stood for dignity and respect and songs that had a reason for being. </p> <p> <strong> David Crosby</strong> </p> <p> I don't remember where I was at the time. I just remember being very depressed, because I loved him very deeply. We were friends. I found him to be smart, acerbic, shrewd, witty and a good guy. He and the other Beatles were all very kind to us when we came over to England as the Byrds. They kind of took us under their wing, and from that point forward, we saw each other a lot. Whenever they came to the United States, I would go to the gigs and hang out with them. </p> <p>For me, John Lennon's legacy is his songs - all those brilliant, beautiful, incredible pieces of work. John was a very fierce guy - he wasn't a shy little human being. He was a guy with strong opinions, and he had no problem expressing them. </p> <p> <strong> Art Garfunkel</strong> </p> <p> I remember the day John Lennon died. I was recording at Criteria Studios in Miami, making my Scissors Cut album. I was doing vocals that night, and the second engineer interrupted and said: 'I have terrible news to tell you.' I took a long pause, and I tried to carry on, and I failed, and I came into the control room, and I said: 'That's it for tonight; I can't work. I can't speak, I don't know what to say.' </p> <p>I knew him a little bit, and he was unbelievably engaging. At the Dakota once, after dinner, he pulls me into the bedroom, so I'm sitting on the end of his bed, and he says: 'I want you to tell me about your work with Paul Simon, because I understand you just recorded in Nashville together.' We had just done 'My Little Town'. 'I'm getting calls from my Paul,' he said, 'who's doing an Allen Toussaint project. And he wants to know if I'm available for the recording. What should I do?' Can you imagine how I felt? John Lennon asking me for my advice? I could have pinched myself at that moment, because it made me realise in a flash: no wonder he captivated the whole goddamned world - he's so commercial. </p> <p>He knew what to say to me that was connected and human and real and grounded and fascinating. And that's what he did with the whole planet earth. He was a hit record - his very being was like a hit. And I said to him: 'John, I would do it - put all personality aside and go with the fun of the blend. Make music with somebody you have made a sound with. A great pleasure is the thing to stick with.' He didn't take my advice. </p> <p> <strong> Joe Strummer</strong> </p> <p> I can't remember where I read this, but it struck me, so I'll repeat it: the Beatles were from the first generation of working-class kids in Britain, after the war and rationing and all, who were asked to think about their feelings - and to express themselves in an artistic way. Obviously, Lennon was a one-off, but it's amazing to think of what might have been wasted in other generations. Part of his legacy is opening the door to people who'd never been allowed to dream of such things. We'll compare our new geniuses against that one forever. </p> <p> <strong> Johnny Marr</strong> </p> <p> I was still at school. I remember the news being on the radio and television; the whole country seemed to be in shock, it was all anyone could talk about. </p> <p>The Beatles stuff has always seemed to be there, the sound of Lennon and McCartney's voices together is a part of British culture. I can remember reruns of A Hard Day's Night and Help and my earliest memory is of seeing him playing harmonica on 'Love Me Do'. His legacy has transcended that of the pop star; he's now a political symbol, a modern mystic. </p> <p> <strong> Mike Myers</strong> </p> <p> I was watching Monday night football. My father referred to it as an 'assassination'. That's how much impact his death had in our house. </p> <p>My parents are from Liverpool. So you can imagine, he was a god in our house. To say we were intensely proud would be an understatement. I even went through a time when I actually thought I was related to him because he had the same accent as my mum and dad. What I admired most about John was that he was faithfully his own man, and he let his heart dictate his actions. </p> <p> <strong> Hunter Davies</strong> </p> <p> My diary tells me I had a very poorly leg that day; that's the sort of dopey stuff I record. I'd got injured playing football and was hobbling around. And moaning around. I see I was also doing a children's book, proceeds to charity, and my editor was chasing me for copy. So I woke up that morning, groaning at the day ahead. </p> <p>It was the Jimmy Young programme which informed me. I did a chat with Jim, and then the phone never stopped. Once you do one, they all want you. Since doing my biog in 1968, I'd tried to keep out of Beatles stuff, feeling a fraud, my knowledge so out of date. The day turned into chaos, so my diary says. The full horror of it didn't strike me for several weeks. </p> <p> <strong> Neil Harrison aka John Lennon in the Bootleg Beatles</strong> </p> <p> I was in the Bootlegs when he died. We'd been going since about March of that year and we'd just played Keele University. We woke up on the ninth and the landlady of the digs we were staying at said that John Lennon had been shot in New York. She didn't say shot dead. Then we switched on the news and found out he was dead. We drove back to London and we couldn't say a word. We were dumbstruck. </p> <p> Some of these interviews first appeared in Rolling Stone. Others are by Kim Bunce and Chloe Diski</p>",

      "bodyText": "Keith Richards I was downtown on Fifth Avenue in New York. The first bit of news I got, I thought: 'He'll make it. It's just a flesh wound.' And then, later on, the news really came. He wasn't just a mate of mine, he was a mate of everybody's, really. He was a funny guy. And you realise that you're stunned. You really don't believe it. And you think, 'God, why can't I do anything about it?' I got well drunk on it. And I had another one for John. Then there was the confusion, the phone calls, trying to find out if Yoko was OK. There were the Beatles, and there was John. As a band, they were a great unit. But John, he was his own man. We got along very well. We didn't see each other very often, but he would sort of turn up at your hotel. Usually, if I was in the city, I'd stay at the Plaza. If John turned up, that meant he wanted to party. He didn't come there to discuss, you know, philosophy, although it would end up like that. I would just get into town, and there'd be a knock at the door: 'Hey, mon, what is going on around here?' We would get the guitars down and sing. And, in our spare time, discuss world domination. He's rubbed off on me as much as anybody. A bit of me rubbed off on John, too, you know. He took it with him. My father just passed away, and he winked at me just before he died. I really feel a lot better about death now. I'm getting off on that wink. I'd give the wink to John. Marianne Faithfull I had just gotten into a minicab in London when the news came on, and then they played all John Lennon songs. The first was 'A Day in the Life'. I was completely shocked but, in a way, not that surprised. The most amazing time I ever had with John is when we went to see the maharishi, and that's when I really got closest to him. He was so funny. I was always a bit frightened of him because he was so incredibly clever. The weekend we went to Bangor where the maharishi was delivering a lecture was very intense because we all went on the train there: the Beatles and me and Mick Jagger and the maharishi. Then, over the weekend, we got the news that Brian Epstein had overdosed. John was devastated. I wish I'd gone on the retreat in India - not because I liked the maharishi, because I didn't. Just to be there to hear Lennon's asides and to watch the whole thing unravel - because it did. I would have loved to be there for that. Noel Gallagher I was in my front-room in Manchester listening to a football match, and they interrupted it to say that John Lennon had been assassinated. It was like, 'Fuck'; it was just silence, really. Especially for my mum; she was a teenager in the Sixties and into the Beatles. Lennon dying had a more profound effect on her than on me, because at the time I was 13. I didn't know what it meant until I dissected 'the White Album'. And then I thought: 'Fuck, this guy is not even around any more.' Lennon's legacy is absolutely 100 per cent his music. I'm not really interested in his politics or his bandwagon-jumping towards the end of his life. His music is just completely timeless and unsurpassable. If it wasn't for John Lennon, I think that Paul McCartney would have had the Beatles writing 'Yesterday' right up until the day that they split up. Ask any cutting-edge musicians in London, like the Chemical Brothers or Prodigy, if you trace all that music backwards, it all stops at 'Tomorrow Never Knows'. It was 1966 when Lennon wrote that song. All the other songs that were around, it was still all, 'You love me/ I love you/ Whoopie-doo'. Lennon wanted to sound like a thousand monks chanting on top of a hill. He's probably still 20 years ahead of his time. Sting I think the Police had just come offstage in Miami. I was told that he'd been shot, and I had the reaction that everybody had - disbelief, shock, horror. What happens when people like him die is that the landscape changes. You know, a mountain disappears, a river is gone. And I think his death was probably as significant as that. The Beatles were formative in my upbringing, my education. They came from a very similar background - the industrial towns in England, working class; they wrote their own songs, conquered the world. That was the blueprint for lots of other British kids to try to do the same. We all miss him, and I think about him every time I walk by that building. Michael Douglas I have a newborn son, so I've been listening a lot to 'Beautiful Boy'. John wrote it for Sean, and it's a lovely song to a child. It's been bringing back all of those times for me, in the Sixties and Seventies, when the Beatles and Lennon meant so much. And with the election, I'm reminded of how politics today could really use John Lennon - his truthfulness. He's needed. Ronnie Spector I first met him in London in 1963. The Ronettes were the top group in England at the time. He saw us and got in touch with our manager, and there was this party and we danced all night with all the fellas, taught them the New York dances. He liked me for more than just my voice. As the party wound down, we started talking. I was just 19 years old, and starting to make it big, and he knew things. He told me: 'It's all going to change, you're going to start riding in limousines.' I'm, like, 'You're kidding me!' I met him in the street years later. He called my name: 'Ronnie!' and I turned around; it was so fucking cool. When he called my name, everyone turned around and saw him (and recognised him), and he didn't care. He got shot right after that. When he was shot, I was so devastated, I stayed in bed for a week. I was in the studio when I heard; I just dropped the phone - it broke my heart. I always think of John Lennon every time I'm in the recording studio. I can't help it. He's my spirit talking to me, saying: 'Don't give up.' Lenny Kravitz I met Yoko Ono and Sean on my first tour. For my birthday one year, Yoko gave me one of John's shirts. It's black, one of those disco rollerskating shirts; he used to wear those tight, glittery shirts. Today, I think John would be doing some cutting-edge hardcore music. His first solo record is one of the most hardcore pieces of music ever recorded. And at the end of 'Mother', when he's saying, 'Mama, don't go, Daddy, come home', his soul is just spilling out; it's so hardcore. Sinead O'Connor It was my twelfth birthday and I was walking home from school. I guess I would have been young enough to not see death as being entirely disastrous. The nature of my own personality is that I don't see death as a disastrous thing. It's just a door that opens, and somebody goes somewhere else. Lennon had a sense of everybody's right to stir shit. He was very brave and vulnerable, and saw that it was brave to show one's vulnerability. He would probably love the rap movement. In a lot of ways, rap is where his voice can still be heard. People underestimate the subliminal impact of not just his music but the things he was doing publicly, like the shit-stirring. All of that had a huge influence on rap, and on little, bold, big-mouthed Irish singers. You almost forget how sexy he was. Plus, he was wonderful and gorgeous. Sheryl Crow I was watching Monday night football at the University of Missouri and Howard Cosell announced Lennon's death. He basically denounced the importance of the game and proclaimed that one of this generation's icons had been killed. In the band that most influenced music and, moreover, culture, he represented the rock'n'roll attitude of rebellion, dissatisfaction and social consciousness, the idea that we as people can expand our minds, grow, live together and love in peace. He tried to incorporate those ideals in his music and his life. His influence is everywhere - in every rock'n'roll singer-songwriter.

If you put his music on to anything that you're doing in life, it fits right alongside of it.

John was always on the front edge - it's very much the same as what Neil Young does. All those incredible people are always on the front edge. And sometimes they fall, and sometimes they fly. John's legacy is that he gave as much dignity to the common man as he could. He stood for dignity and respect and songs that had a reason for being. David Crosby I don't remember where I was at the time. I just remember being very depressed, because I loved him very deeply. We were friends. I found him to be smart, acerbic, shrewd, witty and a good guy. He and the other Beatles were all very kind to us when we came over to England as the Byrds. They kind of took us under their wing, and from that point forward, we saw each other a lot. Whenever they came to the United States, I would go to the gigs and hang out with them. For me, John Lennon's legacy is his songs - all those brilliant, beautiful, incredible pieces of work. John was a very fierce guy - he wasn't a shy little human being. He was a guy with strong opinions, and he had no problem expressing them. Art Garfunkel I remember the day John Lennon died. I was recording at Criteria Studios in Miami, making my Scissors Cut album. I was doing vocals that night, and the second engineer interrupted and said: 'I have terrible news to tell you.' I took a long pause, and I tried to carry on, and I failed, and I came into the control room, and I said: 'That's it for tonight; I can't work. I can't speak, I don't know what to say.' I knew him a little bit, and he was unbelievably engaging. At the Dakota once, after dinner, he pulls me into the bedroom, so I'm sitting on the end of his bed, and he says: 'I want you to tell me about your work with Paul Simon, because I understand you just recorded in Nashville together.' We had just done 'My Little Town'. 'I'm getting calls from my Paul,' he said, 'who's doing an Allen Toussaint project. And he wants to know if I'm available for the recording. What should I do?' Can you imagine how I felt? John Lennon asking me for my advice? I could have pinched myself at that moment, because it made me realise in a flash: no wonder he captivated the whole goddamned world - he's so commercial. He knew what to say to me that was connected and human and real and grounded and fascinating. And that's what he did with the whole planet earth. He was a hit record - his very being was like a hit. And I said to him: 'John, I would do it - put all personality aside and go with the fun of the blend. Make music with somebody you have made a sound with. A great pleasure is the thing to stick with.' He didn't take my advice. Joe Strummer I can't remember where I read this, but it struck me, so I'll repeat it: the Beatles were from the first generation of working-class kids in Britain, after the war and rationing and all, who were asked to think about their feelings - and to express themselves in an artistic way. Obviously, Lennon was a one-off, but it's amazing to think of what might have been wasted in other generations. Part of his legacy is opening the door to people who'd never been allowed to dream of such things. We'll compare our new geniuses against that one forever. Johnny Marr I was still at school. I remember the news being on the radio and television; the whole country seemed to be in shock, it was all anyone could talk about. The Beatles stuff has always seemed to be there, the sound of Lennon and McCartney's voices together is a part of British culture. I can remember reruns of A Hard Day's Night and Help and my earliest memory is of seeing him playing harmonica on 'Love Me Do'. His legacy has transcended that of the pop star; he's now a political symbol, a modern mystic. Mike Myers I was watching Monday night football. My father referred to it as an 'assassination'. That's how much impact his death had in our house. My parents are from Liverpool. So you can imagine, he was a god in our house. To say we were intensely proud would be an understatement. I even went through a time when I actually thought I was related to him because he had the same accent as my mum and dad. What I admired most about John was that he was faithfully his own man, and he let his heart dictate his actions. Hunter Davies My diary tells me I had a very poorly leg that day; that's the sort of dopey stuff I record. I'd got injured playing football and was hobbling around. And moaning around. I see I was also doing a children's book, proceeds to charity, and my editor was chasing me for copy. So I woke up that morning, groaning at the day ahead. It was the Jimmy Young programme which informed me. I did a chat with Jim, and then the phone never stopped. Once you do one, they all want you. Since doing my biog in 1968, I'd tried to keep out of Beatles stuff, feeling a fraud, my knowledge so out of date. The day turned into chaos, so my diary says. The full horror of it didn't strike me for several weeks. Neil Harrison aka John Lennon in the Bootleg Beatles I was in the Bootlegs when he died. We'd been going since about March of that year and we'd just played Keele University. We woke up on the ninth and the landlady of the digs we were staying at said that John Lennon had been shot in New York. She didn't say shot dead. Then we switched on the news and found out he was dead. We drove back to London and we couldn't say a word. We were dumbstruck. Some of these interviews first appeared in Rolling Stone. Others are by Kim Bunce and Chloe Diski",

He is the most dynamic figure in Spain's best-known red-wine region, a whirlwind who believes Rioja is capable of producing wines to rival the finest in the world. He thinks the rot started in the late-19th century, when merchants from Bordeaux crossed the Pyrenees to find a new source of wine after the phylloxera vine louse wiped out most of France's vineyards. 'They made standardised wines and their legacy is still with us,' he says. </p> <p>When phylloxera hit Rioja in turn, many of the best hillside vineyards were abandoned in favour of easier cultivation down on the plain. It's only in the past 20 years that people have started to rediscover the old terraces. The result has been a new generation of estate and single-vineyard wines that, in de Gregorio's opinion, reflect their origins far more faithfully than the traditional style. These new wines are made mainly, or exclusively, from Tempranillo. Thanks to them, it has finally started to deliver, producing wines of considerable structure and complexity. </p> <p>The self-confidence of de Gregorio, shared by the owners of other modern operations such as Martinez Bujanda, Contino, Roda, Glorioso, Ijalba, Bar\u00f3n de Chirel, Artadi and Marqu\u00e9s de Vitoria, is at odds with what's happening in the market place. The last year has been a disastrous one for Rioja, with sales falling by a third in the UK. The reason for this was simple enough: price.

The majority of the region's 55,000 hectares of vineyards are owned by 18,000 growers, who sell their grapes to co-operatives and wineries.

      "body": "<p>I try not use the C word in my kitchen until it is absolutely necessary. With the inevitable festivities and their accompanying food mountain now only 21 days away, I don't really have any choice but to use it today. Try as I might, I can ignore it no longer. Christmas is here. </p> <p>While I warm to this time of obligatory feasting and enforced jollity a little more each year, it is still far from my favourite time of the year - in food terms, at least. I may, of course, simply be getting softer, but I like the ingredients of Christmas cooking more than I used to. In baking terms alone, the quality of the bits and pieces we have to work with now is streets ahead of what it used to be even a couple of years ago. </p> <p>The undyed glac\u00e9 cherries, organically produced vine fruits, unrefined icing sugars, single-bean chocolate and traditionally milled flours that have replaced the chocolate-flavour cake covering and hundreds and thousands of yesteryear are a privilege to work with. Add to that the new baking ingredients, such as maple-scented sugars, genuine vanilla extracts and mi-cuit plums (a juicy, semi-dried fruit, held somewhere between plum and prune and available from most major supermarkets), and you have a good reason to get even the most reluctant of bakers into the kitchen. </p> <p>Most of us make some sort of attempt at cakes, cookies, chocolate and pastry - what I call cakery - at this time of year, but I am not sure we should feel obliged to follow tradition. If the usual vine-fruit mixtures for cakes, pudding and mince pies don't appeal, then make something lighter or swap it for a tart of some sort. Or perhaps a tray of biscuits, a basket of blueberry muffins or a thick slab of chocolate embedded with nuts and crystallised fruits. If you have never turned your kitchen into a therapy room with exotic wafts of ginger and allspice, the warm sting of orange peel and a trail of cinnamon clouds, then I can wholly recommend it. Baking is back big-time this year. I guarantee even the most hard-hearted of us will have a cake in the oven by the end of the month. </p> <p>Others may prefer a half-hour of quality time rolling cookies into star shapes. I make a shortbread-based biscuit then stud it with dried cranberries or cherries and pecan nuts. Warm from the oven, it is as festive as any mince pie. Those with a love of good eating, but who prefer something simpler and cleaner on the palate than Christmas cake may like to look up Gordon Ramsay's Orange and Lemon Tart in his book A Chef for All Seasons (\u00a325, Quadrille). Better still, eat it at his eponymous London restaurant. </p> <p>This a vintage year for cookbooks and almost all have a splendid baking recipe or two in them. I have mentioned Tamasin Day Lewis's Art of the Tart (\u00a316.99, Cassell) before, but those who bought her book might like to think about making her Prune, Almond and Armagnac Tart this Christmas Eve and offering it to those who have no love of The Pudding. Rowley Leigh's No Place Like Home (\u00a325, Fourth Estate), whose venison recipe I featured last week, has both a festive Cinnamon Ice and Baked Quinces with Cinnamon and Vin Santo. Either would be a heavenly escape from the average Boxing Day trifle. </p> <p>Ruth Watson's Really Helpful Cookbook (\u00a320, Ebury) is one of the year's most successful books - partly for the humour and warmth of the writing, but also because the recipes are actually things you want to eat. It has an entire chapter devoted to Wintry Puddings. Here be suet pudd stuffed with bittersweet Seville oranges; damson and apple cobbler; coconut pancakes with maple, pecan and rum butter; hot mincemeat parcels and marzipan baklava. Any of those would go down well at Christmas. Ruth's recipe for egg custard tart - a perfect example of its kind - is something for those who want to offer an elegant antidote to the sticky, gooey, boozy stuff that invariably turns up at this time of year. </p> <p>If I can't tempt you to get out the butter, sugar, chocolate and flour this Christmas, then maybe Nigella will. Her book How to be a Domestic Goddess (\u00a325, Chatto) is a roll call of everything you have always intended to make for those you love but somehow never have. Working on the premise that it is impossible not to fall in love with someone who has a tray of cookies in their oven, Nigella has produced a truly seductive read. </p> <p>Here are some alternatives to the season's surfeit of dried fruit, brown sugar and booze. </p> <p> <strong> Maple-sugar biscuits</strong> </p> <p>Crumbly cookies, sweet with the warm, honeyed flavour of maple sugar and tart with cranberries. You could use light brown sugar if the maple variety eludes you, but that would be missing out on its deeply buttery flavour. If you feel you cannot cope with 30 biscuits at once, freeze any remaining mixture in a takeaway-type carton. You can find maple sugar at La Fromagerie (020 7359 7440 for mail-order enquiries). Makes about 30. </p> <p><strong>80g maple sugar </strong></p> <p><strong>150g salted butter, cut into cubes </strong></p> <p><strong>1 large egg </strong></p> <p><strong>75g self-raising flour </strong></p> <p><strong>100g ground almonds </strong></p> <p><strong>75g shelled pecan nuts </strong></p> <p><strong>75g dried cranberries </strong></p> <p><strong>plus a little maple sugar for dusting </strong></p> <p>Set the oven at 190 C/gas mark 5. Put the sugar, butter and egg into a mixing bowl and cream it together till quite smooth. You don't really need to be terribly thorough about this, but even so, you will find a hand-held electric whisk much less trouble than a wooden spoon. Stir in the flour and the ground almonds, roughly chop the pecans and add those along with the dried cranberries, folding them in with a spoon until everything is well mixed. </p> <p>Take walnut-sized lumps of the mixture in your fingers and roll them gently in a little more maple sugar, then place them on a baking sheet, pushing them down gently with the back of a spoon. They will be all the more interesting for being left knobbly and rough hewn. A centimetre on each side of them will allow them to spread without touching the next cookie. </p> <p>Bake the biscuits for 8 or 9 minutes, till they are golden. Leave them for a minute or two before you lift them with a palette knife on to a wire rack to cool. They are delectable eaten slightly warm. </p> <p><strong> Ruth Watson's baked egg custard</strong></p> <p>A gentle cream custard for those who want something more elegant after The Turkey.

Put the milk, cream and orange zest into a largish saucepan over a low to medium heat, and slowly bring the contents to a simmer. Immediately remove the pan from the heat, pour in the rum and leave the milk to infuse for about 15 minutes. In the meantime, whisk the sugar, whole eggs and yolks until thoroughly combined. Strain the milk on to the egg mixture (discarding the zest), stir well and add the vanilla extract. </p> <p>Pour the custard mixture into the dish, grate on nutmeg, and bake on the middle shelf of the oven for 1 hour, or until the custard has set (gently push the top with a finger to test). Serve at room temperature.</p> <p><strong> Nigella Lawson's snow-topped spice cake</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> 4 large eggs, separated, plus 2 extra large egg whites </strong></p> <p><strong>125ml vegetable oil </strong></p> <p><strong>125ml water </strong></p> <p><strong>2 tbsp runny honey </strong></p> <p><strong>200g dark muscavado sugar </strong></p> <p><strong>75g ground almonds </strong></p> <p><strong>150g plain flour </strong></p> <p><strong>2 tsp baking powder </strong></p> <p><strong>1 tsp bicarbonate of soda </strong></p> <p><strong>pinch of salt </strong></p> <p><strong>1 tsp ground ginger </strong></p> <p><strong>1 tsp cinnamon </strong></p> <p><strong>tsp allspice </strong></p> <p><strong>tsp ground cloves </strong></p> <p><strong>zest of an orange </strong></p> <p><strong>100g caster sugar </strong></p> <p><strong>25cm Bunt tin, well buttered </strong> </p> <p> for the icing</p> <p><strong>250g instant royal icing </strong></p> <p>Preheat the oven to 180 C/gas mark 4.

In another bowl, beat the egg whites until soft peaks form, then gradually add the caster sugar. Fold the whites into the cake mixture and pour into the tin. </p> <p>Cook for 45 minutes, or until the cake is springy on top and beginning to shrink away from the edges. Let the cake cool in its tin on a rack for 25 minutes before turning it out. When it is cold, make up the icing. Put the icing sugar in a bowl with as much water as specified on the packet and whisk until thick (or else it will just melt into the damp stickiness of the cake). Use more icing if you want a thicker coating, but leave to dry before slicing.</p>",

The reason for its eventual sad demise will also be its location in Borough. </p> <p>Before we discuss the gloomy news, however, let's deal with the good stuff. At first glance the restaurant would seem blighted by that location. It is tucked away down the kind of cobbled lane on which children with rickets might once gleefully have danced. Down here, the only passing trade is probably the rodents scurrying bashfully down the dank gutters. </p> <p>Walk just a dozen yards along the street, however, and you come face to face with the great, shadowed canopy of sooty old Borough market. Three years ago, a one-off food fair was held here for small, mainly organic producers of meat, fish, fruit and vegetables from across the country. It was such a success that, two years ago, the food market began running once a month. A year ago, it went to every Saturday, and now it is held on Fridays, too. Both days it throngs with food obsessives indulging themselves in a kind of ripe pornography for the middle classes. We move about its aisles, our lips moist with anticipation, ready to open our wallets wide in return for a particular kind of sensory gratification. </p> <p>Here you will not only be confronted by the very best produce this country can offer, you will also find yourself at the heart of a network of suppliers which keeps the storerooms of Britain's best restaurants fully stocked. There's Turnips, the fruit and vegetable supplier, which sells to the Conran restaurants, to Aubergine and Nico Ladenis, and whose display is so plump and burgeoning it is practically indecent. </p> <p>Next to them is Brindisa, importers of great Spanish charcuterie and cheeses, which supplies the Ivy in London, the Fat Duck at Bray and the Crooked Billet in Newton Longville, among others. Opposite is the stall for Northfields Farm, which supplies rare-breed beef to Hambleton Hall in Rutland. There's the Ginger Pig, whose stunning pork has been served up at Oliver Peyton's restaurants in Manchester, and further down the market there's wild beef from Hillhead Farm on Dartmoor, which is used at Gidleigh Park in Devon. The Wyndham's House Poultry Company from Yeovil in Somerset supplies the Conran restaurants; Seldom Seen Farm in Leicestershire supplies its organic geese to the Ritz and the House of Lords. </p> <p>Naturally, now that the market is such a vast success, it is threatened with closure. Railtrack needs to expand its train routes into London and has decided that the only way to do so is to double the width of the viaduct that crosses over the top. A public inquiry into the development is underway, but many of the traders concede that the work is likely to go ahead in two years' time. And that will close down the market until 2004 and require the knocking down of a couple of dozen Georgian houses. </p> <p>Though the weekly food extravaganza at Borough is a complete joy, it is still quite hard to justify going to the barricades for what is, essentially, an event for those with plump bank balances. (You can imagine the chant on the demo: 'What do we want? Wild beef. When do we want it? Just after the fish course.') But it's still a huge shame. Because when the work starts it will also take out the kitchen at the back of the Petit Robert and the restaurant will have to close. </p> <p>So enjoy it while it's there. Like the market, it is a simple and straightforward place: a boxlike room painted a strangely calming shade of orange in which one can eat good-quality food in unpretentious surroundings. It should be said that the food is not the main reason for going there, though it is better in an unfussy French sort of a way, than that would suggest. </p> <p>I went with another Robert, a restaurateur, who thought his starter of quail's-egg tart Florentine absolutely fine, if unstartling. While his partridge in a blueberry sauce could have arrived hotter, it was a good piece of gamey meat and a great, if shockingly blue, sauce. Likewise, my frogs' legs with garlic was the Ronseal of restaurant dishes: it did exactly what it said on the menu. Grilled rack of lamb was a sturdy piece of meat on a mustard sauce that was not too intrusive. Side vegetables were limp, but the chips were perfect. </p> <p>So that's the food. The real selling point is the wine. Robert picked up the list and began muttering to himself. As far as he could see, the mark-up was rarely more than 100 per cent on retail, when the industry standard is around 300 per cent. The first bottle we wanted was out of stock so we chose another. Robert Didier, the Robert of Petit Robert who, as it happens, isn't at all (he's chunky and broad shouldered) was unimpressed. He suggested a Saint-Emillion which was \u00a39 cheaper. It was an extraordinary bottle of wine for \u00a320: deep and subtle. We asked how he could afford to do this. 'I don't bother with a percentage mark-up,' he said. 'I just make \u00a35 clear profit on each bottle.' The result is some serious bargains. </p> <p>We didn't fancy pudding, but a line at the bottom of the menu caught our attention. We were invited to turn the page for 'the best list of Armagnacs in London'. So we did. And it was. It began with an 1830 at what seems like a weirdly reasonable \u00a3165 a glass from the very last bottle in existence, and then moved on through the rest of the 19th century to cover most of the 20th. We each chose one from the year of our birth, a 1959 for Robert at \u00a311 a glass and a 1966 for me at \u00a36.50. They were both sublime. </p> <p>The Petit Robert is a joy and, if you don't splurge on Armagnac, a pretty reasonable one (though, of course, not splurging on Armagnac would be missing the point). When the bulldozers come to Borough in two years' time it will, says not-very-petit Robert, relocate either to Devon or Oxford. That will be London's loss. But boy will some other town gain.</p> <p>\u0095 Petit Robert, 3 Park Street, London SE1 (020 7357 7003). Lunch, including wine and service (but excluding Armagnac), costs around \u00a360 for two.

      "body": "<p>At this time of year, the specifics start to fade from the garden, leeched out by low light and hibernation. The garden goes into a spell of introversion. There are very few gardens that would suffer anything from a regime of complete neglect throughout the month of December.</p> <p>The gardening world falls into two camps at this point. There are the conscientious gardeners, motivated primarily by the desire to run a tight ship, who work hard to keep the garden behaving itself. The lawn is mown, vegetables looked after and the purely decorative elements tended with due care and attention. If these gardens rarely sing, then at least they also rarely slouch.</p> <p>For those of us who see our gardens as an entity much greater than the sum of its human parts, it is a month of enforced idleness, at a time when there is least to do. It is a time of year when reflection is more useful and constructive than getting down into the dirt. Perhaps it is a male thing that one thinks too little in the garden, anyway. I know that I am often driven to distraction (wholly unreasonably) by Sarah's habit of not responding to a question, the silence thickening as the seconds thump by until pressed for a - any - kind of reply, she will say, 'I'm thinking.'</p> <p>It is in the garden as it is with words. Just as I will often say something to see what I am thinking, so I will plant things together to see if that is where and how I want them. The actions inform the thoughts which, in turn, set up a reaction and response that I was incapable of thinking up initially. Sarah would rather do nothing (in the garden) for a long period than do what she thought was the wrong thing. Yet when she has thought things through, she acts decisively and with conviction. We both tend to reach the same place at the same time via these wholly different routes.</p> <p> Is this a male/female thing and never the twain shall meet? Or is that just lazy gender stereotyping? I would hesitate to make a clear split down gender lines but, for what it is worth, I do think that there is a real and important difference between masculine and feminine gardening. </p> <p>Here goes: masculine gardening is based on control and creating order. The lines have a tendency to be straight. Masculine gardening imposes a blueprint on to the landscape and gets enormous pleasure from seeing it executed. This is all of a piece with the masculine gardener's desire to dominate the landscape. The most male gardens are the Dutch 17th-century gardens, where everything is symmetrical and geometric, lines ranging out to the greater landscape from a tightly clipped - and perfectly lovely - formal interior.</p> <p> Masculine gardening likes measurement. How big, how heavy and how long are things that matter to the male psyche. The male universe is constantly measured both as an attempt to chart its unfathomable essence and also as a fixed point against which to measure masculinity itself. The central male ontological question is not What or Who am I, but How do I measure up? This inevitably leads to competition, and masculine gardening is forever looking over its shoulder at other gardeners and their own set of measurements.</p> <p>If this sounds negative or a bit limited, there are real masculine virtues. The masculine gardener can see the bigger picture. He (or she - this is not strictly a gender divide) can put the garden in context - particularly helpful in bigger gardens where you inevitably end up with a series of gardens united by a theme or personality. Masculine gardeners use the garden as a retreat from the world at large, freeing themselves from the turmoil of business, politics (office or otherwise), work in general.</p> <p>Masculinity has to be seen to work as yet another measurement of self-worth, and the garden is a place where that work can assume a more private and calming role.</p> <p>The feminine gardener sees the garden as an extension of domesticity. In gender terms, the stereotype dictates that men are outdoors, women in, and that inevitably informs the roles that we enact. Femininity tackles the skills of indoor home-making and carries it outside, too. There is a stronger level of maintaining domestic order - cleaning and tidying not as an attempt to order the landscape at large but to keep on top of the household.</p> <p>I read in the paper today that old canard that women take up gardening when they give up sex. It was, of course, written by a man. It assumes that either women who garden are no longer interested in sex (or, I realise, are subtly no longer interesting as a sex object) and are therefore 'reduced' to gardening as a form of sensual pleasure, or that the available sexual partner is such a poor option that the joys of gardening are preferable. Both are reductively silly. I would suggest that the truth is made up of two aspects of 'feminine' gardening.</p> <p>The first is the realisation that the garden offers a wonderful escape from the demands of the household. Masculine gardening is an attempt to escape the world, whereas feminine gardening escapes the household. It is time on your own without children or spouses making demands. The second factor is known by feminine gardeners of all ages, which is that the garden is an intensely sensual place. Put simply, a lovely garden on a lovely day, however modest, can provide the richest range of sensual experiences that daily life has to offer. And yes, that includes sex with some dullard, middle-aged, pot-bellied, measurement-obsessed male partner.</p> <p> I think the real essence of feminine-attitude gardening is that it is responsive and reactive rather than proactive. This does not mean it is not able to make decisions or designs, but rather that it observes what is going on and tunes into it before attempting to impose a scheme on to the garden. It lets things accrue and interact and create their own balance. That balance is at the heart of all really good gardens. It is not enough to say that a garden looks good; it has to be good as well.</p> <p>Now, here is the crunch. Neither pure femininity nor unalloyed masculinity make good gardens or gardeners. You need a balance. Sometimes this can come from two people, combining the rigour and broader vision of one with the sensitivity and subtlety of the other, and is an incredibly satisfying way of expressing a relationship.</p> <p>The truth is that it is usually mingled within all of us, but I think it no accident that the men who are most comfortable with their femininity and the women with their masculinity make better gardeners than those who are locked into gender types. Gardening can empower women to be more physical and proactive and liberates men to be more reflective and interactive.</p> <p>But however wedded to your gender you are, of this you can be sure: the deity of the garden is a goddess and she is not mocked.</p> <p><strong>My roots: A week in Monty's garden </strong></p> <p>This is the third day of frost we have had and yet the garden still manages to remain wet. Working in the borders with freezing, wet hands is about as horrible as it gets, but they are starting to look very sorry and must be cleared up. </p> <p>I left the salvias in the ground for as long as possible, because although the growth was stringy and falling all over the place, Salvia elegans and S guaranitica in particular were still producing flowers. The plant was scarcely improved by the brief magenta and blue dashes, but I couldn't bring myself to remove them. But now they have succumbed and they will go to the shredding pile.</p> <p>I had a letter the other day from someone complaining about my advocacy of shredders on the grounds that the noise, pollution and fuel used were doing more harm than the good of recycling the material. I have found that chopping up stalky stuff with a machete (surprisingly available in the local hardware shop) and putting it on the compost heap works pretty well, but is no good for the really woody stuff. My rule is that I shred what I otherwise would have burned on the bonfire, which primarily means all prunings.</p> <p>The snowdrops are all appearing like green bullets firing up through the earth and I have been going round lifting the carapace of sodden leaves from them. This, I suspect, is a show of tenderness rather than any real help. But a lot of plants suffer from the accretion of soggy leaves rotting over them and I try to clear as many as possible. The leaves have been falling reluctantly this year, and are still clinging on.</p> <p>All the 'Bishop of Llandaff' dahlia tubers are dug up, dried and stored now. They came out of the ground as succulently plump as sweet potatoes and you can see how the original importers to Spain dismissed them as not worth growing on account of their taste. We are storing them in a mixture of 50:50 dried loam and perlite.</p> <p>Last year, they were in vermiculite, but it is expensive and might keep them a little dry. We have quite a lot now as all the cuttings I took last spring have grown well. I feel rather embarrassed by the lack of imagination in only having the clich\u00e9d 'Bishop' (although the colour is wonderful) but next year I will definitely expand our dahlia horizons.</p> <p>Our red curly kale is looking fantastic, although if anyone has any tips on how to cook it so that it can be reasonably digested, I should be very grateful to receive them via <a href=\"mailto:montydon@btclick.com\">montydon@btclick.com</a></p> <p><strong>Your roots: Recommended reading for winter gardeners </strong></p> <p>Having sniped a little at the RHS, it is time to give some credit where it is due. I have just received The Royal Horticultural Society Propagating Plants (edited by Alan Toogood, \u00a325, Dorling Kindersley) and can highly recommend it. </p> <p>Plant propagation is the really thrilling part of gardening and too many gardeners are daunted by it. This book should put that to rights. It is in a series with Pests &amp; Diseases, Pruning &amp; Training and Water Gardening, and all are very clear, simply explained and encyclopedic. This kind of educational work is where the RHS comes into its own, and any or all of these would make excellent Christmas presents.</p>",

The truth is that it is usually mingled within all of us, but I think it no accident that the men who are most comfortable with their femininity and the women with their masculinity make better gardeners than those who are locked into gender types. Gardening can empower women to be more physical and proactive and liberates men to be more reflective and interactive. But however wedded to your gender you are, of this you can be sure: the deity of the garden is a goddess and she is not mocked. My roots: A week in Monty's garden This is the third day of frost we have had and yet the garden still manages to remain wet. Working in the borders with freezing, wet hands is about as horrible as it gets, but they are starting to look very sorry and must be cleared up. I left the salvias in the ground for as long as possible, because although the growth was stringy and falling all over the place, Salvia elegans and S guaranitica in particular were still producing flowers. The plant was scarcely improved by the brief magenta and blue dashes, but I couldn't bring myself to remove them. But now they have succumbed and they will go to the shredding pile. I had a letter the other day from someone complaining about my advocacy of shredders on the grounds that the noise, pollution and fuel used were doing more harm than the good of recycling the material. I have found that chopping up stalky stuff with a machete (surprisingly available in the local hardware shop) and putting it on the compost heap works pretty well, but is no good for the really woody stuff. My rule is that I shred what I otherwise would have burned on the bonfire, which primarily means all prunings. The snowdrops are all appearing like green bullets firing up through the earth and I have been going round lifting the carapace of sodden leaves from them. This, I suspect, is a show of tenderness rather than any real help. But a lot of plants suffer from the accretion of soggy leaves rotting over them and I try to clear as many as possible. The leaves have been falling reluctantly this year, and are still clinging on. All the 'Bishop of Llandaff' dahlia tubers are dug up, dried and stored now. They came out of the ground as succulently plump as sweet potatoes and you can see how the original importers to Spain dismissed them as not worth growing on account of their taste. We are storing them in a mixture of 50:50 dried loam and perlite. Last year, they were in vermiculite, but it is expensive and might keep them a little dry. We have quite a lot now as all the cuttings I took last spring have grown well. I feel rather embarrassed by the lack of imagination in only having the clich\u00e9d 'Bishop' (although the colour is wonderful) but next year I will definitely expand our dahlia horizons. Our red curly kale is looking fantastic, although if anyone has any tips on how to cook it so that it can be reasonably digested, I should be very grateful to receive them via montydon@btclick.com Your roots: Recommended reading for winter gardeners Having sniped a little at the RHS, it is time to give some credit where it is due. I have just received The Royal Horticultural Society Propagating Plants (edited by Alan Toogood, \u00a325, Dorling Kindersley) and can highly recommend it. Plant propagation is the really thrilling part of gardening and too many gardeners are daunted by it. This book should put that to rights. It is in a series with Pests &amp; Diseases, Pruning &amp; Training and Water Gardening, and all are very clear, simply explained and encyclopedic. This kind of educational work is where the RHS comes into its own, and any or all of these would make excellent Christmas presents.",

      "body": "<p>I've been listening to Lord Archer of Weston-super-Mare explain himself for about an hour, I suppose, when he informs me that the person he really would most like to have been in this life is Willie Nelson. In a way, of course, you are not really surprised by any ambition that the novelist might care to admit to - this is a man, after all, who has variously imagined himself into the life of an Oxford graduate and a Tory grandee and a bestselling fiction writer, then woken up to find it true. Still, this particular confession does give me momentary pause. Which particular aspect of the country music legend did he admire, I wonder? The gift for tax evasion? The steady stream of dixie chicks? The plaits ? 'Oh,' he says, typically impatient when the absurd does not seem plausible, ' just being on the road singing your songs ... '</p> <p>Archer's troubadour spirit has, perhaps, been pricked in recent weeks by a spell on tour with his new courtroom drama, The Accused, in which he plays a doctor on trial for the murder of his wife. I'd caught up with the play in Guildford, its last home before a transfer to the West End this week. Archer's acting, in relation to the excellent cast around him, is not quite authentic enough to be wooden, more MDF, but that does not get in the way of an entertaining evening - not least for the surreal parallels it offers between fiction and fact. The play concludes with the audience, as jury, being asked to decide the Archer character's fate. When I went, he got off; on other, less sympathetic, nights he has gone down for 17 years.</p> <p>He has, he says, along the way, been getting extensive tuition about how to behave in the witness box. 'Edward De Souza [who stars in the play] is coming by later to go over it again,' he says. 'We have a masterclass every day.' Being natural was clearly the challenge. 'Right at the beginning they said, \"You're singing and you're reciting,\" so we got rid of those. Then they said \"You're static.\" I was standing in the box gripping the rail going, \"No. I. Wasn't. There.\" Teddy de Souza said: \"when you are asked a question, just glance at the audience, the jury, and then glance back and deliver your line ...\"'</p> <p>Archer performs this action, glances confidently at me, then says with absolute smoothness and plausibility: '\"But of course I wasn't there that evening,\"' and smiles. 'Teddy de Souza is a tutor at RADA,' he says. (And you never know, I think, when such training might come in handy).</p> <p>It is a curious thing to interview Jeffrey Archer. The man you want to question, of course, is the one who appears in Michael Crick's extraordinary biography, the chancer son of the con man and bigamist, the man who inveigled his way into university using a qualification from a correspondence body building course, the man who had his minder slip the prostitute Monica Coghlan a brown envelope at Victoria Station. But that person, in Archer's mind, seems never really to have existed, and you are left instead sitting opposite someone who routinely, and repeatedly, ascribes to himself the qualities of 'innocence' and 'naivety' - 'you see, Tim, I have no cynicism in me' - and who responds to any question which seems to contradict this version, with a curt 'no comment'. Currently, for legal reasons (Archer's trial, for perverting the course of justice and perjury, is set for next spring) the range of possible inquiry is further circumscribed. In response, the temptation is to write a sub-Through the Keyhole article about his soft furnishings, or his butler, or his Vermeer, or the spectacular Thames view from his penthouse window.</p> <p>I wonder why he continues to see journalists. 'I just have this naive enthusiasm,' he says. 'I won't believe you are all bad people. I believe in giving you the benefit of the doubt.'</p> <p>Does he feel he has always been so helpful to the press about details of his past?</p> <p>'I haven't discussed my past for years,' he says, irritated, 'and I'm not going to start now.'</p> <p>But isn't it because the facts of his life are so difficult to establish, that puts journalists on the offensive?</p> <p>'Well,' he says, despairing a little. 'Some journalists only want to hear things they've heard before they get here.' He shakes his head, sadly. 'You can't do anything with that ,' he says. 'There's no way of handling that ...'</p> <p>The previous week he'd done his harumphing 'no comment' routine with Deborah Orr of the Independent, and 'kicked her out' after a couple of questions. So we talk, as I've been reminded to talk, about the play and nothing but the play.</p> <p>There are, I say, many jokey references in The Accused to his own history in the courts, most obviously the pivotal scene in which the doctor is asked to remove his shirt, to confirm his alleged mistress's description of distinguishing marks (which Archer famously did not do in the High Court). Does he think that those details add a layer of irony to the drama?</p> <p>'Oh, yes,' he says, smiling. 'But if it was only that, and the play was no good ... and they'd only paid \u00a320 to see me sitting in the dock, they'd want their money back ...'</p> <p>What prompted him to want to address these issues in this way?</p> <p>'I think it all comes out subconsciously almost,' Archer suggests, 'the scar on the back was too tempting to resist, I'm afraid... But it's not my story. Murdering someone with potassium chloride ... I think you'll find Mary is very well and in Cambridge, thank you very much ...'</p> <p>If the play has an extended run in the West End, he could be in court during the day and on stage at night. Did that prospect worry him? 'I love,' says Archer, beaming, 'the idea of teasing.'</p> <p>While he is talking, Archer's manner fluctuates between aggrieved headmaster and naughty schoolboy, and his face never seems absolutely sure which side of the detention desk it is supposed to be on. Oddly, the image that stayed with me long after I finished Crick's book was of Archer playing Puck at Dover College, where he taught PE. He gained his entrance to the stage by leaping over a hedge from a platform or a trampoline. It has often seemed as though he has since perfected this two-footed entr\u00e9e into most areas of his life. 'I was a wicked Puck,' he agrees now, 'dancing about, kicking everyone, jumping over them, causing trouble ... it was an ideal part for me.' Archer likes to think of himself as mischievous, surprising. With all his teasing and game playing, does he, I wonder, ever fear he might lose sight of who Jeffrey Archer really is?</p> <p>' Don't be absurd! ' he mock-yells, 'Of course I know who Jeffrey Archer is! And if I didn't, I have a wife and a family to remind me!'</p> <p>Given the unflagging support of that family, he must regret, I suggest, what he's put them through at times?</p> <p>'Of course,' he says, briefly, momentarily repentant. Then, brightly: 'But as they often remind me there is always the other side to the coin ...' He looks beatifically around his penthouse, with its Henry Moores, and its Vermeer, and its view of the Millennium Wheel. I think for a second that he is referring to the idea that his family know the real Jeffrey and don't believe what they read in the papers. But then I realise see that the other side of the coin is, in fact, the penthouse and the Vermeer and the view.</p> <p>And there is, of course, a side of Archer that is distinctly un-Puckish. When I ask, for example, if, when writing about the alleged affair between the senior doctor and the junior nurse, on which his play hinges, he could draw on some of his own encounters, in particular his relationship with Andrina Colquhoun, his former personal assistant, it is this Archer that answers.</p> <p>' Oh no, no, no ,' he says, sneering, as if at my impertinence. 'You're the first person ever to mention that. Andrina was never, ever in my mind when I wrote that part. The girl couldn't be less like Andrina. No connection at all ...' He pauses for a moment, in his sudden indignation. 'Though another girl in contention for the part did look like my wife,' he says, 'or at least my wife 25 years ago ...'</p> <p>There is a short silence, while we consider this remark; a silence in which I feel freezing on my tongue a question about Sally Farmiloe - the Howard's Way starlet who has recently revealed the details of a three-year affair with Archer, her 'Wonder Boy'. He eyes the door, and instead I say, 'Do you think adultery is the great subject for drama?'</p> <p>'No comment,' he replies, in ringing tones. Then he lets out a triumphant laugh. 'Though I did hear one woman going out at the interval in the play, saying' - and he does his best Hyacinth Bouquet voice - '\"Of course a professional man would never get involved with a slut like that!\"' He thinks this is hilarious. 'I thought: Wait a moment! Wait a moment! ' he says, suddenly spluttering. 'I wanted to chase after her and say: One, she's not a slut, not a slut at all , and: Two, I suspect there are quite a few professional men who do often go to bed with sluts Madam, quite a few!'</p> <p>Later, when I wonder whether or not he thinks juries are more inclined to trust figures who look like they belong to the establishment, he latches on to the idea as if considering it for the first time. The defendant he plays in The Accused comes armed with a list of qualifications (a list which, sadly, does not include the IFPC body building course). His alleged mistress, meanwhile, the leading prosecution witness, comes only with her stories of his infidelities, their early morning sex on his couch. In those circumstances, Archer muses, hypothetically, yes, he does suppose the jury is apt to acquit.</p> <p>Is it, I wonder, that kind of in-built respect the British have for establishment figures that has made him at such pains to become one?</p> <p>'No, no,' he says, 'not at all ... I've never wanted to be part of the establishment.'</p> <p>He was Deputy Chairman of the Conservative Party ... 'Well. I suppose, if you call that establishment ...' he says. 'Yeah. OK. But I'd always rather be with the people than with the powers that be ... I'm the man, remember, who wanted the title of \"Lord\" to be abolished.'</p> <p>But he still accepted it ... 'Well, but I wanted to be the first \"Mister\" in the upper house.'</p> <p>Was he hurt, I wonder, by the way the party treated him after the mayoral fiasco, withdrawing the whip and his membership for five years?</p> <p>'Half of them are coming to see the play,' he says, grinning.</p> <p>'Is William Hague coming?'</p> <p>'Well it doesn't open till Thursday ...'</p> <p>His candidature, of course, was publicly endorsed not only by his party leader but also by two former Prime Ministers. I wonder if he had retained, at least, the friendship of Lady Thatcher and John Major?</p> <p>At the mention of the baroness's name, his voice takes on a hushed tone. 'Margaret stayed with us for the weekend a couple of weeks ago,' he says. 'John's always around.'</p> <p>Is it fun, I ask, when Margaret comes to stay?</p> <p>'Oh, she is very amusing in private,' he says. 'Very different.' Archer draws in closer, as if we are being eavesdropped. 'But I remember Mary saying something when we went on a trip to Tokyo with Margaret. \"She's a very serious woman isn't she?\", and that stuck with me. She is, she's very serious ... a very, very serious woman.' He ponders this for a moment, and then looks at me, as if a penny has dropped. 'That's her strength.'</p> <p>How close were they while she was in power?</p> <p>'How close?' he whispers, reverentially. 'How close?' He leans forward a little more. 'Well, let me say this, on the occasion of her sixty-fifth birthday, eight weeks before she resigned, she had eight people to dinner, and Mary and I were two of the eight.' He sits back, his voice almost inaudible with pride at the memory. 'She had the McAlpines, the Wakehams, and the Parkinsons, and us. So that shows who her real friends were. I was very honoured to be part of that team, at that dinner.'</p> <p>It certainly sounds, I suggest, like a jolly do.</p> <p>Apparently buoyed by the warmth of this recollection, Archer then goes into Puckish overdrive, now relating his finest hour on the athletics track, and next re-enacting the greatest catch ever made on a cricket field, a performance which leaves him spreadeagled. He talks of how he has turned down three offers from Hollywood, and of his hopes for his next novel which, oddly given his commitments, he plans to get down to in April. If I ever fancied writing any fiction, he suggests, I should come and talk to him, get some tips, as 'many journalists' apparently do.</p> <p>And then, before I go, we talk about his hero, Scott Fitzgerald, and he starts reciting, at some length, from memory, the last page of his favourite story from Bernice Bobs her Hair , a passage which made him 'scream with jealousy' when he first read it. The story is, he says, 'May Day', and it tells of a doomed provincial love affair that ends when the hero leaves for New York on the train. Archer adopts his best Edward de Souza naturalness for the farewell scene, which closes, in his version: '...\"Goodbye,\" she said. \"Goodbye,\" he said. And he sat down, closed the blind, and the sun went down on his youthful life.' Archer sits back, grinning.</p> <p>Later, when I go to check the quote, I can't find the scene anywhere in 'May Day', or, indeed, elsewhere. It is, though, I can't help noticing, the tale of an unresolved affair that ends with an unsatisfactory parting at a railway station. Maybe, you could say, this is simply another instance of Jeffrey's subconscious working overtime. Or maybe it is just, as Willie Nelson once had it, a case of 'Sweet Memories'.</p>",

And then, before I go, we talk about his hero, Scott Fitzgerald, and he starts reciting, at some length, from memory, the last page of his favourite story from Bernice Bobs her Hair , a passage which made him 'scream with jealousy' when he first read it. The story is, he says, 'May Day', and it tells of a doomed provincial love affair that ends when the hero leaves for New York on the train. Archer adopts his best Edward de Souza naturalness for the farewell scene, which closes, in his version: '...\"Goodbye,\" she said. \"Goodbye,\" he said. And he sat down, closed the blind, and the sun went down on his youthful life.' Archer sits back, grinning. Later, when I go to check the quote, I can't find the scene anywhere in 'May Day', or, indeed, elsewhere. It is, though, I can't help noticing, the tale of an unresolved affair that ends with an unsatisfactory parting at a railway station. Maybe, you could say, this is simply another instance of Jeffrey's subconscious working overtime. Or maybe it is just, as Willie Nelson once had it, a case of 'Sweet Memories'.",

Nice, the big EU conference on enlargement, vetoes, fundamental rights et al, is new, a setpiece of the week to come. But this isn't quite the usual lather that precedes European summits. This is Paranoia Gulch. Why is John Humphrys giving Europe's spokesman such a grisly grilling on the Today show?

But that does not mean all's fair in Euro war. </p> <p>Take an average page of the Mail, almost any day. 'Blair is ready to give away 17 of Britain's vetoes,' says the big headline. Gosh! You mean (much smaller type, half way through) that we won't want to veto 'the appointment of representatives to EU security missions' any longer? Or 'appointments to various committees'? If this is the start of the federal superstate, it's pretty small beer and Twiglets. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the Mail adds that an Austrian campaign to 'quit the union' is under way, and its previously obscure leader 'believes in' and 'shares' the wisdom of Margaret Thatcher. It would seem that the citizens of Austria - if they are ever heard from again on this matter - are natural Daily Mail readers. </p> <p>Where does fair reporting (or, indeed, warped reporting) end, and simple propaganda begin? The leaders of the official Fed Up Party think they know. It begins when the Sunday Times reveals that British squaddies in the new European rapid reaction force will have to wear the stars of the EU on their tunics (as opposed to the blue berets of the United Nations if they're seconded on UN duty). It begins when the Sun clears an editorial page to inquire: 'What happens if we have to rely on the French or Italians to fight for us? Or, God help us, the Belgians?' This isn't obviously 'fair' comment. This is delusional ranting with a racist tinge. And where is the editor of the Daily Telegraph ? He's in Washington DC delivering a public lecture about his legendary European antipathies. The role of the press as dispassionate adviser to its readers appears long, long gone. </p> <p>Wait, though, and turn the telescope the other way. Charles Moore of the Telegraph - who is bravely upfront in such matters - would argue that it's the job of papers to put countervailing views, especially when powerful vested interests (Whitehall, big business, the Brussels bureaucracy) are all singing the same siren song. Why do battling Brits take so much flak? Because they're doing their job as journalists. </p> <p>And here, in the Telegraph-owned Spectator, is the Mail columnist Stephen Glover, mounting a parallel defence. Why the wave of Blair/Cook attacks on the sceptic scribes? 'Because there will be some sort of compromise [at Nice] that will be interpreted by the \"anti-European press\". So the Government is pre-emptively debunking its critics in the hope that their howls of outrage will be discounted by the British people.' </p> <p>Ah, those 'people'. Glover rolls on: 'The fallacy [of the Government] depends on an exaggerated view of the power of the press which has been a hallmark of New Labour since its inception. It does not seem to occur to the Blairites that the British people are increasingly eurosceptic because of objective evidence - the failure of the euro, the undeniable means towards further integration - rather than as a result of media manipulation.' </p> <p>We ought to be clear. The trouble with this debate, vehemently waged on both sides, is that it is an archetypal dialogue of the deaf. Why does Glover write of 'the failure of the euro' as given fact when his opposite numbers in Frankfurt or Florence wouldn't dream of reaching the same conclusion - and Athens, even as he taps at his terminal, is signing up for the system? Are they utterly mad, or just reading different newspapers purveying different interpretations of the same data? </p> <p>The sceptical papers are indisputably right to say that the British 'people' have fallen out of love with euro membership. Seventy per cent poll ratings brook no dispute. But there's also an odd dislocation when that antipathy has to be fitted into a wider picture. The Labour Party, home of Blair and Cook, isn't in any public opinion crisis. On the contrary, the Mori latest survey for the Times finds it back to its sunny, summer ratings - 48 per cent - while the Tories languish a dismal 15 points behind and William Hague's popularity is at a new low. </p> <p>The party that leads the charge against the Europe we have, or are going to get, is the party that appears already to have written off the next election: the party whose leader goes to Nice prepared to 'give away' 17 vetoes cruises through by-elections unscratched. When the hallowed Thatcher weighs in against a rapid reaction force, the 'people' pay not a moment's heed. </p> <p>There are hard choices coming for the sceptical editors. The Telegraphs will support the Tories on election day, even though it's a losing ticket. But the Sun, last time, was a Blair backer, while the Mail, which warmed to Hague when he was fleetingly in the lead, is now in chilly agony. The boys want to save Britain, but they have no saviour worthy of the name - unless it be Gordon Brown some four or five years hence. Meanwhile Glover's 'people' speak with forked tongue. </p> <p>The 'European army' crusade seems to have left the voters unmoved. Thus frustration and concomitant fury grow. So on to Nice and angst redoubled. Messrs Blair and Cook will expect, and doubtless get, the worst. </p> <p>It would be good, however, if they didn't allege mere cynicism from their newspaper foes. Moore of the Telegraph and Paul Dacre of the Mail aren't insincere about their fears or their stories. They are true believers. The question for both sides is how far to up the ante. Some traditionally sceptical papers - such as the Times - appear to be making an effort to separate their cooler reportage from opinion. Some tread a more perilous path. For on one point, Glover is surely correct. The people aren't stupid: they know when things, in gathering hysteria, are going too far. And they can turn the page.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Michael Portillo told a lie last week. His declaration that 'I look forward to being a member of the next government' was a full-fat porkie, a 100 per cent whopper. I suppose there may be some Tories who can visualise their party forming the next government, though they must either be inhabitants of the Planet Zog or users of strong narcotics. Mr Portillo is not among them. A man as intelligent as the Shadow Chancellor does not imagine for a moment that he will be stretching his legs under the Cabinet table after the next election.</p> <p>Indeed, it has long been a universal assumption that the election that really brings a salivatory quiver to the lips of the quiffed one is the contest for the Conservative leadership which will follow another defeat. So when Mr Portillo also declares that he has 'no ambition to be leader of the Tory party', adding enigmatically that this is for 'very, very personal reasons', surely he is again abusing the veracity. Many of his colleagues certainly guffawed to hear El Caudillo forswearing the prize for which he has lusted so brazenly. Can this be the same Michael Portillo who pledged fealty to John Major while telephone lines were laid in for a leadership campaign? Pull the other one, Miguel. Cynical peals of laughter resounded down the corridors of Westminster. Those of a byzantine frame of mind have even managed to interpret his disavowal of further ambition as an especially cunning style of leadership bid.</p> <p>Myself, I'm inclined to take Portillo at his word when he makes his declaration of non-interest.

      "bodyText": "Michael Portillo told a lie last week. His declaration that 'I look forward to being a member of the next government' was a full-fat porkie, a 100 per cent whopper. I suppose there may be some Tories who can visualise their party forming the next government, though they must either be inhabitants of the Planet Zog or users of strong narcotics. Mr Portillo is not among them. A man as intelligent as the Shadow Chancellor does not imagine for a moment that he will be stretching his legs under the Cabinet table after the next election. Indeed, it has long been a universal assumption that the election that really brings a salivatory quiver to the lips of the quiffed one is the contest for the Conservative leadership which will follow another defeat. So when Mr Portillo also declares that he has 'no ambition to be leader of the Tory party', adding enigmatically that this is for 'very, very personal reasons', surely he is again abusing the veracity. Many of his colleagues certainly guffawed to hear El Caudillo forswearing the prize for which he has lusted so brazenly. Can this be the same Michael Portillo who pledged fealty to John Major while telephone lines were laid in for a leadership campaign? Pull the other one, Miguel. Cynical peals of laughter resounded down the corridors of Westminster. Those of a byzantine frame of mind have even managed to interpret his disavowal of further ambition as an especially cunning style of leadership bid. Myself, I'm inclined to take Portillo at his word when he makes his declaration of non-interest. I don't exclude the possibility that he might change his mind. His tortured statements of self-explanation leave him plenty of space to do so. But nor do I think it impossible that he might abandon the great game altogether. I even begin to think that might be most likely. For the Michael Portillo of today is not the same creature as the man who plotted against Major.

It begins: 'My name is Erin Law. My friends are January Carr and Mouse Gullane. This is the story of what happened when we sailed away from Whitegates that Friday night.' The three - 'We are damaged children' - run away from a children's home and launch a makeshift raft on the river. When they run aground on the muddy Black Middens, they meet the mysterious web-fingered Heaven Eyes. 'Is you mine sister?' she asks. 'Is these mine brothers?' </p> <p>She lives with filthy, black-bearded Granpa in an old warehouse. She is ethereal and elfin-like. He is mad and threatening and digs in the mud of the Middens every night in an obsessive search for treasures. Both are other-worldly. Or perhaps underworldly. They speak a strange, poetical, ungrammatical language and live on discarded chocolates and corned beef. They see real people as ghosts. Heaven Eyes is not sure if the three runaways are devils or angels. Nor is Granpa. 'There has been ghosts sometimes. We have hid from them, and if they have come too close then Granpa has fettled them,' says Heaven Eyes innocently and sinisterly. The three children live with them in an uneasy, allegorical alliance. Eventually, they must decide whether to go back and face their real lives - and what to do about Heaven Eyes. (10 up.) </p> <p>Melvyn Burgess has come up with a novel for a slightly younger audience than his usual. The Ghost Behind the Wall (Andersen \u00a39.99, pp130) is a terrific story told with typical empathy and verve. David lives with his dad. His mother left some time ago. When he discovers he can climb through the vent pipes in their block of flats and get into other flats and play tricks on people, all his fury and grief is channelled into this. His main victim is Robert Alveston, a happy and educated man in his nineties, who is lonely and starting to get a little fuzzy mentally. He thinks he is responsible for the havoc David wreaks. The situation is complicated by the sudden appearance of a vicious ghost that seems to have something to do with the old man. Why does the ghost hate Robert so? And how much trouble is he going to land David in? Robert and David are the only ones who can help each other out of the crisis that ensues. This is a book full of humour, excitement and glorious empathy with the characters - old, young, male and female. (10 up.) </p> <p>Two more ghost stories worth throwing in the stocking are Mary Arrigan's Grimstone's Ghost (Collins \u00a39.99, pp160) - this tale, of a brother and sister left alone to fight a malicious phantom in an old house, is written in a jokey, chatty style, but has quite a scary climax. (10-14.) - and Ann Turnbull's House of Ghosts (Walker \u00a39.99, pp126), a more gentle, but intriguing, story of two girls separated by more than a century but whose lives coincide. Good twist at the end. (10-14.) Joan Lingard's Natasha's Will (Puffin \u00a34.99, pp167) also relies on the past reaching into the present. Natasha fled revolutionary Russia as a child and settled in Scotland. Her best friend's grandchildren have lived with her and cared for her until her death, but unless they find her will they'll be turned out of their home. Natasha has left a series of clues and the story of her flight from her home is told in tandem with the family's struggle to solve her riddles. (10-14.) </p> <p>Still in a historical mode, Celia Rees's Witch Child (Bloomsbury \u00a310.99, pp235) is an exciting well-told tale that draws on the Salem witch hunts. Mary's grandmother is hanged for being a witch and Mary sets off for New England in the hope of a new life away from suspicion and fear. Hmm. Not the best place to go in the circumstances. (10-14.) Terry Jones's The Lady and the Squire (Pavilion \u00a312.99, pp304) is a lighter historical jaunt. Tremendous fun. (11 up.) </p> <p>Katherine Roberts's Spellfall (the Chicken House \u00a310.99, pp236) is a welcome and well-written addition to the sorcery genre. 'Natalie saw the first spell in the supermarket car park. It was floating in a puddle near the recycling bins, glimmering bronze and green in the October drizzle.' Hard to resist an opening like that and Natalie can't resist picking up what seems to be an old sweet wrapper. Little does she realise that this is going to lead to a strange journey into a parallel land. (10 up). </p> <p>Finally, for younger readers (eight up), Veronica Bennett's Dandelion and Bobcat (Walker \u00a39.99, pp139) is a well-written, funny story of a boy with a foster sister who has 'attitude'. Dyan Sheldon's Undercover Angel (Walker \u00a39.99, pp137) is another story about a foster child. This one claims to be an angel and seems to have a hand in making things happen. Well-developed characters, including the bewildered adults. Lynne Reid Banks's Harry the Poisonous Centipede's Big Adventure (Collins \u00a39.99, pp188) is worth a whirl, if only to discover that beetles speak in rhyme and that centipede language has no vwls. </p>",

      "body": "<p>His face is famous now. It shines out at us from all the newspapers and television screens, bright-eyed and sweet, with a joyful, gappy grin. An eager 10-year-old boy who came from the chaos of Nigeria, hoping to find a better life in Britain, and who, on a dark November afternoon, ended up bleeding to death in a grotty stairwell in Peckham. 'I will see him now, every minute, for the rest of my life,' said his grandmother.</p> <p>There's a shrine already growing at the site of his death. Bouquets of flowers are being laid there, and messages of anger and sorrow. The shrine will grow, for, as in the death of Diana, his story has stirred us all up, in pity and in shame and in the need to take part in the national mourning. It's like the Stephen Lawrence murder, like the killing of Sarah Payne, like James Bulger's death. The slaughter of innocence. How could it happen, and why?</p> <p>But while the James Bulger murder seems at first closest in kind, children killing a child, it's quite different. That was like something from another planet, or a grisly horror story made up to spook us at night: two 10-year-old boys snatching a toddler where he waited a few yards from his mother, walking him for hundreds of yards while he wept, torturing him, doing unspeakable things with batteries (they thought once he was dead they could get him going again), finishing him off.</p> <p>There was a grainy video recording of the toddler's abduction so we could watch the replay over and over, tragedy on a loop; there was a video-nasty that the little murderers had maybe watched and imitated. It was clear to most people what to think. We had a robust moral consensus: inadequate or bad parenting, foul television, evil boys and life should mean life. Like the Old Testament God, the public was filled with a need for vengeance.</p> <p>But whoever murdered Damilola Taylor presumably did it by mistake - the murderers are probably horrified and terrified by what they have done. They slashed him and ran off, leaving him to hobble a few steps for help, in the sudden fountain of his own blood. If they hadn't happened to have hit a major artery, it might have been one brief paragraph in the local newspaper; or not even that.</p> <p>If it was an act of depravity, it was the ordinary, nasty, diluted depravity of the way we live now. If it was an act of wickedness, it was wickedness that is being repeated, without the fatal consequences, each day all over the country. Boys are always beating up other boys, everyone knows that. The fact that something very common - ordinary violence - turned into something very uncommon - the murder of a child - places the Damilola Taylor story right at the heart of our society.</p> <p>This is not something set apart from us, that we can describe as evil and monstrous and unnatural, and shut away and forget about. It's with us, all around us, if only we look. It's a glimpse into the world in which we live. This other Britain is ours.</p> <p>Because of this, the little dead boy has become like a lightning rod for a wave of moral scrutiny. But his story has no simple reading. Everyone brings to him the meaning they want to find. He proves everybody's case for them.</p> <p>For moral conservatives, his murder is obviously to do with some kind of collapse of decency, four years after Labour came to power. They argue that there is not enough policing, and that lawlessness rages in housing estates like the one in Peckham, south London, where Damilola briefly lived. (Although, in fact, that particular area had made striking improvements in crime rates in recent years). Commentators who visited it talked of a place 'defaced by rubbish, covered in graffiti, dogged by violence and peopled by a horrifyingly high proportion of youths who are antisocial and prone to violence...'. They argue, too, that broken parenting is the root cause of male aggression and purposelessness. Boys brought up by single mothers go wrong more easily. The traditional family must be restored.</p> <p>On the other side of the fence, liberal critics point to social exclusion and poverty. The gulf that divides the increasingly wealthy from the disenfranchised poor deepens. The youths who are disruptive at school, who are excluded, who wander around the streets with knives, who scuffle on pavements and whose status rises with each act of brutal cool are victims as well as bullies. The culture of mindless machismo, where Damilola was called 'gay' and pushed around because he was eager to learn, is a culture which traps everybody.</p> <p>And somewhere in the uncomfortable middle territory is a new, anxious debate about black-on-black racism, which for many of us is a new one: Nigerians targeted by Afro-Caribbeans.</p> <p>Worried parents focus on bullying at school (a recent survey shows that 37 per cent of teenage boys say they have been subjected to physical violence), and the way in which boys who want to study are vulnerable to playground torments. They want to change the whole school culture, and many feel that teachers simply do not take bullying seriously enough, in spite of the widespread introduction of anti-bullying policies and of the subject of personal and social relations to the national curriculum.</p> <p>Teachers talk of being over-worked and under-valued; for many of them, Damilola was an accident waiting to happen, a shock but no surprise. Architects say housing estates like the ones in Peckham should be bulldozed; experts in city planning say that the problem is that they are being bulldozed too fast, fracturing what sense of community there is.</p> <p>Politicians talk about the 'walk on by' culture; the drug culture; the 'greed is good' and 'who wants to be a millionaire?' culture. We own so much now - we spend more of our money on leisure and entertainment than anything else.</p> <p>We have so many things: satellite TV and computers and mobile phones - and the next must-have is round the corner. But where is our spiritual centre? Religious leaders talk about a vacuum, where God once was, and faith. The blame shifts queasily from individual to family to state and all the way back again. Everyone's to blame. Nobody's to blame.</p> <p>There are no shared moral assumptions here, no dialogue between different ideologies. We are poles apart, sharing only the visceral pity at the thought of Damilola crawling along the road looking for help and never finding it.</p> <p>And what must his last minutes have been like? We search for reasons, desperately wanting a simple one that will unite us again. We feel that something has gone wrong, but we don't know what it is.</p> <p>It is hard to accept that there is no single reason in this bleak tale, and therefore no easy solution. Everyone's a little bit right: the boy was killed because of racism, machismo, an affectless and alienated society, deprivation, broken parenting, a terrible mistake, the worst luck - a whole cocktail of circumstances which coalesced one November afternoon, and it happened to be Damilola Taylor who was there.</p> <p>It could have been someone else, somewhere else. The James Bulger murder was a one-off, and nothing like that will happen again for a long, long time. The Damilola Taylor murder was not. It could happen again next week, next month.</p> <p>Which is why we should not forget too quickly. Damilola should be the ghost of Christmas present, haunting us with his sweet face and his short life and his lonely end.</p> <p><b>Related stories</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,3604,404947,00.html\">30 November: Straw appeals to public after 'evil' schoolboy murder</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,404836,00.html\">30 November: 'My son is dead and I am bitter'</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/leaders/story/0,3604,404700,00.html\">30 November, leader: Death in Peckham</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,404901,00.html\">30 November: Head defends bullying record</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/crime/article/0,2763,404903,00.html\">30 November: Estate is 'one of toughest in Europe'</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,404333,00.html\">29 November: Death of a schoolboy</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4097793,00.html\">29 November: It's lawless out there</a> <br></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.met.police.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Metropolitan police</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">The home office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/reports/100/100821.pdf\" target=\"_new\">Ofsted report: the Oliver Goldsmith primary school</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.southlondononline.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Local media: South London online</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.southwark.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">London borough of Southwark</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.thereal.com/o-041798.html\" target=\"_new\">Photographs of the North Peckham estate</a></p>",

Yet many people have to accept them because frequent long-distance travel is now a routine part of many workers' lives. What was once a perk is a pain in the neck. Welcome to business class syndrome. </p> <p>'I visited Amsterdam more than 50 times in two years and never saw anything beyond the airport, the office and the Holiday Inn over the road,' says business services consultant Martin Warne of his old job in cable television. 'All the travel sounded exciting but the reality was getting up at 5.30am. It was very stressful. At first I couldn't sleep the night before. You worry whether the car will turn up, and any delay on the road, at the airport or in the sky could mess up your schedule.' </p> <p>Despite apparent alternatives such as fax, email and tele-conferencing, business travel continues to grow. Some 14.8 million business passengers flew in and out of the UK last year, says the Civil Aviation Authority, and that number is increasing by about a million a year. </p> <p>'In the global economy more and more people deal with more and more countries,' says Warne, 'and it extends further down organisation. Many organisations have tele-conferencing, but often nobody knows how to use it.' </p> <p>Simon Beeching of travel club Wexas, which organises business and economy flights, says: 'It's now far more cost-effective to travel across the globe regularly for business. In the early Eighties, a round-the-world ticket to Australasia was at least \u00a31,250. Now it's \u00a3700.' </p> <p>So how does all that travel affect staff? Stephen Joy, now a marketing director at toymaker Mattel, has been a frequent traveller during his 16-year career. He believes business travel has become more stressful as it has become more common. </p> <p>'As your life gets fuller, with children and so on, it becomes more difficult,' he says. 'But, it's not just to do with age. Modern communications means that the only time you're truly out of reach is on the plane. You see everyone switch on their mobiles as they open the overhead luggage racks. When you get to the hotel you have to log on and get your email. In the past when you were away, you were away. Now you're expected to take the in-tray with you, and managing your work from afar can be very difficult, especially if you're in a different time zone.' </p> <p>As business travel has grown, companies have begun to pay increasing attention to its impact on profits. 'As a junior I travelled in much more comfort than I do now,' says Joy. 'Today costs are scrutinised. It is assumed that after an overnight flight you'll be in the office next morning - no fun if you haven't had a wink of sleep in a poky seat.' </p> <p>But surely the cost is more than just that of the ticket. How long is it before a worker is back to his or her best after a long flight? And what about the longer term damage to their health? </p> <p>Half of long-haul passengers have digestive problems and, because most airlines recirculate the air inside planes, mixing half fresh with half recycled, flu bugs and other airborne diseases are among the most frequent of frequent travellers. But new research suggests the health risks may be more serious than this, and that even jet lag - once seen as little more than a minor inconvenience - may be far more disruptive than we think. </p> <p>A recent House of Lords report, Air Travel and Health, identified the risk of blood clots and deep vein thromboses from sitting in cramped conditions for a long period of time. As many as one in 10 passengers could be affected. </p> <p>Beeching of Wexas says: 'The term \"economy class syndrome\" is a misnomer. One member of the House of Lords collapsed after a first class trip. It's to do with lack of mobility, not the class of seating.' Beeching recommends that travellers should drink plenty of non-alcoholic fluids, keep walking about and move their legs even while seated. Aspirin thins the blood but it is not suitable for everyone. Seek medical advice if you're considering this. </p> <p>The World Health Organisation is worried about the risk of tumours among regular flyers following research showing that flight attendants were twice as likely to get skin cancer and 30 per cent more likely to get breast cancer than the general population. These figures may be the result of lifestyle rather than airline travel, but with the average long-haul flight attendant being exposed to radiation equal to 250 chest X-rays a year there is understandable concern. </p> <p>Flying can bring on heart attacks. The reduced cabin pressure at high altitude cuts the amount of blood in the body and brain, increasing the chance of serious illness in at-risk individuals, particularly older passengers and those with high blood pressure. Eating and drinking before travel may cut the risk. </p> <p>Some employers recognise the disruption. 'Cadbury-Schweppes used to pay an allowance based on the number of days away to compensate,' says Mattel's Joy, while one of Beeching's business clients 'insists we get all his staff home by Friday evening regardless of expense'. But many firms are concerned with little more than cheap travel. </p> <p>There is a cost to the planet, too, says Friends of the Earth. One return flight to Florida creates as much carbon dioxide, the major greenhouse gas, as the average British motorist generates in a year. With firms increasingly being encouraged to look at environmental costs, has the time come to reassess attitudes to business travel?</p>",
