From afar, mind you, I had seen him all right in his beauteous prime. Not at Wembley in 1963 when Slim Jim's two goals beat England, but four years later when his Scots came down seething still at England's World Cup win the year before. </p> <p>Now Baxter's audacious and brazen natural-born swagger and virtuosity taunted Bobby Moore's home side almost to humiliation. He played them as a show-off uncle might with a six-year-old nephew on the beach. Scotland won 3-2, but they could have had six. Denis Law said: \"We could have given them a real good torching, but Jim just wanted to shame and demean them, tip-tap and fanny around them to make them look idiots.\" </p> <p>Which he did, outrageously, unforgettably - even to inspire a different sort of rhapsody from the poet Alan Sharp: \"If folklore is your thing, it will be clear that what Scotsmen value most is what Baxter had, they value the completely held conviction of their own superiority.

Doing his next best thing, Baxter bought a pub. A dozen years or so ago in Glasgow, a taxi-driver pointed out \"our Jim's\" pub, an unkempt front just down the road from his Ibrox, but I thought better of popping in even for a dram - \"and a large one f'y'self, mine merry host\" - and reminding him of our fraternally long (and lost) London night 20 years before. </p> <p>It was already enough for me to hoard the soaring panegyric from the writer Richard Brentnall: \"To see Jim now as he pulled pints for customers, his ruddy complexion and the way his flesh sagged over his belt ... Living proof we're all mere mortals, and if we bestow saintliness upon others then that's not their fault.\" Mind you, in that litany of football saints, Jim Baxter will forever remain an archangel. </p> <p>Just a month before Baxter's 1967 defining resplendence, at that same London stadium another miner's son - this one from the Somerset coalfield who became a wartime tank commander - had marched his Third Division Queens Park Rangers to win, outrageously, the League Cup at Wembley. </p> <p>Eight years later, Alec Stock had also taken (then) little Fulham to the 1975 FA Cup final. I got to relish and savour his convivial courtesies in that period. He had first made his name in 1949 by inventing the idea of a daunting \"slope\" at Southern Leaguers Yeovil Town - and had himself photographed by the Daily Graphic lying on the centre circle squinting at a tilting spirit-level - and frightening Bury and mighty Sunderland into still legendary defeats. </p> <p>Alec was manager to such maestros as Bobby Moore, Malcolm Macdonald, Alan Mullery and Rodney Marsh - and, briefly, George Best.

      "body": "<p>Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, which operates Q8 stations, was among those following Shell's lead yesterday by slapping 1p on the price of petrol. By the weekend, most, if not all, are expected to react to the steep jump in crude oil prices from $25 (\u00a317.5) a barrel on average late last week to $29 yesterday. </p> <p>\"Over the next couple of days, prices will go up by 1p or 2p a litre and, in the face of an election, the government can do nothing about it,\" said Jonathan Akerman of the Petroleum Retailers Association. \"Prices will do what they want between now and early June.\" </p> <p>The motoring lobby is clamouring for government action while some of September's fuel protesters are limbering up for a re-run. Garry Russell, of the Dump the Pump campaign, blames the government for a \"horrendous\" situation. Taxes on fuel are the highest in Europe but cuts made by the chancellor in his March budget have all but been wiped out by the latest fuel price rises. </p> <p>The latest trouble has been triggered from outside these shores, most notably through a round of production cuts imposed by oil cartrel Opec on April 1. The US, faced with shortages, is hoovering up surpluses from elsewhere in the world. </p> <p>The prevailing view among experts yesterday was that the fire and subsequent two to three week shutdown at the Conoco refinery on Humberside would have a negligible effect on prices. </p> <p>\"The central issue is the lack of product,\" said Leo Drollas, chief economist of the Saudi-backed Centre for Global Energy Studies. \"Killingholme produced some 230,000 barrels a day, half of it is exported - mainly to the US, which takes 80,000 in gasoline.\" </p> <p>The Conoco refinery accounts for 8% of Britain's supplies, but it was due for an annual shutdown for maintenance checks. </p> <p>In the US, where the \"driving season\" (holidays) takes place in June, insatiable and growing demand for gas has bumped up imports and, with them, global prices. </p> <p>According to Mr Drollas, the US now has just 23 days cover for petrol on average and 19 days for crude; a systemic failure would leave the world's biggest economy dangerously short. The US has not built a new refinery for 25 years despite rising demand. </p> <p>He expects prices for Brent crude to stay at about $25 this summer before rising to $28 on average in the fourth quarter - if Opec retains its cuts. </p> <p>\"Because of the tightening in the US the Americans are siphoning any surplus supplies and bidding up prices. The arbitrageurs move in and this pushes up prices in Europe,\" Mr Drollas said. US imports amount to the same as at least three Killingholme-style refineries. </p> <p>Drivers in Britain could expect an extra 1p or 2p a litre but the rise will be temporary. Unless, of course, the Middle East crisis blows up into a full scale war. </p> <p>That would propel prices at the pump way beyond the peak national average of 82.15p (for unleaded) seen last June, and certainly far above the present 74.3p or the 72.4p seen immediately after the chancellor's Budget cut in excise duties. </p> <p><strong> Government action</strong><br> </p> <p>Global explanations for higher prices cut little ice with the British motoring organisations. And the Conservatives were quick to make political capital out of the situation. Shadow chancellor Michael Portillo said figures out this week showed the poorest families were being hardest hit under Labour, after Gordon Brown increased taxes like petrol duty paid by everyone. </p> <p>\"It is Labour's stealth taxes that have given Britain's motorists the highest petrol prices in Europe. Conservatives will cut petrol tax and offer some relief to the hard-working families who have to pay too much to the Government every time they fill their tank,\" he explained. </p> <p>The RAC and AA renewed their calls for government action to reduce taxation, which makes British car owners pay more for fuel than anyone else in Europe. </p> <p>Edmund King, executive director of the RAC, said he was seeking a meeting with the government to call for stable fuel prices through the introduction of a sliding scale of duty, which would fluctuate with world prices. </p> <p>\"The last thing the UK needs is more fuel protests on top of the foot and mouth crisis. Our economic model shows that the government could stabilise fuel prices without losing revenue. Some motorists may be tempted to vote with their wheels.\" </p> <p>The Road Haulage Association (RHA) had the same message for Downing Street. RHA spokeswoman Kate Hill said foot and mouth was already hitting the business of its 9,500 trucking company members. \"Someone seems determined to drive the haulage industry out of business,\" she said. But a Treasury spokesman said the government had made considerable concessions, and he ruled out any other short-term fix. \"Tax decisions are set at the Budget, taking account of the government's economic and social objectives, and environmental commitments. \"The 2001 Budget provided a package of \u00a31.5bn for the motorist, including a duty freeze, reductions in ultra-low sulphur petrol and diesel, aimed at promoting cheaper, cleaner motoring.\" </p> <p>There is no doubt that prices will rise further. Exxon Mobil's British arm Esso, which increased its prices on April 6 along with BP and others, would not rule out further upwards movements on the forecourt. </p> <p>A spokeswoman said: \"Our retail price strategy is governed by Pricewatch, where we monitor fuel prices at supermarkets within three miles and other service stations within a mile of participating Esso stations. </p> <p>\"What we say is that prices will usually be among the lowest of those monitored.\" </p> <p>TotalFinaElf, which operates 1,300 garages, said that it was not implementing an across-the-board wholesale price increase. </p> <p>But a company spokesman said some retail outlets would put up prices in response to competitors' actions. </p> <p>Kuwait Petroleum said it had raised petrol prices by around one pence per litre at some of its Q8 branded forecourts in response to local price hikes introduced by its competitors. </p> <p>\"Where it's possible for us to remain competitive, we have put prices up in some areas,\" a Kuwait Petroleum spokesman said. </p> <p>Meanwhile, a spokesman for the supermarket chain Tesco said: \"We moved our prices the week before last as a result of rises in world fuel prices - we had held them down for some time but could not sustain that. At the moment we are monitoring the situation.\" </p> <p>BP said it had no further plans to increase at the current time. And there was some relief in the oil markets yesterday as prices fell after a series of data undermined their strength. </p> <p>Prices lost almost half a dollar yesterday.

      "bodyText": "Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, which operates Q8 stations, was among those following Shell's lead yesterday by slapping 1p on the price of petrol. By the weekend, most, if not all, are expected to react to the steep jump in crude oil prices from $25 (\u00a317.5) a barrel on average late last week to $29 yesterday. \"Over the next couple of days, prices will go up by 1p or 2p a litre and, in the face of an election, the government can do nothing about it,\" said Jonathan Akerman of the Petroleum Retailers Association. \"Prices will do what they want between now and early June.\" The motoring lobby is clamouring for government action while some of September's fuel protesters are limbering up for a re-run. Garry Russell, of the Dump the Pump campaign, blames the government for a \"horrendous\" situation. Taxes on fuel are the highest in Europe but cuts made by the chancellor in his March budget have all but been wiped out by the latest fuel price rises. The latest trouble has been triggered from outside these shores, most notably through a round of production cuts imposed by oil cartrel Opec on April 1. The US, faced with shortages, is hoovering up surpluses from elsewhere in the world. The prevailing view among experts yesterday was that the fire and subsequent two to three week shutdown at the Conoco refinery on Humberside would have a negligible effect on prices. \"The central issue is the lack of product,\" said Leo Drollas, chief economist of the Saudi-backed Centre for Global Energy Studies. \"Killingholme produced some 230,000 barrels a day, half of it is exported - mainly to the US, which takes 80,000 in gasoline.\" The Conoco refinery accounts for 8% of Britain's supplies, but it was due for an annual shutdown for maintenance checks. In the US, where the \"driving season\" (holidays) takes place in June, insatiable and growing demand for gas has bumped up imports and, with them, global prices. According to Mr Drollas, the US now has just 23 days cover for petrol on average and 19 days for crude; a systemic failure would leave the world's biggest economy dangerously short. The US has not built a new refinery for 25 years despite rising demand. He expects prices for Brent crude to stay at about $25 this summer before rising to $28 on average in the fourth quarter - if Opec retains its cuts. \"Because of the tightening in the US the Americans are siphoning any surplus supplies and bidding up prices. The arbitrageurs move in and this pushes up prices in Europe,\" Mr Drollas said. US imports amount to the same as at least three Killingholme-style refineries. Drivers in Britain could expect an extra 1p or 2p a litre but the rise will be temporary. Unless, of course, the Middle East crisis blows up into a full scale war. That would propel prices at the pump way beyond the peak national average of 82.15p (for unleaded) seen last June, and certainly far above the present 74.3p or the 72.4p seen immediately after the chancellor's Budget cut in excise duties. Government action Global explanations for higher prices cut little ice with the British motoring organisations. And the Conservatives were quick to make political capital out of the situation. Shadow chancellor Michael Portillo said figures out this week showed the poorest families were being hardest hit under Labour, after Gordon Brown increased taxes like petrol duty paid by everyone. \"It is Labour's stealth taxes that have given Britain's motorists the highest petrol prices in Europe. Conservatives will cut petrol tax and offer some relief to the hard-working families who have to pay too much to the Government every time they fill their tank,\" he explained. The RAC and AA renewed their calls for government action to reduce taxation, which makes British car owners pay more for fuel than anyone else in Europe. Edmund King, executive director of the RAC, said he was seeking a meeting with the government to call for stable fuel prices through the introduction of a sliding scale of duty, which would fluctuate with world prices. \"The last thing the UK needs is more fuel protests on top of the foot and mouth crisis. Our economic model shows that the government could stabilise fuel prices without losing revenue. Some motorists may be tempted to vote with their wheels.\" The Road Haulage Association (RHA) had the same message for Downing Street. RHA spokeswoman Kate Hill said foot and mouth was already hitting the business of its 9,500 trucking company members. \"Someone seems determined to drive the haulage industry out of business,\" she said. But a Treasury spokesman said the government had made considerable concessions, and he ruled out any other short-term fix. \"Tax decisions are set at the Budget, taking account of the government's economic and social objectives, and environmental commitments. \"The 2001 Budget provided a package of \u00a31.5bn for the motorist, including a duty freeze, reductions in ultra-low sulphur petrol and diesel, aimed at promoting cheaper, cleaner motoring.\" There is no doubt that prices will rise further. Exxon Mobil's British arm Esso, which increased its prices on April 6 along with BP and others, would not rule out further upwards movements on the forecourt. A spokeswoman said: \"Our retail price strategy is governed by Pricewatch, where we monitor fuel prices at supermarkets within three miles and other service stations within a mile of participating Esso stations. \"What we say is that prices will usually be among the lowest of those monitored.\" TotalFinaElf, which operates 1,300 garages, said that it was not implementing an across-the-board wholesale price increase. But a company spokesman said some retail outlets would put up prices in response to competitors' actions. Kuwait Petroleum said it had raised petrol prices by around one pence per litre at some of its Q8 branded forecourts in response to local price hikes introduced by its competitors. \"Where it's possible for us to remain competitive, we have put prices up in some areas,\" a Kuwait Petroleum spokesman said. Meanwhile, a spokesman for the supermarket chain Tesco said: \"We moved our prices the week before last as a result of rises in world fuel prices - we had held them down for some time but could not sustain that. At the moment we are monitoring the situation.\" BP said it had no further plans to increase at the current time. And there was some relief in the oil markets yesterday as prices fell after a series of data undermined their strength. Prices lost almost half a dollar yesterday. Sentiment improved as crude stocks in the US were shown to have swollen by 7m barrels to the highest levels in 20 months. Gasoline also took hefty losses of more than 1.5 cents a gallon, bringing prices down from Tuesday's nine-month peak. This followed a smaller than forecast reduction in inventories giving relief to concerns of a supply crunch in the summer. London's Brent crude slipped 43 cents in early dealings to $27.20 a barrel, while the US benchmark light crude for May fell 79 cents to $27.45. This brought prices down in the last two days to over one dollar. Industry body, the American Petroleum Institute, reported a 7.3m barrel increase in US crude stocks to 315.2m barrels. Gasoline inventories remain more than 8m barrels below last year's thin levels when pump prices hit record highs. Petrol production at Conoco's refinery on the Humber estuary is likely to be delayed for longer than expected because of the scale of damage to the plant, writes Martin Wainwright . All production at the 480 acre site in South Killingholme, part of the Immingham port complex, has stopped, although some of the usual 200 tankers a day are still taking stockpiled fuel to filling stations. Conoco said that initial investigations had shown the apparent source of the explosion to be the saturate gas unit.",

It said there was a risk that the economy would remain \"unnacceptably weak\". However, recent economic figures suggesting that the US economy might be bottoming out after a pronounced slowdown had appeared to lengthen the odds on a cut in rates before the central bank's next scheduled meeting on the issue in late May.

However, some analysts feared that the decision presaged as-yet unknown economic difficulties such as liquidity problems or over-exposure to bad debts. Ian Shepherdson, the chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, said the cut \"must also prompt the question of whether the Fed knows something we don't\". The chairman of the Fed, Alan Greenspan, who presided over the economic boom of the 1990s, has come under fire for the sharpness of the economic slowdown over the past six months. Economists have criticised his failure to cut rates last year. Art Hogan, the chief market analyst for Jefferies and Co, the US brokerage, said: \"This cut should certainly improve his popularity. As for his reputation, it will go down in history as pretty untarnished.\" The US economy grew at an annual rate of just 1% in the last quarter of 2000, the weakest performance in more than five years. Declines in the first three months of this year mean that the Fed is expected by many economists cut rates to as low as 4% this year. In a cheerful note to investors, Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, the Wall Street bank, wrote: \"We think the outlook for the market is pretty good.\" Guardian Unlimited Money",

      "body": "<p>AOL Time Warner bucked the recent trend for negative news yesterday when it revealed a 20% increase in profits in the last quarter. </p> <p>Shares in the world's largest media and internet group rose 8% soon after it released its first-quarter results as analysts welcomed the better than expected earnings and revenue growth during an economic downturn. </p> <p>Gerry Levin, the company's chief executive, said: \"The real strength of AOL Time Warner is magnified by our ability to deliver strong results in this kind of market.\" </p> <p>The company said that its wide range of assets - ranging from Time magazine to Warner Brothers film studio to the internet service provider - was the key to offsetting the impact of an economic slowdown and slowing advertising revenue. \"This enables us ... to generate sustained and consistent growth and to mitigate volatility,\" he said. </p> <p>Shares in AOL Time Warner have fallen since the beginning of the year amid doubts that the company could achieve the aggressive growth targets promised when the internet and media companies merged last year. </p> <p>Mr Levin reiterated his belief that the company was on course to meet those targets. He said that analysts would see \"not only good double-digit growth for our company in advertising, but even in more traditional markets\" going forward. </p> <p>Many of the company's rivals, including Walt Disney, Viacom and News Corp, have warned of declining revenues from advertising sales. </p> <p>Subscriptions from both internet and cable users spurred AOL's growth in the quarter. Mr Levin called AOL the company's \"jewel in the crown\" yesterday and suggested that the internet would be \"the world's largest mass-market medium ever seen\". </p> <p>Total subscriptions increased 16% to 133m in the quarter with the flagship internet service adding 2m members in the period for a total of almost 29m. About 6m of those subscribers were outside the US. </p> <p>Steve Case, company chairman, has promised strong growth for AOL's international business, forecasting an increase from a current 17% to half of all revenues within 10 years. Last year's merger, valued at $124bn (\u00a386.7bn), was the largest ever recorded. Yesterday's results mark the first time the two companies have presented consolidated quarterly results. </p> <p>After merger-related costs and investment write-downs were taken into account, the company managed to lose $1.4bn in the quarter, slightly better than $1.5bn last year. The amortisation of goodwill cost the company $1.8bn in the period. </p> <p>Still, Wall Street analysts welcomed earnings before exceptionals of 23 cents a share, or $2.1bn, three cents better than expected. </p> <p>In a note to investors, Henry Blodget and Jessica Reif Cohen, company analysts at Merrill Lynch, said: \"We view the company's results as impressive, particularly in light of a very difficult operating environment and industrywide advertising weakness.\" </p> <p>Revenues of $9.1bn, up 9% in the year, also exceeded expectations after a strong performance from subscriptions and the company's film business. Mr Levin also forecast a strong performance for the first film to be based on the Harry Porter novels, due out later this year. </p> <p>Company insiders have described their ability to withstand the downturn in advertising expenditure which has hurt so many competitors as a \"flight to quality\". </p> <p>With diminishing budgets, they hope companies are choosing AOL Time Warner's mixed bag of distribution outlets over smaller rivals. </p> <p>Advertising and commerce revenues rose 37% at AOL and 17% at Time Warner.</p>",

      "bodyText": "AOL Time Warner bucked the recent trend for negative news yesterday when it revealed a 20% increase in profits in the last quarter. Shares in the world's largest media and internet group rose 8% soon after it released its first-quarter results as analysts welcomed the better than expected earnings and revenue growth during an economic downturn. Gerry Levin, the company's chief executive, said: \"The real strength of AOL Time Warner is magnified by our ability to deliver strong results in this kind of market.\" The company said that its wide range of assets - ranging from Time magazine to Warner Brothers film studio to the internet service provider - was the key to offsetting the impact of an economic slowdown and slowing advertising revenue. \"This enables us ... to generate sustained and consistent growth and to mitigate volatility,\" he said. Shares in AOL Time Warner have fallen since the beginning of the year amid doubts that the company could achieve the aggressive growth targets promised when the internet and media companies merged last year. Mr Levin reiterated his belief that the company was on course to meet those targets. He said that analysts would see \"not only good double-digit growth for our company in advertising, but even in more traditional markets\" going forward. Many of the company's rivals, including Walt Disney, Viacom and News Corp, have warned of declining revenues from advertising sales. Subscriptions from both internet and cable users spurred AOL's growth in the quarter. Mr Levin called AOL the company's \"jewel in the crown\" yesterday and suggested that the internet would be \"the world's largest mass-market medium ever seen\". Total subscriptions increased 16% to 133m in the quarter with the flagship internet service adding 2m members in the period for a total of almost 29m. About 6m of those subscribers were outside the US. Steve Case, company chairman, has promised strong growth for AOL's international business, forecasting an increase from a current 17% to half of all revenues within 10 years. Last year's merger, valued at $124bn (\u00a386.7bn), was the largest ever recorded. Yesterday's results mark the first time the two companies have presented consolidated quarterly results. After merger-related costs and investment write-downs were taken into account, the company managed to lose $1.4bn in the quarter, slightly better than $1.5bn last year. The amortisation of goodwill cost the company $1.8bn in the period. Still, Wall Street analysts welcomed earnings before exceptionals of 23 cents a share, or $2.1bn, three cents better than expected. In a note to investors, Henry Blodget and Jessica Reif Cohen, company analysts at Merrill Lynch, said: \"We view the company's results as impressive, particularly in light of a very difficult operating environment and industrywide advertising weakness.\" Revenues of $9.1bn, up 9% in the year, also exceeded expectations after a strong performance from subscriptions and the company's film business. Mr Levin also forecast a strong performance for the first film to be based on the Harry Porter novels, due out later this year. Company insiders have described their ability to withstand the downturn in advertising expenditure which has hurt so many competitors as a \"flight to quality\". With diminishing budgets, they hope companies are choosing AOL Time Warner's mixed bag of distribution outlets over smaller rivals. Advertising and commerce revenues rose 37% at AOL and 17% at Time Warner.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>So often does the average footballer consider such-and-such the icing on the cake it is tempting to believe that behind the bland pleasantries there is a pastry chef struggling to get out. For Manchester United the Champions League is the cake, and everything else so much marzipan. </p> <p>On Saturday United became only the fourth English team to complete a championship hat-trick and they have now won the Premiership in seven seasons out of nine. Yet their manager Sir Alex Ferguson has no doubt about the effect on Old Trafford's season should his side fail to overturn Bayern Munich's first-leg lead here this evening. </p> <p>\"It will definitely create a hell of a flatness,\" Ferguson said. \"Of course winning the Premier League is always important but if we are to progress Europe is the place to do it. That is why losing now would be a big disappointment.\" </p> <p>Ferguson is convinced United will score against Bayern this time. \"If we can get a goal it will be very interesting,\" he mused. \"In fact there's nothing else for it: we've got to score.\" </p> <p>A one-match suspension following his booking when Bayern won at Old Trafford will deprive United of David Beckham's superior services tonight. In his absence Ferguson is expected to persist with Paul Scholes on the right, though tucking in to allow Gary Neville to overlap and provide the crosses. </p> <p>Bayern have lost their two wing-backs, Hasan Salihamidzic and Bixente Lizarazu, to suspensions. Ferguson feels Ottmar Hitzfeld's likely replacements, Willy Sagnol and Michael Tarnat, \"are both experienced but without the energy and the quickness of the other two\". Ryan Giggs, on whom so much depends, will hope this is true. </p> <p>As much will rest on Roy Keane and Nicky Butt preventing Stefan Effenberg and Jens Jeremies gaining the sort of control of the second leg that they did in the first. Effenberg's was the long pass nodded square by Thomas Linke for a substitute, Paulo Sergio, to appear from nowhere and win that game in the 86th minute. </p> <p>\"Losing was very disappointing,\" Ferguson said. \"Nil-nil would have been a fantastic result for us but the situation is not insurmountable and the players have done it before. We want the type of performances of two years ago.\" </p> <p>Of that there can be little doubt. On the way to winning the 1999 European Cup United came from two goals down to eliminate Juventus in Turin and in the final Bayern, needing only to hold their 1-0 lead for three minutes of stoppage time, were beaten 2-1. Then again United led 2-1 the last time they were in Munich only to be held to a 2-2 draw in the closing minute. They also have to contend with the tiresome statistic that in Europe Bayern have yet to lose a second leg at home after winning the first. </p> <p>Ferguson believes the opposition will waste little time seeking to put a semi-final place further beyond his reach. \"I think they'll try to beat us in the first 20 minutes,\" he said. \"I don't think we'll just be going for it. First of all we've got to make sure they don't score. Patience will be important.\" </p> <p>On arrival here yesterday the United party had to walk across disinfected mats, doing their bit to keep foot and mouth out of Bavaria. They will hope Bayern have feet of clay tonight ... but you wouldn't Effen bet on it. </p> <p> <strong> Bayern Munich</strong> (probable, 3-4-1-2): Kahn; Linke, Kuffour, Andersson; Sagnol, Jeremies, Effenberg, Tarnat; Scholl; Elber, Jancker. </p> <p><strong> Manchester United </strong> (probable, 4-4-2): Barthez; G Neville, Stam, Brown, Silvestre; Scholes, Keane, Butt, Giggs; Yorke, Cole.</p>",

      "bodyText": "So often does the average footballer consider such-and-such the icing on the cake it is tempting to believe that behind the bland pleasantries there is a pastry chef struggling to get out. For Manchester United the Champions League is the cake, and everything else so much marzipan. On Saturday United became only the fourth English team to complete a championship hat-trick and they have now won the Premiership in seven seasons out of nine. Yet their manager Sir Alex Ferguson has no doubt about the effect on Old Trafford's season should his side fail to overturn Bayern Munich's first-leg lead here this evening. \"It will definitely create a hell of a flatness,\" Ferguson said. \"Of course winning the Premier League is always important but if we are to progress Europe is the place to do it. That is why losing now would be a big disappointment.\" Ferguson is convinced United will score against Bayern this time. \"If we can get a goal it will be very interesting,\" he mused. \"In fact there's nothing else for it: we've got to score.\" A one-match suspension following his booking when Bayern won at Old Trafford will deprive United of David Beckham's superior services tonight. In his absence Ferguson is expected to persist with Paul Scholes on the right, though tucking in to allow Gary Neville to overlap and provide the crosses. Bayern have lost their two wing-backs, Hasan Salihamidzic and Bixente Lizarazu, to suspensions. Ferguson feels Ottmar Hitzfeld's likely replacements, Willy Sagnol and Michael Tarnat, \"are both experienced but without the energy and the quickness of the other two\". Ryan Giggs, on whom so much depends, will hope this is true. As much will rest on Roy Keane and Nicky Butt preventing Stefan Effenberg and Jens Jeremies gaining the sort of control of the second leg that they did in the first. Effenberg's was the long pass nodded square by Thomas Linke for a substitute, Paulo Sergio, to appear from nowhere and win that game in the 86th minute. \"Losing was very disappointing,\" Ferguson said. \"Nil-nil would have been a fantastic result for us but the situation is not insurmountable and the players have done it before. We want the type of performances of two years ago.\" Of that there can be little doubt. On the way to winning the 1999 European Cup United came from two goals down to eliminate Juventus in Turin and in the final Bayern, needing only to hold their 1-0 lead for three minutes of stoppage time, were beaten 2-1. Then again United led 2-1 the last time they were in Munich only to be held to a 2-2 draw in the closing minute. They also have to contend with the tiresome statistic that in Europe Bayern have yet to lose a second leg at home after winning the first. Ferguson believes the opposition will waste little time seeking to put a semi-final place further beyond his reach. \"I think they'll try to beat us in the first 20 minutes,\" he said. \"I don't think we'll just be going for it. First of all we've got to make sure they don't score. Patience will be important.\" On arrival here yesterday the United party had to walk across disinfected mats, doing their bit to keep foot and mouth out of Bavaria. They will hope Bayern have feet of clay tonight ... but you wouldn't Effen bet on it. Bayern Munich (probable, 3-4-1-2): Kahn; Linke, Kuffour, Andersson; Sagnol, Jeremies, Effenberg, Tarnat; Scholl; Elber, Jancker. Manchester United (probable, 4-4-2): Barthez; G Neville, Stam, Brown, Silvestre; Scholes, Keane, Butt, Giggs; Yorke, Cole.",

John McKenna, the club's first manager, provided the answer: Scotland. All eleven players of the Liverpool team that played its first-ever competitive match, against Higher Walton on September 3 1892, were Scottish.\"</p> <p>More recently, Liverpool famously fielded a non-English XI for the 1986 FA Cup final against Everton: Grobbelaar, Lawrenson, Beglin, Nicol, Whelan, Hansen, Dalglish, Johnston, Rush, M\u00f8lby and MacDonald came from behind to win 3-1.</p> <p>And if you want any further evidence that foreign can be fantastic, look at Chelsea.

Club secretary Tony Cuthbert told Guardian Unlimited: \"I've never heard of that before. And there's nothing in the football league regulations about it either.\"</p> <p><strong>HOOP NIGHTMARES</strong></p> <p><strong>\"Why do football teams tend to play in stripes whereas rugby teams play in hoops? Why do Celtic, then, play in hoops? What other teams break this trend?\"</strong> asks Richard Tonkin.</p> <p>Hoops make players look bigger. Stripes make players look taller. Being squat and bulky is a distinct advantage in rugby, a sport where having a neck wider than your head is de rigueur. But footballers like to look tall and slim, so stripes it is.</p> <p>Why Celtic chose green-and-white hoops as opposed to stripes nobody seems sure. They started life playing in all-white shirts, then changed to a vertical green-and-white-striped affair before \"evolving\" into the famous hoops in time for the 1903-4 season. Perhaps the team was just too tall and wispy for their own good.</p> <p>Of course, this is the final season the famous hoops will be seen at Celtic Park. The club's new strip has two white panels under each arm, breaking both hoop and supporters' hearts. A \"Hands off the Hoops\" campaign hopes to put a stop to this heresy, although as the new strip has already achieved \"higher sales than any other shirt\", this seems unlikely.</p> <p>But you'll still be able to see hoops elsewhere. Morton, Queen's Park Rangers and Reading play in blue-and-white hoops, Darlington and Queen's Park play in black-and-white hoops, while the Hamilton Accies play in red-and-white hoops. Sadly, if you still desire that Celtic aesthetic, you'll have to go to watch Rapid Vienna, Shamrock Rovers or Sporting Lisbon play.</p> <p><strong>BBC SPORT: ALL MANCHESTER UNITED SUPPORTERS?</strong></p> <p><strong>\"Are all the BBC's radio sports correspondents Manchester United fans?

All eleven players of the Liverpool team that played its first-ever competitive match, against Higher Walton on September 3 1892, were Scottish.\" More recently, Liverpool famously fielded a non-English XI for the 1986 FA Cup final against Everton: Grobbelaar, Lawrenson, Beglin, Nicol, Whelan, Hansen, Dalglish, Johnston, Rush, M\u00f8lby and MacDonald came from behind to win 3-1. And if you want any further evidence that foreign can be fantastic, look at Chelsea. On December 26 1999, they played Southampton with 11 overseas players - the first time an English league side had fielded a starting line-up without a single British player. With Graeme Le Saux injured, Chris Sutton suffering from flu, and Dennis Wise's wife due to give birth, Gianluca Vialli started with De Goey, Ferrar, Babayaro, Thome, Leboeuf, Petrescu, Poyet, Deschamps, Di Matteo, Flo and Ambrosetti. And the players did Vialli proud, with two first-half goals from Flo helping Chelsea to victory. ANOTHER PUB TALE PROVED WRONG \"Is it true that Notts County don't have to wear an away kit if they choose not to as they were the first football league team,\" asks Joe Coffey. \"I heard that they didn't on some TV programme once.\" According to Notts County, the story is hokum. Club secretary Tony Cuthbert told Guardian Unlimited: \"I've never heard of that before. And there's nothing in the football league regulations about it either.\" HOOP NIGHTMARES \"Why do football teams tend to play in stripes whereas rugby teams play in hoops? Why do Celtic, then, play in hoops? What other teams break this trend?\" asks Richard Tonkin. Hoops make players look bigger. Stripes make players look taller. Being squat and bulky is a distinct advantage in rugby, a sport where having a neck wider than your head is de rigueur. But footballers like to look tall and slim, so stripes it is. Why Celtic chose green-and-white hoops as opposed to stripes nobody seems sure. They started life playing in all-white shirts, then changed to a vertical green-and-white-striped affair before \"evolving\" into the famous hoops in time for the 1903-4 season. Perhaps the team was just too tall and wispy for their own good. Of course, this is the final season the famous hoops will be seen at Celtic Park. The club's new strip has two white panels under each arm, breaking both hoop and supporters' hearts. A \"Hands off the Hoops\" campaign hopes to put a stop to this heresy, although as the new strip has already achieved \"higher sales than any other shirt\", this seems unlikely. But you'll still be able to see hoops elsewhere. Morton, Queen's Park Rangers and Reading play in blue-and-white hoops, Darlington and Queen's Park play in black-and-white hoops, while the Hamilton Accies play in red-and-white hoops. Sadly, if you still desire that Celtic aesthetic, you'll have to go to watch Rapid Vienna, Shamrock Rovers or Sporting Lisbon play. BBC SPORT: ALL MANCHESTER UNITED SUPPORTERS? \"Are all the BBC's radio sports correspondents Manchester United fans? I know that Mark Chapman is on Radio 1 as is Fergus Sweeney on Radio 5, however as these are the only radio stations I listen to. I am at a loss as to whether the rest could be the same. Nonetheless with Greg Dyke in charge is there some sinister plot to redden the BBC or simply shared interests that guarantee promotion to top sports jobs?\" asks Andy Peacock. \"Does the man not pay attention?\" asks Steve Edgington. \"Adrian Chiles, a fantastic correspondent who covers the 606 programme amongst other BBC programmes, is a fan of the greatest club in the world. That's West Bromwich Albion, of course.\" CAN YOU HELP? \"Who was the first footballer ever to be sent off with the red card?\" asks R Richards. \"Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has a record at Manchester United of 76 goals in 202 appearances or one goal every 2.66 matches. Not bad at all, I think we can all agree. However, what I want to know is, bearing in mind how often he has been used as a substitute, how many goals does he score for every 90 minutes he is on the pitch? Does anyone else have a better ratio of goals per 90 minutes? And who has the best goals per 90 international minutes ratio? I am guessing it is Gerd Muller with 68 goals in 62 caps. His club record should also beat Solskjaer, I think, standing at 447 goals in 490 games. Can anyone else help?\" asks Benjamin Hardy. Email the.boss@theguardian.com if you know the answers.",

I'd somehow caught a terrible cold during the previous 24 hours, and it was rather embarrassing to arrive at a stranger's house with a continually dripping nose, and halfway through my stock of Malaysian loo roll. The cold was also giving me ear- and toothache, which meant I wasn't the brightest company. Margaret, whom I was staying with, was a treasure - feeding me up and administering Lemsip and TLC. One of the big delights of this trip has been the kindness and generosity of the people I have stayed with. When I get back I'll have to think of a way to repay all the friends who have 'lent' me their contacts abroad. </p> <p>On Sunday, Margaret and her sister Cynthia took me on a 'tiki tour' of the area - which basically means going where your fancy takes you. A picnic on the cliff above Kaiteriteri beach overlooking the Abel Tasman coast made me excited about going there the next day. Abel Tasman National Park is a stretch of the most beautiful coastline imaginable: lush forest, cliff-tops, golden sandy bays and a deep turquoise sea. The first afternoon I just walked along the trail for a couple of hours and back, glad to be giving my legs a stretch. I'm not sure whether it was my cold or the fact of sitting in a car for too long, but I was soon tired. Time to take the fortune teller's advice (see Sue's report, <a href=\"http://travel.theguardian.com/netjetters/sue/story/0,7452,435812,00.html\">week 11</a>) and eat some more fruit and vegetables - it's too easy to stop at a cafe and just snack on coffee and the delicious cakes they have in New Zealand. Mike from Wellington also gave me some chocolate from Whittakers, where he now works, and I'm addicted - it's really thick and chunky, and stuffed with nuts... mmm.</p> <p> The next day I caught a water taxi up the coast and walked about 10km to a different pick-up point. It was a lovely day - crashing through the waves in the boat was hard on the backside but great fun. I felt sorry for the kayakers who were caught in the wash. The walk in the bright sun shine was lovely, with occasional stops on the beach to read a couple of chapters of my book. A perfect day. In my usual panic about seeing as much as possible, I headed off that evening to the Nelson Lakes area. Taking a left earlier than I should, I travelled for miles down a pitch black road that every so often turned into a gravel track - I was very relieved to finally reach the hostel and fall into my bunk. A quick zoom round the beautiful Rototoui Lake the next day, and it was off to the west coast. </p> <p>I was driving through the mountainous Buller Gorge when I suddenly thought, \"what on earth am I doing rushing around like a blue-arsed fly?\" My original plan had been to go back to Auckland and then on to the North Islands, highly recommended by Susie in an email. I had already forgone the lovely Lakes area, so I decided at that moment that since I was here in the South Island I would take my time and do more 'tiki tours', even though that meant foregoing the North. It felt like a weight had been lifted from my shoulders and I immediately began stopping at all the lookout spots that took my fancy - and there were plenty of those. Sorry Susie - I'll have to come again to go to all the bits I will miss out. </p> <p>The west coast left me flabbergasted once again by the magnificence of the scenery. Huge rollers crashed against enormous craggy mountains. It has been impossible to take photographs of everything I've seen over the last couple of days - it's all too vast. I ended up deleting the ones that I did take because they couldn't do justice to what was before my eyes. </p> <p>Eventually, I reached the Pancake Rocks at Punakaiki. A process known as stylobedding - my geological knowledge is increasing - has layered these rocks into what look like stacks of pancakes. The sea has punched holes into them through which the waves crash and spumes of water shoot up - I spent a happy hour wandering around and watching the spectacle. I stopped at Hokitika for local fish and chips and a hostel bed before setting off for the Franz Josef glacier. </p> <p>After the lovely weather of the last week, the mist descended and the rain fell just when some sunshine was needed for the sights. I did a short walk to a glacier viewpoint but could see very little in the pouring rain. The hostel was a nightmare of smelly, wet clothing, with a bad-tempered queue for the washing machines and dryers. Yet despite all this, I managed to get up the following day and spend the most amazing morning on a helihike to the glacier in glorious sunshine. I am seriously beginning to think that someone is looking down on me, because my good fortune continues - the very helpful Guiding Company at the Alpine Adventure Centre squeezed me in on the morning trip. It was my first ever helicopter flight, and what a debut it was - being whisked up around Franz Josef glacier and then actually dropped off onto it. I'd been very nervous about hiking over the ice, but with the special boots and the guide making steps for us it was easier than I expected. Poor Bruce found it a bit of a struggle, as there weren't any boots to fit him. The ice has a blue tinge - here my geology fails - bright blue in the ice caves and crevasses. It was awesome on the glacier, and crawling through ice caves was yet again something I could never have imagined doing. The list of unforgettable experiences continues to grow. I am now feeling elated and tired - time to go for a late lunch before heading even further south. Happy Easter to everyone.</p>",

      "body": "<p> We caught the bus south to Zomba. This was the old colonial capital of Malawi and was completely different from the other towns we had been through. It was perched on the edge of a plateau surrounded by wooded hills, and there were wide paved streets lined with trees, and buildings more than two storeys high - the first we had seen outside Lilongwe.</p> <p>In the middle of town there was a small, quiet graveyard for the European settlers who had lived and died here in the early part of the 20th century. Each of the gravestones told a story: farmers from Devon dying of malaria, children taken by fevers, soldiers of the East Africa Regiment killed in world war one. Next to this there was another more recent graveyard for the local inhabitants. These gravestones told a very different tale. Life in Africa is still hard, but now the killer is more likely to be Aids. It's been forecast that across the continent over 30m people will die from the disease by 2020. In Malawi, HIV is horrifyingly prevalent. Some statistics say that over 50% of pregnant women are infected. The government is trying to tackle the problem - we saw plenty of posters advocating the use of condoms - but there is a long, long way to go.</p> <p>Leaving Zomba we headed north, back to the Lake.</p> <p>Lake Malawi forms part of the Great Rift Valley that splits east Africa. It's the third largest lake on the continent, 580km long and up to 700m deep. At it's southern end sits the small port of Monkey Bay.</p> <p>The journey had taken a few hours and we clambered out of the minibus, stretching our cramped muscles. We were immediately jumped on by 14-year-old Mark who offered to show us around - for a small fee, of course. Mark was very cheerful and, as we walked, kept up a running commentary about the town, pausing occasionally to shoo away other boys also keen to escort us.</p> <p>After dropping our rucksacks at the only resthouse, we took Mark to a local bar to have some food. We all had chambo (a fish found in the lake) and nsima (a sort of dumpling made from maize flour). Mark told us about school and his favourite subjects (business studies and history - he asked me when the great fire of London was, I'm ashamed to say I didn't know). Exams were coming up soon and he was a bit worried about how he was going to pass maths. As an orphan living with his older sister, he paid his way by escorting mzungus - chichewa for foreigners - like us. When I was 14, I spent most of my time watching TV.</p> <p>The next morning Mark was there to escort us down to the port (this one was on him). The Ilala is a large old steamship which was commissioned into service on the lake in 1951. She can carry up to 350 passengers and travels up and down the lake once a week stopping at about a dozen towns with exotic names like Chipoka, Usisya and Likoma Island.</p> <p>On board there were three classes: cabin, first class (you sleep on the deck) and economy (you're in the hold with two hundred other people and lots of chickens). As we were going to be on the boat for two days we had booked one of the cabins for about \u00a330 each. The cabins were certainly not the luxury option they had been once, but they were still in a reasonable condition and comfortable enough.</p> <p>We were due to sail at 08:00 but in fact didn't get going until nearly 11:00. This, apparently, was pretty punctual and there was a jolly mood amongst the passengers as we crowded onto the boat. Up on deck we met our fellow first class passengers - all mzungus who were too soft to travel economy. There was a sprinkling of Americans, a couple of Aussies and a Dutch girl. The Americans, Rusty, Russell and Jill, had their own boua board (a Malawian game that is an excellent way of passing time) so we immediately made friends with them. The skipper was also there and he introduced himself: Captain Adonis.</p> <p>Not long into the voyage, I began to feel ill. I had a fever, sore throat, pounding head and aching limbs. I stupidly hadn't brought a thermometer with me so I couldn't check my temperature, but clearly I had malaria, or perhaps yellow fever, or maybe typhoid. I spent most of the next two days asleep in the cabin feeling very sorry for myself.</p> <p>In spite of this, the Ilala made its stately way around the lake. At each stop there was great excitement, both on the ship and on shore where crowds lined the beaches. Fisherman paddled out in their canoes to sell the day's catch. The lifeboats were lowered and people precariously clambered aboard to be ferried ashore. Everyone else watched from the decks in the faint hope that someone might fall in.</p> <p>The Aussies and the Dutch contingent had opted for the deck and this proved to be a mistake. During one stop in the night, they woke to find themselves surrounded by interested local villagers who had been allowed on board to sightsee. The next night, a sudden squall left the deck rainswept and sent them scurrying to the shelter of our rooms. They gave up after that and paid the extra for a cabin.</p> <p>Late in the evening of the second day we arrived at our destination (Nkhata Bay, as recommended by Charlotte in her email) to find a power cut had blacked out the town. Pushing through the crowds on the jetty we grabbed a pick-up to take us to where we were staying. Njaya Lodge was also in darkness so we went straight to bed. I was still feeling ill and woke in the middle of the night, drenched in sweat. My hair was soaked, the sheets were damp but the next morning I felt absolutely fine. Not malaria then.</p> <p>Njaya is a lovely, relaxed place perched on a hillside sloping down to a quiet beach. The days have slipped by without us really seeming to do anything. Our $3-a-night reed hut overlooks the lake and in the morning we get up late and wander down to the beach for a dip. Our American friends from the Ilala, Rusty, Russell and Jill, are also staying here, and our evenings are spent playing pool and watching the fisherman paddle back in their dugout canoes as the sun set. We drink and eat lots.</p> <p>Occasionally, for a change of scenery we walk into town to have a drink and share a joke with the market traders who are much friendlier than the ones in Cape Maclear. There are some nice pieces on sale here and Rusty has bought so much that I am beginning to suspect he is planning an African theme park on his return to Michigan.</p> <p>He had the brilliant idea of bringing lots of old tee-shirts and trainers out with him to use as swaps. The traders are very keen on anything with a recognisable logo such as Nike or Addidas and will bring down their prices substantially. Rusty's negotiations resemble a bring-and-buy sale with him laying out his wares in front of the traders while they pore over them with a critical eye.</p> <p>My cheap Australian mirrored sunglasses also came in for a lot of attention and I have been offered numerous wood carvings and chieftain's chairs for them. Helen's expensive Diesel sunglasses, however, are bluntly ignored.</p> <p>Writing this report has been the most exhausting thing I've done all week - I'm going back to sleep on the beach now.</p>",

The Americans, Rusty, Russell and Jill, had their own boua board (a Malawian game that is an excellent way of passing time) so we immediately made friends with them. The skipper was also there and he introduced himself: Captain Adonis. Not long into the voyage, I began to feel ill. I had a fever, sore throat, pounding head and aching limbs. I stupidly hadn't brought a thermometer with me so I couldn't check my temperature, but clearly I had malaria, or perhaps yellow fever, or maybe typhoid. I spent most of the next two days asleep in the cabin feeling very sorry for myself. In spite of this, the Ilala made its stately way around the lake. At each stop there was great excitement, both on the ship and on shore where crowds lined the beaches. Fisherman paddled out in their canoes to sell the day's catch. The lifeboats were lowered and people precariously clambered aboard to be ferried ashore. Everyone else watched from the decks in the faint hope that someone might fall in. The Aussies and the Dutch contingent had opted for the deck and this proved to be a mistake. During one stop in the night, they woke to find themselves surrounded by interested local villagers who had been allowed on board to sightsee. The next night, a sudden squall left the deck rainswept and sent them scurrying to the shelter of our rooms. They gave up after that and paid the extra for a cabin. Late in the evening of the second day we arrived at our destination (Nkhata Bay, as recommended by Charlotte in her email) to find a power cut had blacked out the town. Pushing through the crowds on the jetty we grabbed a pick-up to take us to where we were staying. Njaya Lodge was also in darkness so we went straight to bed. I was still feeling ill and woke in the middle of the night, drenched in sweat. My hair was soaked, the sheets were damp but the next morning I felt absolutely fine. Not malaria then. Njaya is a lovely, relaxed place perched on a hillside sloping down to a quiet beach. The days have slipped by without us really seeming to do anything. Our $3-a-night reed hut overlooks the lake and in the morning we get up late and wander down to the beach for a dip. Our American friends from the Ilala, Rusty, Russell and Jill, are also staying here, and our evenings are spent playing pool and watching the fisherman paddle back in their dugout canoes as the sun set. We drink and eat lots. Occasionally, for a change of scenery we walk into town to have a drink and share a joke with the market traders who are much friendlier than the ones in Cape Maclear. There are some nice pieces on sale here and Rusty has bought so much that I am beginning to suspect he is planning an African theme park on his return to Michigan. He had the brilliant idea of bringing lots of old tee-shirts and trainers out with him to use as swaps. The traders are very keen on anything with a recognisable logo such as Nike or Addidas and will bring down their prices substantially. Rusty's negotiations resemble a bring-and-buy sale with him laying out his wares in front of the traders while they pore over them with a critical eye. My cheap Australian mirrored sunglasses also came in for a lot of attention and I have been offered numerous wood carvings and chieftain's chairs for them. Helen's expensive Diesel sunglasses, however, are bluntly ignored. Writing this report has been the most exhausting thing I've done all week - I'm going back to sleep on the beach now.",

      "body": "<p>Scientist Keith Ryden believes that solar flares in space could affect lives as Britain becomes increasingly reliant on satellites, and that British research is not keeping up with work to prevent that happening, because we have not yet grasped the risk.</p> <p>The end may be nigh, but not because of a comet crashing to earth as doomsayers of old used to say, according to Mr Ryden, principal scientist in the Space Department of the government's Defence Evaluation and Research Agency, who will be spreading his message to The Royal Aeronautical Society this evening.</p> <p>Sun flares create massive electromagnetic disruptions that flow outwards in waves across space, said Mr Ryden. Our understanding of the impact of these waves on satellites was largely theoretical, and based on work from the 60's, until a new series of European and American satellites were launched.</p> <p>\"Nasa and others have been positioning satellites four times further out than the moon, balanced in the gravity between the sun and the earth, and so relatively stable. We have seen clearly how disrupted they can be by solar flares,\" said Mr Ryden.</p> <p>And there is a potential impact on people's lives. In the past, only ship's navigational systems and surveillance depended on satellite reliability. Now, as guidance systems are brought into cars and general technology, the effect of a possible satellite glitch is magnified.</p> <p>Research into this area is advanced in Scandinavia, where the impact of solar disturbances are much more direct than in the UK. Magnetic disruption from space has actually affected the area's lengthy power grids.</p> <p>The United States has also taken solar flares very seriously. \"The US is well ahead of the UK. That's particularly because the US air force has seen how important it is for their defence plans,\" said Mr Ryden.</p> <p><strong>Useful link</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.spaceweather.com\" target=\"_new\">Spaceweather</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Scientist Keith Ryden believes that solar flares in space could affect lives as Britain becomes increasingly reliant on satellites, and that British research is not keeping up with work to prevent that happening, because we have not yet grasped the risk. The end may be nigh, but not because of a comet crashing to earth as doomsayers of old used to say, according to Mr Ryden, principal scientist in the Space Department of the government's Defence Evaluation and Research Agency, who will be spreading his message to The Royal Aeronautical Society this evening. Sun flares create massive electromagnetic disruptions that flow outwards in waves across space, said Mr Ryden. Our understanding of the impact of these waves on satellites was largely theoretical, and based on work from the 60's, until a new series of European and American satellites were launched. \"Nasa and others have been positioning satellites four times further out than the moon, balanced in the gravity between the sun and the earth, and so relatively stable. We have seen clearly how disrupted they can be by solar flares,\" said Mr Ryden. And there is a potential impact on people's lives. In the past, only ship's navigational systems and surveillance depended on satellite reliability. Now, as guidance systems are brought into cars and general technology, the effect of a possible satellite glitch is magnified. Research into this area is advanced in Scandinavia, where the impact of solar disturbances are much more direct than in the UK. Magnetic disruption from space has actually affected the area's lengthy power grids. The United States has also taken solar flares very seriously. \"The US is well ahead of the UK. That's particularly because the US air force has seen how important it is for their defence plans,\" said Mr Ryden. Useful link Spaceweather",

      "bodyText": "A split emerged last night between the world's big pharmaceutical companies over whether to proceed today with a patent rights lawsuit against the South African government that has turned into an international public relations disaster. Three of the world's largest pharmaceutical firms - Britain's GlaxoSmithKline, and Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb in the US - broke ranks with 36 other companies who are party to the attempt to overturn a South African law that permits the government to import generic and other cheaper drugs to deal with health emergencies or where patented medicines are too expensive. Last night the firms were negotiating with the South African government to reach a settlement before the Pretoria high court hearing resumes today after a six-week adjournment. At the weekend, Nelson Mandela joined widespread international condemnation of the pharmaceutical companies' lawsuit by denouncing it as \"a gross error\". \"They are exploiting the situation in the developing world, because they charge exorbitant prices,\" he said. \"This is completely wrong and must be condemned.\" But Mr Mandela also said that the case could be settled through negotiation and said the South African government must \"take responsibility for not doing sufficient work\". Sources close to the case said the breakaway drug companies were keen to withdraw from the lawsuit but were unable to see a way out without making concessions they are concerned could influence other countries following South Africa's lead. The firms are particularly worried that a legal precedent might be established, allowing governments to declare individual drugs as too expensive and patents to be overridden worldwide. If an agreement can be reached between South Africa and the three drugs manufacturers, it would exert enormous pressure on the other firms to pull out of the lawsuit and prove an important moral and legal victory for campaigners for wider access to anti-Aids drugs. But the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PMA), in whose name the legal challenge was filed, said it would continue the action even if only a handful of drug companies wanted to do so. None of the parties was willing to discuss the talks publicly, but an industry source said that Merck in particular had been deeply uncomfortable about the legal action for some time and was urgently looking for a way out. Last month, amid rising international criticism of the lawsuit against South Africa, the company said it would sell two anti-Aids drugs in the developing world without profit. GlaxoSmithKline distanced itself by using its South African subsidiary as a representative in the lawsuit and has also offered cheaper life-saving drugs to the developing world. Bristol-Myers Squib said it would not oppose generic production of its drugs in Africa, and offered to sell its anti-retrovirals for $1 each. Last night, the head of the PMA, Mirryena Deeb, said she could not discuss the legal case. The South African government is divided on the issue. While Thabo Mbeki and some of his ministers have portrayed the case as a legal crusade by the developing world against the exploitation of multinationals, there has been concern within the administration that it will deter foreign investors. But a health department spokeswoman, Jo-Anne Collinge, said the government would not abandon its central claim to the right to import generic and other cheaper drugs to deal with health emergencies or where prices are defined as unaffordable. \"Whatever the outcome, we expect to be able to implement this legislation,\" she said.",

It is the first new primetime role she has accepted since fronting Big Brother for Channel 4 and clinches her position as one of ITV's A-league stars. Every week members of the studio audience of Oblivious will \"discover\" they have been unwitting participants in the show. The show's makers will employ secret filming techniques to follow audience members in their everyday life during the weeks running up to transmission of each programme. Close friends and family may collude with the programme-makers and actors will also be employed to help create certain situations. The unwitting participants can win money without even knowing it by answering questions correctly or behaving in a certain way while they are being filmed. Once they get to the Oblivious studio and the secret filming is revealed by McCall, contestants get the chance to gamble the money they have already won and increase it. Oblivious is being made as a co-production between Mast Media and Tiger Aspect Productions, the company responsible for shows ranging from Gimme, Gimme, Gimme to Streetmate and Playing the Field. IT will be executive produced by Tiger Aspect head of entertainment Mark Linsey and produced by Barbara Lee. The Oblivious concept was created by Mast Media co-founders Mark Baker and Steve Havers, who will be acting as consultants to the show.

The interplay between valuing curiosity and the thorough acquisition of skills helped foster a mind of great creativity. She was also growing up at a time when anti-colonial radicalism and pro-worker politics inspired hope.</p> <p>From 1943 to 1945, Beryl attended Georgetown's teachers' training college, leaving with a first-class diploma. After graduation, she taught and lectured for the Unicef's nutrition programme.</p> <p>She always maintained that her decision to go for further study in England, rather than the United States, was decided by exchange rates rather than visions of Britain. Arriving in 1951, after initially facing problems in finding employment as a teacher, she taught from 1953-56 in Inner London Education Authority schools. It was a period recounted in her autobiographical Black Teacher (1976).</p> <p>The publisher softened her book, fearing for its sales, but it was a harsher account of the conditions of her mainly white, working-class pupils, and of the obstacles facing black teachers, than that of ER Braithwaite's To Sir With Love (1959). Braithwaite was one of the first post-war West Indian writers resident in London whom Beryl got to know.</p> <p>She also retained a special affection for the writer and editor Andrew Salkey. For a key period in the 1950s, Salkey was the writer-in-residence and main presenter in the BBC World Service's Caribbean section, and he was generous in his support of young, especially women, writers. Taking women seriously as writers - unless they were dead - was unusual among that group. At a conference to honour Salkey, held a few years before his death in 1995, she forcibly stressed that point.</p> <p>Her own creative writing for adults would be delayed for decades. She continued to add to her academic qualifications - and found people who shared her radical politics. The broad progressive alliances that she knew from Guyana she met again in England.</p> <p>Most importantly, in a personal sense, she found her English husband Patrick. With their loving marriage to support her, from 1959 to 1968 - when she rejoined the ILEA - she devoted her energies to bringing up her family, but managed to fit in writing textbooks and books for children.</p> <p>As the parent of \"mixed-race\" children - a curious term seeming to question the humanity of one parent - she encountered as much nonsense from the supposedly better-educated as she had in her working-class schools. Her own good sense and Patrick's support helped her remain unscathed.</p> <p>In 1968, she became deputy head and then head of Beckford primary school. Some of her experiences are in Black Teacher, but a sequel never appeared. In 1982, she joined London University's Institute of Education and the Ilea's Centre for Multicultural Education. This ended her direct involvement in schools but opened a new phase in her career, in which she applied her psychological knowledge to her teaching experience. Later, she got a doctorate in counselling psychology.</p> <p>The death of her husband in 1975 affected her and her children deeply, but she learnt from it. All this contributed to her understanding of children, which she passed on to friends and teachers, both in Britain and the US. The hideous politics of Guyana stopped her doing that work there. She was also a founder member of Camden Black Sisters.</p> <p>The mid-1980s marked a return to her abiding interest of writing. She showed herself once more an innovator.

Steadman And Joanna (1996) was the first of these; her most recent, the as-yet unpublished She Wore Silk, has as its central character a black woman involved in the Gordon Riots of 1780. Her qualities as a writer were more slowly appreciated by critics than readers.</p> <p>For her work in education and her writing, the Institute of Education made her a fellow, and the University of North London conferred an honorary doctorate.

What latter-day Book of Revelation have I stumbled across? It's a leaflet promoting a one-day conference on design and the creative industries, that's what. Talk about hyperbole.

They are calling it Superhumanism.</p> <p>Perhaps we shouldn't pick on this one event, organised by the Foreign Policy Centre. For the centre is only one of nearly a dozen London-based thinktanks which are equally culpable.

Many comprehensives got rid of them years ago, leaving pupils with nowhere to put their coats.

Instead of the old Victorian model, with classrooms arranged like assembly lines with pupils in serried rows, the school will acquire a new shape. The endless corridors will go; rooms will be in clusters not long lines. Kingsdale will slowly start looking like the real world, where people do not move around at once, in masses, but are able to move freely and at different times.

A former aid worker who cut her teeth in Mozambique and Zambia, Cottam is convinced that the best policy comes from the ground up. You have to speak to the people who use any service to find out what they really need: that's what she did with villagers in Africa and that's what she's doing here. Next she aims to do for prisons what she is doing for schools, and she's already got a \u00a340,000 grant from the Design Council to make it happen.

(School Works hope Kingsdale will eventually become a model repeated nationwide.) So many of the ideas dreamed up by thinktanks sound wonderful on paper, but fall at the hurdle of practicality: they could never be implemented. Equally, there are countless good, local innovations which are never replicated. Do-tankery might be a way to solve both problems at once.</p> <p>And, who knows, perhaps this brand of thoughtful, practical work will appeal to all those bright young things who leave college eager to change the world - and end up writing papers for the Fabian Society. Perhaps they might decide to become social entrepreneurs instead, giving up a year or two to work in a real-life project on the ground. There is a precedent. One of Bill Clinton's most popular initiatives was Americorps, his domestic version of John F Kennedy's peace corps, which enabled college leavers to give a year or two of \"national service\" - teaching in the inner city, helping the old or cleaning up the environment. It was a vote-winner for Clinton; maybe Tony Blair will want to propose a peace corps for Britain. Now that's an idea for the second term!

Apparently we have just \"one day to meet people's real needs, physical and emotional\". There are only \"nine hours to restore the population's faith\". What is this doomsday warning? What latter-day Book of Revelation have I stumbled across? It's a leaflet promoting a one-day conference on design and the creative industries, that's what. Talk about hyperbole. What will doubtless be a useful conference of academics, designers and business people has been oversold as an exercise in global redemption. They are calling it Superhumanism.

      "body": "<p>Italy has scored a victory in its battle to prise looted treasures from American and European museums. A 2nd century marble sculpture has been returned after a 45-year odyssey through the underworld art market.</p> <p>Police traced the bust of a victorious athlete, a copy of a 5th century BC original by the Greek sculptor Polykleitos, to the J Paul Getty museum in Malibu, California. Archaeologists hailed it as the vanguard of hundreds of stolen artifacts which would be reclaimed from public and private collections outside Italy.</p> <p>\"This is a beautiful piece of work and the best news we have had in years. We are very happy it has come home. Now we can pursue items in Paris, London and Munich,\" said Maria-Luisa Nava, of the culture ministry's archaeological department.</p> <p>Moves by Britain, Switzerland and the US to ban trade in looted antiquities have coincided with an Italian crackdown on tomb robbers. A multi-million pound black market in ransacking history is feeling the squeeze.</p> <p>The 10.2kg bust was copied from a Greek bronze statue of a young athlete fresh from triumph, possibly in the Olympics. It was unveiled last week in the former Roman colony of Venosa, deep in southern Italy, from which it disappeared in 1956 soon after excavation.</p> <p>The Getty, one of America's richest and most aggressive collectors, acquired it in 1996. The museum declined to tell Guardian Unlimited who was the seller.</p> <p>A brief statement said a decision was made to hand over the display after being alerted to its provenance by a specialist in Polykleitan sculpture. The museum's website made no reference to the bust or the handover.</p> <p>Sources from the police unit dedicated to protecting Italy's heritage claimed it took hard bargaining to persuade the Getty. The head of the unit, General Roberto Conforti, attended the unveiling.</p> <p>Archaeologists welcomed the transfer as the first major success of a January bilateral agreement between Italy and the US to make restitution quicker and easier.</p> <p>\"We know of hundreds of artifacts in the Louvre, in the British Museum, in Germany, Denmark and America, that we want back. It is rather delicate and will require lots of diplomacy but we're confident,\" said Dr Nava.</p> <p>Britain opened the door last month when Alan Howarth, the arts minister, said the government would sign a United Nations convention banning illicit trade in cultural property.</p> <p>Interpol implicated Britain's art market, the second largest in the world, in trafficking stolen antiquities. Switzerland is drafting legislation which could end its status as Europe's key transit point for smugglers later this year.</p> <p>\"These initiatives could put a real dampener on the trade. Take out America, Britain and Switzerland and the market is squeezed. Nobody will be able to buy the stuff,\" said Neil Brodie, head of the McDonald Institute's illicit antiquities' research centre.</p> <p>A new front against tomb robbers has been established in Palestrina, south of Rome, with Italy's first exhibition of recovered stolen artifacts, titled Wounded Archaeology. The aim was to convince the public that so-called tombaroli were not amateur archaeologists but criminals who destroyed heritage for profit, said organiser Sandra Gatti.</p> <p>Items secretly excavated were stripped of context and could no longer tell a story, said Dr Gatti.

      "bodyText": "Italy has scored a victory in its battle to prise looted treasures from American and European museums. A 2nd century marble sculpture has been returned after a 45-year odyssey through the underworld art market. Police traced the bust of a victorious athlete, a copy of a 5th century BC original by the Greek sculptor Polykleitos, to the J Paul Getty museum in Malibu, California. Archaeologists hailed it as the vanguard of hundreds of stolen artifacts which would be reclaimed from public and private collections outside Italy. \"This is a beautiful piece of work and the best news we have had in years. We are very happy it has come home. Now we can pursue items in Paris, London and Munich,\" said Maria-Luisa Nava, of the culture ministry's archaeological department. Moves by Britain, Switzerland and the US to ban trade in looted antiquities have coincided with an Italian crackdown on tomb robbers. A multi-million pound black market in ransacking history is feeling the squeeze. The 10.2kg bust was copied from a Greek bronze statue of a young athlete fresh from triumph, possibly in the Olympics. It was unveiled last week in the former Roman colony of Venosa, deep in southern Italy, from which it disappeared in 1956 soon after excavation. The Getty, one of America's richest and most aggressive collectors, acquired it in 1996. The museum declined to tell Guardian Unlimited who was the seller. A brief statement said a decision was made to hand over the display after being alerted to its provenance by a specialist in Polykleitan sculpture. The museum's website made no reference to the bust or the handover. Sources from the police unit dedicated to protecting Italy's heritage claimed it took hard bargaining to persuade the Getty. The head of the unit, General Roberto Conforti, attended the unveiling. Archaeologists welcomed the transfer as the first major success of a January bilateral agreement between Italy and the US to make restitution quicker and easier. \"We know of hundreds of artifacts in the Louvre, in the British Museum, in Germany, Denmark and America, that we want back. It is rather delicate and will require lots of diplomacy but we're confident,\" said Dr Nava. Britain opened the door last month when Alan Howarth, the arts minister, said the government would sign a United Nations convention banning illicit trade in cultural property. Interpol implicated Britain's art market, the second largest in the world, in trafficking stolen antiquities. Switzerland is drafting legislation which could end its status as Europe's key transit point for smugglers later this year. \"These initiatives could put a real dampener on the trade. Take out America, Britain and Switzerland and the market is squeezed. Nobody will be able to buy the stuff,\" said Neil Brodie, head of the McDonald Institute's illicit antiquities' research centre. A new front against tomb robbers has been established in Palestrina, south of Rome, with Italy's first exhibition of recovered stolen artifacts, titled Wounded Archaeology. The aim was to convince the public that so-called tombaroli were not amateur archaeologists but criminals who destroyed heritage for profit, said organiser Sandra Gatti. Items secretly excavated were stripped of context and could no longer tell a story, said Dr Gatti. Tourists and schoolchildren yesterday gaped at fragments of Etruscan, Sabine and Roman civilisation displayed in the archaeological museum, adorned with statistics of rising police seizures. Recovered artifacts from a 3rd century BC necropolis in Colombella revealed a ruling elite which flaunted wealth by stashing their tombs with bronze mirrors, vases and necklaces. Inscriptions and designs showed some princes were freed slaves who became merchants, suggesting an upwardly mobile, relatively democratic society. Pride of place went to a 460BC ceramic cup adorned with a satyr warrior. Stolen in 1994, a German Mercedes executive bought it the following year for \u00a332,000 at a Sotheby's auction.

Sylvester Stallone is boosting his presence on the web by launching what is described as the \"biggest Sly multimedia site in the world\". The Rambo star's new website, whose unveiling has been scheduled to coincide with the American cinema release of his new movie Driven on 27 April, will feature sound clips as well as interviews with the man himself. Stallone World, who are set to launch the site, say: \"The site will offer sound clips from every Sly movie, even from the rare movies like Capone, Lovers and Other Strangers, Rebel and A Man Called Rainbo.\"",

The order opened Our Lady of Victory, its only British centre, in the 1960s. The clinic offers \"therapy in a spiritual context\". </p> <p>It is believed that up to 30 residents stay there, usually for a year to 18 months. They tend to be referred by their bishops or other senior clergy. </p> <p>Michael Hill, the priest jailed for five years in 1997 for indecent assaults on children, was once there but left after three months. He was appointed chaplain at Gatwick in the 1980s by Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, now Archbishop of Westminster but then bishop of Arundel and Brighton, despite complaints that he had been a risk to children. </p> <p>The centre has attracted criticism. An assistant priest who spent a week there after it was discovered that he was a practising homosexual compared it to \"purgatory\" complaining of the \"gross invasion of privacy, the lack of freedom of movement and the oppressive, claustrophobic atmosphere\". </p> <p>It hit the headlines in 1993 when Father Sean Seddon, 38, was sent there after a six-year affair with a teacher. On learning his lover had lost their baby, he threw himself under a train. </p> <p>Institutions such as Our Lady of Victory are apparently becoming less popular. The tendency is for priests to be treated in secular organisations. </p> <p>Yesterday nobody at the centre was available for comment. </p> <p><strong>Sex attacks</strong></p> <p>Between 1995 and 1999, 21 Catholic priests were convicted of sexual offences against children.

The clinic, often referred to as Stroud, is run by an American order, the Servants of the Paraclete, established in New Mexico in the 1940s. The order opened Our Lady of Victory, its only British centre, in the 1960s. The clinic offers \"therapy in a spiritual context\". It is believed that up to 30 residents stay there, usually for a year to 18 months. They tend to be referred by their bishops or other senior clergy. Michael Hill, the priest jailed for five years in 1997 for indecent assaults on children, was once there but left after three months. He was appointed chaplain at Gatwick in the 1980s by Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, now Archbishop of Westminster but then bishop of Arundel and Brighton, despite complaints that he had been a risk to children. The centre has attracted criticism. An assistant priest who spent a week there after it was discovered that he was a practising homosexual compared it to \"purgatory\" complaining of the \"gross invasion of privacy, the lack of freedom of movement and the oppressive, claustrophobic atmosphere\". It hit the headlines in 1993 when Father Sean Seddon, 38, was sent there after a six-year affair with a teacher. On learning his lover had lost their baby, he threw himself under a train. Institutions such as Our Lady of Victory are apparently becoming less popular. The tendency is for priests to be treated in secular organisations. Yesterday nobody at the centre was available for comment. Sex attacks Between 1995 and 1999, 21 Catholic priests were convicted of sexual offences against children. Reported sex cases include: \u0095 1996: Durham priest Adrian McLeish jailed for six years after admitting 12 charges of child abuse \u0095 1997: Michael Hill, a former Gatwick chaplain, jailed for five years for indecent assault and gross indecency over a 19-year period \u0095 1998: Eric Taylor jailed for seven years for abusing boys in his care at the Father Hudson Society's home in Warwickshire, between 1957 and 1965 \u0095 1998: John Lloyd , press officer to the Archbishop of Cardiff, jailed for eight years for indecent assaults against children \u0095 2000: Joe Jordan , a Cardiff priest, jailed for eight years for sexually abusing boys \u0095 2000: Investigation at a leading Catholic school, the London Oratory . Pupils alleged they were abused by David Martin , a priest who died of a suspected Aids-related illness in 1998 \u0095 2000: Robert Deadman , a Cistercian monk who offered spiritual healing to women, convicted of indecently assaulting four women. The jury heard he carried out attacks in the confessional \u0095 2001: Allegations of torture, beatings and sexual molestation at St Ninian's school in Stirlingshire",

      "bodyText": "One of Britain's highest ranking ethnic minority police officers yesterday launched a claim of racial discrimination against the Metropolitan police. Superintendent Ali Dizaei, 39, has been suspended since January over allegations of wrongdoing brought by the force, including sex with prostitutes and corruption. The discrimination claim is the latest development in an increasingly bitter battle between the Iranian-born officer and the Met, which has been under fire for its record on race after the Stephen Lawrence inquiry branded it \"institutionally racist\". The Guardian has learned details of two new allegations served by the Met last week against the officer. They allege Mr Dizaei received a gratuity of two tickets to a social event at a London hotel, and that after an Iranian music concert Mr Dizaei drafted a letter for the organisers praising his role in policing the event which was sent to the Met commissioner. Supporters of the officer expect him to be questioned under caution about the allegations this month, following a massive investigation believed to have cost \u00a31m and involved phone taps and covert surveillance. He is yet to be charged with any criminal or disciplinary offences. In his employment tribunal claim, Mr Dizaei says the Met discriminated against and victimised him because of his race and because of his work for the black police association for which he was the legal adviser. Sadiq Khan, solicitor for the suspended officer, said Mr Dizaei had been recommended by Sir Paul Condon, the former Met commissioner and by a national selection board to be fit to be promoted to chief officer level. But a Met selection board rejected him for interview for a lesser job of chief superintendent. According to his application lodged with the employment tribunal, Mr Dizaei claims the decision to investigate and then suspend him was linked to his previous complaints to superior officers that he had been racially discriminated against: \"The respondent's officers decided to victimise the applicant for his considering that the treatment that he had received was on the grounds of his race by 'throwing the book at him' by seeking to dig up any possible complaint that might be made and to investigate it.\" Ravi Chand, chair of the national black police association, said: \"It is becoming increasingly evident that black and Asian members of the police service do not have any trust or confidence in internal complaints procedures. \"There is overwhelming evidence of the unfair treatment of Supt Dizaei. Taking the Metropolitan police to tribunal is the only way [he] can seek justice from a service riddled with senior officers who have become 'the untouchables' when it comes to accountability.\" Senior officers at Scotland Yard have rubbished claims that they are conducting a racist witch hunt against Mr Dizaei, describing his conduct before suspension as \"absolutely horrendous\". It was a ruling by an employment tribunal that came to the rescue of Sgt Gurpal Virdi, who was found guilty by a Met disciplinary panel of sending racist hatemail to himself and others. The force agreed to pay compensation after an employment tribunal found that the force had racially discriminated against Mr Virdi.",

At least one of three men bailed in connection with violent disorder is understood to have been with the young men whose behaviour started a pub fight which spilled out into the street and led to an attack on an Asian takeaway. But detectives have found no evidence yet to back claims that the group - mostly white but including Afro-Caribbeans and Asians - had pre-planned an incident in the Lidget Green area to cause the sort of violent \"revenge reaction\" by Asian youths which saw eight cars torched and three pubs severely damaged. Detective Superintendent Phil Sedgwick, head of the investigation, said: \"Racist behaviour does play a part in this investigation, but several separate things went on. We are looking at the behaviour of all groups, not just one.\" Further arrests are expected after a thorough study of video film taken by officers during the incident - a tactic not used during the \u00a31m Manningham violence in Bradford in 1995. On this occasion damage amounting to several hundred thousand pounds was done to businesses owned by whites, Muslims and Hindus. Most of the burnt out cars belonged to guests at the Hindu engagement party. Indian and white guests of Jyoti Narbheran and her fiance, Gareth Williams, had to crouch inside the Coach House pub when fighting started in the bar and windows were smashed. A woman motorist was yesterday still in Bradford royal infirmary with a serious eye injury after a stone smashed through her car windscreen as she drove past. Like other victims of the clash, including the party guests from London and Leicester, she was not from Bradford. Seven other people are recovering from cuts, bruises and shock, and two pubs, the Coach House and the Second West, where 60 customers huddled in an upstairs room as the building was showered with stones and set on fire, will be closed for months. The Lidget Green area returned to its usual calm overnight, although extra police were prominent and five fire engines were kept on standby. The three bailed men, a 32-year-old white, a 19-year-old Asian and a \"dark European\" aged 42, are expected to face further questioning. Civic leaders in Bradford called for a thorough investigation of the rapid train of events that saw the fight escalate. Several warned of increasing \"ghettoisation\" in the city. The development of ghettos was the theme of an interim report three months ago by the Bradford district race review panel. Led by Sir Herman Ouseley, former head of the commission for racial equality, it warned that the city was becoming split on racial and religious lines. Although Bradford has a generally good reputation for community relations, and plenty of ethnic minority business leaders and councillors, the panel warned that young people from all groups were mixing less. One of the city's most prominent Hindu businessmen, Hasmukh Shah, was a victim of the Lidget Green violence. His chemist shop in Horton Grane Road was looted by Asian youths.

But enough about Real Madrid v Galatasaray already - let's divert our Saxon-centric blue eyes towards Bayern Munich v Manchester United instead. Today, both teams went into their over-hyped clash (what's the betting it scores at least seven on the Liverpool-away-from-home-dull-o-meter?) making strangely unconfident noises. Jaap Stam expressed doubts for chrissakes, while - even more bizarrely - it was all quiet on the Giovane Elber front! In fact the only startling news was that Peter Schmeichel - on today of all days! - decided to make a pitch for the Imperial Lord Ferg's job.</p> <p>\"I would like to have that job,\" Schmeichel monotoned, before pulling out an Uzi and blasting John Connor to kingdom come. \"I would like to go into management at a later stage in my life and obviously I have always set myself targets. That is the biggest job in football so that is the one I am going to go after.\" But the good news for United fans - and anyone else really - is that Schmeichel doesn't want the position just yet. \"I wouldn't like to be anywhere near that job for the first 10 or 15 years,\" he added, unveiling a distinctly long-term management masterplan.</p> <p>Meanwhile, back in Bavaria, the news is that Elber has recovered from injury and will play for Bayern, while United are expected to replace the suspended David Beckham with Nicky Butt, moving Paul Scholes out to the right. But Jaap Stam is sounding more uncertain by the minute. \"I can tell you that since we arrived in Munich, confidence is running high inside the United camp,\" he confessed. But then the St John's Wort wore off, and the doubts crept back in. \"But to be honest, if we go out to Bayern our title party won't be as big as it could have been. We can't contemplate going out now. It would be so sad to do so.\" Indeed it would, Jaap. Indeed it would.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>PEP PLC</strong></p> <p>Welcome to Pep Guardiola Inc. A recently formed start-up, this small company hopes to head into profit within the next six months and then, within six months of that, wind the company up and buy half of the South Pacific. The business plan is not over-complicated and, as far as we can see, has two distinct points. (1) To arrange Pep a loads-a-money transfer from Barcelona to a Serie A side; and (2) Before that deal is completed, shove it under the noses of a few Premiership clubs, and get them to fork out even more.</p> <p>A masterstroke, we're sure you'll agree. The initiative was announced this morning by the Gazzetta dello Sport (like Teamtalk in Italian, and occasionally truer). They claimed that pretty-boy Pep has signed a pre-contract agreement on a four-year deal with Parma, currently fourth in Serie A. However, according to the report, Pep has insisted on two conditions. Firstly that Pep would only join if they qualify for one of Italy's four Big Cup places. Secondly, Pep would be able to reject the deal at any point if a more lucrative offer arrived from a Premiership team. </p> <p>Which may suggest that foreign players don't just come to England out of love for the food, weather and transport infrastructure. But it may also be a warning to Premiership managers who can't keep their hands out of other people's pockets. Managers like Gerard Houllier, maybe, who revealed his love for Pep today. \"Guardiola is a player I respect and admire,\" said the bonkers Frenchman, visibly excited at the prospect of signing his 14th defensive midfielder. \"We are interested in any good player if they can strengthen our squad, and you can write that,\" he went on, to the disappointment of the town criers in the audience.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"I'm disappointed I won't be facing Patrick in the semi-final.

So it's no surprise to see the likes of Arsene Wenger holding his head in his hands, Lee Dixon stomping around with a gob on, and Tony Adams going out on a 16-novel bender. Luckily, one of the more sensible lads is keeping his head: step forward level-headed Patrick Vieira, and tell us where it all went wrong.</p> <p>\"I feel very disappointed to have gone out to Valencia because I believe we have looked a better team than them,\" Pat told French newspaper Le Parisien. \"But we do need more players in the squad.

Information is sketchy but Reuters report that gunfire was heard in the streets around the radio station before the announcement. A group calling itself the Young Patriots has claimed to be behind the coup. \"The government which is killing people is over and the government of Buyoya is over now,\" state radio said. President Pierre Buyoya, an ethnic Tutsi soldier who has led the country since 1996, is currently attending peace talks with the Hutu rebel leader, Jean-Bosco Ndayikengurukiye, in neighbouring Gabon. Since 1993, more than 200,000 people have been killed in the civil war. Mr Buyoya himself took power in a coup in July 1996, promising to end the civil war. He signed a power-sharing agreement last August with Hutu opposition leaders. But the talks, mediated by the former South African president, Nelson Mandela, did not include the Hutu rebels. There are 17 political parties participating in the current negotiations, 10 Tutsi and 7 Hutu. Tutsi hardliners have opposed any talks with the rebels and rumours of a coup have been rampant since Mr Buyoya signed the power-sharing agreement last August in Arusha,Tanzania. Tutsis have controlled Burundi's army and economy since independence from Belgium in 1962. They have also controlled the government for all but four months of the country's history.

Next come the first division dreads: finding them buying Hear'Say records (what is that apostrophe for?), or dressing like H from Steps. Bookable offences, both. And then there is the second division: supporting a second division football team. Especially a second division football team whose home ground is 200 miles from your son's home ground in Norwich. Especially if this second (old third) division team is Stoke City. </p> <p>It's possible that there's a worse professional football team to support, but I doubt there is. At Stoke, they excel in the art of underachievement. One of the founding members of the football league, they've won a major title (if you can call the League Cup major) once in their entire history. </p> <p>I've carefully monitored Jack's drug habits (an addiction to Ribena and a strange, new, Italian-sounding supersweet) and his internet usage (exclusively skateboarding sites), and, to his credit, he laughed his head off at Popstars, but I was completely unprepared for the red-card offence which he was about to commit - and ashamed that it happened with help from his dad. </p> <p>I own up: I started it. I took him to Stoke's new Britannia Stadium for the Worthington Cup game against Liverpool. It was the first match we went to this season, just making the kick off after the 200 miles, racing from the new Britannia wasteland car park to the new ground past the new municipal incinerator. We watched (Jack watched; I cried into my shirt) the worst home defeat Stoke has suffered in 137 years. </p> <p>It might have put some boys off. Not Jack. While I was sulking in the club shop at the end of the game, Jack made an astonishing request: \"I want the away strip, dad, it's lush, isn't it?\" </p> <p>\"Well,\" I said, drying my eyes, \"It's an unusual shade of purple, I suppose.\" </p> <p>What logic might he be employing here, I was thinking - that they must play better when they play away? </p> <p>Perhaps it was the effect of the dye they put in the mushy peas; or the way the scoreboard refused to give up (even though the Stoke players clearly had), displaying 9-0, when everyone in the crowd knew it should have been only eight. (Liverpool just walked the goals in, and they didn't even bother playing Heskey or Owen.) Whatever effect the Britannia Stadium had on Jack, it was the exact opposite to the effect it had on me. </p> <p>A long time ago, when we played at the old Victoria Ground, we used to be good. I lived my first 18 years in Stoke: my blood runs in red and white stripes; I support Stoke City despite everything they haven't managed to achieve since I was less than Jack's age, despite the disappointments and the interminable prayers to St Jude to get them in the play-offs. Not automatic promotion, you understand, just the play-offs. Never in my wildest dreams (the ones where I score the winner in the FA Cup Final, for Stoke) did I think it would happen to my own son. I pleaded. </p> <p>\"Jack, you're young. You've got your whole life ahead of you. Think about your future. Think about your children's future. Oh, if only that one had been put to me. Don't do it, my son. Just don't do it.\" </p> <p>In fact, this isn't the worst of it: Jack's mate, Other Jack, has been to a game with us (1-1 vs Port Vale) and now he is a supporter, too. I've corrupted a complete innocent who doesn't even belong to me. It's all my fault. Well, mine and Tom Jones's. Delilah is the song we Stoke fans sing to cheer ourselves up, and to celebrate goals (so it's more or less exclusively used for cheering ourselves up): \"She stood there laughing ...\" It's either that or crying, isn't it? Which is something I do plenty of. </p> <p>I tried discouraging them, believe me, with my head in my hands, weeping. But it's too late, they've gone public - owned up to it in the playground back in Norwich, and they're unmoved by the taunting. Their decision is irreversible (for the time being, anyway). At least they can't be accused of \"glory hunting\", the insult they throw back at the Norwich- born Man U- or Arsenal-following taunters. That they're the new anti-glory hunters, that they've got their own cult, is the only comfort I can find in this unfortunate situation. </p> <p>\"Listen, don't do it for me. I can manage on my own, honest,\" I said. But they started discussing how they were now true Stoke supporters as we drove away. How Stoke was their team. </p> <p>\"It's a lifetime's misery you're looking at here. You do understand that, don't you?\" </p> <p>\"Yeah, dad, but Norwich are crap.\" </p> <p>\"Well, yes, son - but Stoke are worse.\" </p> <p>Yeah, Steve, but Stoke have a great crowd, said Other Jack. They never stop singing, do they? </p> <p>\"They?\" I said. </p> <p>\"We, we mean we ,\" they replied. </p> <p>And they sat in the back of the car, wearing their purple away shirts, trailing their new scarves from the windows, chorusing, \"Why why why Delilah, da-dah da-dah da-dah da-da-da ... \" </p> <p>\"And they have the best peas and chips, dad.\" </p> <p>The best peas and chips, I knew it.

Problems develop where one person isn't really willing to do that and the other person perceives that lack of willingness as an attack. When there are children in the family and there are different views about how to bring the children up in terms of religion, it can also cause problems. Verdict: Yes Zia Ramzan Spokesman for the Muslim Directory The stress and strain of modern life is difficult to handle at the best of times, coupled with a relentless onslaught against the institution of marriage and a disregard for the valid role of religious beliefs in this institution. Ted Turner and Jane Fonda are unfortunately a sign of the times: they show that it can be difficult to sustain a long-term relationship without common religious values. Although Islam encourages inter-racial marriages and, in certain cases, accepts inter-religious marriages, the latter is discouraged to avoid the same problems experienced by Turner and Fonda. Verdict: No",

      "body": "<p>\"There was a point where I really felt I had 'penniless divorcee lone parent' tattooed on my head,\" remarks JK Rowling sardonically. \"You couldn't read about Harry Potter without seeing that somewhere in the piece. </p> <p>\"So I thought, 'Fine, let's take that and use it.' \" </p> <p>\"Using it\" meant sacrificing the relative anonymity that Jo Rowling still enjoyed before she decided last year to lend her support to the National Council for One-Parent Families. The origin of \"JK\" goes back to the advice from her publisher Bloomsbury that the adventures of an 11-year-old boy who goes to wizard school would not appeal to 11-year-old boys if written too identifiably by a woman. </p> <p>Ironically, the initials provided a kind of anonymity and mystique, behind which Rowling was able to guard her privacy. Beyond the fact that she was a young-ish single mother who had written parts of the first book sitting in a cafe in Edinburgh because her flat was unheated, relatively little was known. Only when the third book (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban) was published did the media's curiosity force her hand: \"So I decided that I would give interviews - when I had something to say.\" </p> <p>She has plenty to say about the way single parents get blamed for everything from falling morals to rising crime: \"It's this universal human desire we have through history: if we demonise them, we don't have to help them. It's much easier for certain sections of society to say, 'You've brought this on yourself by your fecklessness; you sort it out,' than to say, 'You've been a victim of circumstances,' or 'Hey, marriages break up ... but how are we going to help you help yourself?' </p> <p>\"I never set out to be a lone parent - and there I was,\" she says. \"It's undeniable: there's a stigma attached. But I was the most unashamed lone parent you were ever going to meet. I was, like, 'And what is your problem? I'm doing a great job.' I'm very impatient with the idea that any of us should be ashamed about it.\" </p> <p>Rowling became a single parent when her marriage to Portuguese television journalist Jorge Arantes fell apart shortly after the birth of her daughter Jessica. \"It was my Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee moment,\" she jokes. \"It is the most humiliating thing, actually: you're supposed to have your relationship disaster in your teens, aren't you - and then wise up?\" </p> <p>Rowling left Portugal in early 1994 and came to Edinburgh, planning to stay with her sister Di for a few weeks until she found her feet. She never left. \"Edinburgh is beautiful,\" she explains, \"has good public transport and did have, then, free museums, and I thought, 'I'll have a much better life here on a low income with my daughter.' I could just see that broke single-parenthood here would be easier.\" </p> <p>\"Poverty is the issue,\" she continues. \"I do say that partly out of my own experience, but I am acutely aware when I talk about single parents being poor that, for me, it was a temporary state and it was always likely to be. We were never going to be rich if I had been a teacher, but we were never going to be dirt poor. And I had middle-class friends who could lend me a tenner.\" </p> <p>Rowling's success as an author - the four Harry Potter books to date have sold more than 90m copies worldwide and been translated into 42 languages - has clearly removed that problem. The days of sitting in a cafe, snatching a few hours to write while Jessica slept in her pushchair, are long gone. Jessica, now seven, goes to school, and has a nanny who picks her up two days a week, while Rowling looks after her the other three. </p> <p>\"She's embarrassingly precocious and gloats about the places she's been,\" she says. \"I heard her saying: 'I went to the Space Needle in Seattle, but Mummy couldn't go; Mummy was in a bookshop.' I'm like: 'Yeah, cheers, I know.' \" </p> <p>So does money solve all the problems of being a single parent? \"No, but it sure as hell helps. The worst of being a single parent is constantly thinking, 'I can't give you what I want to give you.' \" </p> <p>Rowling named her daughter after Jessica Mitford, sister of Nancy, author and avowed communist, whose autobiography Rowling read as a teenager. \"Basically, [Mitford] had every single possible component you could want as a 13-year-old leftwinger.\" </p> <p>Rowling looks an unlikely rebel. She was head girl of her comprehensive school in Chepstow - but she was the sort, she says, who got \"caught smoking at bus stops with boys in leather jackets\". Now 35, she is slim and chic in fitted black rollneck and charcoal hipster pants that flare from the knee. She shakes her head now and then to clear the blonde fringe from her vision - a mannerism that gives her an air of diffidence. But when she fixes you with her blue-grey eyes, you don't doubt that here is a person with some steel. </p> <p>\"It's a funny thing,\" she muses, \"but I doubt very much there would have been a Jessie if mum hadn't died when she did. I only went abroad nine months after she died: I really needed to get away. A lot of bad stuff had happened, and I needed to sort myself out a bit. And obviously, I met my ex-husband and Jessica was the result, so life does go on. </p> <p>\"It was doing a big rebound job, really,\" she adds. \"That's when you're most vulnerable.\" </p> <p>Her mother Anne had died in 1990 from multiple sclerosis at the age of 45. With just 20 years between them, Jo and her mother had been very close. \"Because I was the older child, to me she was almost like an older sister. I was never in any doubt that she was my mum, but that kind of relationship was there. I could talk to her a lot more freely than some of my friends spoke to their mothers.\" </p> <p>Anne Rowling had been 35 when first diagnosed with the illness - \"the same age as me now, which is a bit of a facer, isn't it?\" Because of the experience of losing her mother, Rowling has recently embraced the MS Society in Scotland and will be helping to publicise MS awareness week shortly. Anne had been a wheelchair user since Jo graduated from Exeter University, but the end, when it came, still seemed sudden. </p> <p>\"The last time I saw her before she died, I went back for Christmas,\" she recalls, haltingly. \"I can't believe in retrospect that I didn't really realise what was about to happen because she was so ill. Her mobility was very limited; she looked ill, very ill - which I'd never really seen before. She was absolutely exhausted. </p> <p>\"She died at home, of respiratory failure. Dad went upstairs and found her dead.\" </p> <p>Part of the appeal of the Harry Potter stories is the way Rowling's fiction engages with the dark stuff. Rowling began work on the first book just six months before her mother died. It is one of those well-known facts that the idea of Harry's world first came to Rowling on a train journey to King's Cross; but it was also on a train from that station that her mother and father first met. \"That's obviously why it looms large in my psyche,\" she comments wryly. </p> <p>Her mother's death, she says, made the fact that Harry is an orphan and the theme of death and loss \"immeasurably more important\", and she alludes to the now famous episode in chapter 12 of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, when Harry sees his dead parents in the Mirror of Erised (Desire backwards). What, I wonder, would Rowling see in the mirror? </p> <p>\"It would be my mother,\" she says without hesitation. \"You'd want five minutes to say, 'I have a daughter, and she's called Jessica, and she looks like this and she likes this, and I wrote some books - and Mum, guess what happened?' </p> <p>\"I'd gabble on and at the end of five minutes I'd realise I hadn't asked what it's like to be dead. It's the selfishness of the child, isn't it? - at least I'm aware of that. But it couldn't be long enough. That was all in that mirror episode, I think: recognising that it's just not healthy, not good for you to dwell and dwell and dwell. </p> <p>\"It's not about forgetting, but you have got to move on.\" </p> <p>\u0095 This is an edited version of an article that appears in the May issue of In Style, on sale from Friday.</p>",

In the end, I felt bad that money was splitting us up, so even though she was keeping it, I asked her round ... \" He finishes his drink, sucking noisily on the straw. \"I remember it!\" he says. \"You couldn't. You were only three.\" \"But, I do - I remember being very low down.\" \"Sweetie, you were always low down in those days. Anyway, she came round and we talked for a while and then she said to me again that I had treated him so badly and something snapped in me and I grabbed her hair ... \" \"Mummy!\" he says. \"It was sort of big, sticky-out hair - and I threw her out by it. Out the door and down the path.\" \"That was pretty violent.\" \"I agree, I behaved very badly. Sometimes grown-ups do. Maybe you're to young to hear all this.\" \"No! Please, I like it.\" I can't stop either. \"I wasn't just cross with her, you see. \"It was years of anger at my father.\" \"Because he didn't like you?\" \"Or love me.\" \"So what about the money? Did she give you some in the end?\" \"Goodness, no,\" I tell him. \"And I haven't seen her since. It's sad and awful, isn't it?\" He stares thoughtfully at the table. I think of how I've always wondered how I would tell him all of this. And now the moment has slid up on me, unasked for. Then, with all the controlled, forensic braininess we've taught him: \"You must realise, mummy,\" he says, \"what you've just told me is a very biased view.\" But it's not what I want right now: I feel the colour rise in my cheeks again. \"But darling, it's never right for a parent to cut children off like that, never. Whatever any of you did, Daddy and I would never ... \" \"Even if I committed murder?\" \"Even that. We think a parent's relationship with their child is the parent's responsibility - however old or bad the child is.\" \"But even if I wrote in the paper that you were a terrible novelist?\" \"Ah well, then of course I would cut you off.\" He grins. \"Are you surprised by all of this?\" I ask him gently. \"I don't know. Not really.\" \"So what are you thinking?\" \"If we go past Apollo, can we rent Gladiator again?\"",

The TV watchdog came to its conclusion after examining hours of tapes of the show over the past year. Its investigation followed the Sunday People's \"Sofagate\" stories, published in January, which alleged Ms Phillips wanted \u00a310,000 to promote the NSPCC's cause on her show. Ms Phillip's agent, Nicola Ibison, allegedly told the newspaper's undercover reporter Ms Phillips \"always tries to sneak in a mention\" on the live breakfast programme for the charities that pay her. The ITC investigated the claims because of the strict guidelines preventing presenters from promoting products or organisations on air. GMTV provided the TV watchdog with a random selection of programme tapes. On examining the footage, the ITC failed to find any references to the charities mentioned in the newspaper articles. The broadcaster also reviewed tapes and found no plugs of the type referred to in the Sunday People and also confirmed Ms Phillips had not authorised her agent to speak as she was reported to have done.",

Boot Camp, in which eight men and eight women are put through their paces by drill instructors in order to win a cash prize, had 0.85m viewers and a 7.7% share of multichannel viewing, according to unofficial overnights. These are good figures by Sky One's standards - in the week ending April 8, the channel's top-rated show was the Dervla Kirwan drama the Bombmaker with 0.86m viewers, according to official Barb audience figures. Boot Camp, which is broadcast between 8pm and 9pm, will almost certainly overtake this rating when video viewing is added to the official Barb statistics. The Boot Camp format was created in this country by Granada Media's Greenhouse Project, before being sold to Fox and developed for the US market. Temptation Island, another US reality show bought from Fox, opened with 0.56m viewers, according to overnights, and averaged more than 0.6m over its seven-part run on Sky One earlier this year. Sky One is planning to make an 18-hour UK version of Temptation Island for the autumn, which will be repeated on Channel 4.

Although the region has an extensive trade in child slaves, there was growing uncertainty whether in this case they existed. The government of Benin and UN officials had claimed that about 180 children destined to work as slaves on plantations in Gabon were in the Nigerian-registered MV Etireno. Benin issued an international arrest warrant for the captain and called on other countries to help track down the vessel when it went missing for several days. Cabinet ministers, the police and UN workers were waiting to board when it finally docked in Cotonou on Monday night. They had expected to find a horde of sick and malnourished children, based on police reports from Cameroon, where it was last seen. But only 43 minors were on board, about half of them 13 or younger. Social workers and foreign aid groups were trying to discover whether any of them were travelling against their will. The captain of the Etireno, Lawrence Onome, denied that there had been slave children on board. \"I have not committed any offence that will warrant my arrest,\" he said. \"I am not into child slavery, they cannot prove it. It is one thing to say and one thing to prove.\" UN officials in Cotonou speculated that the other children might have been put ashore elsewhere after the publicity about the ship and its cargo or, at worst, dumped at sea. But no evidence has emerged to support either theory and the Benin government says it mistakenly identified the Etireno because it was in the same area as another ship carrying the children, it alleges, had been regularly involving in carrying child slaves in the past five years. But the authorities in Benin have been unable to name the second ship or say where it is now. To add to the confusion, there were reports of a ship carrying a large number of children trying to dock in Equatorial Guinea, but it is unclear whether that was the MV Etireno during the days it was unaccounted for or another ship. What neither the government officials nor the aid workers are conceding at the moment is that the reports were wholly wrong from the beginning. The Unicef office in Libreville, Gabon, said the transport ministry there had confirmed that it turned away a second ship carrying about 250 Nigerian children a few days before the Etireno arrived.

Guardiola has already attracted interest from Newcastle United, managed by his former coach at Barcelona, Bobby Robson.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>For Westminster's chattering classes, the yet-to-be-called general election is already a bore. The Islington dinner party set decided more than six months ago that Mr Blair would win with a reduced, but still three figure, majority, William Hague would be culled along with the nation's cattle, Michael Portillo would finally decide he wanted to be leader - even if it was only of the opposition - and Charles Kennedy would stare into the abyss as the Lib Dems lost half their 1997 seats as tactical voting evaporated.</p> <p>Instead, the new game among political anoraks, and political journalists with little to report on, is The Great Tony Blair Second Term Reshuffle. This is based, if it is based on anything at all, on:<br> \u0095 the assumption of a large Labour majority<br> \u0095 the assumption that Tony Blair will want a \"honeymoon cull\" of his least favourite cabinet performers<br> \u0095 the need for middle-ranking ministers and ambitious<br> backbenchers to drop lobby journalists helpful hints about how and where their own talents could be best utilised.<br></p> <p>This spring's speculation has been given seasonal spice by the foot and mouth outbreak. Now knives are being sharpened not just for agriculture secretary Nick Brown, but for the entire Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The anachronistic department is just one piece of the Whitehall jigsaw on the agenda for Labour's forces of modernisation.</p> <p>So here is the full run-down on the latest insider knowledge/informed gossip/pure speculation doing the rounds:</p> <p><b>Those not going anywhere:</b><br></p> <p>\u0095 the prime minister, Tony Blair - unless the lure of little Leo proves too much for our family-friendly PM</p> <p>\u0095 the chancellor, Gordon Brown - there's only one post he's interested in, and it's not up for grabs</p> <p>\u0095 the foreign secretary, Robin Cook - with his only real rival spending more time in Hartlepool, and a steady pro at the wheel as President Bush sends jitters around the globe, Mr Blair sees no need for change at the most plum job</p> <p>\u0095 the health secretary, Alan Milburn - with his 10-year NHS plan recently set in motion, it would appear a loss of confidence to switch the pugnacious Geordie who has yet to put a foot wrong<br></p> <p>\u0095 the overseas development secretary, Clare Short - she loves the job, no Cabinet minister wants it, no backbencher would dare punt for it.<br></p> <p>\u0095 the Northern Ireland secretary John Reid - there's never a good time to lose a NI secretary, but for the prime minister to dump two within five months would look careless. In any case, he's doing a good job<br></p> <p>\u0095 the defence secretary, Geoff Hoon - has impressed Mr Blair in filling the Nato chief George Robertson's old post.</p> <p><b>Those on the move:</b></p> <p>\u0095 the deputy prime minister John Prescott has told \"friends\" he is willing to relinquish the strain of yoking together environment, transport and the regions for a beefed-up cabinet office role<br></p> <p>\u0095 the home secretary Jack Straw - the man dubbed \"minister for the interior\" by libertarian critics is keen to move across the cabinet table and take on education, especially with the emphasis on secondary schools in a Blair second term<br></p> <p>\u0095 the education secretary, David Blunkett - so powerful within cabinet he has already held an unofficial \"leaving\" do at the Department of Education and is champing at the bit to impose his thrifty working-class values at the Home Office. At the weekend, Mr Blunkett said: \"I have been in the job, in opposition as well , for six and a half years. That's a long time. I think the prime minister probably wants to reshuffle the cabinet\"<br></p> <p>\u0095 the trade and industry, secretary Stephen Byers - could head up the new Department for Work, merging social security and employment<br></p> <p>\u0095 the lord chancellor, Lord Irvine - definitely on the way out, Trevor Kavanagh, political editor of the Sun says so. Spent too much of Blair's goodwill on \u00a3300 rolls of wallpaper and embarrassing Labour-supporting lawyers into giving money to the cause<br></p> <p>\u0095 the Welsh secretary Paul Murphy - the job will disappear beneath him as role is subsumed into a ministry for the constitution<br></p> <p>\u0095 the Scottish secretary Helen Liddell - ditto, although she may grab the constitution post<br></p> <p>\u0095 the minister at environment, transport and regions, Lord MacDonald - the friend of the motorist is expected to land any new transport minister job. He is so highly thought of by Mr Blair that he could take over as leader of the Lords to smooth out reform of the upper chamber.

      "bodyText": "For Westminster's chattering classes, the yet-to-be-called general election is already a bore. The Islington dinner party set decided more than six months ago that Mr Blair would win with a reduced, but still three figure, majority, William Hague would be culled along with the nation's cattle, Michael Portillo would finally decide he wanted to be leader - even if it was only of the opposition - and Charles Kennedy would stare into the abyss as the Lib Dems lost half their 1997 seats as tactical voting evaporated. Instead, the new game among political anoraks, and political journalists with little to report on, is The Great Tony Blair Second Term Reshuffle. This is based, if it is based on anything at all, on: \u0095 the assumption of a large Labour majority \u0095 the assumption that Tony Blair will want a \"honeymoon cull\" of his least favourite cabinet performers \u0095 the need for middle-ranking ministers and ambitious backbenchers to drop lobby journalists helpful hints about how and where their own talents could be best utilised. This spring's speculation has been given seasonal spice by the foot and mouth outbreak. Now knives are being sharpened not just for agriculture secretary Nick Brown, but for the entire Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The anachronistic department is just one piece of the Whitehall jigsaw on the agenda for Labour's forces of modernisation. So here is the full run-down on the latest insider knowledge/informed gossip/pure speculation doing the rounds: Those not going anywhere: \u0095 the prime minister, Tony Blair - unless the lure of little Leo proves too much for our family-friendly PM \u0095 the chancellor, Gordon Brown - there's only one post he's interested in, and it's not up for grabs \u0095 the foreign secretary, Robin Cook - with his only real rival spending more time in Hartlepool, and a steady pro at the wheel as President Bush sends jitters around the globe, Mr Blair sees no need for change at the most plum job \u0095 the health secretary, Alan Milburn - with his 10-year NHS plan recently set in motion, it would appear a loss of confidence to switch the pugnacious Geordie who has yet to put a foot wrong \u0095 the overseas development secretary, Clare Short - she loves the job, no Cabinet minister wants it, no backbencher would dare punt for it. \u0095 the Northern Ireland secretary John Reid - there's never a good time to lose a NI secretary, but for the prime minister to dump two within five months would look careless. In any case, he's doing a good job \u0095 the defence secretary, Geoff Hoon - has impressed Mr Blair in filling the Nato chief George Robertson's old post. Those on the move: \u0095 the deputy prime minister John Prescott has told \"friends\" he is willing to relinquish the strain of yoking together environment, transport and the regions for a beefed-up cabinet office role \u0095 the home secretary Jack Straw - the man dubbed \"minister for the interior\" by libertarian critics is keen to move across the cabinet table and take on education, especially with the emphasis on secondary schools in a Blair second term \u0095 the education secretary, David Blunkett - so powerful within cabinet he has already held an unofficial \"leaving\" do at the Department of Education and is champing at the bit to impose his thrifty working-class values at the Home Office. At the weekend, Mr Blunkett said: \"I have been in the job, in opposition as well , for six and a half years. That's a long time. I think the prime minister probably wants to reshuffle the cabinet\" \u0095 the trade and industry, secretary Stephen Byers - could head up the new Department for Work, merging social security and employment \u0095 the lord chancellor, Lord Irvine - definitely on the way out, Trevor Kavanagh, political editor of the Sun says so. Spent too much of Blair's goodwill on \u00a3300 rolls of wallpaper and embarrassing Labour-supporting lawyers into giving money to the cause \u0095 the Welsh secretary Paul Murphy - the job will disappear beneath him as role is subsumed into a ministry for the constitution \u0095 the Scottish secretary Helen Liddell - ditto, although she may grab the constitution post \u0095 the minister at environment, transport and regions, Lord MacDonald - the friend of the motorist is expected to land any new transport minister job. He is so highly thought of by Mr Blair that he could take over as leader of the Lords to smooth out reform of the upper chamber. Quelling the toffs would be quite a prize for the former shipyard organiser. \u0095 the agriculture secretary, Nick Brown - after a calm start to the foot and mouth episode seen to have faltered in the final hurdles as Maff dithered. Could be returned to a behind the scenes role as chief whip. \u0095 Charles Clarke - the former Kinnock adviser is now No 3 at the Home Office. A charming bruiser, could do any cabinet job left over. Backbenchers hoping for a phone call from No 10: \u0095 Oona King - a telegenic loyalist with a keen interest in the developing world, could fit smoothly into junior foreign office post. \u0095 Chris Leslie - Brownite baby of the house [at least until David Lammy was elected], as a keen advocate of air traffic privatisation and PPS to Lord Falconer he could go far if he can hold his formerly Tory seat. Departments expected to be rejigged: \u0095 the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food - agriculture and fisheries to be merged into trade and industry, food safety to environment and the new food standards agency, if the recent institute for public policy research thinktank report finds agreement with the PM \u0095 the Department of Social Security - could join employment as the new ministry for work \u0095 the Welsh and Scottish offices - merged into a new body, the ministry for the constitutional affairs, which would also oversee any English regional assemblies.

      "bodyText": "Internet and cable giant AOL Time Warner has brushed off the slump in the media sector thanks to a surge in subscriber numbers. The world's largest media company, formed by last year's merger of America Online and Time Warner, said revenues for the first three months of the year had risen 9% to \u00a35.6bn, with subscriptions making up nearly half of the total. AOL Time Warner said its subscriber base has grown 16% to 133m, with AOL's customer figures climbing to 29m. The group also bucked the trend of falling advertising revenues in the media sector by reporting a 10% rise in advertising and commerce income to \u00a32.2bn. John Levin, chief executive of AOL Time Warner, said the results underlined the \"unique promise\" of the \u00a3130bn company, which contains prime assets such as the CNN news network, Time magazine and Warner Music. \"We are aggressively rolling out next-generation products and services that will fuel continued growth momentum in our subscription and advertising and commerce businesses,\" said Mr Levin. The figures were in line with analysts' expectations, but there was no mention of the looming actors' and writers' strikes in the US, which will affect revenues at the group's Warner films and television divisions. AOL Time Warner is a preferred stock for many analysts, because its lack of exposure to the advertising market gives it better protection against the downturn in the US economy. The company has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 US stock market index over the past 12 months, despite a downturn which has forced its rivals to revise earnings estimates and cut jobs. However, industry observers will be itching for the group to deliver on its promises of integrating products across its internet and cable distribution platforms. The main barrier to fulfilling this promise is the slow roll-out of broadband internet services in the US, and the fact that advertisers remain wary of the internet across the Atlantic.",

      "bodyText": "Israel's hardline prime minister, Ariel Sharon, was last night forced to order out his tanks from territory recaptured from the Palestinians in Gaza, in the face of unprecedented international condemnation. Only hours after a senior Israeli army general promised that the military occupation could last for weeks or even months, news agencies reported that the withdrawal had started. Mr Sharon's spokesman, Raanan Gissin, claimed that this was according to plan: \"We always said that it will happen when the military operation ends,\" he said. The apparent about-turn followed an unusually out spoken intervention by the American secretary of state, Colin Powell, who accused the Israeli army of an \"excessive and disproportionate\" response to Palestinian mortar attacks. Mr Powell said that Israel was failing to uphold its commitment under the Oslo accords of 1993 which awarded Palestinians control of designated areas of Gaza. \"The situation is threatening to escalate further, posing the risk of a broader conflict,\" he said. The operation to reoccupy the Palestinian-controlled territory around the town of Beit Hanoun - in northern Gaza - had commenced before dawn yesterday when Israeli tanks began shelling outlying Palestinian border posts north and east of the town. A Palestinian border guard was killed by a direct hit from a rocket, and 36 people were hurt. Later in the day, two Palestinian youths, aged 10 and 14, were killed in separate shooting incidents in Gaza involving Israeli soldiers. At Beit Hanoun, Palestinian officials said Israeli troops thrust a kilometre inside Palestinian territory, bulldozing or rocketing four police posts. They razed houses and citrus trees in the most fertile part of a pitifully overcrowded and parched territory, and dug a trench to seal off the northern hinterland from the town centre. The move was met by instant outrage. The Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, said peace efforts were dead. \"I don't see any possibility of success this way,\" he said. \"What happened was an unforgiveable crime,\" Mr Arafat said, arriving in the West Bank city of Ramallah from Jordan. \"These raids are not just an escalation but they are dirty and are intended to bring our people to their knees.\" Israel's stated justification for the action was to protect Israeli citizens from mortar fire from inside Gaza. Brigadier General Yair Naveh - the commander of the army's Gaza brigade who predicted the occupation could last months - said it was a defensive operation. \"Its aim is to create and stabilise a line that will enable our citizens, in Sderot and other communities in the area, to sleep peacefully,\" he said. On Monday night, five mortar shells had landed on the edges of Sderot, a development town inside the borders of Israel which lies just up the road from the farm belonging to Mr Sharon. Israel said the mortars were fired from Beit Hanoun. From yesterday's events, it had appeared the army was intent on widening its security perimeter inside the borders of the Gaza Strip. Under the Oslo accords, Palestinian security forces cannot patrol within 500 metres of Gaza's borders with the Jewish state without Israeli army permission. But that security cordon does not provide protection from long-range mortars. The Islamist militant group Hamas claimed the attack on Sderot but Gen Naveh, echoing previous Israeli charges, said the strike bore the \"fingerprints of the Palestinian Authority\". The attack, the latest in a spate of mortar strikes, caused no damage or injuries, but Israel said the targeting of a town within the borders of the Jewish state was unacceptable. \"This is unjustified and crosses the line,\" the foreign minister, Shimon Peres, told Israel radio. \"There's a limit to everything.\" Israel had threatened repeatedly in recent weeks that it would retake some Palestinian-controlled areas if the escalation in violence continued. Israeli troops entered Palestinian-ruled areas in Gaza three times during the last week, and its bulldozers regularly razed farm land and houses. It has shelled Palestinian police posts - as it did in Beit Hanoun yesterday morning, and in Gaza City overnight on Monday, where eight security installations were hit. For the last six years, the people of Beit Hanoun have lived under the Oslo agreement and under autonomous Palestinian control. They have had virtually no contact with Israel, or its army, unless they tried to leave the territory. For several hours yesterday they were back under occupation - indefinitely as it then seemed. As the troop withdrawal began last night, it was still unclear whether the Israeli army would quit other strategic parts of Gaza that it had captured yesterday. Soldiers sealed off the road at two junctions, effectively slicing the territory into three pieces and cutting off Gaza City from its hinterland. They also closed the Rafah border crossing to Egypt. \"The Israeli soldiers are trying to get as close as they can to the Palestinians, and to cut off as much of their movement as they can, without putting themselves at risk,\" a foreign diplomat said. \"They do not want to go back to the first intifada in the 1980s when they were holding on to densely populated Palestinian towns.\" Audio Suzanne Goldenberg in Jerusalem (3mins) Talk about it What do you think?

      "byline": "Mark Tran and Derek Brown",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<b>Why vaccinate?</b> <br>To contain the spread of foot and mouth. Those in favour of vaccination, including the Soil Association, the National Trust, the RSPB and the Wildlife Trusts, say that the present policy of mass slaughter is not working - there are simply too many animals (568,000) to be killed. <p><b>Does vaccination work?</b><br>Not always. Pigs are particularly unpredictable and vaccination does not work if the animal is already infected. Farmers argue that it is not 100% effective.</p> <p><b>Would all animals have to be vaccinated?</b><br>That would be impossible, given that there are 60m cattle, sheep and pigs in Britain, not to mention a million deer and countless other wild animals which can contract or carry the disease. The pro-vaccine camp wants a programme of \"ring\" vaccination around infected farms and abattoirs. Animals within the cordon sanitaire would be vaccinated, and slaughtered later if necessary, when the disease is under control. </p> <p><b>What are the disadvantages of vaccination?</b><br>It is expensive. Scientists have suggested that initially 180,000 animals, in Devon and Cumbria, should be vaccinated against the disease. The cost of vaccination is \u00a35 a shot, which means the initial cost of the mooted programme would be \u00a3900,000. </p> <p>Treatment also needs to be repeated every six months, and given to each new generation of animals. The adoption of vaccination as a policy is a tacit admission that foot and mouth has not been eradicated. </p> <p><b>Why do many farmers with healthy animals to protect still resist vaccination?</b><br>Their main argument is that it is impossible to distinguish between vaccinated animals and those with the disease. That could mean the loss of Britain's disease-free status and the destruction of the \u00a31bn-plus meat export trade. However, according to EU rules, a limited vaccination programme would mean a 12-month ban on exports, not a permanent one.</p> <p><b>Has the export trade not gone already?</b><br> There is a total ban on export of meat and live animals, so long as the disease persists. That is why most farmers favour drastic action to end the crisis as quickly as possible.</p> <p><b>Are farmers not also worried about consumer reaction?</b><br> They are concerned about consumer resistance to meat and milk that come from vaccinated animals. Although Sainsbury's and Tesco have said that they would agree to sell food and milk from vaccinated products, consumers may shun them, leading to a \"two-tier\" market.</p> <p><b>Is there any public health risk from vaccinated animals?</b><br> The food standards agency says that vaccinating animals against foot and mouth poses no risk to public safety so any food and milk sold from vaccinated animals will not carry warning labels. But with the BSE scare still fresh in people's minds, the public may take some convincing.</p> <p><b>How does the government plan to overcome consumer resistance?</b><br> With strict conditions. Milk from vaccinated animals can only continue to be sold if it is pasteurised and there will be a ban on selling raw milk from such animals. Meat will have to be heated to a temperature that kills the virus but does not cook the meat.</p> <p><b>Email update</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/email\">Sign up for our

      "bodyText": "Why vaccinate? To contain the spread of foot and mouth. Those in favour of vaccination, including the Soil Association, the National Trust, the RSPB and the Wildlife Trusts, say that the present policy of mass slaughter is not working - there are simply too many animals (568,000) to be killed. Does vaccination work? Not always. Pigs are particularly unpredictable and vaccination does not work if the animal is already infected. Farmers argue that it is not 100% effective. Would all animals have to be vaccinated? That would be impossible, given that there are 60m cattle, sheep and pigs in Britain, not to mention a million deer and countless other wild animals which can contract or carry the disease. The pro-vaccine camp wants a programme of \"ring\" vaccination around infected farms and abattoirs. Animals within the cordon sanitaire would be vaccinated, and slaughtered later if necessary, when the disease is under control. What are the disadvantages of vaccination? It is expensive. Scientists have suggested that initially 180,000 animals, in Devon and Cumbria, should be vaccinated against the disease. The cost of vaccination is \u00a35 a shot, which means the initial cost of the mooted programme would be \u00a3900,000. Treatment also needs to be repeated every six months, and given to each new generation of animals. The adoption of vaccination as a policy is a tacit admission that foot and mouth has not been eradicated. Why do many farmers with healthy animals to protect still resist vaccination? Their main argument is that it is impossible to distinguish between vaccinated animals and those with the disease. That could mean the loss of Britain's disease-free status and the destruction of the \u00a31bn-plus meat export trade. However, according to EU rules, a limited vaccination programme would mean a 12-month ban on exports, not a permanent one. Has the export trade not gone already? There is a total ban on export of meat and live animals, so long as the disease persists. That is why most farmers favour drastic action to end the crisis as quickly as possible. Are farmers not also worried about consumer reaction? They are concerned about consumer resistance to meat and milk that come from vaccinated animals. Although Sainsbury's and Tesco have said that they would agree to sell food and milk from vaccinated products, consumers may shun them, leading to a \"two-tier\" market. Is there any public health risk from vaccinated animals? The food standards agency says that vaccinating animals against foot and mouth poses no risk to public safety so any food and milk sold from vaccinated animals will not carry warning labels. But with the BSE scare still fresh in people's minds, the public may take some convincing. How does the government plan to overcome consumer resistance? With strict conditions. Milk from vaccinated animals can only continue to be sold if it is pasteurised and there will be a ban on selling raw milk from such animals. Meat will have to be heated to a temperature that kills the virus but does not cook the meat.

The legal documents called on the court to grant an interim interdict preventing the cull pending a full judicial review of the Scottish executive's decision.

The cull was ordered after it became known the Mr Shepherd, who runs six crofts at Strathnaver and Strathtongue, had visited his brother in an infected area in Cumbria. His actions were condemned by Jim Walker, president of the National Farmers' Union of Scotland, who branded Mr Shepherd \"stupid\" and said his decision to visit Cumbria \"beggared belief\".

      "body": "<p>If there was a Bafta for brass neck, then Angus Deayton would be favourite to take it. In a gift to his Have I Got News for You colleagues, the presenter has secured a \u00a350,000 contract for one night's work at the television industry's annual love-in. </p> <p>Deayton's lucrative package to host the Bafta television awards for the BBC next month is one of the biggest deals of its kind. The broadcaster had originally set aside \u00a320,000 to pay for the ceremony's host. The deal, which includes Deayton's fee, his own scriptwriters, and a tailor-made suit, was sanctioned by the BBC's director of drama and entertainment, Alan Yentob. </p> <p>It has caused some disquiet at the corporation: some insiders believe that Deayton's fee outweighs his profile. Davina McCall was paid around \u00a315,000 to front the Brit awards for ITV last year, while Ant and Dec commanded a similar deal for this year's show. </p> <p>But the deal is an indication of the success with which showbusiness agents are able to trade on the increasing demand for TV presenters, with the proliferation of awards ceremonies, game shows, discussion programmes and other personality-led formats. </p> <p>The BBC cast around for a number of presenters before settling on Deayton. It is thought that Graham Norton turned down an offer because of other commitments; the former footballer Ian Wright, who has just signed an exclusive \u00a31m deal with the corporation, was also mentioned. </p> <p>Deayton was finally chosen because he is a \"BBC face\".

      "bodyText": "If there was a Bafta for brass neck, then Angus Deayton would be favourite to take it. In a gift to his Have I Got News for You colleagues, the presenter has secured a \u00a350,000 contract for one night's work at the television industry's annual love-in. Deayton's lucrative package to host the Bafta television awards for the BBC next month is one of the biggest deals of its kind. The broadcaster had originally set aside \u00a320,000 to pay for the ceremony's host. The deal, which includes Deayton's fee, his own scriptwriters, and a tailor-made suit, was sanctioned by the BBC's director of drama and entertainment, Alan Yentob. It has caused some disquiet at the corporation: some insiders believe that Deayton's fee outweighs his profile. Davina McCall was paid around \u00a315,000 to front the Brit awards for ITV last year, while Ant and Dec commanded a similar deal for this year's show. But the deal is an indication of the success with which showbusiness agents are able to trade on the increasing demand for TV presenters, with the proliferation of awards ceremonies, game shows, discussion programmes and other personality-led formats. The BBC cast around for a number of presenters before settling on Deayton. It is thought that Graham Norton turned down an offer because of other commitments; the former footballer Ian Wright, who has just signed an exclusive \u00a31m deal with the corporation, was also mentioned. Deayton was finally chosen because he is a \"BBC face\". But one BBC programme-maker said that the presenter, who is nominated for best entertainment performance at the Baftas, was overrated. \"He's not much good without a script and an autocue,\" the source said. It is thought that Deayton was able to secure such a high fee because the BBC was beginning to worry about whether it could secure a big enough name in time. Deayton's star is in the ascendancy: all the performers in Have I Got News for You are reported to have received a hefty hike in their fees when the show transferred from BBC2 to BBC1. He also has a lucrative deal fronting the Barclaycard advertising campaign. The BBC is prepared to play an increasingly commercial game to secure key talent. The signing of Wright indicated that the BBC1 controller, Lorraine Heggessey, was determined to nurture a new generation of presenters who would be readily associated with her channel. One commercial television executive said of the Baftas deal: \"I just cannot under stand why the BBC thought that he was worth this amount of money. For some reason, Deayton is one of those people who can command vast fees for whatever he does.\" A BBC spokeswoman said: \"We can't discuss the figures, but we think Angus is a highly talented presenter and we are delighted to have secured his services.\" \u0095 Angus Deayton is the odd one out: Paul Merton, Ian Hislop and, as far as we know, the lard have never earned \u00a350,000 and a free suit for a couple of hours work.

However, officials are stressing that the programme could not be expected to work without \"substantial support\" from farmers.</p> <p>With the National Farmers' Union (NFU) currently blocking the move, it was anticipated that Professor King and Mr Scudamore would set out their reasoning at a briefing this morning. It was hoped that by clearly stating the scientific case they might win over the NFU leadership.</p> <p>The government's agricultural development and advisory service has already placed advertisements in job centres in Cumbria and Devon for people to carry out the programme.</p> <p>But the extent of farmers' suspicion of the proposed programme was underlined by NFU president Ben Gill.</p> <p>Mr Gill said: \"We have put forward a list of questions that we required to be answered, on trade related issues, on consumer related issues, and on veterinary and epidemiological issues.</p> <p>\"We have had some answers, but regrettably those answers have spawned even more questions.

      "bodyText": "Government advisers were today expected to set out the scientific case for a limited foot and mouth vaccination programme in a bid to win the support of sceptical farmers. Ministers believe the jabs are now needed in Cumbria, where the disease has struck hardest, and possibly in Devon, which is also severely hit. However, farmers' leaders are resisting the move, arguing there are still unanswered questions over whether it will work and what the possible economic fallout might be. The attempt to convince farmers was expected to come as the prime minister, Tony Blair, was expected to make a further effort to boost the stricken tourist industry. Downing Street has said the government \"accepts in principle\" arguments for limited vaccination from the chief vet, Jim Scudamore, and the chief scientist, Professor David King. Jabs were \"justified as a means of protecting those animals\", a spokesperson said last night. However, officials are stressing that the programme could not be expected to work without \"substantial support\" from farmers. With the National Farmers' Union (NFU) currently blocking the move, it was anticipated that Professor King and Mr Scudamore would set out their reasoning at a briefing this morning. It was hoped that by clearly stating the scientific case they might win over the NFU leadership. The government's agricultural development and advisory service has already placed advertisements in job centres in Cumbria and Devon for people to carry out the programme. But the extent of farmers' suspicion of the proposed programme was underlined by NFU president Ben Gill. Mr Gill said: \"We have put forward a list of questions that we required to be answered, on trade related issues, on consumer related issues, and on veterinary and epidemiological issues. \"We have had some answers, but regrettably those answers have spawned even more questions. Not because we want to be bloodyminded, but because before we make such a far-reaching jump into the future, my members have a right to know that they are not actually doing anything more than putting a ball on a roulette wheel that might come up trumps, but has a far greater chance of being a long-term denigration to our industry.\" The total number of confirmed cases in Great Britain reached 1,365 as of 7pm yesterday - an increase of 22 over the day before. The prime minister chaired a series of meetings in Downing Street yesterday on foot and mouth, discussing latest developments with the agriculture minister, Nick Brown, other ministers, Mr Scudamore and Professor King. After around two hours of discussions, a No 10 spokesman said that the scientists firmly advocated a limited vaccination programme for cattle in Cumbria and Devon. Vaccination, the spokesman stressed, would be a \"supplement\" to the current culling policy.

The origin of \"JK\" goes back to the advice from her publisher Bloomsbury that the adventures of an 11-year-old boy who goes to wizard school would not appeal to 11-year-old boys if written too identifiably by a woman. </p> <p> Ironically, the initials provided a kind of anonymity and mystique, behind which Rowling was able to guard her privacy. Beyond the fact that she was a young-ish single mother who had written parts of the first book sitting in a cafe in Edinburgh because her flat was unheated, relatively little was known. Only when the third book (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban) was published did the media's curiosity force her hand: \"So I decided that I would give interviews - when I had something to say.\" </p> <p> She has plenty to say about the way single parents get blamed for everything from falling morals to rising crime: \"It's this universal human desire we have through history: if we demonise them, we don't have to help them. It's much easier for certain sections of society to say, 'You've brought this on yourself by your fecklessness; you sort it out,' than to say, 'You've been a victim of circumstances,' or 'Hey, marriages break up ... but how are we going to help you help yourself?' </p> <p> \"I never set out to be a lone parent - and there I was,\" she says. \"It's undeniable: there's a stigma attached. But I was the most unashamed lone parent you were ever going to meet. I was, like, 'And what is your problem? I'm doing a great job.' I'm very impatient with the idea that any of us should be ashamed about it.\" </p> <p> Rowling became a single parent when her marriage to Portuguese television journalist Jorge Arantes fell apart shortly after the birth of her daughter Jessica. \"It was my Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee moment,\" she jokes. \"It is the most humiliating thing, actually: you're supposed to have your relationship disaster in your teens, aren't you - and then wise up?\" </p> <p> Rowling left Portugal in early 1994 and came to Edinburgh, planning to stay with her sister Di for a few weeks until she found her feet. She never left. \"Edinburgh is beautiful,\" she explains, \"has good public transport and did have, then, free museums, and I thought, 'I'll have a much better life here on a low income with my daughter.' I could just see that broke single-parenthood here would be easier.\" </p> <p> \"Poverty is the issue,\" she continues. \"I do say that partly out of my own experience, but I am acutely aware when I talk about single parents being poor that, for me, it was a temporary state and it was always likely to be. We were never going to be rich if I had been a teacher, but we were never going to be dirt poor. And I had middle-class friends who could lend me a tenner.\" </p> <p> Rowling's success as an author - the four Harry Potter books to date have sold more than 90m copies worldwide and been translated into 42 languages - has clearly removed that problem. The days of sitting in a cafe, snatching a few hours to write while Jessica slept in her pushchair, are long gone. Jessica, now seven, goes to school, and has a nanny who picks her up two days a week, while Rowling looks after her the other three. </p> <p> \"She's embarrassingly precocious and gloats about the places she's been,\" she says. \"I heard her saying: 'I went to the Space Needle in Seattle, but Mummy couldn't go; Mummy was in a bookshop.' I'm like: 'Yeah, cheers, I know.' \" </p> <p> So does money solve all the problems of being a single parent? \"No, but it sure as hell helps. The worst of being a single parent is constantly thinking, 'I can't give you what I want to give you.' \" </p> <p> Rowling named her daughter after Jessica Mitford, sister of Nancy, author and avowed communist, whose autobiography Rowling read as a teenager. \"Basically, [Mitford] had every single possible component you could want as a 13-year-old leftwinger.\" </p> <p> Rowling looks an unlikely rebel. She was head girl of her comprehensive school in Chepstow - but she was the sort, she says, who got \"caught smoking at bus stops with boys in leather jackets\". Now 35, she is slim and chic in fitted black rollneck and charcoal hipster pants that flare from the knee. She shakes her head now and then to clear the blonde fringe from her vision - a mannerism that gives her an air of diffidence. But when she fixes you with her blue-grey eyes, you don't doubt that here is a person with some steel. </p> <p> \"It's a funny thing,\" she muses, \"but I doubt very much there would have been a Jessie if mum hadn't died when she did. I only went abroad nine months after she died: I really needed to get away. A lot of bad stuff had happened, and I needed to sort myself out a bit. And obviously, I met my ex-husband and Jessica was the result, so life does go on. </p> <p> \"It was doing a big rebound job, really,\" she adds. \"That's when you're most vulnerable.\" </p> <p> Her mother Anne had died in 1990 from multiple sclerosis at the age of 45. With just 20 years between them, Jo and her mother had been very close. \"Because I was the older child, to me she was almost like an older sister. I was never in any doubt that she was my mum, but that kind of relationship was there. I could talk to her a lot more freely than some of my friends spoke to their mothers.\" </p> <p> Anne Rowling had been 35 when first diagnosed with the illness - \"the same age as me now, which is a bit of a facer, isn't it?\" Because of the experience of losing her mother, Rowling has recently embraced the MS Society in Scotland and will be helping to publicise MS awareness week shortly. Anne had been a wheelchair user since Jo graduated from Exeter University, but the end, when it came, still seemed sudden. </p> <p> \"The last time I saw her before she died, I went back for Christmas,\" she recalls, haltingly. \"I can't believe in retrospect that I didn't really realise what was about to happen because she was so ill. Her mobility was very limited; she looked ill, very ill - which I'd never really seen before. She was absolutely exhausted. </p> <p> \"She died at home, of respiratory failure. Dad went upstairs and found her dead.\" </p> <p> Part of the appeal of the Harry Potter stories is the way Rowling's fiction engages with the dark stuff. Rowling began work on the first book just six months before her mother died. It is one of those well-known facts that the idea of Harry's world first came to Rowling on a train journey to King's Cross; but it was also on a train from that station that her mother and father first met. \"That's obviously why it looms large in my psyche,\" she comments wryly. </p> <p> Her mother's death, she says, made the fact that Harry is an orphan and the theme of death and loss \"immeasurably more important\", and she alludes to the now famous episode in chapter 12 of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, when Harry sees his dead parents in the Mirror of Erised (Desire backwards). What, I wonder, would Rowling see in the mirror? </p> <p> \"It would be my mother,\" she says without hesitation. \"You'd want five minutes to say, 'I have a daughter, and she's called Jessica, and she looks like this and she likes this, and I wrote some books - and Mum, guess what happened?' </p> <p> \"I'd gabble on and at the end of five minutes I'd realise I hadn't asked what it's like to be dead. It's the selfishness of the child, isn't it? - at least I'm aware of that. But it couldn't be long enough. That was all in that mirror episode, I think: recognising that it's just not healthy, not good for you to dwell and dwell and dwell. </p> <p> \"It's not about forgetting, but you have got to move on.\" </p> <p>\u0095 This is an edited version of an article that appears in the May issue of In Style, on sale from Friday.</p>",

The NUT backed the motion at its conference this week, as did the Association of Teachers and Lecturers at its conference.</p> <p>In a parallel move, the NUT yesterday threatened to boycott the government's scheme for appraising staff performance, unless ministers dropped plans to link it to pay rises.</p> <p>In a defeat for the union's leadership on the last day of its annual conference in Cardiff, delegates demanded a ballot on a boycott of the performance management system.</p> <p>Members are furious that the government proposes to use the results of that appraisal, carried out by headteachers, in decisions on whether teachers should receive performance-related pay.</p> <p>The motion called for a ballot on the boycott in the autumn, but the leadership wants to delay.</p> <p>Doug McAvoy, general secretary, said he would first press the government to include performance management in the promised review of teachers' workload. He also wants a delay until the report next spring of the school teachers' review body, which decides on pay.</p> <p>But he added that unless the government ended the link between performance management and pay, the union would eventually take industrial action.</p> <p>Delegates backed the ballot call by 112,203 to 87,879. A source close to David Blunkett, education secretary, said the conference had made \"a particularly silly decision\", as performance management had already delivered \u00a32,000 rises to more than 150,000 experienced classroom teachers at the top of their pay scale.</p> <p>On other key issues the conference had backed the leadership.</p> <p>In his speech to close the five-day meeting, Mr McAvoy told delegates they had to accept some system of performance management, even if they opposed the government's scheme. \"We are not free agents, how can we ever argue that headteachers should be ignorant of the strengths and weaknesses of teaching in their schools?\"</p> <p>He told them to \"cheer up\" and acknowledge some of the gains the union had achieved for teachers. It had \"stopped the cover-up\" on teacher shortages, forced the general teaching council to cut its fee for teachers, won members the right of appeal against being denied performance related pay and helped to persuade Ofsted to reform the school inspection system.</p> <p>Mr McAvoy rounded on leftwingers for opposing the terms of a motion calling for the union to work towards the merger of the main classroom unions.</p> <p>Most members back the idea in principle, but many are concerned that it will lead to watered down NUT policy.</p> <p>He told delegates: \"We have an opportunity to progress towards professional unity, an opportunity that will be lost if we fail to show discipline and understanding in our joint campaigns. Let us strive for the biggest prize.\"</p> <p>The joint motion on teachers' hours calls for a maximum 35-hour week with no more than 22.5 hours of teaching, in line with recommendations of the independent McCrone inquiry in Scotland.</p> <p>The talks on reducing workload, involving ministers, unions and employers, are likely to focus on the scope of an inquiry, which the government has insisted will not include pay.</p>",

The crucial thing is that we end the open-ended contracts which trigger extra workload for teachers.\" His union is expected today to back, by a huge majority, a joint motion calling for the weekly hours limit - in line with a deal already offered to Scottish teachers. The NUT backed the motion at its conference this week, as did the Association of Teachers and Lecturers at its conference. In a parallel move, the NUT yesterday threatened to boycott the government's scheme for appraising staff performance, unless ministers dropped plans to link it to pay rises. In a defeat for the union's leadership on the last day of its annual conference in Cardiff, delegates demanded a ballot on a boycott of the performance management system. Members are furious that the government proposes to use the results of that appraisal, carried out by headteachers, in decisions on whether teachers should receive performance-related pay. The motion called for a ballot on the boycott in the autumn, but the leadership wants to delay. Doug McAvoy, general secretary, said he would first press the government to include performance management in the promised review of teachers' workload. He also wants a delay until the report next spring of the school teachers' review body, which decides on pay. But he added that unless the government ended the link between performance management and pay, the union would eventually take industrial action. Delegates backed the ballot call by 112,203 to 87,879. A source close to David Blunkett, education secretary, said the conference had made \"a particularly silly decision\", as performance management had already delivered \u00a32,000 rises to more than 150,000 experienced classroom teachers at the top of their pay scale. On other key issues the conference had backed the leadership. In his speech to close the five-day meeting, Mr McAvoy told delegates they had to accept some system of performance management, even if they opposed the government's scheme. \"We are not free agents, how can we ever argue that headteachers should be ignorant of the strengths and weaknesses of teaching in their schools?\" He told them to \"cheer up\" and acknowledge some of the gains the union had achieved for teachers. It had \"stopped the cover-up\" on teacher shortages, forced the general teaching council to cut its fee for teachers, won members the right of appeal against being denied performance related pay and helped to persuade Ofsted to reform the school inspection system. Mr McAvoy rounded on leftwingers for opposing the terms of a motion calling for the union to work towards the merger of the main classroom unions. Most members back the idea in principle, but many are concerned that it will lead to watered down NUT policy. He told delegates: \"We have an opportunity to progress towards professional unity, an opportunity that will be lost if we fail to show discipline and understanding in our joint campaigns. Let us strive for the biggest prize.\" The joint motion on teachers' hours calls for a maximum 35-hour week with no more than 22.5 hours of teaching, in line with recommendations of the independent McCrone inquiry in Scotland. The talks on reducing workload, involving ministers, unions and employers, are likely to focus on the scope of an inquiry, which the government has insisted will not include pay.",

      "bodyText": "One2One is quietly dropping its \"Welcome to your world\" tagline after less than two years for a new campaign that focuses on the important conversations in people's lives. The telecoms giant is shooting a new commercial with actor Gary Oldman, which it says will \"celebrate the pivotal One2Ones in everyone's lives\". Details of the commercial are being kept under wraps, but it is not expected to include the \"Welcome to your world\" line introduced in December 1999 in an advert starring football hard man Vinnie Jones. The advertising replaced the long-running \"Who would you like to have a One2One with?\" campaign, in which celebrities including Kate Moss and Chris Evans described dream conversations with their heroes. The new tagline was designed to promote the whole range of services offered by One2One, rather than just showing someone talking on a mobile. The old line is being dropped because the company wanted its brand name to become more central to its advertising. It is the first time Oldman, who appeared in Hannibal and Air Force One, has appeared in a TV commercial. \"One2One's award-winning and inspirational advertising heritage allows us to attract major celebrities to star in our commercials,\" said Tim Yates, marketing director for One2One. \"Gary Oldman is the perfect choice to star in the forthcoming interwoven story that, I'm sure, will delight and intrigue viewers over the coming months.\" The new campaign was created by Bartle Bogle Hegarty and will appear on TV screens in May.",

      "body": "<p>Trevor Nunn, the multi-millionaire artistic director of the Royal National Theatre - whose regime has been criticised for its timidity and unashamed commercialism - is to step down. Nunn, 61, who has long insisted that he would not be hounded out of one of the toughest jobs in theatre and would outlast his critics, could go by September next year.</p> <p>In a low-key statement slipped out over Easter, the National's board announced that Nunn was \"not seeking reappointment\".</p> <p>The statement continued: \"Even so, he has generously agreed to stay in post until a successor is ready to take over ... He has, by his leadership and example, enhanced the reputation of the National Theatre and upheld the standards established by his predecessors, Laurence Olivier, Peter Hall and Richard Eyre.\" Nunn refused to comment.</p> <p>His four-year tenure of the National's brutalist bunker on the South Bank has been attacked for its \"drift and muddle\" and has been characterised by what one critic called a \"saturation diet of musicals\".</p> <p>Major achievements such as the amazing ensemble of actors he has put together, and greatly increased touring, have been obscured by the flak Nunn has attracted for eschewing the radical new work many believe the National was set up to perform in favour of such \"safe\" bets as his revival of Oklahoma!.</p> <p>Anti-Nunn opinion was further inflamed by the cut he took from the musical's lucrative transfer to the West End. Unlike his predecessor, Sir Richard Eyre, whose fee from transferred productions such as Guys and Dolls was capped at a low level, Nunn's is not limited, although he cannot earn more than the National itself.</p> <p>The precise nature of his contract with the theatre, however, is confidential. His bank balance will be further enhanced by a planned Broadway run of Oklahoma! and Nunn is also likely to make up to \u00a31m when his sell-out production of My Fair Lady moves to the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane in July in another of the tie-ups with the impresario Cameron Mackintosh which has so angered some of his peers.</p> <p><b> Joint ventures</b><br></p> <p>Two years ago Nunn was estimated to be worth more than \u00a343m by the Sunday Times rich list, mainly from his joint ventures with Andrew Lloyd Webber on the musicals Cats and Les Miserables.</p> <p>His personal fortune has risen sharply since then, though his National salary brings in a comparatively modest \u00a3120,000 a year.</p> <p>Sir Christopher Hogg, the National's chairman, however, had no such qualms about dallying with the commercial sector and claimed that even with its \u00a313m grant, subsidy covered only 36% of their overheads as against more than 60% in the past.</p> <p>\"One should be so lucky to have a public-private partnership in which you enlist well below market cost the services of someone of the class of Trevor.\"</p> <p>He also pointed to the success of such outwardly uncommercial plays as Michael Frayn's Copenhagen - about the ethics of scientists building nuclear weapons - and Joe Penhall's Blue/Orange - about schizophrenia - during Nunn's reign</p> <p>After two gilded decades at the Royal Shakespeare Company, Nunn felt he was \"doing the National a favour\" by taking over from Sir Richard Eyre when no suitable replacement for him could be found in 1997.</p> <p>He has made no secret of the fact that his wife, the actor Imogen Stubbs, was not happy he had taken on \"the nightmare\" that comes with having to fill 2,500 seats in three different auditoriums every night.</p> <p>Worn down eventually by the constant sniping, Nunn is believed to have made the decision to bow to the inevitable at the end of last year and since then Sir Christopher has been lunching a long line of likely candidates including Nicholas Hytner, another director with an impressive commercial pedigree.</p> <p>With no heirs apparent waiting in the wings - another of the many accusations levelled at Nunn was that he acted like a \"one-man band\" - the race for his replacement is probably the most open in the National's history.</p> <p>Although his Oscar-nomination for his debut film Billy Elliot has brought Hollywood to his door, Stephen Daldry, the mercurial former director of the Royal Court, now in the final stages of filming his second film, The Hours, is seen by many as the best chance of the reviving the institution's radical spirit.</p> <p>At 39, and with an impressive track record of combining edgier new writing and canny, yet politically relevant West End hits like An Inspector Calls, he has been playing his cards close to his chest. When asked by the Guardian recently if he would take the job, the normally forthright Daldry demurred.</p> <p>\"Ask me anything but that. It's more than my life's worth to say anything about that,\" was his reply.</p> <p><b> Dream team</b><br></p> <p>A dream team of Daldry and Sam Mendes, the Oscar-winning director of American Beauty, who runs the Donmar Warehouse, has long been mooted, though with both now combining theatre and film, it looks highly unlikely.</p> <p>A strong head of steam, however, has been building up behind Jude Kelly, the artistic director of West Yorkshire Playhouse, who is believed to have the vocal backing on the National's board from Booker Prize-winning novelist Ben Okri, whose play she will soon stage, and the black academic Lola Young.</p> <p>As well as her proven track record, Kelly would have the added appeal of being the first ever woman to run the National Theatre.</p> <p>Whatever he does after his \"retirement\", Nunn will not be short of a few bob. For his final year at the National he is directing another musical, South Pacific, A Streetcar Named Desire starring Glenn Close and a new trilogy of plays by Tom Stoppard.</p> <p>All have a huge potential for commercial transfer, which he stands poised to benefit from.</p> <p><b>Related stories</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,3604,474430,00.html\"> Wanted: director with taste for adventure</a> Michael Billington on Nunn's legacy</p> <p><b>Comment 07.04.01</b> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/saturday_review/story/0,3605,469446,00.html\"> Passion?

Nunn, 61, who has long insisted that he would not be hounded out of one of the toughest jobs in theatre and would outlast his critics, could go by September next year. In a low-key statement slipped out over Easter, the National's board announced that Nunn was \"not seeking reappointment\". The statement continued: \"Even so, he has generously agreed to stay in post until a successor is ready to take over ... He has, by his leadership and example, enhanced the reputation of the National Theatre and upheld the standards established by his predecessors, Laurence Olivier, Peter Hall and Richard Eyre.\" Nunn refused to comment. His four-year tenure of the National's brutalist bunker on the South Bank has been attacked for its \"drift and muddle\" and has been characterised by what one critic called a \"saturation diet of musicals\". Major achievements such as the amazing ensemble of actors he has put together, and greatly increased touring, have been obscured by the flak Nunn has attracted for eschewing the radical new work many believe the National was set up to perform in favour of such \"safe\" bets as his revival of Oklahoma!. Anti-Nunn opinion was further inflamed by the cut he took from the musical's lucrative transfer to the West End. Unlike his predecessor, Sir Richard Eyre, whose fee from transferred productions such as Guys and Dolls was capped at a low level, Nunn's is not limited, although he cannot earn more than the National itself. The precise nature of his contract with the theatre, however, is confidential. His bank balance will be further enhanced by a planned Broadway run of Oklahoma! and Nunn is also likely to make up to \u00a31m when his sell-out production of My Fair Lady moves to the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane in July in another of the tie-ups with the impresario Cameron Mackintosh which has so angered some of his peers. Joint ventures Two years ago Nunn was estimated to be worth more than \u00a343m by the Sunday Times rich list, mainly from his joint ventures with Andrew Lloyd Webber on the musicals Cats and Les Miserables. His personal fortune has risen sharply since then, though his National salary brings in a comparatively modest \u00a3120,000 a year. Sir Christopher Hogg, the National's chairman, however, had no such qualms about dallying with the commercial sector and claimed that even with its \u00a313m grant, subsidy covered only 36% of their overheads as against more than 60% in the past. \"One should be so lucky to have a public-private partnership in which you enlist well below market cost the services of someone of the class of Trevor.\" He also pointed to the success of such outwardly uncommercial plays as Michael Frayn's Copenhagen - about the ethics of scientists building nuclear weapons - and Joe Penhall's Blue/Orange - about schizophrenia - during Nunn's reign After two gilded decades at the Royal Shakespeare Company, Nunn felt he was \"doing the National a favour\" by taking over from Sir Richard Eyre when no suitable replacement for him could be found in 1997. He has made no secret of the fact that his wife, the actor Imogen Stubbs, was not happy he had taken on \"the nightmare\" that comes with having to fill 2,500 seats in three different auditoriums every night. Worn down eventually by the constant sniping, Nunn is believed to have made the decision to bow to the inevitable at the end of last year and since then Sir Christopher has been lunching a long line of likely candidates including Nicholas Hytner, another director with an impressive commercial pedigree. With no heirs apparent waiting in the wings - another of the many accusations levelled at Nunn was that he acted like a \"one-man band\" - the race for his replacement is probably the most open in the National's history. Although his Oscar-nomination for his debut film Billy Elliot has brought Hollywood to his door, Stephen Daldry, the mercurial former director of the Royal Court, now in the final stages of filming his second film, The Hours, is seen by many as the best chance of the reviving the institution's radical spirit. At 39, and with an impressive track record of combining edgier new writing and canny, yet politically relevant West End hits like An Inspector Calls, he has been playing his cards close to his chest. When asked by the Guardian recently if he would take the job, the normally forthright Daldry demurred. \"Ask me anything but that. It's more than my life's worth to say anything about that,\" was his reply. Dream team A dream team of Daldry and Sam Mendes, the Oscar-winning director of American Beauty, who runs the Donmar Warehouse, has long been mooted, though with both now combining theatre and film, it looks highly unlikely. A strong head of steam, however, has been building up behind Jude Kelly, the artistic director of West Yorkshire Playhouse, who is believed to have the vocal backing on the National's board from Booker Prize-winning novelist Ben Okri, whose play she will soon stage, and the black academic Lola Young. As well as her proven track record, Kelly would have the added appeal of being the first ever woman to run the National Theatre. Whatever he does after his \"retirement\", Nunn will not be short of a few bob. For his final year at the National he is directing another musical, South Pacific, A Streetcar Named Desire starring Glenn Close and a new trilogy of plays by Tom Stoppard. All have a huge potential for commercial transfer, which he stands poised to benefit from.

And that, of course, was the point.</p> <p>As the peak period of summer travel looms, Britain yesterday began its campaign to rebuild a foreign tourist market dented by the foot and mouth crisis. Over the next few days - on private jets, chartered boats and air-conditioned coaches - representatives from the UK's top 10 overseas markets will be wooed with the message that Britain is open. Winning them over is the first step in preventing the collapse of an industry worth seven times more to the economy than farming.</p> <p>The campaign began yesterday on the shores of Loch Ness as the first group of tourist chiefs sailed down the loch to the ruins of Urquhart castle.</p> <p>The image was classically Scottish, but it had other, more contemporary, pictures with which to contend. News footage of Britain's burning pyres, soldiers burying corpses, and JCBs gathering carcasses have been beamed around the world for months now.</p> <p>American viewers, in particular, have been shocked by what they have watched. \"We are getting an image of thousands of animals being slaughtered on our screens, and of men in flak jackets, like military commandos, with huge machines burying carcasses,\" said Richard Copland, president of the American Society of Travel Agents.</p> <p>The British tourism authority estimates that overseas visitors contribute \u00a313bn to the UK economy each year. Cancellations due to foot and mouth are expected to cost \u00a32.5bn this year.</p> <p>Already, thousands of Americans have cancelled their trips. Brian Stack, vice chairman of the US Tour Operators Association, estimated that 100,000 of the 4m Americans who would normally visit the UK would cancel their holidays this year - many through a misconception.</p> <p>\"Their attention span is not huge, and all they know is there's a problem: they see lines of burning animals on the TV, and are simply afraid to come,\" said Mr Stack.</p> <p>Like their American counterparts, many Japanese have cancelled their UK trips because they have confused foot and mouth with BSE. They mistakenly believe they can become infected with a brain wasting condition by eating meat from animals infected by foot and mouth.</p> <p>Koji Shinmachi, managing director of the Japan Association of Travel Agents, estimated that at least 20% of the 600,000 Japanese who visited Britain every year would cancel because of foot and mouth.</p> <p>\"Some in Japan are very concerned about this, because they think that foot and mouth is the same as mad cow disease,\" said Mr Shinmachi.</p> <p>The campaign to win back overseas visitors will be difficult, but one in four jobs created in the UK in the past 10 years is in tourism and related fields, and no expense has been spared in courting the delegates. From the shores of Drumnadrochit to the moors of Dartmoor their business will be solicited by everyone from hotel keepers to Prince Philip and Tony Blair.</p> <p>\"At the end of this trip these people will, in effect, become tourism ambassadors for Britain,\" said Jeff Hamblin, chief executive of the British tourist authority.</p> <p><b>Email update</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/email\">Sign up for our free daily foot and mouth round-up</a><br><br><b>More on the election and foot and mouth</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/footandmouth\">Politics: foot and mouth</a></p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/list\">Full list: outbreaks </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,464555,00.html\">Graph: rise in cases</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,460510,00.html\">Full list: closed &amp; cancelled</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\">Causes and effects</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/theissues/article/0,6512,441031,00.html\">The issue explained</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,471911,00.html\">11.04.2001: Foot and mouth in Europe</a></p> <p><b>The front line: meet those affected by the crisis</b><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,467836,00.html\">03.04.2001: Straws in the wind</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html\">06.03.2001: Meet our panel</a><br> <br></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,474030,00.html\">17.04.2001: Safety code paves way for vaccine</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,474026,00.html\">17.04.2001: Ulster in fear after third case</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,473997,00.html\">17.04.2001: Supermarkets boost case for vaccination</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,474029,00.html\">17.04.2001: Barclays offers aid to farmers in crisis </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,473955,00.html\">17.04.2001, Comment: Slaughter is still the best medicine</a><br></p> <p><b>Interactive guides</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/flash/0,7365,443772,00.html\">How the virus spread across Britain</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/country/flash/0,6189,191473,00.html\">The countryside in crisis</a></p> <p><b>More on the countryside in crisis</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463746,00.html\">27.03.2001: Hard times</a></p> <p><b>From the Guardian archive</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463588,00.html\">28.11.1967, leader: indecision on foot and mouth</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463571,00.html\">18.11.1967: 'Slaughter must seem a cruel remedy'</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463578,00.html\"> 16.11.1967: Foot and mouth may cost agriculture more than \u00a312m</a></p> <p><b>Graphics</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,443231,00.html\">Map: The spread of the disease (week 4)</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,443231,00.html\">Map of confirmed cases so far</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,441929,00.html\">Computerised image of the virus</a><br></p> <p><b>Cartoons</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,464422,00.html\">Steve Bell on how pigs will fly</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,463874,00.html\">Steve Bell on Hague going over the top</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,443237,00.html\">The story in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br> <a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7f681\">What do you think?</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth\">Foot and mouth</a><br> <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/footandmouth/\">Election 2001: foot and mouth</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/food/\">What's wrong with our food?</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/bse/\">BSE</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/country/0,2759,181093,00.html\">Countryside in crisis</a></p> <p><b>Net notes</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/netnotes/article/0,6729,440983,00.html\">Pigs -

      "bodyText": "The mist, this time, was a welcome sight - not a dense screen of smoke from funeral pyres, but the romantic drape of a rainy spring in the Highlands. It was finally an image of Britain to entice not deter foreign tourists. And that, of course, was the point. As the peak period of summer travel looms, Britain yesterday began its campaign to rebuild a foreign tourist market dented by the foot and mouth crisis. Over the next few days - on private jets, chartered boats and air-conditioned coaches - representatives from the UK's top 10 overseas markets will be wooed with the message that Britain is open. Winning them over is the first step in preventing the collapse of an industry worth seven times more to the economy than farming. The campaign began yesterday on the shores of Loch Ness as the first group of tourist chiefs sailed down the loch to the ruins of Urquhart castle. The image was classically Scottish, but it had other, more contemporary, pictures with which to contend. News footage of Britain's burning pyres, soldiers burying corpses, and JCBs gathering carcasses have been beamed around the world for months now. American viewers, in particular, have been shocked by what they have watched. \"We are getting an image of thousands of animals being slaughtered on our screens, and of men in flak jackets, like military commandos, with huge machines burying carcasses,\" said Richard Copland, president of the American Society of Travel Agents. The British tourism authority estimates that overseas visitors contribute \u00a313bn to the UK economy each year. Cancellations due to foot and mouth are expected to cost \u00a32.5bn this year. Already, thousands of Americans have cancelled their trips. Brian Stack, vice chairman of the US Tour Operators Association, estimated that 100,000 of the 4m Americans who would normally visit the UK would cancel their holidays this year - many through a misconception. \"Their attention span is not huge, and all they know is there's a problem: they see lines of burning animals on the TV, and are simply afraid to come,\" said Mr Stack.

      "bodyText": "The income gap between rich and poor is continuing to widen under Labour and last year outstripped even the highest inequality mark under the Conservatives, according to government figures. Data from the office for national statistics, published yesterday, shows that the standard measure of inequality increased in 1999/2000 beyond its previous high water mark under John Major's administration in 1991. In a further blow to the government's claims to be tackling poverty, the figures, from the annual Family Expenditure survey, also reveal that the poorest households are paying a higher proportion of income in tax than the richest. The government last night faced strong criticism from the Liberal Democrats, who accused ministers of hitting the poor hardest by raising indirect taxes rather than direct taxation. Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman Ed Davey said: \"By copying Conservative policies of raising indirect taxes whilst cutting fair taxes like income tax, Labour have hit society's poorest. \"Liberal Democrats recognise that schools, hospitals and police need more investment, but we believe that the burden should be paid for in fair taxation.\" Shadow chancellor Michael Portillo claimed that the statistics showed poorer people were taking the brunt of Labour \"stealth taxes\". \"These figures confirm that Gordon Brown has hit the poorest hardest,\" said Mr Portillo. \"Labour chancellors used to boast of taxing the rich, but Gordon Brown has increased the taxes that everyone has to pay. His stealth taxes on petrol, mortgages, marriage and cigarettes have hit the least well off. \"Labour's stealth taxes mean that the least well off are seeing the largest share of their income being taken by the taxman. \"Conservatives disagree with Labour's view that every pound spent by the government is spent wisely and morally, while the same pound spent by an individual is spent selfishly and immorally. \"We have a positive alternative for a more prosperous society, that involves cutting taxes and leaving people with more of their own money, allowing them to be more independent and enjoy more self-esteem.\" Tobacco duty is cited by the office for national statistics as one of the indirect taxes which disproportionately hits those on lowest incomes. It represents 4.9% of disposable income of the poorest fifth of households, and just 0.5% for the top fifth. According to the office's figures, the Gini coefficient - a complicated mathematical formula used to measure inequality - shows that the gap in incomes after tax between rich and poor has increased to 40, on a scale where zero represents universal equality of income. In 1998/9, that figure was 39 - itself a new peak since 1991 - and 38 in 1997/98, Labour's first year in office. The office says one reason for the trend is the growth in the importance of income from self-employment, which is much more unequal than earnings among employees. The statistics also show that somebody in the poorest fifth of households typically pays 41.4% of their overall income in tax compared with 36.5% for the richest fifth. In a trend which exposes the government further to Tory and Liberal Democrat accusations of relying on stealth taxes rather than direct taxation, the proportion of income paid in tax has risen for the bottom 80% of households since 1997/8 and fallen for the richest fifth of households. The share of all UK household income received by the poor has steadily decreased since 1981 - when data was first gathered on the current basis, with a fresh fall under Labour after a seven year plateau, the figures show. The poorest fifth of households had 6% of national income after tax, while the share held by the top fifth has risen under Labour from 44% to 45%.",

      "body": "<p>Digital television gets another kickstart this week with the government announcing a pilot to test how a universal switch-over could work. A thousand households will get free digital boxes with internet access. Every viewing moment will be monitored to find out what people watch, whether they buy extra paid-for channels, how much they use the internet and email, whether they shop on the box and if they like what they see.</p> <p>The government has a high-flown line about keeping Britain in the vanguard of the communications revolution (which it is), and the importance of plugging every household into the internet (why not?). But the urgent reason is the fat plum of up to \u00a320bn that waits to be plucked by whichever government is in power when the old analogue system is turned off and sold. The earliest date officially mooted is 2006. But sooner would be better if people can be urged or paid to switch, so that this money cascades into Labour-controlled coffers. Can it be done?</p> <p>So far a quarter of households have gone digital. Media analysts expect 65% will go digital by 2006. But that still leaves 35% who say they won't. They don't want more channels, they don't understand interactive or email and they don't want to shop on television. Half of those aged over 49 are in this refusenik group. How can they be pushed? Eventually many of the poor and the obstinate will be given free digital equipment, a price worth paying given the handsome reward the government will reap, but naturally the government hopes to seduce as many as possible to switch over of their own accord.</p> <p>The trouble is that digital boxes and dishes have a downmarket, shell-suit image. Young, brash, vulgar, sports-pub, Sun-reading, Murdoch-tainted, digital TV just does not have class. Those in the burgeoning middle classes who are not sports fans have too little reason to switch. Their children may demand it but otherwise, says Mathew Horsman, a media analyst, \"My granny in Bournemouth just won't.\" They don't want to pay and they are not yet enticed by the free channels, despite the excellence of some such as BBC News 24. (Digital sellers deliberately avoid promoting the option to buy only free channels.) Unfortunately it is the plethora of awful free channels that gives digital its low reputation - those timeless zones of wall-to-wall cookery or quizzes from the 1970s drifting through the digital universe like space litter: try Breeze Men and Motors or Granada Plus for a taste of the eye-achingly terrible.</p> <p>This is where hopes are now pinned on the BBC. Can it change the image of digital with high-quality channels to tempt the refuseniks? It has put in a bid to Chris Smith to launch four new free services - two daytime children's channels, one for the very young, one for older children, BBC3 for young people and BBC4 for arts, ideas and culture. BBC4 is the crucial channel. Its prospectus promises it will be \"the home of culture, the arts, ideas and serious debate\", with live performances (the whole of the Proms, for example), world cinema, \"thought-provoking documentaries\" and \"in-depth debate around the key issues of the day\", exploring \"the thinkers, performers and writers driving today's cultural society\".</p> <p>But do they mean it? Will it be allowed to have a small audience? Will it escape the curse of having to make everything difficult \"accessible\"? It will test whether the BBC still has enough nerve to declare its own standards and stick to them. BBC1 and 2 are almost entirely populist and ratings-chasing now. That doesn't mean many of its programmes aren't very good, but they are only allowed to exist if they aim to pull off the magic trick of being both good and widely popular. Some subjects simply can't be both. The original promise of the digital future was that it could provide niche channels for every taste and enthusiasm. So far in a sea of cheap and cheerless channels, bar a few gems, that hasn't happened.</p> <p>BBC4 needs the cultural weight to capture the same kind of devoted adherence as Radio 3 and 4: just consider how these very small radio listenerships fill the air and letters pages with protest at any minor change to the schedules. BBC4 needs to raise the tone and reputation of digital television to such a high-brow pitch that the sort of people who like to boast smugly \"we never watch the box\" start boasting loudly about last night's viewing. Posh TV is what will drive the digital future. In a world where one in three young people are graduates, the future is up-market.</p> <p>But BBC3 is another story: it looks like a turkey before it even gets off the page. The word is that Chris Smith may refuse it and he would be right. Its prospectus threatens: \"The service would be targeted at the younger viewer and would reflect the lifestyles and attitudes at the young heart of today's multicultural UK.\" It promises \"gripping entertainment, new comedy and compelling drama\". But what for? If there is money to spare for \"gripping drama\" then spend it on BBC1 and 2. A bit more cultural bravery would have saved those channels from recent disasters such as the insipid Love in a Cold Climate, Adrian Mole, Take a Girl Like You - all supposedly popular and \"safe\" ideas that deserved to bomb. There is no shortage of stuff for the young. \"Young\", like \"accessible\", is mainly code for dumb, (to the rage of the young who are not dumb). Saga TV is a better bet for getting older refuseniks to switch. Or a specialist channel for enthusiasms and peculiarities uncatered for elsewhere.</p> <p>However, the BBC children's channels will convert many households: half of those with children have already switched, and high-quality BBC children's programmes with no advertising or cartoons will be a winner. The part-Murdoch-owned Nickelodeon children's channel has put in a strong objection, on the usual Murdoch grounds that the BBC should never offer popular services competing with commercial television. Most observers think Smith will approve these channels, but he hesitates interminably. The plans have been out to consultation, but still he sits on them. There will probably be no decision before the election (the government may not wish to upset Murdoch just now). If Smith is moved after the election, a new arts minister might want to make their own decision, taking yet longer. It then has to go to Europe for approval as a state-aided enterprise, and that takes another three months. So the hope of launching new channels with a blaze of publicity in the autumn has died.</p> <p>This will be a sharp test for the BBC and Greg Dyke. So far his reign has been characterised by ratings wars, pressure to turn science and history into entertainment, the serious squeezed out in favour of frivolity wherever there is a choice, the news more strident and less analytical. Now BBC4 has to dare to be what it promises - a new Olympian benchmark.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:&quot;polly.toynbee@theguardian.com&quot;\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",

There is no shortage of stuff for the young. \"Young\", like \"accessible\", is mainly code for dumb, (to the rage of the young who are not dumb). Saga TV is a better bet for getting older refuseniks to switch. Or a specialist channel for enthusiasms and peculiarities uncatered for elsewhere. However, the BBC children's channels will convert many households: half of those with children have already switched, and high-quality BBC children's programmes with no advertising or cartoons will be a winner. The part-Murdoch-owned Nickelodeon children's channel has put in a strong objection, on the usual Murdoch grounds that the BBC should never offer popular services competing with commercial television. Most observers think Smith will approve these channels, but he hesitates interminably. The plans have been out to consultation, but still he sits on them. There will probably be no decision before the election (the government may not wish to upset Murdoch just now). If Smith is moved after the election, a new arts minister might want to make their own decision, taking yet longer. It then has to go to Europe for approval as a state-aided enterprise, and that takes another three months. So the hope of launching new channels with a blaze of publicity in the autumn has died. This will be a sharp test for the BBC and Greg Dyke. So far his reign has been characterised by ratings wars, pressure to turn science and history into entertainment, the serious squeezed out in favour of frivolity wherever there is a choice, the news more strident and less analytical. Now BBC4 has to dare to be what it promises - a new Olympian benchmark. polly.toynbee@theguardian.com",

Farmers say the number of new foot and mouth cases is only decreasing there, simply because there are hardly any animals left. Epidemiologists predict that 85% of north Cumbria's livestock will be wiped out in the cull.</p> <p>Plans to vaccinate come at a time when farmers say they have their \"backs to the barn wall\". They risk dented sales of vaccinated beef and milk, or seeing every animal culled.</p> <p>Last night, Cumbrian farmers were divided on vaccination. Cattle were locked in barns, costing around \u00a31,000 a week of uninfected Scottish silage and hay feed, when cattle would normally be outside grazing free at this time of year.</p> <p>The government's chief scientific advisor, David King, said vaccination would protect cattle due to be turned out of barns this week and increase the number of animals left in Cumbria. But local farmers call it the \"experiment\", saying Cumbria is \"guinea pig land\".</p> <p>Local NFU leaders said half the farmers were for vaccination and half were against. Pedigree cattle specialists were largely anti-vaccination and those most in favour wanted a promise of government compensation if sales were affected in the future.</p> <p>Peter Vasey, 54, a breeder of pedigree Charolais cattle, had spent the last two months on his farm with his wife, scared if he left he would bring back the disease and infect his 120 cattle. He said his experience contradicted Prof King's reasoning for vaccination: that cattle ran twice the risk if allowed on to fields.</p> <p>Mr Vasey farms in an infected zone. A neighbour has foot and mouth and in a field adjacent to Mr Vasey's property sheep have been slaughtered and carcasses left on the ground for 10 days.</p> <p>Yet Mr Vasey's pedigree breeding cattle have been out in fields since winter and have not contracted the disease. \"I do not believe it when they say cattle outside are at more risk from foot and mouth,\" he said.</p> <p>\"I am very much against vaccination. It is going to make foot and mouth endemic here. We are never going to get rid of the disease. If my cattle were vaccinated, the only option I would have would be slaughter because I would have no way of selling them.\"</p> <p>Mr Vasey's breeding bulls would sell for around \u00a36,000. Customers have told him they will not buy vaccinated stock.</p> <p>Harold Armstrong, a dairy farmer from Bromfield, was one of the many who yesterday changed his mind to take a positive attitude to vaccination. He has 400 dairy cows in an infected zone.</p> <p>There have been three outbreaks on nearby farms in the last two days - the nearest was two miles away. He has already voluntarily surrendered his healthy sheep to the precautionary cull.</p> <p>\"I have come round to thinking it is maybe our only option. But we must have promises about the sale of the milk and meat. My milk goes to make powder for export. We are already having problems getting it out of the country.</p> <p>\"I wouldn't like to think vaccination would stop my neighbours restocking. And we want guarantees that vaccinated cattle are tested and don't all have to be slaughtered in a year.\"</p> <p>In the north Lake District, Will Cockbain, a pedigree sheep and beef farmer and deputy county chairman of the NFU, suggested farmers had been left to form opinions on vaccination without information.</p> <p>\"People haven't been aware of all the facts until now.

      "bodyText": "Miles of empty fields line the proposed vaccination zone in north Cumbria. The sheep are dead and the cattle are locked in barns. Farmers say the number of new foot and mouth cases is only decreasing there, simply because there are hardly any animals left. Epidemiologists predict that 85% of north Cumbria's livestock will be wiped out in the cull. Plans to vaccinate come at a time when farmers say they have their \"backs to the barn wall\". They risk dented sales of vaccinated beef and milk, or seeing every animal culled. Last night, Cumbrian farmers were divided on vaccination. Cattle were locked in barns, costing around \u00a31,000 a week of uninfected Scottish silage and hay feed, when cattle would normally be outside grazing free at this time of year. The government's chief scientific advisor, David King, said vaccination would protect cattle due to be turned out of barns this week and increase the number of animals left in Cumbria. But local farmers call it the \"experiment\", saying Cumbria is \"guinea pig land\". Local NFU leaders said half the farmers were for vaccination and half were against. Pedigree cattle specialists were largely anti-vaccination and those most in favour wanted a promise of government compensation if sales were affected in the future. Peter Vasey, 54, a breeder of pedigree Charolais cattle, had spent the last two months on his farm with his wife, scared if he left he would bring back the disease and infect his 120 cattle. He said his experience contradicted Prof King's reasoning for vaccination: that cattle ran twice the risk if allowed on to fields. Mr Vasey farms in an infected zone. A neighbour has foot and mouth and in a field adjacent to Mr Vasey's property sheep have been slaughtered and carcasses left on the ground for 10 days. Yet Mr Vasey's pedigree breeding cattle have been out in fields since winter and have not contracted the disease. \"I do not believe it when they say cattle outside are at more risk from foot and mouth,\" he said. \"I am very much against vaccination. It is going to make foot and mouth endemic here. We are never going to get rid of the disease. If my cattle were vaccinated, the only option I would have would be slaughter because I would have no way of selling them.\" Mr Vasey's breeding bulls would sell for around \u00a36,000. Customers have told him they will not buy vaccinated stock. Harold Armstrong, a dairy farmer from Bromfield, was one of the many who yesterday changed his mind to take a positive attitude to vaccination. He has 400 dairy cows in an infected zone. There have been three outbreaks on nearby farms in the last two days - the nearest was two miles away. He has already voluntarily surrendered his healthy sheep to the precautionary cull. \"I have come round to thinking it is maybe our only option. But we must have promises about the sale of the milk and meat. My milk goes to make powder for export. We are already having problems getting it out of the country. \"I wouldn't like to think vaccination would stop my neighbours restocking. And we want guarantees that vaccinated cattle are tested and don't all have to be slaughtered in a year.\" In the north Lake District, Will Cockbain, a pedigree sheep and beef farmer and deputy county chairman of the NFU, suggested farmers had been left to form opinions on vaccination without information. \"People haven't been aware of all the facts until now. There is a lot of scepticism, but vaccination is a step in the right direction. If the facts are made available, I think the majority of farmers would go with it.\" Farmers agreed on one thing: the desperation that shapes their attitude to any new policy at this stage.

      "body": "<p>The prime minister has failed to convince the National Farmers' Union that vaccination is a sensible way of tackling the foot and mouth epidemic and is considering whether he should force the issue.</p> <p>The government is embarrassed as it loses ground in the battle to dispose of carcasses and slaughter animals which might have been in contact with the disease.</p> <p>There are 431,000 carcasses remaining unburied and 568,000 animals still to be killed.</p> <p>With the number of new cases still running at more than 20 a day, and the total number of outbreaks reaching 1,365 yesterday, vaccination was becoming an increasingly attractive option for Tony Blair.</p> <p>Last night a statement from Downing Street confirmed that the chief scientist, David King, and the chief vet, Jim Scudamore, supported limited vaccination of cattle in Cumbria and Devon, but said the government would not begin without the consent of \"deeply divided\" farmers.</p> <p>A Downing Street spokesman said vaccination would be a \"supplement\" to the current culling policy.</p> <p>But he said the experts had cautioned ministers that vaccination would only be effective if it had \"very substantial\" support from farmers. There were also some \"very difficult consumer issues to be addressed\".</p> <p>\"It is quite clear from the discussions so far that the support from farmers is not currently there, and that the farming community as a whole is deeply divided on the issue,\" he said.</p> <p>The government has the power to kill animals to contain the disease, but not to vaccinate compulsorily. Consent is required from every farmer, and unless there is blanket vaccination of cattle in Cumbria and Devon the policy is unlikely to be effective.</p> <p>The government would need legislation to force farmers to comply.</p> <p>Last night the NFU remained unconvinced that the government had answers to its questions about vaccination. Its main query is whether inoculation would prolong the epidemic and delay the resumption of exports. The union still favours the government's original eradication policy.</p> <p>The farmers also want compensation if they are unable to sell meat and milk from vaccinated animals, saying assurance that there is no public health risk is not enough.</p> <p>Martin Howarth, the NFU's policy director, said: \"It seems to us an ineffective strategy, we remain to be convinced by the scientific evidence that vaccination will make a difference to the course of the epidemic.\"</p> <p>The government ran into more flak yesterday from Dirk Hazell, chief executive of the environmental services association, charged with burying carcasses of culled cattle up to six years old, which might be contaminated with BSE.</p> <p>Although the government denies there is any danger to the public it refuses to indemnify the landfill site owners if in the future people contract BSE as a result of this emergency dumping measure.</p> <p>Mr Hazell said: \"Until this crisis it was against the law to dump carcasses over 30 months, now suddenly there is no danger. If that is the case then indemnify us. So far we have no guarantee and we are not happy.\"</p> <p>Sir John Krebs, chairman of the food standards agency, last night said he had advised Maff that meat and dairy products from vaccinated livestock could safely enter the food chain with no harmful effect on humans.</p> <p>He said there were already 33 vaccines commonly used in Britain to prevent livestock contracting common conditions as diverse as digestive diseases and fevers.</p> <p>\"Our message on vaccination is that milk or meat from vaccinated animals would not constitute a food safety risk,\" said Sir John.</p> <p><b>Email update</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/email\">Sign up for our free daily foot and mouth round-up</a><br><br><b>More on the election and foot and mouth</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/footandmouth\">Politics: foot and mouth</a></p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/list\">Full list: outbreaks </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,464555,00.html\">Graph: rise in cases</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,460510,00.html\">Full list: closed &amp; cancelled</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\">Causes and effects</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/theissues/article/0,6512,441031,00.html\">The issue explained</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,471911,00.html\">11.04.2001: Foot and mouth in Europe</a></p> <p><b>The front line: meet those affected by the crisis</b><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,467836,00.html\">03.04.2001: Straws in the wind</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html\">06.03.2001: Meet our panel</a><br> <br></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,474030,00.html\">17.04.2001: Safety code paves way for vaccine</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,474026,00.html\">17.04.2001: Ulster in fear after third case</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,473997,00.html\">17.04.2001: Supermarkets boost case for vaccination</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,474029,00.html\">17.04.2001: Barclays offers aid to farmers in crisis </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,473955,00.html\">17.04.2001, Comment: Slaughter is still the best medicine</a><br></p> <p><b>Interactive guides</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/flash/0,7365,443772,00.html\">How the virus spread across Britain</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/country/flash/0,6189,191473,00.html\">The countryside in crisis</a></p> <p><b>More on the countryside in crisis</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463746,00.html\">27.03.2001: Hard times</a></p> <p><b>From the Guardian archive</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463588,00.html\">28.11.1967, leader: indecision on foot and mouth</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463571,00.html\">18.11.1967: 'Slaughter must seem a cruel remedy'</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463578,00.html\"> 16.11.1967: Foot and mouth may cost agriculture more than \u00a312m</a></p> <p><b>Graphics</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,443231,00.html\">Map: The spread of the disease (week 4)</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,443231,00.html\">Map of confirmed cases so far</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,441929,00.html\">Computerised image of the virus</a><br></p> <p><b>Cartoons</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,464422,00.html\">Steve Bell on how pigs will fly</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,463874,00.html\">Steve Bell on Hague going over the top</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,443237,00.html\">The story in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br> <a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7f681\">What do you think?</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth\">Foot and mouth</a><br> <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/footandmouth/\">Election 2001: foot and mouth</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/food/\">What's wrong with our food?</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/bse/\">BSE</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/country/0,2759,181093,00.html\">Countryside in crisis</a></p> <p><b>Net notes</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/netnotes/article/0,6729,440983,00.html\">Pigs -

The government is embarrassed as it loses ground in the battle to dispose of carcasses and slaughter animals which might have been in contact with the disease. There are 431,000 carcasses remaining unburied and 568,000 animals still to be killed. With the number of new cases still running at more than 20 a day, and the total number of outbreaks reaching 1,365 yesterday, vaccination was becoming an increasingly attractive option for Tony Blair. Last night a statement from Downing Street confirmed that the chief scientist, David King, and the chief vet, Jim Scudamore, supported limited vaccination of cattle in Cumbria and Devon, but said the government would not begin without the consent of \"deeply divided\" farmers. A Downing Street spokesman said vaccination would be a \"supplement\" to the current culling policy. But he said the experts had cautioned ministers that vaccination would only be effective if it had \"very substantial\" support from farmers. There were also some \"very difficult consumer issues to be addressed\". \"It is quite clear from the discussions so far that the support from farmers is not currently there, and that the farming community as a whole is deeply divided on the issue,\" he said. The government has the power to kill animals to contain the disease, but not to vaccinate compulsorily. Consent is required from every farmer, and unless there is blanket vaccination of cattle in Cumbria and Devon the policy is unlikely to be effective. The government would need legislation to force farmers to comply. Last night the NFU remained unconvinced that the government had answers to its questions about vaccination. Its main query is whether inoculation would prolong the epidemic and delay the resumption of exports. The union still favours the government's original eradication policy. The farmers also want compensation if they are unable to sell meat and milk from vaccinated animals, saying assurance that there is no public health risk is not enough. Martin Howarth, the NFU's policy director, said: \"It seems to us an ineffective strategy, we remain to be convinced by the scientific evidence that vaccination will make a difference to the course of the epidemic.\" The government ran into more flak yesterday from Dirk Hazell, chief executive of the environmental services association, charged with burying carcasses of culled cattle up to six years old, which might be contaminated with BSE. Although the government denies there is any danger to the public it refuses to indemnify the landfill site owners if in the future people contract BSE as a result of this emergency dumping measure. Mr Hazell said: \"Until this crisis it was against the law to dump carcasses over 30 months, now suddenly there is no danger. If that is the case then indemnify us. So far we have no guarantee and we are not happy.\" Sir John Krebs, chairman of the food standards agency, last night said he had advised Maff that meat and dairy products from vaccinated livestock could safely enter the food chain with no harmful effect on humans. He said there were already 33 vaccines commonly used in Britain to prevent livestock contracting common conditions as diverse as digestive diseases and fevers. \"Our message on vaccination is that milk or meat from vaccinated animals would not constitute a food safety risk,\" said Sir John.

      "bodyText": "A split emerged last night between the world's big pharmaceutical companies over whether to proceed today with a patent rights lawsuit against the South African government that has turned into an international public relations disaster. Three of the world's largest pharmaceutical firms - Britain's GlaxoSmithKline, and Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb in the US - broke ranks with 36 other companies who are party to the attempt to overturn a South African law that permits the government to import generic and other cheaper drugs to deal with health emergencies or where patented medicines are too expensive. Last night the firms were negotiating with the South African government to reach a settlement before the Pretoria high court hearing resumes today after a six-week adjournment. At the weekend, Nelson Mandela joined widespread international condemnation of the pharmaceutical companies' lawsuit by denouncing it as \"a gross error\". \"They are exploiting the situation in the developing world, because they charge exorbitant prices,\" he said. \"This is completely wrong and must be condemned.\" But Mr Mandela also said that the case could be settled through negotiation and said the South African government must \"take responsibility for not doing sufficient work\". Sources close to the case said the breakaway drug companies were keen to withdraw from the lawsuit but were unable to see a way out without making concessions they are concerned could influence other countries following South Africa's lead. The firms are particularly worried that a legal precedent might be established, allowing governments to declare individual drugs as too expensive and patents to be overridden worldwide. If an agreement can be reached between South Africa and the three drugs manufacturers, it would exert enormous pressure on the other firms to pull out of the lawsuit and prove an important moral and legal victory for campaigners for wider access to anti-Aids drugs. But the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PMA), in whose name the legal challenge was filed, said it would continue the action even if only a handful of drug companies wanted to do so.

Voters rejected suggestions from the US state's governor and business leaders that a new flag would help the southern state escape its segregationist past. With all ballots from yesterday's poll counted, 488,630 voters, or 65%, favoured keeping the old flag and 267,812 voters, or 35%, wanted to replace it. Mississippi is the last state to prominently display the emblem on its flag. Governor Ronnie Musgrove said Mississippi should accept the results. \"We must put aside our differences as we continue to create a state that provides a good quality of life for our people,\" he said. In a state where William Faulkner said the past is never dead, the flag debate, while largely peaceful, polarised voters along racial lines. In DeSoto County, a predominantly white county in the Memphis suburbs, the old flag led by a six-to-one margin. In Hinds County, the majority-black county that includes Jackson, two out of three people backed the new flag. Voters had two choices: keep the current 1894 flag with the Confederate emblem of 13 white stars on a blue X, or adopt a new flag with 20 white stars on a blue square, denoting Mississippi's role as the 20th state. Farmer Terry Galey voted to keep the old banner. \"I've had things on my farm that have been working for 20 years and if they're still working, why change them?\" he said yesterday.

Mississippi's only black congressman, Democrat Bennie Thompson, has refused to fly the flag in his Washington office. \"We will now have the sole distinction of having a Confederate battle symbol on a flag that can only further divide a diverse population,\" he said. Some white people said they support the old flag because it represents their heritage and was the banner they saluted as children. Many black people see the emblem as a symbol of past injustices, including beatings and lynchings by the Ku Klux Klan. The state, with 2.8m people, is 61% white and 36% black. Mr Musgrove and many business leaders supported the new flag, saying it would help move the state forward economically and socially. The debate arose after the Mississippi supreme court ruled last May that the state technically has no flag, because the 1894 design was left out when the state code was updated in 1906. The legislature decided to let the voters choose. The vote is part of a larger debate across the south about dealing with past racism and facing the future. In neighbouring Alabama, jury selection is under way in the trial of a white man accused in one of the civil rights era's most notorious crimes, the 1963 bombing of Birmingham's Sixteenth Street Baptist Church. The bombing killed four black girls. In recent years, prosecutors in Mississippi and other states also have dusted off files on old civil rights cases.

      "bodyText": "A doctor believed to have swindled \u00a34m from hospitals was yesterday convicted of the biggest one-man fraud of the NHS. Dimitri Padelis, 45, of South Norwood in south London, ran a company placing locum medical staff at hospitals and defrauded the health service by billing hospitals twice, inflating the number of hours doctors had worked and submitting bogus expenses. Among the hardest hit was the Great Ormond Street children's hospital in London, which lost more than \u00a312,000. Padelis was convicted of two counts of fraudulent trading and three of false accounting between 1991 and 1995, at Southwark crown court in London yesterday. The case was adjourned until May 25 for pre-sentence reports and Padelis was released on bail. Anthony Leonard QC, prosecuting, told the jury it had been a subtle and widespread fraud. \"At its heart was the notion that so long as he kept the overcharging to an insignificant level on each invoice or in respect of each trust - a philosophy of a little bit here and a little bit there - the fraud would go unnoticed. \"But for a chance discovery, goodness knows how long it could have run.\" Prosecution counsel said it was impossible to be certain about how much money had been lost to the NHS. Although the case was conducted on the basis that Padelis had stolen at least \u00a3340,000, an investigating accountant who studied his pattern of offending estimated that he had pocketed as much as \u00a32m, and later warned it was possible that the amount could be twice that. One investigator said: \"We have no doubt this man was responsible for one of the biggest frauds on the NHS and almost certainly the largest committed by a single individual. \"He was a secret cancer infecting just about every hospital he dealt with. \"No one will ever know just how much unnecessary suffering he was responsible for.\" Alarm bells began to ring when an audit manager checked the 1994-95 accounts for Gwynedd hospital trust in north Wales and noticed that a series of payments for the same amount of money had been paid to the same company, Allcare. Police were alerted and a mass of incriminating documents were found at Padelis's home and office. All 458 NHS trusts in Britain were asked if they had dealt with Padelis's agency - detectives were surprised when thousands of documents flooded in. Because resources were limited, a sample 77 trusts were chosen, although as time passed it became clear that a prosecution even on this basis would prove unmanageable for a jury. So it was scaled back to 25, and then to just 12 including Great Ormond Street, Walsgrave hospital in Coventry, and Manchester children's hospital. Padelis paid back the money he had swindled from the trusts that formed the basis of the police investigation. In his defence he accused hospital administrators of \"universal incompetence\" and said trusts had \"consistently made casual and indifferent mistakes\". Outside court Jim Gee, head of the NHS directorate of counter fraud services, said: \"Fraud against the NHS is not a victimless crime, but one that is draining the lifeblood from necessary treatment for patients. \"Quite simply, the more we can protect public money, the easier it will be to keep the public healthy and make society a better place.\" He added: \"Every pound lost to fraud is a pound not spent on public care. The public has a right to expect that the NHS is protected.\"",

The management of Sem Dnei recently stopped supporting Mr Gusinsky and allied itself with Gazprom Media, the division which orchestrated the takeover of NTV, establishing a controlling stake in the publications.</p> <p>The magazine's sister daily, Sevodnya, was absent from the newsstands yesterday for the first time in its eight-year history. Sem Dnei closed it on Monday night, 40 minutes before Tuesday's edition was due to go to press. The staff were ordered to take two months' paid leave and the editor-in-chief was sacked.</p> <p>Sevodnya and Itogi are among Russia's best-respected publications, although Mr Gusinsky has in the past used them to voice his opinions.

      "bodyText": "The battle for control of Russia's opposition media continued yesterday with the closure of a prominent independent daily newspaper and the apparent dismissal of the editorial staff of an influential weekly political magazine. Both publications were partly owned by the exiled media magnate Vladimir Gusinsky, whose Media-Most empire is gradually crumbling under pressure from the state gas monopoly, Gazprom. The staff of the magazine Itogi arrived at work yesterday to find their newsroom barred by a row of private security guards: a scene reminiscent of Saturday's Gazprom takeover of Russia's only big independent television network, NTV. The editor, Sergei Parkhomenko, was sacked by the publishing house, Sem Dnei (Seven Days), and the rest of the editorial staff were forced to resign. The management of Sem Dnei recently stopped supporting Mr Gusinsky and allied itself with Gazprom Media, the division which orchestrated the takeover of NTV, establishing a controlling stake in the publications. The magazine's sister daily, Sevodnya, was absent from the newsstands yesterday for the first time in its eight-year history. Sem Dnei closed it on Monday night, 40 minutes before Tuesday's edition was due to go to press. The staff were ordered to take two months' paid leave and the editor-in-chief was sacked. Sevodnya and Itogi are among Russia's best-respected publications, although Mr Gusinsky has in the past used them to voice his opinions. Both have been aggressive in their criticism of President Vladimir Putin's government. Vladimir Biryukov, director and part-owner of Sem Dnei, said their political stance had nothing to do with the editorial changes. The decision to sack the editor of Sevodnya and suspend publication was made purely as a result of the paper's annual losses of $3m (\u00a32.1m), he said. \"As the director of the company I am concerned first of all about cash flow and profitability. I have always thought that unless we make the publication profitable it will have to go.\" The sacked Sevodnya editor, Mikhail Berger, said very few Russian broadsheets made money, because of the weak advertising market, and the only way serious newspapers could survive was by being adopted by publishing stables like Sem Dnei, which relied on profitable publications to subsidise their higher-profile papers. He said Mr Biryukov had \"performed a great service to the Kremlin by eliminating a critical paper\", and insisted that his dismissal was directly connected with a government-backed campaign to castrate NTV and seize control of opposition media. \"It is hard to say how directly Mr Putin has been involved in all these events, but I think it is clear that he feels a personal dislike for Mr Gusinsky, stemming from his belief that nobody has a right to criticise the president personally,\" he said. Mr Berger said that although freedom of the press remained alive, the crisis at Media-Most set a sobering example to other media groups. \"These events have served as a warning to news organisations, who have begun to adopt careful self-censorship, making sure they stick to the Kremlin mainstream view.\" Gazprom insists that it has stepped in simply to resolve the troubled finances at the heart of Media-Most. Sem Dnei plans to continue publishing Itogi, using an entirely new editorial team. Mr Parkhomenko, its sacked editor, said: \"Next week you will see a publication with the name Itogi printed on it, but the magazine will be produced by different people, according to different principles, and I suspect with different aims. The Itogi that has existed for the past five years no longer exists.\" Defiant NTV journalists who are refusing to work for the new management continued to broadcast a rebel version of the news yesterday from the studios of TNT, another of Mr Gusinsky's channels.",

These include the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (Nice), which ensures the best treatments are made widely available, and the Commission for Health Improvement (Chi), which reviews the quality of healthcare provided by the NHS through an inspection programme. What reforms are proposed? A consultation document, Best Practice - Best Care, published last week, sets out a framework for setting standards, strengthening accountability for the services delivered, and improving monitoring and regulation. How would standards be improved? First, the department proposes to introduce service development frameworks. These would cover the whole system of care for a particular service (for example, mental health) and provide a holistic approach to planning, delivery and monitoring of services. The frameworks would spell out where care is best provided, e.g. primary care, hospital or a specialist service; set the standard of care that patients should receive, and establish performance measures that would be used to check the quality of service provided.

A standards board would be set up to decide which standards were applicable, and produce or commission specific guidelines where appropriate. How would the delivery of services be improved? A system of clinical and social governance, underpinned by a statutory duty of quality, would ensure health and social care organisations are accountable for continuously improving standards. Clinical and social care governance would rectify poor practice through education, training and research, risk and complaints management, evidence-based practice and continuing professional development. The duty of quality would place a statutory requirement on health and social services boards, health and social services trusts and special agencies, such as the Northern Ireland Blood Transfusion Service, to put and keep in place arrangements to improve and monitor the quality of care they provide to individuals. How would monitoring and regulation be improved? A health services improvement authority would be established to independently monitor social services in a similar way to which Chi assesses standards of healthcare in England and Wales. Chi plans to inspect every NHS trust, health authority through a programme of clinical governance reviews.

Goodbye.'\"</p> <p>The Lib Dems hope to be waving farewell on election night to Mr Raynes, a former Treasury high flyer and policy adviser to William Hague, as they did last May to the old Etonian farmer Tim Palmer.</p> <p>In a byelection prompted by the death in a house fire of the Conservative incumbent Michael Colvin, Romsey pharmacist Mrs Gidley was catapulted to Westminster on an astonishing swing of 12.6%, overturning a Tory majority of over 8,500.</p> <p>The victory, which followed an intensive Lib Dem campaign and a chaotic Tory effort, helped the new Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy repel accusations of failure to make an impact, and caused severe tremors at Conservative central office.</p> <p>At the coming general election, expected on June 7, the Lib Dems are desperate to consolidate an unexpected gain, while the Tories will be in deep trouble if they fail to recover a sprawling shire seat, stretching almost from Andover down to the Southampton fringes, that was previously regarded as natural Conservative heartland.</p> <p>Some Conservatives regard the seat as a touchstone for Mr Hague's leadership - if it falls again the vultures may begin to circle. Labour's Stephen Roberts meanwhile will tacitly encourage supporters to cast tactical Lib Dem votes to keep out a Tory, while aiming not to go as far as his byelection predecessor and lose his deposit.</p> <p>Tory postmortems have, correctly, concluded that the party picked the wrong candidate last time, having controversially rejected a local woman, Liz Perry, whom many feel would have comfortably held the seat. Barbour-clad Mr Palmer, who lived across the border in Dorset, came across badly.</p> <p>But, despite the Tories' insistence that their problems were organisational rather than political, the party's policies - including tough talk on asylum and the usual emphasis on saving the pound - also played badly compared with conventional Lib Dem local fare, focusing on rural post office closures and hospital waiting lists.</p> <p>A rain soaked rally in Romsey's pretty market square last April saw Mr Hague and the shadow chancellor Michael Portillo play to a damp crowd of supporters largely bussed in from other constituencies.</p> <p>Mr Raynes, a key author of the Conservatives' Common Sense Revolution policy document, has common sense enough to stress that regaining the seat will not be easy: \"The electorate has grown up, and no one is prepared to be taken for granted any longer.\"</p> <p>Though the admission sounds astonishing in a constituency in classic Tory territory, the former mandarin is right that many natural Conservatives felt piqued that they had not been wooed but were merely expected to turn out.</p> <p>Significant numbers stayed at home, contributing to the Conservative demise. \"We recognise we could have tried harder when it came to turnout,\" Mr Raynes said. \"There was a certain element of taking people, our own voters, for granted.\"</p> <p>This time, he insisted, \"the whole pace has gone up. Everybody is working\".</p> <p>Mr Raynes, 33, a sharp-brained high flyer with a personable doorstep manner and just a touch of the student politician about his orange jeans and University Challenge haircut, said he was determined to fight a positive campaign on \"issues which matter\" such as tax, bobbies on the beat and Labour's failure to deliver on public services.</p> <p>\"The Liberals will spend their time in Romsey demonising the Tories and demonising me,\" he said. \"I'm going to run a resolutely positive campaign about making lives better for people by doing the things that they value.\"</p> <p>Despite his protestations that his party would run a positive campaign, Mr Raynes was not above saying that Mrs Gidley was \"immensely unpopular with an enormous number of people on both sides\", adding: \"She's not local, she's from Wales.\"</p> <p>The MP was born in Monmouthshire but has lived for years in Romsey, while Mr Raynes, whose selection prompted the resignation of the Tory branch chairman who backed a local candidate, grew up in Surrey before living in London and Paris.</p> <p>Welsh connections or not, Mrs Gidley enters an uphill election battle with the advantage of incumbency. Unlike Ms Robinson, she boasts an approachable manner. Her first year as MP has been spent in earnest Lib Dem backbencher fashion - she has made a solid Commons start while focusing on creating a strong constituency presence, popping up at parish council meetings, schools, hospitals and church services.</p> <p>The Lib Dems will again use the two horse race ploy, urging Labour supporters to vote tactically for Mrs Gidley and dismissing Tory claims that last year's surprise was down to Conservative stay-at-homes.</p> <p>Labour's Mr Roberts, a 40-year-old property businessman and supporter of voting reform, said helpfully: \"Sandra is very popular with Labour voters, which makes my job more difficult.\"</p> <p>For Romsey, as for much of the UK, Labour and the Lib Dems cannot calculate how big a role tactical voting will play in the next election. Both hope that, as the byelection appeared to signal, an anti-Tory vote still exists, with some voters even more prepared to think tactically now they know the strategy can have a real effect.</p> <p>Some Tory votes may also be lost to the anti-EU United Kingdom Independence party, whose candidate Anthony McCabe, will hope to better the surprisingly low 901 votes the party took after an enthusiastic campaign last year.</p> <p>A Tory-supporting antiques dealer a stone's throw from Romsey's ancient abbey, was among those questioning whether the Tories could really win the seat back. The youthful Mr Raynes, he suggested, was again not quite the right candidate for a seat desperate for a mature, genuinely local figure. \"We hear nothing but Sandra Gidley this, Sandra Gidley that - we're sick of it, but at least she's getting about.\"</p> <p>Mrs Gidley, pointing out that her suits are brown unlike Ms Robinson's stern black, travels the constituency wearing a green bracelet - the kind known as Buddha beads - bought for her by her daughter last year and said to represent success. \"I hope it doesn't snap before the election,\" she said. Her link with Westminster may prove stronger than the Conservatives hope.</p>",

In a byelection prompted by the death in a house fire of the Conservative incumbent Michael Colvin, Romsey pharmacist Mrs Gidley was catapulted to Westminster on an astonishing swing of 12.6%, overturning a Tory majority of over 8,500. The victory, which followed an intensive Lib Dem campaign and a chaotic Tory effort, helped the new Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy repel accusations of failure to make an impact, and caused severe tremors at Conservative central office. At the coming general election, expected on June 7, the Lib Dems are desperate to consolidate an unexpected gain, while the Tories will be in deep trouble if they fail to recover a sprawling shire seat, stretching almost from Andover down to the Southampton fringes, that was previously regarded as natural Conservative heartland. Some Conservatives regard the seat as a touchstone for Mr Hague's leadership - if it falls again the vultures may begin to circle. Labour's Stephen Roberts meanwhile will tacitly encourage supporters to cast tactical Lib Dem votes to keep out a Tory, while aiming not to go as far as his byelection predecessor and lose his deposit. Tory postmortems have, correctly, concluded that the party picked the wrong candidate last time, having controversially rejected a local woman, Liz Perry, whom many feel would have comfortably held the seat. Barbour-clad Mr Palmer, who lived across the border in Dorset, came across badly. But, despite the Tories' insistence that their problems were organisational rather than political, the party's policies - including tough talk on asylum and the usual emphasis on saving the pound - also played badly compared with conventional Lib Dem local fare, focusing on rural post office closures and hospital waiting lists. A rain soaked rally in Romsey's pretty market square last April saw Mr Hague and the shadow chancellor Michael Portillo play to a damp crowd of supporters largely bussed in from other constituencies. Mr Raynes, a key author of the Conservatives' Common Sense Revolution policy document, has common sense enough to stress that regaining the seat will not be easy: \"The electorate has grown up, and no one is prepared to be taken for granted any longer.\" Though the admission sounds astonishing in a constituency in classic Tory territory, the former mandarin is right that many natural Conservatives felt piqued that they had not been wooed but were merely expected to turn out. Significant numbers stayed at home, contributing to the Conservative demise. \"We recognise we could have tried harder when it came to turnout,\" Mr Raynes said. \"There was a certain element of taking people, our own voters, for granted.\" This time, he insisted, \"the whole pace has gone up. Everybody is working\". Mr Raynes, 33, a sharp-brained high flyer with a personable doorstep manner and just a touch of the student politician about his orange jeans and University Challenge haircut, said he was determined to fight a positive campaign on \"issues which matter\" such as tax, bobbies on the beat and Labour's failure to deliver on public services. \"The Liberals will spend their time in Romsey demonising the Tories and demonising me,\" he said. \"I'm going to run a resolutely positive campaign about making lives better for people by doing the things that they value.\" Despite his protestations that his party would run a positive campaign, Mr Raynes was not above saying that Mrs Gidley was \"immensely unpopular with an enormous number of people on both sides\", adding: \"She's not local, she's from Wales.\" The MP was born in Monmouthshire but has lived for years in Romsey, while Mr Raynes, whose selection prompted the resignation of the Tory branch chairman who backed a local candidate, grew up in Surrey before living in London and Paris. Welsh connections or not, Mrs Gidley enters an uphill election battle with the advantage of incumbency. Unlike Ms Robinson, she boasts an approachable manner. Her first year as MP has been spent in earnest Lib Dem backbencher fashion - she has made a solid Commons start while focusing on creating a strong constituency presence, popping up at parish council meetings, schools, hospitals and church services. The Lib Dems will again use the two horse race ploy, urging Labour supporters to vote tactically for Mrs Gidley and dismissing Tory claims that last year's surprise was down to Conservative stay-at-homes. Labour's Mr Roberts, a 40-year-old property businessman and supporter of voting reform, said helpfully: \"Sandra is very popular with Labour voters, which makes my job more difficult.\" For Romsey, as for much of the UK, Labour and the Lib Dems cannot calculate how big a role tactical voting will play in the next election. Both hope that, as the byelection appeared to signal, an anti-Tory vote still exists, with some voters even more prepared to think tactically now they know the strategy can have a real effect. Some Tory votes may also be lost to the anti-EU United Kingdom Independence party, whose candidate Anthony McCabe, will hope to better the surprisingly low 901 votes the party took after an enthusiastic campaign last year. A Tory-supporting antiques dealer a stone's throw from Romsey's ancient abbey, was among those questioning whether the Tories could really win the seat back. The youthful Mr Raynes, he suggested, was again not quite the right candidate for a seat desperate for a mature, genuinely local figure. \"We hear nothing but Sandra Gidley this, Sandra Gidley that - we're sick of it, but at least she's getting about.\" Mrs Gidley, pointing out that her suits are brown unlike Ms Robinson's stern black, travels the constituency wearing a green bracelet - the kind known as Buddha beads - bought for her by her daughter last year and said to represent success. \"I hope it doesn't snap before the election,\" she said. Her link with Westminster may prove stronger than the Conservatives hope.",

Research published yesterday, as part of mental health action week, shows that this can happen, even though friendships and social networks are known to be valued and needed by most mental health service users. </p> <p>The research, by the Mental Health Foundation charity, found that four in 10 service users were worried about telling friends about their problems. One in three felt friendships had become strained, or lost, because of their mental distress. </p> <p>On the other side of the coin, one in four people discovered that their friend was having problems only when he or she was admitted to hospital. Most poignantly, one in 20 became aware only when their friend attempted suicide. </p> <p>The research was carried out among 543 people, both service users and their friends. While a small minority of the former - often younger people with serious mental illness - maintain that meaningful social relations matter little, most say that friends can provide crucial emotional and practical support. As one service user told researchers, friends were important just for \"being there when I am lousy company\". </p> <p>About half the service users surveyed said that all or most of their friends did try to understand what was happening and offered help. And where friendships were maintained, the majority of respondents found the quality of the relations enhanced by the experience. </p> <p>However, 34% said they could tell none, or very few, of their friends about their mental distress because they would not understand, or were likely to react negatively. And 39% were worried about doing so. Only 28% said they felt they could tell most of their friends. This was the case even though most said that what they wanted from their friends was just for them to keep in touch and accept them as they were - not necessarily to become carers. </p> <p>Many of those surveyed blamed all this on the continuing stigma attached to mental illness, a view echoed by mental health organisations. But Tom Harrison, a consultant psychiatrist in rehabilitation at South Birmingham mental health trust, who speaks for the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCP) on these issues, cautions against people attributing all friendship losses to stigmatisation. \"I think that people with psychoses in particular, but also some with bi-polar affective disorder and severe depression, go through such traumatic change in their lives that their whole perception of the world is altered,\" he says. \"They can then find it difficult to relate to people who haven't been there. They may lack everyday social skills, and so are likely to lose previous friendships.\" </p> <p>It may be unrealistic to expect \"old\" friendships to survive, Harrison says, and service users may need to develop new friendships with others who have some shared experience. There may be parallels with those who have had the experience as prisoners of war, he suggests. \"Nevertheless, as part of our assertive outreach work, we do try to encourage service users to meet up with old friends, if they agree to this.\" </p> <p>For most people who have mental health problems, old friendships are usually highly valued. The foundation's survey found that the majority of friends provided some form of support - though large numbers reported shock, fright, helplessness or powerlessness. Les Sharpe, who chairs the British Association of Social Workers' mental health special interest group, believes that friends have a significant role to play in care in the community, especially \"in that difficult period, the first three months following hospital discharge, where they can support, informally supervise and rehabilitate service users\". </p> <p>Sharpe acknowledges, however, that friends often face tough emotional challenges and many practical problems. They commonly feel there are few, if any, professionals or others to whom they can turn to get information and advice. One says: \"I would have liked someone to have explained my friend's illness to me, because I was always worried about whether I was doing the right thing. I asked the GP that we both saw and he said that he couldn't discuss it with me. And though he did lend me some books on depressive illnesses, everything was in medical language, so that didn't help. I needed something understandable.\" </p> <p>In effect, she says, she was left to look after her friend's children and provide other support for more than two years, without receiving any advice or being able to contribute in any other way. She is still upset about the \"dismissive\" attitude shown to her when she asked her friend's counsellor what she should do to help. </p> <p>Monica Endersby, from Northampton, had \"a major breakdown\" and was subsequently diagnosed as having a dissociative identity disorder. In effect, she lost all memory of friends and family. \"I would see all these people coming up to me smiling, but I didn't know who they were,\" she says. \"I tried to explain that I'd lost all my memories, but I could see the uncertainty and embarrassment in their faces. My friends said they'd keep in touch, but they didn't - and still don't.\" </p> <p>Consequently, Enderby says she feels embarrassed about her illness, \"though I keep asking myself why, because I didn't hurt anyone; if anything I've been the one who's been hurt\". And she is trenchant about the need to educate the public about mental health. \"One of the biggest problems was that while people often want to help you, they're frightened of doing the wrong thing. I feel it would be helpful if there was some sort of modest guide with some basic dos and don'ts in it, or some other way in which they could get some straightforward advice.\" </p> <p>Larry Culliford, a consultant psychiatrist at South Downs NHS trust, and another of the RCP's experts, recognises the problems faced by friends. \"What happens when people see someone else suffering is that it can resonate fears and confusions within themselves, and lead them into an emotional and intellectual maze,\" he says. \"So if friends want to help, they need to sit back and consider their own initial reactions - particularly in the case of people with problems like a personality disorder - to make sure that they don't get hurt. Then they could approach the various mental health charities and other organisations, to seek advice, and always try to keep in some form of contact with the person - but not too intrusively.\" </p> <p>The Department of Health's national service framework for mental health acknowledges the important role of informal carers and urges health and social care agencies to provide them with more support. But it makes no specific reference to friends. Current discussions about reform of the Mental Health Act include consideration of friends as \"the nearest relative\" - in other words, the main contact person for the service user - so things may be about to change. The foundation's research suggests that change is long overdue. </p> <p>The whole-life approach to mental illness <a href=\"http://www.societytheguardian.com/socialcare/\">www.societytheguardian.com/socialcare/</a></p>",

Les Sharpe, who chairs the British Association of Social Workers' mental health special interest group, believes that friends have a significant role to play in care in the community, especially \"in that difficult period, the first three months following hospital discharge, where they can support, informally supervise and rehabilitate service users\". Sharpe acknowledges, however, that friends often face tough emotional challenges and many practical problems. They commonly feel there are few, if any, professionals or others to whom they can turn to get information and advice. One says: \"I would have liked someone to have explained my friend's illness to me, because I was always worried about whether I was doing the right thing. I asked the GP that we both saw and he said that he couldn't discuss it with me. And though he did lend me some books on depressive illnesses, everything was in medical language, so that didn't help. I needed something understandable.\" In effect, she says, she was left to look after her friend's children and provide other support for more than two years, without receiving any advice or being able to contribute in any other way. She is still upset about the \"dismissive\" attitude shown to her when she asked her friend's counsellor what she should do to help. Monica Endersby, from Northampton, had \"a major breakdown\" and was subsequently diagnosed as having a dissociative identity disorder. In effect, she lost all memory of friends and family. \"I would see all these people coming up to me smiling, but I didn't know who they were,\" she says. \"I tried to explain that I'd lost all my memories, but I could see the uncertainty and embarrassment in their faces. My friends said they'd keep in touch, but they didn't - and still don't.\" Consequently, Enderby says she feels embarrassed about her illness, \"though I keep asking myself why, because I didn't hurt anyone; if anything I've been the one who's been hurt\". And she is trenchant about the need to educate the public about mental health. \"One of the biggest problems was that while people often want to help you, they're frightened of doing the wrong thing. I feel it would be helpful if there was some sort of modest guide with some basic dos and don'ts in it, or some other way in which they could get some straightforward advice.\" Larry Culliford, a consultant psychiatrist at South Downs NHS trust, and another of the RCP's experts, recognises the problems faced by friends. \"What happens when people see someone else suffering is that it can resonate fears and confusions within themselves, and lead them into an emotional and intellectual maze,\" he says. \"So if friends want to help, they need to sit back and consider their own initial reactions - particularly in the case of people with problems like a personality disorder - to make sure that they don't get hurt. Then they could approach the various mental health charities and other organisations, to seek advice, and always try to keep in some form of contact with the person - but not too intrusively.\" The Department of Health's national service framework for mental health acknowledges the important role of informal carers and urges health and social care agencies to provide them with more support. But it makes no specific reference to friends. Current discussions about reform of the Mental Health Act include consideration of friends as \"the nearest relative\" - in other words, the main contact person for the service user - so things may be about to change. The foundation's research suggests that change is long overdue. The whole-life approach to mental illness www.societytheguardian.com/socialcare/",

      "bodyText": "New guidelines for arch-rivals Dyson and Hoover are being drawn up by advertising watchdogs after being forced to referee in an increasingly bitter disputes between rival companies. The Advertising Standards Authority says it is having to deal with more and more industry-to-industry complaints, with manufacturers of vacuum cleaners emerging as some of the worst culprits. It is hoping clearer guidelines about what manufacturers can and can't say will alleviate the problem. Dyson alone has made 12 complaints about campaigns from rival manufacturers including Hoover and Electrolux, while Sebo, Oreck and Miele have also submitted objections. The ASA has to investigate all industry-to-industry complaints it receives and says the process is becoming increasingly time consuming. This week the ASA threw out an objection from Dyson to an advert for a Hoover vacuum cleaner. Dyson said Hoover's claim that the product was the \"most powerful bag-less upright cleaner\" was false. The news will fuel concerns that the ASA, an advertising watchdog set up primarily to address consumer concerns about advertising campaigns, is being hijacked by companies seeking to steal a march on their rivals. Almost 10% of all complaints handled by the ASA are now industry-to-industry. In a recent speech Lord Borrie QC, the chairman of the ASA, called on advertisers to act more responsibly. He said industry-to-industry complaints take up much more than 10% of the ASA's resources because these complaints are the most likely to require outside experts to evaluate evidence.",

'Hello!' has become my catchphrase.\" </p> <p>The phone is, however, an appropriate gimmick for Joly, a man who has earned his fame by, as he puts it, \"being able to bullshit on demand\". The first series of Trigger Happy last year, a candid camera for the MTV generation, was one of Channel 4's biggest hits. Now Joly's creations - the obnoxious mobile man, dogs beating the crap out of each other in the street, the officious park keeper accusing pensioners of playing football - are already threatening to become part of our national consciousness. </p> <p>Trigger Happy TV, Joly is at pains to point out, is hard work to make; it took him and his sidekick, Sam Cadman, a year to shoot each series. \"It looks like it's made by two drunk students in a week. But for the first series we shot two hours of footage for every minute we used. That's more than they did on Apocalypse Now. We got that down to an hour for the second series. But by the end we're emotionally knackered - and we don't make any money because we've used so much pop music on the soundtrack.\" </p> <p>Quite what has motivated Joly to spend two years of his life churning out this stuff isn't immediately clear from his background. He was born in Switzerland, spent his childhood in Lebanon and was educated in Britain and America. He became a runner for MTV before landing an internship as a trainee diplomat (\"It taught me how to lie in a suit\"). After a year in Prague, a coincidental witness to the velvet revolution, he changed tack and became a political producer for ITN, before moving to the Paramount comedy channel to make short Trigger Happy-style fillers between programmes. Channel 4 spotted him and offered him the first series of the show that made his name. </p> <p>Joly has a businesslike - even serious - manner, perhaps a legacy of his \"proper\" jobs. He certainly doesn't have the demeanour of some tiresome office prankster. But does he worry that - aged 33 and married with a daughter - he makes his living this way? Surely at times, for example, when he was sitting in Zermatt prison dressed as a yeti, he must have wondered whether this is a job for a grown man. He shrugs: \"It clearly isn't,\" he admits. \"But unfortunately they don't let children do it. The fact is, it's more enjoyable than any job I've ever done, so in fact it's rather a weird paradox.\" </p> <p>He is reluctant to try to explain the show's appeal: \"Trigger Happy is like Marmite. You either hate it or love it. All we're trying to do is chuck a few surreal moments in to people's lives; to have them going home saying: 'What was all that about?' If people get angry - the way they do with Beadle's shows - we're doing it wrong. The new series is, I think, better than the first. Slightly darker. But people are always coming up with all kinds of theories. Somebody decided that the bits with us fighting in the dog costumes were our take on Pinochet's Chile.\" </p> <p>In fact, Trigger Happy's bizarre attacks on society's conventions are only the latest in the long tradition of the surrealist movement. Its real roots arguably lie in the Dadaists' attempts to bring surrealism to public attention. For his part, Joly acknowledges his debt to the Belgian surrealist Noel Godin, better known as \"l'entarteur\" (\"he who pies\"), and famous for launching custard pies into celebrities' faces (his most famous hit was Bill Gates in 1998). Joly says he sees some truth in Godin's philosophy that a man only reveals his true character when he has a custard pie in his face. And this shows through in Trigger Happy; the pleasure comes as much from watching bystanders reacting to Joly's antics as the stunts themselves. </p> <p>More tellingly - a legacy of his childhood in a French colony - he admits to being a fan of Jacques Tati's amiable buffoon Mr Hulot. And there is more than a hint of Hulot in Joly's bungling spies, forever trying to foist unlikely code words and manilla envelopes on passers-by. That perhaps best explains why Trigger Happy's whimsy is so appealing: it exists in its own childish world where violence is always cartoonish; leavened with enough surrealism to negate any sense of threat. </p> <p>Some have suggested that practical jokers must have a misanthropic streak. It doesn't show with Joly, although he certainly has an anarchic bent and even a rather caustic streak. He is constantly tossing off remarks which could be hurtful if not tempered with a disarming quick-wittedness. He also admits to lying in interviews. \"They're so boring. People keep asking the same questions: what's your mobile phone ring tone? How long do you think Trigger Happy will last? I've told people I've worked as a tour guide on a river bus and that I was a junior gardener at Kew. Somebody once said to me: I see from the internet that your daughter's called Missy Missy Jamon Jamon. I thought, didn't you realise that might have been a joke?\" </p> <p>But he says that his view of human nature - especially that of the British - has altered in the light of shooting the show. \"What's weird about British people is that they don't react. In New York and Belgium people would just say, 'Go away. You're annoying me.' But here people just do what they're told. I think it shows that we don't live in a cynical and hard-bitten country.\" </p> <p>He's also refreshingly down-to-earth about his \"c-list\" celebrity status (\"c-plus on a good day\"): \"It's partly because all this happened to me when I was 31 - if this had happened when I was 23 I'd be a nightmare. I'd be snorting cocaine off dwarves' heads. In a sense my status is quite uncomfortable. I've turned myself into a kind of leper. If go into a shop, everybody dives down thinking I'm going to pull out a phone. Even if I go to the gym, everybody thinks I've got a camera in the showers. People assume I'm pulling pranks 24 hours a day and that I'm really wacky. I'm so far from wacky. \" </p> <p>He says, that - apart from any one-off specials - this second series is the last. He'd rather end it before people tire of it. He's currently preparing a series of pilots for Channel 4, including a subversive fly-on-the-wall documentary, using all the invites to things like the openings of provincial nightclubs he gets sent. A kind of real-life Alan Partridge, he says. </p> <p>At the end of the interview, I can't resist asking for a go on the mobile phone. He grabs a camera and takes a picture. \"I'll send it to you,\" he says, as he escorts me to the lifts. But he can't resist a Trigger Happyesque parting shot as he walks away: \"If you stitch me up, I'll draw a moustache on it first.\" </p> <p>\u0095 The new series of Trigger Happy begins this Friday, 9.30pm, Channel 4.</p>",

      "bodyText": "As Britain braces itself for another round of fuel price increases, campaigners today warned the chancellor, Gordon Brown, that allowing pump prices to rise would be \"political suicide\" in the run up to the general election. The major companies and supermarkets were remaining tight-lipped today about their plans after oil giant Shell put up the price of petrol by a penny a litre. Garry Russell, of the Dump the Pump campaign, described the situation as \"horrendous\". He said: \"This is going to bring the whole issue to the forefront again and it is going to highlight just how fragile things are. \"Obviously the government are going to use this and say it is the oil companies. But the level of taxation that is piled on top is a major issue. The government is making huge revenues and they are unlikely to do anything about it.\" Brynle Williams, the fuel duty campaigner and north Wales farmer, said: \"If Gordon Brown allows prices to go up it will be political suicide. Fuel is going to be very high on the agenda during the general election. \"I won't be leading the next fuel protest - the general public themselves will be,\" he added. In announcing its price rise, Shell blamed the jump in the cost of crude oil for the increase which is being introduced in 800 of its 1,100 UK forecourts to bring them in line with the remaining 300 which saw a similar rise last week. The move comes as the Petrol Retailers' Association warned that prices could rise by up to two pence a litre in the next few days. Jonathan Akerman, a spokesman for the PRA, said: \"What we are likely to see is a price rise of between one and two pence over the next three days, but before the general election it is unlikely that there will be further substantial price rises. \"Even if there are further rises, they will be small - of one or two pence again.\" The Shell price rise has come after speculation that Monday's explosion at the Conoco plant near Immingham, north Lincolnshire, could add to the upwards pressure on petrol prices in the UK over the next month. Gordon Brown, the chancellor, announced a cut in the price of ultra low sulphur petrol (ULSP) of 2p a litre in the Budget last month. With ULSP not yet available nationwide, the 2p cut was extended to unleaded petrol until June 14. Ultra low sulphur diesel was to come down by 3p a litre, it was announced. John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB union said: \"The time has come for ministers to call the bluff of the oil barons. If the huge price increases that have been reported do materialise, they should immediately seize profits by slapping a windfall tax on the oil companies. The fuel guzzlers' greed has gone far enough.\" The RAC foundation called on the chancellor to stabilise UK fuel prices by introducing a sliding scale of fuel duty which would fluctuate according to world prices.

But this official caution has failed to contain an explosion of joy in a nation that has had little to celebrate during more than a decade of economic stagnation and political drift. Regular programmes have been interrupted for special pregnancy bulletins, newspapers have printed special editions and everyone from the man and woman in the street to retired imperial retainers and the princess' old school teachers has been interviewed for comment. Despite the pleas for quiet and respect, more than 100 journalists have staked out the home of Masako's parents, while television stations have broadcast images of a six to seven-week embryo.</p> <p>That this is still considered relatively low-key coverage underlines just how much is riding on the production of an heir to the Chrysanthemum throne by the 37-year-old Masako and her 41-year-old husband, crown prince Naruhito. Japan's imperial family boasts the world's oldest unbroken royal line. According to the government, the current emperor, Akihito, is the 125th holder of a throne that stretches back to the Emperor Jimmu in 550BC. Ancient myths, which were taught as fact until just 50 years ago, trace his lineage to the sun goddess Amaterasu in the dawn of creation.</p> <p>And, divine or not, this line is in danger of dying out. Under modern Japanese law, only a man can inherit the throne, but no boys have been born into the family since the birth of Naruhito's brother in 1965. This succession crisis has cast a darkening shadow over the lives of Naruhito and Masako since their marriage in 1993.</p> <p>A popular match, it was initially hoped that Masako would not only produce an heir, but, like Diana, the late princess of Wales, help to modernise an institution that was seen as out of touch and out of date. The multilingual Oxford and Harvard-educated former diplomat was seen as an independent and internationally minded career woman who could complement the traditional role of her husband, who spent his time at Oxford studying 18th-century commodity transport on the Thames. Initially, the subject of babies was fended off with jokes. \"I know the crown prince likes classical music,\" said Masako at a press conference to announce their engagement, \"but I hope he won't expect me to produce an orchestra.\"</p> <p>By stealing the limelight from her partner, however - an unforgivable act according to the male-orientated Confucian traditions of the imperial family - this witticism reportedly earned the princess-to-be a rebuke from palace retainers. After that, Masako deferred to her husband, almost never appeared in public alone, dressed more soberly and always walked demurely three steps behind him.</p> <p>The couple's humorous rebuttals about children also became more strained. \"The stork may be scared off by all the attention,\" Naruhito told reporters after the pressures of a childless first year of marriage began to tell.</p> <p>Strict control of court reporting by the imperial household agency meant that questions on this touchy subject have almost never been voiced by the mainstream media since. It is clearly a matter of national pride. Earlier this year, the Japanese ambassador to Germany complained when the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper published a picture of Naruhito with the caption \"dead trousers\" to suggest he was impotent.</p> <p>But that has not stopped speculation by gossip magazines, which have splashed erroneous royal pregnancy headlines every time Masako has missed an appointment, put on a little weight or switched to flat-soled shoes.</p> <p>There was no mistake, however, about a scoop by the Asahi newspaper in November 1999, which broke the news that Masako was expecting, just four weeks into the pregnancy. This led to a month-long media scrummage, the low point of which saw television crews in helicopters buzzing over a car carrying Masako to the gynaecologist. Her miscarriage a month later was partly blamed on the frenzy.</p> <p>Similar fears have been expressed this time. \"This is happy news,\" said the prime minister. Yoshiro Mori. \"But I hope everyone will observe it quietly.\" Masako's father, Hisashi Owada, was equally cautious. \"I am pleased, but also very worried,\" he said.</p> <p>The Japanese media has acknowledged it was at fault before, but it remains to be seen how restrained it can be, given the immense public interest in the pregnancy.</p> <p>\"We take the criticism. However, we must say the coverage showed how strongly Japanese people wished for a baby,\" the conservative Sankei newspaper said in an editorial. \"The birth of their baby will lighten up people's hearts amid depressing news ranging from economic recession to political uncertainty.\"</p> <p>Expectations already appear to be outstripping reality. Although it is too early to be sure the pregnancy will go to term, speculation has already begun about whether the baby will be a boy or a girl, and the impact it will have on the economy and Japan's low birthrate.</p> <p>The former question is of particular interest to feminists, who want to see a change in Japan's laws of succession to allow a woman to inherit the throne. There have been several precedents. Before the current rules were introduced in the last century, Japan had been ruled by 10 empresses, the last being Go-Sakuramachi, who abdicated in 1771. Last April, the imperial household agency considered the possibility of reverting to such a system in a study paper that assessed the options if no boys are born in future.</p> <p>Of more immediate concern to the politicians and businessmen is the effect that an imperial baby might have on the birthrate.

I met an eyewitness, Ismail ali Mohammed, who told me that he was driving his truck delivering sugar cane vegetation when the earthquake struck.

      "bodyText": "Voters in Mississippi seem likely to have kept the \"southern cross\" battle emblem of the Confederacy flying on their state flag despite a drive by local businesses and black groups to replace it with a less divisive symbol. The turnout in a referendum yesterday was reported to be heavy as up to 2m voters decided whether to remain the only one of the 50 US states to give a prominent place to the civil war \"rebel\" flag or follow other southern states in consigning the emblem to history. \"It's really heavy here this morning,\" said Barbara Dunn an election official in Hinds county, north of the state capital, Jackson. \"Some of my people tell me they've had to wait in line, and one person said that when he left his precinct a little after 7am there were a hundred people lined up to vote.\" Supporters of a new state flag want the southern cross, which has occupied the top lefthand quarter of the flag since 1894, replaced by a circular design of 20 stars, marking Mississippi's position as the 20th state to join the union in 1817. The governor, Ronnie Musgrove, voted for the new flag in Jackson. The referendum was \"an opportunity to remove any obstacle that would stand in the way of bringing good jobs to our state\", he told reporters. But opinion polls suggested that a clear majority of voters wanted to keep the old flag. An Associated Press poll at the beginning of April showed three-to-one support for the present design. White voters, who make up two-thirds of the state's population, were opposed to change by four to one, the poll found. Black voters favoured change by more than two to one, but a significant minority supported the old emblem. The campaign was marked by an unusual alliance in favour of the new flag between mainly white business leaders and local and national black groups. Local black churches made a major last-minute effort in the final week to overcome voter apathy. Black civil rights groups such as the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People ran dozens of adverts on local black radio stations in the final days of the campaign. But the biggest pressure for change came from business interests anxious to send a signal around the US and beyond that their state is ready and willing to enter the global economy. They invested more than $750,000 (\u00a3520,000) in the campaign for the new flag, outspending the defenders of the old flag by more than five to one. Groups such as the Mississippi Economic Council - the local equivalent of a chamber of commerce - led the campaign for the new flag, along with bankers and property development interests. The former president of the Netscape internet browser corporation, Jim Barksdale, a native of Mississippi, played a prominent role financing the change campaign. Advocates of change say that the southern cross is a symbol of racism and segregation and a standing insult to black Americans in Mississippi and beyond. But supporters say the old flag is a statement of \"southern heritage\" and ancestral pride which should remain in place. In the past year state legislatures in Georgia and South Carolina have taken action to reduce the profile of the southern cross Confederate emblem on state flags and buildings. The Mississippi legislature decided against taking a similar decision itself, preferring to leave the issue to the voters.",

      "bodyText": "Our Lady of Victory near Stroud, Gloucestershire, is one institution where errant Roman Catholic priests have long been sent for rehabilitation. Built on a terrace in a picturesque valley with lawns sloping down to woods, it has the appearance more of a Cotswold manor house than a clinic. But in the lecture hall and consulting rooms, alcoholic, gay and paedophile clergymen are offered counselling and support. These are problems acknowledged quietly by some Catholic priests to be exacerbated by the solitary, often lonely, and celibate life of the priesthood. Celibacy is a discipline imposed by the church, rather than by a theological imperative, and therefore one that might one day be changed, if the shortage of priests becomes sufficiently pressing. In Britain the church accepted more than 100 married Anglican priests for ordination some years ago when they fell out with the Church of England over its decision to ordain women. Of more concern to some in the Catholic church is the fear that increasing numbers of priests are gay. A book by an American theologian last year estimated that as many as 50% of young US ordinands were homosexual. Being gay is still viewed as a scandal and a sin and hence a suitable reason for treatment and rehabilitation at centres such as Stroud. But when it comes to child abuse, the church has for many years been in denial - that the problem exists and is intractable in sufferers, and that it is something that requires firm action. This has inhibited the church from tackling it, rather than just reacting to individual cases and occasionally buying off complainants. Even though it has had guidelines in place since 1994, some clergy have been slow to acknowledge or accept them. In a deeply hierarchical church, there is a limit to what outside agencies can do. When Archbishop John Ward of Cardiff was found last year to have ignored the guidelines - and even a warning from a fellow bishop - in ordaining a priest subsequently convicted of child abuse, there was nothing the church could do to censure him, other than calling him in for a carpeting by the papal nuncio in London. The recommendations of the Nolan review will at least focus the hierarchy's attention on the principle that the needs of children are paramount, rather than protecting the good name of the church. But there are still unanswered questions about how priests can be disciplined - or protected from bogus allegations. The clinic, often referred to as Stroud, is run by an American order, the Servants of the Paraclete, established in New Mexico in the 1940s. The order opened Our Lady of Victory, its only British centre, in the 1960s. The clinic offers \"therapy in a spiritual context\". It is believed that up to 30 residents stay there, usually for a year to 18 months. They tend to be referred by their bishops or other senior clergy. Michael Hill, the priest jailed for five years in 1997 for indecent assaults on children, was once there but left after three months. He was appointed chaplain at Gatwick in the 1980s by Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, now Archbishop of Westminster but then bishop of Arundel and Brighton, despite complaints that he had been a risk to children. The centre has attracted criticism. An assistant priest who spent a week there after it was discovered that he was a practising homosexual compared it to \"purgatory\" complaining of the \"gross invasion of privacy, the lack of freedom of movement and the oppressive, claustrophobic atmosphere\". It hit the headlines in 1993 when Father Sean Seddon, 38, was sent there after a six-year affair with a teacher. On learning his lover had lost their baby, he threw himself under a train. Institutions such as Our Lady of Victory are apparently becoming less popular. The tendency is for priests to be treated in secular organisations. Yesterday nobody at the centre was available for comment. Sex attacks Between 1995 and 1999, 21 Catholic priests were convicted of sexual offences against children. Reported sex cases include: \u0095 1996: Durham priest Adrian McLeish jailed for six years after admitting 12 charges of child abuse \u0095 1997: Michael Hill, a former Gatwick chaplain, jailed for five years for indecent assault and gross indecency over a 19-year period \u0095 1998: Eric Taylor jailed for seven years for abusing boys in his care at the Father Hudson Society's home in Warwickshire, between 1957 and 1965 \u0095 1998: John Lloyd , press officer to the Archbishop of Cardiff, jailed for eight years for indecent assaults against children \u0095 2000: Joe Jordan , a Cardiff priest, jailed for eight years for sexually abusing boys \u0095 2000: Investigation at a leading Catholic school, the London Oratory .

Ninety-six of the 113 people who died in the crash were Germans going to New York to join a Caribbean cruise when the jet crashed shortly after take-off from Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris. The German newspaper Die Welt yesterday reported that the airline had given the families until the end of this week to accept or reject an offer of DM300m, roughly equivalent to \u00a31m for each victim. Such a figure - more than double previous estimates - would make it the biggest compensation payment ever made in Germany.

Almost everyone involved in the project was also involved in the Millennium Dome's central attraction, a lowest-common-denominator crowd-pleaser. With its death-defying bungee jumps, it owed more to Don't Try This at Home than to theatre. </p> <p>The Dome Show may have been pap, but that is not to say that those involved don't have talent. If the Dome has any lasting legacy, it is the 80 or so young performers who were trained to perform in it. Storm includes 20 of them as performers and artistic directors. They hope to silence those critics of the Dome training project who argued that once the attraction closed most of the young performers would find themselves in the dole queue. </p> <p>As Paul Cockle, former production manager of the Dome Show and now the producer for Storm, says: \"There has been a lot of paranoia in the circus industry. A lot of people have been saying that there are already too many performers and we must stop training. But I think that if there isn't the work to go round, we simply have to create it.\" </p> <p>Getting this show together hasn't been easy. Cockle and his team, which includes Pierrot Bidon, who has worked with Archaos, and rock concert designer Mark Fisher, originally had plans for a big stadium show. Cockle would have liked to open at Wembley Arena, or better still the Albert Hall, where Cirque de Soleil performed for a number of years. </p> <p>Cockle seems much enamoured of this bland Canadian company, which has created a brand and turned over millions. But to stage a show in the Albert Hall Cockle reckoned he would need \u00a31.5m. Perhaps unsurprisingly, no independent producer could be convinced to give that kind of money to a company with no track record. Instead, Storm is being mounted on a budget of around \u00a3100,000, the bulk of which comes from an investment grant from the National Endowment Fund for Science, Technology and the Arts. </p> <p>This small budget may prove to be the show's salvation. Everyone involved with the mounting of the Dome Show signed a confidentiality agreement that prevents them from disclosing how much it cost, but at a conference last year one member of the team let slip that you could have bought \"15 villas in Notting Hill\" for the same money. If that is correct, the Dome Show probably cost far more than The Lion King, which, at \u00a310m, is the most expensive stage musical ever mounted. </p> <p>Without piles of money, the Generating Company will be forced to come up with artistic solutions rather than rely on spectacle. The suggestion is that the largely aerial-based piece will have all the skill of some of the big international circuses, but also intimacy and a sense of character. Former actor Sean Kempton, a Generating Company performer and artistic director, says that the company approaches the trapeze in the way an actor approaches a piece of text. \"Just as an actor you try to find the relationship between your character and the script, here we try to find the same relationship between the character and the equipment. With the Dome Show we did spectacle for a year; now we want to connect with an audience. Storm has always been more of a theatrical proposition than a circus proposition. We are trying to get away from the idea of the circus act.\" </p> <p>If this proves to be the case, Storm could be a breakthrough for British circus, which, with rare exceptions, is still struggling to throw off its sawdust image and embrace character, narrative and metaphor. But the real difficulty facing the Generating Company is that the great circus-based companies, such as Circus Oz and De La Guarda, were involved in theatre before they turned to the circus. Each grew organically, developing their identity and dynamic over a period of years. Unlike them, the Generating Company will have just one chance to prove itself. Unless Storm succeeds at the box office the company simply won't be able to do another show. The economics of British circus allow for no safety nets. </p> <p>\u0095 Storm is at the Combustion Chamber at the Circus Space, London N1 (020-7316 4740), until May 12, then tours to Manchester, Glasgow, Newcastle, Henley and York.</p>",

These will be rebranded as Holiday Inns - one of the group's two global brands, alongside Inter-Continental. </p> <p>Meanwhile, a \u00a32bn battle for control of Compass' Le Meridien hotels looks set to reach a climax by the end of the month. </p> <p>These are just the latest in a bewildering series of takeovers that have transformed the landscape of the hospitality industry. Mark Abramson, leisure analyst at Bear Stearns, says: \"Everyone's been looking for dance partners. The pressure's been on to find opportunities.\" </p> <p>The land-grab began in earnest in early 1998 when Bass bought Inter-Continental Hotels for \u00a31.78bn from Japan's Saison Group. That deal was said to have been clinched by a private meeting between Bass boss Sir Ian Prosser and Emperor Akihito - one of Saison's more prestigious shareholders. </p> <p>Tom Oliver, chief executive of Bass Hotels and Resorts, says: \"Brands are everything - as travel becomes increasingly trans-border, hotels which aren't carrying international brands simply don't deliver the same rate of revenue per room.\" </p> <p>Bass was unwittingly pushed into hotels by trade secretary Margaret Beckett, who thwarted the group's ambitions to be come a global brewer by blocking its purchase of Carlsberg-Tetley. Fellow brewer Whitbread realised that it, too, could not go much further in beer, and began building its Travel Inn chain and its British franchise for Marriott Hotels, snapping up Swallow Hotels for \u00a3578m in November 1999. </p> <p>Leisure group Ladbroke joined the rush, switching its focus from gambling to hotels. It bought the 54-strong Stakis chain for \u00a31.1bn in 1999 to add to its 169 Hilton hotels. To reflect its new focus, Ladbroke changed its name to Hilton Group - which did not impress residents of the Warwickshire village of Ladbroke, where the company began. One said: \"I think it's a shame. I'm not against change but if it's been a good name for a long time, why change it?\" </p> <p><strong> Hived off hospitality</strong></p> <p> Then last year Granada, which had wrested control of Forte Hotels in a bitter 1995 takeover battle, decided to concentrate on media. It hived off its hospitality interests to Compass, which immediately put the Posthouse, Heritage and Le Meridien chains up for sale. </p> <p>Of these three, the only one still to go is Le Meridien, which is being stalked by Marriott International and Nomura, with French chain Accor and Starwood of the US as dark horses. </p> <p>All these deals have been motivated by a recognition that the market is changing. In the US, 75% of hotels have a well-known brand, compared with just 25% in Europe. Lesley Ashplant, a hotels expert at PricewaterhouseCoopers, says: \"Europe is the single largest tourist destination in the world. It has 6m hotel rooms under fragmented ownership. There are clear opportunities in scale, in taking advantage of branding and advanced technology.\" </p> <p>Size is becoming important as expectations rise - international business travellers want internet connections, widescreen televisions and push-button blinds in every room, all of which requires investment. They want faxes delivered to their rooms at all hours of the night and the ability to order foie gras at four o'clock in the morning - which means employing more staff than most independent operators can afford. </p> <p>Hi-tech reservations systems are also emerging as a crucial factor. In an industry where 75% of costs are staff wages, any savings elsewhere are precious. Mr Oliver says: \"It doesn't necessarily loom as a big operating expense but when you look at the overall profit and loss account, it's one of those elements which can vary.\" </p> <p>Stockbroker Bear Stearns points out that hotels have only a small window of opportunity to increase their margins. Between a third and half of hotels' revenue comes from food and drink, but these only contribute 20% to 30% of profit.

The main thrust, therefore, for most operators, is on improving occupancy. Loyalty card schemes are becoming increasingly elaborate. They can record guests' preferences for well-cooked steak, ground-floor rooms or feather-free pillows.

      "trailText": "<p>Neil Finn tells  <strong>Adam Sweeting</strong> why he'd rather share a stage with his fans.</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It's probably the shape of things to come. Singer-songwriter Neil Finn is live online from his recording studio in New Zealand, strumming through a few songs from his new solo album, One Nil, and answering questions in between. The computer image sometimes lapses into jerky freeze-frame or locks up altogether, but it's a glimpse of the way the internet is turning 1960s-style visions of a \"global village\" into reality. Or virtual reality, at least. </p> <p>\"I'm just starting to explore the possibilities of the net,\" Finn explains a couple of days later, on the plain old telephone. \"Being on the other side of the planet, I'm dead keen on anything I can do to bridge the gap. It saves me having to get on a plane every time I want to do something.\" </p> <p>Eager fans also had the chance to catch Finn's live webcast from the St James's Theatre, Auckland on April 6, part of a five-night residency starring Finn alongside a temporary all-star line-up featuring the likes of Radiohead's Ed O'Brien and Phil Selway, Johnny Marr, Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder, and Lisa Germano. \"It started as a whimsical notion, then became a determined effort to become a band in a really short space of time, do five shows and break up,\" Finn explains. \"In a way, it's the ideal trajectory for a band.\" </p> <p>The project was evidence of Finn's new-found determination to embrace the full meaning of working as a solo artist, away from the comforting environment of a band. After 20-odd years with Split Enz and then Crowded House, Finn thinks he's seen enough of group dynamics for one lifetime. At 42, he has discovered the joys of taking risks. It's slightly startling behaviour from an old-fashioned musician who tips his hat to vintage singer-songwriters such as Neil Young, Cat Stevens and David Bowie. </p> <p>\"I had a couple of sleepless nights before Johnny Marr and the Radiohead guys turned up, thinking, 'Oh my God! It looks good on paper but this might not work,' \" Finn says. \"But I wanted to be able to play differently every time. I'm looking for uncertainty because I like that feeling of teetering on the edge. I think people play at their best when there's an element of struggle.\" </p> <p>Finn offered a glimpse of his new recklessness at his show at London's Palace theatre in February, when he invited strangers onstage to play songs from his back catalogue. Ironically, they sounded rather better rehearsed than Wendy and Lisa, who collaborated on Finn's new album, and played with him in London. \"Everybody who came onstage was as comfortable as I was,\" he says. \"I think a couple of them may do those songs with a tribute band. There was a father and son who were really into it, and they knew the songs better than I did.\" </p> <p>The potential for disaster in this policy is obvious, but Finn thinks he knows his audience well enough to take the chance. \"With Crowded House, sometimes we'd open it up to the floor and some dickhead would come up and start posturing. But I think I've got better at picking people who are going to make something of it. Also, I've discovered through the internet and from emails that come in that they're mostly a pretty evolved bunch of fans now.

      "bodyText": "It's probably the shape of things to come. Singer-songwriter Neil Finn is live online from his recording studio in New Zealand, strumming through a few songs from his new solo album, One Nil, and answering questions in between. The computer image sometimes lapses into jerky freeze-frame or locks up altogether, but it's a glimpse of the way the internet is turning 1960s-style visions of a \"global village\" into reality. Or virtual reality, at least. \"I'm just starting to explore the possibilities of the net,\" Finn explains a couple of days later, on the plain old telephone. \"Being on the other side of the planet, I'm dead keen on anything I can do to bridge the gap. It saves me having to get on a plane every time I want to do something.\" Eager fans also had the chance to catch Finn's live webcast from the St James's Theatre, Auckland on April 6, part of a five-night residency starring Finn alongside a temporary all-star line-up featuring the likes of Radiohead's Ed O'Brien and Phil Selway, Johnny Marr, Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder, and Lisa Germano. \"It started as a whimsical notion, then became a determined effort to become a band in a really short space of time, do five shows and break up,\" Finn explains. \"In a way, it's the ideal trajectory for a band.\" The project was evidence of Finn's new-found determination to embrace the full meaning of working as a solo artist, away from the comforting environment of a band. After 20-odd years with Split Enz and then Crowded House, Finn thinks he's seen enough of group dynamics for one lifetime. At 42, he has discovered the joys of taking risks. It's slightly startling behaviour from an old-fashioned musician who tips his hat to vintage singer-songwriters such as Neil Young, Cat Stevens and David Bowie. \"I had a couple of sleepless nights before Johnny Marr and the Radiohead guys turned up, thinking, 'Oh my God! It looks good on paper but this might not work,' \" Finn says. \"But I wanted to be able to play differently every time. I'm looking for uncertainty because I like that feeling of teetering on the edge. I think people play at their best when there's an element of struggle.\" Finn offered a glimpse of his new recklessness at his show at London's Palace theatre in February, when he invited strangers onstage to play songs from his back catalogue. Ironically, they sounded rather better rehearsed than Wendy and Lisa, who collaborated on Finn's new album, and played with him in London. \"Everybody who came onstage was as comfortable as I was,\" he says. \"I think a couple of them may do those songs with a tribute band. There was a father and son who were really into it, and they knew the songs better than I did.\" The potential for disaster in this policy is obvious, but Finn thinks he knows his audience well enough to take the chance. \"With Crowded House, sometimes we'd open it up to the floor and some dickhead would come up and start posturing. But I think I've got better at picking people who are going to make something of it. Also, I've discovered through the internet and from emails that come in that they're mostly a pretty evolved bunch of fans now. There's the odd strange one, but mostly they're just into the music.\" The connection with Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman, best known for their work with Prince in the 1980s, was another chance encounter that happened to produce a worthwhile result. While he was working on One Nil in Los Angeles, Finn was introduced to them by his co-producer Tchad Blake. \"Then two weeks later I was at Tchad's house and Wendy was there, and we decided to have a play.

      "body": "<p>We expect debut plays to be angry, like Look Back in Anger or Blasted. Sometimes they're eye-openingly autobiographical: think of Ayub Khan-Din's East is East. Such are the trusted formulae for writers seeking exposure. But one memorable 1990s debut went against the grain. In a decade characterised by onstage buggery and baby-munching, Knives in Hens - first seen in 1995 at Edinburgh's Traverse, then at London's Bush Theatre - was an elliptical, sensual affair, describing how an unfulfilled young woman in a Scottish rural community takes control of her life after a local miller teaches her the words needed to understand it. It heightened the incongruity that the writer was a man, David Harrower, from Glasgow, a city not noted for its rustic airs. </p> <p>\"I don't know where it came from,\" says Harrower. But he knows why he didn't write about his own life. \"I feel quite keenly that I don't have much to draw on. My background is lower-middle class and with no passion about it. That can mean thrashing around for things to write about.\" Before Knives in Hens, he had been trying to write about land ownership in Scotland. \"It was my angry play, but it had taken two years to write and it's exhausting to maintain anger for that long.\" His breakthrough came when he nixed the rage and concentrated on the characters, asking himself, \"How would they respond to each other, and to the land?\" </p> <p>The play's worldwide success - \"There's a production in Colombia,\" smirks its writer - confirmed in Harrower a conviction that it's what the characters, not the writer, want to say that matters. The theory was developed in 1998's Kill the Old, Torture Their Young at the Traverse. Harrower's third major play, Presence, opens at the Royal Court tomorrow, three years after it was commissioned. If the contrast to his prolific countryman David Greig seems pronounced, 34-year-old Harrower would ask that his several adaptations, which include Six Characters in Search of an Author at the Young Vic in February, and Woyzeck at Edinburgh's Lyceum next month, be taken into consideration. </p> <p>It's an oeuvre that has led this paper's theatre critic, Michael Billington, to describe Harrower as \"not a man who raises his voice\". The writer would until recently have agreed. \"I don't have the desire to shock, I'm not a shocking person,\" he says, then corrects himself: \"Well, I am in my own private life, but I'm not going to foist that on other people.\" He prefers his plays to be \"quite mysterious. I like scuzzing things up. I like to drop the audience in it so they don't know where they are. I don't like playwrights who flag you in, like at an airport.\" David Mamet, he says, has compared good drama to snatches of conversation overheard in a restaurant. </p> <p>Knives in Hens began abruptly with a disarming denial, directed from wife to husband: \"I'm not a field.\" \"I could feel people wondering what was going on,\" Harrower recalls. \"But then the world enveloped them.\" </p> <p>It sounds like a rock-solid writerly philosophy, but it stands on shaky foundations. \"You've caught me at a difficult stage right now,\" says Harrower. He has a strong dislike for didacticism - \"theatre is the only artform that tells people they have to come, otherwise they'd be missing some kind of document of our times\" - and argues that the films of the Coen brothers are \"just as important as cultural documents\" as those of Ken Loach or Jimmy McGovern. </p> <p>But, provoked by his need to write for London (because Scotland has too few venues to support him) and by the nature of his relationship with the Royal Court (he can't think of another Scot who writes for it) Harrower is thinking of raising his own voice a decibel or two. \"My work has not, so far, been capital P political, but now I'm thinking about going that way.\" A move to angry playwriting? \"Not angry. Disgruntled. Pissed off, maybe.\" </p> <p>\"Why is it,\" asks Harrower, expanding on his disaffection, \"that if an Irish writer writes something, it transcends the culture it's written in, but if a Scottish or Highland writer writes the same, it wouldn't get anywhere near London? It's maybe Cromwellian guilt: we're going to listen to these people rather than slaughter them.\" </p> <p>He is canny enough to lay equal blame at the Scots' own door. \"Is there that desire in Scotland for our drama to go out there into the world? There isn't an immediate sense here of people wanting to express themselves through drama.\" He contrasts the dearth of plays from the margins of Scotland with the situation in Ireland: Martin McDonagh's hit Leenane trilogy first cropped up in Galway. \"Where is the writing from Ayrshire? Where's the writing from Dornoch? From the scuzzy places up north, where there's fuck all to do, but where there's an individual voice.\" </p> <p>Harrower's is the impatience of a trailblazer: Scotland has a venerable tradition of company-based theatre, but not of playwriting. \"There's an excitement about that,\" says his friend and colleague David Greig. But Harrower suggests there are responsibilities, too. \"I'm the only Scot at the Royal Court and my play has nothing to do with Scotland. I have to ask myself why that is; why, as a Scottish writer, I've chosen to write about four guys from Liverpool going to Germany.\" </p> <p>He feels sharply his failure (so far) to address Scottish society at a time of profound change. \"I've got to go back\" - he lives in Glasgow - \"and think about how I can respond to the culture and the place that I live in. I'm getting tired of telling well-crafted stories that take me so long to put together. It's time that I started getting my hands dirty.\" </p> <p>Presence, he says, is his most well-crafted story yet - but to write it he has steeped his hands in some pretty murky waters. Although it came about because he \"wanted to write about the dynamics of a band\", the play now deals with a rather more provocative subject: the link between The Beatles (who are never explicitly named) and Nazism. \"It is documented,\" he says, \"that they got up in front of a German audience and did Nazi salutes, shouted 'you Nazi bastards' and 'Sieg Heil' and walked around in jackboots, just to get a rise out of the audience.\" Harrower identifies this incident as the turning point in the band's career, the moment at which \"they found a new engagement with the audience. They thought, 'We don't give a fuck, we're not just standing here as a backing band.' I've got a sense,\" he adds with a twinkle, \"that it might have been John Lennon who started it\" - although he's bracing himself for \"McCartney in jackboots shock!\" headlines. </p> <p>In Presence, the incident sparks off a meditation on \"how much Britain taught its own young about the war\". The play - which stars The Royle Family's Ralf Little - contrasts the group's awareness of Germany's crimes with their ignorance of Britain's, which included firebombing Hamburg. Harrower also pitches their crowd-baiting against the backdrop of a country in which, two decades previously, young people who formed pop groups (or swing groups, in those days) were sent to concentration camps and even sterilised. \"And there the Beatles were,\" reflects Harrower, \"on top of the world, thinking no one had ever before been young like they were young.\" </p> <p>If demonising St Macca (\"He doesn't come out of the play very well,\" says Harrower) is almost as inflammatory these days as goose-stepping before a German pop crowd in 1960, we can rest assured that in Harrower's hands it will not be an aggressive experience. \"I think about my sister when I write.\" he says. \"She never comes to the theatre, she's got a job and a kid. I ask myself, what might she come and see with her friends?\" His plays may be as wry and inquisitive as the writer himself, but Harrower remains keenly aware that \"people don't want to be shouted at or told what to think. People want to be entertained.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Presence is at the Royal Court, London SW1 (020-7565 5000), from tomorrow until May 12.</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Catwalk models may be getting younger, pop singers may be pre-pubescent and the images of movie stars may be getting more perfectly airbrushed but, in the world of modern dance, wrinkles seem to be the coming thing. </p> <p>There have always been starry individuals who have extended their performing lives way beyond pensionable age. Martha Graham ran the gauntlet of arthritis and alcohol to prolong her dance career until she was 74; at 82, Merce Cunningham has only recently given up being the elderly Puck-turned-Prospero of his own dance creations; and the Japanese star of butoh, Kazuo Ohno, continues to perform at 94. What's special about the present trend is that it involves ordinary dancers, rather than box-office names. </p> <p>A surprising number of recent productions in Britain suggest that choreographers are finding themselves less entranced by the perfect limbs of 20-year-olds than by the dramatic and physical possibilities of bodies that have been lived in. The French choreographer Ea Sola, for instance, made an eloquent case for age when she featured a chorus of women aged between 50 and 76 in her show Secheresse et Pluie. Her choice was obviously prompted by the work's subject - the loss of traditional life stories in postwar Vietnam. Yet the women's faces and bodies were marked by so much character and history that they seemed to be more than elderly witnesses to a specific past. Under the choreographer's skilful direction, they became theatrical personalities in their own right. </p> <p>In R\u00e9gine Chopinot's La Danse du Temps, the cast's ages ranged from 20 to 70 and, again, the older dancers did much more than illustrate a theme. By common consent they stole the show, possessing a far surer grasp of Chopinot's slow, looping choreography than the younger dancers. </p> <p>The truth - frustrating though it may be for dancers - is that while their bodies stiffen, their artistry often matures. Christopher Bannerman, a former principal with London Contemporary Dance Theatre, long ago turned 50 but when he recently performed alongside the exquisite south Asian dancer Mavin Khoo he more than held his own. His poignant-comic solo to Saint Sa\u00ebns's Dying Swan was an object lesson in how experience can hone technique and expression to a heroic clarity - which is why 53-year-old Mikhail Baryshnikov still garners almost as many superlatives with his modern dance ensemble White Oak as he did when he was a classical prince. Dancers age better than rock stars. </p> <p>But oldies aren't valued simply for their gravitas. Among the mixed-age, mixed-race cast of Les Ballets C de la B's recent show was a 57-year-old former ballerina who proved as feisty and flighty as anyone else on stage. Diana Payne Myers, star of numerous independent dance shows, appeared in DV8's last production dressed only in a bathing suit. Not only did she cheerfully flaunt all the sags and wrinkles of her tiny 72-year-old body but she also chatted happily about the state of her sex life - which she claimed has never been better, boasting that she had recently had four lovers under 30. </p> <p>Colin McLean, 66, and Gladys Hillman, 76, aren't required to do anything so raunchy when they appear next week in Rosemary Lee's Passage at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, yet they are crucial to the show. Lee cast both these amateur dancers because they possess a style of energy and stage presence she could never have found in younger performers. </p> <p>As a choreographer, Lee has always looked for her material in odd places. She presents work in non-theatrical spaces, mixes amateur dancers with professionals, combines film and live performance and frequently employs children and the elderly. Her aim is to see people performing her work rather than straight dance technicians (though the result is never sloppy) and also to communicate with the widest possible audience. </p> <p>While few serious novelists would admit to writing exclusively about youth, it is standard dance practice to portray humanity only within the twenty/thirtysomething age bracket. Lee feels that when choreographers limit the range of their dancers, they also restrict the range of their audience - older people being less likely to attend shows performed by a much younger generation. </p> <p>Lee is also very alert to everything that older dancers \"carry in their bones\". In purely physical terms she thinks they bring \"a stillness and an authority\" to movement that isn't available to much younger dancers, while she finds them less wary, less closed as performers. Hillman only began dancing at 60, yet Lee says she \"has a serenity and an openness on stage that is extraordinary\".

      "bodyText": "Catwalk models may be getting younger, pop singers may be pre-pubescent and the images of movie stars may be getting more perfectly airbrushed but, in the world of modern dance, wrinkles seem to be the coming thing. There have always been starry individuals who have extended their performing lives way beyond pensionable age. Martha Graham ran the gauntlet of arthritis and alcohol to prolong her dance career until she was 74; at 82, Merce Cunningham has only recently given up being the elderly Puck-turned-Prospero of his own dance creations; and the Japanese star of butoh, Kazuo Ohno, continues to perform at 94. What's special about the present trend is that it involves ordinary dancers, rather than box-office names. A surprising number of recent productions in Britain suggest that choreographers are finding themselves less entranced by the perfect limbs of 20-year-olds than by the dramatic and physical possibilities of bodies that have been lived in. The French choreographer Ea Sola, for instance, made an eloquent case for age when she featured a chorus of women aged between 50 and 76 in her show Secheresse et Pluie. Her choice was obviously prompted by the work's subject - the loss of traditional life stories in postwar Vietnam. Yet the women's faces and bodies were marked by so much character and history that they seemed to be more than elderly witnesses to a specific past. Under the choreographer's skilful direction, they became theatrical personalities in their own right. In R\u00e9gine Chopinot's La Danse du Temps, the cast's ages ranged from 20 to 70 and, again, the older dancers did much more than illustrate a theme. By common consent they stole the show, possessing a far surer grasp of Chopinot's slow, looping choreography than the younger dancers. The truth - frustrating though it may be for dancers - is that while their bodies stiffen, their artistry often matures. Christopher Bannerman, a former principal with London Contemporary Dance Theatre, long ago turned 50 but when he recently performed alongside the exquisite south Asian dancer Mavin Khoo he more than held his own. His poignant-comic solo to Saint Sa\u00ebns's Dying Swan was an object lesson in how experience can hone technique and expression to a heroic clarity - which is why 53-year-old Mikhail Baryshnikov still garners almost as many superlatives with his modern dance ensemble White Oak as he did when he was a classical prince. Dancers age better than rock stars. But oldies aren't valued simply for their gravitas. Among the mixed-age, mixed-race cast of Les Ballets C de la B's recent show was a 57-year-old former ballerina who proved as feisty and flighty as anyone else on stage. Diana Payne Myers, star of numerous independent dance shows, appeared in DV8's last production dressed only in a bathing suit. Not only did she cheerfully flaunt all the sags and wrinkles of her tiny 72-year-old body but she also chatted happily about the state of her sex life - which she claimed has never been better, boasting that she had recently had four lovers under 30. Colin McLean, 66, and Gladys Hillman, 76, aren't required to do anything so raunchy when they appear next week in Rosemary Lee's Passage at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, yet they are crucial to the show. Lee cast both these amateur dancers because they possess a style of energy and stage presence she could never have found in younger performers. As a choreographer, Lee has always looked for her material in odd places. She presents work in non-theatrical spaces, mixes amateur dancers with professionals, combines film and live performance and frequently employs children and the elderly. Her aim is to see people performing her work rather than straight dance technicians (though the result is never sloppy) and also to communicate with the widest possible audience. While few serious novelists would admit to writing exclusively about youth, it is standard dance practice to portray humanity only within the twenty/thirtysomething age bracket. Lee feels that when choreographers limit the range of their dancers, they also restrict the range of their audience - older people being less likely to attend shows performed by a much younger generation. Lee is also very alert to everything that older dancers \"carry in their bones\". In purely physical terms she thinks they bring \"a stillness and an authority\" to movement that isn't available to much younger dancers, while she finds them less wary, less closed as performers. Hillman only began dancing at 60, yet Lee says she \"has a serenity and an openness on stage that is extraordinary\". As for Colin McLean, \"he's a complete live wire - I can't stop him moving.\" She would argue that there's something childlike about McLean's lack of inhibition, except that the real children Lee uses have qualities that are beyond any adult. Apart from their \"amazing quickness\", she finds in them an \"awesome\" capacity for intensity. The point of Passage is to explore the range of energies within a group of disparate people, and certainly Lee's 15-strong cast of professional and amateur dancers includes some extraordinary personalities. When Hillman retired from the civil service she was determined \"not to sit and waste my life away\" and started dancing with an over-60s group.

One lawyer, Alain Leclerc, says he has proof that the Order was \"a massive multinational money-laundering operation\" and that the deaths, far from being \"collective suicides\", were carried out by third parties trying to gain control of its treasure chest. The trial will concentrate mainly on 16 members, including three children, whose burned bodies were found in a remote clearing known as the Well of Hell in an Alpine forest on December 24 1995. The investigating magistrate, Luc Fontaine, has concluded that two cult members administered a sedative to the 14 others, killed them with a single shot to the head, and arranged the bodies in a star pattern before setting the corpses and themselves alight.

Mr Tabachnik knew of plans for the mass killings, it says, and encouraged a \"homicidal dynamic\" among followers in speeches evoking the imminent end of the Order, the \"transit to Sirius\" and the \"return to the Father\" - two of the cult's euphemisms for death.

      "bodyText": "Seventeen-year-old Bassam Zaharan was suspected of wounding an Israeli soldier with a knife. If convicted, he could have been jailed for up to 10 years. But the Palestinian teenager will not be appearing in court or going to prison: Israeli forces shot him dead before he could be put on trial. According to the army, an Israeli soldier \"was lightly to moderately wounded from a Palestinian stab\" at a West Bank checkpoint near Tulkarm early yesterday. The army said the attacker - described as a \"terrorist\" - escaped but was pursued by Israeli forces. \"Forces began searches during which the stabber was found. The force opened fire toward the assailant and killed him,\" a brief statement said. Yesterday, human rights organisations on both sides of the Middle East divide questioned whether Israeli troops had followed their own regulations in dealing with the incident. However, an Israeli army spokesman said that after the teenager was tracked down, he had threatened the soldiers with a knife and they had shot him in self-defence. The body of Zaharan, who had been visiting the West Bank from Jordan, was handed over to Palestinian police. Bassim Eid of the Palestine Human Rights Monitoring Group said: \"Any Palestinian right now who tries to approach an Israeli checkpoint is regarded with suspicion. Some soldiers just open fire. The Israeli version has not been confirmed yet by any Palestinian sources. \"According to their regulations, if he tried to escape they should shoot in the air and then shoot at his legs. It's better to arrest than to kill.\" The penalty for a knife attack would depend on the severity of the injury, but the most serious charge - attempting to kill - would normally result in a seven to 10-year sentence, he added. The Israeli human rights organisation B'Tselem also said it would be investigating the incident, but that \"there are so many cases daily that we can't get to every incident the day it happens\". The organisation said that the rules of self-defence authorise soldiers to shoot to kill during an attack, but not if the assailant is running away. In London, Amnesty International urged the Israeli army to take the soldiers in question off duty in order to investigate thoroughly. \"Only if there is an immediate threat to life are security forces permitted to use lethal force,\" a spokesman added. According to Amnesty, the Israeli army has investigated very few killings by its soldiers. It did examine the killing of a Palestinian woman, Fatima Jamal Abu Jish, as she returned home from the hospital in Nablus where she worked as a receptionist last January. After originally saying that the soldiers had been responding to shots fired at their checkpoint, the army later admitted that no shots had been fired. At the Karni crossing in Gaza yesterday, an Israeli sniper reportedly shot dead another Palestinian, 15-year-old Hamza Obeid, with a bullet through his heart. It was not immediately clear what prompted the killing. A medical worker stationed at what has become a flashpoint for Israeli-Palestinian violence told Reuters: \"He fell dead among his friends. At the time there were no clashes.\" In the Rafah area in southern Gaza, witnesses said a boy, aged 10, had been critically wounded in the head by two live rounds fired from an Israeli tank patrolling the border with Egypt. They said the boy had been shot on the street where he lived as he left home for a private lesson. The Israeli army said it was checking both reports. The killings brought the number of dead to at least 379 Palestinians, 71 Israelis and 13 Israeli Arabs since the Palestinian uprising began last September.

      "bodyText": "\"The Israelis crossed a red line today,\" said Ghassan Khatib, a Palestinian who was involved in the peace process. \"Oslo is dead.\" He was commenting after the Israeli army breached the historic Oslo agreement by occupying territory in the Gaza Strip that had been handed over to autonomous Palestinian control - the so-called Area A - and before the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, announced last night that Israel was pulling pull out. Mr Khatib's pessimism was matched by his counterparts on the Israeli side who helped negotiate the Oslo agreement - signed by the Israelis and Palestinians seven years ago. But Yossi Beilin, a Labour member of parliament who was part of the Israeli delegation at Oslo did not stop believing that the principles that shaped the agreement were still valid. \"I see the conquering of part of Gaza as a big mistake. It is a deterioration of the situation. It deepens the hatred. The last thing we need to do is win the war. We would be back in all the places we wanted to leave,\" he said. He had accused the Israeli prime minister, who decided late last night that the occupation should end quickly, of living in the 1950s, a time when Mr Sharon believed retaliation to be an effective response to Palestinian attacks. In 1955, Mr Sharon led two paratroop companies into Gaza in an operation codenamed Black Arrow that destroyed the Egyptian army headquarters then based there, killing 37 Egyptian soldiers and wounding 31. It is not even two months since Mr Sharon became prime minister, but in that short time the crisis in the Middle East has deepened. Attitudes on both sides have hardened, and the threat of a regional war has re-emerged. Mr Sharon began quietly, the policy of his first few weeks not that different from his predecessor, Ehud Barak. But, facing criticism from the Israeli right for not being tough enough on the Palestinians, who stepped up mortar attacks in the interim, Mr Sharon has opted for tough military action, seemingly in the belief that the Palestinians can be forced to accept a deal. No longer waiting to respond to Palestinian attacks, Mr Sharon in the last two weeks has gone for \"pre-emptive reprisals\": rocket and tank attacks on Palestinian areas, accompanied by bulldozers. And this week Mr Sharon went further, going into Area A in breach of the Oslo peace accord. In part two of the Oslo agreement, signed in 1995, the West Bank and Gaza were divided into three parts: Area A was to be fully under the control of the Palestinian Authority, which was to be responsible for all civil and security matters; Area B was to be under joint Israeli-Palestinian security control; and Area C was to be under Israeli control. Both sides blame one another for having breached Oslo. The Israelis say the Palestinians were to blame for failing to maintain the security necessary to prevent attacks on Israeli settlements. What the Israeli army risked doing with the occupation was make themselves targets in areas that the Palestinians had regarded as sovereign territory. A Palestinian minister, Yasser Abed Rabbo, had warned yesterday that the Palestinian Authority and its people would act in accordance with the reality of the \"re-occupation\" of Gaza. This implicit threat backed up the gloomy assessment of Mr Khatib, now a lecturer in political studies at Bir Zeit University in Ramallah, on the West Bank. He was part of the Palestinian delegation that took part in the Madrid summit and subsequent Washington talks that led to the Oslo agreement. He said he was appalled that the Israeli army had reoccupied a part of Gaza that had been ceded to the Palestinian Authority under the Oslo agreement, and was pessimistic about the chances for peace. \"We have a government in Israel that has policies that go against the legality and philosophy of Oslo. Sharon led the opposition to Oslo and he is now prime minister and has a coalition of people that includes people to the right,\" he said. He said the reoccupation had risked \"Palestinian reaction and resistance which will fuel the vicious circle of violence\". Ron Pundak, an Israeli who was involved in the secret negotiations that led to Oslo and is now head of an economic foundation based in Tel Aviv, said it was not a single event that was damaging Oslo but different and brutal events coming at different angles. It would require hindsight to see whether the agreement had been killed or not. He said there was a saying in Israel that \"every bastard is king\": every member of Hizbullah with a mortar could affect the lives of all Israelis and Palestinians, as could each Israeli soldier who shot at a high-level peace delegation, as happened a fortnight ago. What was needed was for the two societies and their leaders to understand one another. Mr Pundak said: \"I would judge the situation we are in as one of the lowest ebbs in the process since Oslo and it will not be the lowest we will come to in the next few months or more.\" Interactive Israeli map History of Israel Related articles 17.04.2001: Israel blasts Gaza from land, sea and air 17.04.2001: Upset at Sharon son's visit to Arafat 17.04.2001: Lebanon: war's playground once more 15.04.2001: 'The night the tanks took my home' 13.04.2001: The usual Passover in the war zones 09.04.2001, World dispatch: Israel wins war of words 07.04.2001: The dove patrolling on the hawk's wing 06.04.2001: Israeli phone bomb kills militant Useful links Member countries of the Arab League Palestine Times Jordan Times Israeli government Palestinian National Authority",

      "body": "<p>Photographer Richard Young is deeply concerned about <strong> The Psychology Of Fame</strong> (11.0am, Radio 4). As he explains to Dr Raj Persaud, his livelihood depends on it. Over the past 27 years he has attended 125,000 parties to secure saleable snaps. If he only found unknown wannabes there he wouldn't earn a penny. This week's programme examines the industry which has developed around the fame-hungry. It examines the extraordinary network of intermediaries who ensure not only that hopefuls attend the right events, but that everyone is told they did. </p> <p>In the third of <strong> The Reith Lectures 2001</strong> (8.0pm, Radio 4), Professor Tom Kirkwood muses on why women generally live longer than men. From an evolutionary point of view, humans exist solely to reproduce: they have few uses after that. But while the male body steadily deteriorates with age, the menopause noticeably slows that process in females. The reason is unclear but may be because older women can play a significant role in perpetuating the species. </p> <p>Natalie Wheen talks to Nick Dodd in <strong> Tonight At 11</strong> (11.0pm, Classic FM) about next month's Brighton Festival. He is the man in charge of the three-week event, which this year places special emphasis on Japanese culture. Among its offerings will be Japanese textile sculptures (rarely seen in the West) and traditional music by the Ensemble Tokai.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Photographer Richard Young is deeply concerned about The Psychology Of Fame (11.0am, Radio 4). As he explains to Dr Raj Persaud, his livelihood depends on it. Over the past 27 years he has attended 125,000 parties to secure saleable snaps. If he only found unknown wannabes there he wouldn't earn a penny. This week's programme examines the industry which has developed around the fame-hungry. It examines the extraordinary network of intermediaries who ensure not only that hopefuls attend the right events, but that everyone is told they did. In the third of The Reith Lectures 2001 (8.0pm, Radio 4), Professor Tom Kirkwood muses on why women generally live longer than men. From an evolutionary point of view, humans exist solely to reproduce: they have few uses after that. But while the male body steadily deteriorates with age, the menopause noticeably slows that process in females. The reason is unclear but may be because older women can play a significant role in perpetuating the species. Natalie Wheen talks to Nick Dodd in Tonight At 11 (11.0pm, Classic FM) about next month's Brighton Festival. He is the man in charge of the three-week event, which this year places special emphasis on Japanese culture. Among its offerings will be Japanese textile sculptures (rarely seen in the West) and traditional music by the Ensemble Tokai.",

The great, looming evil presence is the negro phallus, which is by itself responsible for pretty much everything. Even - and I won't so much as even try to explain the reasoning - extortionate rates of VAT on consumer durables. </p> <p>This man writes to the Today programme every now and then - presumably directly after vigorous and restorative bursts of ECT - a two-page, tightly typed exposition of his forceful but flawed socio-political analysis. The letters are always - and this is a give-away - cc'd to a vast army of important people: the Pope, George Bush, Javier Solana, Tony Blair, presenters of Watchdog etc. </p> <p>He's an extreme example of what appears to be a growing band of gibbering conspiracy theorists. Why are there so many of them around at the moment, staring at their computer terminals with spinning eyes, as they tap out another email to some like-minded loon in Nebraska or Dushanbe? One answer is the medium itself, of course; the internet's maxim could be a parody of Lord Reith's. Madman shall speak unto madman.

I think Jews and the communists are involved somewhere along the line, too - but definitely in minor roles. The great, looming evil presence is the negro phallus, which is by itself responsible for pretty much everything. Even - and I won't so much as even try to explain the reasoning - extortionate rates of VAT on consumer durables. This man writes to the Today programme every now and then - presumably directly after vigorous and restorative bursts of ECT - a two-page, tightly typed exposition of his forceful but flawed socio-political analysis. The letters are always - and this is a give-away - cc'd to a vast army of important people: the Pope, George Bush, Javier Solana, Tony Blair, presenters of Watchdog etc. He's an extreme example of what appears to be a growing band of gibbering conspiracy theorists. Why are there so many of them around at the moment, staring at their computer terminals with spinning eyes, as they tap out another email to some like-minded loon in Nebraska or Dushanbe? One answer is the medium itself, of course; the internet's maxim could be a parody of Lord Reith's. Madman shall speak unto madman. But maybe there's another reason. Here are a few conspiracies from the Today files for the last six or seven months. \u0095 The foot and mouth epidemic was started by the government in order to scupper the potentially dangerous May Day march by the Countryside Alliance. \u0095 The foot and mouth epidemic was caused by animal rights activists who stole the virus from a government research laboratory. \u0095 The foot and mouth epidemic was started by Saddam Hussein. \u0095 A senior member of the government has a conviction for sexual abuse, but it's all been covered up by the police and the BBC. \u0095 The fuel protests of last Autumn were contrived by the government to deflect attention from the theory above which was \"about to break\".

      "body": "<p>Alec Stock's football career, first as player, mostly as manager, will be remembered above all for four things. His success with non-League Yeovil Town, which put mighty Sunderland out of the 1949 FA Cup; his fruitful, resourceful years as Leyton Orient's manager; his brief, unhappy interlude as assistant manager of Arsenal; and his almost equally brief spell as AS Roma's manager.</p> <p>Stock was a miner's son, born in Peasedown St John, in the Somerset coalfield. After the General Strike, his family moved to Dartford, Kent. At school, Alec became a promising Rugby stand-off half-back, playing soccer in the evenings. When he left school, he worked in a bank, which he detested. Soccer, as an amateur centre-forward, was a consolation. As was cricket. Jimmy Seed, Charlton's manager, watched him score a hat trick in a trial at Tottenham and signed him.</p> <p>The year was 1936. In 1938, without having had a first team game, Stock moved across London to Queens Park Rangers, a club he was destined to manage. An ankle injury hampered his career. When war broke out, he joined an infantry regiment in which he was commissioned. When it became an armoured regiment, he was promoted to captain, commanding a tank, in which he was wounded in the 1944 battle for Caen. He was sent back to Wales to convalesce.</p> <p>Married in 1943, his ambition was to become a bookmaker. Instead, his wife persuaded him to answer Yeovil Town's advertisement for a manager. A shortage of personnel persuaded him to play again, now as an inside-forward on Yeovil's notorious sloping pitch.</p> <p>Yeovil's total wage bill then was a mere \u00a380 a week, but early in 1949 they knocked second division Bury out of the Cup on their helpful slope. Then it was Sunderland, with such stars as Len Shackleton. Stock scored the first goal in a remarkable 2-1 win, although he would later say that the 3-1 win over Bury had given him more satisfaction. Reality intervened when Manchester United beat Yeovil, away from that slope, 8-0 in the next round.</p> <p>The ebullient little East End shoe manufacturer, Harry Zussman, then brought him to Leyton Orient for what was a memorable partnership. Twice Stock left, twice Zussman would get him back.</p> <p>Stock patiently rebuilt a struggling third-division (south) club. He signed and developed local amateurs such as Vic Groves and Stan Charlton, who were profitably sold to Arsenal. Twice Orient went all the way to the sixth round of the FA Cup, losing in 1952 to Arsenal.</p> <p>Stock's tactics were pragmatic and intelligent. A policy of 20-yard passes was followed by one of tight defence, no square balls, and reliance on the zip of the inside-forwards.</p> <p>\"I hate yes men,\" said Stock in 1956, shortly before joining Arsenal. \"I love the boy who comes in and tells me he thinks I'm wrong. He's a man.\" At Highbury, that didn't quite work out.</p> <p>The idea was that Stock would prop up and perhaps succeed Tom Whittaker, pre-war trainer, post-war manager of the Gunners, whose team had fallen on mediocre times. Perhaps Stock over-compensated, addressing the Arsenal players aggressively, telling them that 20 of them would be sold. At one significant moment, he told a younger player, Danny Clapton, to go over to two seniors, goalkeeper Jack Kelsey and captain Dennis Evans, with an ashtray and tell them to stub out their cigarettes. The players tapped their ash into the ashtray, and went on smoking.</p> <p>Soon, to Zussman's delight, Stock was back at Orient, but the following year, he was off again. It began when I received a phone call from Sid Robbins, Orient's chief scout: how could Stock get to Italy? I introduced him to Gigi Peronace, the Calabrian football agent who had just brought off the coup of taking John Charles from Leeds United to Juventus. Peronace convinced Roma that Stock was their man. After a tug of war with Zussman, Roma got their way.</p> <p>But Stock's task in Rome, always so difficult a football city - although another Englishman, Jesse Carver, had recently flourished as the Roma manager - was overshadowed from the first. Roma had appointed as senior executive, Signor Busini, previously a joint selector of the Italian national team, and a notorious intriguer.</p> <p>Never at ease under pressure - at the worst times, attacks of asthma would plague him - Stock perhaps intentionally signed his own death warrant on the occasion of an away match - he missed the train to Naples. Busini and other officials picked the Roma team on the previous train, presenting Stock when he eventually arrived with a fait accompli. He refused to sit on the managers' bench and was sacked the same evening.</p> <p>Back he went to Leyton Orient and Zussman. He went on to QPR (1959-68), Luton Town (1968-72), and Fulham (1972-76), who he memorably took to the 1975 FA cup final, where they lost 2-0 to West Ham. At QPR, with whom he won the League Cup in 1967, he worked harmoniously with a talented coach in Bill Dodgin junior - \"Bill's got that lovely head of white hair\" - although his contribution at training sessions tended to be marginal. \"We'd let him take it for a while,\" said Dodgin. \"Then he'd throw down the whistle and go.\"</p> <p>But Stock was a man always highly estimated by his fellow managers. His wife Marjorie died in 1986, and he is survived by his two daughters.</p> <p>\u0095 Alec William Alfred Stock, football manager, born March 30 1917; died April 16 2001</p>",

Herb 'no cure for depression' A herbal remedy widely used to raise flagging spirits has little effect on people with depression, according to a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association yesterday.

The exhibition introduces younger visitors to the cramped and perilous vessels of the early and mid 20th century. They can try out a bunk bed, view ships through a periscope, detect underwater sounds with a hydrophone, climb a mock-up of a conning tower, and operate an escape chamber. And they will hear of the euphemism used by Mr Gould and his contemporaries for the hundreds of colleagues who died beneath the waves: \"He's still on patrol.\" Mr Gould still has nightmares of cork fillings showering down from deckhead ceilings on Thresher when enemy depth charges exploded; and rats emerging from ducting and staggering about drunkenly, disorientated by the explosions.

      "bodyText": "A senior house officer at a Liverpool hospital negligently killed a two-day-old baby by injecting him with a drug used to treat epilepsy, a court was told yesterday. Kosalakumar Karunaratne, who worked at the Liverpool Women's hospital, is accused of the manslaughter of Adam Teare, a triplet who had been born 11 weeks early at the hospital to Nicola and Keith Teare, of Birkenhead. The doctor has pleaded not guilty to the charge. The jury at Liverpool crown court heard that on the night of his death in February last year, Adam was in an incubator in intensive care. However, he was breathing on his own and had been given an 80% to 90% chance of survival. David Steer QC, prosecuting, said that Dr Karunaratne had just started a night shift at the hospital when he administered the drug. The baby had been due to be given an infusion of caffeine to help his breathing but mistakenly had been given phenytoin. Mr Steer said: \"The defendant is a doctor who it is alleged administered a drug to Adam Teare that should never, ever have been administered. \"The administration of that drug by the defendant amounts to an act of gross negligence such as to render him guilty of manslaughter.\" He said the doctor had breached his duty of care to his patient and it was that which had caused the baby's death. The prosecution claims that Dr Karunaratne negligently gave the drug, which is normally used in the treatment of epilepsy or fitting, wrongly believing it to be sterile water. A nurse noticed from the baby's monitor that his heart rate, breathing and oxygen level had rapidly declined. His condition was compatible with a large overdose of phenytoin, which interferes with the electrical activity of the heart and can slow it to the point where it fails and resists attempts at resuscitation. A consultant neonatologist became concerned that the baby had been injected with the wrong drug, and took blood samples which revealed the presence of the drug. The prosecution alleged that, when interviewed, Dr Karunaratne did not accept he had mistakenly injected the drug. Dr Karunaratne, 36, from Shotton in north Wales, qualified as a doctor in 1991 and had worked at three hospitals before arriving in the UK three years ago. He was a distinguished student in his native Sri Lanka who had received a commendation as best student. He became a member of the Royal College of Physicians in paediatrics in September 1999. He began a six-month posting at the Liverpool Women's hospital on February 2 last year as senior house officer in neonatal paediatrics. The trial continues and is expected to last for three weeks.",

But he added: \"Unless we have some degree of confidentiality and protection for the individual clinician, it will be difficult to succeed in creating a climate in which we can all, genuinely, learn from experience.\" The NHS pays out about \u00a3400m a year in settlements of clinical negligence claims. Infections acquired in hospitals affect about 100,000 patients, of whom 5,000 die.",

The reason why Bank Holidays were so called is technical: bills falling due on Bank Holidays were made payable on the day after the holiday.

      "bodyText": "Prior to the Bank Holidays Act 1871, there were only two days in the year on which all employers customarily allowed their workers time off: Christmas Day and Good Friday (Leader, April 17). A few enterprises also closed on Easter Monday, Whit Monday and Boxing Day, but the army of clerks in banking and commerce remained at their desks. The reason why Bank Holidays were so called is technical: bills falling due on Bank Holidays were made payable on the day after the holiday. It was never suggested that only bank employees should benefit and the act specifically provides that no person could be made to do anything on a Bank Holiday that s(he) could not be made to do on Christmas Day. Changing the name would be a pointless waste of parliamentary time. There is already a power to create additional Bank Holidays by order in council and a new holiday in July, proposed by the act's author 100 years ago, would go some way to redress the imbalance with Europe.

      "body": "<p>For many voluntary organisations, the idea of closing down projects, abandoning long established working practices and relocating staff is a sign of failure. In short, they are reluctant to take tough decisions that would be considered commonplace in the business world. But a supported housing association in the Midlands believes not to do so is a disservice to those it seeks to help. </p> <p>With market forces now unleashed in the field of social care, voluntary agencies can ill afford old-style working practices based on a philosophy of \"if it ain't bust, don't fix it\". Yet in the 1990s, Rob Taylor admits, he typified that approach. As operations director of Adullam Homes, he struggled for five years to keep afloat a flagship residential drugs project until he was finally forced to close it down. He describes it as one of the most difficult decisions he has had to make in his 18-year career in the voluntary sector. </p> <p>That was three years ago. Since then, Taylor, now chief executive of Adullam, has opened and closed other schemes as the Christian-based association has adapted social rehabilitation projects in response to cuts in budgets and the changing needs of users. It now provides housing with support for more than 700 vulnerable people in the Midlands, the north-west, Shropshire and Merseyside. Among them are ex-offenders, drug users, young care-leavers and people with learning disabilities, mental health problems and HIV. </p> <p>\"Too many charities are paying lip service to market forces and are running projects that no longer meet the community's needs,\" says Taylor, who admits it took Adullam seven years to embrace the corporate culture. \"We are in a new reality. Contracts can be won and lost, and the needs of clients change all the time.\" </p> <p>He says Adullam's ethos has always been to provide a resident-focused service, with individual support packages designed to minimise the risk of people regressing into former patterns once they have left the scheme. But he adds: \"We have learnt that where projects are faced with diffi culties that may undermine the association's standards for housing and support, we are prepared to close a scheme and seek alternatives that will better serve the community.\" </p> <p>Such decisions can cause major heartache. Closing the drugs project in Nottingham was particularly difficult, as it had been launched in a blaze of publicity. </p> <p>The former farm on the outskirts of the city catered for men, women and their families. It was the only project of its kind in the area. Yet it never had enough referrals from the local health authority. Differences in approach to treatment - the health authority favouring the 12-step technique, while Adullam embraced a range of programmes - did not help matters. On top of this, health officials considered the 12-month treatment programme too long. </p> <p>Cutbacks were made and the project, which was trying to help the most hardened addicts, was scaled down. Instead of offering a 12-month detoxification programme, the unit moved to a six-month course of treatment. However, cuts to grant money - combined with a shortage of staff of the right calibre - eventually led to the project's closure. </p> <p>Taylor says: \"Psychologically, it was very hard closing the project, even though we lost \u00a3250,000 in the time it was open.There were lots of emotional ties to it.\" </p> <p>Lessons were learned from the closure, which resulted in the setting up of a formal review process for all Adullam projects every two years. At the same time, clients, staff, funders and referring agencies are asked for their views. </p> <p>Examples of this more ruthless and realistic approach are recent decisions to pull out of projects in Rugby and Wolverhampton. These schemes provided beds for people rejected by other agencies because of their instability and personal difficulties. </p> <p>National lottery money was used to build the hostel in Rugby, which was to be managed by Adullam. But problems began shortly after opening, when the local authority refused to pay the rent levels needed to staff the unit effectively. </p> <p>Colin Heath, the association's regional manager, recalls: \"The project was only open for two months when we decided to pull out. On the one hand, we had people expecting us to deliver a service; on the other, we had staff stressed out trying to manage it. The council believed it needed staffing between 9am and 5pm. But staff were saying they needed 24-hour cover because the people in the hostel were so vulnerable. If they left the building for any length of time, there was a risk it would be burnt down.\" </p> <p>Adullam withdrew from the project and handed it over to the housing corporation. The project remains open, under new management, but it no longer takes people with such challenging behaviour. </p> <p>Concerns about inadequate staffing levels lay behind last year's closure of a 24-hour direct access project in Wolverhampton. Set up nine years ago, it was targeted at young people aged 16-25 with drug-related problems, ex-offending backgrounds and mental health needs. Staff gave clients practical help in setting up home, getting jobs, handling crises and maintaining physical and mental health. </p> <p>Over the years, the project was supported by grants from the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and various trusts. However, when these dried up there was an annual shortfall of \u00a360,000. Clients had also become more challenging and the hostel demanded intensive management. As at Rugby two years earlier, understaffing became a problem, exposing workers to unnecessary risk. </p> <p>\"We had staff saying they were working under siege,\" says Heath. \"There weren't enough of them to prevent the frequent damage to the interior, with residents daubing graffiti on the walls, letting off fire extinguishers and kicking in the doors. Windows were being broken by people from the local community who were having a go at people on the pro ject. The stress was such that the project manager had to take three months off sick.\" </p> <p>As yet another attempt to find alternative funding failed, it was decided to close the shelter. </p> <p>This readiness to embrace change and, if necessary, shut down projects that threaten to undermine the association's standards, has made Adullam a leading player in social rehabilitation. Its workforce has grown from 40 to more than 200 over the past three decades and it has won private finance, enabling it to expand further. </p> <p>Taylor believes the secret is simple, and urges others to remember the croquet game in Alice in Wonderland, where the rules altered all the time. \"We have to stay flexible, have more creative manoeuvring and develop closer partnerships with stakeholders than ever before,\" he says. \"Received wisdom has been that, in business, efficiency and innovation cancel each other out. The challenge is to show they can co-exist.

Many said they were no longer in need of a \"high care\" service, which offered 24-hour support. Instead, they wanted practical advice to help them get on with their lives. </p> <p>The accommodation built for the project is scattered across the community. Adullam has deliberately avoided installing disability aids, such as bath hoists, for fear it creates a negative image based on an assumption that clients will inevitably become more unwell.

      "body": "<p>Transforming a century-old former doss house into more than 100 flats in an area with a desperate housing shortage would seem, on the face of it, good news. But critics say that the conversion of Tower House - a brooding, 700-room building in Whitechapel, east London - into \u00a3200,000 apartments will only add to the problems of an area with some of the highest levels of homelessness in the country. </p> <p>Property development is booming in the east end. Workers who want to live just two stops on the Dockland Light Railway from Canary Wharf, and 10 minutes' walk from the City of London, are snapping up factory and warehouse conversions. But this popularity puts more pressure on an area of extreme poverty and high levels of immigration from Africa, Asia and now the former Soviet Union and the Balkans. With fewer empty buildings, the homeless are being forced even further towards the margins. </p> <p>Tower Hamlets council says that more than 8,500 families are living in overcrowded conditions. The council housing sell-offs of the mid-1980s mean that the authority does not have the housing stock to offer transfers, and families cannot afford the \u00a3160,000 cost of a three-bedroom, ex-council flat. In the private sector, Victorian terrace houses have reached the \u00a3500,000 mark. </p> <p>More than 5,000 families are stuck in bed and breakfast \"hotels\" that cost the council \u00a34m last year. And there are 1,130 homeless people - four times the national average - living on the streets, in squats or in derelict buildings like Tower House. </p> <p>From 6 o'clock every morning, for 105 years, Whitechapel Methodist Mission has been providing food, clean clothes, basic medical care and temporary shelter to the street people of the east end. It helps 120-150 people a day and has a strict \"no beer, no glue, no drugs\" policy. Director Tony Miller, who has worked for the mission for 18 years, says the new wave of gentrification is adding to inequality and intolerance. </p> <p>\"Thanks to this government, 'homelessness' is now a dirty word.

      "bodyText": "Transforming a century-old former doss house into more than 100 flats in an area with a desperate housing shortage would seem, on the face of it, good news. But critics say that the conversion of Tower House - a brooding, 700-room building in Whitechapel, east London - into \u00a3200,000 apartments will only add to the problems of an area with some of the highest levels of homelessness in the country. Property development is booming in the east end. Workers who want to live just two stops on the Dockland Light Railway from Canary Wharf, and 10 minutes' walk from the City of London, are snapping up factory and warehouse conversions. But this popularity puts more pressure on an area of extreme poverty and high levels of immigration from Africa, Asia and now the former Soviet Union and the Balkans. With fewer empty buildings, the homeless are being forced even further towards the margins. Tower Hamlets council says that more than 8,500 families are living in overcrowded conditions. The council housing sell-offs of the mid-1980s mean that the authority does not have the housing stock to offer transfers, and families cannot afford the \u00a3160,000 cost of a three-bedroom, ex-council flat. In the private sector, Victorian terrace houses have reached the \u00a3500,000 mark. More than 5,000 families are stuck in bed and breakfast \"hotels\" that cost the council \u00a34m last year. And there are 1,130 homeless people - four times the national average - living on the streets, in squats or in derelict buildings like Tower House. From 6 o'clock every morning, for 105 years, Whitechapel Methodist Mission has been providing food, clean clothes, basic medical care and temporary shelter to the street people of the east end. It helps 120-150 people a day and has a strict \"no beer, no glue, no drugs\" policy. Director Tony Miller, who has worked for the mission for 18 years, says the new wave of gentrification is adding to inequality and intolerance. \"Thanks to this government, 'homelessness' is now a dirty word. The gap between the rich and poor is widening. Next door, you have 26 luxury flats. Across the road, you have the old brewery - grade II listed - now luxury flats. The two-beds are \u00a3270,000. How many east end youngsters can afford that?\" Matters are not helped by confusion over the numbers on the streets. Last year, an official count found just one rough sleeper in Tower Hamlets. \"That's because about 30 of them were in Tower House,\" says Miller. \"Or they were standing outside the tube station with a can of beer, so they weren't classed as sleeping.\" The count was carried out by Petra Salva, who heads the government-funded homelessness team covering the east end.

These days labour is sourced from where it is cheapest - and that means so-called flag of convenience states, such as Panama, where the transport authorities are notoriously lax. Abuses ranging from non-payment of wages to dangerous working conditions are commonplace. </p> <p>For all that, changes in shipping are making it almost impossible for welfare centres to support themselves financially. The income they derive from selling beer, shampoo, phone cards and other small comforts is drying up. As a result, Britain's network of missions is facing the biggest upheaval in its 150-year history. </p> <p>\"Given the quicker turn-round of ships in ports, one has to ask whether there's a need for large seafarer centres on the waterfront,\" says Timo Lappa lainen, of the London-based International Transport Federation (ITF), a grouping of trade unions. This year the ITF will donate \u00a3600,000 to British missions. It wants better value for its grants and is encouraging the movement to re-evaluate how it operates. In some ports this could mean closing a mission and running mobile ship-visiting services. In others, it might mean pooling resources - which again could mean closures. </p> <p>\"It's very challenging for people because the mission building is a physical symbol of their presence at the port,\" says Lappalainen. \"But the mission need not necessarily be a particular address - it's the work, it's encountering seafarers.\" </p> <p>Christian churches operate some 90% of missions worldwide. In this country, the three main providers are the Anglican Missions to Seafarers, which has a network of Flying Angel clubs; the Catholic Apostleship of the Sea, operating Stella Maris centres; and the British and International Sailors Society (Biss), which has clubs representing the Methodist, United Reformed and Scottish churches. At a handful of ports, chaplains from separate denominations have overcome obvious religious differences and started to work together under the same roof. Joint centres have opened at Avonmouth, Felixstowe and South Tees, defeating contentious issues such as whether they should have a condom machine in the toilets. </p> <p>Liverpool, which still has separate Anglican and Catholic missions, plus a Biss club on the Wirral, is typical of a port that is only just beginning to face change. \"We rely heavily on donations,\" says Roy Paul, 42, assistant chaplain at Liverpool's Anglican mission. \"We're surviving by cashing in investments from the sale of a building we used to own in the city centre, but that source will run out.\" </p> <p>The Anglican mission amounts to a homely bar, the centrepiece of which is a karaoke machine and a guitar - singing being a popular form of entertainment with Filipino crews, who account for 60% of the seafarers visiting Liverpool. There is also a chapel. As with missions the world over, this is open to people of \"all faiths and no faith\". </p> <p>With his bushy black beard, Paul looks like a merchant seaman. He grew up in Immingham, on the Humber, and used to accompany the local reverend on ship visits. He now occupies a role somewhere between entrepreneur, civil rights activist and pastoral carer. </p> <p>He recently stepped in to help a Filipino boy crushed by a container - persuading the shipping company to fly the boy's family to Britain, and also sorting out legal representation to ensure fair compensation. He describes a run-in with a captain who was trying to leave port: \"A member of his crew, a Russian man, had just been taken to hospital with a serious head injury. The hospital asked me to find an interpreter - and quickly.\" Using a mixture of stubbornness and moral authority, Paul persuaded the captain to stay. It cost the ship's owner some \u00a310,000 in pilot fees and additional port charges. </p> <p>We visit the Dynamic, a Panama-registered bulk carrier unloading foul-smelling animal feed. Faces light up when we enter the crew's mess. The ratings, all Filipinos, have just made an 18-day transit from New Orleans. The ship is 21 years old and has a Greek captain, with Romanian and Ukrainian officers. The Filipino ratings say the vessel is well maintained, but the interior is as grim as a rundown factory. Apart from the spartan mess, the crew has a room with a pool table - crudely improvised from white laminated wood - and a dartboard. </p> <p>Paul and his assistant, Sean Draper, work their way around the mess, chatting and answering questions. \"Fresh faces are always welcome,\" says Paul later. \"There's only 25 of them and it can be a bit like being in prison - they run out of things to talk about. Some don't even want a lift to the mission - they prefer to walk because they have been in a confined space for such a long time.\" </p> <p>The ITF has commissioned a study into the future of shipping in Liverpool. It is thought it may recommend a joint Anglican/Catholic centre. </p> <p>\"As far as seafarers' welfare is concerned, we already work together very closely,\" says Paul. \"The Stella Maris does have accommodation; we don't. If we need a room for someone, we send them over. I don't know what will happen in the future. We are not attached to this building. It's just a tool that allows us to do our job. If we have to move, so be it.\" </p> <p>There is a greater emotional investment in the Stella Maris - a purpose-built centre that dates from 1962. It feels cold and sterile but its facilities include a canteen, 35 bedrooms, a chapel and a function suite. As Father Pat Harnett, who has run the mission for nine years, points out, the Stella Maris is a monument to the generosity of locals. \"This building was paid for by the pennies of the poor,\" he says. </p> <p>\"There's a case for pooling resources,\" says Harnett. \"I wouldn't have any objections sharing this building, but I don't think something should be imposed from on high. Leaving to go elsewhere would certainly be a wrench - there's the investment of two generations here. But we have to realistic. </p> <p>\"I want to see as much work at grassroots as possible, so that whatever happens evolves naturally. It doesn't always work when you bring two associations together who have different backgrounds. I think it can depend very much on the chaplains in charge at the time - and there's a weakness in that. We do as much as possible. Liverpool used to be like Belfast. It's much better now, but there is still work to be done.\" </p> <p><strong>A haven of help amid disaster</strong></p> <p>Most of the crew of the Derbyshire, the largest British merchant ship lost at sea, came from the north-west of England. The ship sank off Japan in 1980 with the loss of all 44 people on board. The bereaved families were helped by the British International Sailors Society (Biss), which has a club in Birkenhead. The Biss operation, then and now, really amounts to one man - the Rev Peter McGrath, who drives a battered van and spends his days visiting crews on the Wirral side of the river Mersey. </p> <p>McGrath supported the Derbyshire families during their 20-year battle to get an investigation into how a ship, which was almost three times the size of the Titanic, could sink so quickly that the crew did not have time to send a distress call. This campaign finally yielded results last year when a high court judge ruled that the crew was blameless - and that the pride of the British merchant fleet was ill-equipped to survive the typhoon seas it encountered. </p> <p>\"He's a remarkable man,\" says Paul Lambert, of the Derbyshire Families Association, whose brother died in the disaster. \"Peter has been a source of strength and comfort since the day we heard they had lost contact with the Derbyshire. I've lost count of the times I've rung him and found he's out visiting some ship at all hours, taking on board books, food, videos, and just being a friendly face for the crew. I know it's his job, but he goes way beyond the call of duty.\"</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Lord Melchett he ain't. Unlike his predecessor, Steven Tindale, Greenpeace UK's new executive director, has no hereditary peerage, no acres to till, no experience as a Labour government minister - and he has spent only one night in prison (after a demonstration in Brussels). </p> <p>Then again, Tindale is no Swampy either. He is a former civil servant and has certainly not lived down a tunnel to stop a road being built. </p> <p>Tindale, 38, takes over the 200,000-member operation with none of the qualities usually associated with leadership of Britain's most charismatic mainstream environment group. His style is described by colleagues as \"passion masked by coolness\" and \"bright and calm\". In more than 15 years, he has moved between the Foreign Office, Friends of the Earth, the Green Alliance, think-tanks, the Labour party and government, quietly building a reputation for rigour, political intelligence and level-headed determination. </p> <p>His appointment suggests that the organisation, which hangs on to its reputation as the least afraid of upsetting corporate and establishment applecarts, will think a lot, be politically astute and may move into areas that mass membership groups have barely considered for almost a generation. Such as disarmament, an issue he says he has been passionate about since his early days with CND. </p> <p>\"It was my first point of activism. It's essential for us to get more active here,\" he says. The idea of President Bush's revamped Star Wars nuclear \"shield\" around the US, with Britain as an essential listening post, appals him on every level. \"The UK has a crucial role to play\", he says. \"We can stop it happening. It would be ludicrously weak for Blair to just give in.\" </p> <p>So watch out, Ministry of Defence, watch out Fylingdales listening station, and beware New Labour, because Tindale has an intimate knowledge of how the firm and the civil service thinks and acts. He was author of Labour's 1994 In Trust for Tomorrow, which formed the basis of its environment commitments in the 1997 general election manifesto and helped develop Britain's ambitious climate change strategy, as well as the transport white paper, the right to roam and the green tax proposals which Chancellor Gordon Brown has largely accepted. </p> <p>More dramatically, Tindale was midwife at the political rebirth of environment minister Michael Meacher. As his adviser from the moment he took office, Tindale was instrumental in his understanding of the complex social, political and scientific issues of GM, climate change and a host of other issues. He has not looked back since. </p> <p>\"Working in government was an important experience,\" he says. \"I know my way round and how it works. But I also understand the limits of polite and rational politics. You can only get so far with them.\" </p> <p>He left, he says, because of the \"powerful vested interests\" that shape government. </p> <p>But Tindale, a polite and rational man, was briefly a junior diplomat (third secretary, Islamabad) and will not say precisely who pulls the lever of government process. What he will say is that there is \"a mindset\" in politicians of both major parties and especially the civil service, which accepts that business is always right and that the status quo must be maintained. </p> <p>There is a limit to logic and rational argument, he suggests. \"What I realised after 10 years of working in policy-making was that it was not going to get us very far because of the strength of the status quo and the small mindedness of politicians. The voices that the politicians and civil service hear are those of big business. You have the odd, unusual minister, but the mindset is powerful.\" </p> <p>He has been described as a \"policy wonk\", which is misleading, and he promises that Greenpeace will not give up its confrontations or direct actions, nor its mix - developed under Melchett - of high-profile, carrot-and-stick methods. So the balance between identifying the culprits and offering industry and government solutions will continue. He wants Greenpeace to be fearless and, though he does not say it, seems prepared to lead from the front. </p> <p>\"Greenpeace will never be part of the establishment\", he says. \"We engage with government as well as business, but it's not an alternative to confrontation and direct action. The remarkable thing about Greenpeace is that ministers and companies feel they need to talk to us, despite being in confrontation with us.\" </p> <p>He takes over in the middle of the worst rural crisis in a generation, after the worst floods in years, a fuel and rail crisis, the US shredding the global climate agreement, large-scale GM test trials and unprecedented deforestation, mining and destruction in the developing world. But he remains certain that something can be done. </p> <p>\"This is probably a fairly positive time for environment groups,\" he says. \"But we need to remember that it is nowhere near the top of the political agenda. I don't think it's a cynicism in government, so much as a patronising dismissal of the issues. They just don't see environment as serious politics. </p> <p>\"But it's a self-fulfilling prophecy. The politicians say that they don't think the environment is very important; so the focus groups don't mention it; so the politicians don't talk about it. </p> <p>\"At the same time, there is a sense of fatalism with the public, because the politicians don't act.\" </p> <p>Tindale aims to make a mark, but quite how he will change the world remains to be seen.</p>",

His appointment suggests that the organisation, which hangs on to its reputation as the least afraid of upsetting corporate and establishment applecarts, will think a lot, be politically astute and may move into areas that mass membership groups have barely considered for almost a generation. Such as disarmament, an issue he says he has been passionate about since his early days with CND. \"It was my first point of activism. It's essential for us to get more active here,\" he says. The idea of President Bush's revamped Star Wars nuclear \"shield\" around the US, with Britain as an essential listening post, appals him on every level. \"The UK has a crucial role to play\", he says. \"We can stop it happening. It would be ludicrously weak for Blair to just give in.\" So watch out, Ministry of Defence, watch out Fylingdales listening station, and beware New Labour, because Tindale has an intimate knowledge of how the firm and the civil service thinks and acts. He was author of Labour's 1994 In Trust for Tomorrow, which formed the basis of its environment commitments in the 1997 general election manifesto and helped develop Britain's ambitious climate change strategy, as well as the transport white paper, the right to roam and the green tax proposals which Chancellor Gordon Brown has largely accepted. More dramatically, Tindale was midwife at the political rebirth of environment minister Michael Meacher. As his adviser from the moment he took office, Tindale was instrumental in his understanding of the complex social, political and scientific issues of GM, climate change and a host of other issues. He has not looked back since. \"Working in government was an important experience,\" he says. \"I know my way round and how it works. But I also understand the limits of polite and rational politics. You can only get so far with them.\" He left, he says, because of the \"powerful vested interests\" that shape government. But Tindale, a polite and rational man, was briefly a junior diplomat (third secretary, Islamabad) and will not say precisely who pulls the lever of government process. What he will say is that there is \"a mindset\" in politicians of both major parties and especially the civil service, which accepts that business is always right and that the status quo must be maintained. There is a limit to logic and rational argument, he suggests. \"What I realised after 10 years of working in policy-making was that it was not going to get us very far because of the strength of the status quo and the small mindedness of politicians. The voices that the politicians and civil service hear are those of big business. You have the odd, unusual minister, but the mindset is powerful.\" He has been described as a \"policy wonk\", which is misleading, and he promises that Greenpeace will not give up its confrontations or direct actions, nor its mix - developed under Melchett - of high-profile, carrot-and-stick methods. So the balance between identifying the culprits and offering industry and government solutions will continue. He wants Greenpeace to be fearless and, though he does not say it, seems prepared to lead from the front. \"Greenpeace will never be part of the establishment\", he says. \"We engage with government as well as business, but it's not an alternative to confrontation and direct action. The remarkable thing about Greenpeace is that ministers and companies feel they need to talk to us, despite being in confrontation with us.\" He takes over in the middle of the worst rural crisis in a generation, after the worst floods in years, a fuel and rail crisis, the US shredding the global climate agreement, large-scale GM test trials and unprecedented deforestation, mining and destruction in the developing world. But he remains certain that something can be done. \"This is probably a fairly positive time for environment groups,\" he says. \"But we need to remember that it is nowhere near the top of the political agenda. I don't think it's a cynicism in government, so much as a patronising dismissal of the issues. They just don't see environment as serious politics. \"But it's a self-fulfilling prophecy. The politicians say that they don't think the environment is very important; so the focus groups don't mention it; so the politicians don't talk about it. \"At the same time, there is a sense of fatalism with the public, because the politicians don't act.\" Tindale aims to make a mark, but quite how he will change the world remains to be seen.",

She ended up in a secure unit, where she spent over a year. </p> <p>Nicola is now in a care home, and making progress. But she still takes medication three times a day: an anti-depressant, an anti-psychotic and a mood stabiliser.

He says: \"A lot of these issues are going unidentified and they go on then to develop into chronic mental health problems, personality disorders and relationship problems which cause kids to come into trouble with the law.

      "body": "<p>Every few weeks, Terry and Elizabeth Strickland pack a couple of suitcases, close up their four-bedroom house in Lincolnshire and go to live in a mansion in north London, a cottage in Cambridgeshire or a country estate in Buckinghamshire. They may stay for a weekend, or up to a month. </p> <p>They are not lottery millionaires with properties scattered around the country. They are part of a growing army of retired citizens who, for as little as \u00a38.26 a day, watch over other people's homes - and sometimes their precious pets - while they are away on holiday. </p> <p>Money is not the motive, as the Stricklands are eager to point out. Housesitting, they say, has given them a novel way of spending their retirement - a break from routine. </p> <p>\"We treat each sitting like a short holiday,\" says Elizabeth. \"It gets us out and about, travelling around and exploring places we wouldn't normally visit. We love a good walk, so we tend to put on our wellies, particularly if there are dogs to look after.\" </p> <p>Other perks include staying in luxurious properties with a swimming pool and Jacuzzi at their disposal, and gardeners, housekeepers and cleaners milling in the background. </p> <p>It was four years ago, while leafing through a magazine, that the couple came across a recruitment advertisement placed by one of the leading agencies in the industry. Neither had heard of housesitting before but felt it would be a pastime they could enjoy together. </p> <p>Both were formerly in the police force: Terry rose to superintendent rank and his wife worked in administration. These were ideal credentials for some property owners, concerned about burglaries in their area. Reluctant to splash out on security guards, such customers prefer the homely touch of people staying in their homes. </p> <p>And the job is far from arduous. Sitters might be expected to feed the cat, stroke it for half an hour, take the dog for a walk, read the papers, watch the television and catch up on their hobbies. But at all times they must be vigilant. \"People are leaving their treasured possessions, much-loved pets and valuable furniture and property in our care,\" says Terry. \"They need to be able to trust 100% the sitters' integrity and their ability.\" </p> <p>Vetting procedures by house-sitting agencies are rigorous. Despite their backgrounds, it took almost seven months before the Stricklands were given their first assignment. Twenty years of employment history were thoroughly checked out and detailed references sought. </p> <p>Ad\u00e8le Barclay, director of Homesitters, a Buckinghamshire agency that employs the Stricklands, says: \"We're very fussy about the people we recruit. They tend to be in their 50s and 60s, with years of experience of running their own home. They are professional individuals who have been used to shouldering responsibility, and they often say they want the chance to continue that into their retirement.\" </p> <p>Many sitters enjoy the idea of being needed after they have stopped working. They get pleasure from giving a service that guarantees peace of mind and freedom. Barclay says: \"Some of our clients who have pets had never been away. They couldn't contemplate putting their little Pekinese or Great Dane into kennels, and goodness knows what they would have done with the cat or the gerbil. Our sitters take over their homes and, with detailed instructions, look after the animals.\" </p> <p>There is always a preliminary meeting between sitters and their intended client, with no obligation on either side to commit. In accepting a job, though, most sitters have to undertake not to leave the house for more than three hours during the day or one hour after dark. </p> <p>The hours spent in the property do not reflect the money earned. The average rate of pay (for one sitter or a couple) is \u00a350 a week, plus \u00a32 per cat and \u00a35 per dog - more if the pet is exotic or a stabled horse. Out-of-pocket expenses and a food allowance are added. Duties are often calculated to take between two and three hours a day. After that, sitters are considered to be doing what they would normally do in their own home. </p> <p>Until now, this agreeable pastime has never been viewed as exploitative. But a legal challenge by the inland revenue, to be heard next month by a Southampton employment tribunal, argues that sitters are employees. By being in the property, they are available to work at any time and are therefore entitled to be paid for every hour, apart from when they are asleep. Applying minimum wage rules would force pay rates up to \u00a388.80 a day or \u00a3621.60 a week - over and above what the agencies charge owners at present. </p> <p>The agencies have joined forces to protect their business. Richard Atkinson, of Leicester solicitors Spearing Wait, is the lawyer preparing the defence on behalf of a dozen of them. He says: \"This is a ridiculous situation where we have a small industry, which provides a highly valued service, facing destruction because of bureaucratic nonsense. We have to win this case. If we don't, 30 to 40 businesses with thousands of people on their books will be ruined.\" </p> <p>The prospect of losing regular income, however modest, is worrying for Dee and John, sitters who live in Lancashire. They have asked for their surname to be witheld. Both in their 60s, the couple have been pet carers since 1997 for Home and Pet Care, an agency based in north Cumbria. </p> <p>John, a former exhibitions manager, says: \"If this ruling comes in we could lose up to \u00a32,000 a year. It's not a lot, but the extra money has meant we've been able to nurture our love for holidays. With just our pensions to rely on, we won't be able to travel as frequently.\" </p> <p>More than that, they would miss the enjoyment of looking after a range of animals. Dee, who used to be a medical secretary, says: \"We've taken care of cats, dogs, llamas, goldfish, gerbils - you name it. Over the years, we've formed strong attachments with the dogs. We often get asked back to look after of the same pet. </p> <p>\"And we've come across some eccentric owners in our time. There was one who insisted we fed her Alsatian at precisely 7.28 every morning. She was flabbergasted when I suggested 7.30. She even sent a postcard to the creature and told us to read it to him. Another owner expected us to go to bed with the dog every afternoon. And a big black Labrador we sit for twice a year is so jealous he plonks himself between us on the sofa if we so much as hold hands. </p> <p>\"It's all so interesting, we would really miss it.\" </p> <p>Homesitters is on 01296-630730; Home and Pet Care is on 01697-478515.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Every few weeks, Terry and Elizabeth Strickland pack a couple of suitcases, close up their four-bedroom house in Lincolnshire and go to live in a mansion in north London, a cottage in Cambridgeshire or a country estate in Buckinghamshire. They may stay for a weekend, or up to a month. They are not lottery millionaires with properties scattered around the country. They are part of a growing army of retired citizens who, for as little as \u00a38.26 a day, watch over other people's homes - and sometimes their precious pets - while they are away on holiday. Money is not the motive, as the Stricklands are eager to point out. Housesitting, they say, has given them a novel way of spending their retirement - a break from routine. \"We treat each sitting like a short holiday,\" says Elizabeth. \"It gets us out and about, travelling around and exploring places we wouldn't normally visit. We love a good walk, so we tend to put on our wellies, particularly if there are dogs to look after.\" Other perks include staying in luxurious properties with a swimming pool and Jacuzzi at their disposal, and gardeners, housekeepers and cleaners milling in the background. It was four years ago, while leafing through a magazine, that the couple came across a recruitment advertisement placed by one of the leading agencies in the industry. Neither had heard of housesitting before but felt it would be a pastime they could enjoy together. Both were formerly in the police force: Terry rose to superintendent rank and his wife worked in administration. These were ideal credentials for some property owners, concerned about burglaries in their area. Reluctant to splash out on security guards, such customers prefer the homely touch of people staying in their homes. And the job is far from arduous. Sitters might be expected to feed the cat, stroke it for half an hour, take the dog for a walk, read the papers, watch the television and catch up on their hobbies. But at all times they must be vigilant. \"People are leaving their treasured possessions, much-loved pets and valuable furniture and property in our care,\" says Terry. \"They need to be able to trust 100% the sitters' integrity and their ability.\" Vetting procedures by house-sitting agencies are rigorous. Despite their backgrounds, it took almost seven months before the Stricklands were given their first assignment. Twenty years of employment history were thoroughly checked out and detailed references sought. Ad\u00e8le Barclay, director of Homesitters, a Buckinghamshire agency that employs the Stricklands, says: \"We're very fussy about the people we recruit. They tend to be in their 50s and 60s, with years of experience of running their own home. They are professional individuals who have been used to shouldering responsibility, and they often say they want the chance to continue that into their retirement.\" Many sitters enjoy the idea of being needed after they have stopped working. They get pleasure from giving a service that guarantees peace of mind and freedom. Barclay says: \"Some of our clients who have pets had never been away. They couldn't contemplate putting their little Pekinese or Great Dane into kennels, and goodness knows what they would have done with the cat or the gerbil. Our sitters take over their homes and, with detailed instructions, look after the animals.\" There is always a preliminary meeting between sitters and their intended client, with no obligation on either side to commit. In accepting a job, though, most sitters have to undertake not to leave the house for more than three hours during the day or one hour after dark. The hours spent in the property do not reflect the money earned. The average rate of pay (for one sitter or a couple) is \u00a350 a week, plus \u00a32 per cat and \u00a35 per dog - more if the pet is exotic or a stabled horse. Out-of-pocket expenses and a food allowance are added. Duties are often calculated to take between two and three hours a day. After that, sitters are considered to be doing what they would normally do in their own home. Until now, this agreeable pastime has never been viewed as exploitative. But a legal challenge by the inland revenue, to be heard next month by a Southampton employment tribunal, argues that sitters are employees. By being in the property, they are available to work at any time and are therefore entitled to be paid for every hour, apart from when they are asleep. Applying minimum wage rules would force pay rates up to \u00a388.80 a day or \u00a3621.60 a week - over and above what the agencies charge owners at present. The agencies have joined forces to protect their business. Richard Atkinson, of Leicester solicitors Spearing Wait, is the lawyer preparing the defence on behalf of a dozen of them. He says: \"This is a ridiculous situation where we have a small industry, which provides a highly valued service, facing destruction because of bureaucratic nonsense. We have to win this case. If we don't, 30 to 40 businesses with thousands of people on their books will be ruined.\" The prospect of losing regular income, however modest, is worrying for Dee and John, sitters who live in Lancashire. They have asked for their surname to be witheld. Both in their 60s, the couple have been pet carers since 1997 for Home and Pet Care, an agency based in north Cumbria. John, a former exhibitions manager, says: \"If this ruling comes in we could lose up to \u00a32,000 a year. It's not a lot, but the extra money has meant we've been able to nurture our love for holidays. With just our pensions to rely on, we won't be able to travel as frequently.\" More than that, they would miss the enjoyment of looking after a range of animals. Dee, who used to be a medical secretary, says: \"We've taken care of cats, dogs, llamas, goldfish, gerbils - you name it. Over the years, we've formed strong attachments with the dogs. We often get asked back to look after of the same pet. \"And we've come across some eccentric owners in our time. There was one who insisted we fed her Alsatian at precisely 7.28 every morning. She was flabbergasted when I suggested 7.30. She even sent a postcard to the creature and told us to read it to him. Another owner expected us to go to bed with the dog every afternoon. And a big black Labrador we sit for twice a year is so jealous he plonks himself between us on the sofa if we so much as hold hands. \"It's all so interesting, we would really miss it.\" Homesitters is on 01296-630730; Home and Pet Care is on 01697-478515.",

      "body": "<p>Golden rice contains three genes which provide the precursor to vitamin A in the endosperm, that part of the rice kernel we eat. Rice normally does not contain any provitamin A. For the 2.4bn poor rice consumers in developing countries, this leads to vitamin A deficiency. </p> <p>Traditional interventions such as distribution of, and fortification with, vitamin A, dietary education and encouragement for a diversified diet all help - but they still leave us with about 500, 000 blind and 1m dead children a year. We need complementing alternatives. </p> <p>According to the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), the most sustainable solution is to improve the basic food sources with regard to the missing vitamins and micro-nutrients. This goal can be approached with traditional breeding, or with genetic engineering. Provitamin A rice, or \"golden rice\", was not possible with traditional techniques and it is, therefore, a \"GMO\" - a fact that comes with severe consequences. These include intellectual property rights, established rules and regulations, consumer acceptance and hostility from a professional GM opposition. </p> <p>We saw golden rice from the beginning as a humanitarian project, with the final goal to provide it free of costs and limitations to subsistence farmers and the poor in developing countries. </p> <p>It was not developed for and by industry, but in public research institutions, and with exclusively public funding. It will be converted into numerous, locally adapted, varieties in public research institutions in the rice-growing developing countries, and with special emphasis on the needs of the poor. </p> <p>Its introduction will be preceded by careful assessment of country-by-country needs and it will, of course, have to pass all the established GM biosafety assessments. It will be given free of charge and limitations, via national institutions, to resource-poor farmers in developing countries for local use and trade. </p> <p>Its cultivation does not require any additional inputs, avoids the negative side effects of the \"green revolution\", benefits the poor and disadvantaged. It also fulfills an urgent need, can be re-sown from its own harvest, does not reduce biodiversity, does not present any conceivable threat to the environment, and will be made available only if there is no risk to the consumer. </p> <p>There is no \"push\" situation for commercial return, but a \"pull\" situation from malnutrition due to existing vitamin A deficiency. The golden rice technology will also be trans ferred to other major food security crops such as wheat, cassava, sweet potato, banana, grain, legumes and, as mentioned, the trait was only possible through the application of genetic engineering technology. </p> <p>As soon as the scientific problems of engineering the provitamin A biosynthetic pathway into the rice endosperm was solved, the GMO-inherent hurdles had to be overcome to make golden rice available to the poor. </p> <p>The first hurdle was the intellectual property rights involved in the technology. How did industry respond to this challenge?

      "bodyText": "Golden rice contains three genes which provide the precursor to vitamin A in the endosperm, that part of the rice kernel we eat. Rice normally does not contain any provitamin A. For the 2.4bn poor rice consumers in developing countries, this leads to vitamin A deficiency. Traditional interventions such as distribution of, and fortification with, vitamin A, dietary education and encouragement for a diversified diet all help - but they still leave us with about 500, 000 blind and 1m dead children a year. We need complementing alternatives. According to the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), the most sustainable solution is to improve the basic food sources with regard to the missing vitamins and micro-nutrients. This goal can be approached with traditional breeding, or with genetic engineering. Provitamin A rice, or \"golden rice\", was not possible with traditional techniques and it is, therefore, a \"GMO\" - a fact that comes with severe consequences. These include intellectual property rights, established rules and regulations, consumer acceptance and hostility from a professional GM opposition. We saw golden rice from the beginning as a humanitarian project, with the final goal to provide it free of costs and limitations to subsistence farmers and the poor in developing countries. It was not developed for and by industry, but in public research institutions, and with exclusively public funding. It will be converted into numerous, locally adapted, varieties in public research institutions in the rice-growing developing countries, and with special emphasis on the needs of the poor. Its introduction will be preceded by careful assessment of country-by-country needs and it will, of course, have to pass all the established GM biosafety assessments. It will be given free of charge and limitations, via national institutions, to resource-poor farmers in developing countries for local use and trade. Its cultivation does not require any additional inputs, avoids the negative side effects of the \"green revolution\", benefits the poor and disadvantaged. It also fulfills an urgent need, can be re-sown from its own harvest, does not reduce biodiversity, does not present any conceivable threat to the environment, and will be made available only if there is no risk to the consumer. There is no \"push\" situation for commercial return, but a \"pull\" situation from malnutrition due to existing vitamin A deficiency. The golden rice technology will also be trans ferred to other major food security crops such as wheat, cassava, sweet potato, banana, grain, legumes and, as mentioned, the trait was only possible through the application of genetic engineering technology. As soon as the scientific problems of engineering the provitamin A biosynthetic pathway into the rice endosperm was solved, the GMO-inherent hurdles had to be overcome to make golden rice available to the poor. The first hurdle was the intellectual property rights involved in the technology. How did industry respond to this challenge? When we realised that we had used technology burdened by 70 intellectual and trade property rights, we also realised that we needed help from a partner to make golden rice available to resource-poor farmers. We found that partner not in the public domain but in industry. With Zeneca (now Syngenta) we agreed that, in return for the right for commercial exploitation, Zeneca would support our humanitarian project. The border line between \"humanitarian\" and \"commercial\" was set at a generous $10,000 a year income from golden rice. With help from lawyers, the patent figure was brought down from 70 to around 12, and thanks to Zeneca we finally received free licences for \"humanitarian use\" for all intellectual property rights involved.

      "bodyText": "Organisers of the forthcoming anti-capitalism protests in London today dubbed reports of planned violence in the capital as \"Met police propaganda\". Scotland Yard warned this week that protestors have been using US camps to train in civil disobedience, and that they intend to occupy a London landmark building for weeks after the event. But a Reclaim the Streets organiser, \"David\", who refused to give his surname, hit back. He said: \"The police know it's a quiet time at Easter for the media, and so are getting their defences in first. \"It was exactly the same last year, when the 'guerilla gardening' May Day protest was planned. The police told everyone the protestors were using the idea of planting trees in the road as a cover, and would come with pitchforks and spades. That didn't happen. \"The police spent millions of pounds and months of planning on the operation - and yet conveniently 'forgot' to close the McDonalds on Whitehall, right in the centre of the demonstration against capitalism, which was inevitably going to be a target. \"They have to justify their budgets and manpower, so it was very helpful for them that after eight peaceful hours somebody went and graffitied the cenotaph - it justified all their work.\" \"More than 5,000 people turned up for that demonstration, it went on all day, and about 20 people turned nasty and violent - and even that was only after riot police sealed off Parliament Square and refused to let anybody in or out.\" Another protester - who has no part in organising the event - said: \"There is violence orchestrated by the Turkish communists who turn up at these events looking for trouble, but the police don't seem interested in infiltrating them. The real violence is committed by the multinationals we are protesting against.\" Mayor Ken Livingstone - who last year supported the right of the May Day protestors to demonstrate - has this year urged people to stay away from the event. Since last year, the police now have the power under the Terrorism Act 2000 to force peaceful protestors to remove scarves or balaclavas hiding their faces. Last year's demonstrations in Parliament Square and Trafalgar Square turned ugly after several hours of peaceful protest in the centre of Whitehall, which saw sods of grass planted on tarmac roads and cannabis seeds planted in flower beds across from the House of Commons. A McDonalds restaurant was vandalised and slogans were daubed on the cenotaph in Whitehall. A strip of lawn was also placed on a statue of Winston Churchill, giving him a green mohican haircut. This year's protest - which will take place on Tuesday May 1, a working day - is being called Monopoly May Day. A large procession down the heart of Oxford Street, London's busiest shopping street, is planned, although in an effort to confuse the police, few specific details are being discussed.

      "body": "<p>John Zerzan is sweeping the porch of his small cabin-style home in the university town of Eugene, Oregon. It is a glorious, spring, cherry blossom day, and it is hard to imagine that the slight, bearded soul in khaki shorts and a T-shirt bearing the legend \"What goes up must come down\" is really the bete noire of technology and capitalism, the man regarded by the Wall Street Journal as a cross between Fagin and the Antichrist.</p> <p>Zerzan is an anarchist author who believes that our culture is on a death march and that technology in all its forms must be resisted. He corresponds and sympathises with Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber. He believes that civilisation has been a failure and that the system is fast collapsing, and he has been blamed by some for the mayhem at the Battle of Seattle in 1999. This weekend, when it hosts the Free Trade Area of the Americas talks, Quebec City becomes the latest magnet for international protest and a focus for many who are attracted to Zerzan's views.</p> <p>Zerzan seems puzzled by the attention that he and his beliefs, encapsulated in his books Future Primitive and Elements of Refusal, are now receiving. The spotlight first shone on him in 1997 when it emerged that he had visited the Unabomber in jail and that the two shared many beliefs. Kaczynski is serving three life sentences for mail-bomb murders over a 17-year period and is now in a maximum-security prison in Florence, 100 miles south of Denver.</p> <p>\"Unless the revolution gets there, he's there for ever,\" says Zerzan. \"He is in very restricted quarters. For one who found his happiness in nature, you've got to assume that it's awfully hard to live that way. Will there be other Kaczynskis? I hope not. I think that activity came out of isolation and desperation, and I hope that isn't going to be something that people feel they have to take up because they have no other way to express their opposition to the brave new world.\"</p> <p>Interest in Zerzan and his own opposition to that brave new world intensified after Seattle and will doubtless do so again if there is trouble in Quebec City this weekend, although he will not be there personally. \"We got some some credit - or notoriety - over Seattle and a number of us were there, but it's not our priority to be dashing around. I think the question now is whether mass street protests have a big future. Will we go through the ritual of these pre-planned situations in the streets where people get arrested or should we put our energy elsewhere?\"</p> <p>Of Czech origin on both sides of his family, Zerzan grew up in Salem, Oregon. He took degrees in political science at Stanford and history at San Francisco State, then, after a stint as an organiser with a union of social services employees, took postgraduate studies at the University of Southern California. He was active in conventional leftwing politics and was arrested in 1966 for demonstrating against the Vietnam war.</p> <p>Nearly 20 years ago he moved north to Eugene, which has since become something of an anarchist stronghold, with fierce battles fought against gentrification and development. In June 1999, not long before Seattle, a march following a two-day anarchist conference in Eugene led to a bloody riots and arrests. One anarchist was jailed for seven years for assaulting police with a rock.</p> <p>As one would expect there is no car outside Zerzan's home - he cycles. There are no credit cards in his wallet, nor computers on his desk. He has financed his writing by selling his own blood plasma, but now makes his living doing odd jobs and babysitting. He is working on a \"mini memoir\". His books are accessible, his frames of reference encompassing everyone from Robert Louis Stevenson and William Morris to Jean Baudrillard and Euclid.</p> <p>He does volunteer work with disabled people in the weights rooms of the local YMCA and has a programme on KWVA, the local campus station, on which he plays everything from classical to hip hop. He lives in a housing cooperative, of which he is currently the president: \"I get a lot of grief for that - 'Mr Anarchist President'.\" He was married and has a daughter, whose picture sits on a shelf in his modest front room with its chess board and shelves of books.</p> <p>Zerzan has been described by critics as one of those anarchists who \"carry a black flag in one hand and a welfare cheque in the other\", to which he replies that he doesn't know anyone on welfare. He is also often portrayed as part of the \"hunter-gatherer\" wing of anarchism, so how would he describe his views?</p> <p>\"It's the effort to understand and do away with every form of domination, and that involves questioning very basic institutions, including the division of labour and domestication upon which the whole edifice of civilisation and technology rests ... If you took away division of labour and domestication you might have something pretty close to what obtained for the first two million years of the species, during which there was leisure time, there was quite a lot of gender equality and no organised violence - which doesn't sound too bad. They say: 'Oh, you want to be a caveman.' Well, maybe that's somewhat true.\"</p> <p>He says that he got used to \"the whole primitivist thing\" being used in quotation marks and that it makes him cringe. \"Now I guess the quotes are off, but all of these labels seem like the same old 'I'm a this and I'm a that'. In America it's very, very popular to be 'anti-ideological'. Everyone says: 'Oh, I'm not ideological.' When Americans say they're not ideological, it just means they accept the basic system or that they're not political.\"</p> <p>Some of the protesters at Seattle took issue with Zerzan and the young, black-clad Eugene anarchists who smashed windows. One liberal Seattle commentator said he would have spat in Zerzan's face after the riots if he had seen him because the wrecked shop fronts had detracted from the main business of closing down the World Trade Organisation talks. Zerzan replies: \"It took Seattle to break the ice. The fact that people got out there and rumbled. You can hold up signs at demos and little rallies and that'll do nothing. I wish good ideas would just wonderfully work their magic but good ideas are worth nothing if you can't back it up.\"</p> <p>But it is specifically his voicing of opposition to new technologies that has brought him prominence, with detractors and admirers. \"The idea of technology being a neutral, discreet thing and whoever is in charge can use it this way or that way, that's really missing the point. It's inseparable from the system, it's the incarnation of the system and it's always been that way. You can't take a totally alienating technology and use it for anything except more alienation, more destructive impact on every level from the psyche to the rest of the biosphere. Globalisation is a kind of buzz word at the moment and once again the lefties have come up with a soft core thing. Globalisation is nothing new; what's happening now is just the latest round of excesses.\"</p> <p>Zerzan says he objects to being portrayed as someone leading an army of young anarchists into battle. \"People think I'm trying to push everybody into wild stuff but I'm more worried about people staying out of jail. This is not a game. There has been some heavy stuff already and there will be more.\" He always disagreed with Kaczynski on the issue of violence against living creatures and says that the same is true of his fellow anarchists in Eugene and of the Earth Liberation Front, which has recently been burning down properties built as part of an urban sprawl. \"Property destruction as a tactic is a totally different thing and we're way in favour of that, but that is not violence.\"</p> <p>But if Zerzan has been the butt of attacks from the conservative media, he also has few friends on the organised left. \"One of my pet peeves is that the left shows no interest in these things. It deserves to go extinct. It is never going to extend or deepen its critique and that's fine with me because it's kind of an albatross and it's failed so deeply.\"</p> <p>He does not, he says, \"throw out all of Marx, the class struggle, all that we take for granted\". But he includes in his condemnation \"liberals, Marxists, members of left parties, Noam Chomsky, the anarchist left, the syndicalists, the Wobblies, all those people who think technology is fine and it just depends on how you use it and that there's nothing wrong with development and the industrial system, it just depends who's running it.\"</p> <p>He is aware of the contradiction of a movement that despises hierarchies having one figure who is becoming as prominent as he is. \"I'm not handling this well - if you have one person all over the place that really is in contradiction to the anarchy idea, so we're trying to get away from that, but here we are! I'm always speaking for myself - I'm not speaking for all anarchists.\"</p> <p>But is it not the case that much of the protest movement now is fuelled by communication on the internet in a way that would otherwise be impossible? \"That's another of the contradictions. It is true, for example, that many more people have read my stuff [on the internet] than have bought the books, and that's fine ... Many people I know do use it for instant communication, for coordinating things. You can get anarchist news daily in 12 languages on what is going on today in Greece or wherever and that is an obvious service. I don't even have a computer, but I think you can use it without succumbing to it.\" He does have a television set, and contributes to the underground Radio Free Cascadia and cable access shows. \"Everyone needs to veg out at times and television's not as bad as hard drugs.\"</p> <p>There is an ongoing debate, he says, about whether one should even bother talking to the media. Three years earlier, he says, the Wall Street Journal had come to Eugene and talked to everybody, including the parents of many of the younger anarchists, and had then written \"the most scurrilous, inaccurate article. I still marvel at it. All false stuff about how these kids were all runaways and how they were going to set bombs, just nutty stuff ... Some people wouldn't talk to you or anyone from the straight media, just wouldn't do it. Some of us argue that people can read between the lines and if they cut the thing or if it's somewhat spun, people understand.\"</p> <p>He has recently been in Europe, in Spain and England, and the trip has enthused him. \"More and more people are ready for some movement that is pitched at a deeper level. I was kind of surprised at how many people wanted to talk about Seattle ... I don't want to dwell on Seattle and yet that was an inspiring thing around the world, the opening battle of a new movement, so to speak.\"</p> <p>He sees the spate of school shootings and the the vast increase in teenage suicides in America as a sign of a system reaching breaking point: \"There are even higher incidents of homicide at work; that didn't happen when I was a kid. My dad was an NRA [National Rifle Association] lifetime kind of guy and we had all kinds of guns in our house, but no one dreamed of taking a gun to school ... Travelling around, boy, I think people are so fed up with things. On the train last August I was overhearing all kinds of things. People were talking about how bugged they are - they've got their beepers and their cellphones, they don't have a second's rest any more - and these were just straight people.\" He abhors what he sees as a world in which much of someone's day is spent gazing through a screen - a TV screen, a computer screen, a car windscreen.</p> <p>But while it is not hard to imagine returning to utopian simplicity on a gorgeous day in Eugene, where the Red Barn Organic Grocery noticeboard offers handmade moccasins and didgeridoo sound therapy, what relevance does all the theory really have for someone living in the middle of Detroit or east Los Angeles?</p> <p>\"It's a huge challenge,\" Zerzan admits. \"You 've got these great grandiose ideas, but the rubber has to hit the road somewhere, and we know that. I don't know how that's going to work.\" He cites small movements such as Food not Bombs, guerrilla gardening and Cafe Anarchista, and praises magazines such as Adbusters, Anarchy Magazine, Fifth Estate and the Earth First Journal.</p> <p>\"But we are a long way from connecting with that reality and we have to face that. You start off with questioning things and trying to enlarge the space where people can have dialogue and raise the questions that are not being raised anywhere else. But we don't have blueprints as to what people should do.\"</p> <p>He is not alone in his disquiet. Last year, in a fascinating treatise in Wired, Bill Joy, the co-founder of Sun Microsystems, one of whose friends was a victim of Kaczynski, said that although he believed that the Unabomber's actions had been criminally insane, there had been some merit in the case he made against a headlong technological rush to the future. He and Zerzan have since corresponded.</p> <p>Zerzan comes to the porch to bid farewell. A cat is chasing a squirrel. The squirrel escapes. \"They always get away,\" says Zerzan admiringly as the untamed, free-spirited creature runs rings around its domesticated pursuer.</p> <p><b>Related special report</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/wto/\">World Trade Organisation</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.spunk.org/library/writers/zerzan/\" target=\"_NEW\">Anarchist library</a><br><a href=\"http://www.subsitu.com/kr/fpjz.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">Future Primitive</a><br><a href=\"http://www.primitivism.com/zerzan.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">Interview with John Zerzan</a><br><a href=\"http://www.primitivism.com/primitivism.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">Primitivism.com</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.t0.or.at/zerzan/politon.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">Tonality and Totality</a><br><a href=\"http://www.stopftaa.org/\" target=\"_NEW\">Stop the FTAA</a><br><a href=\"http://www.protest.net/\" target=\"_NEW\">Protest Net</a><br><a href=\"http://www.wto.org/\" target=\"_NEW\">World Trade Organisation</a><br></p>",

Some of us argue that people can read between the lines and if they cut the thing or if it's somewhat spun, people understand.\" He has recently been in Europe, in Spain and England, and the trip has enthused him. \"More and more people are ready for some movement that is pitched at a deeper level. I was kind of surprised at how many people wanted to talk about Seattle ... I don't want to dwell on Seattle and yet that was an inspiring thing around the world, the opening battle of a new movement, so to speak.\" He sees the spate of school shootings and the the vast increase in teenage suicides in America as a sign of a system reaching breaking point: \"There are even higher incidents of homicide at work; that didn't happen when I was a kid. My dad was an NRA [National Rifle Association] lifetime kind of guy and we had all kinds of guns in our house, but no one dreamed of taking a gun to school ... Travelling around, boy, I think people are so fed up with things. On the train last August I was overhearing all kinds of things. People were talking about how bugged they are - they've got their beepers and their cellphones, they don't have a second's rest any more - and these were just straight people.\" He abhors what he sees as a world in which much of someone's day is spent gazing through a screen - a TV screen, a computer screen, a car windscreen. But while it is not hard to imagine returning to utopian simplicity on a gorgeous day in Eugene, where the Red Barn Organic Grocery noticeboard offers handmade moccasins and didgeridoo sound therapy, what relevance does all the theory really have for someone living in the middle of Detroit or east Los Angeles? \"It's a huge challenge,\" Zerzan admits. \"You 've got these great grandiose ideas, but the rubber has to hit the road somewhere, and we know that. I don't know how that's going to work.\" He cites small movements such as Food not Bombs, guerrilla gardening and Cafe Anarchista, and praises magazines such as Adbusters, Anarchy Magazine, Fifth Estate and the Earth First Journal. \"But we are a long way from connecting with that reality and we have to face that. You start off with questioning things and trying to enlarge the space where people can have dialogue and raise the questions that are not being raised anywhere else. But we don't have blueprints as to what people should do.\" He is not alone in his disquiet. Last year, in a fascinating treatise in Wired, Bill Joy, the co-founder of Sun Microsystems, one of whose friends was a victim of Kaczynski, said that although he believed that the Unabomber's actions had been criminally insane, there had been some merit in the case he made against a headlong technological rush to the future. He and Zerzan have since corresponded. Zerzan comes to the porch to bid farewell. A cat is chasing a squirrel. The squirrel escapes. \"They always get away,\" says Zerzan admiringly as the untamed, free-spirited creature runs rings around its domesticated pursuer.
