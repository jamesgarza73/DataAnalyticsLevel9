      "body": "<p> Neko Case and Her Boyfriends are making their UK debut in a house of God. But a blast of feedback brings them down to earth. \"What the fuck is that?\" asks Case in an exasperated voice. Probably not the best way to assure a place in heaven, but then Case doesn't pretend to be holy. An ex-punk drummer who realised her heart was a lot more country, a little less rock'n'roll, she has looked back to the good ol' days when Loretta Lynn made it hip to be a country chick and given it a modern twist. Where once your man broke your heart and left you crying, Case is more likely to find him, seduce him - and then drown him. </p> <p>With her long, red flowing hair and short, red velvet dress, Case isn't your standard country gal. She's strikingly reminiscent of Janis Joplin, shoulders back, eyes skyward, a woman who knows she's good. And then there's the voice.

But a blast of feedback brings them down to earth. \"What the fuck is that?\" asks Case in an exasperated voice. Probably not the best way to assure a place in heaven, but then Case doesn't pretend to be holy. An ex-punk drummer who realised her heart was a lot more country, a little less rock'n'roll, she has looked back to the good ol' days when Loretta Lynn made it hip to be a country chick and given it a modern twist. Where once your man broke your heart and left you crying, Case is more likely to find him, seduce him - and then drown him. With her long, red flowing hair and short, red velvet dress, Case isn't your standard country gal. She's strikingly reminiscent of Janis Joplin, shoulders back, eyes skyward, a woman who knows she's good. And then there's the voice. While Case has forsaken the pouty Shania antics, her voice has a warmth and depth shared by Patsy Cline. But where kd lang tried for a sweet copy of country's greatest female vocalist, Case has taken the legacy and run with it.

The very secular, sometimes downright smutty, part-songs that made up their programme would originally have been performed in various stages of inebriation during or after a long evening's dining. With this in mind, the group always sings seated around a table. On this occasion, though, this didn't add any atmosphere as the best table that could be found in the Queen Elizabeth Hall was a flimsy thing draped with a black cloth, bringing to mind a hastily arranged press conference. </p> <p>Their presentation may not have been so polished, but their performance certainly was slick and very entertaining. Two lengthy, rollicking hunting songs had the singers barking like dogs and bleating like sheep as Bellocq played on solemnly, while the four-part Fricass\u00e9e, with each performer singing different words, was a classic example of how a song of this period can seem piously honourable on the surface when it's actually pretty filthy underneath. </p> <p>The ensemble are utterly attuned to one another's voices, and their intonation for the first few songs at least was astonishingly pure (though it later wavered slightly). It was the countertenor and director Dominique Visse whose voice was dominant. In the best sense, his voice is like a razor, cutting cleanly through thick vocal textures - it's a very pure sound, with an amazing amount of edge without being harsh. For most of this repertoire no one voice is supposed to dominate the group, but Visse's individual tone makes a large contribution to the ensemble's character. </p> <p>After all this schoolboy humour, the courtly love songs of soprano Maria Cristina Kiehr's recital over in the Purcell Room were a complete contrast. Accompanied by harpsichordist Jean-Marc Aymes, Kiehr communicated her programme of 17th-century Italian songs and monologues gently but effectively, with a limpid, ringing tone. </p> <p>However, the most direct, expressive singing of the day came from Val\u00e9rie Gabail, performing in a programme of 18th-century French music with Les Talens Lyriques. Led by Christophe Rousset at the harpsichord, the group gave an involving recital, with every phrase musically and thoughtfully played. </p> <p>Whether duetting with Gabail or playing as soloist in Leclair's Sonate 4, St\u00e9phanie-Marie Degande's violin had a broad, sustained tone and a heightened sense of expression, while cellist Astushi Sakai, by turns lyrical and virtuosic, was strong in his support.

Rather than selling shares at the so-called \"mid-price\", the trader entered \"at best\" into his terminal, causing Deutsche's computers to trade at any price where a buyer could be found. </p> <p>It could not have come at a worse time for the London Stock Exchange, which is trying to repel a hostile takeover from OM Gruppen, owner of the Swedish stock exchange. OM yesterday published its offer, again highlighting the effi ciency of its trading technology. Chief executive Per Larsson said: \"Our offer today brings state-of-the-art technology, clarity and real commercial drive that will secure London as Europe's leading exchange.\" </p> <p>However, London rejected OM's approach and said the offer was deeply flawed: \"OM's proposal represents a cul-de-sac for the UK market.

A B\u00f6rse spokesman said no new date had been fixed and insisted all options were being kept open. </p> <p>But Rolf Breuer, the supervisory board chairman of Deutsche B\u00f6rse, said the directors were still behind the merger plans and called it \"the most attractive option\". </p> <p>The move came on the day the New York-based Nasdaq market was rumoured to be poised to join OM's bid.

Rather than selling shares at the so-called \"mid-price\", the trader entered \"at best\" into his terminal, causing Deutsche's computers to trade at any price where a buyer could be found. It could not have come at a worse time for the London Stock Exchange, which is trying to repel a hostile takeover from OM Gruppen, owner of the Swedish stock exchange. OM yesterday published its offer, again highlighting the effi ciency of its trading technology. Chief executive Per Larsson said: \"Our offer today brings state-of-the-art technology, clarity and real commercial drive that will secure London as Europe's leading exchange.\" However, London rejected OM's approach and said the offer was deeply flawed: \"OM's proposal represents a cul-de-sac for the UK market. The offer provides nothing new for our shareholders to consider.\" Germany's Deutsche B\u00f6rse last night delayed a vote on plans to merge with the London exchange after OM officially tabled its terms. The ballot of shareholders, due to be held on Thursday, was postponed following a board meeting yesterday afternoon. A B\u00f6rse spokesman said no new date had been fixed and insisted all options were being kept open. But Rolf Breuer, the supervisory board chairman of Deutsche B\u00f6rse, said the directors were still behind the merger plans and called it \"the most attractive option\". The move came on the day the New York-based Nasdaq market was rumoured to be poised to join OM's bid. Neither company was prepared to comment on the speculation.",

But they lacked the pace, movement and invention to worry Fabien Barthez, who might as well have been cruising in the Med with Linda Evangelista for all he had to do. </p> <p>That is, until the 75th minute. Emerson Thome headed a Sunderland corner goalwards and Niall Quinn helped it on. But, just as the ball looked to be heading over the line, Barthez's arm appeared from nowhere to push it away. From spectator to saviour: the true test of a great goalkeeper. </p> <p>Annoyed by such impudence, United marched down the other end to put the match beyond reach, Cole setting up Teddy Sheringham for his third goal in four days. Scholes added a third with a screamer from 20 yards to end another day at the office for United. </p> <p>Reid's team have now slipped to third bottom and his troubles were not helped by the thought that this was not even United's full-strength side. Roy Keane was suspended, Dwight Yorke injured - though there was some suspicion he was being disciplined for returning late from international duty - and Jaap Stam was taken off at half-time with an achilles problem. </p> <p>Reid would also probably shake his snow-capped head in amazement at the thought that Ferguson is still looking to sign another defender, with Lazio's Portugal international Fernando Couto a possible target. </p> <p>So, while Ferguson remains modest about United's title chances - \"The best time to judge is the new year when all the big guns have played each other\" - Reid has no doubts. \"Who will win the title?

They seem to be approaching their football this season as a game of two halves, except that one half is their attack, the other their defence. Their attack, spearheaded by Emile Heskey and Michael Owen, who could both lead the England line against Germany on October 7 (although please God not with Nicky Barmby), is irresistible. Their defence, charged with protecting a panicky goalkeeper Sander Westerveld, whose attitude to crosses is Transylvanian - he shrivels in a corner and dies when he sees one - is all over the place. Liverpool have already distinguished themselves by letting slip one three-goal lead, at Southampton. Against Manchester City on Saturday they tried a different permutation, scoring two, letting in two, scoring again and then being fortunate to see Alf-Inge Haaland's \"goal\" disallowed in the 85th minute after Westerveld dropped another cross. \"Liverpool are a good young team but they made too many mistakes,\" explained the former world player of the year George Weah. \"They looked slack at the back and every time the ball went into the box it looked like we were going to score.\" Defences may be becoming more generous but a team with title expectations can usually afford to let in only 40 or so goals in total.

      "body": "<p>So much good football flows on the banks of the Thames, so great is the potency in Fulham's attacking positions that it is almost possible to understand referees wanting to give the opposition a helping hand. </p> <p>Yesterday Andy Hall allowed Barnsley's Mitch Ward to remain on the pitch despite showing him a second yellow card. It had been an unequal struggle with 11 v 11, so why load the scales further in favour of Jean Tigana's trailblazers? </p> <p>So engrossing had been the spectacle provided by a fifth successive victory and the ritual dismantling of another sacrificial back line that even Fulham's own supporters had failed to notice Hall's mistake. </p> <p>Four minutes elapsed before the fourth official brought it to the attention of the man sporting black and now a red face as well. Off, belatedly, went Ward, shown, bizarrely, a third yellow followed by red from the Birmingham referee. </p> <p>Fulham were so superior as they maintained their faultless pursuit of maximum points that they gave no suggestion that they were weaker for the absence through injury of the man who has sourced so many of their ideas, the former Scotland international John Collins. </p> <p>Starting a First Division fixture for the first time in his place was Fabrice Fernandes and he splendidly contributed to their devastating rhythms as the Londoners resumed their place on top of the table with all the ease of a Sunday stroll. </p> <p>Yet it was his fellow Frenchman Louis Saha who drew most credit from this perfor mance with a first-half hat-trick that began on six minutes when he headed home Fernandes' free-kick. </p> <p>There was so little resistance it was a wonder that another 24 minutes passed before Saha stroked in his second after Barry Hayles had seen his shot kept out by Keith Miller. </p> <p>In between Mike Sheron put the ball into the net only for an offside flag to be raised - errantly, according to Dave Bassett after watching television replays - and the same player also scooped over an invitation to equalise. </p> <p>\"I was not too disappointed with our first-half display but clearly at 3-0 down the deckchairs are up and the cigars are out and they gave us a torrid second half,\" admitted the Barnsley manager. </p> <p>On the Ward oversight Bassett added: \"Nothing surprises me in football. But, to be honest, I'm much more concerned the officials see other things such as offside decisions.\" </p> <p>Saha's third before the break came from a penalty after Hayles, first executing an audacious Pele-style feint, fed Bjarne Goldbaek, who was brought down by Miller. The referee got his card selection exactly right on that occasion, showing the goalkeeper yellow. </p> <p>During Barnsley's \"torrid\" period Fulham scored twice but that was a meagre return for the number of times they sliced apart the defensive cover. </p> <p>Fernandes hit the post and Hayles twice went close before scoring from Saha's low centre. Greed and complacency set in but there was a fifth for the substitute Luis Boa Morte at the end after Matt Appleby had rolled in a solitary reply. </p> <p>Even now Fulham had sufficient energy to head off for the swimming baths and a warm-down.</p>",

      "bodyText": "So much good football flows on the banks of the Thames, so great is the potency in Fulham's attacking positions that it is almost possible to understand referees wanting to give the opposition a helping hand. Yesterday Andy Hall allowed Barnsley's Mitch Ward to remain on the pitch despite showing him a second yellow card. It had been an unequal struggle with 11 v 11, so why load the scales further in favour of Jean Tigana's trailblazers? So engrossing had been the spectacle provided by a fifth successive victory and the ritual dismantling of another sacrificial back line that even Fulham's own supporters had failed to notice Hall's mistake. Four minutes elapsed before the fourth official brought it to the attention of the man sporting black and now a red face as well. Off, belatedly, went Ward, shown, bizarrely, a third yellow followed by red from the Birmingham referee. Fulham were so superior as they maintained their faultless pursuit of maximum points that they gave no suggestion that they were weaker for the absence through injury of the man who has sourced so many of their ideas, the former Scotland international John Collins. Starting a First Division fixture for the first time in his place was Fabrice Fernandes and he splendidly contributed to their devastating rhythms as the Londoners resumed their place on top of the table with all the ease of a Sunday stroll. Yet it was his fellow Frenchman Louis Saha who drew most credit from this perfor mance with a first-half hat-trick that began on six minutes when he headed home Fernandes' free-kick. There was so little resistance it was a wonder that another 24 minutes passed before Saha stroked in his second after Barry Hayles had seen his shot kept out by Keith Miller. In between Mike Sheron put the ball into the net only for an offside flag to be raised - errantly, according to Dave Bassett after watching television replays - and the same player also scooped over an invitation to equalise. \"I was not too disappointed with our first-half display but clearly at 3-0 down the deckchairs are up and the cigars are out and they gave us a torrid second half,\" admitted the Barnsley manager. On the Ward oversight Bassett added: \"Nothing surprises me in football. But, to be honest, I'm much more concerned the officials see other things such as offside decisions.\" Saha's third before the break came from a penalty after Hayles, first executing an audacious Pele-style feint, fed Bjarne Goldbaek, who was brought down by Miller. The referee got his card selection exactly right on that occasion, showing the goalkeeper yellow. During Barnsley's \"torrid\" period Fulham scored twice but that was a meagre return for the number of times they sliced apart the defensive cover. Fernandes hit the post and Hayles twice went close before scoring from Saha's low centre. Greed and complacency set in but there was a fifth for the substitute Luis Boa Morte at the end after Matt Appleby had rolled in a solitary reply. Even now Fulham had sufficient energy to head off for the swimming baths and a warm-down.",

It added: \"Rovers' directors, management and players feel an injustice was done and would like Notts County to follow the example of Arsenal two years ago and request the game be replayed.\" Ian Holloway, the Rovers manager, said: \"I feel so strongly that I am willing to put at risk the away point which we gained.\" Rotherham took an early lead at Cambridge when Mark Robins scored his sixth goal of the season. Then Ian Ashbee (2), Tom Youngs (2) Zema Abbey and James Axel dal replied in a 6-1 rout as Roy McFarland's side moved up to fourth. Brentford's poor run continued with a 4-0 beating at fifth-placed Reading, where Jamie Cureton hit a hat-trick to take his tally to seven. Darren Caskey added a penalty. Simon Haworth was another hat-trick scorer as Wigan beat Colchester 3-1, the reply coming from Karl Duguid. Millwall left it late, Neil Harris striking in the 89th minute for a 1-0 victory win over Swansea . Stoke secured their first home win as goals from Kyle Lightbourne, Stefan Thordarson and Graham Kavanagh beat Peterborough . Alarming times at Ashton Gate, where Danny Wilson's Bristol City fell 1-0 to a late goal from Alan Reeves in the derby with Swindon.",

      "body": "<p>As New Labour approached mid-term in government, a group of women began meeting to ask some awkward questions. Why had the triumph of 100 women in parliament become a sorry joke? Why had Downing Street begun to feel like an exclusive boys' club? Why had feminism become a dirty word, even with the newly appointed Minister for Women?</p> <p>Most of us were supporters of New Labour and a few were Labour MPs. But we feared that, now the party was in government, it had lost the plot as far as women were concerned. Last week's announcement by Mo Mowlam that she is quitting politics seems to justify our concerns that the government has been squandering its female assets.</p> <p>If New Labour wanted to consolidate its gains, we believed, it would have to become more gender-aware and egalitarian in its own internal practices as well as in its politics.</p> <p>Out of those meetings came a book, New Gender Agenda, published today by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), the Fawcett Society and the Fabian Society in which prominent figures (male and female) - in politics, academia and journalism call for a more constructive engagement between government and feminism, and explore the practical implications as we approach the next election.</p> <p>Today's Mori poll, commissioned by IPPR, confirms two of the book's key themes. The first is that, contrary to received wisdom in Labour's higher echelons, feminism is in tune, not out of step, with today's electorate. Major issues on which feminists have long campaigned - for childcare and an equal voice in politics - are considered important by, respectively, 88 and 86% of Mori's respondents. The second theme is that women are less likely than men to trust the government to deliver on the issues that affect them most. Only 52% say they are confident that Labour will allow women politicians an equal say .</p> <p>Deborah Mattinson, a leading authority on opinion research, reminds us that women have always been more likely to vote Conservative, tending to see Labour as masculine and old-fashioned. They switched to Labour in 1997 because they liked Blair's fresh style and the influx of women MPs. But their support is tentative and conditional. If they see signs of the party reverting to \"business as usual\", they will swiftly lose faith. The hostile reception of the Women's Institute to Tony Blair at their conference this summer was a sign of how fast and steep his fall from grace might be. An ICM poll last July showed that Labour's lead among women voters aged 18-35 had plummeted from a 40-point lead over the Conservatives in early 1999 to 21 points.</p> <p>If Blair and the party's power- brokers want to stop the gender gap from opening up again, they must signal - strongly - their confidence in women MPs and ministers as a voice for women. And they must welcome a dialogue with them about gender and equal opportunity. Labour entered government in a fearful and embattled frame of mind: the new leaders in Downing Street had been wholly preoccupied by the need to outflank the Tories in marginal constituencies and appease the right-wing press. They had no appetite for difference or debate and, wherever possible, tried to suppress dissent. This was bad news for the women in parliament, who were certainly different and a threat to the status quo.</p> <p>The Guardian's political correspondent Lucy Ward tracked the journey of \"Blair's babes\" from triumph to ignominy. First, expectations and plaudits were heaped upon them. Within weeks, they were accused of failing to match up to those early, inflated hopes and routinely ridiculed in the media. In response, they sought safety in party loyalty and resisted any common identification with women. Far from defending or supporting the women MPs, \"Blair's boys\" added their voices - more or less overtly - to the chorus of disdain. They made use of strict party discipline to control any remaining assertiveness. No MP or adviser could take the side of the women against the leadership without kissing goodbye to her political career. As a result of all this, the women failed to combine forces to resist the first thing the government did that was seen as an attack - the cut in lone parent benefit. Any capacity they may have had to change the culture of politics and champion women's issues, was effectively undermined.</p> <p>Yet wasn't New Labour shooting itself in the foot? As Anne Phillips, director of the Gender Institute at the London School of Economics, points out, if a political party selects female candidates by special measures to increase the numbers of women in parliament, it must surely believe they can more effectively represent women's interests. It makes no sense to insist that, once the women are elected, party discipline trumps gender solidarity every time there is a difference of opinion.</p> <p>What the men do not realise, apparently, is how much they depend on women leaders and activists inside the party to drive forward the women's agenda, to transform the party's image and practice, and so to consolidate its appeal to female voters. Experience suggests that men show little aptitude for the task and are unlikely to give it the priority it deserves. But this is not a job for yes-women. It takes strong, free-thinking characters with enough courage to buck the trend and speak their minds. Just the sort who tend to have feminist leanings. And just the sort least welcomed by men who are transfixed by middle England and the Daily Mail.</p> <p>Only in Scotland and Wales have the new democratic institutions given women room to breathe. Wendy Alexander, the high-flying Minister for Communities in the new Scottish parliament where women have 37% of seats, describes how women have driven forward a new approach to governance and a new ordering of political priorities.</p> <p>In Wales, where women won 40% of assembly seats, assembly member Val Fedl comments that the presence of so many women is also changing the behaviour of men. \"It gives legitimacy to those men that do want to work in a way that allows for co-operation and collaboration, and places less emphasis on status and more on outcomes.\"</p> <p>In both these instances, Labour had driven up the numbers of women by selecting one male and one female candidate in \"twinned\" constituencies. Westminster now looks rather laggardly, with women in only 18% of seats. And the prospects are poor. New Labour has ditched its strategy of all-women shortlists, which helped swell the numbers at Westminster in 1997. Since then a large majority of constituencies with seats to fill have chosen men. What's more, the numbers of women on local councils - an important training ground - remains pitifully low. Fawcett Society director Mary-Ann Stephenson reports that only one in four councillors is female, and that many are put off by the poor quality of local representation, which is largely due to the fact that very few people - male or female - want to stand for election.</p> <p>As many of the contributors observe, the main point of getting more women elected, locally or nationally, is in order to make a better job of meeting women's needs and improving their lives. New Labour has already made some progress, especially in helping women into paid employment. Several authors argue that it must now - urgently - do more to tackle the problems of combining work and family. Paid parental leave for men and women would be a good start. The point is not just to help women do the \"juggling\" but, first, to acknowledge that caring is a vital contribution to the economy and, second, to extend genuine choices to men and women about how they use their time.</p> <p>Patricia Hewitt, minister of state at the Department of Trade and Industry, observes that \"in the new economy, social and economic policy are no longer separate\"; any government that wants \"to succeed in the knowledge economy must open up opportunities to women and men, challenge the segregation of roles in both the workplace and the home.\" Harriet Harman, former secretary of state for social security and Minister for Women, points out that seven departments of state have an involvement in work and family issues: \"There is no clear departmental lead, and for none of them is work and family at the top of the agenda.\" Bolton MP Ruth Kelly argues that: \"If choice is to be a reality, and women's caring role to be properly valued by society, the caring role needs to be explicitly recognised and policy geared to that end.\"</p> <p>In the final essay, Ian Christie and Michael Jacobs of the Fabian Society suggest that new political territory is being carved out: \"A new politics of quality of life gives fresh energy to an old idea associated with environmentalism and feminism - that the 'personal is political' - and opens up new issues where these movements can form alliances.\" It recognises the importance of collective action to defend and promote our individual and shared interests, and gives new prominence to gender and diversity, time use and sustainable development.</p> <p>The New Labour leadership is cer tainly aware that the political ground is shifting and wants to lead the process of change. The \"Third Way\" discourse is Blair's attempt to identify a distinctive approach and agenda. So far it has been crafted almost exclusively by white males and reflects their priorities - missing the chance to learn from a wider range of experience and to catch the tides of change. New Labour's elite must understand that the ideas and perspectives that women can bring to the party are not just a set of demands to be mollified by the occasional gesture, but are a key to the continuing process of political renewal.</p> <p>\u0095 New Gender Agenda, edited by Anna Coote, is published today by the Institute for Public Policy Research, the Fawcett Society and the Fabian Society, price \u00a310.95.

      "body": "<p>A US astronaut and a Russian cosmonaut drifted out of space shuttle Atlantis Monday, making a successful climb up the international space station that was more spacehike than spacewalk. </p> <p>Edward Lu and Yuri Malenchenko made the gruelling ascent to lay cable and install a boom for a navigation unit on the exterior of the 140-foot station during their 6 hour, 14 minute spacewalk. They carried the bundled cables on their backs, along with the boom and their tools. </p> <p>The spacewalkers ventured an astounding 110 feet from Atlantis' cargo bay, where the space station had been anchored for the past day. It was the farthest distance any Nasa spacewalker had ventured while tethered. </p> <p>\"Got a great view back at the nose of the shuttle,\" said Lu, who was on his first spacewalk. His partner performed spacewalks while living aboard Russia's Mir space station. </p> <p>The spacewalk official inside Mission Control, Mike Hess, likened the foray to working on the 11th story of a 13-story building - with a much better view, 230 miles (370 kilometres) above Earth. </p> <p>The work went flawlessly, ending 16 minutes ahead of schedule even with the addition of a brief task, the manual extension of a docking target that didn't deploy properly and was in the astronauts' way. Ordinarily, Nasa has fast-working spacewalkers tackle chores scheduled for later missions; but Lu and Malenchenko did not have to perform any get-ahead tasks. </p> <p>\"There wasn't really anything else to do on the space station and won't be, really, until the next crew gets up there,\" Hess said. </p> <p>To get to the top of the towering station, Lu and Malenchenko first took a 40-foot ride on the shuttle robot arm. Then they ascended hand over hand like rock climbers, clipping and unclipping their tethers like climbing ropes as they moved up. </p> <p>It was deliberate travel, slowed by a multitude of obstructions like antennas and docking targets. Astronaut Daniel Burbank, watching from inside the cockpit, guided Lu and Malenchenko up the stack. </p> <p>\"Watch your head,\" Burbank ordered. \"Don't move right. Bring your legs straight up... Watch your right foot. Put your feet up.\" </p> <p>The two men needed to scale the Russian service module Zvezda to erect a 6-foot boom for a compass and to install nine power, data and television cables between it and the other Russian module, Zarya. </p> <p>Russia installed the compass, which measures Earth's magnetic field, too close to Zvezda's metal hull, knocking the instrument's readings off. Nasa had asked from the start that the compass, called a magnetometer, be equipped with an extendable boom, but the Russian space program declined because of a lack of money, Hess said. </p> <p>Nasa discovered another small problem on Zvezda on Monday: a jammed solar panel on one of its wings. The panel did not unfold following launch of the module, and Nasa may have to fix the problem on a later visit. </p> <p>Atlantis linked up with the station as the spacecraft soared above Kazakhstan on Sunday, ending a two-day chase complicated slightly by a failed navigation device aboard the shuttle. Atlantis was going to take advantage of the linkup and give the station an orbital boost of about 3 miles (5 kilometers) Monday. </p> <p>The seven astronauts and cosmonauts will enter the complex Tuesday to haul in thousands of pounds of supplies for the first residents, due in November. </p> <p>At the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, meanwhile, Nasa moved space shuttle Discovery to the launch pad for an October 5 lift-off on a station-assembly mission.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A US astronaut and a Russian cosmonaut drifted out of space shuttle Atlantis Monday, making a successful climb up the international space station that was more spacehike than spacewalk. Edward Lu and Yuri Malenchenko made the gruelling ascent to lay cable and install a boom for a navigation unit on the exterior of the 140-foot station during their 6 hour, 14 minute spacewalk. They carried the bundled cables on their backs, along with the boom and their tools. The spacewalkers ventured an astounding 110 feet from Atlantis' cargo bay, where the space station had been anchored for the past day. It was the farthest distance any Nasa spacewalker had ventured while tethered. \"Got a great view back at the nose of the shuttle,\" said Lu, who was on his first spacewalk. His partner performed spacewalks while living aboard Russia's Mir space station. The spacewalk official inside Mission Control, Mike Hess, likened the foray to working on the 11th story of a 13-story building - with a much better view, 230 miles (370 kilometres) above Earth. The work went flawlessly, ending 16 minutes ahead of schedule even with the addition of a brief task, the manual extension of a docking target that didn't deploy properly and was in the astronauts' way. Ordinarily, Nasa has fast-working spacewalkers tackle chores scheduled for later missions; but Lu and Malenchenko did not have to perform any get-ahead tasks. \"There wasn't really anything else to do on the space station and won't be, really, until the next crew gets up there,\" Hess said. To get to the top of the towering station, Lu and Malenchenko first took a 40-foot ride on the shuttle robot arm. Then they ascended hand over hand like rock climbers, clipping and unclipping their tethers like climbing ropes as they moved up. It was deliberate travel, slowed by a multitude of obstructions like antennas and docking targets. Astronaut Daniel Burbank, watching from inside the cockpit, guided Lu and Malenchenko up the stack. \"Watch your head,\" Burbank ordered. \"Don't move right. Bring your legs straight up... Watch your right foot. Put your feet up.\" The two men needed to scale the Russian service module Zvezda to erect a 6-foot boom for a compass and to install nine power, data and television cables between it and the other Russian module, Zarya. Russia installed the compass, which measures Earth's magnetic field, too close to Zvezda's metal hull, knocking the instrument's readings off. Nasa had asked from the start that the compass, called a magnetometer, be equipped with an extendable boom, but the Russian space program declined because of a lack of money, Hess said. Nasa discovered another small problem on Zvezda on Monday: a jammed solar panel on one of its wings. The panel did not unfold following launch of the module, and Nasa may have to fix the problem on a later visit. Atlantis linked up with the station as the spacecraft soared above Kazakhstan on Sunday, ending a two-day chase complicated slightly by a failed navigation device aboard the shuttle. Atlantis was going to take advantage of the linkup and give the station an orbital boost of about 3 miles (5 kilometers) Monday. The seven astronauts and cosmonauts will enter the complex Tuesday to haul in thousands of pounds of supplies for the first residents, due in November. At the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, meanwhile, Nasa moved space shuttle Discovery to the launch pad for an October 5 lift-off on a station-assembly mission.",

The latest evidence from John Hills (Director of the Economic and Social Research Council Centre for Analysis of Social Exclusion at LSE) and Orsolya Lelkes is to the point. ('Social security, selective universalism and patchwork redistribution' in British Social Attitudes, the 16th report, ed. R. Jowell et al, National Centre for Social Research, 1999). A recurring finding over the years has been a clear majority for additional public spending on health, education and social benefits, even if this means higher taxes. This most up-to-date finding is to the same effect.</p> <p>Four out of five people drawn from a representative sample of the population said that the gap between those with high incomes and those with low incomes is too large People also think it is the government's responsibility to narrow the gap. A majority considers that higher taxes should be imposed on the better-off so that more can be spent on the poor. Labour's avoidance of increased taxes on the better-off as a way of financing more help for the poor seems, say Hills and Lelkes, 'to go against the opinions, not just of its own supporters, but also within the top half of household income'.</p> <p><b>Century of progress</b></p> <p>Some people will not believe that such opinions are rooted in reality. But why not? Is there not a sense around of a modern social paradox? The average standard of living is much higher than it was at the beginning of the century. Working conditions are less arduous and less dangerous. Housing has been improved and, even where the fabric is mouldering away, inside the fabric are bathrooms, hot water, indoor toilets, refrigerators and washing machines; and outside there is a mobile room waiting to add to the congestion on the roads. There is an NHS available to all. The expectation of life is higher by 25 years than a century ago. You would think we would be pretty pleased with the century that has just passed.</p> <p>But we are not. The modern social paradox is that progress of this kind, resting on increases in productivity and wealth, has been accompanied towards its end by a profound sense of unease. We wonder where the wealth is leading us to. People are better off but don't necessarily feel it. No doubt aware of the seeming paradox, economists have begun to enquire into a rather new subject for them, not the quantity of goods and service but the quality of life, or in other words, the life satisfaction or happiness with their lot. The Economic Journal had a symposium on economics and happiness, and earlier this year there was an international conference in Oxford on the same subject. Many comparative surveys, which have turned out to be properly comparable despite the subjectivity of the judgements, have been made in 48 countries. There is, however strange it may seem, a World Data Base of Happiness. (R. Veenhoven, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, in a paper prepared for the Oxford conference.)</p> <p>I mention this because one of the consistent findings of all this is that, although at any one point of time people with higher incomes are more satisfied with life than those with lower incomes, over a period of time corresponding to a life cycle, while incomes have risen, people's satisfaction has not increased.(R.A. Easterlin, University of Southern California, paper on 'Income and Happiness: Towards a Unified Theory', for the same Oxford conference).</p> <p>Aspirations about what people should have rise along with their actual incomes. If this is the general experience it would go some way towards explaining why at the end of the century (as at other times) riches are not thought of as adding to wellbeing beyond a certain point. Evidently we are all on a hedonistic treadmill making an effort to increase our happiness by acquiring more goods and services with a goal which ever recedes as we advance towards it. Looking back on what has happened, we seem to have been engaged on a self-defeating, even futile task. It seems as though the New England philosopher, Emerson, had it right when he said 'Want is a growing giant whom the coat of Have was never large enough to cover'.</p> <p>Ethics do not come into such calculations which come from how people report their feelings about themselves. Ethics are about other people and how well or ill you behave towards them and they to you and each other. Your unease can be added to if you think of other people, especially towards the bottom of the heap and overseas as well - in Britain they have obviously not done well for themselves in the mean streets of the inner cities where they have to live, littered with thrown-away Coca Cola cans and chicken bones. According to Lord Rogers' Government Urban Task Force British cities have the sharpest social divisions in western Europe. The homes of young people may be in what are no-go areas for the better-off. Crime is growing and the fear of crime is growing faster.</p> <p>So neglect at the bottom is combined with indulgence at the top - but with the suggestion that the indulgent may also be discontented, or at best no better off in the way they feel about themselves. At a deep level something has gone awry, no doubt for many reasons. Perhaps one is that more wealthy people in wealthy countries like ours are beginning to question whether wealth has so much value apart from monetary. Perhaps some satiation is setting in, perhaps enough will be enough. If it happens there could be less resistance to higher taxes and a surplus left over for the poor at home and even more, for the poor overseas who are still in grim and absolute poverty. In the century ahead we may get near the point where advanced society turns in a new direction. If it happened it would be the biggest watershed since the first Industrial Revolution: people would no longer be cursed by being unequal but prized for their differences from one another.</p> <p>Were we to evaluate people, not only according to their intelligence and their education, their occupations and their power, but according to their kindliness and their courage, their imagination and sensitivity, their sympathy and generosity, there would be no overall inequalities of the sort we have got used to. Who would be able to say that the scientist was superior to the porter with admirable qualities as a father, the civil servant with unusual skills at gaining prizes superior to the lorry-driver with unusual skills at growing roses? A pluralistic society would also be the tolerant society, in which individual differences were actively encouraged as well as passively tolerated, in which full meaning was at last given to the dignity of man. Every human being would then have equal opportunity, not to rise up in the world in the light of any mathematical measure pervading the whole society but to develop his or her own special capacities for leading a full life which is also a noble life led for the benefit of others as well as the self.</p> <p>The question with which I opened was whether the principles of the Attlee government are still of any relevance. I have been arguing that they are. The conclusions? - restore the pride of people in the public services and tax the rich. In other words, the ghost of Let Us Face The Future is not yet laid to rest.</p>",

The average standard of living is much higher than it was at the beginning of the century. Working conditions are less arduous and less dangerous. Housing has been improved and, even where the fabric is mouldering away, inside the fabric are bathrooms, hot water, indoor toilets, refrigerators and washing machines; and outside there is a mobile room waiting to add to the congestion on the roads. There is an NHS available to all. The expectation of life is higher by 25 years than a century ago. You would think we would be pretty pleased with the century that has just passed. But we are not. The modern social paradox is that progress of this kind, resting on increases in productivity and wealth, has been accompanied towards its end by a profound sense of unease. We wonder where the wealth is leading us to. People are better off but don't necessarily feel it. No doubt aware of the seeming paradox, economists have begun to enquire into a rather new subject for them, not the quantity of goods and service but the quality of life, or in other words, the life satisfaction or happiness with their lot. The Economic Journal had a symposium on economics and happiness, and earlier this year there was an international conference in Oxford on the same subject. Many comparative surveys, which have turned out to be properly comparable despite the subjectivity of the judgements, have been made in 48 countries. There is, however strange it may seem, a World Data Base of Happiness. (R. Veenhoven, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, in a paper prepared for the Oxford conference.) I mention this because one of the consistent findings of all this is that, although at any one point of time people with higher incomes are more satisfied with life than those with lower incomes, over a period of time corresponding to a life cycle, while incomes have risen, people's satisfaction has not increased.(R.A. Easterlin, University of Southern California, paper on 'Income and Happiness: Towards a Unified Theory', for the same Oxford conference). Aspirations about what people should have rise along with their actual incomes. If this is the general experience it would go some way towards explaining why at the end of the century (as at other times) riches are not thought of as adding to wellbeing beyond a certain point. Evidently we are all on a hedonistic treadmill making an effort to increase our happiness by acquiring more goods and services with a goal which ever recedes as we advance towards it. Looking back on what has happened, we seem to have been engaged on a self-defeating, even futile task. It seems as though the New England philosopher, Emerson, had it right when he said 'Want is a growing giant whom the coat of Have was never large enough to cover'. Ethics do not come into such calculations which come from how people report their feelings about themselves. Ethics are about other people and how well or ill you behave towards them and they to you and each other. Your unease can be added to if you think of other people, especially towards the bottom of the heap and overseas as well - in Britain they have obviously not done well for themselves in the mean streets of the inner cities where they have to live, littered with thrown-away Coca Cola cans and chicken bones. According to Lord Rogers' Government Urban Task Force British cities have the sharpest social divisions in western Europe. The homes of young people may be in what are no-go areas for the better-off. Crime is growing and the fear of crime is growing faster. So neglect at the bottom is combined with indulgence at the top - but with the suggestion that the indulgent may also be discontented, or at best no better off in the way they feel about themselves. At a deep level something has gone awry, no doubt for many reasons. Perhaps one is that more wealthy people in wealthy countries like ours are beginning to question whether wealth has so much value apart from monetary. Perhaps some satiation is setting in, perhaps enough will be enough. If it happens there could be less resistance to higher taxes and a surplus left over for the poor at home and even more, for the poor overseas who are still in grim and absolute poverty. In the century ahead we may get near the point where advanced society turns in a new direction. If it happened it would be the biggest watershed since the first Industrial Revolution: people would no longer be cursed by being unequal but prized for their differences from one another. Were we to evaluate people, not only according to their intelligence and their education, their occupations and their power, but according to their kindliness and their courage, their imagination and sensitivity, their sympathy and generosity, there would be no overall inequalities of the sort we have got used to. Who would be able to say that the scientist was superior to the porter with admirable qualities as a father, the civil servant with unusual skills at gaining prizes superior to the lorry-driver with unusual skills at growing roses? A pluralistic society would also be the tolerant society, in which individual differences were actively encouraged as well as passively tolerated, in which full meaning was at last given to the dignity of man. Every human being would then have equal opportunity, not to rise up in the world in the light of any mathematical measure pervading the whole society but to develop his or her own special capacities for leading a full life which is also a noble life led for the benefit of others as well as the self. The question with which I opened was whether the principles of the Attlee government are still of any relevance. I have been arguing that they are. The conclusions? - restore the pride of people in the public services and tax the rich. In other words, the ghost of Let Us Face The Future is not yet laid to rest.",

I have changed my mind about the subject of my talk and I am going to take a broad topic of equality and public service which belong to sociology and also to economics and to political science, so I am going to have to cross boundaries. I could not resist in a small way on this millennial occasion having a look back at some features of the post-war period back to its beginning. This even though I know it is one of the dangerous temptations of old age to mull over the past.</p> <p>55 years ago it was easy for me, beginning to launch myself into the sociology of politics in my backroom role as Secretary of Labour's Policy Committee and Head of the Research Department (there were still job titles in the classless society inherited from the war) to draft Let Us Face the Future, the manifesto for the 1945 General Election. It was already all there in Mr Attlee's head, in the head of Mr Morrison as Chairman of the Policy Committee, and in my younger one. All I had to do was to tune in to the spirit of the times as well as add Beveridge and Keynes to Keir Hardie. Attlee is distant history and it would not be worth recalling were there no lessons to be learned for the present. After all this time - 55 years is a long time in politics - is anything at all from it still relevant?</p> <p><b>The two principles</b></p> <p>No on the detail. But on two of its principles, perhaps yes. The first principle was equity in the distribution of incomes; the second was the importance of public service. I shall try to deal with each of them in turn.</p> <p><b>Golden Age</b></p> <p>1945 was followed by what has been called the Golden Age, an age of the mixed economy, an admittedly sometimes faltering economy subject to stop-go but in which there was full employment without inflation. There was also secular growth in the economy. And - the specifically socialist contribution to the mix - as Tony Crosland famously said, socialism is about equality - there was a relatively equal society. It was a confident society with belief in the future in which there was a baby boom - no fear then of a population decline - and to start with it was led from the front by a government which made the most of its advantages. Generally, they widened the span of concern for the wellbeing of others and tried to make society more inclusive of the poor and the distressed, the disabled and the sick, the children and the elderly who cannot support themselves.</p> <p><b>Inequality worsened</b></p> <p>Since then in more recent years growing inequality has befallen the country and some other countries too. Some of the main facts have been brought together by Professor Atkinson in his WIDER lecture for the United Nations University (AB Atkinson, 'Is Rising Equality Inevitable? A Critique of the Transatlantic Consensus', November 1999), both about the tendencies in a market economy for the poor to get poorer and the rich richer. The shift has coincided, not coincidentally, with moves to the Right in politics and a masochistic rush on the part of governments to prostrate themselves before market forces.</p> <p>There is not much dispute about inequality having got more severe. The dispute centres on what can be done about it, or even (with the well-groomed men who have done so well for themselves always ready to say no, it can't) whether anything can be done about it. The question is whether we can show that growing inequality, though it stems from a world that is chasing greed with abandoned relish, is neither inevitable nor desirable.</p> <p>There are multiple causes of the inequality, interacting in multiple ways. In Atkinson's interpretation, which has the United States and the United Kingdom at its core, the inequality is put down to two main causes, changes in technology and changes in the pattern of international trade and in Britain these were helped to achieve their effects by a series of political decisions during the Thatcher regime.</p> <p><b>Technology</b></p> <p>Technological change is apt to increase unemployment in the short run whenever it raises productivity and enables goods and services to be produced more efficiently with less labour. The advances in automation and, especially in information technology, have been at the expense of unskilled workers with little education. The more unemployment, the more the downward pressure on wages from people desperate for work. Workers no longer have as much protection from undercutting as they used to have from trade unions or from industrial accidents for that matter. In the British case, Mrs Thatcher attacked the unions by legislation and on the streets. After a quasi-military mobilisation of force in the miners' strike the National Union of Mineworkers was destroyed and the bargaining power of that union, and of unions generally, was weakened, and the pressure on wages reinforced.</p> <p>The poor, including pensioners, were also attacked by indexing benefits to prices instead of wages. Since prices have not generally risen as much as wages, the poor who are not working have been the ones who have been made to suffer. This deprivation for the poor has persisted right up to the present, well into the term of office of the new Labour Government. A small step has been taken in the right direction with the Minimum Income Guarantee for low-income pensioners which is to be earnings-linked but since it is means-tested the take-up will be only partial. In any case the old principle needs to be restored generally, not just for a particular benefit like that.</p> <p><b>Patterns of trade</b></p> <p>The same core countries (more or less the G7) dominate world commerce as much as they did a century ago. But international trade has been more under the control of multinational corporations and the new trading blocs while it has also been generally liberalised, at least up till the threatened collapse of the World Trade Organisation at Seattle. Within the more global economy, the competition from newly industrialised countries has cut most sharply at the bargaining power of unskilled workers. Theirs are the jobs lost to the cheaper labour abroad and theirs the wages put under threat as the products of labour-intensive industries have been outsourced to India or Taiwan, Indonesia or China or wherever. Inequality between wage-earners in poorer countries and richer may have diminished a little as a result. That is hardly consolation to people on low wages or no wages at all in Britain. If changes in technology and world trade have accentuated inequality, where does that leave us in Britain? Are we caught up in a global economy which we have no choice about being in and cannot escape from even if we wanted to?</p> <p><b>From the bottom up</b></p> <p>The government is certainly not powerless. It can cushion the effect of the competition, even if it cannot damp it right down and does not want to anyway. Better training needs to be provided for youngsters and others who cannot get into jobs at all, lacking the skills which employers require. This the government has done something about.</p> <p>The government can also support the wages of the low paid which it has done with the Working Families Tax Credit. Their take-home pay is larger than it would otherwise be. This has the effect of easing the poverty trap. The Tax Credit reduces the extent to which some people are better-off on benefit than they are if they take jobs at low wages. The government can also enforce a Minimum Wage, as Labour is doing and Conservatives refused to do.</p> <p>Even if inequality increases when low wages are under such pressure from technology and overseas competition, the welfare system is the more important influence on the lot of the poor. In the Golden Age transfer from the better-off to the less well-off and the taxation which funded the transfers by and large had the intended redistributive effect. But from 1984 onwards, quite apart from globalisation, a major shift in policy aggravated inequality. Direct taxation of income is 'progressive': those with higher incomes pay more in tax. Indirect taxation on goods and services in the form of VAT and other taxes is regressive. For the less well-off the indirect taxes represent a larger proportion of their lower incomes.</p> <p>From 1984 on inequality was promoted quite deliberately by a move from progressive income taxes to regressive indirect taxes and by cutting back on benefits through the new indexation and in other ways. The tools were there and they could be used to ill effect. They can also be used to good effect, not to foster inequality but to reduce it by raising income taxes and reducing indirect taxes.</p> <p>In its first two years in office the new government stuck to Conservative spending limits and carried through the cut in the single parent benefit inherited from the Conservatives. Under Labour all-round poverty actually increased. Since then the move has been in the right direction (small 'r'), to help children, for example, who have the best case of all. 'When poverty strikes a family, the youngest members become its most innocent and vulnerable victims. Since a good start in life - especially in the first few months - is critical to the physical, intellectual and emotional development of every individual, poverty in early childhood can prove to be a handicap for life.' (UNICEF (United Nations Children's Fund), 'Poverty Reduction Begins with Children', March 2000).</p> <p>Labour now looks like bringing 1.4 million children out of poverty by 2002. The goal is to end child poverty in 20 years. That is fine. But it does seem a very long time to wait. Expected progress is too slow. When (or if) the first 2002 target is reached, child poverty will still be nearly twice as high as when a Labour government was last in office in 1979. There is a long way to go before what was lost is recouped. Child poverty rose from 1.4 million in 1968 to 4.4 million in 1997. Another UNICEF Report on the 23 richest nations in the world showed that in the child poverty league the UK was the fourth worst in the industrialised world.</p> <p>It is the same story with the New Deal training programme. If low levels of skill are partly responsible for unemployment, low wages and the consequent inequality, it makes the best of sense to put a large effort into training and even more into schooling at younger ages when basic attitudes to learning are established. The New Deal needs to be much enlarged, especially for older people.</p> <p><b>Middle-age trap</b></p> <p>An incredible 2,600,000 people over 50 but under retirement age have not been in Work (The Annual Abstract of Statistics, 1999, Table 7.16). Many of them are also caught in a painful middle-age trap. Employers without compassion for their employees, but a lot for their own money, often cannot resist sacking older employees when they are cutting back on the size of their workforces. If occupational pensions are linked to salaries employers can save money by sacking senior employees. The excuse, implicit if not explicit, is that people are 'too old at 50', if not at 40. It is even worse for people who have no such pension. Their state pension is a long way off and when it comes it is liable to be reduced anyway because full National Insurance Contributions have not been paid.</p> <p>Labour promised legislation against age discrimination which could have come down heavily on employers who discriminate in this way; but there has been no hint of it so far, not in the present parliament anyway. The introduction of the New Deal 50-Plus has been a start, at least in giving a little support for people of this age who can get work. But it is on much too small a scale; the middle-age trap is still there, often leaving people in dire poverty when their unemployment benefit and redundancy benefits are exhausted, and with no relief in sight.</p> <p>The conclusion so far is that the global economy has not (as the EU has not) removed the ability of governments to aid the poorest and the poor. It can do so without resorting to trade protectionism. It would be no solution to block cheap imports; it would invite other countries to block British exports and those of our industrialised trading partners in Europe and elsewhere. But the social effects, both of changes in technology at home and changes in the nature of competition from abroad, can, and need to be, countered by lifting up the benefits for the poor and doing everything possible to raise skill levels.</p> <p><b>Top down</b></p> <p>So something has been done, and more promised, to raise the bottom. But very little at the top end where rising relative wages have been the main source of growing inequality. The richer have not been called on to make sacrifices themselves. To judge from what ministers say, poverty is not a taboo word but equality is, and redistribution nearly so. Ministers have concentrated on those who have little in the way of income and not much of anything in the way of wealth, and almost entirely failed to tackle those with plenty of both. Inequality has therefore been added to even more by ballooning out at the top than by squeezing in at the bottom.</p> <p>The display of self interest in a naked form has not exactly added to social cohesion or provided a good example when appeals are made for wage restraint. The people at the bottom may be getting a few pounds more for themselves and their children but what is going on at the top can only add to their sense of injustice. In elections the poor have one vote each, just like any rich person; in the economy each rich person counts for much more.</p> <p>We seem to be into a new golden age, not for equality but for booty. The latest lot of figures has been collected in a survey for the Guardian. The pay of Britain*s top businessmen went up by 16.5% in 1999, four times the average wage Increase. The increase was often from an already elevated base. More than 110 senior executives (including one woman) received more than \u00a31m pa in basic income without counting in share options with their tax advantages. Some basic income!</p> <p>We in Britain have not yet got to the point where in recent years the wealthy have fattened themselves up (literally - obesity is a national problem in USA) as much as across the Atlantic. But the UK is on the way. Top salaries and benefits are much higher than they were for top people of many different sorts with others at many different lower levels taking their lead from the top. In these circumstances the government clearly needs to act to moderate a further cranking up of inequality.</p> <p><b>Supertax</b></p> <p>It was a good start when it came to power with a pledge to tax the windfall profits of utilities. This turned out to be a one-off when it need not have been. There have been many other windfall profits - by banks, for instance - and even more windfall gains to people like those senior executives. If the government took action it could be following precedent. The Liberal government of 1905 not only benefited the poor with the Pensions Act of 1908 and the National Insurance Act of 1911 but was spirited enough to call on wealthier people to make their contribution to the cost of rearmament and also of the reform by introducing the first Supertax in Lloyd George's 'People's Budget' of 1909.</p> <p>So far the stance of government towards business more generally could hardly have been more favourable than it has been, yielding on this score very little or anything to Thatcher or Major. The values of private enterprise and businessmen have become the darlings of government instead of trade unionism and the union leaders who were once served by Harold Wilson with beer and sandwiches at No.10. The government has behaved as though it is a government of business. The favour for private enterprise has been the counterpart of the disfavour for public ownership and the public services.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,367279,00.html\">Part two: the old notion of public service</a></p>",

The introduction of the New Deal 50-Plus has been a start, at least in giving a little support for people of this age who can get work. But it is on much too small a scale; the middle-age trap is still there, often leaving people in dire poverty when their unemployment benefit and redundancy benefits are exhausted, and with no relief in sight. The conclusion so far is that the global economy has not (as the EU has not) removed the ability of governments to aid the poorest and the poor. It can do so without resorting to trade protectionism. It would be no solution to block cheap imports; it would invite other countries to block British exports and those of our industrialised trading partners in Europe and elsewhere. But the social effects, both of changes in technology at home and changes in the nature of competition from abroad, can, and need to be, countered by lifting up the benefits for the poor and doing everything possible to raise skill levels. Top down So something has been done, and more promised, to raise the bottom. But very little at the top end where rising relative wages have been the main source of growing inequality. The richer have not been called on to make sacrifices themselves. To judge from what ministers say, poverty is not a taboo word but equality is, and redistribution nearly so. Ministers have concentrated on those who have little in the way of income and not much of anything in the way of wealth, and almost entirely failed to tackle those with plenty of both. Inequality has therefore been added to even more by ballooning out at the top than by squeezing in at the bottom. The display of self interest in a naked form has not exactly added to social cohesion or provided a good example when appeals are made for wage restraint. The people at the bottom may be getting a few pounds more for themselves and their children but what is going on at the top can only add to their sense of injustice. In elections the poor have one vote each, just like any rich person; in the economy each rich person counts for much more. We seem to be into a new golden age, not for equality but for booty. The latest lot of figures has been collected in a survey for the Guardian. The pay of Britain*s top businessmen went up by 16.5% in 1999, four times the average wage Increase. The increase was often from an already elevated base. More than 110 senior executives (including one woman) received more than \u00a31m pa in basic income without counting in share options with their tax advantages. Some basic income! We in Britain have not yet got to the point where in recent years the wealthy have fattened themselves up (literally - obesity is a national problem in USA) as much as across the Atlantic. But the UK is on the way. Top salaries and benefits are much higher than they were for top people of many different sorts with others at many different lower levels taking their lead from the top. In these circumstances the government clearly needs to act to moderate a further cranking up of inequality. Supertax It was a good start when it came to power with a pledge to tax the windfall profits of utilities. This turned out to be a one-off when it need not have been. There have been many other windfall profits - by banks, for instance - and even more windfall gains to people like those senior executives. If the government took action it could be following precedent. The Liberal government of 1905 not only benefited the poor with the Pensions Act of 1908 and the National Insurance Act of 1911 but was spirited enough to call on wealthier people to make their contribution to the cost of rearmament and also of the reform by introducing the first Supertax in Lloyd George's 'People's Budget' of 1909. So far the stance of government towards business more generally could hardly have been more favourable than it has been, yielding on this score very little or anything to Thatcher or Major. The values of private enterprise and businessmen have become the darlings of government instead of trade unionism and the union leaders who were once served by Harold Wilson with beer and sandwiches at No.10. The government has behaved as though it is a government of business. The favour for private enterprise has been the counterpart of the disfavour for public ownership and the public services.

      "body": "<p>I now come to the second principle underlying Let Us Face The Future. The old notion of public service was still very much in evidence at the time of the Attlee government. The ideal was that in the good society every citizen contributes to the wellbeing of the city not because they want some special gains out of it for themselves as individuals but because they love the city.</p> <p>The ideal was of public service in voluntary work and, above all, in the public services like local government or essential services such as health or education, water or electricity, gas, coal or railways; not totally altruistic, being paid for it certainly, but without monetary gain as a main motive. The firmness of principle was most evident in the civil and military services and in the professions also upholding an ethic of conduct which was in different degrees shared by people working in the publicly owned industries.</p> <p>Bad public service or not, the popular view has it that as an offset to all its positive achievements the Attlee government failed in one important respect - in its attempt to run some industries as public services. Public ownership in one of its manifestations - in the health industry - was and is an exception to the general view; but then the policy was much less doctrinaire than in the other nationalised industries, with considerable scope left in the NHS for private enterprise within it.</p> <p>Public ownership in manufacturing has been the chief butt of criticism. But in my view (no doubt biased) the failure was not in the notion of public ownership itself, so much as in the way it was done. It had only been done once before 1945, which was when Herbert Morrison set up as a public corporation the London Passenger Transport Board during the Labour Government of 1929-31. The model was seized on immediately after 1945, whether it was appropriate or not.</p> <p>The weakness of the public corporation was that it was so much a creature of government. 'The economic purpose of government' said the manifesto, 'must be to spur industry forward and not to choke it with red tape'. But it did not work out that way. The red tape remained and was especially abundant and harmful for the publicly owned industries. The Treasury kept tight control over their finances, hence of their policies, from the beginning and this limited their autonomy.</p> <p>If Labour had won the 1950 election with a convincing majority it might have gradually freed itself from the straitjacket of the old public corporation and favoured a variety of different kinds of common and co-operative ownership like enterprises owned by their employees (like the John Lewis Partnership or like mutual building societies owned by their members and mutual insurers owned by their policy holders, all subject to market forces but without throwing away the whole notion of an alternative to ordinary private enterprise.</p> <p>The mutuals remaining up to now - in insurance and building societies - would probably have been saved from recent carpetbaggers and the ever-present temptations of greed. The Halifax, the Woolwich and Abbey National would not have turned their back on their Victorian origins and become commercial banks. As it is, by a strange turnaround the Nationwide amongst building societies and Standard Life amongst life insurers are, with some others, fighting for the cause of common ownership which Labour once espoused; as it has worked out, they have not had any noticeable backing in their fight from the government.</p> <p><b>The elevation of profit-seeking</b></p> <p>Public enterprise being beyond the pale, private enterprise has become the icon. The premium it places on competition, on profit-motivated judgements, and on acquisitiveness, has been given a seal of approval. Private enterprise is regarded as all-round superior to public services with their own more altruistic ethic. It follows that privatisation has to be pursued for all the world as if there has been no change of government. In a way it now requires more determination even than Mrs. Thatcher had to cut back the public services further because so much was taken away from them previously and it is not obvious who the next victims should be out of what little is left.</p> <p>It is strange to see such enthusiasm for the privatisation of Air Traffic Control and the partial privatisation of London Underground when it has become rather generally admitted that the same Department made such a botched job of rail privatisation. The public services have been regarded as having a special advantage when safety has to be a first priority; it is difficult to be so sure about safety when profit is also paramount. Then, according to present practice, so much call has to be made on private finance for the building of hospitals, the take-over of quarters for servicemen and offices for government departments. The taxpayer has anyway to bear the cost of such developments in the longer term. Why is it better to incur long-term obligations of that sort than for the public body itself to raise the money?</p> <p>The superiority of private enterprise is now dinned into the public service by the practice of calling upon it to save the day when the public authorities are said to have 'failed'. It can happen when individual schools have failed or a whole local education authority, as Leeds lost control of its school services after an OFSTED inspection report which the Chief Inspector said was serious and shocking. The government has recommended intervention in 15 local education authorities which have been inspected. Privatisation can happen when a prison is in trouble even if the private company has no experience in running prisons or no experience in the transport of prisoners to and from the courts. The private company, being private, is (they imply) bound to be better at providing a public service. I am sorry for Herbert Morrison in his grave, and only hope he is communicating with his grandson.</p> <p>I suppose it is in keeping with its predilection for private enterprise when the government turns on its own people - the people it employs in the public service - and attacks them. Against teachers the denigration has been part of a long-lasting campaign, and a bitter one. The Conservatives started it. It is not just the public remarks. The two-pronged attack has been built into the institution of schools (a) through the ubiquitous system, devised in detail by the central government and its attendant quangos, for testing children on their attainments at frequent intervals during their school days as well as (b) by the inspections by OFSTED, behind them looming the figure of Chris Woodhead, HM Chief Inspector of Schools, the hammer of the teachers. It matters so much because many schools, particularly in inner cities, have become the reinforcers of inequality. In the name of equality of opportunity they have consigned all those who cannot take advantage of the opportunity, and as it has turned out this is mostly boys and those who come from troubled family backgrounds, to a position of early inferiority which tends to perpetuate itself throughout life. The brand of inferiority can be burnt into children even at nursery school if they do not do as well as some other children and the teachers or the situation make this clear then.</p> <p>The regular testing of children is at the same time the regular testing of their teachers, and one that marks the teachers too if the results are poor and their school stands out for its lowly position in the published league tables. Where that happens an OFSTED inspection becomes more than ever dreaded. Bad marks again and in extreme cases a school can be closed down or a company or other new team brought in to make an attempt to put things right.</p> <p>If teachers are frightened and their reputation undermined, the quality of their teaching is bound to suffer. The work of teachers is extremely demanding when so many of their pupils are disturbed by the stresses in their own families and when even those who are not disturbed have become less biddable. Teachers need to be valued. To perform they need to feel good; and many of them feel far from that. One result of the official criticism of teachers is that more and more parents who can afford it take their children off to private schools, and more and more teachers are considering turning against the Party which has turned against them by making them into separators on a grand scale of the sheep from the goats.</p> <p><b>Local government</b></p> <p>But perhaps nothing is more extraordinary in this saga of a government turning on its own than its part in destroying local government. The government professes to believe in devolution and it has taken its own protestations seriously and bravely in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. But why not for Geordies or Scousers, Glaswegians, Brummies, or the Cornish, or the people of Durham or Sheffield or the South Hams? They are gradually being disenfranchised. Councillors, amongst them many who are the backbone of Labour in their localities, have been pushed aside, and their staff scorned - though between them they are the agents of government for the performance of hundreds of duties and the spokesmen to central government about the peculiarities and the needs of their local electorate. We hear no more of subsidiarity - the happy doctrine that the work of government should be done at the most local level possible unless there is good reason to the contrary.</p> <p>The undermining of local government has certainly not been in the interests of the poor, except where, as sometimes happens, they have been involved in the local implementation and there actually has been decent local planning. Mobilise local people, including the poor, and give them their head, and something really valuable might come of it. Poorer people have a special interest, if only they can make it effective. For :<br> 'Poorer people almost always experience worse environments than richer ones. Air pollution and traffic congestion are worse in inner city areas than leafy suburbs; there's less green space and more litter. Rich people can buy sufficient energy to give their cars air conditioning; poor people cannot afford to heat their homes properly. As the Government's Acheson report into inequalities in health showed, not only are respiratory diseases more prevalent among people in low-income groups, but so are traffic accidents. Friends of the Earth recently showed that the most polluting factories in Britain were all located close to low income residential areas.' (D McLaren et al, Pollution Injustice, Friends of the Earth, 1999. Quoted in an excellent Fabian pamphlet - M. Jacobs, Environmental Modernisation - the new Labour agenda, Fabian Society, October, 1999).</p> <p>The point, about health is particularly telling. The link between ill-health and poverty (and also with lack of control over work and working conditions) has been amply demonstrated. (R.G. Wilkinson, Unhealthy Societies - The Afflictions of Inequality, Routledge, 1996. M.G. Marmot et al, 'Changing Social Class Distribution of Heart Disease', British Medical Journal, II:1209-12, 1978).</p> <p>Public services matter most to the poorer because they are dependent on the public services to get their essential needs satisfied; they have nowhere else to go. If poorer people are dissatisfied with the school their children attend, or will have to attend in the future, they have not the money to buy a place in a private school. If they are dissatisfied with the medical care they receive they cannot go private, to a private doctor. Without money you either get from the state school or the GP and the National Health Service what you need, or you get nothing. The public services - beyond the two big ones, of education and health - include dozens of others, housing, social services, refuse disposal, sometimes buses, libraries, roads, pavements, traffic management, sporting facilities, parks, leisure and recreation, which come from local government. They provide the essentials of life to everyone but especially to poorer people who cannot afford to pay for them.</p> <p>The budget of mid-2000 came at a crucial time. More was to be spent on education and health. It will take years for the increased expenditure to work its way through to individual schools and hospitals. Public spending, especially on massively complex services, cannot be turned on like a tap. But it was a sign, and indeed a very welcome one. At least there is a show of egalitarian sentiment. The public service element in the standard of living of the poor should, in due course, rise.</p> <p>The spending will not bear fruit in full measure unless other complementary steps are taken. The attacks on teachers need to stop. They need to be valued and allowed to do their job of teaching without being harried, and without their children also being harried by tests and inspections. The only way in which best value can be obtained from each pound spent is through respecting and, indeed, honouring the people in the front line who are actually going to provide the service, face to face, hand to hand, to the children in the schools and the patients, the actual men, women and children attending the surgeries. The hoped-for improved standards of delivery will not feed through to the public if at the same time the infrastucture is being overhauled root and branch by the abolition or weakening of local education authorities or handing over the building of more and more hospitals to private companies who may be able to secure the funding if government underwrites it all but who know little or nothing in fine detail about the needs that hospitals have to satisfy. The best advice to Whitehall is to trust the people who know about the localities in which regeneration is being attempted to get on with it. (The value put on public services is one of the many virtues of a new textbook on economics - H. Stretton, Economics - New Introduction, Pluto Press, 1999).</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,367280,00.html\">Part three: Middle England again</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "The fact that Enoch Powell's 1968 attack on immigration has found a place in the collective memory of British politics says a lot about the remarkable restraint with which the issue of race is usually handled in this country. Elsewhere in Europe, race and politics are much more to the fore and Powell's allusions to \"rivers of blood\" would have been swamped by yet nastier and more recent claims. Not just in Austria either, though the xenophobia of the country's Freedom Party is so overt that other EU states have placed the country in a sort of political quarantine, pending better behaviour. This record of verbal gentility by British MPs is obviously better than the alternative, yet it brings dangers nonetheless. Just because politicians are cautious in what they say does not mean they are always tolerant in what they do. John Major refused to play the race card at the last general election, after it had been handed to him at his final question time as prime minister by the late Tory MP Nicholas Winterton. But he was hardly generous in offering refuge to victims of the conflict in the Balkans. And for all the fuss made now about the number of asylum-seekers arriving in Dover, Britain's record stands out mainly for its meanness. Germany, for all its neo-Nazi undercurrents, is kinder to those who want to move there. This disparity between words and actions is no coincidence. British politicians are so eager to keep race out of politics that they fall into the trap of behaving with an absence of liberalism in the hope of keeping the racist genie in the bottle. In short, the government might be kinder to asylum-seekers if it was not worried that middle England would turn against it at the polls. This makes today's speech by immigration minister Barbara Roche especially commendable. She has pointed out the obvious, that Britain is suffering an acute skills shortage in key areas such as IT and that, for all the training schemes available to the unemployed here, the country needs experts from abroad if the economy is to thrive. This is not revolutionary stuff - after all, nurses, doctors and teachers have long been recruited overseas. But Ms Roche is right to suggest that a more generous system, along the lines of the US green card, will be required in the future. Her words are welcome not so much for the content of what she says (the government is not about to announce any imminent changes to immigration laws) but for the fact that she is saying anything of any substance at all which does not pander to intolerance. Beyond this, the reaction to her mild proposals will say a lot in itself. Conservatives will be tempted to express their party's opposition to Ms Roche's speech in the hope of shoring up hardcore, illiberal, support, but such comments would not necessarily make the party a racist one, merely opportunist. Likewise, Labour ministers may turn their scorn on the Tories for their apparent racism, but again that does not necessarily make them liberals, just opportunists after an easy target. But race is too important an issue to kick about in this way. Over the weekend, the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, made a speech that attacked William Hague and his home affairs team for the Conservative party's recent use of immigration as a political weapon. He criticised, in particular, John Bercow, a Tory junior spokesman who was once a member of the Monday Club, a party group which called for immigrants to be repatriated. His points were fair enough, but the suspicion remains that the foreign secretary was simply mouthing platitudes. While Britain's politicians are happy to talk tolerance without practising it, race will remain the issue that is seen but never debated, and only heard of at all as a cheap way of denigrating opponents.

Ask away... <br> Iain Banks (and Iain M Banks)</p> <p><strong>blackbird21 </strong><br> Which science fiction writers do you admire? </p> <p><strong>IainMBanks</strong><br> Um, lots. (There's a list, but it's a bit long...)</p> <p> <strong>desaic</strong><br> Would you ever consider publishing an e-book? (I'm sure you're popular enough for it to be worthwhile financially.) </p> <p><strong>IainMBanks</strong><br> I don't know yet. I tend to leave all the hard stuff to my publishers. So if it was easy... maybe.</p> <p> <strong>prakp</strong><br> The Culture tries to assimilate new peoples gradually. It uses persuasion, reason, direction and the odd dirty trick rather than overt conquest - despite (or perhaps because of) any invasions or wars it may have started in the past. (I haven't read Windward yet!) <br> Is this policy a deliberate echo of the way the West no longer colonises by force but instead achieves similar ends through cultural and economic imperialism and the aggressive promotion of democracy? </p> <p><strong>IainMBanks</strong><br> Sort of, yes. Except the Culture doesn't have its own economic self-interest at heart, so it's nicer.</p> <p> <strong>adaldan</strong><br> Well, I tried to sort of ration LTW, but past page 100 there's no stopping, is there. I liked it a lot, it was funny, grandiose, sad and sulking in more or less equal parts, though I felt you cheated a little bit. ;-) <br> But I was a little puzzled by something towards the end. I will try to not spoil things for anybody but I have to ask: that is not how the Culture is supposed to act, is it? </p> <p><strong>IainMBanks</strong><br> Not exactly. But behaving wildly (and viciously) out of character means that the bad-guys can't ever exactly predict they can get away with before the Culture steps in, or how bad the retribution will be. And of course, there's lots of different tendencies within SC... Maybe it was just a nasty Mind on the duty roster that day.</p> <p> <strong>jrkennedy</strong><br> Are you fed up with writing Culture novels or do you think they will run and run? </p> <p><strong>IainMBanks</strong><br> Not fed up. I've no definite plans for the next one and it's probably a long way down the line if/when it does happen, but I find it hard to imagine I won't write about the Culture again.</p> <p> <strong>smainprize</strong><br> Your last couple of \"M-less\" books have in one way or another been set in a world that isn't *quite* the real one... are you planning to write any more novels set in real-world situations? I'm thinking of Complicity and The Crow Road, which are my favourites of all your books. </p> <p><strong>IainMBanks</strong><br> Again, no set plans, but I imagine there'll be a real-world mainstream book before too long.</p> <p> <strong>etolstoy</strong><br> Enjoy your books. Where do you get the motivation from for each story? People you know? Or random paths you would like to follow and see where they lead? </p> <p><strong>IainMBanks</strong><br> Never people I know (too dangerous - I need all the friends I can get and have no desire to get biffed on the nose because someone thought their portrait was unflattering). As an example of where the ideas originate, the genesis of Look To Windward came from thinking about the pattern of the earlier books, where somebody from the Culture goes to another civilisation (and has lots of exciting adventures, and... reversing the polarity!)</p> <p> <strong> iang8 </strong><br> How's the VFR800 running? Cracked a ton fifty yet? Or have you already traded up to something faster? <br> SF or fiction, if you could write only one? </p> <p><strong> IainMBanks</strong><br> Actually it's a 750 (it's three years old now). Cracked the ton while running-in (look, the instructions were don't take it above 8000 in any gear, so I was heading down the M90 one day and thought I'd see what that equated to in top gear, head tucked in. Imagine my surprise when it turned out to be 120! I sat up very rapidly, braked gently and too a sweaty look round for officers of the law). <br> SF. Prob'ly.</p> <p> <strong>kudra</strong><br> So much of what would once have been considered sci-fi has come to pass (genetic modification, cyberspace...) - where does that leave sci-fi writing? What do you think about the sci-fi writing that's around at the moment - is it currently in a fertile or fallow state? </p> <p><strong>IainMBanks</strong><br> SF will be fine as long as there's S, basically. I think the genre's pretty healthy right now.</p> <p> <strong>drella23</strong><br> Not being an SF fan, I've read most of your non-M books, but none of your M ones. Don't you feel that your choice of bylines will prejudice potential readers (either positively or negatively) and ghettoise your genre fiction? Or is it just my fault for not being prepared to look beyond the convention-attending dweebs and discover a whole new avenue of literary wonder? </p> <p><strong>IainMBanks</strong><br> Could do, but it prevents ambiguity. And it's always worth trying new things...</p> <p> <strong>oharar</strong><br> It's sometimes said that a writer's first novel is autobiographical. How true was this for you? Did it cause any of your relatives to sit up and say \"So, it wasn't an accident!\"? </p> <p><strong>IainMBanks</strong><br> Totally un-. And No.</p> <p> <strong>BCOS6</strong><br> I love your M-less books, however I have not gone down the SF road yet. Why do you seperate the two genres with your two names? It's almost as if you don't want people to accidently buy the wrong one... </p> <p><strong>IainMBanks</strong><br> Correct! Also my family gave me some grief for leaving the M out of the mainstream ones...</p> <p> <strong>Maynard78</strong><br> Do you think imagination is a gift or can it be taught and nurtured? </p> <p><strong>IainMBanks</strong><br> I strongly suspect it's a gift, and if it can be taught or nurtured it's only for a fairly brief period in childhood. But, hey; I'm no expert.</p> <p> <strong>tanyaj</strong><br> How does one write a novel? </p> <p><strong>IainMBanks</strong><br> To the best of one's abilities.</p> <p> <strong>Domo2000</strong><br> With a bit of luck our material abundance will let us live something like the Culture, one day. But after all the material and political crap is sorted out, the only remaining Utopian bit left to consider is love, sex and relationships. At first, your Culture writings on this solely portrayed rampant promiscuity. I don't have your books to hand, but the self-imposed exile of the pregnant lady (Excession) who'd been cheated on, after firm commitments of love and faithfulness, is obviously different. So too with the star of The Business, infatuated with a man despite (or because) of his total commitment to his wife. (Sorry, I'm no good with names). <br> Would you agree that there's a balance between the pre-60's miserable marriage lock-in on the one hand, and shallow bed hopping on the other? Not that sexual pleasure cannot be enjoyed without marriage. Nor that anyone should ever be constrained from ending an unhappy relationship by society. But, that experimentation should not eclipse the fact that committed love is usually/often the ideal state for human happiness? <br> PS Any tips for not getting shafted by publishers when trying to get a book published? </p> <p><strong>IainMBanks</strong><br> Tricky; I always have the get-out that the Culture isn't us; not exactly the same species at all, and therefore their nature isn't ours (and has anyway been heavily interfered with through genetic manipulation). But generally I'd agree with the sort of balanced approach you're talking about. <br> Publishers: get a good agent.</p> <p> <strong>rossmi2</strong><br> Are you planning a sequel to Use of Weapons? At the end of the book, there was what appeared to be the opening chapter of a sequel. Also, have you been approached or have plans to turn any culture books into films, and if so, which one would you prefer was filmed. </p> <p><strong>IainMBanks</strong><br> No; I don't tend to do sequels. The last bit of UoW is there to imply that another story, similar to Zakalwe's (even down to Sma's involvement and some history to do with a [wheel] chair) is about to begin, and has been at least partially instigated by Z's own actions. And of course Z is back to his old tricks too, because both the prologue and the epilogue take place after the main action of the book. So it all continues... <br> Yup; Pathe have optioned Player of Games, though the one I'd really like to see is Phlebas...</p> <p> <strong>Keith68</strong><br> Thanks for all the words you've written. <br> Is the separation of your writings, using a middle initial for your science fiction works, a method to combat schizophrenia? Perhaps that is too strong a word (I apologise), but there seems to be an amount of writing without constraint, or flexing of imagination in your science fiction. Do both styles go hand in hand or is there an amount of cause and effect. That is, is the SF a result of frustration at the constraints of realism in your novels set in the present day? <br> PS Do you enjoy SF films, and which ones in particular? </p> <p><strong>IainMBanks</strong><br> Not schizophrenia. There is more unconstrained fun to be had writing the SF, but it's not any sort of therapy. <br> Yes. Dark Star is still probably my fave.</p> <p> <strong>wheeler66</strong><br> Does political passion drive your desire to write, or is it merely a theme you enjoy? <br> Who intends to retire first: Iain Banks or Iain M. Banks? Or will they both live forever? </p> <p><strong>IainMBanks</strong><br> No. Wish it did. <br> Neither would give the other satisfaction, though both are taking a year off from the start of September.</p> <p> <strong>jcmullen99</strong><br> Thanks again for Look to Windward! <br> If rumours of your taking a year or so 'out' from writing are to be believed, can we look forward to your arrival on the virtual scene soon? <br> A IB/IMB website would be very popular! Or would that cut across what you are doing? Or is that rumour just a rumour?! </p> <p><strong>IainMBanks</strong><br> Yes. My Install CD from madasafish is lying at home even as I write to you from here, the throbbing heart of the Guardian/Observer empire (at 15.43 on 23.8.00 according to my watch). <br> Website designing might be a laugh. I'll see how easy it is...</p> <p> <strong>leperman</strong><br> I have read and tremendously enjoyed all your work, both the sci-fi and contemporary novels. But one thing has been bothering me for years - what was the very end of 'Use of Weapons' all about? I read and re-read it several times, but am still at a loss. Please help a confused soul. </p> <p><strong>IainMBanks</strong><br> I refer my honourable friend to the answer given above (to rossmi2). The clue that the prologue/epilogue bits both happen not long after the main story is Zakalwe pushing his hand through long hair that isn't there any more (after he cuts it all off just before the enemy storm the citadel once the dirty deal has been done on... umm... I've forgotten the name of the planet). Make sense?</p> <p><strong>craigmcgill1</strong><br> Two words: Greenock Morton. What can you say to that? </p> <p> <strong>IainMBanks</strong><br> You mean The Mighty 'Ton? I'd say, \"Will you please stop calling them Mortonnill?\" to my wife. She seems to think it's funny...</p> <p><strong>davegolder</strong><br> What is it with The Wasteland?</p> <p><strong>IainMBanks</strong><br> It's just a jolly fine poem, is all. I don't know; it's always seemed to resonate with me, despite the fact I disagree with almost everything TSE stood for.</p> <p><strong> aclandi </strong><br> Thanks for the books. I'm interested to know about the significance of T. S. Eliot's \"The Waste Land\" part IV as title references for the first and latest Culture novels. Is the drowned Phoenician symbolic of the hubris of first the Idirans and then the Culture itself? More worryingly, does this indicate a full circle and that there will be no more Culture novels? Or are you just a fan of Eliot? </p> <p><strong>IainMBanks</strong><br> Fan of Eliot. As for the Culture, like I said earlier - if I can borrow one of Arnie's lines - I'll be back (well, probably). The drowned mariner seemed like a good image to evoke for what is arguably just a tale of a shipwrecked sailor who falls in with a gang of pirates and goes in search of buried treasure on an enchanted isle guarded by a sleeping dragon... Plus there is a sea-change, right on the surface of the sea, when Horza Changes to resemble Kraiklyn...</p> <p><strong>JakeHulme</strong><br> I'm a big fan of both your mainstream and SF books - I don't see a conflict between the two. However, do you have any intentions towards, or thoughts on, a novel that bridges the gap between the two? I ask because I feel that Consider Phlebas (along with Neuromancer) rejuvenated SF literature just when it needed it, but the two have very different themes - Phlebas (and a lot of your other SF books) have been of the 'space opera' style, whereas Gibson is more near-future. Recent writers (I'm thinking of Jeff Noon and Michael Marshall Smith in particular) seem to have followed Gibson's path, but with elements of the fantastical that echo yours. It seems to me that there could be a place where your mainstream and SF themes intersect. </p> <p><strong>IainMBanks</strong><br> Hmm... doubt it. In a sense this conjunction has already occured (twice, arguably). It's there in The State of the Art, and - so people keep telling me - in The Business, which some people have seen as the possible starting point for something like the Culture on Earth (I'm more sceptical). Still, I know what you mean, but... probably not.</p> <p><strong>adaldan</strong><br> Mmhh. You see, I have been arguing about the death penalty with a lot of people lately, mainly from the USA. And I have always thought that the claim that the Culture was really a thinly-disguised USA was risible... but now you go and have a Culture entity acting on revenge and retaliation, even resorting to torture. Means to an end, eh? Not a Culture agent like Zakalwe, but a Culture entity... and not in self-defence either. This margin is too small to say exhaustively why, but it troubled me. It echoed some of the arguments of the pro-death people. I'd hate to think that you didn't share my opinions! ;-) <br> But LTW is such a gentle, almost tender book. Did I miss something? Perhaps I have idealised the Culture too much, much more than you yourself did? <br> Or perhaps you owe us another book about this. :-)</p> <p><strong>IainMBanks</strong><br> I am absolutely against the death penalty. I think if Scotland brought it back and England didn't, I'd go and live... well, in Berwick probably... <br> Also, the Culture doesn't just not have a death penalty, it doesn't even have an imprisoning penalty. <br> All I can say is that at this sort of level - the realpolitik level of attempting to prevent the sort of attack that might kill billions of civilians - even the Culture throws away its usual moral rule-book. This is what SC is for, in a sense. That doesn't make such actions right, just less wrong, and arguably less wrong that not acting at all or, as I said earlier, acting in too predictably. <br> Besides; I've always said the Culture is as close as something remotely like us could ever get to a genuine Utopian state; I never said it was perfect</p> <p><strong>craigmcgill1</strong><br> You once mentioned a possibility of a sequel to Wasp Factory - I take it that's a dead duck now? Would you do it for a daft amount of money or would you always knock it back if you didn't think there was a top tale in it? <br> Also, who's on your reading list these days? Do you like stuff by folk like Chris Brookmyre? </p> <p> <strong>IainMBanks</strong><br> Not much deader than it ever was. I'd do it if I thought of a total cracker of an idea that would carry the book beyond the initial idea (though I think this is unlikely to happen). I don't think I would if it was just for money. But then ask me when/if I'm poor and maybe I'd change my mind.</p> <p> <strong>lovefunk</strong><br> You write such rich books which get to the crux of human imagination and experience. I've always wanted to be a writer, but work for an internet start-up company instead. This choice of a career has taught me a lot about myself.

Please could you tell me what writing has made you into in your eyes? What have you learnt about yourself as you have gone along the way? This is a bit personal, but I do see my own strengths and weaknesses quite clearly. I can hold a convincing argument, and am genuinely interested in everyone I meet, and every experience I have. On the down side, there is something that I am fighting to keep alive in me as I get older (a grand 27 has been clocked so far), and more in touch with my innards. A real battle that creates energy and fear. If I don't fight, I believe that old age will be hard and full of bitterness and regrets. <br> In sum, the question was, what has writing made you into? And, what have you learnt about yourself as you have gone along the way? </p> <p><strong>IainMBanks</strong><br> I have to say I don't know. It's made me a writer, I guess, but then that seems a trivial answer. The problem is that I've wanted to be a writer since I was in primary school, and I've either been trying hard to make it happen - or actually been a writer - ever since.

They suggested that such enormously powerful and intellectually refined entities ought to have names with a little more gravitas, to reflect their near-god-like status; the immediate and sustained reaction of one of the Culture's ship manufacturies was to name all its subsequent vessels things like: Stood Far Back When The Gravitas Was Handed Out; Gravitas, What Gravitas?; Gravitas... Gravitas... No, Don't Help Me, I'll Get It In A Moment; Gravitas Free Zone; Low Gravitas Warning Signal, etc etc (including the Zen-like Absolutely No You-No-What).

      "bodyText": "IainMBanks Right; I'm here. Ask away... Iain Banks (and Iain M Banks) blackbird21 Which science fiction writers do you admire? IainMBanks Um, lots. (There's a list, but it's a bit long...) desaic Would you ever consider publishing an e-book? (I'm sure you're popular enough for it to be worthwhile financially.) IainMBanks I don't know yet. I tend to leave all the hard stuff to my publishers. So if it was easy... maybe. prakp The Culture tries to assimilate new peoples gradually. It uses persuasion, reason, direction and the odd dirty trick rather than overt conquest - despite (or perhaps because of) any invasions or wars it may have started in the past. (I haven't read Windward yet!) Is this policy a deliberate echo of the way the West no longer colonises by force but instead achieves similar ends through cultural and economic imperialism and the aggressive promotion of democracy? IainMBanks Sort of, yes. Except the Culture doesn't have its own economic self-interest at heart, so it's nicer. adaldan Well, I tried to sort of ration LTW, but past page 100 there's no stopping, is there. I liked it a lot, it was funny, grandiose, sad and sulking in more or less equal parts, though I felt you cheated a little bit. ;-) But I was a little puzzled by something towards the end. I will try to not spoil things for anybody but I have to ask: that is not how the Culture is supposed to act, is it? IainMBanks Not exactly. But behaving wildly (and viciously) out of character means that the bad-guys can't ever exactly predict they can get away with before the Culture steps in, or how bad the retribution will be. And of course, there's lots of different tendencies within SC... Maybe it was just a nasty Mind on the duty roster that day. jrkennedy Are you fed up with writing Culture novels or do you think they will run and run? IainMBanks Not fed up. I've no definite plans for the next one and it's probably a long way down the line if/when it does happen, but I find it hard to imagine I won't write about the Culture again. smainprize Your last couple of \"M-less\" books have in one way or another been set in a world that isn't *quite* the real one... are you planning to write any more novels set in real-world situations? I'm thinking of Complicity and The Crow Road, which are my favourites of all your books. IainMBanks Again, no set plans, but I imagine there'll be a real-world mainstream book before too long. etolstoy Enjoy your books. Where do you get the motivation from for each story? People you know? Or random paths you would like to follow and see where they lead? IainMBanks Never people I know (too dangerous - I need all the friends I can get and have no desire to get biffed on the nose because someone thought their portrait was unflattering). As an example of where the ideas originate, the genesis of Look To Windward came from thinking about the pattern of the earlier books, where somebody from the Culture goes to another civilisation (and has lots of exciting adventures, and... reversing the polarity!) iang8 How's the VFR800 running? Cracked a ton fifty yet? Or have you already traded up to something faster? SF or fiction, if you could write only one? IainMBanks Actually it's a 750 (it's three years old now). Cracked the ton while running-in (look, the instructions were don't take it above 8000 in any gear, so I was heading down the M90 one day and thought I'd see what that equated to in top gear, head tucked in. Imagine my surprise when it turned out to be 120! I sat up very rapidly, braked gently and too a sweaty look round for officers of the law). SF. Prob'ly. kudra So much of what would once have been considered sci-fi has come to pass (genetic modification, cyberspace...) - where does that leave sci-fi writing? What do you think about the sci-fi writing that's around at the moment - is it currently in a fertile or fallow state? IainMBanks SF will be fine as long as there's S, basically. I think the genre's pretty healthy right now. drella23 Not being an SF fan, I've read most of your non-M books, but none of your M ones. Don't you feel that your choice of bylines will prejudice potential readers (either positively or negatively) and ghettoise your genre fiction? Or is it just my fault for not being prepared to look beyond the convention-attending dweebs and discover a whole new avenue of literary wonder? IainMBanks Could do, but it prevents ambiguity. And it's always worth trying new things... oharar It's sometimes said that a writer's first novel is autobiographical. How true was this for you? Did it cause any of your relatives to sit up and say \"So, it wasn't an accident!\"? IainMBanks Totally un-. And No. BCOS6 I love your M-less books, however I have not gone down the SF road yet. Why do you seperate the two genres with your two names? It's almost as if you don't want people to accidently buy the wrong one... IainMBanks Correct! Also my family gave me some grief for leaving the M out of the mainstream ones... Maynard78 Do you think imagination is a gift or can it be taught and nurtured? IainMBanks I strongly suspect it's a gift, and if it can be taught or nurtured it's only for a fairly brief period in childhood. But, hey; I'm no expert. tanyaj How does one write a novel? IainMBanks To the best of one's abilities. Domo2000 With a bit of luck our material abundance will let us live something like the Culture, one day. But after all the material and political crap is sorted out, the only remaining Utopian bit left to consider is love, sex and relationships. At first, your Culture writings on this solely portrayed rampant promiscuity. I don't have your books to hand, but the self-imposed exile of the pregnant lady (Excession) who'd been cheated on, after firm commitments of love and faithfulness, is obviously different. So too with the star of The Business, infatuated with a man despite (or because) of his total commitment to his wife. (Sorry, I'm no good with names). Would you agree that there's a balance between the pre-60's miserable marriage lock-in on the one hand, and shallow bed hopping on the other? Not that sexual pleasure cannot be enjoyed without marriage. Nor that anyone should ever be constrained from ending an unhappy relationship by society. But, that experimentation should not eclipse the fact that committed love is usually/often the ideal state for human happiness? PS Any tips for not getting shafted by publishers when trying to get a book published? IainMBanks Tricky; I always have the get-out that the Culture isn't us; not exactly the same species at all, and therefore their nature isn't ours (and has anyway been heavily interfered with through genetic manipulation). But generally I'd agree with the sort of balanced approach you're talking about. Publishers: get a good agent. rossmi2 Are you planning a sequel to Use of Weapons? At the end of the book, there was what appeared to be the opening chapter of a sequel. Also, have you been approached or have plans to turn any culture books into films, and if so, which one would you prefer was filmed. IainMBanks No; I don't tend to do sequels. The last bit of UoW is there to imply that another story, similar to Zakalwe's (even down to Sma's involvement and some history to do with a [wheel] chair) is about to begin, and has been at least partially instigated by Z's own actions. And of course Z is back to his old tricks too, because both the prologue and the epilogue take place after the main action of the book. So it all continues... Yup; Pathe have optioned Player of Games, though the one I'd really like to see is Phlebas... Keith68 Thanks for all the words you've written. Is the separation of your writings, using a middle initial for your science fiction works, a method to combat schizophrenia? Perhaps that is too strong a word (I apologise), but there seems to be an amount of writing without constraint, or flexing of imagination in your science fiction. Do both styles go hand in hand or is there an amount of cause and effect. That is, is the SF a result of frustration at the constraints of realism in your novels set in the present day? PS Do you enjoy SF films, and which ones in particular? IainMBanks Not schizophrenia. There is more unconstrained fun to be had writing the SF, but it's not any sort of therapy. Yes. Dark Star is still probably my fave. wheeler66 Does political passion drive your desire to write, or is it merely a theme you enjoy? Who intends to retire first: Iain Banks or Iain M. Banks? Or will they both live forever? IainMBanks No. Wish it did. Neither would give the other satisfaction, though both are taking a year off from the start of September. jcmullen99 Thanks again for Look to Windward! If rumours of your taking a year or so 'out' from writing are to be believed, can we look forward to your arrival on the virtual scene soon? A IB/IMB website would be very popular! Or would that cut across what you are doing? Or is that rumour just a rumour?! IainMBanks Yes. My Install CD from madasafish is lying at home even as I write to you from here, the throbbing heart of the Guardian/Observer empire (at 15.43 on 23.8.00 according to my watch). Website designing might be a laugh. I'll see how easy it is... leperman I have read and tremendously enjoyed all your work, both the sci-fi and contemporary novels. But one thing has been bothering me for years - what was the very end of 'Use of Weapons' all about? I read and re-read it several times, but am still at a loss. Please help a confused soul. IainMBanks I refer my honourable friend to the answer given above (to rossmi2). The clue that the prologue/epilogue bits both happen not long after the main story is Zakalwe pushing his hand through long hair that isn't there any more (after he cuts it all off just before the enemy storm the citadel once the dirty deal has been done on... umm... I've forgotten the name of the planet). Make sense? craigmcgill1 Two words: Greenock Morton. What can you say to that? IainMBanks You mean The Mighty 'Ton? I'd say, \"Will you please stop calling them Mortonnill?\" to my wife. She seems to think it's funny... davegolder What is it with The Wasteland? IainMBanks It's just a jolly fine poem, is all. I don't know; it's always seemed to resonate with me, despite the fact I disagree with almost everything TSE stood for. aclandi Thanks for the books. I'm interested to know about the significance of T. S. Eliot's \"The Waste Land\" part IV as title references for the first and latest Culture novels. Is the drowned Phoenician symbolic of the hubris of first the Idirans and then the Culture itself? More worryingly, does this indicate a full circle and that there will be no more Culture novels? Or are you just a fan of Eliot? IainMBanks Fan of Eliot. As for the Culture, like I said earlier - if I can borrow one of Arnie's lines - I'll be back (well, probably). The drowned mariner seemed like a good image to evoke for what is arguably just a tale of a shipwrecked sailor who falls in with a gang of pirates and goes in search of buried treasure on an enchanted isle guarded by a sleeping dragon... Plus there is a sea-change, right on the surface of the sea, when Horza Changes to resemble Kraiklyn... JakeHulme I'm a big fan of both your mainstream and SF books - I don't see a conflict between the two. However, do you have any intentions towards, or thoughts on, a novel that bridges the gap between the two? I ask because I feel that Consider Phlebas (along with Neuromancer) rejuvenated SF literature just when it needed it, but the two have very different themes - Phlebas (and a lot of your other SF books) have been of the 'space opera' style, whereas Gibson is more near-future. Recent writers (I'm thinking of Jeff Noon and Michael Marshall Smith in particular) seem to have followed Gibson's path, but with elements of the fantastical that echo yours. It seems to me that there could be a place where your mainstream and SF themes intersect. IainMBanks Hmm... doubt it. In a sense this conjunction has already occured (twice, arguably). It's there in The State of the Art, and - so people keep telling me - in The Business, which some people have seen as the possible starting point for something like the Culture on Earth (I'm more sceptical). Still, I know what you mean, but... probably not. adaldan Mmhh. You see, I have been arguing about the death penalty with a lot of people lately, mainly from the USA. And I have always thought that the claim that the Culture was really a thinly-disguised USA was risible... but now you go and have a Culture entity acting on revenge and retaliation, even resorting to torture. Means to an end, eh? Not a Culture agent like Zakalwe, but a Culture entity... and not in self-defence either. This margin is too small to say exhaustively why, but it troubled me. It echoed some of the arguments of the pro-death people. I'd hate to think that you didn't share my opinions! ;-) But LTW is such a gentle, almost tender book. Did I miss something? Perhaps I have idealised the Culture too much, much more than you yourself did? Or perhaps you owe us another book about this. :-) IainMBanks I am absolutely against the death penalty. I think if Scotland brought it back and England didn't, I'd go and live... well, in Berwick probably... Also, the Culture doesn't just not have a death penalty, it doesn't even have an imprisoning penalty. All I can say is that at this sort of level - the realpolitik level of attempting to prevent the sort of attack that might kill billions of civilians - even the Culture throws away its usual moral rule-book. This is what SC is for, in a sense. That doesn't make such actions right, just less wrong, and arguably less wrong that not acting at all or, as I said earlier, acting in too predictably. Besides; I've always said the Culture is as close as something remotely like us could ever get to a genuine Utopian state; I never said it was perfect craigmcgill1 You once mentioned a possibility of a sequel to Wasp Factory - I take it that's a dead duck now? Would you do it for a daft amount of money or would you always knock it back if you didn't think there was a top tale in it? Also, who's on your reading list these days? Do you like stuff by folk like Chris Brookmyre? IainMBanks Not much deader than it ever was. I'd do it if I thought of a total cracker of an idea that would carry the book beyond the initial idea (though I think this is unlikely to happen). I don't think I would if it was just for money. But then ask me when/if I'm poor and maybe I'd change my mind. lovefunk You write such rich books which get to the crux of human imagination and experience. I've always wanted to be a writer, but work for an internet start-up company instead. This choice of a career has taught me a lot about myself. Generally, the industry's culture gives you alot of reward for your toils, and if you are unlucky or not cut out for the job, a lot of cable to hang yourself with. Anyway, my question to you is about your career and the sort of person you are. Please could you tell me what writing has made you into in your eyes?

IainMBanks Film options of Espedair Street, The Bridge and The Player of Games. Wasp Factory still in litigation. In all cases, don't hold your breath. MACGreen Have you ever considered writing for videogames? Can we expect to see an Iain M Banks Space Opera for PlayStation 2 anytime soon? IainMBanks Briefly. But I am not a team player, so it won't happen. So, not by my hand. Domo2000 Is there a chance that you'll feature more on the sublimed entities, from the Culture Mythos? Or do you think it's best to maintain the mystery of something that is altogether beyond our comprehension? Haven't read Windward yet though, only saw it for the first time yesterday. IainMBanks Doubtful. Maintain the mystery, and don't try to think unthinkabilities... woody01 Thank you for all those great books, I especially enjoyed The Bridge, Walking on Glass, State of the Art, Feersum Endjinn and Inversions. Are your novels influenced by paintings and music ? I'm thinking of the reference to Magritte's paintings in Walking on Glass, and of a composer as the main character in your new Look to Windward. And another question: What do you think of the Episode 1 of Star Wars and the Star Wars prequels in general?

Was it a precocious talent or did it require some dedication? One more: any particular incidents along the way that inspired you to continue trying to be a writer? IainMBanks I tried writing my first novel when I was fourteen (thought I had, too, till I did a word-count) and wrote something resembling one when I was sixteen (the snappily titled The Hungarian Lift-Jet). It was precocious something, that's for sure, and it needed a lot of dedication. Luckily I dedicate fast, as it were. Not really, though the long-term encouragement of friends helped.

Under pressure to succeed from the first kick of the season, results have not been great, and even Luca himself has admitted that Chelsea's of Chelsea don't always appear to be up for it. But instead of buckling, or running naked through the sewers, Luca has responded smartly to each setback by spending some more of Ken Bates's money. In the summer, Luca signed Christian Panucci, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, Eidur Gudjohnsen and Mario Stanic. When that quartet couldn't stop the Blues losing to Bradford, Luca signed Winston Bogarde. And now that Chelsea are without a win since the opening day, it seems he's about to spend \u00a310m on Real Madrid's Savio. Now that's commitment.</p> <p>Savio looks like becoming the odd man out at the Bernabeu after Steve 'Che' McManaman's successful bid to stay with the Big Cup winners. Real's Jorge Valdano has told the nippy Brazilian that he can leave, and he appears to have accepted the decision. \"I spoke to Jorge Valdano and he made Real's position crystal clear,\" Savio said today. \"They are not prepared to improve my existing contract and therefore will let me listen to offers. The Premiership is one of the strongest leagues in the world and I am flattered by Chelsea's interest.\" (Why always flattered? What's wrong with \"aroused\" or \"mildly embarassed\"?)</p> <p>Anyway, uninspired agent-ese aside, you don't get much clearer indications of an unsettled footballer than that. Chuck in a few quotes from a Real spokesman like \"we believe we have completed a deal with Chelsea for Savio\" and \"a lot of clubs have shown an interest in the player but he wants to play in England and we are not prepared to sell him to another Spanish club\", and Robert is your parents' friend from down the road who insists on being called Uncle despite having no blood relation whatsoever.

Oh look, here come West Ham. You're On Sky Sports! (10.30pm, 3am) \"He was thrust onto the ITV team for the 1994 World Cup and put in a series of unforgettably bad performances.\" Is Martin Zatko talking about McCaff, Kamara or former ITV World Cup presenter Matthew Lorenzo? Sky Sports 2: Football League Review (5.30pm, 6.30pm SS1, 11.30pm SS1) One thing's for sure - he wasn't talking about the bloke who does the voiceover for this, whatever his name is. Sky Sports 3: Brian Moore Interviews (11pm) Charlie Hurley, who is presumably not the father of Liz. British Eurosport: Eurogoals (10.15pm) All the goals you'll ever want to see.

      "body": "<p>If you don't really know what kind of car you want, this could be the one for you. You quite like 4x4s, but then they're a bit tacky and showy aren't they, especially on the school run? You've got a kid, or two, but you haven't quite surrendered your youth and secretly you'd like to be driving around in something fun, probably with no seats in the back. You're definitely not quite ready to go down the Volvo estate route anyway. You probably have some sort of outdoor pursuit you like to pursue at weekends. And there could be a cottage, possibly in Wales. Oh, and you've got \u00a336,630 to spend on a car. </p> <p>If you do have \u00a336,630 to spend on a car you could do a lot worse than spend it on this one. It is killer. First of all it looks great doesn't it? Underneath it's an Audi A6 estate - or Avant as they insist on calling it (the word estate seems to have been dropped by carmakers as a turn off, but Avant is a lot more embarrassing). Anyway, the A6 Avant has been sent to the gym. It's higher, wider and chunkier. Toned in fact, but not too much. The Audi allroad is Pitt, not Schwarzenegger. </p> <p>It's good inside too. The posher the car, the more cut off you feel from the outside world, and when the door of this one clunks classily shut you feel totally cocooned in your own smug leathery little world. Nice. Mine had a modern dark green interior, which was almost successful but spoilt by the obligatory strip of walnut veneer. It seems that if you spend a lot of money on a car you expect to see the evidence that a tree has died in its making, even if it looks all wrong. But you are rich, and this is your right. Otherwise it's comfortable and elegant, with all the seat positions, lumber support options, cupholders and mapflaps you'd expect for your 30 grand. </p> <p>We went to Shropshire - which is almost Wales - to a cottage. It was bank holiday, and the roads were chocker. But this car is even fun in a traffic jam. Small cars look up at you enviously. And the big Shoguns and Landcruisers look down jealously too, because they know you've got something altogether more desirable. Once you've basked in that for a bit you can make the GPS navigation map zoom right in so it even tells you the names of all the canals you're crossing - quite educational, no? OK, how about this? Practise your Spanish by switching the navigation language: \"Siga por la caraterra hasta nuevo aviso.\" And then forget how to turn it back to English so it only speaks Spanish, for ever. The real fun begins when the traffic grinds completely to a halt, as then it allows you to switch on the telly. Big Brother on the M6, how about that? </p> <p>Off the motorway at last, and it all kicks in: 2.7 litres, V6, 250bhp, permanent all-wheel drive. The allroad drives more like a sports car than an estate - I mean Avant. Big 4x4s feel uncomfortable on fast A roads; not this one. If you want to take part in the experience a bit more, you can switch from automatic to Tiptronic so you can flip through the gears yourself. Wey-hey. Sorry if this is all getting a bit boysy, but it felt boysy. In this car you really do feel like you could take on the world. And win. </p> <p>So it's great on the road, but what about off it? We tried to find some steps to drive up, like in the advert, but there aren't any like that in Oswestry. But we did find a muddy track that disappeared ominously into a forest. This car has four different height settings, ranging from low for cruising fast along motorways to high for steps and muddy tracks. You just press the button on the dashboard and up you rise, as silently as a souffl\u00e9 - and if you forget, it will change automatically of course, to suit the road. </p> <p>There's something not quite right about getting this car all dirty. Not that it doesn't cope well - it took mud, rocks, steep sideways slopes all in its stride, much more capably then any of those so-called sports utility vehicles. But when we emerged on the other side of the forest looking bloodied and muddied with twigs and leaves hanging off all over the place, it seemed a terrible shame: we'd been so shiny and elegant half an hour before. Like playing rugby in an Armani suit. Except that an Armani suit isn't great to play rugby in, whereas this car is great to drive along muddy tracks in. In a Land Rover you want to get all messy, but in this one you're probably better off in the knowledge that you can, rather than actually doing it. </p> <p>Another small moan. The navigation system had no idea where it was in the lanes of Shropshire, and kept on telling us so, still in Spanish of course. And on the way back to London it went into a complete sulk and absolutely refused to tell us where to go. Also the TV reception wasn't so great up there... But that - and the walnut - aside, this car is gorgeous, and you should get one. If you've got \u00a336,630 to spend on a car of course. </p> <p><strong> The lowdown</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Audi allroad quattro </strong></p> <p><strong>Price: </strong> \u00a336,630.

The real fun begins when the traffic grinds completely to a halt, as then it allows you to switch on the telly. Big Brother on the M6, how about that? Off the motorway at last, and it all kicks in: 2.7 litres, V6, 250bhp, permanent all-wheel drive. The allroad drives more like a sports car than an estate - I mean Avant. Big 4x4s feel uncomfortable on fast A roads; not this one. If you want to take part in the experience a bit more, you can switch from automatic to Tiptronic so you can flip through the gears yourself. Wey-hey. Sorry if this is all getting a bit boysy, but it felt boysy. In this car you really do feel like you could take on the world. And win. So it's great on the road, but what about off it? We tried to find some steps to drive up, like in the advert, but there aren't any like that in Oswestry. But we did find a muddy track that disappeared ominously into a forest. This car has four different height settings, ranging from low for cruising fast along motorways to high for steps and muddy tracks. You just press the button on the dashboard and up you rise, as silently as a souffl\u00e9 - and if you forget, it will change automatically of course, to suit the road. There's something not quite right about getting this car all dirty. Not that it doesn't cope well - it took mud, rocks, steep sideways slopes all in its stride, much more capably then any of those so-called sports utility vehicles. But when we emerged on the other side of the forest looking bloodied and muddied with twigs and leaves hanging off all over the place, it seemed a terrible shame: we'd been so shiny and elegant half an hour before. Like playing rugby in an Armani suit. Except that an Armani suit isn't great to play rugby in, whereas this car is great to drive along muddy tracks in. In a Land Rover you want to get all messy, but in this one you're probably better off in the knowledge that you can, rather than actually doing it. Another small moan. The navigation system had no idea where it was in the lanes of Shropshire, and kept on telling us so, still in Spanish of course. And on the way back to London it went into a complete sulk and absolutely refused to tell us where to go. Also the TV reception wasn't so great up there... But that - and the walnut - aside, this car is gorgeous, and you should get one. If you've got \u00a336,630 to spend on a car of course. The lowdown Audi allroad quattro Price: \u00a336,630. (The turbodiesel is \u00a332,550 but it only does 129mph) Top speed: 147mph 0-60mph: 7.4 seconds Consumption: 15.7mpg (urban) On the stereo: Ride of the Valkyries At the wheel: You - in your dreams Where to go: Anywhere",

You may not have heard of him, but governments around the world are apparently queuing up to hear what the Peruvian thinker has to say. Egypt, Romania, Haiti and Mexico, as well as his home country, are seeking and implementing his advice in a bid to transform their economies. Geoff Mulgan, head of the Number 10 policy unit, had him in to Downing Street. The World Bank is pouring huge sums into his projects. The Economist ranks his Lima-based institute as the second most important thinktank in the world. De Soto is pitching himself as a third way guru and it's working.

The weakest assertion at the heart of the bundle of ideas lumped together by a loose alliance of Tony Blair, Bill Clinton, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der and other left-of-centre leaders such as the Brazilian Fernando Cardoso, is that capitalism can distribute wealth widely. The evidence is to the contrary; recent history seems to be proving the Marxist claim that, inevitably, a capitalist system concentrates wealth in fewer hands, thus sowing the seeds for its collapse. </p> <p>Walk on de Soto. His appeal lies in large part because he doesn't challenge the status quo; he accepts capitalism is the only economic system on offer. What he focuses on is the huge black economy that operates outside the legal system in all countries, particularly in the developing world and former Soviet bloc. In the extralegal economy, the poor accumulate huge assets in their shanty homes and small businesses, but because they have no legal protections, they cannot access credit nor can they safely invest. Their assets are thus \"dead capital\" as opposed to \"live capital\" in the west. The big idea can basically be summed up as: \"It's property law, stupid.\" </p> <p>De Soto has made a useful point. The underground market in Russia and Ukraine accounts for 50% of GDP and 62% in Georgia. According to his institute's inventory, as much as 90% of Cairo's economy is extralegal. In his emphasis on the enormous entrepreneurial energies of the poor, and that they know better than any policymaker how to improve their lot, de Soto should be shifting the minds of politicians and donor governments in the right direction. Perhaps he can help uncouple the ideas of poverty and laziness that still lurk behind some compassion fatigue towards developing countries. After all, in many countries it is the entrepreneurial resourcefulness of some of the most marginalised - women traders in west Africa for example - who ensure that millions of people are fed and clothed. </p> <p> But what this most certainly does not amount to is a big idea to solve global poverty. Gathering around de Soto is a semi-hysterical spinning that ludicrously compares him to Adam Smith and Karl Marx. His book, The Mystery of Capital, is breathless, grandiose, and claims to have fathomed \"secrets\" and \"mysteries\". But if that's what it takes to get a book that baldly states that globalisation is not working for five-sixths of the world's population on to the US bestseller charts, then more power to his elbow. </p> <p>Governments do need to devise ways to hook the extralegal economy into the formal economy. Opt into the system and you get access to credit to invest in your home and business, and you don't have to pay bribes to the mafia. De Soto claims his theory is backed up by what happened in the fast-track scheme he designed for small business under President Fujimori's government in Peru, when 276,000 businesses voluntarily opted for legalisation. </p> <p>But what de Soto doesn't acknowledge is that the balance of benefit between staying out of the system and opting in can be delicate or even tipped firmly against. Perhaps for shanty dwellers in Brazil or market stall holders in Kiev, the local mafia has far more clout than any government. To them, legalisation only doubles their burden, adding taxes to the bribes they will have to carry on paying. </p> <p>The laws a country makes and how they are enforced reflect the disposition of political power - and that is determined by who has economic power. De Soto's work is an elaborate smokescreen to hide the uglier truth. The power, political and economic, lies with the globalised elite in developing countries who are often employed or bullied by western multinationals, and who run those countries for the maximum extractive benefit of the west. We import their raw commodities at rock bottom prices, and export back to them manufactured goods; we restrict their manufactured exports and we charge high levels of interest on their debts. None of that, of course, gets a hearing in de Soto's work, which is no doubt partly because his CV includes a stint as an economist for Gatt (the precursor of the WTO) and as the chief executive officer of \"one of Europe's largest engineering firms\". This is touchy, feely capitalism with a heart.

In other words the correct price for an average Premiership away side to win at lowly Bradford would be over 3/1. Obviously Arsenal are a much better than average side but are they good enough to warrant a 4/6 quote. Bookies know they will always lay the Arsenals of this world at virtually any price so the chances of them giving away value on such a selection is pretty slim.

As I wrote when discussing Mr MacInnes's bets, four or more goals is not a bet I would generally like to take on at 7/4 let alone 13/8. This, I would agree, did look like a game of goals, with Manchester City leaking and scoring goals in equal measure and Owen hotter than a hot apple pie, but at 13/8 this was all in the price and then some. So congratulations to Mr M for picking out the only one of nine Saturday Premiership matches to produce four or more goals, but there's still a long way to go before he starts turning in a regular profit.</p> <p> <strong>Football Unlimited punters' collective, represented by Jason Langford</strong><br> Liverpool to beat the -1.25 Asian handicap against Manchester City at evens: \u00a310 </p> <p>I'm all in favour of betting on the Asian handicaps but I feel it is probably best to understand the market before taking it on.

      "bodyText": "The most magic moment of a journey through China's Three Gorges has already been irretrievably lost - the dawn chorus of birds as the traveller enters upstream. There are roads carved from the rockface of the first gorge, piles of spoil from construction higher up, and a distant noise of round-the-clock working at the great dam site. And, when the water level is raised as much as 70 metres (230 ft), the dense shrubbery where the birds find refuge will be submerged. Although the project is irreversible, and has been so ever since opposition to it was suppressed more than 10 years ago, the Chinese government is allowing a more critical attitude to filter through - within limits. It is no longer a great and glorious enterprise which cannot possibly be flawed in any respect. This month, the Chinese media published details of a serious accident at the construction site that killed or injured 29 workers. Problems and delays over the relocation of hundreds of thousands of villagers whose homes will be flooded have been admitted. And there has been at least a partial admission of graft involving some of the huge sums earmarked for the project. \"No big embezzlement [of] construction funds has been discovered so far,\" the People's Daily quotes Lu Youmei, president of the China Three Gorges Project Corporation. It is hardly a ringing denial and Mr Lu's deputy used exactly the same careful phrase. \"Overall, no big embezzlement has been found.\" The newspaper report goes on to admit that the situation has been quite different with the funds earmarked for the resettlement programme. \"[Mr Lu's] announcement was made,\" it says, \"at a time when a string of grafters have been sentenced to death, imprisoned or punished for stealing funds [intended] for residents of the reservoir area.\" It cites a report from the National Audit Office suggesting that about 500 million Renminbi (\u00a338.5m) was embezzled. An earlier report in January suggested a much higher figure. The resettlement programme was supposed to move 150,000 people by the end of 1999, 500,000 by 2003 - when the first stage in raising the water level will begin - and up to 1.2m by the time the dam is supposed to be finished in 2009. Yet it is clear that the programme has not only been undermined by graft but is now in disarray. The original plan was to relocate as many people as possible either near their existing locations or not far away. Entire new villages were built at higher levels than the ones to be flooded - even though there was less fertile land. Whole towns were moved uphill with buildings provided for new industries which would supposedly provide jobs. For several years, tourists passing through the Gorges have seen hamlets and villages where every roof of every house has been smashed - to stop squatters moving in and claiming the right to resettlement. New construction on the heights has left ugly scars of debris tipped over the edge. Local people were sceptical but at least the plan gave some hope of improvement after decades in which their region was neglected while Beijing argued over whether or not to build the dam. (It was first proposed in the mid-1950s when Chairman Mao Zedong endorsed it, then postponed again and again). Last year, the policy changed from \"local\" to \"distant\" resettlement after Premier Zhu Rongji took charge of the project and soon realised its flaws. The search for new farming land meant trying to cultivate on steep slopes which would be an environmental disaster. And the new factories were standing idle because no one wants to invest in such a remote area. Migrants are now being sent down river as far as Shanghai and across country to the western provinces as far as Xinjiang. The arrival of a first test group on Chongming Island near Shanghai has been quite fully reported. The move, says the People's Daily, has aroused \"mixed feelings\", and this in a showcase project where the migrants can expect better than average treatment. However, the government and official media cannot admit that any problems arise from the fundamental concept of a \"Big Dam\" which was so nearly rejected in the late 1980s before being taken up by Li Peng - then premier and architect of the Beijing massacre. Too much money and cement has been poured into what is essentially a 1950s project comparable to the Aswan and other dams which seemed so attractive at the time but have created their own disasters. In July, more than 50 senior Chinese engineers and academics submitted a letter of protest to the State Council warning once again that the project was vulnerable to serious silting upstream of the dam. They feared that a compromise agreement in 1992 to limit the dam height (and hopefully the silting up) was now being ignored. The height agreed then was 156 metres (512 ft), but the project managers had now restored the higher and more dangerous level of 175 metres (574 ft). Even at the lower level, the engineers warned, between 200 and 300m tons of silt would flow into the reservoir annually. Not a word of this controversy has appeared in the People's Daily - the letter and other documents were translated by Probe International, a Canada-based NGO that has monitored the Three Gorges story for many years. The greater the error, the harder it is to admit - especially when the prestige of top leaders is involved. The dam is already a monstrous new wonder of the world: the real Chinese experts can only pray that it will not become a world catastrophe some day. Useful links People's Daily Probe International",

      "body": "<p><strong>Health</strong><br>Under article 2 of the European convention on human rights, the right to life, not only must the state refrain from taking life, but it has a positive obligation to safeguard life. <strong> Postcode rationing</strong> for lifesaving drugs on the NHS, allowing patients in Oxford to have a drug but not in Newcastle upon Tyne, could be challenged under the right to life. Courts will probably still be reluctant to encroach too far on decisions by NHS trusts about allocation of resources, but will have to approach cases differently, giving more weight to the rights of the individual. Trusts will find it difficult to deny a dying person a life saving drug purely on the basis of resources. The convention (article 14) bans discrimination in relation to all the protected rights, such as life, so restricting kidney dialysis to patients of a certain age could come under challenge. </p> <p>Challenges to the <strong> refusal of medical treatment </strong> could also be brought under article 3, the right not to be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment. When the Home Office proposed to deport a convicted drug smuggler with terminal Aids to his own country where no treatment was available, the European court of human rights held this to be a breach of article 3. </p> <p>Withholding of <strong> palliative treatment</strong> could also be challenged. In a judicial review against a London NHS trust which was settled out of court, article 3 was invoked to challenge a refusal to give pain relief to a woman with a severe mental handicap. </p> <p>Lawyers representing claimants suing over road, work or medical <strong> accidents</strong> are expected to use article 8, the right to privacy, to challenge defendants' rights to see all the claimants' medical records, however irrelevant to the claim. </p> <p>The right to infertility treatment is covered by article 12, the right to found a family, but states have a broad discretion as to the rules under which they make it available. If the convention had been incorporated earlier it might have helped Diane Blood, who travelled to Belgium to be impregnated with the sperm of her dead husband. British law prevented her from doing this in the UK because her husband had not given his consent. </p> <p>The <strong> closure of long stay hospitals </strong> and care homes is being challenged as a breach of article 8, the right to respect for family life, home and correspondence. Lawyers argue that closure denies residents respect for their home, an argument which has found favour with English judges. </p> <p>The <strong> mental health</strong> field is expected to be a fruitful one. Government plans to allow people with serious personality disorders to be detained if considered dangerous, even though they have not committed a criminal offence, are likely to be challenged, an appeal court judge predicted last week. Many doctors believe these disorders cannot be treated and the convention probably allows detention only for treatment. </p> <p><strong> Law and order</strong><br> </p> <p>The state has to protect the right to life where it reasonably can. In carrying out their duties to prevent and suppress <strong> crimes of violence </strong> , the police must do \"all that could be reasonably expected of them to avoid a real and immediate risk to life of which they have or ought to have knowledge,\" the Strasbourg court said in the case of Osman v UK. This opened the way for human rights claims where police fail to respond to threats and death or serious injury results. Victim support groups argue that in extreme cases of domestic violence there is a right to life issue and police have a duty to investigate. </p> <p>The <strong> criminal justice system</strong> - from police investigation through prosecution, trial, appeal and prison - is expected to give rise to the most cases. Most will involve article 6, the right to a fair trial. </p> <p>One of the main areas of challenge is expected to be what material the prosecution must disclose to the defence to guarantee a fair trial. When taking decisions on bail, judges must give more weight to the presumption of innocence. Procedures for withholding material from the defence on the grounds of public interest immunity, particularly allowing prosecutors to go before a judge without telling the defence, will need extra safeguards. </p> <p> <strong> Marchers and demonstrators</strong> charged with public order offences are likely to argue that a conviction would breach their right to freedom of expression (article 10) and freedom of assembly (article 11). </p> <p>Police forces which use <strong> stop and search</strong> powers that discriminate against ethnic minorities could be challenged under article 14 (the anti-discrimination article) coupled with article 10 or article 11 (freedom of assembly). The convention does not ban discrimination generally but only discrimination in relation to a right guaranteed by the convention. </p> <p>Article 8, the right to family life, could be invoked if the local authority fails to seek a remedy, such as an anti-social behaviour order, where neighbours create a serious nuisance. Prisons and police may have to tighten up their procedures for preventing cell suicides. The system for dealing with <strong> deaths in custody</strong> and the inquest system in general is likely to come under scrutiny to decide whether it provides a thorough enough investigation to safeguard the right to life. A Strasbourg ruling in a recent French case has established that when an individual is taken into police custody in good health but is injured it is incumbent on the state to give a \"plausible explanation\" of how those injuries occurred. </p> <p>The home secretary has lost his right to decide how long <strong> prisoners serving life</strong> for offences other than murder - discretionary lifers - and juveniles serving life should serve. The Strasbourg court has left him the right to decide on mandatory lifers - those, like Myra Hindley or Rosemary West, serving life for murder. But this could come under challenge again in the English courts. </p> <p><strong> Prisoners</strong> are expected to bring claims on a number of fronts, as they have done in Strasbourg. Different age limits for girl and boy offenders who can be sent to secure training units could be challenged. </p> <p>Laws on drink<strong> drivers</strong> and speed cameras are said by some to be in complete chaos following cases in Birmingham and Scotland where courts held it was a breach of article 6 for suspects to be required to incriminate themselves by admitting they were at the wheel of the car. But the cases could be overturned on appeal. If not, a small amendment to the law could ensure that motoring prosecutions comply with the convention. </p> <p><strong> At work</strong><br> </p> <p> For the first time, there will be a <strong> right of privacy</strong> in English law. </p> <p>Employers snooping on their staff will be prime targets for early test cases. The TUC is highlighting <strong> employer surveillance</strong> as a priority area for cases under the act. Practices likely to come under scrutiny are routine monitoring of staff telephone calls and emails, and CCTV monitoring. Companies and organisations that routinely record calls, such as insurance companies and banks, must ensure that staff are able to make personal calls that are not recorded. </p> <p><strong> Dress codes</strong> may come under fire for breaching freedom of expression, particularly where they discriminate between the sexes. Cases in which employers were held to be justified in imposing a ban on long hair for male but not female staff, and a requirement for female but not male nurses to wear a cap, would probably be decided differently in future. The TUC also hopes to back unions challenging <strong> discrimination against gay and lesbian employees </strong> , which is not currently unlawful. </p> <p>The law on <strong> picketing </strong> , limiting the number of pickets to six at or near the workplace, could be challenged as a breach of freedom of assembly. </p> <p><strong> Family life</strong><br> </p> <p> Fathers frustrated in their attempts to see their children by obstructive former partners are expected to invoke the right to respect for family life. A European court ruling that \"the mutual enjoyment by parent and child of each other's company constitutes a fundamental element of family life\" will help fathers. </p> <p>Greater rights for married than <strong> unmarried fathers</strong> could be considered discriminatory. The Strasbourg court has said that the distinctions are justified but Strasbourg rulings are not precedents like the judgments of UK higher courts, and challenges are possible. </p> <p>The implications of the act for local authorities are far reaching. There will be much more scope to challenge the decisions of social services departments in <strong> childcare</strong> cases. At present if courts think a care plan is unsatisfactory their only choice is to accept it or refuse to make a care order. Under the act they will be able to examine the merits of a social service decision. </p> <p>If local authorities fail to intervene despite clear evidence of serious abuse the court could force it to intervene to spare the child further inhuman and degrading treatment. A case pending in Strasbourg is likely to endorse this. </p> <p>Under English law, the <strong> welfare of the child</strong> is paramount. The convention requires all the parties' rights to be respected and is likely to be invoked in care proceedings and adoption cases to make sure the rights of the natural parents to respect for their family life are adequately considered. The convention will guarantee<strong> parents' rights</strong> to see papers and records when decisions are to be taken on their child's future. </p> <p>People in <strong> same sex relationships </strong> are likely to seek the same rights as heterosexual couples including the right to marry, the tax benefits that go with it, and the right to claim financial support when the relationship breaks down. Same sex couples in Canada have won the same rights as husbands and wives to claim support payments and a share of assets when they split up. </p> <p><strong> Education</strong><br> </p> <p> The right to education is not in the original European convention on human rights, but in article 2 of protocol 1, which was added later. No one can be denied education, but cases at Strasbourg have established that there is no right to a particular type of education, such as education in a single sex or selective school. <strong> Universities </strong> are allowed to restrict entrance to those who can derive benefit from them. </p> <p>Cases have established that the state may take needs and resources into account, and the UK has made a reservation to the right in the protocol. This states that the UK accepts article 2 of the first protocol \"only so far as it is compatible with the provision of efficient instruction and training and the avoidance of unnecessary public expenditure\". So parents wanting provision for their child which involves extra spending by the LEA will find little help. </p> <p>Article 2 says that the state must respect parents' right to ensure teaching \"in conformity with their own religious and philosophical convictions\". But the state is not required to subsidise a particular form of <strong> religious education </strong> , as long as it allows parents to educate their children at home and allows private schools to be established. </p> <p>The right to respect for their convictions does not allow parents to challenge the curriculum. Danish parents who challenged compulsory sex education for children from nine to 11 failed in Strasbourg. </p> <p><strong> School exclusions</strong> are likely to be a fruitful area for challenge. Heads will not be prevented from excluding children but there must be a full and transparent process. Government plans to give a bigger say to heads are certain to be challenged if they go ahead. Under article 14 on non-discrimination, if a disproportionate number of black children are excluded from a single school they may have an argument. </p> <p>A recent House of Lords ruling, following the principles in the Osman decision on police negligence in Strasbourg, allows LEAs to be sued for negligence if they fail to provide effective education for dyslexic children and others with <strong> special needs.</strong> </p> <p><strong> Environment</strong><br> </p> <p> Environmental rights were not on the agenda when the European convention was drafted in the aftermath of the second world war. But cases brought to Strasbourg in the past five years show that environmental concerns are becoming a fertile source of human rights litigation. </p> <p>Incorporation of the convention is expected to lead to claims that public bodies have breached their rights to a safe and clean environment, either directly or by failing to enforce laws against private polluters. Articles 2, 8 and 1 to the first protocol (peaceful enjoyment of possessions) are expected to be cited. <strong> Planning procedures </strong> may also be attacked as breaching article 6, the right to a fair hearing, as has happened in Scotland. </p> <p>However, lawyers predict that many challenges may fail because cases can be brought only by someone who is a \"victim\" of the breach and in other cases public authorities might be able to show that interference with article 8 was justified in terms of the greater good. </p> <p>Article 2 could cover cases where local authorities or other enforcement bodies find evidence of a serious hazard but fail to take effective action or to alert those at risk. The threat of such cases might force authorities to produce more informative environmental data. </p> <p>Claims against public authorities for failing to intervene in <strong> environmental pollution</strong> and nuisance cases might now succeed where they would have failed under English common law because of the difficulty of proving the public authority owed the individual a duty of care. There is no need to prove this under the convention, simply that the right was breached. </p> <p>The Strasbourg court found there was a breach of article 8 and awarded damages against Spain where the authorities failed to tackle the environmental damage caused by a waste treatment plant for tanneries built near the applicant's home. </p> <p><strong> Privacy and free speech</strong><br> </p> <p> Some lawyers predict that this is the area where incorporation of the convention will have its biggest impact. Lord Bingham, now the senior law lord, has argued that the courts could and should develop a right to privacy, now absent from English law, based on the convention. The convention provides for two clashing and competing rights, the right to freedom of expression and the right to respect for private and family life. Strasbourg case law makes it clear that, while privacy is important, freedom of expression is essential to democracy. A safeguard has been written into the Human Rights Act designed to make it harder to obtain <strong> gagging orders</strong> prior to publication. </p> <p>The courts could carve out a right to privacy while protecting the <strong> public's right to know </strong> and the media's right to report on matters of genuine public interest. In future, for example, the courts would protect anyone in the position of Gorden Kaye, the star of 'Allo 'Allo, who was interviewed and photographed by the Sunday Sport in his hospital bed when he was still heavily medicated after an operation. </p> <p>Elements in <strong> libel law </strong> are likely to come under attack, including the onus on defendants in libel actions to \"justify\" factual statements to prove them true. </p> <p>Nigel Wylde, a former Defence Ministry computer consultant, whose trial for breaches of the Official Secrets Act over a book, The Irish War, by Tony Geraghty, starts on November 20, will cite article 10, freedom of expression in his defence. </p> <p>So will the former MI5 agent David Shayler, also facing prosecution for breaches of the Official Secrets Act. </p> <p><strong> Immigration and asylum</strong><br> </p> <p>The convention is likely to be widely invoked by those with <strong> British-born children</strong> facing deportation, who will argue that returning them to their home countries will breach their right to family life. Cherie Booth QC has begin a high court case on behalf of a Ghanaian national convicted of smuggling cocaine who faces deportation, although he has lived in Britain for many years and has a British wife and children. </p> <p>The Strasbourg court has held, however, that immigration procedures do not violate the right to family life if the family can establish itself elsewhere or if claimants have brought it on themselves by flouting immigration controls. Ministers have said they will pay travel costs to ensure family unity outside Britain and will allow families to stay only on compassionate grounds. </p> <p><strong> Main articles incorporated into UK law by the act</strong> </p> <p><strong>Article 2</strong> Right to life </p> <p><strong> Article 3</strong> Prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment </p> <p><strong> Article 4</strong> Prohibition of slavery and enforced labour </p> <p><strong> Article 5</strong> Right to liberty and security </p> <p><strong> Article 6</strong> Right to a fair trial </p> <p><strong> Article 7</strong> No punishment without law </p> <p><strong> Article 8</strong> Right to respect for private and family life </p> <p><strong> Article 9</strong> Freedom of thought, conscience and religion </p> <p><strong> Article 10</strong> Freedom of expression </p> <p><strong> Article 11</strong> Freedom of assembly and association </p> <p><strong> Article 12</strong> Right to marry and found a family </p> <p><strong> Article 14</strong> Prohibition of discrimination (in access to the other rights) </p> <p><strong> Protocol 1, article 1</strong> Right to peaceful enjoyment of possessions </p> <p><strong> Protocol 1, article 2</strong> Right to education </p> <p><strong> Popular misconceptions about the convention</strong> </p> <p><strong> Myth </strong> It is a fevered byproduct of Brussels lawmakers. </p> <p><strong> Fact </strong> The European convention on human rights is a British export, drafted by Home Office civil servants after the second world war for the Council of Europe, which covers 41 member states.

      "bodyText": "Health Under article 2 of the European convention on human rights, the right to life, not only must the state refrain from taking life, but it has a positive obligation to safeguard life. Postcode rationing for lifesaving drugs on the NHS, allowing patients in Oxford to have a drug but not in Newcastle upon Tyne, could be challenged under the right to life. Courts will probably still be reluctant to encroach too far on decisions by NHS trusts about allocation of resources, but will have to approach cases differently, giving more weight to the rights of the individual. Trusts will find it difficult to deny a dying person a life saving drug purely on the basis of resources. The convention (article 14) bans discrimination in relation to all the protected rights, such as life, so restricting kidney dialysis to patients of a certain age could come under challenge. Challenges to the refusal of medical treatment could also be brought under article 3, the right not to be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment. When the Home Office proposed to deport a convicted drug smuggler with terminal Aids to his own country where no treatment was available, the European court of human rights held this to be a breach of article 3. Withholding of palliative treatment could also be challenged. In a judicial review against a London NHS trust which was settled out of court, article 3 was invoked to challenge a refusal to give pain relief to a woman with a severe mental handicap. Lawyers representing claimants suing over road, work or medical accidents are expected to use article 8, the right to privacy, to challenge defendants' rights to see all the claimants' medical records, however irrelevant to the claim. The right to infertility treatment is covered by article 12, the right to found a family, but states have a broad discretion as to the rules under which they make it available. If the convention had been incorporated earlier it might have helped Diane Blood, who travelled to Belgium to be impregnated with the sperm of her dead husband. British law prevented her from doing this in the UK because her husband had not given his consent. The closure of long stay hospitals and care homes is being challenged as a breach of article 8, the right to respect for family life, home and correspondence. Lawyers argue that closure denies residents respect for their home, an argument which has found favour with English judges. The mental health field is expected to be a fruitful one. Government plans to allow people with serious personality disorders to be detained if considered dangerous, even though they have not committed a criminal offence, are likely to be challenged, an appeal court judge predicted last week. Many doctors believe these disorders cannot be treated and the convention probably allows detention only for treatment. Law and order The state has to protect the right to life where it reasonably can. In carrying out their duties to prevent and suppress crimes of violence , the police must do \"all that could be reasonably expected of them to avoid a real and immediate risk to life of which they have or ought to have knowledge,\" the Strasbourg court said in the case of Osman v UK. This opened the way for human rights claims where police fail to respond to threats and death or serious injury results. Victim support groups argue that in extreme cases of domestic violence there is a right to life issue and police have a duty to investigate. The criminal justice system - from police investigation through prosecution, trial, appeal and prison - is expected to give rise to the most cases. Most will involve article 6, the right to a fair trial. One of the main areas of challenge is expected to be what material the prosecution must disclose to the defence to guarantee a fair trial. When taking decisions on bail, judges must give more weight to the presumption of innocence. Procedures for withholding material from the defence on the grounds of public interest immunity, particularly allowing prosecutors to go before a judge without telling the defence, will need extra safeguards. Marchers and demonstrators charged with public order offences are likely to argue that a conviction would breach their right to freedom of expression (article 10) and freedom of assembly (article 11). Police forces which use stop and search powers that discriminate against ethnic minorities could be challenged under article 14 (the anti-discrimination article) coupled with article 10 or article 11 (freedom of assembly). The convention does not ban discrimination generally but only discrimination in relation to a right guaranteed by the convention. Article 8, the right to family life, could be invoked if the local authority fails to seek a remedy, such as an anti-social behaviour order, where neighbours create a serious nuisance. Prisons and police may have to tighten up their procedures for preventing cell suicides. The system for dealing with deaths in custody and the inquest system in general is likely to come under scrutiny to decide whether it provides a thorough enough investigation to safeguard the right to life. A Strasbourg ruling in a recent French case has established that when an individual is taken into police custody in good health but is injured it is incumbent on the state to give a \"plausible explanation\" of how those injuries occurred. The home secretary has lost his right to decide how long prisoners serving life for offences other than murder - discretionary lifers - and juveniles serving life should serve. The Strasbourg court has left him the right to decide on mandatory lifers - those, like Myra Hindley or Rosemary West, serving life for murder. But this could come under challenge again in the English courts. Prisoners are expected to bring claims on a number of fronts, as they have done in Strasbourg. Different age limits for girl and boy offenders who can be sent to secure training units could be challenged. Laws on drink drivers and speed cameras are said by some to be in complete chaos following cases in Birmingham and Scotland where courts held it was a breach of article 6 for suspects to be required to incriminate themselves by admitting they were at the wheel of the car. But the cases could be overturned on appeal. If not, a small amendment to the law could ensure that motoring prosecutions comply with the convention. At work For the first time, there will be a right of privacy in English law. Employers snooping on their staff will be prime targets for early test cases. The TUC is highlighting employer surveillance as a priority area for cases under the act. Practices likely to come under scrutiny are routine monitoring of staff telephone calls and emails, and CCTV monitoring. Companies and organisations that routinely record calls, such as insurance companies and banks, must ensure that staff are able to make personal calls that are not recorded. Dress codes may come under fire for breaching freedom of expression, particularly where they discriminate between the sexes. Cases in which employers were held to be justified in imposing a ban on long hair for male but not female staff, and a requirement for female but not male nurses to wear a cap, would probably be decided differently in future. The TUC also hopes to back unions challenging discrimination against gay and lesbian employees , which is not currently unlawful. The law on picketing , limiting the number of pickets to six at or near the workplace, could be challenged as a breach of freedom of assembly. Family life Fathers frustrated in their attempts to see their children by obstructive former partners are expected to invoke the right to respect for family life. A European court ruling that \"the mutual enjoyment by parent and child of each other's company constitutes a fundamental element of family life\" will help fathers. Greater rights for married than unmarried fathers could be considered discriminatory. The Strasbourg court has said that the distinctions are justified but Strasbourg rulings are not precedents like the judgments of UK higher courts, and challenges are possible. The implications of the act for local authorities are far reaching. There will be much more scope to challenge the decisions of social services departments in childcare cases. At present if courts think a care plan is unsatisfactory their only choice is to accept it or refuse to make a care order. Under the act they will be able to examine the merits of a social service decision. If local authorities fail to intervene despite clear evidence of serious abuse the court could force it to intervene to spare the child further inhuman and degrading treatment. A case pending in Strasbourg is likely to endorse this. Under English law, the welfare of the child is paramount. The convention requires all the parties' rights to be respected and is likely to be invoked in care proceedings and adoption cases to make sure the rights of the natural parents to respect for their family life are adequately considered. The convention will guarantee parents' rights to see papers and records when decisions are to be taken on their child's future. People in same sex relationships are likely to seek the same rights as heterosexual couples including the right to marry, the tax benefits that go with it, and the right to claim financial support when the relationship breaks down. Same sex couples in Canada have won the same rights as husbands and wives to claim support payments and a share of assets when they split up. Education The right to education is not in the original European convention on human rights, but in article 2 of protocol 1, which was added later. No one can be denied education, but cases at Strasbourg have established that there is no right to a particular type of education, such as education in a single sex or selective school. Universities are allowed to restrict entrance to those who can derive benefit from them. Cases have established that the state may take needs and resources into account, and the UK has made a reservation to the right in the protocol. This states that the UK accepts article 2 of the first protocol \"only so far as it is compatible with the provision of efficient instruction and training and the avoidance of unnecessary public expenditure\". So parents wanting provision for their child which involves extra spending by the LEA will find little help. Article 2 says that the state must respect parents' right to ensure teaching \"in conformity with their own religious and philosophical convictions\". But the state is not required to subsidise a particular form of religious education , as long as it allows parents to educate their children at home and allows private schools to be established. The right to respect for their convictions does not allow parents to challenge the curriculum. Danish parents who challenged compulsory sex education for children from nine to 11 failed in Strasbourg. School exclusions are likely to be a fruitful area for challenge. Heads will not be prevented from excluding children but there must be a full and transparent process. Government plans to give a bigger say to heads are certain to be challenged if they go ahead. Under article 14 on non-discrimination, if a disproportionate number of black children are excluded from a single school they may have an argument. A recent House of Lords ruling, following the principles in the Osman decision on police negligence in Strasbourg, allows LEAs to be sued for negligence if they fail to provide effective education for dyslexic children and others with special needs. Environment Environmental rights were not on the agenda when the European convention was drafted in the aftermath of the second world war. But cases brought to Strasbourg in the past five years show that environmental concerns are becoming a fertile source of human rights litigation. Incorporation of the convention is expected to lead to claims that public bodies have breached their rights to a safe and clean environment, either directly or by failing to enforce laws against private polluters. Articles 2, 8 and 1 to the first protocol (peaceful enjoyment of possessions) are expected to be cited. Planning procedures may also be attacked as breaching article 6, the right to a fair hearing, as has happened in Scotland. However, lawyers predict that many challenges may fail because cases can be brought only by someone who is a \"victim\" of the breach and in other cases public authorities might be able to show that interference with article 8 was justified in terms of the greater good. Article 2 could cover cases where local authorities or other enforcement bodies find evidence of a serious hazard but fail to take effective action or to alert those at risk. The threat of such cases might force authorities to produce more informative environmental data. Claims against public authorities for failing to intervene in environmental pollution and nuisance cases might now succeed where they would have failed under English common law because of the difficulty of proving the public authority owed the individual a duty of care. There is no need to prove this under the convention, simply that the right was breached. The Strasbourg court found there was a breach of article 8 and awarded damages against Spain where the authorities failed to tackle the environmental damage caused by a waste treatment plant for tanneries built near the applicant's home. Privacy and free speech Some lawyers predict that this is the area where incorporation of the convention will have its biggest impact. Lord Bingham, now the senior law lord, has argued that the courts could and should develop a right to privacy, now absent from English law, based on the convention. The convention provides for two clashing and competing rights, the right to freedom of expression and the right to respect for private and family life. Strasbourg case law makes it clear that, while privacy is important, freedom of expression is essential to democracy. A safeguard has been written into the Human Rights Act designed to make it harder to obtain gagging orders prior to publication. The courts could carve out a right to privacy while protecting the public's right to know and the media's right to report on matters of genuine public interest. In future, for example, the courts would protect anyone in the position of Gorden Kaye, the star of 'Allo 'Allo, who was interviewed and photographed by the Sunday Sport in his hospital bed when he was still heavily medicated after an operation. Elements in libel law are likely to come under attack, including the onus on defendants in libel actions to \"justify\" factual statements to prove them true. Nigel Wylde, a former Defence Ministry computer consultant, whose trial for breaches of the Official Secrets Act over a book, The Irish War, by Tony Geraghty, starts on November 20, will cite article 10, freedom of expression in his defence. So will the former MI5 agent David Shayler, also facing prosecution for breaches of the Official Secrets Act. Immigration and asylum The convention is likely to be widely invoked by those with British-born children facing deportation, who will argue that returning them to their home countries will breach their right to family life. Cherie Booth QC has begin a high court case on behalf of a Ghanaian national convicted of smuggling cocaine who faces deportation, although he has lived in Britain for many years and has a British wife and children.

      "body": "<p>Global warming in the Arctic may have finally achieved something that generations of explorers from Tudor times to the present day failed to accomplish - the opening up one of the world's most fabled trade routes to international commerce. </p> <p>Sixty years ago, the St Roch, a ship belonging to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) battled its way through the pack ice of two winters at the top of the world to complete the first west to east journey through the North-west Passage after 27 months at sea. </p> <p>This year, another RCMP ship, named the St Roch II in honour of its 1940 predecessor, completed the same voyage from the Pacific to the Atlantic in just over a month, finally emerging into Baffin Bay, west of Greenland, last week. </p> <p>At no point in its journey across the Arctic ocean north of Canada did the St Roch II encounter any of the pack ice which defeated so many of its predecessors in the search for a westerly sea route from Europe to the Pacific Spice Islands. </p> <p>\"Concern should be registered with the fact that we didn't see any ice,\" the vessel's skipper Sgt Ken Burton reported last week. \"There were some bergs, but nothing to cause any anxiety. We saw some ribbons of multi-year ice floes, all small and fragmented, and we were able to steer around them.\" </p> <p>As so often, though, one man's environmental concern is another's financial opportunity. The success of the St Roch II's summer crossing opens up the possibility that commercial shipping may eventually begin to use the route - shortening the journey between Europe and Asia by around 5,000 miles and sharply reducing competitive costs. </p> <p>\"It is still a risky venture, but the day of the famed North-west Passage, the shortcut to the Orient, may be just around the corner,\" Sgt Burton said. </p> <p>That possibility has raised fears among conservationists that the regular use of the Arctic ocean by large commercial ships could cause some of the environmental damage that has already been done to Alaskan waters and coastlines by increased shipping, including cruise ships. </p> <p>At least two other ships apart from the St Roch II have cruised in the Northwest Passage this summer, one from the United States and the other from New Zealand.

      "bodyText": "Global warming in the Arctic may have finally achieved something that generations of explorers from Tudor times to the present day failed to accomplish - the opening up one of the world's most fabled trade routes to international commerce. Sixty years ago, the St Roch, a ship belonging to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) battled its way through the pack ice of two winters at the top of the world to complete the first west to east journey through the North-west Passage after 27 months at sea. This year, another RCMP ship, named the St Roch II in honour of its 1940 predecessor, completed the same voyage from the Pacific to the Atlantic in just over a month, finally emerging into Baffin Bay, west of Greenland, last week. At no point in its journey across the Arctic ocean north of Canada did the St Roch II encounter any of the pack ice which defeated so many of its predecessors in the search for a westerly sea route from Europe to the Pacific Spice Islands. \"Concern should be registered with the fact that we didn't see any ice,\" the vessel's skipper Sgt Ken Burton reported last week. \"There were some bergs, but nothing to cause any anxiety. We saw some ribbons of multi-year ice floes, all small and fragmented, and we were able to steer around them.\" As so often, though, one man's environmental concern is another's financial opportunity. The success of the St Roch II's summer crossing opens up the possibility that commercial shipping may eventually begin to use the route - shortening the journey between Europe and Asia by around 5,000 miles and sharply reducing competitive costs. \"It is still a risky venture, but the day of the famed North-west Passage, the shortcut to the Orient, may be just around the corner,\" Sgt Burton said. That possibility has raised fears among conservationists that the regular use of the Arctic ocean by large commercial ships could cause some of the environmental damage that has already been done to Alaskan waters and coastlines by increased shipping, including cruise ships. At least two other ships apart from the St Roch II have cruised in the Northwest Passage this summer, one from the United States and the other from New Zealand. The growth of maritime traffic this year is a sign of things to come, the conservationists believe. Environmental fears The St Roch II's voyage is another dramatic sign that the temperature of the Arctic ocean could be rising to a point at which existing assumptions about the once Frozen North may need to be rethought - though the causes of the change are still fiercely debated. Comparison of submarine sonar probes beneath the Arctic ice suggest that the thickness of the polar cap is now less than 60% of what it was less than half a century ago. Satellite photographs show that the size of the Arctic ice cap in the midsummer months is now some 6% smaller than it was in 1980. Last month it was reported that clear water had been found at the North Pole, though subsequent reports have called into question whether this was as unique as it was first claimed. \"We don't know enough about the Arctic to know if this is global warming, climate change, or maybe we were just plain lucky,\" Sgt Burton said. The St Roch II left Vancouver on July 1 on its journey around the north of the North American land mass, aiming to reach Halifax, Nova Scotia, by October 10, before sailing on to New York. Its voyage through the normally frozen area from Tuktoyaktuk near the Alaskan border to Baffin Bay could have been accomplished even more quickly had it not been for a number of land visits which the St Roch II made to isolated outposts along the route. For more than 500 years, sailors have tried to find a western sea route linking Europe with China and Japan. From John Cabot in the 1490s, to Martin Frobisher in the 1570s, to Roald Amundsen in the early 1900s, some of the most famous explorers in history have struggled to find the elusive North-west Passage.

Earlier this week Wee Smithy apparently ordered a cab from home to the press launch for Channel 5's fab new voyeur TV-fest, Jailbreak. After the cab showed up outside her abode, Smith gathered her things and headed out the door, only to be met by the sight of the cabbie - a woman - squatting to relieve herself in the front garden.

Why the band couldn't find a record label to provide the required funding is something of a mystery, but, undeterred by this apparent lack of faith, Marillion decided to email its 30,000 fan base asking for money with the threat that if it didn't get the money it wouldn't reward its steadfast fans with more fine melodies. How much did they raise? Get this - a whopping \u00a350,000. Of course the fans haven't just given the band the money, they've effectively bought the CD in advance. Clearly they were so blinded by Marillion's music that they've entrusted the band not to produce a pile of shite. Could Marillion have hit onto something? Perhaps if other bands followed Marillion's lead we could see the return of such fine acts as America teen sensation Tiffany.</p> <p><strong>Second Tuesday</strong><br>There's nothing like being an out-and-out copycat is there? You may recall the reason why First Tuesday is so called is because it holds events on the First Tuesday of every month. It's called stating the obvious because it's true, us internet types aren't that bright. Other networking groups have been a little more inventive - The Chemistry, The Ecademy and The Glasshouse for example - but none have been quite so bold as to pinch First Tuesday's inspirational idea, as First Monday, one of those it does-exactly-what-it-says-on-the-tin type of events - and absolutely nothing to do with First Tuesday. And it doesn't look like stopping there - a quick skinny though Net Names and it turns out that all variations of First and a day of the week have already been registered. Prepare to be inundated. </p> <p> <strong>Top banana</strong><br>A free banana to the correspondent from Wardour Street who's come up with the first response to Media Monkey's call for Big Brother tie-in ideas. Big Brother-branded prozac \"for when you know they're watching you\" we like; but the suggestion involving nipple cams is just not appropriate for a family-oriented diary column.</p> <p><strong>Bunch of Arse</strong><br>Always up for a good old crusade against hypocrisy, Media Monkey is indebted to the TV type who pointed out some shocking inconsistencies in Granada Media's net-busting deal to buy a piece of the famous Arse. After all, is this not the same Granada Media that was just recently arguing for the Carlton/United merger to be red-carded because it would cause a deplorable widening of the north-south media divide? Surely, following this logic, if Charlie Allen's Weatherfield Rovers mob are so committed to the north, they should be putting their wonga into say, Accrington Stanley, or Bradford Park Avenue? </p> <p><strong>What an offer, Hezza</strong><br> Michael Heseltine's generous offer to sell his book to staff at the knock-down price of \u00a310 has apparently met with a terrific response. So much so that Hezza has promised to sign every one personally. \"His generosity exceeds our wildest expectations,\" said a Haymarket source. </p> <p><strong>Jungle fever?</strong> <br> A memo went round Haymarket Publishing's offices today with the following unmissable offer for all Michael Heseltine's minions: \"Haymarket has a quantity of Michael Heseltine's book, \"Life in the Jungle\", published today, at the special price of \u00a310.\" The lines to Hezza's office must be jammed. <br></p> <p><strong>Wise words</strong> <br> Andrew Neil, speaking at the recent People and Profits in the New Economy conference: \"If you have trouble with recruitment and retention, then your company sucks.\" Could that be the same Andrew Neil who has recently had quite a lot of trouble with staff retention at the Scotsman? Your words, Andrew, not ours. <br></p> <p><strong>Mo better box</strong> <br> Word that retiring Labour MP St Mo of Mowlam is considering a TV career has got Media Monkey flicking through its contacts book in search of old broadcasting muckers who may be able to help out. The first call will undoubtedly be to the ITV Network Centre, where they are still a chief executive short of a full ITV Council. St Mo would be the ideal candidate - after all, she has plenty of experience of a job where people are always knifing you in the back. But Media Monkey would welcome other suggestions...</p> <p><strong>\"Nasty\" Nick snapped</strong> <br> Media Monkey is certain the Sun, as the official Big Brother newspaper, will be gagging to get its hands on some photos reportedly doing the rounds, which show \"Nasty\" Nick Bateman in his first public clinch with a member of the opposite sex since being evicted from the house of two-way mirrors. The offending snaps, taken outside the Met Bar after the TV Quick awards on Tuesday night (September 4), are said to feature Nick in a warm embrace with, er... go-getting Sun TV reporter Emily Smith. All in the line of duty, no doubt.</p> <p><strong>Sky's the limit</strong> <br> Does the low cunning of the BSkyB marketing department know no bounds? Imagine little Johnnie and Jemima's delight when, after a spot of bulletin reading courtesy of Sky News during their visit to the Millennium Dome, they are given a videotape of the performance to take home and treasure. Imagine their disappointment when, on getting home and watching the video, they have to sit through several minutes of trailers for Sky TV services before glimpsing their brief moment of fame. Fiendishly clever. </p> <p><strong>A few Choice words</strong> <br> The dirtiest catfight in telly, Terry Wogan v Stuart Murphy, splutters on in the letters column of BBC in-house organ Ariel. You may recall that in a letter to Ariel last week, BBC Choice head honcho Murphy launched a stout defence of the BBC following La Wogan's recent attack on the corporation, telling him he was \"living in a bizarre fantasy world of an Auntie's Bloomers script\". This week in Ariel, BBC broadcasting and presentation staffers Mark Thomas and Christina Dunley leapt to Wogan's defence, accusing Murphy of \"wanting us to work for a Stalinist BBC where employees dare not utter any criticism of their masters\". The pair conclude: \"Let's face it Stuart, Choice has never delivered on the promise of its name... the sooner BBC3 rises from its ashes the better.\" Miaow!</p> <p><strong>Don't talk at Talk</strong><br> The queen of New York publishing, Tina Brown, is giving Brits abroad a bad name. Staff members at Talk magazine have been told not to approach Ms Brown directly with ideas or questions, as their input is \"driving her crazy\". New York magazine reports gleefully that the new rule is that editorial director [Bob Wallace] or his direct underling [Perry van der Meer] must filter Tina's traffic. Wallace disputes the account, saying that while Van der Meer -- who worked under Brown at The New Yorker -- was brought in recently to streamline the editorial process, \"anyone can still come to Tina and me or e-mail us at any time about any issue. And believe me, they do.\" The New York Times' source notes sorrowfully: \"No one wants to hear that they're driving their boss crazy.\" Ms Brown is in England on holiday.</p> <p><strong>Croaky name?</strong><br> It's official: advertising agency names are getting sillier. First there was Mother - the trendy, Clerkenwell-based agency that looks after Harvey Nichols and Hoegaarden Beer. Then the disgraced political lobbyist Derek Draper launched an ad agency and mysteriously decided to call it Farm. Now Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse - a company that's surely old enough to know better - has appointed an agency called Strawberry Frog to handle its ads. It makes you long for the good old days, when adland was full of egotists who called their agencies after themselves, and had done with it.</p> <p><strong>A little unfortunate</strong><br> Marks &amp; Spencer has been trying to do its bit for normal women by using unusually curvaceous models (to put it politely) in its new ad campaign. So it was unfortunate that only the day before the distinctly uncurvy Tara Palmer-Tomkinson appeared on the front page of the Daily Mail as the new face of Splendour.com - a lingerie-selling website in which M&amp;S has a stake. A small case of double standards, perhaps?</p> <p><strong>No small beer</strong><br> Far be it from us to suggest that anyone in advertising takes the whole business of making ads too seriously. But the reaction of Heineken international marketing manager Frazer Thompson to the French ban on alcohol ads may have been a little extreme. \"In France the world has gone dark,\" said a grief-stricken Thompson. </p> <p><strong>Toilet watch</strong><br> News that Channel 4 is planning to bring out a Big Brother jigsaw in time for Christmas has inspired Media Monkey to ponder what other sensational TV tie-ins broadcasters may have up their sleeves. We'll start the ball rolling with the mouth-watering prospect of Channel 4 linking up with Armitage Shanks and Triton to bring out Big Brother-branded toilets and showers with built-in CCTV cameras. Other suggestions welcome.</p> <p> Email the Media Monkey at <a href=\"mailto:monkey@mediatheguardian.com\">Monkey@mediatheguardian.com</a></p>",

A memo went round Haymarket Publishing's offices today with the following unmissable offer for all Michael Heseltine's minions: \"Haymarket has a quantity of Michael Heseltine's book, \"Life in the Jungle\", published today, at the special price of \u00a310.\" The lines to Hezza's office must be jammed. Wise words Andrew Neil, speaking at the recent People and Profits in the New Economy conference: \"If you have trouble with recruitment and retention, then your company sucks.\" Could that be the same Andrew Neil who has recently had quite a lot of trouble with staff retention at the Scotsman? Your words, Andrew, not ours. Mo better box Word that retiring Labour MP St Mo of Mowlam is considering a TV career has got Media Monkey flicking through its contacts book in search of old broadcasting muckers who may be able to help out. The first call will undoubtedly be to the ITV Network Centre, where they are still a chief executive short of a full ITV Council. St Mo would be the ideal candidate - after all, she has plenty of experience of a job where people are always knifing you in the back. But Media Monkey would welcome other suggestions... \"Nasty\" Nick snapped Media Monkey is certain the Sun, as the official Big Brother newspaper, will be gagging to get its hands on some photos reportedly doing the rounds, which show \"Nasty\" Nick Bateman in his first public clinch with a member of the opposite sex since being evicted from the house of two-way mirrors. The offending snaps, taken outside the Met Bar after the TV Quick awards on Tuesday night (September 4), are said to feature Nick in a warm embrace with, er... go-getting Sun TV reporter Emily Smith. All in the line of duty, no doubt. Sky's the limit Does the low cunning of the BSkyB marketing department know no bounds? Imagine little Johnnie and Jemima's delight when, after a spot of bulletin reading courtesy of Sky News during their visit to the Millennium Dome, they are given a videotape of the performance to take home and treasure. Imagine their disappointment when, on getting home and watching the video, they have to sit through several minutes of trailers for Sky TV services before glimpsing their brief moment of fame. Fiendishly clever. A few Choice words The dirtiest catfight in telly, Terry Wogan v Stuart Murphy, splutters on in the letters column of BBC in-house organ Ariel. You may recall that in a letter to Ariel last week, BBC Choice head honcho Murphy launched a stout defence of the BBC following La Wogan's recent attack on the corporation, telling him he was \"living in a bizarre fantasy world of an Auntie's Bloomers script\". This week in Ariel, BBC broadcasting and presentation staffers Mark Thomas and Christina Dunley leapt to Wogan's defence, accusing Murphy of \"wanting us to work for a Stalinist BBC where employees dare not utter any criticism of their masters\". The pair conclude: \"Let's face it Stuart, Choice has never delivered on the promise of its name... the sooner BBC3 rises from its ashes the better.\" Miaow! Don't talk at Talk The queen of New York publishing, Tina Brown, is giving Brits abroad a bad name. Staff members at Talk magazine have been told not to approach Ms Brown directly with ideas or questions, as their input is \"driving her crazy\". New York magazine reports gleefully that the new rule is that editorial director [Bob Wallace] or his direct underling [Perry van der Meer] must filter Tina's traffic. Wallace disputes the account, saying that while Van der Meer -- who worked under Brown at The New Yorker -- was brought in recently to streamline the editorial process, \"anyone can still come to Tina and me or e-mail us at any time about any issue. And believe me, they do.\" The New York Times' source notes sorrowfully: \"No one wants to hear that they're driving their boss crazy.\" Ms Brown is in England on holiday. Croaky name? It's official: advertising agency names are getting sillier. First there was Mother - the trendy, Clerkenwell-based agency that looks after Harvey Nichols and Hoegaarden Beer. Then the disgraced political lobbyist Derek Draper launched an ad agency and mysteriously decided to call it Farm. Now Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse - a company that's surely old enough to know better - has appointed an agency called Strawberry Frog to handle its ads. It makes you long for the good old days, when adland was full of egotists who called their agencies after themselves, and had done with it. A little unfortunate Marks &amp; Spencer has been trying to do its bit for normal women by using unusually curvaceous models (to put it politely) in its new ad campaign. So it was unfortunate that only the day before the distinctly uncurvy Tara Palmer-Tomkinson appeared on the front page of the Daily Mail as the new face of Splendour.com - a lingerie-selling website in which M&amp;S has a stake. A small case of double standards, perhaps? No small beer Far be it from us to suggest that anyone in advertising takes the whole business of making ads too seriously. But the reaction of Heineken international marketing manager Frazer Thompson to the French ban on alcohol ads may have been a little extreme. \"In France the world has gone dark,\" said a grief-stricken Thompson. Toilet watch News that Channel 4 is planning to bring out a Big Brother jigsaw in time for Christmas has inspired Media Monkey to ponder what other sensational TV tie-ins broadcasters may have up their sleeves. We'll start the ball rolling with the mouth-watering prospect of Channel 4 linking up with Armitage Shanks and Triton to bring out Big Brother-branded toilets and showers with built-in CCTV cameras. Other suggestions welcome. Email the Media Monkey at Monkey@mediatheguardian.com",

      "trailText": "<p>For sale: academic integrity.  In the second extract from his new book,  George Monbiot  describes how our ivory towers of learning were taken over by industry</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>For most of the 20th century, scientists in British universities were discouraged from engaging with industry, for fear that such contact would persuade them to concentrate on immediate technological needs rather than on the more profound scientific questions. Today, by contrast, contact between government-funded researchers and industry is, in effect, compulsory in many departments. The result is that there is scarcely a university in the UK whose academic freedom has not been compromised by its funding arrangements. </p> <p>Business now inhabits the cloisters of even the biggest and richest institutions. Cambridge University, for example, possesses a Shell chair in chemical engineering, BP professorships in organic chemistry and petroleum science, an ICI chair in applied thermodynamics, a Glaxo chair of molecular parasitology, a Unilever chair of molecular science, a Price Waterhouse chair of financial accounting and a Marks &amp; Spencer chair of farm animal health and food Science. Rolls-Royce, AT&amp;T, Microsoft and the biotechnology company Zeneca have all set up laboratories in the university. </p> <p>In June 1999, BP gave the university \u00a325m to fund work across five departments. In November 1999, Cambridge set up an \u00a384m joint venture, funded largely by the British government, partly by industry, with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Its purpose is to \"change the face of business and wealth creation in the UK\" by stimulating \"research spin-offs\" and \"training the business leaders of the future\". Cambridge's vice chancellor explained: \"We may once have been thought of as an ivory tower - today we are a tower of high technology and business prowess.\" </p> <p>Oxford University has accepted \u00a320m from Wafic Said to build a business school which will bear his name. Said was named in the Commons inquiry into the sale of a \"supergun\" to Iraq, as the agent responsible for brokering Britain's \u00a320bn arms deal with Saudi Arabia. In 1998, he reached a \u00a32m settlement with the Inland Revenue after investigators found that his companies had not paid the necessary British taxes. Lord Jenkins, the chancellor of the university, announced that the gift would place Said among those \"to whom Oxford has given immortality\". The university has allowed Rupert Murdoch, a man whose contribution to the language has been, shall we say, resourceful, to endow a chair in English and a visiting professorship in the broadcast media. The first beneficiary of the professorship is David Elstein, who used to run Murdoch's channel Sky One. </p> <p>I have been unable to find a university anywhere in the UK which does not accept corporate money for research in which the companies involved have an immediate interest. The independent researchers Greg Muttitt and Chris Grimshaw have examined the influence of oil companies on British universities. They identified nearly 1,000 research projects being conducted for oil and gas firms. Some university faculties, they discovered, have become largely dependent upon industrial money. Aberdeen's geology department, for example, boasts that \"Industrial contracts and sponsorship now account for more than two-thirds of our research income, support over one-third of our lecturing staff, fund nearly all our postgraduates, and even provide appropriate components of our undergraduate training.\" </p> <p>There are BP professorships, fellowships or lectureships at seven British universities, including both Oxford and Cambridge. A director of BP sits on the Council for Science and Technology. Until the end of 1998, the director general of the UK's Research Councils was Sir John Cadogan, formerly BP's research director. The chairman and chief executive of Esso UK sits on the Higher Education Funding Council for England. Lord Oxburgh, the rector of Imperial College, is a director of Shell. </p> <p>The result of such corporate involvement, the researchers found, was a significant distortion of the research agenda. Five times as much money is spent in British universities on research into oil and gas as on research into renewable sources of energy, even though renewable energy, which is an emerging industry, requires a great deal of research as it approaches its take-off phase, while oil and gas extraction, a mature industry, could be expected to need far less. </p> <p>But while the acceptance of corporate money might encourage researchers to change the way they view the world, the acceptance of public money is now scarcely less hazardous. The main source of funds for biologists working in Britain's universities is the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), a government body with an annual budget of \u00a3190m. Its chairman is Peter Doyle, formerly an executive director of the biotechnology company Zeneca. Among the members of its council are the chief executive of the pharmaceutical firm Chiroscience; the former director of research and development at the controversial food company Nestl\u00e9; the president of the Food and Drink Federation; a consultant to the biochemical industry; and the general manager of Britain's biggest farming business. The BBSRC's strategy board contains executives from SmithKline Beecham, Merck Sharpe &amp; Dohme and AgrEvo UK. </p> <p>The research council has seven specialist committees, each overseeing the dispersal of money to different branches of biology. Employees of Zeneca, according to the council's website, sit on all of them. When the BBSRC was established in 1994, it took over the biological funding programme previously run by the Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC). SERC's purpose was to advance knowledge of all kinds, whether or not it had an immediate commercial application. The BBSRC's purpose, it maintains, \"is to sustain a broad base of interdisciplinary research and training to help industry, commerce and government create wealth and improve the quality of life\". </p> <p>As well as diverting large sums of public money which would once have been spent on blue-sky biological research into genetic engineering, the BBSRC also funds the secondment of academics into corporations. Such schemes, the council enthuses, help \"companies establish long-lasting personal and corporate linkages with academics/higher education institutions\" and to \"influence basic research relevant to company objectives\". The council has launched a Biotechnology Young Entrepreneurs Scheme, \"aimed at encouraging a more entrepreneurial attitude in bioscientists\". It has paid for researchers to work for Nestl\u00e9, Unilever, Glaxo Wellcome, SmithKline Beecham, AgrEvo, DuPont, Rhone-Poulenc and, of course, Zeneca. </p> <p>More disturbing than the activi ties of the research councils, however, are the priorities of the parliamentary office of science and technology's 16 foresight panels. The foresight panels scarcely pretend to promote either academic objectivity or the wider public interest. Though they are official sources of scientific advice to both central government and to the research councils, they are largely controlled not by scientists but by business people. The food and drink foresight panel, for example, is composed of eight representatives of food companies and trade bodies, and three members of university departments, as well as members of the BBSRC and the Medical Research Council, who are expected to respond to its demands. It has several subcommittees, whose purpose is to identify \"research priorities\". One is called the alcoholic drinks panel. The report it produced was drawn up in consultation with five trade associations, three industry- sponsored research institutes, 15 drinks companies and no one else. Its report called for \"a sophisticated understanding of individuals' eating and drinking behaviour\" to assist \"product development\". </p> <p>The report of the fruit and vegetables subcommittee suggested that \"Irradiation may be re-examined for extending shelf life.\" The dairy subcommittee concluded that \"More effort should be put into publicising the health benefits of milk in the human diet.\" The meat subcommittee complained that \"criticisms of meat production from an animal-welfare and environmental-impact perspective, and of high levels of red meat consumption as potentially damaging to human health, gained credence from some scientific work\". It called for research into \"manipulation of the immune system\" and the \"application of physical or chemical treatments of carcasses\". \"Concern that the outcome may not be acceptable in the current climate,\" it asserted, \"should not... hold back the related basic research.\" </p> <p>Until the day before he became minister for science and technology in July 1998, Lord Sainsbury chaired another subcommittee, the food chain group. His report, published like all the others by the government's Department of Trade and Industry, expressed the hope that in the future, \"the expensive precautionary principle is abandoned\". (The precautionary principle declares that if there is scientific doubt about the safety of a product or practice, it should not be deployed until that doubt has been dispelled.) \"The most progressive farms,\" the report suggested, would be those on which \"herbicides are applied by robots under the management of satellites.\" </p> <p>Sainsbury and John Battle, then a minister at the DTI, attended a food chain group summit in March 1998 which concluded that this government-funded research programme should involve \"influencing and anticipating future behaviour of consumers\". Summing up, Sainsbury told the delegates: \"It is important for food chain companies to establish better contact with scientists and the people that provide public funds for research. OST [the office of science and technology] and MAFF [the Ministry of Agriculture] can help you make contact with the right people.\" </p> <p>Lord Sainsbury's former interests continue to feature prominently in the department he runs. He presents the prizes to the winners of his ministry's bioscience business plan competition, which is sponsored by Glaxo Wellcome and the Gatsby Charitable Foundation, the science-funding body he established before he became a minister. The chairman of the Institute of Arable Crops Research, appointed by the BBSRC, was previously chairman of the Sainsbury laboratory. An employee of J Sainsbury plc sits on the food and drink foresight panel. </p> <p>At the end of 1998, as public concern about the government's science policies began to emerge, Sainsbury announced a \"nationwide consultation\" to \"explore the wider implications of scientific progress\". He explained that \"Our long-term aim is to build public confidence in the government's use of scientific information.\" The consultation was designed by an advisory group of six people. One of the members of the group was, of course, a senior manager at Zeneca. Another was an employee of J Sainsbury plc. </p> <p>As big business infiltrates the research agenda, ever wider zones of inquiry are placed off-limits. Some of the key questions are left for amateurs and voluntary organisations to investigate. Friends of the Earth and Newsnight studied the pollen flow from the government's test sites for genetically modified crops, for example, only because government researchers were not examining the issue. It was a retired GP, Dr Dick van Steenis, who discovered that the number of primary schoolchildren using asthma inhalers was directly proportionate to the levels of pollution to which they were exposed. </p> <p>Science tells us who we are and how we can live better. It is the glass through which we perceive the world. If distorted, it twists our understanding of the ways in which we might progress, of the alternatives to existing models of development. When our universities are offered for sale, objectivity and intellectual honesty become surplus to requirements.</p> <p>\u0095 This is an edited extract from The Captive State: The Corporate Takeover of Britain by George Monbiot (Macmillan, \u00a312.99).</p>",

      "bodyText": "For most of the 20th century, scientists in British universities were discouraged from engaging with industry, for fear that such contact would persuade them to concentrate on immediate technological needs rather than on the more profound scientific questions. Today, by contrast, contact between government-funded researchers and industry is, in effect, compulsory in many departments. The result is that there is scarcely a university in the UK whose academic freedom has not been compromised by its funding arrangements. Business now inhabits the cloisters of even the biggest and richest institutions. Cambridge University, for example, possesses a Shell chair in chemical engineering, BP professorships in organic chemistry and petroleum science, an ICI chair in applied thermodynamics, a Glaxo chair of molecular parasitology, a Unilever chair of molecular science, a Price Waterhouse chair of financial accounting and a Marks &amp; Spencer chair of farm animal health and food Science. Rolls-Royce, AT&amp;T, Microsoft and the biotechnology company Zeneca have all set up laboratories in the university. In June 1999, BP gave the university \u00a325m to fund work across five departments. In November 1999, Cambridge set up an \u00a384m joint venture, funded largely by the British government, partly by industry, with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Its purpose is to \"change the face of business and wealth creation in the UK\" by stimulating \"research spin-offs\" and \"training the business leaders of the future\". Cambridge's vice chancellor explained: \"We may once have been thought of as an ivory tower - today we are a tower of high technology and business prowess.\" Oxford University has accepted \u00a320m from Wafic Said to build a business school which will bear his name. Said was named in the Commons inquiry into the sale of a \"supergun\" to Iraq, as the agent responsible for brokering Britain's \u00a320bn arms deal with Saudi Arabia. In 1998, he reached a \u00a32m settlement with the Inland Revenue after investigators found that his companies had not paid the necessary British taxes. Lord Jenkins, the chancellor of the university, announced that the gift would place Said among those \"to whom Oxford has given immortality\". The university has allowed Rupert Murdoch, a man whose contribution to the language has been, shall we say, resourceful, to endow a chair in English and a visiting professorship in the broadcast media. The first beneficiary of the professorship is David Elstein, who used to run Murdoch's channel Sky One. I have been unable to find a university anywhere in the UK which does not accept corporate money for research in which the companies involved have an immediate interest. The independent researchers Greg Muttitt and Chris Grimshaw have examined the influence of oil companies on British universities. They identified nearly 1,000 research projects being conducted for oil and gas firms. Some university faculties, they discovered, have become largely dependent upon industrial money. Aberdeen's geology department, for example, boasts that \"Industrial contracts and sponsorship now account for more than two-thirds of our research income, support over one-third of our lecturing staff, fund nearly all our postgraduates, and even provide appropriate components of our undergraduate training.\" There are BP professorships, fellowships or lectureships at seven British universities, including both Oxford and Cambridge. A director of BP sits on the Council for Science and Technology. Until the end of 1998, the director general of the UK's Research Councils was Sir John Cadogan, formerly BP's research director. The chairman and chief executive of Esso UK sits on the Higher Education Funding Council for England. Lord Oxburgh, the rector of Imperial College, is a director of Shell. The result of such corporate involvement, the researchers found, was a significant distortion of the research agenda. Five times as much money is spent in British universities on research into oil and gas as on research into renewable sources of energy, even though renewable energy, which is an emerging industry, requires a great deal of research as it approaches its take-off phase, while oil and gas extraction, a mature industry, could be expected to need far less. But while the acceptance of corporate money might encourage researchers to change the way they view the world, the acceptance of public money is now scarcely less hazardous. The main source of funds for biologists working in Britain's universities is the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), a government body with an annual budget of \u00a3190m. Its chairman is Peter Doyle, formerly an executive director of the biotechnology company Zeneca. Among the members of its council are the chief executive of the pharmaceutical firm Chiroscience; the former director of research and development at the controversial food company Nestl\u00e9; the president of the Food and Drink Federation; a consultant to the biochemical industry; and the general manager of Britain's biggest farming business. The BBSRC's strategy board contains executives from SmithKline Beecham, Merck Sharpe &amp; Dohme and AgrEvo UK. The research council has seven specialist committees, each overseeing the dispersal of money to different branches of biology. Employees of Zeneca, according to the council's website, sit on all of them. When the BBSRC was established in 1994, it took over the biological funding programme previously run by the Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC). SERC's purpose was to advance knowledge of all kinds, whether or not it had an immediate commercial application. The BBSRC's purpose, it maintains, \"is to sustain a broad base of interdisciplinary research and training to help industry, commerce and government create wealth and improve the quality of life\". As well as diverting large sums of public money which would once have been spent on blue-sky biological research into genetic engineering, the BBSRC also funds the secondment of academics into corporations. Such schemes, the council enthuses, help \"companies establish long-lasting personal and corporate linkages with academics/higher education institutions\" and to \"influence basic research relevant to company objectives\". The council has launched a Biotechnology Young Entrepreneurs Scheme, \"aimed at encouraging a more entrepreneurial attitude in bioscientists\". It has paid for researchers to work for Nestl\u00e9, Unilever, Glaxo Wellcome, SmithKline Beecham, AgrEvo, DuPont, Rhone-Poulenc and, of course, Zeneca. More disturbing than the activi ties of the research councils, however, are the priorities of the parliamentary office of science and technology's 16 foresight panels. The foresight panels scarcely pretend to promote either academic objectivity or the wider public interest. Though they are official sources of scientific advice to both central government and to the research councils, they are largely controlled not by scientists but by business people. The food and drink foresight panel, for example, is composed of eight representatives of food companies and trade bodies, and three members of university departments, as well as members of the BBSRC and the Medical Research Council, who are expected to respond to its demands. It has several subcommittees, whose purpose is to identify \"research priorities\". One is called the alcoholic drinks panel. The report it produced was drawn up in consultation with five trade associations, three industry- sponsored research institutes, 15 drinks companies and no one else. Its report called for \"a sophisticated understanding of individuals' eating and drinking behaviour\" to assist \"product development\". The report of the fruit and vegetables subcommittee suggested that \"Irradiation may be re-examined for extending shelf life.\" The dairy subcommittee concluded that \"More effort should be put into publicising the health benefits of milk in the human diet.\" The meat subcommittee complained that \"criticisms of meat production from an animal-welfare and environmental-impact perspective, and of high levels of red meat consumption as potentially damaging to human health, gained credence from some scientific work\". It called for research into \"manipulation of the immune system\" and the \"application of physical or chemical treatments of carcasses\". \"Concern that the outcome may not be acceptable in the current climate,\" it asserted, \"should not... hold back the related basic research.\" Until the day before he became minister for science and technology in July 1998, Lord Sainsbury chaired another subcommittee, the food chain group. His report, published like all the others by the government's Department of Trade and Industry, expressed the hope that in the future, \"the expensive precautionary principle is abandoned\". (The precautionary principle declares that if there is scientific doubt about the safety of a product or practice, it should not be deployed until that doubt has been dispelled.) \"The most progressive farms,\" the report suggested, would be those on which \"herbicides are applied by robots under the management of satellites.\" Sainsbury and John Battle, then a minister at the DTI, attended a food chain group summit in March 1998 which concluded that this government-funded research programme should involve \"influencing and anticipating future behaviour of consumers\". Summing up, Sainsbury told the delegates: \"It is important for food chain companies to establish better contact with scientists and the people that provide public funds for research. OST [the office of science and technology] and MAFF [the Ministry of Agriculture] can help you make contact with the right people.\" Lord Sainsbury's former interests continue to feature prominently in the department he runs. He presents the prizes to the winners of his ministry's bioscience business plan competition, which is sponsored by Glaxo Wellcome and the Gatsby Charitable Foundation, the science-funding body he established before he became a minister. The chairman of the Institute of Arable Crops Research, appointed by the BBSRC, was previously chairman of the Sainsbury laboratory. An employee of J Sainsbury plc sits on the food and drink foresight panel. At the end of 1998, as public concern about the government's science policies began to emerge, Sainsbury announced a \"nationwide consultation\" to \"explore the wider implications of scientific progress\". He explained that \"Our long-term aim is to build public confidence in the government's use of scientific information.\" The consultation was designed by an advisory group of six people. One of the members of the group was, of course, a senior manager at Zeneca. Another was an employee of J Sainsbury plc. As big business infiltrates the research agenda, ever wider zones of inquiry are placed off-limits. Some of the key questions are left for amateurs and voluntary organisations to investigate. Friends of the Earth and Newsnight studied the pollen flow from the government's test sites for genetically modified crops, for example, only because government researchers were not examining the issue. It was a retired GP, Dr Dick van Steenis, who discovered that the number of primary schoolchildren using asthma inhalers was directly proportionate to the levels of pollution to which they were exposed. Science tells us who we are and how we can live better. It is the glass through which we perceive the world. If distorted, it twists our understanding of the ways in which we might progress, of the alternatives to existing models of development. When our universities are offered for sale, objectivity and intellectual honesty become surplus to requirements. \u0095 This is an edited extract from The Captive State: The Corporate Takeover of Britain by George Monbiot (Macmillan, \u00a312.99).",

In July it emerged that the FBI had been using Carnivore, a black box internet wire-tapping machine, for almost a year; in New Zealand it's the fight against the Echelon surveillance system; in Holland it's against the OCI (operational crypto interception) project. </p> <p>But even without the spectre of the \"technologies of political control\", we are entering an era of hyper-connectivity and data surveillance which would be beyond even Orwell's wildest imaginings. In terms of sheer penetration of \"smart screens\", reality has far outstripped fiction. Most households in Britain by 2004 will have at least two internet-enabled devices - most likely digital TV with broadband internet conection, home computer or mobile, while some of us will have gone the whole hog, with wired cars and kitchen appliances all \"talking\" to each other using Blue Tooth technology and co-ordinating our schedule for the day. </p> <p>Already people talk about how impossible it is to switch off. With ADSL \"always on\" phonelines, there is no escaping the network - unless you unplug every night. Connection speeds will be 20 times faster but that means the computer will be 20 times more susceptible to hacking and data leaks. Barclays bank had a bit of a shock in July when customer data had escaped onto the website. But corporates have the resources to counter these security risks and ultimately it is the average PC owner who should worrying. </p> <p>\"It is almost impossible for the man in the street to be sure that their computer is safe from a break in,\" says Caspar Bowden, spokesperson for FIPR. \"If there is data that you care about, just don't keep it on the machine\". People with broadband connections, he predicts, will feel obliged to fit personal firewalls to stop the threat of unsolicited visits and hacking and there will be a massive boost in sales of piracy tools designed to run rings around the RIP Act. </p> <p>With RIP, we can only trust that the authorities won't abuse their position, but can we trust the advertisers to do the same? The practice of web-tracking is already common amongst some new media agencies. Through a simple combination of cookies which attach themselves to the user when they visit a site, they can already, without their consent, build up profiles of users and follow them several other sites afterwards. Meanwhile, with third generation mobile phones that can pinpoint the user's location to a matter of metres, the central computer can doctor advertising promotions accordingly and in seconds. </p> <p>When consumers sign an online consent form to give up personal details and address information in exchange for offers and promotions - be it an ice lolly or a ticket to Steps - they are giving away precious data which could end up in the hands of third party advertisers or agencies who will pay handsomely for the information. \"It's a trade off - you buy privacy with hard cash. Something could cost you \u00a320 less if you agree to pass on your data,\" says Bowden. </p> <p>Privacy is becoming a privilege we have to pay for. In America, backlash is already happening. The White Dot anti-TV campaign has just launched a controversial book, Spy TV, which exposes the methods by which digital interactive television will observe viewers and build up geographic, demographic and psychographic profiles of individuals which can then be used to \"modify their behaviour\". </p> <p>Motorola Broadband, ACTV and OpenTV have all invested in a company called digital ADCO which is designed to profile over 7m viewers without their knowledge. ACTV promises to deliver commercials based on \"the specific profile of an individual household which is generated by ACTV's software within the digital set-top in the home.\" Every time we change channels, select a certain programme, browse or buy through an interactive site, every click can be tracked. In other words, our TV sets will know us better than we know ourselves. </p> <p>\"People should express concerns about privacy to the data protection commission\", says Bowden, as a last recommendation to any paranoid consumers out there, \"and beware of phrases like 'personalisation' and 'tailor-made'\". </p> <p>New applications and technologies are sold to time-strapped and increasingly technophilic citizens, as a means to introduce more control and convenience into our lives; but ultimately, who is control of our personal details? Answer: the advertisers, marketeers, public authorities, data analysts and even that producer sitting behind the screen in the Big Brother interview room handing out tasks to the guinea pigs and offering kind words of advice.</p>",

Meanwhile, with third generation mobile phones that can pinpoint the user's location to a matter of metres, the central computer can doctor advertising promotions accordingly and in seconds. When consumers sign an online consent form to give up personal details and address information in exchange for offers and promotions - be it an ice lolly or a ticket to Steps - they are giving away precious data which could end up in the hands of third party advertisers or agencies who will pay handsomely for the information. \"It's a trade off - you buy privacy with hard cash. Something could cost you \u00a320 less if you agree to pass on your data,\" says Bowden. Privacy is becoming a privilege we have to pay for. In America, backlash is already happening. The White Dot anti-TV campaign has just launched a controversial book, Spy TV, which exposes the methods by which digital interactive television will observe viewers and build up geographic, demographic and psychographic profiles of individuals which can then be used to \"modify their behaviour\". Motorola Broadband, ACTV and OpenTV have all invested in a company called digital ADCO which is designed to profile over 7m viewers without their knowledge. ACTV promises to deliver commercials based on \"the specific profile of an individual household which is generated by ACTV's software within the digital set-top in the home.\" Every time we change channels, select a certain programme, browse or buy through an interactive site, every click can be tracked. In other words, our TV sets will know us better than we know ourselves. \"People should express concerns about privacy to the data protection commission\", says Bowden, as a last recommendation to any paranoid consumers out there, \"and beware of phrases like 'personalisation' and 'tailor-made'\". New applications and technologies are sold to time-strapped and increasingly technophilic citizens, as a means to introduce more control and convenience into our lives; but ultimately, who is control of our personal details? Answer: the advertisers, marketeers, public authorities, data analysts and even that producer sitting behind the screen in the Big Brother interview room handing out tasks to the guinea pigs and offering kind words of advice.",

The courts will have much more power than before to hold the government and public bodies to account.</p> <p>But how enthusiastically will the judges stride out into the new human rights landscape? Will they flex their muscles at the expense of parliament, the people's elected representatives?</p> <p>From October 2, the act will incorporate the European convention on human rights into UK law, making rights enforceable in the UK courts which could be invoked previously only by a long, hard slog to Strasbourg. The task will be a wholly new one for judges used to poring over and interpreting the strict wording of statutes. They will now be asked to give effect to a broad brush bill of rights. In many cases, precedents of the UK courts, so carefully followed in the past, will become irrelevant.</p> <p>Critics of the Human Rights Act complain that this new power for the British courts to interpret the European human rights convention to protect individuals against abuses of power by elected politicians or public officials involves a significant erosion of the power of parliament. The former Tory home secretary, Michael Howard, argued that balancing individual rights against the exercise of power on behalf of the community at large often involved difficult judgments better made by politicians accountable to the voters than by unelected judges who cannot be dismissed.</p> <p>But the record of parliament, not to mention home secretaries, is not so exemplary when it comes to safeguarding the rights of less popular minorities, such as prisoners, asylum seekers, travellers and gays. Much of the impetus behind the convention was to ensure that minority rights would not be trampled on by the majority.</p> <p>Some leading Tory figures such as Lord Hailsham and Lord Brittan strongly supported the convention's incorporation over the years. But William Hague's party has already begun to attack the change, claiming it will shift legislative power from parliament to the judges and that their more controversial judgments will lack the support of the public. They argue that incorporation will \"weaken our accountable democratic traditions\".</p> <p>One major factor in Labour's conversion to the act was the \"elective dictatorship\" under Margaret Thatcher during which key senior Labour figures overcame the party's traditional hostility to \"Tory judges\" and came to believe that the courts could provide an essential check against an overweening executive.</p> <p>That check contained in the minimum standards set out in the human rights convention will apply not only to the government but to all bodies discharging a public function. It means that private prison companies will have to operate to a minimum set of standards. The courts are also considered a public body, so the convention could be breached if, for instance, an individual had no redress for invasion of privacy by a newspaper.</p> <p>There will be cases in which the judges will have to tread a fine line between the interests of the community, as defined by parliament, and those of the individual who might be bringing the human rights challenge. The question then is who takes precedence - parliament or the judges?</p> <p>The government has drafted the Human Rights Act to ensure that the courts cannot strike down acts of parliament agreed by elected MPs. What the judges will be able to do is to issue a declaration that a statute is incompatible with the European convention.</p> <p>Lord Lester QC, one of the key architects of the Human Rights Act, says that this will leave it to the government and parliament to decide whether to amend the offending legislation or to defend the case before the European court of human rights in Strasbourg. The aggrieved citizen will still have the option of taking the case to Strasbourg if no action is taken to change the law. \"It will be for government and parliament to decide whether to accept the judicial verdict,\" says Lord Lester.</p> <p>The legal principle that parliament still rules was set out this year in the Kebilene case in which Lord Steyn, a law lord, said in a House of Lords judgment: \"It is crystal clear that the carefully and subtly drafted Human Rights Act 1998 preserves the principle of parliamentary sovereignty. In a case of incompatibility of interpretation under section 3(1), the courts may not disapply the legislation.\"</p> <p>Those who advocate incorporation argue that this gets around the problem of giving more power to unelected judges. Because MPs will have the last say and citizens can lobby their MPs, they can do something about it if they take exception to a judge's decision. However, some argue that it will put the government under overwhelming political pressure if a judge issues a declaration that a particular act of parliament is not compatible with human rights.</p> <p>That power, together with the power to strike down secondary legislation such as rules and regulations drawn up by ministers under acts of parliament, will tilt the present balance of power in the judges' favour.</p> <p>In addition, the judges will be drawn into making \"much more obviously political decisions\" in judicial review cases challenging the decisions of ministers and public bodies, the appeal court judge, Sir Henry Brooke, acknowledged last week. He told a conference of the Howard League for Penal Reform that judges would pay appropriate deference to ministers. But he pointed out that for the first time judges would have to decide whether government interference with a human right was \"necessary in a democratic society\" - a clearly political value judgment.</p> <p>How active will the English judges be in applying the convention? In Canada, which adopted a similar charter of rights in 1982 - producing, one senator predicted at the time, in words later adopted by the Scottish judge, Lord McCluskey, \"a field day for crackpots, a pain in the neck for judges and legislators and a goldmine for lawyers\" - the supreme court has struck down a number of statutes. Its rulings have been described by some critics as \"a criminal's charter\".</p> <p>In Scotland, the human rights convention has been partly in force for more than a year as a result of devolution. Members of the executive, including the lord advocate, responsible for prosecutions, are subject to it, but other public bodies will not be covered until next month. Scottish judges have not let many challenges through - only 17 of 587 have succeeded - but although they have used the new powers sparingly they have readily embraced human rights principles.</p> <p>One decision, relying largely on Canadian supreme court case law, has put motoring prosecutions relying on admissions by suspects that they were behind the wheel into limbo, at least until the result of an appeal. Another, that part-time sheriffs were not independent enough of the executive to guarantee a fair trial, threw the court system into disarray. A third, which had little publicity south of the border, has put question marks over the fairness of the Scottish planning system.</p> <p>Ishbel Smith, of the Edinburgh law firm McGrigor Donald, said: \"The decisions show that Scottish judges are not just aware of the convention rights but are prepared to apply them to their full potential, no matter what the consequences.\" Early indications from the cases which have been brought in the run-up to October 2 are that English judges are taking a fairly conservative line, at least in criminal cases.</p> <p>As the judges are drawn further into political controversy the demand for reforms in the way they are appointed is bound to increase. At the same time pressure is likely to grow to establish a human rights commission for England and Wales - similar to the equal opportunities commission and the commission for racial equality - to help individuals bring cases under the new act and to help spread a human rights culture. Northern Ireland already has a human rights commission.</p> <p>The government has not ruled out setting up such a commission but ministers say they are yet to be convinced it is needed. The arrival of incorporation next month is likely to hasten its creation.</p> <p><b>Strasbourg cases that changed UK law</b></p> <p>Ten significant rulings from Strasbourg:</p> <p>1. Prisoners won the right to consult a lawyer, write to an MP or a newspaper, and to sue the Home Office without having to have permission of the home secretary. 1975.</p> <p>2.

      "bodyText": "Eyal Berkovic looks set to join Blackburn later this week, with Christian Dailly moving to Celtic in part-exchange. Teamtalk claims that the deal is nearly done - and all that needs to be discussed is both players' personal terms. Sunderland could break their transfer record by offering \u00a35m for Rangers midfielder Neil McCann, reports Teamtalk. Ipswich manager George Burley has lodged bids for two unnamed players, believed to be Mauricio Taricco and either Gary Naysmith, Colin Cameron or Mark Kerr, reports Teamtalk. Burley admitted: \"We are looking to strengthen our squad by a couple of players this week. I will not talk about contracted players and we won't say too much as we have seen in the past how things can break down.\" Chelsea are about to pay Real Madrid \u00a37m for Savio, the brilliant Brazilian left winger. According to Teamtalk, Real officials say a deal is close to being completed: \"We believe we have completed a deal with Chelsea for Savio. The fee is agreed and there are a few loose ends to tie up, but it is a deal both sides are happy with.\" Teamtalk also claim that Chelsea's Frank Leboeuf is a \u00a34m target for Newcastle. Finnish international wing back Hannu Tihinen is being tracked by Tottenham. The 24-year-old Viking Stavanger defender would cost \"a sizeable sum\", according to Planet Football. Celtic's Brazilian defender Rafael will join Brazilian side Corinthians on a one-year loan. Martin O'Neill hopes the move will become permanent - he has a \u00a34.8m outlay to recoup.",

The PPA has been very encouraging and it\u00cds saying it will accommodate our requirements. \"The timetable is that we will report back at the end of the month, and if the new system meets our expectations we will adopt it.\" Ian Locks, chief executive of the PPA, commented: \"We are delighted Tesco has indicated its wish to work with the industry to build on the existing wholesaler supply chain to create improvements which would include a sales-based replenishment system, leading to reduced waste.\" The PPA objected to the new system proposed by Tesco on the grounds that once the supermarket group and other major chains were stripped out of the franchises distributors would find it uneconomic to deliver magazines to smaller retailers. A recent report suggested such a move by Tesco could ultimately result in the closure of up to 12,000 newsagents and the loss of 15,000 jobs. The distribution deal only covers magazines, but the Newspaper Publishers' Association had expressed concern about the consequences of rural newsagents being forced out of business.",

      "body": "<p>Sir Julian Critchley, who has died of cancer aged 69, was a long-standing Conservative back bench MP who never obtained political office or exercised much formal influence. But he did win much acclaim, and had a public reputation that was far greater than was accorded to most ministers, because of his writing; it was witty and urbane, gently satirising Westminster from an avowed liberal standpoint. He maintained this gift even after he had been physically disabled by the recurrence of teenage polio.</p> <p>His early political life, at Shrewsbury school and at Pembroke College, Oxford, partnered that of Michael Heseltine. They were close friends and Critchley was the best man at Heseltine's wedding. Even in those days, Critchley showed clear traces of robust independence and a commitment to Tory liberalism.</p> <p>For much of his political life, he was at odds with the Whips' Office, sometimes for his views and sometimes for the cavalier way he approached the serious business of Westminster politics. Critchley was once rebuked for modelling a suit for Town, a mildly trendy men's magazine in the early 1960s. The objection was absurd and Critchley was disposed to laugh off such incidents. This calculated indifference of his, while understandable, was a trait he might well have corrected; but he was not deferential by nature.</p> <p>He had little affection for Thatcherite politics or its leading practitioners. During the John Major years, he was happily reconciled to mainstream Conservatism, believing that Major as prime minister should resist any drift to the right, and avowing that Richard Ryder was the best chief whip he had known (not a difficult accolade to award).</p> <p>On key votes Critchley would travel from his home in Ludlow to Westminster to be \"nodded through\", so that he could support such major measures as value added tax on domestic fuel. These loyal journeys were undertaken in great pain, and the gesture of support was much admired.</p> <p>Critchley entered parliament in the 1959 general election as MP for Rochester and Chatham. He was then aged 28, but having captured this marginal seat he lost it again at the election in 1964. He was returned for Aldershot in the 1970 election and held the seat until 1997, when he did not seek re-election.</p> <p>The broken Westminster service between 1964 and 1970 was crucial to Critchley's political career. He was a liberal Tory, supporting one-nation social policies, membership of the European Community, and a defence policy based on Nato and a nuclear strategy. He would have been a natural and able young ally for Edward Heath, campaigning for him against the Conservative right, which was increasingly hostile to the Rome Treaty and current levels of public spending. No one can say how Critchley would have handled his opportunities had he remained in Westminster between 1964 and 1970.</p> <p>He had a lively mind and was a competent parliamentarian who knew the value of the short speech - and the short article, for, according to his colleagues, nobody could write quicker and better for the Guardian. Apart from Europe, his interests were primarily defence, on which he inspired a Bow Group pamphlet, and the politics of the media. He despised the trivia and, as he saw it, the bogus morality of the tabloids.</p> <p>He was always vulnerable because of his irreverent humour, which could lead to incautious and overt disrespect. If he had been able to reign back this, and with application surely he could, then opposition service during the parliaments of the 1960s could have ensured office in the 1970-74 Heath administration. This was not to be. Soon, he was politically marginalised by the triumph of Margaret Thatcher. He doubted her policies and even more the self-righteous way in which they were promoted.</p> <p>Critchley then developed the alternative career that delighted the wide audience that enjoyed his witty political comment. He did not come to politics when he used his pen at university. He wrote sparingly during the 1959 parliament, but after his defeat he widened his journalistic experience and, in 1970, became editor of Town magazine, part of Heseltine's Haymarket Press; it did not prosper under Critchley's guidance. But this did not deter him, and over the years he developed a skill in portraying politics, particularly those of the Conservative party. His victims more often smiled than squirmed. He contributed to most national papers and appeared on radio and television.</p> <p>His new career had its hazards. The combination of his views and casual approach to politics sorely tested some Conservative activists in his Aldershot constituency. Incautiously, he wrote an anonymous, disparaging and vastly amusing article in the Observer about Mrs Thatcher. Predictably the authorship became public, and a force nine storm followed. Critchley survived, but he always needed a praetorian guard of local party friends to ensure his hold on the association.</p> <p>His autobiography, A Bag of Boiled Sweets, published in 1994, was a success, revealing his ability to write beyond the world of politics and detailing his boyhood successes in the boxing ring. His most ambitious political book was Heseltine: The Unauthorised Biography. It was an interesting, rather than a penetrating, study of the Conservative power-broker to whom Critchley would have committed his own fortunes had he followed a more conventional political career.</p> <p>Critchley was immensely proud of his Shropshire heritage, which he related most evocatively in his autobiography. In the early 1990s, he retired to Ludlow, almost immobilised by ill-health. He was tended there by Prudence Bellak, who had been his teenage love. His closing years, although marked by great pain, were profoundly happy because of his re-creation of this relationship.

As online transactions grow, security becomes an ever more urgent issue.</p> <p>For the most part, security comes in the form of passwords, an archaic practice that can quickly degenerate into password hell. IT departments spend an inordinate amount of time helping out employees who have forgotten them. Yet users are warned not to simplify too much because of the security risks. </p> <p>Such risks are real enough, given the regular reports of security breaches of computer systems in both government and commerce (though people tend to forget how easy it is to pinch credit card numbers from discarded carbon copies and they have no qualms about giving credit card information over the phone).</p> <p>The scope for mischief is likely to grow with America, Britain and Ireland circumspectly passing laws making digital signatures legally binding. As the problem of online security looms larger, several US companies are pushing biometrics as the answer. </p> <p>In biometrics, identification is based on physical characteristics such as voice, irises, hands, fingers or fingerprints. Familiar from police identity parades and fingerprinting, biometrics has taken a hi-tech twist with the internet.</p> <p>In the US, the International Biometric Industry Association speaks for what many think could tie up internet security concerns, with companies vying for position in what they believe to be a growing market. </p> <p>Veridicom, a US biometrics company, for example, is busy spreading the gospel in Europe after having seen its fingerprint system adopted by NEC in some laptop models. In order to get access to a computer, a user places a fingerprint on a laptop, that has to correspond with a pre-recorded print.</p> <p>\"This is a very hot and growing market,\" says Naseem Zafar, vice-president of marketing of Veridicom, during a whirlwind European tour. Mr Zafar claims that procurement costs will drop from $175 or $150 per item to a mere $6 with the use of biometric technology, cutting out waste and duplication. </p> <p>Ibia says sales of biometric technology will reach $100m this year, rising to $600m by 2003. Though new, the field is already crowded. There are at least six American companies specialising in fingerprint identification. Others have gone down the route of irises (as seen in Mission: Impossible), faces, hands and signature recognition.</p> <p>The biometric industry does not claim to have invented the \"silver bullet\" that will solve security concerns, but argues that a multilayered system using biometrics in conjunction with other devices such as smart cards or digital certificates - which verify particular personal computers as the origin of electronic transactions - offers the best protection in the internet age.</p> <p>But the use of biometrics does raise privacy issues. Critics worry that their use increases the power of organisations over individuals and warn of \"function creep\", or the use of biometric data for purposes not originally intended. </p> <p>Simon Davies, a visiting fellow at the University of Essex, points out that uses of the social security number in the US, the social insurance number in Canada and the tax file number in Australia were gradually extended to include taxation, unemployment support, pensioner benefits and in some cases health and higher education.</p> <p>There is also the possibility that biometrics will fail to live up to expectations. \"Many systems do not live up to expectations because they prove unable to cope with the enormous variations among populations, or fail to take into account the practicalities of human behaviour, and the needs of people,\" Davies says.</p> <p>Despite concerns over the biometrics field, it is conceivable that people may value convenience and security over privacy. As more and more people conduct transactions such as banking and shopping via the internet over different platforms, including TV, mobile phones and the computer, they will want be sure that they are not getting ripped off by cybercriminals. </p> <p>In which case, biometrics will become commonplace, alongside smart cards, and perhaps password hell will be relegated to the technological graveyard.</p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.ibia.org/understa.htm\">International Biometric Industry Association</a><br><a href=\"http://www.privacyinternational.org/contact.html\">Privacy International</a></p>",

Such risks are real enough, given the regular reports of security breaches of computer systems in both government and commerce (though people tend to forget how easy it is to pinch credit card numbers from discarded carbon copies and they have no qualms about giving credit card information over the phone). The scope for mischief is likely to grow with America, Britain and Ireland circumspectly passing laws making digital signatures legally binding. As the problem of online security looms larger, several US companies are pushing biometrics as the answer. In biometrics, identification is based on physical characteristics such as voice, irises, hands, fingers or fingerprints. Familiar from police identity parades and fingerprinting, biometrics has taken a hi-tech twist with the internet. In the US, the International Biometric Industry Association speaks for what many think could tie up internet security concerns, with companies vying for position in what they believe to be a growing market. Veridicom, a US biometrics company, for example, is busy spreading the gospel in Europe after having seen its fingerprint system adopted by NEC in some laptop models. In order to get access to a computer, a user places a fingerprint on a laptop, that has to correspond with a pre-recorded print. \"This is a very hot and growing market,\" says Naseem Zafar, vice-president of marketing of Veridicom, during a whirlwind European tour. Mr Zafar claims that procurement costs will drop from $175 or $150 per item to a mere $6 with the use of biometric technology, cutting out waste and duplication. Ibia says sales of biometric technology will reach $100m this year, rising to $600m by 2003. Though new, the field is already crowded. There are at least six American companies specialising in fingerprint identification. Others have gone down the route of irises (as seen in Mission: Impossible), faces, hands and signature recognition. The biometric industry does not claim to have invented the \"silver bullet\" that will solve security concerns, but argues that a multilayered system using biometrics in conjunction with other devices such as smart cards or digital certificates - which verify particular personal computers as the origin of electronic transactions - offers the best protection in the internet age. But the use of biometrics does raise privacy issues. Critics worry that their use increases the power of organisations over individuals and warn of \"function creep\", or the use of biometric data for purposes not originally intended. Simon Davies, a visiting fellow at the University of Essex, points out that uses of the social security number in the US, the social insurance number in Canada and the tax file number in Australia were gradually extended to include taxation, unemployment support, pensioner benefits and in some cases health and higher education. There is also the possibility that biometrics will fail to live up to expectations. \"Many systems do not live up to expectations because they prove unable to cope with the enormous variations among populations, or fail to take into account the practicalities of human behaviour, and the needs of people,\" Davies says. Despite concerns over the biometrics field, it is conceivable that people may value convenience and security over privacy. As more and more people conduct transactions such as banking and shopping via the internet over different platforms, including TV, mobile phones and the computer, they will want be sure that they are not getting ripped off by cybercriminals. In which case, biometrics will become commonplace, alongside smart cards, and perhaps password hell will be relegated to the technological graveyard.

It was the only thing on my mind. </p> <p>\"We did win the toss and it was rather gloomy out there to start with. The ball swung a bit but we were off for the light after three or four overs and came back around 15 before lunch. </p> <p>\"Steve Harmison found hitting the pitch a bit difficult - at one stage the scoreboard was [Ian] Ward 8, Butcher 9, Extras 31! Actually it was rather worrying that he might suddenly come up with a jaffa and take you by surprise. We were aware he's not terrible and it can be unnerving just waiting for that straight one. I was concentrating hard - pretty focussed for such an important game. We just wanted to make the most of batting first and get at least 400 for maximum bonus points. </p> <p>\"I like batting with Ward. We move between the wickets well together and that can get us off to a flying start; sometimes it's even better than hitting boundaries. When the ball's moving around, ones or twos to fine leg are important. In the middle we were saying to each other that we mustn't hand over the responsibility to the others. It's been a tough season for batsmen and we were both well set. It was up to us. </p> <p>\"We were scoring at the same rate, but we weren't racing. There were little periods when one or the other would go ahead, but we were concentrating on getting points. I got to 100 one ball before he did in the last session of the day, turning the offspinner [Nicky Phillips] to square for a single. </p> <p>\"Harmison aside, the rest of the Durham bowlers tried to keep it tight and swing it with the new ball. We had to get over that and make them work very hard. A message came out before lunch on the second day saying we were something like 80 short of the record first-class opening partnership for Surrey. Unluckily Ward was out soon after. Records are nice to have afterwards but they don't really occur to you when you're batting. A 400 opening partnership would have been fantastic - we had both set our minds on getting those five points. </p> <p>\"Nadeem Shahid came in - he's great to bat with. He can hit it in a way that is magic to watch, though he's not as quick between the wickets as Ward! Harmison bowled a good spell after lunch on the second day with the new ball: quick and straight. He nipped one back which went between my bat and pad and hit the top of middle stump. </p> <p>\"We only need one point from the match against Lancashire which is fantastic, though it's important for us to win the game after such a good two-thirds of the season. An away win against Lancashire would be a great feather in our cap. </p> <p>\"The success we've achieved over the last two years has come with the same personnel, but we're now playing a lot tougher cricket. We're doing the basics better and are making sure we don't let people back into games. By making fewer basic errors, individuals such as Saqlain [Mushtaq], [Ian] Salisbury, [Martin] Bicknell and [Alistair] Brown can come through. </p> <p>\"If we get the point we'll celebrate, but I don't want to tempt fate. Manchester United are at home to Anderlecht on Wednesday so there'll be quite a crowd within yelling distance of the hotel and lots going on. </p> <p>\"It's been a fantastic summer in the Tests - I've been watching closely. In the past we've been so one-eyed, getting passionate about who's playing, but now people are realising the benefits of winning, whoever's playing. Success gives a good product and the press writes favourably about the game. </p> <p>\"I look back - a couple of decent scores in South Africa and I might have been there. I hadn't found the key to my form in South Africa so it's good for others to come in and help England. I saw Nasser recently and said how well Trescothick's done this summer. </p> <p>\"I hope I'll be in with a shout next summer. I haven't made my plans for the winter yet. I'm quite looking forward to having a quiet one - a bit of football; an English winter. I might be doing a bit of work for Sky and some writing here or there. And the A tour squad hasn't been announced yet...\" </p> <p><em>Mark Butcher was talking to Matthew Hancock.

Records are nice to have afterwards but they don't really occur to you when you're batting. A 400 opening partnership would have been fantastic - we had both set our minds on getting those five points. \"Nadeem Shahid came in - he's great to bat with. He can hit it in a way that is magic to watch, though he's not as quick between the wickets as Ward! Harmison bowled a good spell after lunch on the second day with the new ball: quick and straight. He nipped one back which went between my bat and pad and hit the top of middle stump. \"We only need one point from the match against Lancashire which is fantastic, though it's important for us to win the game after such a good two-thirds of the season. An away win against Lancashire would be a great feather in our cap. \"The success we've achieved over the last two years has come with the same personnel, but we're now playing a lot tougher cricket. We're doing the basics better and are making sure we don't let people back into games. By making fewer basic errors, individuals such as Saqlain [Mushtaq], [Ian] Salisbury, [Martin] Bicknell and [Alistair] Brown can come through. \"If we get the point we'll celebrate, but I don't want to tempt fate. Manchester United are at home to Anderlecht on Wednesday so there'll be quite a crowd within yelling distance of the hotel and lots going on. \"It's been a fantastic summer in the Tests - I've been watching closely. In the past we've been so one-eyed, getting passionate about who's playing, but now people are realising the benefits of winning, whoever's playing. Success gives a good product and the press writes favourably about the game. \"I look back - a couple of decent scores in South Africa and I might have been there. I hadn't found the key to my form in South Africa so it's good for others to come in and help England. I saw Nasser recently and said how well Trescothick's done this summer. \"I hope I'll be in with a shout next summer. I haven't made my plans for the winter yet. I'm quite looking forward to having a quiet one - a bit of football; an English winter. I might be doing a bit of work for Sky and some writing here or there. And the A tour squad hasn't been announced yet...\" Mark Butcher was talking to Matthew Hancock.

A demographic time bomb and a shortage of skilled workers in key areas such as IT mean that Britain should consider changing rules allowing people to settle and work in Britain, Home Office minister Barbara Roche said today. Her comments, made on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, come in advance of a speech later today in which she is expected to call for an open debate on the issue. \"Every country, particularly the EU countries, is looking to see how we can attract the best and the brightest,\" she said. \"We need to make sure that our immigration policy works for us.\" She insisted that the issue was entirely separate from that of asylum, which concerned only those fleeing persecution abroad - and dismissed as \"absolute and complete nonsense\" reports that she was envisaging 100,000 extra immigrants a year under changed rules. The most likely way forward would be for Britain to adopt a version of the US green card system, which allows migrants and their families the right to settle without awarding them full citizenship. However the immigration minister stressed that the government has no firm policy plans on the subject at present. She also called for people to realise that Britain is often not the first choice of potential migrants. \"We do live in a global economy, where skilled people are at a premium and it is not always a buyer's market,\" she noted.",

      "bodyText": "A camera crew filming a beer commercial has damaged the most important shrine at the Peruvian Inca citadel of Machu Picchu. A corner of the granite intihuatana, or \"hitching post of the sun\", was smashed when a camera platform collapsed on top of it. The irregular carved pillar, one of several erected by the Incas at major sites, holds special significance as it was the only intihuatana not to have been discovered and destroyed by the Spanish conquistadores. The structure is thought to have been an astronomical device, possibly used to predict the solstices of the sun, and is reputed to imbue with energy those who approach it. More than a dozen fragments of rock will be painstakingly reattached, but the changeable and intemperate climate means they could eventually fall off again. \"The damage can probably be repaired but [the intihuatana] will never be quite the same again,\" said archaeologist Luis Barreda Murillo. The accident happened during filming of a commercial for Cusque\u00f1a beer, which is produced in the Cusco region where Machu Picchu is situated. Exhausted trekkers, arriving at the ruins after a four-day mountain hike along the Inca trail, watched thirstily as a chilled bottle of the lager and a glass were placed on the intihuatana. Half a dozen members of the crew held up boards to reflect the bright sunshine, and the hapless cameraman was hoisted into the air to film from above. He was slightly injured when the overloaded gantry collapsed on the rock. The commercial was intended as part of a series showcasing the beauty of the Cusco region's historical legacy. Carlos de la Flor, the managing director of the Cervesur company that makes the beer, says his firm was not to blame for the accident but will do whatever it can to help repair the damaged stone. The Walter Thompson agency running the advertising campaign has not commented publicly on the incident. Historians immediately called for a ban on commercial filming at Machu Picchu, South America's most spectacular archaeological site. The area has been designated a Unesco world heritage site and tourists are strictly policed: backpacks and food are forbidden, and whistle-blowing guards prevent visitors from walking on the walls. However, there are currently no limits on the commercial exploitation of the ruins, perched dramatically between two Andean peaks above the Urubamba river. Unesco, alarmed by the rapidly expanding tourist infrastructure at Machu Picchu, has threatened before to designate the area an endangered site. An unsightly hostel and latrines have been built on the Inca trail, and a planned cable car will increase the tourist crowds still further. The latest incident will have done little to convince the organisation that the Peruvian authorities take their stated commitment to protect the park seriously. Built in the 15th century by the Inca emperor Pachacuti, Machu Picchu was abandoned before the 1532 arrival in Peru of the Spanish forces led by Francisco Pizarro. The forgotten settlement therefore avoided the ravages of the conquistadores and was found to be exceptionally well preserved when it was excavated after being rediscovered in 1911 by the US explorer Hiram Bingham.",

This week a new attempt is to be made to settle the actors' strike that is seen as a harbinger of a conflict that could shut down the entire film and television industry next year. Everyone supporting the strike wore gold ribbons as a sign of solidarity with the 135,000 strikers. The demonstration came on the eve of a fresh round of talks in a bid to end the strike which was called in April by the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Arts in protest at proposals to end the system of residual payments for performing in commercials. The unions claim that the changes would leave members significantly worse off. Advertisers say that because of the increasing share that cable takes of advertising, they can no longer afford to pay actors at the current rates. The new talks are to be held in New York on Wednesday. The strike is estimated to be costing the acting profession around $2m (\u00a3 1.4 m) a day. A member of the Frasier cast, John Mahoney, said: \"The actors who do commercials are as much a part of the union as any major star. We're all in this together.

      "body": "<p>A highlight of the 1998 Berlin Film Festival was the 75-film retrospective celebrating the Siodmak Brothers, Robert (who died in 1973) and his younger brother by exactly two years, Curt, who has died aged 98. To the surprise of the audiences, the gnomish Curt had travelled from his home in California and was happy to introduce the movies and meet viewers.</p> <p>Some 25 of the films had his credit, the rest being devoted to Robert Siodmak, who had enjoyed a more elevated career, as is the fortune of directors rather than writers. Curt had contributed to even more films - over 70 in all - than had Robert, mainly as a writer of horror, science fiction and adventure movies.</p> <p>Curt Siodmak occasionally directed and several of his short stories had been turned into feature films. One of his books, Donovan's Brain, had the unusual distinction of being filmed a number of times between 1943 and 1962.</p> <p>Curt Siodmak was born in Germany, where his parents had returned from America. His father was a banker and Robert at first followed that profession, freeing Curt to become a journalist. Then in the mid-1920s he contributed to several screenplays for silent German movies, and the die was cast.</p> <p>The turning point for both brothers came with a remarkable and influential documentary, People On Sunday (1929), which is a minor masterpiece and boasts credits that were rarely equalled in cinema history. Curt Siodmak worked with Billy Wilder on the screenplay, Eugen Schufften and Fred Zinnemann filmed it and the co-directors were Edgar G Ulmer and Robert Siodmak. All enjoyed long and successful careers.</p> <p>Curt went on to write several more German films, but the Siodmak brothers, who were Jewish, decided to work abroad from the mid-1930s, first in France where Curt wrote La Crise Est Finie (1935), directed by his brother. Curt then moved on to England (Robert stayed in Paris until 1939), co-writing Girls Will Be Boys and It's A Bet, I Give My Heart and The Tunnel. He also worked on the famously uncompleted version of I Claudius (1937), starring Charles Laughton and directed by Josef von Sternberg. After Non Stop New York (1937) for Michael Balcon, he moved to the US and began his career as writer and director.</p> <p>His first credit was on Her Jungle Love, a romantic adventure with Dorothy Lamour. Two films, both inspired by H G Wells, The Invisible Man Returns (1939) and Invisible Agent (1942) followed, and the remarkable horror movie The Wolf Man (1941), starring Lon Chaney Jr, which helped establish his career. He gained further credibility with the publication in 1942 of the brilliant horror/fantasy novel Donovan's Brain. This was filmed in 1943 as The Lady And The Monster, with Erich von Stroheim; it fared better under its original title in 1953, later became a TV movie, and then another feature made in Britain in 1962, as Over My Dead Body.</p> <p>Among his other novels Heuser's Memory, published in 1968, was filmed in 1970, and two more of his books, Skyport (1959) and City In The Sky (1974), partly inspired the film adaptation of Ian Fleming's Moonraker in 1978. Other short stories were expanded into screenplays: The Devil's Brood became House Of Frankenstein in 1944 and Girl In Ice became Devil's Messenger in 1962.</p> <p>Although primarily a writer, Curt Siodmak had a short, mundane career as a director with adventures such as Bride Of The Gorilla (1951), Curucu, Beast Of The Amazon (1956) and No 13 Demon Street (1957) among others. Unlike his brother, he never made the transition into A features and almost all his work was in genre movies.</p> <p>But the low budget horror films he wrote proved occasionally memorable, standing up well today. The Beast With Five Fingers (1946), starring Peter Lorre and directed by Robert Florey remains wonderfully atmospheric and scary. I Walked With A Zombie (1943) was an elegant and sensitive work, largely the result of director Jacques Tourneur, for whom Siodmak also provided the story for the semi-documentary thriller, Berlin Express (1947).</p> <p>Curt wrote Son Of Dracula (1943) for his brother to direct, plus The Climax (1944), Frisco Sal (1965) and Tarzan's Magic Fountain (1948). He later wrote the screenplay for the SF picture Riders To The Stars (1954), for Richard Carlson, an actor turned director: they worked together on several films.</p> <p>Curt's other credits include a German-made adaptation of a Conan Doyle story, Sherlock Holmes And The Deadly Necklace (1962), directed by Terence Fisher and starring Christopher Lee. During the 1960s, as television increasingly led to the demise of small budget movies, Curt Siodmak ended his directorial career with a Swiss-Czech production, Ski Fever (1966). He also looked abroad for work, but only a TV movie in Germany, Die Heiligenschein (1977) was available.</p> <p>He had remained on the sidelines of mainstream cinema, working in several countries with fine co-writers, actors and directors. Of the six young hopefuls who had made that documentary about ordinary people on a Sunday in Berlin, Curt Siodmak had the least distinguished career.</p> <p>But his quirky, inventive talent displayed innate professionalism; the whole history of the movies would have been much poorer without such mavericks and journeymen, the backbone of popular cinema.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife of 75 years, Henrietta; a son, and two granddaughters.</p>",

Lawrence had to send them back to his home in New Mexico to stop them being destroyed. The new work lay undocumented for 40 years after the death of Frieda in 1956. Lawrence himself died in 1930. John Worthen, professor of DH Lawrence studies at the university, said the screen silk was quite unlike the rest of his work - \"like a lino cut, but done on silk\".

Shell recently announced sheepishly that it had made \u00a326m a day over the first six months of the year, but then called on OPEC to increase production to bring down the price of crude. Why? Because what they really want is highish crude prices: ones that are sustainable in the long term and which do not trigger a backlash from politicians worried about inflation or global recession and consumers fed up with paying a fortune to fill up their cars When oil prices are very high, oil groups fear exactly what has happened over the past week: oil depots around the country being brought to a standstill by angry hauliers. The truckers are blaming government for levying too much tax but the oil companies inevitably get some of the flak for alleged profiteering too and have their operations disrupted. Sir John Browne, chief executive of BP, recently unveiled a 200% increase in first-half profits, but went on to express his sympathy for the \"Dump the Pump\" campaign by motorists arguing that government should reduce its tax take. Nevertheless, oil companies are also fearful that politicians could levy windfall taxes on them or just tighten the fiscal regime covering the development of oil fields in the North Sea. In fact, the margins for oil companies on the forecourt are slim due to the intense competition from supermarkets that partly use petrol as a loss leader. Shell recently shutdown 120 service stations in Britain on the grounds that they do not make enough money, which might seem odd given it made overall group profits of nearly \u00a34.5bn in the half year. But major UK-based oil corporations like Shell and BP - two of the world's big three - make their money on the \"upstream\" side, bringing the black stuff out of the ground and selling it on to their own or others' refineries for processing into petrol for cars, aviation fuel or whatever. The oil companies themselves have little control over the price of oil. They will see their share price rocket ahead in times like today but fall heavily when the crude price drops as it has done cyclically ever since oil first became used as a fuel in a widespread way earlier last century.

Leader David Pessell said today he did not know the size of the maritime contingent, but added: \"The fishermen will be there.\"</p> <p>Demonstrators say that the blockades will continue until the government takes action to reduce the price of fuel. TUC general secretary John Monks told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: \"I wouldn't rule out the government taking action to reduce fuel duty, but the major factor is not moving our taxation up and down every time the fuel price changes, but getting the fuel price down.\"</p> <p>Sir Ken Jackson, general secretary of the AEEU union, joined the calls on the Today programme: \"The French government obviously is now helping French industry, and British industry could do with a shot in the arm at this time, not a shot in the head.\"</p> <p>But Tony Blair today remained firm, addressing an audience in Loughborough. While he expressed sympathy for those caught financially, he said protests could only have one outcome.</p> <p>\"We cannot and will not alter government policy on petrol through blockades and pickets,\" he said. \"That's not the way to make policy in Britain and as far as I'm concerned it never will be.\"</p> <p>Earlier in the day, trade and industry secretary Stephen Byers asked: \"What people need to answer is if they want to see a cut in fuel duty, 2p off a litre is \u00a31 billion off public spending - where are these cuts going to occur?</p> <p>\"The actual percentage of tax being put on petrol today is lower than it was when we took office in May 1997. It was 78% then and is down to 76% now,\" he said.</p> <p>\"If you look at taxation in the round and take into account business and social costs, then the motorist in the UK is not being discriminated against.\"</p> <p>Mr Byers insisted that there was no danger of fuel supplies drying up, saying that shortages at the pumps were due to panic buying, not to the effect of demonstrations. He confirmed that the government had contingency measures in place to deal with prospective shortages.</p> <p>He also stressed he expected the police to take action ensure that the blockages did not stop fuel supplies from flowing. \"There is a very important point of principle here. In Britain, questions of taxation are decided in the Budget. They are not decided by blockades in the streets.\"</p> <p>So far relations between protesters and the authorities nationwide have so far remained largely respectful. At the Texaco plant in Pembroke, police allowed truckers onto the site to use showers and toilets, while they drank cups of tea with demonstrators.</p> <p>David Kern, chief economist at NatWest stockbrokers, said yesterday's Opec gesture would make little difference in the short-term but help prices stabilise over time. It was \"better than nothing\", he said.</p> <p>With 200 forecourts now shut in north-west England, Roy Holloway, director of the Petrol Retailers' Association, said: \"It is not critical by any means but it is getting worse. If these actions continue into the early part of next week there will be severe difficulties.\"</p> <p>On the continent, meanwhile, it was announced that all blockades at France's refineries and depots had been lifted after a deal between the government and unions. Stranded holidaymakers may still have to wait several days before filling stations are re-stocked.</p>",

Liverpool taxi drivers are expected to organise similar protests during the evening rush hour today in a gesture of solidarity, hitting the two tunnels which link the city to the Wirral under the river Mersey. Fishermen in Plymouth are set to join in the protests for the first time tonight, linking up with farmers and hauliers to prevent fuel leaving a depot in the Cattedown area. Leader David Pessell said today he did not know the size of the maritime contingent, but added: \"The fishermen will be there.\" Demonstrators say that the blockades will continue until the government takes action to reduce the price of fuel. TUC general secretary John Monks told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: \"I wouldn't rule out the government taking action to reduce fuel duty, but the major factor is not moving our taxation up and down every time the fuel price changes, but getting the fuel price down.\" Sir Ken Jackson, general secretary of the AEEU union, joined the calls on the Today programme: \"The French government obviously is now helping French industry, and British industry could do with a shot in the arm at this time, not a shot in the head.\" But Tony Blair today remained firm, addressing an audience in Loughborough. While he expressed sympathy for those caught financially, he said protests could only have one outcome. \"We cannot and will not alter government policy on petrol through blockades and pickets,\" he said. \"That's not the way to make policy in Britain and as far as I'm concerned it never will be.\" Earlier in the day, trade and industry secretary Stephen Byers asked: \"What people need to answer is if they want to see a cut in fuel duty, 2p off a litre is \u00a31 billion off public spending - where are these cuts going to occur? \"The actual percentage of tax being put on petrol today is lower than it was when we took office in May 1997. It was 78% then and is down to 76% now,\" he said. \"If you look at taxation in the round and take into account business and social costs, then the motorist in the UK is not being discriminated against.\" Mr Byers insisted that there was no danger of fuel supplies drying up, saying that shortages at the pumps were due to panic buying, not to the effect of demonstrations. He confirmed that the government had contingency measures in place to deal with prospective shortages. He also stressed he expected the police to take action ensure that the blockages did not stop fuel supplies from flowing. \"There is a very important point of principle here. In Britain, questions of taxation are decided in the Budget. They are not decided by blockades in the streets.\" So far relations between protesters and the authorities nationwide have so far remained largely respectful. At the Texaco plant in Pembroke, police allowed truckers onto the site to use showers and toilets, while they drank cups of tea with demonstrators. David Kern, chief economist at NatWest stockbrokers, said yesterday's Opec gesture would make little difference in the short-term but help prices stabilise over time. It was \"better than nothing\", he said. With 200 forecourts now shut in north-west England, Roy Holloway, director of the Petrol Retailers' Association, said: \"It is not critical by any means but it is getting worse. If these actions continue into the early part of next week there will be severe difficulties.\" On the continent, meanwhile, it was announced that all blockades at France's refineries and depots had been lifted after a deal between the government and unions. Stranded holidaymakers may still have to wait several days before filling stations are re-stocked.",

But while French fuel tankers, exempted from a customary weekend ban, raced to resupply the 85% of France's petrol stations that had run dry, German truckers were moving to fill the breach, threatening nationwide motorway and road blockades yesterday after Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's coalition rejected calls for the abolition of its controversial ecological fuel tax. Bernward Franzky, director of the road hauliers association in Lower Saxony, warned: \"Whole autobahns risk being brought to a standstill. The situation is getting out of control.\" Germany's lorry drivers began disrupting traffic at the weekend. On Saturday 120 lorries sealed off the north German town of Hildesheim for several hours. On Friday 40 truck drivers drove into the town of Uelzen in the same region and blocked off the centre during a visit by German transport minister Reinhard Klimmt. Even in France where the dispute was winding down, oil companies warned it would be several days before the situation returned to normal. The French interior ministry said the final seven blockades, manned by militant farmers and road hauliers who were still unhappy with the 15% fuel tax cut they had wrested from the government, had been dismantled by midday. Motorists immediately besieged the restocked stations, forming bumper-to-bumper queues and waiting as long as three hours to be served. The hauliers, who wanted a 20% cut in state diesel taxes to compensate the soaring price of crude oil, reluctantly accepted the government's offer after the prime minister, Lionel Jospin, under pressure from his Green party coalition partners, told them it was final. Negotiators from the second biggest French hauliers' group, Unostra, followed those from its sister organisation FNTR on Saturday in recommending its members lift the 160 blockades around the country. The farmers union FNSEU, which won a 30% reduction in state fuel taxes, quickly followed suit. The German lorry drivers have demanded reductions in VAT on fuel, car tax and ecological fuel tax to compensate for the rise in fuel prices. However, German finance minister Hans Eichel ruled out scrapping the ecology tax, one of the chief policy initiatives of Chancellor Schroeder's coalition of Social Democrats and Greens introduced last year. The risk of protests also appeared to be growing elsewhere in Europe. Italian fishermen occupied quays around the country and warned the government they would blockade ports if it refused to reduce duties on the fuel they use.

After a week of intense diplomatic pressure from US and European policymakers, ministers from the 11-nation oil cartel, Opec, announced yesterday that they would add an extra 800,000 barrels a day, or 3%, to world production. \"Opec cares very much about stability in the oil market with fair and reasonable prices for consumers and is trying very hard to bring this about,\" said the Opec president, Ali Rodriguez of Venezuela, after their meeting in Vienna. The announcement came as oil refinery picketing and \"rolling road blocks\" across the UK intensified with petrol companies admitting that up to 100 petrol stations, mainly in north-west England, had run dry. Protests continued at Shell's giant refinery at Stanlow, Cheshire, and at Milford Haven in Wales - and the A1 near Alnwick was targeted by hauliers and farmers with a slow moving convoy blocking lanes. Campaigners warned that 80 rolling roadblocks would start around England and Wales early today to complement a nationwide picket of depots. Welsh farmers are planning to dump 16 tonnes of straw outside the Shell plant at Stanlow today to prevent tankers leaving the refinery. And last night there were increasingly confrontational scenes at the Immingham refinery complex at the mouth of the River Humber. Blockades in France were scaled down yesterday but in Germany protests at the pro-green fuel tax saw the first blockades there. The world's top consumer of oil, the US, called the Opec agreement \"a step in the right direction\". In the UK, the Scottish secretary, John Reid, welcomed the news. However, energy analysts warned that while the deal - which was more generous than expected - should prevent oil prices from rising further, it was unlikely to reduce them significantly in the short term. Last week, oil prices hit a post Gulf war high of $34.50 a barrel. Lawrence Eagles, from City firm GNI Securities, doubted the Opec decision would bring down prices to less than $30 - and warned that planned closures of European refineries for maintenance would keep up petrol prices by reducing supplies. Opec has blamed heavy duties imposed by western finance ministries for the high petrol prices. \"We think this is enough but we want consumer nations to work to reduce taxes,\" said Qatar oil minister, Abdullah bin Hamad Al Attiyah. Yesterday's production increase is effective from October 1 and Opec also announced that it will review output again at an extraordinary meeting on November 12. Mr Eagles said the announcement of the November meeting was a sign that the cartel was serious about tackling the oil shortage. But most analysts believe it will be some months before prices ease back down to the $20-$25 a barrel comfort zone sought by politicians in the US and Europe.",

But adoption panels have difficult choices to make. North Tyneside children's services was presented with a puzzle.

The application was unusual as the couple had only been married for a short time and there was no medical reason to suppose that they could not have children. But they belong to an evangelical sect and believe that God has called on them to take care of some of Britain's abandoned children. </p> <p>In the series we see members of their Christian group visit their home and, eyes downcast in humility, entreat the Lord to grant Al and Paula their wish. But then there was a phone call announcing that their application had been deferred. The adoption panel was worried that the couple might belong to a sect. \"We were gobsmacked,\" Al said. \"We had never heard of deferment.\" </p> <p>Their social worker, Carolyn McKelvie, said: \"When they first came to adopt they were keen to adopt a huge number of children - six or seven. There were reservations that they might want to be caretakers rather than parents. From the panel's perspective we needed to explore in more depth.

Mark and Sarah's attempt to bring their Chinese child to Britain appeared to founder when a letter arrived from Joshua's birth mother in Romania, asking them to adopt her new baby.

The generals and strategists who had planned the rescue mission in minute detail knew full well that if the British troops failed to overpower the rebels swiftly and brutally, the lives of the hostages would almost certainly be lost. The first glimpse of a helicopter could have caused the notoriously volatile West Side Boys to start executing hostages.</p> <p>Within 20 minutes of the mission starting, the hostages were in a helicopter being whisked back to the safety of a British ship anchored off Freetown. Their colleagues - including members of the renowned Parachute Regiment, backed up by the SAS - spent another 70 minutes in sporadic but fierce exchanges.</p> <p>When the battle was over, 25 West Side Boys were dead and 18, including their leader, were captured. One British paratrooper was dead, one was seriously injured and 11 had less severe wounds.</p> <p>Despite the deaths, military chiefs hailed the mission a success, but critics believe that it throws up more questions than it answers - wider questions about the precise nature of the British troops in Sierra Leone and, more specifically, exactly what the captured troops were doing in a rebel-held area.</p> <p>The problems facing the planners of the rescue were legion. One defence chief said it was the \"most complex\" mission carried out by British troops for years.</p> <p>First there was the very difficult terrain. The West Side Boys were based in two camps on either side of the Rokel creek, a 300m-wide river boarded by mangrove swamps, jungle, mud flats and scrubland. They knew the area intimately and were experienced in jungle fighting. They have tended to be portrayed as a bunch of ill-organised youngsters often high on drink and drugs. Yet during the battle, they were well-armed and aggressive.</p> <p><b> Wreaked havoc</b><br></p> <p>They had set up an effective encampment, straddling both sides of the river. On the northern bank was their headquarters, where the hostages were held, guarded by some 50 or 60 men and women. Another 50 or so were stationed in the village of Magbeni, on the southern bank.</p> <p>British intelligence believed that in the immediate area there were about 200 members of the group. It was impossible for the troops to target only the northern camp, as the southern was equipped with heavy machine guns which could have wreaked havoc on the invaders. A two-pronged helicopter attack with synchronised landings at both camps was considered the best option.</p> <p>The operation began at first light, 6.16am local time. There was just enough light for the five helicopters - two Lynx attack machines and three Chinook troop carriers - which ferried members of the crack 1st Battalion The Parachute Regiment into the camps, but enough gloom to give them a degree of protection. In all, 150 British servicemen were involved. The SAS role remains unknown, but it is thought likely that they had been on the ground, supplying information about the rebels, and would almost certainly have joined in the attack.</p> <p>It was crucial that the troops, backed by fire from the Lynx helicopters and using mortars, were able to disembark rapidly and get to the hostages.</p> <p>The helicopters landed within 100 yards of the camps and immediately came under \"sustained fire\", at first from within the village and then from the edges of the jungle when the rebels retreated.</p> <p>Within 20 minutes the hostages were being flown out to safety. Heavy but sporadic gun battles continued for the next hour and a half until British troops secured the area. By mid afternoon all the British troops - along with the three vehicles which had been stolen by the rebels when they took the hostages - had been airlifted out.</p> <p>Twenty five West Side Boys, including three women, were killed. Eighteen, including their leader, \"Brigadier\" Foday Kallay, were captured.</p> <p>The six members of the Royal Irish Regiment, together with five who were subsequently released and a Sierra Leonean official, were captured on August 25. Mystery still surrounds the circumstances. Two days later the West Side Boys issued demands, including the release from prison of a leader named \"Bomb Blast\".</p> <p>After five days of negotiations the army announced that it had secured the release of the five junior members of the British group. The delicate process of negotiation continued. But at the same time plans were being laid to free the hostages forcibly if the talks failed. They had tracked the rebels down to the camps on the Rokel creek - and begun detailed reconnaissance.</p> <p>By the start of last week Tony Blair and the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, were directly involved, discussing the matter with General Sir Charles Guthrie, chief of defence staff, at a cabinet committee meeting. Defence chiefs warned that the rebels' threats to kill the hostages had to be taken seriously - and had been reinforced with \"mock executions\". The army also feared the rebels might move or split up the hostages.</p> <p>Last Tuesday, the MoD sent out soldiers from the elite Parachute Regiment to the region.

      "bodyText": "Speed was the crucial factor. The generals and strategists who had planned the rescue mission in minute detail knew full well that if the British troops failed to overpower the rebels swiftly and brutally, the lives of the hostages would almost certainly be lost. The first glimpse of a helicopter could have caused the notoriously volatile West Side Boys to start executing hostages. Within 20 minutes of the mission starting, the hostages were in a helicopter being whisked back to the safety of a British ship anchored off Freetown. Their colleagues - including members of the renowned Parachute Regiment, backed up by the SAS - spent another 70 minutes in sporadic but fierce exchanges. When the battle was over, 25 West Side Boys were dead and 18, including their leader, were captured. One British paratrooper was dead, one was seriously injured and 11 had less severe wounds. Despite the deaths, military chiefs hailed the mission a success, but critics believe that it throws up more questions than it answers - wider questions about the precise nature of the British troops in Sierra Leone and, more specifically, exactly what the captured troops were doing in a rebel-held area. The problems facing the planners of the rescue were legion. One defence chief said it was the \"most complex\" mission carried out by British troops for years. First there was the very difficult terrain. The West Side Boys were based in two camps on either side of the Rokel creek, a 300m-wide river boarded by mangrove swamps, jungle, mud flats and scrubland. They knew the area intimately and were experienced in jungle fighting. They have tended to be portrayed as a bunch of ill-organised youngsters often high on drink and drugs. Yet during the battle, they were well-armed and aggressive. Wreaked havoc They had set up an effective encampment, straddling both sides of the river. On the northern bank was their headquarters, where the hostages were held, guarded by some 50 or 60 men and women. Another 50 or so were stationed in the village of Magbeni, on the southern bank. British intelligence believed that in the immediate area there were about 200 members of the group. It was impossible for the troops to target only the northern camp, as the southern was equipped with heavy machine guns which could have wreaked havoc on the invaders. A two-pronged helicopter attack with synchronised landings at both camps was considered the best option. The operation began at first light, 6.16am local time. There was just enough light for the five helicopters - two Lynx attack machines and three Chinook troop carriers - which ferried members of the crack 1st Battalion The Parachute Regiment into the camps, but enough gloom to give them a degree of protection. In all, 150 British servicemen were involved. The SAS role remains unknown, but it is thought likely that they had been on the ground, supplying information about the rebels, and would almost certainly have joined in the attack. It was crucial that the troops, backed by fire from the Lynx helicopters and using mortars, were able to disembark rapidly and get to the hostages. The helicopters landed within 100 yards of the camps and immediately came under \"sustained fire\", at first from within the village and then from the edges of the jungle when the rebels retreated. Within 20 minutes the hostages were being flown out to safety. Heavy but sporadic gun battles continued for the next hour and a half until British troops secured the area. By mid afternoon all the British troops - along with the three vehicles which had been stolen by the rebels when they took the hostages - had been airlifted out. Twenty five West Side Boys, including three women, were killed. Eighteen, including their leader, \"Brigadier\" Foday Kallay, were captured. The six members of the Royal Irish Regiment, together with five who were subsequently released and a Sierra Leonean official, were captured on August 25. Mystery still surrounds the circumstances. Two days later the West Side Boys issued demands, including the release from prison of a leader named \"Bomb Blast\". After five days of negotiations the army announced that it had secured the release of the five junior members of the British group. The delicate process of negotiation continued. But at the same time plans were being laid to free the hostages forcibly if the talks failed. They had tracked the rebels down to the camps on the Rokel creek - and begun detailed reconnaissance. By the start of last week Tony Blair and the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, were directly involved, discussing the matter with General Sir Charles Guthrie, chief of defence staff, at a cabinet committee meeting. Defence chiefs warned that the rebels' threats to kill the hostages had to be taken seriously - and had been reinforced with \"mock executions\". The army also feared the rebels might move or split up the hostages. Last Tuesday, the MoD sent out soldiers from the elite Parachute Regiment to the region. Defence chiefs urged the press not to dramatise the move, realising that it could spook the West Side Boys. The paras, who had spent some time in Sierra Leone earlier in the summer, flew to Senegal, then began arriving in Freetown on Thursday evening. The Lynx helicopters were brought on Hercules planes and assembled on the spot, and the Chinooks moved from Dakar, capital of Senegal. Permission to mount the rescue was given by Mr Blair last Wednesday from New York, where he was attending the UN millennium summit. It was still hoped that an agreement could be reached. There were discussions with the rebels as late as yesterday, but Mr Kallay returned to his original demands for the release of comrades from prison and the resignation of the Sierra Leone government. He said that if his demands were not met he would take the Britons further inland, implicitly suggesting that they would be handed to the rebel Revolutionary United Front. In the eyes of the British officers present, that amounted to a death threat. There were other worrying signs. The West Side Boys launched an attack on a rival militia on Thursday, prompting a response that took the fighting close to where the British soldiers were held. British negotiators were also disturbed that Mr Kallay was seen wearing a British army uniform, and that a heavily-armed captured Land Rover was used in attacks on the rival militia. Powerful message The primary aim of the mission was to rescue the hostages. A secondary aim was to capture Mr Kallay, though yesterday ministers insisted that destroying the West Side Boys as a whole was not intended. Besides, intelligence experts had concluded that the organisation was not a coherent whole but a number of independent groups who could not be blasted out of existence in one swoop. The government also wanted to send a \"powerful\" message that it was not acceptable for rebel forces to take British hostages. Mr Blair was contacted again on Saturday afternoon at Chequers to be told further details, and the fact that the raid would start at first light on Sunday morning. He again gave the endorsement. Over the next days and weeks the operation will be dissected in detail. But key among the issues to be addressed is exactly what 11 British soldiers were doing in \"bandit territory\".

In France, an employer must pay a penalty to social security for the cost of forcing someone to retire early; the Germans are introducing a 4% contribution to a scheme to pay for early leavers.

Where there's smoke, there's fire and I think I have found a place that will sell the precious liquid.</p> <p>I position my vehicle in the queue and settle in for the long wait. As dawn breaks, I take a stroll and see people sleeping in their vehicles, some drinking tea from flasks and many others huddled in groups discussing the situation. The fuel queues that snake throughout Harare are lively centres of political discussions.</p> <p>Zimbabwe's racial and class divisions break down as everyone finds common cause in blaming the government for the fuel shortage. Black truck drivers, white housewives and Asian shop owners shake their heads in disgust at the dire straits of the Zimbabwean economy. One woman blames the war in the Congo. A man says it is corruption. Everyone agrees that things will not get better until Robert Mugabe leaves power.</p> <p>After reaching that conclusion they get back to the pressing matter of getting diesel. How long is the queue? How much fuel did the station get yesterday? Will they let us fill up? Or will they only sell us a quarter of a tank?</p> <p>Zimbabwe has been suffering a shortage of petroleum-based fuels since December last year because President Mugabe's government has run out of the foreign exchange needed to import adequate supplies. Zimbabweans have watched with interest as France threatens to grind to a halt because of the week-long blockade on its petroleum fuels. \"The news makes it seem like they have it bad in France,\" said the manager of a factory which makes rubber hoses. \"They say businesses cannot make deliveries. Well, we have had those problems all year. Imagine trying to keep a factory going when you cannot get regular supplies and you cannot make regular deliveries. It is a nightmare. But we carry on.\"</p> <p>Everyone in Zimbabwe has been struggling to cope with a drastic fuel shortage for the entire year. It is estimated Zimbabwe has been operating on less than 50% of its normal consumption for 10 months. In September the situation became even more desperate, especially for diesel. Tankers bringing fuel from Kuwait arrived at the Mozambican port of Beira, landlocked Zimbabwe's nearest outlet to the sea, but they refused to offload their cargo because they had not been paid. The state-owned National Oil Company of Zimbabwe has defaulted on so many payments that Zimbabwe has lost all international lines of credit and must now pay cash up front for all deliveries of fuel.</p> <p>By 7am the sun is up and the heat of the day begins to rise. Tempers also become heated when a vehicle tries to wedge in at the front of the queue. People who slept in their vehicles all night jump out and shout at the driver. He glumly drives to the back of the queue which is now more than 150 vehicles.</p> <p>Police are now patrolling the area to prevent any violence. The shortage of fuel is so desperate that there have been shootings and brawls in queues. For a week now, police have been called out to maintain order.</p> <p>The queue begins to move and we all rush back to our cars and trucks. I read the paper and every few minutes start my car to move forward. Some are so short of fuel they push their cars along the queue. The sun is now high and scorching but I don't mind because I am now in sight of the pumps. I can't believe my luck when I pull up and get a full tank.</p> <p>It is after 11am when I drive home. I am tired and hot and the morning is shot, but I am elated with my score. I have a full tank, but the nagging thought is that the Zimbabwean economy is running on empty.</p>",

Zimbabweans have watched with interest as France threatens to grind to a halt because of the week-long blockade on its petroleum fuels. \"The news makes it seem like they have it bad in France,\" said the manager of a factory which makes rubber hoses. \"They say businesses cannot make deliveries. Well, we have had those problems all year. Imagine trying to keep a factory going when you cannot get regular supplies and you cannot make regular deliveries. It is a nightmare. But we carry on.\" Everyone in Zimbabwe has been struggling to cope with a drastic fuel shortage for the entire year. It is estimated Zimbabwe has been operating on less than 50% of its normal consumption for 10 months. In September the situation became even more desperate, especially for diesel. Tankers bringing fuel from Kuwait arrived at the Mozambican port of Beira, landlocked Zimbabwe's nearest outlet to the sea, but they refused to offload their cargo because they had not been paid. The state-owned National Oil Company of Zimbabwe has defaulted on so many payments that Zimbabwe has lost all international lines of credit and must now pay cash up front for all deliveries of fuel. By 7am the sun is up and the heat of the day begins to rise. Tempers also become heated when a vehicle tries to wedge in at the front of the queue. People who slept in their vehicles all night jump out and shout at the driver. He glumly drives to the back of the queue which is now more than 150 vehicles. Police are now patrolling the area to prevent any violence. The shortage of fuel is so desperate that there have been shootings and brawls in queues. For a week now, police have been called out to maintain order. The queue begins to move and we all rush back to our cars and trucks. I read the paper and every few minutes start my car to move forward. Some are so short of fuel they push their cars along the queue. The sun is now high and scorching but I don't mind because I am now in sight of the pumps. I can't believe my luck when I pull up and get a full tank. It is after 11am when I drive home. I am tired and hot and the morning is shot, but I am elated with my score. I have a full tank, but the nagging thought is that the Zimbabwean economy is running on empty.",

Two weeks ago ministers and officials from the foreign, defence, overseas development and other departments met in Whitehall to discuss involvement in Sierra Leone against the background of the 11 British soldiers having been taken hostage. The meeting had been scheduled before the hostage-taking and was born out of wider concerns: some officials privately questioned whether ministers had a credible strategy in place that would allow Britain eventually to pull out of the country with honour. British policy is being driven by the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, who was deeply affected by the sight of thousands of limbless victims of the rebel Revolutionary United Front on a visit to Freetown in June.

The strategy is to have a contingent of about 300, and to train the Sierra Leone army (SLA) to a standard at which it will be capable of defending Freetown and making inroads into the rebel heartlands, the diamond-producing areas that fund the war. It is a daunting task - but no less daunting is the other half of the strategy: hoping that the chaotic UN peacekeeping force can get its act together sufficiently to bolster the SLA when it eventually goes into action.

It is made of human urine, pubic hairs, an eyelash and a handful of bent pins. The witch bottle, as such charms were known, still contained almost half a pint of 300-year-old urine. Witch bottles were made by people who believed their illness or misfortune, the death of family members or livestock, meant they had been cursed. The bottles were intended to turn the curse back on the witch. Although the urine was that of the victim, it was believed there was such a strong link between the curser and the cursed that the charm would work on the witch, for as long as the bottle remained sealed. Alan Massey, a retired organic chemist from Loughborough University who carried out the analysis, said: \"In this case the curse was intended to make the unfortunate object of it feel as if they were weeing with a bladder full of bent pins.\" His work, published in the journal Current Archaeology, has proved the folk belief that such bottles did contain human urine. Although more than 200 witch bottles, dating mainly from the late 16th to the early 18th centuries, have been found, almost all were broken or empty. This witch bottle was found sealed with all its contents intact despite being buried more than 300 years ago in the foundations of a house which was demolished in the 18th century near the ramparts of the castle in Reigate. It was discovered by the archaeologist David Williams, who jumped to the obvious conclusion about a sealed wine bottle. \"I managed to get a local vineyard interested and they arranged to open the bottle, test the contents and possibly organise a tasting,\" he said. \"When the cork was pulled there was a rather alarming hiss of escaping gas.

Peter Mandelson, the Labour minister initially responsible for the dome, yesterday declined to take the blame for the project's failure. Speaking on BBC TV's Breakfast with Frost he said: \"If there have been mistakes more recently or this year then they should certainly be an inquiry into those.

Downing Street claimed the book, written by Andrew Rawnsley and serialised in the Observer yesterday, was 100% wrong. It was dismissed by a Treasury spokesman as malicious and unsubstantiated gossip. The spokesman said it was \"laughable\" to suggest Mr Brown had earlier this year threatened to resign in protest over a speech by the Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, implying Britain had to join the euro if manufacturing was not to be left defenceless. However, the personal involvement of the prime minister in the Rawnsley book makes it more difficult to dismiss all its claims as the figment of the author's imagination. Mr Rawnsley's account came as the Mail on Sunday serialised an unauthorised biography of the cabinet minister, Mo Mowlam. The book, by Julia Langdon, claims Ms Mowlam felt humiliated by the way in which she was sidelined by Blair and other Downing Street officials in the Northern Ireland peace talks. The extracts claims that Bill Clinton, the US president, was warmer to her than Mr Blair. She apparently told Mr Clinton: \"Don't you know I am the new tea lady around here?\" Both books confirm that Ms Mowlam turned down Mr Blair's offer to become health secretary after he told her she had to be shifted from Northern Ireland. On being told by Mr Blair that she had to leave Northern Ireland, Ms Mowlam first asked to be made foreign secretary, but when Mr Blair insisted there was no vacancy, she asked to be appointed defence secretary. The books claim Ms Mowlam had contempt for Mr Mandelson and distrusted his personal assurances to her by phone in the summer of 1998 that he was not seeking to take over her job. Mr Mandelson is said to have described her as terminally undisciplined. The Langdon book also alleges that Ms Mowlam's messy sex life led to an alarmed John Smith, then Labour leader, refusing to promote her to a senior job. It also details claims that in the early 90s, Ms Mowlam fell out with Mr Brown, blighting her chances of promotion. It suggests Mr Brown believed Ms Mowlam was briefing the press that he was gay. The Rawnsley book - the fullest account yet of Labour's decision to rule out membership of the single currency in this parliament - alleges that Mr Brown failed to brief Mr Blair properly of his plans. In stead the chancellor gave the prime minister only a short account at a time when Mr Blair was distracted by reports that Clare Short, the international development secretary, might face charges over an altercation with a police officer over security checks at the Labour conference. The book claims Mr Brown's decision to shift the policy through an interview in the Times was agreed with Alastair Campbell, the press secretary. Once the first edition of the Times appeared, an amazed Mr Mandelson rang Mr Blair at Chequers and asked him if he had agreed the policy change. Mr Blair apparently said: \"I don't know.\" The prime minister then tried to contact Mr Campbell but his press secretary failed to answer his calls. In desperation, Mr Blair then rang the chancellor's press secretary, Charlie Whelan, and asked him to reverse the policy. Mr Whelan, who had been briefing the media from the Red Lion pub near the Commons, said it was too late. The book also claims Mr Brown shouted at Mr Blair over his decision to announce plans for a huge increase in the health budget.

Nothing is going to happen during the next six months to dislodge Labour's considerable lead. david.walker@theguardian.com",

      "body": "<p><strong> Why is the west nervous about oil prices?</strong> </p> <p>President Clinton told the oil producers' cartel Opec last week that they risked killing off the world boom which is driving demand for oil if they did not increase output to reduce prices. Recessions have followed oil price shocks three times in recent economic history: in 1973, 1979 and 1990. The cartel's most powerful member, Saudi Arabia, is well aware that the current boom in prices could easily backfire if western economies crash which is why it persuaded fellow Opec members to open the taps. However, analysts think this is unlikely to get prices down below $30 a barrel. </p> <p><strong> Why is that?</strong> </p> <p>World demand for oil is very high because most big economies are enjoying healthy growth. The world economy expanded at its fastest pace in 10 years during the first quarter of 2000, at a time when Opec was reducing oil supplies after prices crashed as low as $10 a barrel during 1999. Strong demand and restricted supply resulted in prices peaking at a post-Gulf war high of $34.50 last week, despite three increases in production from Opec so far this year. This weekend's output increase will take some of the steam out of the market, but probably not enough to get prices down to $25 a barrel, which is the level the west would prefer. </p> <p><strong> Will high oil prices cause the world economy to crash this time?</strong> </p> <p>There are two schools of thought on this. Some analysts believe western economies are less oil-dependent than they were because advances in information and communications technology are the drivers of growth rather than energy-dependent industry, particularly in the US. It is true that economies such as the US and Britain which are dominated by the service sector rather than manufacturing need less oil to grow than they used to. The Economist estimates that rich economies use only about half as much oil for every dollar of GDP than they did in the early 1970s. That could be why investors until recently have been quite relaxed about oil prices. </p> <p><strong> And the other view?</strong> </p> <p>That higher oil prices lead to recession, sure as night follows day. The leading Cassandra in this school of thought is Professor Andrew Oswald from the University of Warwick. He believes that rising energy prices are the best predictor of a slump and is scornful about the claims of the new-economy school, arguing that the recovery in the world economy since the crisis in Asia three years ago owes much to the lower oil prices which prevailed then. He thinks it will take about 18 months for the tripling of oil prices seen since the start of 2000 begin to filter through into higher unemployment. </p> <p><strong> Are there any signs of a slowdown?</strong> </p> <p>Not yet in Britain. However, the west's leading economic think-tank, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, estimates that each sustained $10 increase in oil prices shaves 0.25% off growth in the west and adds 0.5% to inflation. The reaction of central banks to rising inflation will probably be critical in determining the outcomes for growth. </p> <p><strong> What have they done?</strong> </p> <p>In the US and Britain, central bankers have not acted despite rising fuel costs pushing up inflation in the manufacturing sector. The more hyperactive European Central Bank has pushed up borrowing costs, even though inflation in the eurozone in well below US levels. The key question for the bankers will be whether workers will demand higher wage increases to compensate for increased fuel costs. One recent estimate was that the average British family's petrol bill has increased by \u00a3400 since the beginning of the year. In the 1970s the boom was killed by wage earners demanding increases to compensate for rising prices, leading to a wage price spiral. Inflation is lower now than it was then and there is no evidence that outside the energy sector price pressures are getting out of hand. If central banks do not have to stamp down quite so firmly on the brakes this time then the west could continue to grow. However, the optimists who in the past predicted that the world economy would escape unscathed from an oil price shock have tended to be wrong.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The most striking thing about the wedding of Mike Baldwin and Linda Sykes in <strong> Coronation Street</strong> (ITV, Sun), not counting Rita's hat, Mike's second name turning out to be Vernon and the bunches of grapes on Linda's gown, was that it took place at all. Soap weddings mostly don't. A truism which The Vicar of Dibley exploited with joy at the wedding of Alive and Hugo: \"Stop! Stop! The groom is married to me. Sorry! Wrong church!\" </p> <p>Mike and Linda's nuptials, sponsored as is currently fashionable by a chocolate bar, went swimmingly. For a while. But as Al Read said (and I'd like to dig that man up and shake his hand for his perspicacity), \"There was enough said at our Edie's wedding.\" Home truths were not long coming. Mike's son kicked off. \"Do you know the biggest joke in the world? Me and your lovely wife here have been having an affair behind your back.\" Mike's furrowed brow furrowed further. He had paid for this lad's education. Surely that should be: \"I and your lovely wife here have been having an affair\"? </p> <p>The beauty of having a bit of brass and holding your wedding in Ye Olde Manchester Moated Grange is that you can have your row in a tasteful private suite instead of brawling in the street like normal people. Mike and Linda were not normal, as best man Roy Cropper pointed out in his memorable speech. Roy had been drafted in as a last-ditch replacement, as Mike's son, the original best man, was drinking his way through the minibar in the bridal suite. The violinist had long exhausted her limited repertoire. It was either Overhead The Moon Is Beaming again or it was Roy Cropper as best man. So it was Roy. </p> <p>Now Roy, if you haven't met him, is like George Washington, apart from the wooden teeth, of course. He cannot tell a lie. If the Queen turned up in Weatherfield with no clothes on, Roy would mention it with the kindest intentions. A man without guile is a walking bomb, so Roy's reassuring words to Mike were calculated to shake the stoutest heart. \"Just put your mind at rest. I've prepared a few reflections appropriate to the occasion.\" </p> <p>Roy's Appropriate Reflections, which should be collected in book form, went like this. \"I can't say I know Mike that well at all or, indeed, his good lady wife, but I do know that their romance hasn't always met with universal approval. Not only is there the obvious difference in their ages but also because, when their relationship began, he was the successful, well-to-do businessman and she was the lowly factory machinist.\" </p> <p>Or, as they would put it in the Rovers, Baldwin's wed a bloodsucker in suspenders. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Jim McDonald, who has done so much for the image of Northern Ireland, was putting the local villain in intensive care. A creditable effort, in its way, for a man who, quite recently, was paraplegic. Prison will be a livelier place with Jim in it. He could always be relied upon to make a public bonfire of an ex-girlfriend's goods or flatten anything vertical that looked at him sideways. A good hearted man, if you stood well back. He reminds me very much of Convict 99, who frequented my parents' pub. When I just missed meningitis - in those days you didn't get things, you just missed them - my mother told him to run and get the doctor. Convict 99 burst into the surgery as the doctor was applying his cold stethoscope to the first chest of the day and was told to wait his turn. The doctor arrived almost immediately with a stethoscope tied round his neck and had to be revived with brandy.

      "bodyText": "The most striking thing about the wedding of Mike Baldwin and Linda Sykes in Coronation Street (ITV, Sun), not counting Rita's hat, Mike's second name turning out to be Vernon and the bunches of grapes on Linda's gown, was that it took place at all. Soap weddings mostly don't. A truism which The Vicar of Dibley exploited with joy at the wedding of Alive and Hugo: \"Stop! Stop! The groom is married to me. Sorry! Wrong church!\" Mike and Linda's nuptials, sponsored as is currently fashionable by a chocolate bar, went swimmingly. For a while. But as Al Read said (and I'd like to dig that man up and shake his hand for his perspicacity), \"There was enough said at our Edie's wedding.\" Home truths were not long coming. Mike's son kicked off. \"Do you know the biggest joke in the world? Me and your lovely wife here have been having an affair behind your back.\" Mike's furrowed brow furrowed further. He had paid for this lad's education. Surely that should be: \"I and your lovely wife here have been having an affair\"? The beauty of having a bit of brass and holding your wedding in Ye Olde Manchester Moated Grange is that you can have your row in a tasteful private suite instead of brawling in the street like normal people. Mike and Linda were not normal, as best man Roy Cropper pointed out in his memorable speech. Roy had been drafted in as a last-ditch replacement, as Mike's son, the original best man, was drinking his way through the minibar in the bridal suite. The violinist had long exhausted her limited repertoire. It was either Overhead The Moon Is Beaming again or it was Roy Cropper as best man. So it was Roy. Now Roy, if you haven't met him, is like George Washington, apart from the wooden teeth, of course. He cannot tell a lie. If the Queen turned up in Weatherfield with no clothes on, Roy would mention it with the kindest intentions. A man without guile is a walking bomb, so Roy's reassuring words to Mike were calculated to shake the stoutest heart. \"Just put your mind at rest. I've prepared a few reflections appropriate to the occasion.\" Roy's Appropriate Reflections, which should be collected in book form, went like this. \"I can't say I know Mike that well at all or, indeed, his good lady wife, but I do know that their romance hasn't always met with universal approval. Not only is there the obvious difference in their ages but also because, when their relationship began, he was the successful, well-to-do businessman and she was the lowly factory machinist.\" Or, as they would put it in the Rovers, Baldwin's wed a bloodsucker in suspenders. Meanwhile, Jim McDonald, who has done so much for the image of Northern Ireland, was putting the local villain in intensive care. A creditable effort, in its way, for a man who, quite recently, was paraplegic. Prison will be a livelier place with Jim in it. He could always be relied upon to make a public bonfire of an ex-girlfriend's goods or flatten anything vertical that looked at him sideways. A good hearted man, if you stood well back. He reminds me very much of Convict 99, who frequented my parents' pub. When I just missed meningitis - in those days you didn't get things, you just missed them - my mother told him to run and get the doctor. Convict 99 burst into the surgery as the doctor was applying his cold stethoscope to the first chest of the day and was told to wait his turn. The doctor arrived almost immediately with a stethoscope tied round his neck and had to be revived with brandy. Convict 99 strolled in later to finish his pint. On Sunday, in the great autumn ratings race, BBC 1 entered Joanna Trollope's Other People's Children , a good-looking entry with a scene-stealing performance from Leslie Manville as an incandescently angry deserted wife. Sky One ran The Sight , a quirky Anglo-American entry with Andrew McCarthy as an amateur detective who could see ghosts. ITV scratched.

The symphony - for so long the symbol of anti-fascist resistance - has now taken on the connotations of liberation from communism as well.

However, variable quality is always the peril when you band together a group of soloists. The Leningrad Symphony was superlative in its rage, terror, grief and exultation, but Debussy's La Mer, which preceded it, had more than its fair share of problems. Some of the playing was scrappy, as if we were listening to a trial run. Gergiev doesn't have the full measure of the score: textures are hard and glacial rather than sensual.

It marked Andrew Davis's departure from the BBC Symphony Orchestra, which he has led for 13 years, and the pain of farewell was in the air. </p> <p>The first half brought the \"youth and music\" theme of this year's Proms to an ambivalent close. The imperious 20-year-old Hilary Hahn played the 19-year-old Mozart's Fourth Violin Concerto with a distinct lack of warmth, interpolating cadenzas that seemed to have strayed from Sibelius. Strauss's Salome, opera's 16-year-old necrophiliac, shed her orchestral veils with something less than depravity, before Jane Eaglen voiced her final scene with steely tone. Eaglen seemed happier when she had mutated into Britannia. Flinging quotes from Wagner into the melee, her voice cleaved the air with Baroque extravagance. </p> <p>Shostakovich surfaced once more in the form of the strangely titled (Lost) 2nd Jazz Suite. This is not the famous effort to which Nicole Kidman stripped in Eyes Wide Shut, but a reconstruction from sketches by Gerard McBurney of a piece written in 1938 for Stalin's State Jazz Orchestra. Shostakovich re-used some of the music in his searing Eighth Symphony; hearing themes we associate with monumental despair accompanied by a bluesy walking bass was unnerving. </p> <p>When it was nearly all over, Davis replaced his traditional speech with song, bursting into a variant of General Stanley's patter from HMS Pinafore - \"This is the very model of a modern music festival\" - including a wry dig at his successor Leonard Slatkin, whose remarks about the sartorial recklessness of female musicians have caused controversy. </p> <p>The Promenaders gave him a signed score of Britten's The Rape of Lucretia, before Nicholas Kenyon arrived to present him with the manuscript sketches of Elgar's Third Symphony, the world premiere of which was one of the triumphs of Davis's career.

But hear a few songs by this husband-and-wife team, and you imagine them hunting squirrels in the backwoods.

And the really horrible, dangerous and bloodthirsty side of it, like, 'Boy, that alligator ate that zebra in one bite!' I watch a lot of nature shows on TV where it's just all one big bloodbath.\" </p> <p>Rennie and husband Brett, who writes the music and sings most of the songs, are perhaps a little too morbid for mainstream American tastes. They have often been referred to as the Manson family or the Addams family by less kind reviewers who fail to see the beauty in Rennie's macabre lyrics. </p> <p>Their previous CD, Through the Trees (1998), was the darkest recording to come out of the US this side of death metal. It opened with a track featuring the downbeat chorus: \"This is why people OD on pills and jump from the Golden Gate Bridge\" and closed with the true story of Brett's stay in a mental hospital, with him strapped to a bed quoting Nietzsche. In 1995, during the recording of their second CD, Milk and Scissors, Brett's manic depression had taken such a hold that Rennie was forced to check him in to the hospital for his own protection. He was spending wildly, drinking heavily and had taken to eating cat food. </p> <p>\"I was delusional,\" he says. \"Incapable of getting anything done. I really thought I was the Messiah. I was writing my own bible and starting fires in the apartment. I was a fucking lunatic. I would go two weeks at a time without sleeping, I was down to about 145lb. So I went to the nut-house for a few weeks. They put me on lithium, among other things. Long-term lithium, which I am still taking to this day.\" Rennie has also had her own share of problems with depression and thoughts of suicide and, like Brett, is still taking the pills. Religion seems to loom large over the work of the Handsome Family. Brett was brought up a southern Baptist, and it was in church that he learned about music and how to sing in such a delightfully doomy baritone. He has also been influenced by the Louvin Brothers, a 50s Christian country act whose cautionary tales were every bit as dark as the Handsome Family's. </p> <p>Rennie was brought up a Jew in New York but has also dabbled with some less than orthodox spiritual beliefs, as revelealed in the lyrics for When That Helicopter Comes - the story of the second coming, with helicopters taking the place of Jesus. \"I've always been obsessed with helicopters,\" she says. \"When I was little I thought God was a helicopter. I had all these feelings that after I died I would turn into a helicopter.\" </p> <p>It is surprising to learn that lurking behind the rolling hills and falling trees of In the Air is the latest in technology. The couple may have recorded the album in their living room, but it was all done on a Macintosh G3 computer - hardly a traditional piece of country kit. But then, neither was the drum machine that regimented their previous album and was intended to alienate traditionalists in the alt.country scene. \"It was completely out of spite,\" says Brett. \"Musically it did work, but I thought that people would be really critical of it.

Jon Langford seems to be at the centre of any drunken guitar-led stomp worthy of mention with his various bands, such as the Waco Brothers, who evoke the spirit of Johnny Cash before he was born again. </p> <p>The morality tales of Rennie's lyrics are not lost on Brett, who at least seems to have learned to go a little steady on the drink. \"My classic joke is that if I get drunk and act like an asshole, then Rennie's going to write a song about it and I'm going to have to sing it over and over,\" he says. \"My punishment is having her pull my spiritual trousers down every night.\" </p> <p>\u0095 The Handsome Family play the Charlotte, Leicester (0116-255 3956), tonight; Maguires, Leeds (0113-245 5630), tomorrow; the Louisana, Bristol (0117-926 5978), on Wednesday, then tour.</p>",

It is, in fact, a strong material, but, sadly, given the wet climate of north Wales, the columns must be protected from the elements by glass-and-timber walls. \"They would disintegrate in the rain,\" Borer points out - which is why mud buildings are rare in damp old Britain, but common in north Africa. </p> <p>These rammed-earth columns offer us not just a pleasant sight, but a building material that uses substantially less energy to make than their concrete equivalent. \"The carbon dioxide emissions of the concrete industry are very high,\" says Borer. \"Cat aims to show how we can build using as little energy as possible.\" </p> <p>The question often asked about low-energy architecture is whether it has to be worthy, shaggy and, well, primitive? The answer, judging by the new building at Cat, is a qualified no. Yes, it is a bit shaggy, but then this is in keeping with the spirit of Cat, and, by the way, no insult. Perched high on an ancient slate hillside between Dolgellau and Machynlleth, Cat has integrity and intelligence. The new building sits by the entrance to the centre, which is accessed by a water-powered funicular that travels up from a car park to a kind of Welsh version of a Japanese temple. Like Clough William-Ellis's fantasy village Portmeirion a few miles away on Tremadog Bay, this is a magical place. The buildings are low-key, yet each is a delight. Apart from the new information centre, there's an earth toilet, a solar-powered telephone kiosk, an underground gallery aimed at showing how creepy-crawlies live and a remarkably grand theatre designed and built by Borer and Co last year for \u00a323,000 (put that in your Dome and count the cost). </p> <p>These are linked by muddy paths criss-crossed by dragonflies and birds. Between the buildings, there are examples of low-energy machines, which you can try out for yourself. There are also utterly uncondescending exhibits of building materials and ways of heating water and flushing (or not flushing) toilets. In fact, the place is filled with information about how to design and build in ways that make you want to set fire to every crass new executive housing estate - except that would cause pollution. </p> <p>The roof of Borer's latest building is also fitted with solar panels. The energy produced not only heats the information centre itself, but can also produce a surplus. \"The roof can generate 50kW at any one time,\" says Borer. \"That's enough to light up the bars of 50 electric fires. When the building itself doesn't need the energy, the hot water can be pumped to other buildings around the Cat site.\" </p> <p>Can the rest of us learn new (or very old) tricks from Cat? Yes. The new bookshop and information centre may not be to everyone's taste.

Joe Roby, DLJ's chief executive, is to be paid a one-off retention award of $18m in shares once the $11.5bn acquisition is completed later this year as well as a guaranteed bonus and salary adding up to almost $50m over the next three years.</p> <p>Mr Roby, who earned $20.7m last year, is to become chairman of the combined group's investment banking business. The 60-year-old's package, filed as part of the merger agreement to the securities and exchange commission, also includes a continued \"consulting fee\" for three years after he leaves the company.</p> <p>Credit Suisse has set aside an additional $1.2bn to retain the staff it wants to keep. The group has already said that there will be few redundancies in the corporate finance and fixed income departments out of a total of more than 2,000 job cuts in the US and Europe.</p> <p>Support staff are expected to bear the brunt of the cuts, followed by equity research analysts and traders in New York and London.</p> <p>Where there is no clear difference between two sector analysts at CSFB and DLJ, senior executives have admitted that the job would most likely go to the acquiring bank's staff.</p> <p>Hector Sants, who has built DLJ's international equity operation from scratch over the past two years, oversees more than 200 professionals in London. His counterpart at CSFB manages more than 500 people.</p> <p>CSFB's ambitions to enter the global super league of companies in the bulge bracket -firms which have cashed in on mergers and acquisitions by acting for both parties involved - are likely to mean that some effort will be expended in trying to keep highly rated members of staff at DLJ, including Mr Sants.</p> <p>European executives are understood to want to adopt an \"orderly\" approach to the lay-offs, citing employment legislation for a relatively \"softly, softly\" approach.</p> <p>A bigger challenge may be trying to retain the bankers who relished DLJ's boutique-style of operation. Insiders say that many of the close-knit teams working in the City for DLJ are not happy about the prospect of moving to the larger firm, which is based in Canary Wharf.</p> <p>No decision has yet been taken on what will happen to DLJ's headquarters, however.</p> <p>The most senior investment banking jobs have already been announced.</p> <p>Hamilton James, a senior banker at DLJ, will become co-head of global investment banking at the combined firm, for which he will be granted a retention award of $13.3m in Credit Suisse shares.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of people working for Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette in Britain will be told whether they still have a job over the next few days following the US investment bank's takeover by Credit Suisse. Department heads face the task of wielding the axe as details emerge of the bonuses being paid to the bank's most senior executives. Joe Roby, DLJ's chief executive, is to be paid a one-off retention award of $18m in shares once the $11.5bn acquisition is completed later this year as well as a guaranteed bonus and salary adding up to almost $50m over the next three years. Mr Roby, who earned $20.7m last year, is to become chairman of the combined group's investment banking business. The 60-year-old's package, filed as part of the merger agreement to the securities and exchange commission, also includes a continued \"consulting fee\" for three years after he leaves the company. Credit Suisse has set aside an additional $1.2bn to retain the staff it wants to keep. The group has already said that there will be few redundancies in the corporate finance and fixed income departments out of a total of more than 2,000 job cuts in the US and Europe. Support staff are expected to bear the brunt of the cuts, followed by equity research analysts and traders in New York and London. Where there is no clear difference between two sector analysts at CSFB and DLJ, senior executives have admitted that the job would most likely go to the acquiring bank's staff. Hector Sants, who has built DLJ's international equity operation from scratch over the past two years, oversees more than 200 professionals in London. His counterpart at CSFB manages more than 500 people. CSFB's ambitions to enter the global super league of companies in the bulge bracket -firms which have cashed in on mergers and acquisitions by acting for both parties involved - are likely to mean that some effort will be expended in trying to keep highly rated members of staff at DLJ, including Mr Sants. European executives are understood to want to adopt an \"orderly\" approach to the lay-offs, citing employment legislation for a relatively \"softly, softly\" approach. A bigger challenge may be trying to retain the bankers who relished DLJ's boutique-style of operation. Insiders say that many of the close-knit teams working in the City for DLJ are not happy about the prospect of moving to the larger firm, which is based in Canary Wharf. No decision has yet been taken on what will happen to DLJ's headquarters, however. The most senior investment banking jobs have already been announced. Hamilton James, a senior banker at DLJ, will become co-head of global investment banking at the combined firm, for which he will be granted a retention award of $13.3m in Credit Suisse shares.",

      "bodyText": "If people want moral uplift, Harold Macmillan used to say, they should look to their bishops. But our own pious prime minister in New York last week, as he privately approved the Sierra Leone hostage rescue assault plan, was publicly propounding morality as a basis for policy: it is the west's duty to combat \"bad governance\" in Africa. He might have stopped to reflect that politicians who claim the moral high ground usually get what they deserve. His government has been here before, living to regret the phrase \"ethical foreign policy\". A party document on foreign policy to be launched at conference no longer makes Robin Cook's boast that Labour would \"make Britain once again a force for good in the world\". Since the election, Mr Cook has learned about the difficulties of a country which is a large arms manufacturer claiming to act as a force for good. In opposition, Labour made humanitarian noises about the wickedness of selling arms to repressive regimes. In office, the problem was again discovered about what happens when moralism comes up against the word \"jobs\". The new document promises \"a more responsible arms trade\", but this is humbug. One might as well speak of a more responsible slave trade. There are really only two honest arms policies.

Look at the movies constructed out of real events,\" the producer of Confessions, Richard Kroehling, said. He said his programme was \"very well executed\".",

But this requires measures wider than the proposal by the European Commission for rights to information and consultation in enterprises with 50 employees or more.</p> <p>In many European countries, unions have legally protected rights of access to the workforce. In Britain, a right to general access is confined to the period before a ballot in the recognition procedures of the 1999 legislation.</p> <p>Many unions are also able to sue in the courts on behalf of their members' collective interests. In Britain, employees must enforce employment protection rights by individualised claims.</p> <p>In Germany and France, the employer must make a \"social plan\" providing for compensation to workers because of regrading and other changes. The German version must be agreed between the works council and employer, or is imposed by bipartite arbitration if they cannot agree. In France, collective dismissals effected in the absence of a \"social plan\" are null and void, and workers in such cases must be immediately reinstated. Here, even in cases of unfair dismissal reinstatement is a rare remedy.</p> <p>For a modern system of protection of workers, we must still look to national systems of law and collective bargaining.

      "bodyText": "The TUC wants to bring its \"social partnership\" up to levels \"common throughout the rest of the EU\" (Morris warns TUC to beware euro danger, September 8). But this requires measures wider than the proposal by the European Commission for rights to information and consultation in enterprises with 50 employees or more. In many European countries, unions have legally protected rights of access to the workforce. In Britain, a right to general access is confined to the period before a ballot in the recognition procedures of the 1999 legislation. Many unions are also able to sue in the courts on behalf of their members' collective interests. In Britain, employees must enforce employment protection rights by individualised claims. In Germany and France, the employer must make a \"social plan\" providing for compensation to workers because of regrading and other changes. The German version must be agreed between the works council and employer, or is imposed by bipartite arbitration if they cannot agree. In France, collective dismissals effected in the absence of a \"social plan\" are null and void, and workers in such cases must be immediately reinstated. Here, even in cases of unfair dismissal reinstatement is a rare remedy. For a modern system of protection of workers, we must still look to national systems of law and collective bargaining. EU rights rarely go beyond rights to consultation. Lord Wedderburn \u0095 Trade unionists should consider breaking with New Labour when it comes to the use of their union's political levy. Ordinary members of trade unions have little or no say over how their political levy is used. This issue is even more important when one considers the present government's record on the minimum wage and privatisation and the way in which New Labour now funds itself with donations from big business.

Fellow Germans knew this key figure in European politics as the \"Napoleon from Saarland\", and when he stormed out of the German government in March 1999 it was front-page news around the world.</p> <p>Today, \"Red\" Oskar Lafontaine cuts a different figure. He spends his time writing articles, reading German classics, and picking mushrooms in the woods around his home.</p> <p>Mr Lafontaine was in reflective mood as he talked in his house in Saarbr\u00fccken near the French border. Though speculation about a comeback has been rife in Germany since April when he made a public apology to his colleagues in the Social Democratic Party (SPD), he told the Guardian he is not looking back. In his first interview with a British newspaper since he quit, he said he could see no point in re-entering politics while so few of his party colleagues -\"I would say 30, 40%\" - shared his doubts about the \"Third Way\" course being steered by chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der.</p> <p>\"A comeback in the present situation is unimaginable,\" he said. \"I do not know what I shall be doing in 10 years, but for the moment my decision is clear.\"</p> <p>Another factor was his profoundly gloomy assessment of the prospects of applying leftwing policies in the current international setting.</p> <p>\"Without a new architecture for international financial markets, it is not possible to practise social democracy,\" he said flatly. \"The international financial markets have become a machine for redistributing wealth from the poor to the rich.

      "bodyText": "The Sun dubbed him \"The Most Dangerous Man in Europe\". Fellow Germans knew this key figure in European politics as the \"Napoleon from Saarland\", and when he stormed out of the German government in March 1999 it was front-page news around the world. Today, \"Red\" Oskar Lafontaine cuts a different figure. He spends his time writing articles, reading German classics, and picking mushrooms in the woods around his home. Mr Lafontaine was in reflective mood as he talked in his house in Saarbr\u00fccken near the French border. Though speculation about a comeback has been rife in Germany since April when he made a public apology to his colleagues in the Social Democratic Party (SPD), he told the Guardian he is not looking back. In his first interview with a British newspaper since he quit, he said he could see no point in re-entering politics while so few of his party colleagues -\"I would say 30, 40%\" - shared his doubts about the \"Third Way\" course being steered by chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der. \"A comeback in the present situation is unimaginable,\" he said. \"I do not know what I shall be doing in 10 years, but for the moment my decision is clear.\" Another factor was his profoundly gloomy assessment of the prospects of applying leftwing policies in the current international setting. \"Without a new architecture for international financial markets, it is not possible to practise social democracy,\" he said flatly. \"The international financial markets have become a machine for redistributing wealth from the poor to the rich. And social democracy is not to redistribute from the poor to the rich.\" Mr Lafontaine said the alternative was a Blairite \"Third Way\" programme that amounted to a \"pack of lies\". He himself had been able to in troduce only relatively minor changes while in government. Some degree of mystery continues to surround Mr Lafontaine's shock resignation last year from his job as finance minister. He says now that one factor behind the decision was a change he underwent after an assassination attempt 10 years ago. \"You have the experience that life can end. Today. In the next hour. You get a new feeling for life.

A 25-year-old engineer hanged himself from a tree near his parents' house after police impounded his car and charged him with exploiting the prostitute in the passenger seat. He had not broken any law and would not have been convicted. Police knew, however, that the news of his arrest would dominate gossip in his village of Colfesco, near Venice, where he had a girlfriend and family. The interior minister, Enzo Bianco, immediately distanced himself from the policy of naming and shaming and ordered an inquiry into the decision to arrest the man, named only as Antonello. \"I have never given a directive telling police to sequester the cars of clients,\" said Mr Bianco. The issue threatened to split the centre-left government after the prime minister, Giuliano Amato, said zero tolerance was necessary to combat Italy's soaring number of streetwalkers, estimated at 50,000. Prostitution is not a crime in Italy, but aiding and abetting prostitutes is, so several cities have started targeting clients with a law originally aimed at pimps. Police credit the tactic with dramatic reductions in kerb crawling. Lawyers are fighting to have it declared illegitimate and a violation of privacy. The village priest told mourners they had lost a decent young man who made a mistake and paid too high a price. Maurizio, a friend of Antonello, told reporters: \"They killed him.

Leaders of the Abu Sayyaf guerrillas said yesterday there was no timetable for the release of their four remaining hostages following a gun battle between rebel factions on Saturday that left at least three people dead.</p> <p>Those still being held are one Filipino - the only one of the original 21 people kidnapped on April 23 - two of three French journalists who were seized while covering the crisis, 12 evangelical Christian preachers taken when they went into the jungle to pray for the hostages and an American seized two weeks ago.</p> <p>But German Marc Wallert, Frenchman Stephane Loisy, and Finns Risto Vahanen and Seppo Franti, the last of the 10 westerners in the original group to be freed, spent yesterday savouring normal life.</p> <p>Once they had surfaced after a night of celebrating, Mr Loisy went scuba diving, which is what he was preparing to do when kidnapped from the Malaysian resort island of Sipadan on April 23. \"It feels like freedom,\" he said.</p> <p>The others spent most of the day lounging by the pool, reading about themselves in newspapers and toasting their freedom with red wine.</p> <p>\"We have had a lot of time to consider our lives, consider our values,\" Mr Vahanen, who owns an engineering firm, said. \"I think our lives will be changed after this.\" He was keen to get back to work. \"Anything will feel like a vacation after what we have been through.\"</p> <p>Mr Franti said drawing helped him through depression. \"I was very down. I drew and this helped me very much,\" he said. At one stage, he said, he was very close to suicide.</p> <p>Most of the hostages, including those released earlier, said the worst moments of their captivity were when they were twice caught in mortar and gunfire between the guerrillas and Philippine soldiers soon after they were captured.</p> <p>At one time while they had to dive out of the bamboo hut in which they were sheltering when a gun fight erupted. Mr Vahanen said they found the hut roof riddled with bullet holes when they went back to it.</p> <p>Mr Franti recounted that he vomited often from the smell of human waste and rotting food as the crisis dragged on and conditions deteriorated.</p> <p>Even though they said they could never forgive Abu Sayyaf for abducting them, the four blamed the Philippine government for causing the crisis.</p> <p>\"[They] can't neglect remote areas.\" Mr Vahanen said. They have to give similar chances to all people, no matter what their religion, no matter where they live. What we saw in Jolo was real poverty, and this kind of poverty is always the seed of this kind of guerrilla movement.\"</p> <p>As with the six westerners freed two weeks ago, the four men will fly home via Libya so that the Libyans, who paid the $4m (\u00a32.8m) that secured their release, can bask in their success. The Libyan negotiator Rajab Azzarouq insists that the money is for development projects, but it is clear the rebels are using much of it to buy new weapons and to attract recruits.</p> <p>Arguments over the distribution of the cash is believed to have caused the battle on Saturday. The senior Abu Sayyaf commander, Ghalib Andang, said yesterday that he could not release the remaining prisoners until he had dealt with the faction that rebelled against his leadership.</p> <p>A separate faction is holding the American Jeffrey Schilling. Yesterday it released a tape, which it claimed was an interview with him.\"Although I am kept in either chains or handcuffs, I am not mistreated,\" said the tape, broadcast on the Radio Mindanao network.</p> <p>\"Their negotiators are ready to compromise on their part. Use the Libyan government as negotiators and end my captivity as soon as possible.\"</p>",

Once they had surfaced after a night of celebrating, Mr Loisy went scuba diving, which is what he was preparing to do when kidnapped from the Malaysian resort island of Sipadan on April 23. \"It feels like freedom,\" he said. The others spent most of the day lounging by the pool, reading about themselves in newspapers and toasting their freedom with red wine. \"We have had a lot of time to consider our lives, consider our values,\" Mr Vahanen, who owns an engineering firm, said. \"I think our lives will be changed after this.\" He was keen to get back to work. \"Anything will feel like a vacation after what we have been through.\" Mr Franti said drawing helped him through depression. \"I was very down. I drew and this helped me very much,\" he said. At one stage, he said, he was very close to suicide. Most of the hostages, including those released earlier, said the worst moments of their captivity were when they were twice caught in mortar and gunfire between the guerrillas and Philippine soldiers soon after they were captured. At one time while they had to dive out of the bamboo hut in which they were sheltering when a gun fight erupted. Mr Vahanen said they found the hut roof riddled with bullet holes when they went back to it. Mr Franti recounted that he vomited often from the smell of human waste and rotting food as the crisis dragged on and conditions deteriorated. Even though they said they could never forgive Abu Sayyaf for abducting them, the four blamed the Philippine government for causing the crisis. \"[They] can't neglect remote areas.\" Mr Vahanen said. They have to give similar chances to all people, no matter what their religion, no matter where they live. What we saw in Jolo was real poverty, and this kind of poverty is always the seed of this kind of guerrilla movement.\" As with the six westerners freed two weeks ago, the four men will fly home via Libya so that the Libyans, who paid the $4m (\u00a32.8m) that secured their release, can bask in their success. The Libyan negotiator Rajab Azzarouq insists that the money is for development projects, but it is clear the rebels are using much of it to buy new weapons and to attract recruits. Arguments over the distribution of the cash is believed to have caused the battle on Saturday. The senior Abu Sayyaf commander, Ghalib Andang, said yesterday that he could not release the remaining prisoners until he had dealt with the faction that rebelled against his leadership. A separate faction is holding the American Jeffrey Schilling. Yesterday it released a tape, which it claimed was an interview with him.\"Although I am kept in either chains or handcuffs, I am not mistreated,\" said the tape, broadcast on the Radio Mindanao network. \"Their negotiators are ready to compromise on their part. Use the Libyan government as negotiators and end my captivity as soon as possible.\"",

      "body": "<p>Dot.com missionaries beware! What you are about to read is heresy. The counter-revolution is under way. Mucky \"old media\" is fighting back against the online upstarts and their predictions of a paperless world. </p> <p>Leading the Charge of the Print Brigade is Tony O'Reilly's Independent News &amp; Media (INM), which appears to have had second, and then third, thoughts about the commercial potential of new media. </p> <p>When presenting their interim results last week, the company's senior executives were making it abundantly clear that it is time to bring a sense of proportion to internet mania. </p> <p>Too much money has been wasted by too many companies on a hunch that people will eventually prefer to run their lives through their computers. Instead, after a gradual period of reassessment, INM has become convinced that newspapers have a great future. Turning on its head a bit of web jargon, papers therefore remain \"the ultimate browser\". </p> <p>Senior INM executives are less starry-eyed about those once-fashionable claims that \"the guy with the ponytail will steal our business\". After a think-tank weekend in Deauville recently, it became clear that newspapers, rather than the net, are to get the company's greatest attention. </p> <p>As in so many companies that spent millions on new media, its directors just can't see where the profits will come from. E-commerce has not taken off. Classified advertising hasn't vanished to the net. </p> <p>Gavin O'Reilly, who runs the company's Irish interests, is fond of telling an anecdote about taking a break on the Shannon with a friend who asked him to buy an English paper he doesn't normally read. Idly scanning the pages, his eye was drawn to an obituary of a viscount who had had a fascinating life. O'Reilly had never heard of the man and realised that the chances of his ever having had the pleasure of reading such a piece on the paper's website would have been virtually nil. </p> <p>It confirmed his growing view, one developing fast among others in the company who had, only a year ago, been convinced of the internet's primacy, that newspapers are far from dying. They are special and different and will be with us for as long as we can imagine. This philosophy now underlies much of INM's strategic thinking and will be given concrete expression in a couple of weeks' time when it announces a massive new investment in the paper that has cost it a fortune in the past three years: the Independent. </p> <p>No one at the company is prepared to disclose exactly what form the injection of \"millions\" will make, but I would guess that it means the introduction of new sections at the very least, in both the daily and its stablemate, the Independent on Sunday. It proves once again that Tony O'Reilly, now executive chairman of INM, is as dedicated as ever to Britain's lowest selling national titles. </p> <p>Since INM became the sole owner of the papers in 1997, having bought out Mirror group's portion after an unhappy joint ownership, it has spent \u00a37m on the editorial side alone and, so far, has not had a penny back from the persistent loss-maker. Now, though, there appears to be a spring to O'Reilly's step, and that of his UK chief executive Brendan Hopkins. The last vestiges of their links to the Mirror are finally being severed as the Independent titles move out of the Canary Wharf tower to their own Docklands headquarters. </p> <p>Hopkins predicts that, by next year, the titles will move into profit for the first time since those long-ago days in the late 80s when the paper was briefly fashionable. Well, he would say that, wouldn't he? But INM's six-monthly figures do appear to confirm his forecast. The UK operation, which combines the Independent titles with groups of smallish suburban papers in Greater London and Kent, managed to turn in a profit of some \u00a3100,000, a tiny return on a turnover of \u00a351m, but a move in the right direction. </p> <p>I understand that the move from the Wharf may well cut \u00a35m from the bottom line, so it's easy to see why Hopkins is so confident. By the time the annual results are announced next spring, INM's UK arm will also be boosted by revenue from its most recent \u00a3300m purchase of the Belfast Telegraph group, a sale forced on Trinity-Mirror by the competition commission. In fact, a comparison between the current fortunes of Trinity-Mirror and INM shows how the balance has moved in the latter's favour. Before Philip Graf's regional outfit, Trinity, merged with the Mirror each of them was greater in size than INM. Now INM is larger than the merged Trinity-Mirror unit. </p> <p>The reason, of course, is INM's global status. O'Reilly has built an international media company with a market capitalisation of \u00a31.3bn, assets of \u00a32bn and a turnover in excess of \u00a31bn. It is the leading newspaper publisher in Ireland, South Africa and New Zealand, the leading regional publisher in Australia and even has a large interest in two of the top three papers in Portugal. It is also an important radio broadcaster in most of those countries and, in Ireland, could be on the verge of the big time with its cable operation. </p> <p>Its Irish newspapers will be printed from November on new presses in a \u00a340m state-of-the-art printing plant on the outskirts of Dublin. It will run with almost half the former staffing in the old works after a lengthy and complex negotiation with the unions that culminated in a voluntary redundancy agreement. </p> <p>O'Reilly scorned the idea of \"doing a Wapping\" in Dublin to achieve staff cuts. \"He has known those guys in the press hall for years,\" said an executive who would have preferred a swifter resolution in the Murdoch mould. \"He just wouldn't countenance confrontation.\" </p> <p>Before we get too carried away with the O'Reilly phenomenon, and all those mind-boggling figures with their endless noughts and double-digit earnings growth, let's come back to earth in Britain for a moment. </p> <p>There is little doubt that INM has the capacity to have withstood losses at the Independent titles, and could do so again. It's heartening for its journalists, many of whom have gloomily watched the papers career from crisis to crisis in the past decade, to know O'Reilly is in for the long game. </p> <p>But is the Independent really viable? It was noticeable that after last week's INM press conference even the Financial Times, which is surely supposed to scrutinise company claims, reported that the Independent titles are \"enjoying improved circulation\". </p> <p>With respect, that gives a whole new meaning to the word \"improvement\". Here are the facts: the Independent in August last year sold 222,200 copies. This August it sold 223,608. So it improved by 1,408, less than 1%. Similarly, the Independent on Sunday managed to improve by just 1,844 copies, also less than 1% over the 12 months. </p> <p>But that isn't the end of the story. In August last year, the Independent's total included bulk sales - those giveaways that are so helpful when massaging statistics - of 32,168. This year the bulks were 33,765, a rise of 1,597 copies. In other words, in real terms, the Independent sales haven't improved at all. </p> <p>When we turn to the Independent on Sunday (Sindy), the truth is even more stark, the polar opposite of claims of improved circulation. In August last year the Sindy reported bulk sales of 21,805. This August, bulks had risen to 36,288. So its real sale, the bit that can't be boosted by shoving out more quires to an airport lounge, has gone down by a considerable amount - about 7% over the year. </p> <p>Okay, so I've caught INM out. I could probably have done the same to the Guardian and the Observer, but they aren't boasting to City analysts about improved sales. INM is hardly the first newspaper company to put a gloss on sales figures and, credit where credit is due, under editor-in-chief Simon Kelner the titles have performed much better than in the past. There is a greater coherence about them and some of the writers, such as Donald MacIntyre, David Aaronovitch and John Walsh, command attention. </p> <p>Clearly, INM knows the true situation, and that hasn't inhibited its decision to plough back yet more into the papers. Despite the sales figures, the latest readership statistics from NRS offer a sunnier view. The Independent is reported to have attracted 15% more people in the 15-44 age bracket while both the Times and Daily Telegraph have suffered losses - of 13% and 24% respectively. </p> <p>Kelner also points to another ray of sunshine: \"Our market share of full-rate sales is growing and has done so for the past seven months.\" </p> <p>That's fine. But the Independent's difficulty in winning sales reminds us that all papers are finding the market very tough indeed just now. So INM's corporate decision to throw its weight behind newspapers at this time is an astonishing act of faith.</p>",

Rationally, he pointed out that it isn't anything like as relevant as comparing the month this year with the same month the previous year. With monthly fluctuations due, for example, to holiday periods, the start of the football season, and the occasional five-week month followed by a four-weeker, it's difficult to get a full and broad picture. </p> <p>I regularly make the year-on-year comparisons within my articles, so why not publish the full set of figures? Well, one important reason is that the current way of presenting figures does help to show rapid ups and downs. Even taking into account the specific reasons listed above, it provides the most up-to-date picture. </p> <p>Similarly, in making year-on-year comparisons, as editors inevitably point out to me, it is easy to overlook the fact that 12 months ago a particular paper had a promotion which boosted its sales - and perhaps depressed those of its rivals - which hasn't been repeated. So, once again, apples haven't been compared to apples. Needless to say, editors tend to latch on to any positive twist, no matter how arcane, to suggest that their circulation is better than before, using the previous month, the month last year, the six-monthly figures, market share, the full-rate sale and so on. </p> <p>I just wish there was room to put in all sorts of figures, especially those controversial bulk and foreign sales, along with the hundreds of thousands of subscription and discounted copies. Anyway, having said all that, I have come round to the idea of changing the chart to the year-on-year sale, putting up with complaints that I seem to have forgotten that paper X ran a win-a-house competition last time around. So, from next month, the chart will change. </p> <p>Meanwhile, back to this month's sales. Among the tabloids, the Sun enjoyed a very good August, due to the clever juxtaposition of its millionaire contest, its cleavage froth and the start of the football season. For the moment at least, the Sun and Daily Star appear to have halted the Mirror's revival in its tracks. Among the broadsheets, whose readers generally spend most of their Augusts abroad, it was a flat month. Except, of course, north of the border where the Scotsman leapt back over 100,000. Whatever critics say about publisher Andrew Neil and editor Rebecca Hardy - and they do make an awful lot of unflattering remarks about them - they have fulfilled their sales boasts. </p> <p>Yes, the paper is cheap at 20p. But it looks as though the company is committed to maintaining it at that price and the opposition would do well to contemplate what happened when the Times more than doubled its sale after price-cutting. Rivals tended to do too little too late. If the Glasgow-based Herald is going to compete, it has to prevent the Scotsman's new readers from building the habit of buying its old competitor. </p> <p>Turning to the Sunday titles, it is clear that the News of the World's name-and-shame campaign has done its sale no harm.

In declaring that \"the masthead will remain as it is\", however, the trade weekly overlooked a symbolically important change: the Telegraph's \"flannel panel\" - photos and 'trails' promoting the attractions inside the paper - will now appear above, not below, the words \"The Daily Telegraph\" and space has been freed for extra faces alongside the title. This differentiates it sharply from the Times, although both papers already put their flannel panel above the title on Saturdays. </p> <p>How did we reach the point where moving a flannel panel, not acquiring new writers, is at the centre of a quality paper's autumn offensive? And how did the broadsheets, once so hostile to the cult of personality, come to outstrip the tabloids in their enthusiasm for hacks' faces? </p> <p>Thirty years ago, after all, things were very different. Tabloids then readily used picture bylines (henceforward 'pb's), but observed strict rules, only dishing them out to star writers or other reader magnets: chief political commentator, obligatory humorist, chief sportswriter, female figurehead - Marje Proops, Jean Rook, Lynda Lee-Potter - and maybe the astrologer. Broadsheets, whose pages then consisted of almost unbroken text, expressed their seriousness by keeping their named contributors as faceless as leader writers. If egos or inter-paper rivalry required a pb, caricatures were preferred to photos. </p> <p>These rules began to change in the first half of the 1980s, when the tabloids, led by the Sun, sought to use grinning mugshots to manufacture personalities rather than just reward Fleet Street's accepted aristocracy with stand-out status on the page commensurate with their salaries.Part of the same pattern was an increase in stories in which tabloid journalists become leading characters instead of invisible observers - when \"our Sally\" tried out a diet or tested the impact of a new bra on men in the street, while \"our Kevin\" described his problems in getting a plumber. Hence many more hacks were now photographed, but the implicit message of these photographs was still the same: \"this paper is written by people who look - and think - just like you\". </p> <p>The broadsheets, meanwhile, sniffily set about making grudging accommodations with this mystifying fascination with journalists' looks, although the two cultures still remained firmly separate. By the early 80s, for instance, columnists Hugo Young, Peter Jenkins and Polly Toynbee were deemed worthy of depiction in the Guardian - albeit via what seemed to be crude photocopies of their photos. </p> <p>After 1986, however, the Wapping revolution set in train forces - the widespread adoption of new technology and multi-section papers - which overturned the pre-existing tabloid/ broadsheet relationship. By the early 90s, the proliferation of extra sections made broadsheets just as likely to show contributors' faces: often tabloid anyway, these sections were free to make up their own rules, and far more likely to be filled with mugshots than the main news section. And because the overall pagination of broadsheets was much larger, some eventually overhauled tabloids in number of pbs. Until very recently, whether these faces were attractive mattered little. Tabloids wanted their hacks to look ordinary, broadsheets wanted theirs to look thoughtful. But the emergence of flannel panels put an end to such nonchalance. </p> <p>To compete with other papers on news-stands where rival panels can be compared demanded at least two alluring faces per day, preferably smiling - and the presence of models, actors or attractive media and sports stars can not always be justified. Often journalists had to become the front-page lure, such as the Times's finance expert Anne Ashworth or the Independent's sports columnist Gabby Yorath. Escalating this battle of the beauties, the Telegraph now slyly resorts to using photos of mod els on its panels to trail articles penned by women who presumably don't meet its aesthetic criteria . </p> <p>The rise of the flannel panel - driven by the broadsheets, as the tabloids lack the necessary free space around their mastheads - has made papers generally more looks-conscious, with countless journalists undergoing makeovers which make them look fun-loving rather than frowning and forbidding. The Telegraph expensively re-photographed all its regular contributors, enabling some apparently to shed 20 years . </p> <p>The message of all these faces is quite different from that of the tabloid pbs of the 70s. They say: \"Look how many smiley, young, glamorous people we've got writing for us, as well as the middle-aged blokes you know about! Some you will fancy; others will mirror your own amused, bemused or irate perspective on the world.\" </p> <p>So the 2000s have begun with the media which once cherished the invisibility of their contributors - newspapers and radio - eagerly displaying their faces so that they become as recognisable as TV reporters. And meanwhile television is increasingly sucking in print journalists. It's as if old media are huddling closer together for comfort, terrified of the internet, the medium of the new century which threatens to engulf them. </p> <p>But, perhaps because it was originally created by nerds, the culture of the internet allows the authors of texts (whether emails or contributions to websites) to enjoy invisibility. Like the quality press before the multi-section and flannel panel revolutions, webzines happily let lengthy articles unfurl without feeling any need to put a mugshot at the top of them. </p> <p>Ironically, in its preference for leaving writers faceless, the information medium of the future returns full circle to the broadsheet ethos of the 1970s.

Monkey was delighted to note at the do for new women's mag Bare that the previous daggers-drawn hostilities in the world of female publishing must have ceased. For, and surely this must have been in tribute to its honoured rival, the drinks being served were Cosmopolitans.",

      "body": "<p>In his quiet, intense voice, David Liddiment, ITV Network programme director, says: \"Our performance is not as good as I would have liked. But there are still four months of the year left. It's not over yet. This is a very important season.\" </p> <p>Though the plight of his rival Peter Salmon, controller of BBC1, is grabbing headlines, ITV is in difficulty too. Each network targets the mass market. They study each other's schedules like hawks. Both are having an annus horribilis as pay television relentlessly gains share and competition from all quarters increases. </p> <p>So, when Merrill Lynch weighed in with a report last week, saying that poor viewing figures and lacklustre advertising revenue could trigger ITV's terminal decline - a verdict underpinned by the news that the previous week had seen the network record its lowest share ever (25.7%) - it set nerves jangling. And especially since BBC1 may be about to bounce up from the floor with a massive spending boost. </p> <p>\"We are concerned; we want a healthy commercial television sector, and that is difficult if the brand leader isn't healthy,\" says Nick Phillips, director general of the ad agencies' trade body, the IPA. He has put out feelers, asking ITV's top executives from Granada Media's Charles Allen downwards to attend a summit with top agencies and media buyers later this month. </p> <p>The call for dialogue comes because the ITV Network is still without a chief executive, despite a sky-high salary on offer of \u00a3500,000 a year. A key issue is that ITV has missed its peak time (7pm-10.30pm) audience targets of 38.5%, set with advertiser approval. The running total of peak time share over eight months is 36.7%, and the trend in August was down again (34.7%), worse than July. The targets were dreamt up three years ago by former chief executive \"Saint\" Richard Eyre to break a mindset resigned to inexorable decline. But could such aspirations be a thing of the past? </p> <p>Zenith Media, key power brokers because they buy slots for big advertisers, are now predicting that specific targets will be abandoned after December, to end ITV's embarrassment. Instead, only the gap which ITV still maintains over BBC1 in peaktime will be publicised. </p> <p>This is not academic. The move of BBC1 news to 10pm, freeing up the network to compete head-to-head with ITV at 9 pm for the first time in 30 years, is putting the fear of God into the sector. Some think that BBC1 might even put on audience share. \"We want that gap of superiority over BBC1,\" says Phillips. \"We want to hack chunks out of BBC1,\" says Bob Wootton, director of media and advertising affairs at the advertisers' association ISBA. \"If Dyke reflates BBC1, then it will be a major headache, a migraine for ITV. Dyke has the autonomous power to move money and the schedule around.\" </p> <p>So, is ITV abandoning targets? \"That's hugely premature,\" says Liddiment. \"We've had no conversations internally about that. You've got to go back, to remember why they were first set in place. ITV was serious about taking hold of things, squeezing the maximum performance from the channel.\" Liddiment, at heart an innovative programme-maker, also faces a more wounding criticism. The view is ingrained that ratings slippage has led ITV to eschew risks and leave others to innovate in the autumn schedule, so reflecting the decline in morale and self confidence critics identify. Big Brother is a sensation - but on Channel 4. BBC1 was first to revive daytime soaps, with Doctors. ITV is responding with Emmerdale stripped five nights a week, and Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? every week this autumn. </p> <p>Liddiment points to these and Fat Friends, Kay Mellor's drama about a slimming club, as bold strokes, when asked if he's playing safe. \"I don't think so. But we're operating a big, popular channel, aiming for huge audiences, and at all times we have to balance the level of risks we take. \"When the risks don't take off the downside is . . .\" he trails off, perhaps remembering his doomed high profile failure to revive the sitcom with Carsey-Werner's Days Like These. Nick Elliott, ITV's controller of drama, confirms the policy is for longer US-style runs of series that work - Peak Practice, Where the Heart Is, The Bill - broken up by occasional specials and two-parters. All different from three years ago. </p> <p>At a Guardian Edinburgh International Television Festival session where advertisers listed programmes from heaven and hell, ITV had the largest clutch of downwardly-mobile offerings, with persistent mentions of stalwarts such as London's Burning and Blind Date joining the more predictable Wheel of Fortune, You've Been Framed, Tonight at the London Palladium and Police, Camera, Action in the hell category. \"Like the English diet of the 17th century, all meat and bread, meat and potatoes, never a green in sight,\" sighs Wootton. </p> <p>Liddiment is also fixing ITV's daytime schedule, another area of poor performance (arguably due to the emphasis on peak) and now shorn of Home &amp; Away, poached by Channel 5. The uninviting mix of Minder repeats and Jerry Springer, dubbed as \"thin workhouse gruel\" by adland critics, will be replaced by the resuscitated Crossroads, with repeats of the new teatime soap Trafalgar Road. As for the big investment planned for BBC1, Liddiment notes calmly: \"It's a factor you have to take into account,\" while adding that ITV has been investing well ahead of inflation for some years now. Behind the scenes pressure is growing for ITV's two big owners, especially Granada, to plough back the savings from merger into a matching investment in programme content, even though that will mean smaller dividends for shareholders. </p> <p>Some of the advertisers who lobbied so hard for moving News at Ten now say sheepishly they had assumed a 9pm news on BBC1 was immovable. Compounded with all this is the unsexy but very real corrosive influence of multi-channel television and specifically Sky Digital, a platform ITV has refused to join since its launch two years ago. Under chief executive Tony Ball, Sky is at its most aggressive, last week making five-year supply pacts with NTL, its largest cable rival, while simultaneously promising to market its own enhanced video recorders. </p> <p>Zenith's influential quarterly report, Zenith On TV, is headed by a telling foreword by an advertiser - Mike Moran, commercial director of Toyota - who describes his (digital) household viewing during a 10-day summer break: \"In the multi-media paradise that is Moran Towers, neither the kids nor my wife nor I once felt the urge to switch from widescreen into 'TV from the heart', ITV never registering. </p> <p>\"With the biggest claimed budget of a single channel across Europe, what has gone wrong with their schedule, programme content, and marketing and promotion that led to a situation where family Moran had dialled out of ITV consciousness?\" </p> <p> Charles Allen's view, expressed at Edinburgh, that by 2003 ITV would be broadcasting on digital satellite, has gone down badly. In August, ITV's share in Sky Digital homes fell again, to 15.9% (compared with 17.7% in July), worse for a second month than BBC1 (17% in August), which is on digital satellite. ITV says the cost of having to rent 23 transponders to fulfil its regional commitments, rather than one like everyone else, is too high, and that the Independent Television Commission (ITC) is taking a hard line. Yet BBC1, Channel 4 and Channel 5 make do with one transponder, and BBC1 puts out News 24 in the 6.30pm regional news slot. ITN News has managed to buy into digital satellite without a problem. With digital gaining further momentum, waiting seems risky. </p> <p>Yet there are hopeful signs too. The consolidation of ITV into two big shareholders, as Liddiment says, \"has happened as painlessly as possible.\" And with the ITC prepared to talk to settle the News at Ten dispute, a period of neglect may be ending as Granada cracks the whip. Further, the Network Centre team broadly commands respect, with Elliott rated the most successful and consistent drama controller of any channel. </p> <p>The crucial commercial issue is whether advertisers can do without ITV and switch ads to other channels. The answer remains no, or at least not yet. \"The great point about ITV is that it rapidly reaches most people,\" says Nick Phillips of the IPA. Advertisers are still paying a premium for its airtime. This is expressed as the cost per thousand adults. ITV's price is \u00a37.65 per thousand, Zenith points out, compared with Channel 4's \u00a37.06 and and the average which fluctuates below \u00a37. </p> <p>So its condition is troubling, but not grave. But defending a role as the biggest, most resourced commercial network pulling the largest audiences is becoming harder and harder to pull off.</p>",

The statistics trip off the corporate tongue as only Americans know how. Yes, they're promising more than 3,000 staff broadcasting a record 441 hours to an estimated 230m American viewers.

The statistics trip off the corporate tongue as only Americans know how. Yes, they're promising more than 3,000 staff broadcasting a record 441 hours to an estimated 230m American viewers. And yet not one second of the games will be shown live on TV. Nothing to do with time zone differences, the apparent explanation is that neither their viewers nor their advertisers want to watch everything as it happens.

      "body": "<p>Ever since Smashy and Nicey spelt it out for us, doing \"a lot of work for charidy\" has been universally interpreted as a ruse by the overpaid and over-the-hill to turn around a tarnished public image. </p> <p>So when two well-heeled advertising agencies announce new charity initiatives in the same week, the cynics are bound to go into overdrive. </p> <p>TBWA, wearing its conscience on its sleeve, has created a bold new campaign for the Big Issue. And to pay for the media space, it has arranged a soiree at the Science Museum with guest speakers Mo Mowlam and Big Issue founder John Bird. </p> <p>The agency is inviting around 50 of its bigger clients to the evening and in return will ask them to donate a double-page spread from their own media schedules to the Big Issue's cause. </p> <p>Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, meanwhile, has just launched a big, glossy coffee table book called Social Work - Saatchi &amp; Saatchi's Cause-Related Ideas. They seem to have forgotten the second half of Smashy and Nicey's line: \"I do a lot of work for charidy but I don't like to talk about it\". A 300-page book outlining their good deeds smacks of bragging. </p> <p>But advertising executives are an all too easy target. Ed Jones, who compiled the Saatchi book, says: \"People think we're all sabre-toothed tigers and it's not true. But it wouldn't even matter if it was true - as long as the good causes benefit. The book shows that advertising can be a force for good in the world; it's often presented as an evil activity.\" </p> <p>The good causes represented in the book include Greenpeace, the NSPCC, the Commission for Racial Equality, the Gun Control Network and Partnership for a Drug-Free America. And, despite its self-congratulatory tone, the work on show is some of the most creative, thought-provoking and memorable advertising of the past 30 years. </p> <p>Who can forget the \"pregnant man\" poster or, more recently, the NSPCC \"full stop\" campaign? Whatever the adman's motives, people take notice and the good causes benefit. </p> <p>Barnardo's latest campaign - the one where a baby injects heroin - provoked outrage and brought almost as much media attention to Bartle Bogle Hegarty as it did to the charity. But Barnardo's head of advertising Suzanne Heaney doesn't mind one bit. \"We don't feel used,\" she says, \"because it all works in our favour.\" </p> <p>The cynical people tend to be the young creatives who want to make a name for themselves. They pick on a charity, make a shocking ad on spec and then persuade said charity to run the ad. The next step is for the team to place the ad in some obscure 4am television slot and - hey presto - they win an award. In adland, one decent award can double an already fat salary, and a creative team can make a whole career on the back of it. </p> <p>Saatchi's book contains an ad for that well-known \"good cause,\" Islington council. It shows a man emerging from his front door first thing in the morning, clad only in his pyjamas. He pulls his pants down, squats on the pavement and after much straining, deposits the fruit of his labours right on his own doorstep. A businessman walks past on his way to work and - surprise, surprise - slips on the mess. </p> <p>The line is: \"You wouldn't. Don't let your dog\", and it won awards for the team that created it. There is not so much a social conscience at work here as a childish sense of humour and a hunger for recognition. </p> <p>Charity clients, however, are getting wise to these tactics. Most now employ sophisticated career marketers who want to know that an ad will fit with their brand image before they approve it. Even if an agency is offering its services for free, the client won't just roll over and be grateful. </p> <p>Johnny Hornby of TBWA says that he will only consider the Big Issue campaign a success if the agency succeeds in getting plenty of free media space from its clients. \"I like doing ads that run rather than ads that win awards,\" he says. </p> <p>But let's face it, Johnny Hornby is never going to be homeless. As he's the thirtysomething joint managing director of one of London's top advertising agencies, the size of his pay packet could stand up to comparison with the most affluent of his generation. </p> <p>To be fair, Hornby is not pretending that TBWA has anything more to offer than advertising skills. He is no bleeding heart: \"It's good for agency morale when we all pull together to do something that makes a difference,\" he says. \"They are nice ads. We're just doing what we do anyway. And it's more interesting than toothpaste.\" </p> <p>Lucie Russell, the Big Issue Foundation's chief executive, says: \"Obviously we're good for their corporate CV and they always mention that we're a client in their quarterly reports. If they get press out of the new campaign then it's fine by us. We don't pay them and no one is completely altruistic. But TBWA seems genuinely to want to help us.\" </p> <p>On a recent away day, TBWA's 280 staff were given the opportunity to vote on how to spend the \u00a320,000 that management had put aside for a project to \"make a difference to the agency\". The winning idea was another day away from work, but this time they would spend the day refurbishing a hostel for the homeless. </p> <p>TBWA's clients include NatWest Bank, Rupert Murdoch's News International and Marlboro cigarettes. Saatchi &amp; Saatchi makes ads for Hewlett-Packard, Sony and Toyota. As long as these corporate giants continue to spend millions on advertising, their agencies will be able to find the time and resources to assuage their consciences through service to good causes. </p> <p>But there's no need to feel concern for the big clients who fund the saintly impulses of the advertising community. Russell has more of a problem with these \"corporate monsters\" than she does with advertising agencies. \"We are constantly disappointed by the big companies. They always want to know what's in it for them and where their name will appear,\" she says. </p> <p>The agencies, of course, already know what's in it for them.</p>",

I'm a subscriber, I always see what new features they're adding from there. Last online purchase? A hotel room in Amsterdam, through lastminute.com obviously. Most recent technological faux pas? On another website, when I was ordering something to be delivered to my father in New York overnight. It was a major American site and it wasn't clear which was the recipient's address and which was the billing address. I realised my mistake at the end and corrected it. We don't yet deliver overnight but the Americans do. Main news sources on web? BBC.co.uk, I'm afraid. I use loads of them. The standard.com, which is the industry standard, even Revolution (revolution.haynet.com) and New Media Age (nma.co.uk). I also use news.com and tornado- insider.com, another industry one. Most persistent spam emailer? The spam ones I filter off. Time spent on web? Practically all day. Web and email basically. Next boo.com/clickmango? I couldn't possibly name one.
