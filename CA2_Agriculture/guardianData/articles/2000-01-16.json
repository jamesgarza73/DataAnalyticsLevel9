      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The hype began in the autumn of 1997. Zadie Smith was 21 and just down from Cambridge when her first novel was sold on a mere 80 pages for an advance rumoured to be in the region of \u00a3250,000. </p> <p>Nearly two-and-a-half years on, White Teeth (Hamish Hamilton, \u00a312.99) is finished, at a weighty 462 pages, and about to be published. It is a broad, teeming, comic novel of multiracial Britain viewed through the lives of two families, and has already earned its author comparisons with Salman Rushdie and the kind of media attention not often lavished on a new writer. </p> <p>Smith takes me to a caff in Willesden, north-west London, not unlike the one in which her two main characters, Archie Jones and Samad Iqbal, spend much of their time philosophising. She confesses that she has found the whole publicity whirl quite daunting. </p> <p>'I didn't think the book would take two years to write,' she says, 'but I was quite lazy. And I had moments of fear, of not being able to write anything.' Because of the advance? She laughs diffidently; she has already refused to confirm the sum involved, but admits that it was big. 'Partly that. It did make my life a bit ridiculous really - it made me scared that I wasn't going to be able to finish the book, or that it wasn't going to be any good. But in the end, you just have to forget about it; otherwise you'd never write a word. These things happen sometimes, these freak events in publishing. Next year it will happen to someone else.' </p> <p>Smith, still only 24, is currently enjoying the kind of success that most novelists can barely dream of. As well as wide spread publicity for the book, which has already been sold in 8 countries, she was asked to write a short story for the New Yorker's millennial fiction issue, and in April is travelling to New York to take part in a literary festival organised by the magazine and to promote the American publication of White Teeth.</p> <p>Next month, she begins a stint as writer in residence at the Institute for Contemporary Arts in London. Despite all this, she is remarkably unassuming, quietly articulate though slightly shy about being interviewed, rolling cigarettes with nervous fingers and holding them, unsmoked, like a prop. She is modest, almost dismissive, about the book she has written, as if she genuinely didn't realise how good it really is, and insists that she finds it 'excruciating' to read.</p> <p>She is quick to correct a recent newspaper assertion that she left Cambridge with a double First. 'Actually, I got a Third in my Part Ones,' she says, grinning. At the moment, she is still living with her Jamaican mother in Willesden, where she grew up, and where her novel is largely set. </p> <p>'White Teeth is not really based on personal family experience,' she answers thoughtfully, when I ask if her own mixed-race background had furnished much of the story (her father is English). 'When you come from a mixed-race family, it makes you think a bit harder about inheritance and what's passed on from generation to generation. But as for racial tensions - I'm sure my parents had the usual trouble getting hotel rooms and so on, but I don't talk to them much about that part of their lives. A lot of it is guesswork or comes from reading accounts of immigrants coming here. I suppose the trick of the novel, if there is one, is to transpose the kind of friendships we have now to a generation which was less likely to be friends in that way.' </p> <p>She is referring to the book's pivotal relationship, the 50-year friendship between Archie, a working-class Londoner, and Samad, a Bengali Muslim, whose ill-fated affair with a white woman proves a catalyst for the novel's central events. I ask if she found it difficult to write in the consciousness of a middle-aged man, but Smith is unusually confident for a young writer. </p> <p>'As long as you honestly believe that people can be, say or do anything, then you stop worrying about it,' she says earnestly. 'I worried about things that were objectively anachronistic, like whether you would find a pizza place in 1975, because that jars when you read it, but to worry about whether a Bengali man of a certain age might say or think such and such, well, that's very limiting. You have to use your imagination.' </p> <p>This imaginative element, I suggest, extends to the way in which race relations are portrayed in the book. Smith offers a very optimistic vision: prejudice exists, but tolerance appears in equal measure, and racist violence is only mentioned briefly and at second hand. Is this is an optimism she genuinely feels? </p> <p>'It is kind of a fantasy book,' she agrees. 'There is a lot of pessimism currently about race relations in this country. I think the relationships in the book are something to be wished for, but I think they might exist now, and certainly in the future, with the amount of mixing up that has gone on. My generation, and my younger brother's generation even more, don't carry the same kind of baggage.'</p> <p>But racial prejudice is still a part of daily life, especially in London. She tells me how her 16-year-old brother was stopped by the police only two days before. 'He was just walking down the street and they thought he'd robbed a house or something, so they threw him up against the car, asked him if he had any weed on him. I think it is a completely different experience for black men in this country.' </p> <p>Her own experience, she says, was always softened by her academic achievements, though she hints that this might have been through a desire to overcompensate in the face of prejudice. 'When I was little, we'd go on holiday to Devon, and there, if you're black and you go into a sweetshop, for instance, everyone turns and looks at you. So my instinct as a child was always to over-compensate by trying to behave three times as well as every other child in the shop, so they knew I wasn't going to take anything or hurt anyone. I think that instinct has spilled over into my writing in some ways, which is not something I like very much or want to continue.' </p> <p>Several times, she mentions a desire to change the way she writes; admiring John Lanchester's Mr Phillips, which she has just finished reading, she says: 'The best thing about it is that it's very sparse. I'd like a bit of that in my own writing.' </p> <p>Smith is already well into a second novel, The Autograph Man, about which she will say little except that it is about Jewish cabbalism and is 'much funnier' than White Teeth, which she doesn't consider particularly funny (though it is). She wants to continue to write fiction, though she swears she will never write such a long book again. 'It was more than 700 pages at one point, and I think when a book gets that long, it's because you're not in control of it. Although publishers seem to like long books,' she adds. I suggest this might be because it allows them to feel they're getting their money's worth; she laughs. </p> <p>She says, half jokingly, that she would like to write a 'cool' novel one day - 'I feel like a bit of a young fogey at the moment.' But she need not worry too much on that count. In her turban, thick-rimmed glasses and big trainers, she looks like a fairer-skinned version of Lauryn Hill. She is a fan of hip-hop, and the book is peppered with street language and hip-hop argot. The most animated I have seen her is when she spots an article about Madonna in the paper and pounces on it - 'I'm a huge fan'. </p> <p>On the table behind us, two old men who've come in for their tea and could have been cameo characters from White Teeth, are watching with delight as John, our photographer, sets up a phalanx of equipment and Zadie poses self-consciously at a window table. </p> <p>'I think she's a film star,' says one confidentially to his mate. 'I've seen her in that thing off the telly.' </p> <p>'Excuse me,' says the other, 'but is she off the telly?' </p> <p>'Not yet,' I say, 'but she will be.'</p>",

Smith is already well into a second novel, The Autograph Man, about which she will say little except that it is about Jewish cabbalism and is 'much funnier' than White Teeth, which she doesn't consider particularly funny (though it is). She wants to continue to write fiction, though she swears she will never write such a long book again. 'It was more than 700 pages at one point, and I think when a book gets that long, it's because you're not in control of it. Although publishers seem to like long books,' she adds. I suggest this might be because it allows them to feel they're getting their money's worth; she laughs. She says, half jokingly, that she would like to write a 'cool' novel one day - 'I feel like a bit of a young fogey at the moment.' But she need not worry too much on that count. In her turban, thick-rimmed glasses and big trainers, she looks like a fairer-skinned version of Lauryn Hill. She is a fan of hip-hop, and the book is peppered with street language and hip-hop argot. The most animated I have seen her is when she spots an article about Madonna in the paper and pounces on it - 'I'm a huge fan'. On the table behind us, two old men who've come in for their tea and could have been cameo characters from White Teeth, are watching with delight as John, our photographer, sets up a phalanx of equipment and Zadie poses self-consciously at a window table. 'I think she's a film star,' says one confidentially to his mate. 'I've seen her in that thing off the telly.' 'Excuse me,' says the other, 'but is she off the telly?' 'Not yet,' I say, 'but she will be.'",

It might seem like minor criticism, but in describing a city obsessed by its own geography - for lack of any history or community - Shaw's book would have benefited from a drier analysis. It slightly spoils an otherwise beguiling account of a music industry governed by the race for cash. Mainstream pop music may have sacrificed its ideals for political influence; hip hop, according to Shaw, remains violently wedded to all notions of Americana.",

The sense of loss resonates throughout the narrative, as Elizabeth returns to her memories of childhood in a large Scottish mansion. She describes, with breathtaking clarity and simplicity, a world of nursery teas, roaring fires, fierce nannies, hunts and a mother who sweeps in and out of the children's orbit, usually with grand visitors in tow. </p> <p>It's something of a shock, then, to hear references to hippies, Tony Blackburn and 'Bridge Over Troubled Water'. This is the timeless childhood of the aristocracy, an aristocracy, it later emerges, battling with drink, death duties and imminent ruin. </p> <p>It is a world in which privilege and neglect go hand in hand. Baby Annie, the latest addition to the household, is swiftly relegated from her 'cot tied with ribbons' next to Mama's bed to a 'cot with wooden bars' in the night nursery. 'Sometimes she cries such a long, sad cry,' says Elizabeth matter of factly, 'that James and I take it in turns to climb in beside her to stroke her soft, black, furry hair and hot cheek.' Mama is keen to keep things 'nice' at all costs, but barely glances at the book of pictures Elizabeth has so painstakingly stitched her for Christmas. </p> <p>In prose so starkly beautiful that you want to quote great swathes of it, McEwan captures the innocence and excitement of childhood, the vivid intensity of the child's-eye view and the child's visceral delight in exploring and experiencing the world. </p> <p>'I can smell the gooseberry leaves in the wet air,' she observes coolly, but just as real for her are 'the invisible beings of the house' which 'seem to draw closer to me'. Elizabeth adores her father, living for his smiles, winks and 'warm breath in the dark', but one day finds his warm gaze replaced by 'a black chasm'. Too young to understand the effects of drink and despair, she later concludes that he 'has been swallowed by the monster that lives in the great, gaping space down the middle of the staircase'.</p> <p>Everything is given equal weight in her cool, clear, resonant voice: stealing the communion wafers and wine, her first, explosive encounter with Mozart, peeing in James's cowboy hat because she can't find the toilet in the dark. Touching, poetic and utterly unsentimental, The Big House is a mesmerising debut. </p> <p>Most children dream of flying, but learn, after several tumbles on the stairs, to adapt to the constraints of life without wings. The unnamed protagonist of Bill Broady's extraordinary first novel,<strong> Swimmer</strong> (Flamingo \u00a39.99, pp139), retains the dream of flight, symbolised by her profound love of butterflies. 'What you had taken for the sound of its wings was the beating of your own heart,' the narrator observes of her first encounter with a red admiral. 'You could feel its flutterings on your nerve ends.' As this quotation indicates, the novel is recounted not in the first, but in the second person, adding an additional distancing quality to a narrative already marked for its strangeness and beauty. </p> <p>'You don't need to fly... that's what your imagination's for!' says the girl's father on finding his five-year-old daughter sprawled among the zinnias after leaping from the bathroom window, but she has acquired the taste for it, splashing and flying in the water at Worthing. There, she discovered that 'this new, white world was welcoming you, that these whispers and roars were a language you understood, that the tides beat with the same pulse as your circulating blood'. Water becomes her natural element, though every time she dives, she holds on to 'the vestigial hope' that she might slip 'through the roof's retracted skylight and up into the blue'. </p> <p>When 'the Coach' arrives on the scene, he assesses her childish physique and announces: 'A butterfly, I think... ', allowing her to become, in a sense, the thing she loves most of all. The price she pays for her constant communion with the water, her ability to soar and fly beyond the dreams of ordinary mortals, is the competition circuit. Childhood and puberty are spent powering up and down pools, fighting pain, exhaustion and the water's changing moods. </p> <p>Parents, fellow pupils and competitors remain shadowy, insubstantial figures in this tale of watery solipsism and obsession. At 19, it's all over. The Coach is swapped for a manager, who offers a new career, 'promo-ing' and a new circuit: the talk shows, catalogues and calendars of minor celebrity. When 'tits and ass' work is all that's on offer, she descends into pure madness, hurling her medals at tramps and running wildly through the city. </p> <p>Echoing the aspirations of its heroine, Broady's stunning narrative seems to hover in its own distinctive element and, at times, to soar and fly. In prose of poetic precision and poignancy, he touches on the deepest dreams of the human heart: how those who dream of flying end up doing panto in Romford, how a child can swim and swim 'for Dad to let you sit on his knee again, for Mum to pour her gin away'. </p> <p>There's a return to more traditional narrative in American William Kowalski's epic, <strong> Eddie's Bastard</strong> (Doubleday, \u00a39.99, pp367). Like The Big House, it's about family, memory and piecing together the fragments of the past, but Kowalski's workaday prose couldn't be more different to McEwan's poetic compression. Its opening sentence - 'I arrived in the way most bastards do - by surprise' - is a nod at Tristram Shandy and with chapters helpfully outlining their contents - 'I Am Born'; 'I Learn To Read'; 'The Ghosts'; 'I Encounter Annie Simpson' - it self-consciously declares itself in the great storytelling tradition. </p> <p>The story it tells is that of Billy Mann, abandoned on the doorstep of Thomas Mann with a label saying 'Eddie's bastard'. Recognising him as the progeny of his heroic son, Eddie, killed at Vietnam, Thomas sets about bringing up this latest addition to the glittering Mann clan. Unfortunately, he spends much of his time in a whiskey-induced stupor but does manage to squeeze out a few of the Mann stories, fuelling a growing obsession with family histories and a vocation as a writer. </p> <p> Eddie's Bastard is a good read, at times quite touching, but it is marred by Kowalski's excessive fondness for schmaltz, whimsicality and homespun wisdom. Unless I missed the irony, it seems to promote a kind of New Age belief in past lives and the importance of not ignoring coincidences. 'We of small-town America still believe in placating ghosts, I guess,' announces Billy irritatingly. Kowalski has, apparently, been compared to John Irving. Perhaps they meant John-Boy. The Waltons meets The Celestine Prophecy. </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502378006,00.html\">Buy The Big House at BOL</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502333352,00.html\">Buy Swimmer at BOL</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502345738,00.html\">Buy Eddie's Bastard at BOL</a></p>",

In a way, it's surprising that work hasn't always been a central fact for the novel; after all, it's the place where most of us spend a substantial chunk of our time, where many of us meet our partners. It's an arena where power is exercised and controlled, where social encounters are forced on us, where the novelist, one might have thought, could always have found a rich source of material. </p> <p>But it's only recently that this has started to be the case. Apart from a few acknowledged classics, such as Roy Fuller's Portrait of a Society, that marvellous novel of building-society politics, novelists tended to stick to a few familiar areas, preferring to regard the means by which characters earn their money as marginal to their consciousnesses. Who can remember what any of Iris Murdoch's characters do for a living? They are either schoolteachers or civil servants and that is an end to it. </p> <p>A really first-rate novel of professional life, such as James Buchan's sublime High Latitudes, is as rare as it ever was, and the fabulous novelistic riches of life in the City, of law and commerce, are left by literature in the clammy hands of the Archers and the Grishams. </p> <p>John Lanchester's second novel, Mr Phillips, is a brave stab at a difficult subject. It evokes the world of work through a negative perspective and feels, in the end, something like a novel about bereavement. Its hero, Mr Phillips, has lost his job as an accountant at a small, rather grubby firm where he has worked for decades. That was on Friday. The novel is set on Monday, by which time he has still not told his wife. What is he to do? Well, he gets up, puts on a suit and goes to work, or pretends to. What he really does is wander around London, with a day to kill. </p> <p>He wanders in and out of adventures, glimpsing the extravagant life of the city from the unfamiliar perspective of the daytime idler. A tramp and a schoolgirl, perfect strangers, snog ecstatically on a bus; a walk round the Tate Gallery ends in an embarrassing encounter with a buttonholing enthusiast; an ecumenical meeting in a church breaks down in argument. Memory and regret play a vivid part in the day, as Mr Phillips contemplates his lost job, his past, his family and his unfulfilled desires. </p> <p>The book is always engaging and interesting. It builds to a climax rich in sentiment, as Mr Phillips narrowly escapes death in a bank robbery and has a fortuitously, ambiguously heartwarming encounter with the widow of his old RE teacher. It's difficult, however, to avoid the nagging feeling that it's rather fatally lacking in ambition. Despite being in the third person, it's as much a monologue as Lanchester's first book, The Debt To Pleasure; there is no sense of cross-cutting, of the possibility of enriching the themes by turning to subsidiary characters or subplots. As a result, there is a constant danger that the blatant automatic virtuosity will submerge the human feeling, and the whole thing become something of a music-hall turn. </p> <p>Lanchester isn't helped by his penchant for numerical fantasy. Mr Phillips is constantly having recourse to pointless, extravagant codification of emotional facts. How often do people have sex? A few pages of calculation balance out 'Highlanders in their distant crofts' with the thoroughly oversexed, who turn out, surprisingly, to be film critics, and produces the answer that there is 'an average daily probability of 96.7 per cent against having sex'. </p> <p>These rather Nicholson Bakerish explorations are always interesting and usually funny, but are not, quite, in the right book and the reader turns back from them to Mr Phillips's long and troubled day rather unwillingly. Occasionally, there is a convincing sense that Mr Phillips is filling his head with accountants' trivia to escape bigger questions - he lies on the floor of the bank with a shotgun to his head and tells himself all the childish jokes he can remember - but one mostly feels the statistical fantasies are there because Lanchester wants to put them in. </p> <p>Though there is a recurrent sense that too many formal decisions have been made before starting to write - the decision to confine the book to a single day, the artificial and unconvincing decision to refer to the main character only as Mr Phillips - these are only frustrating for the reader because the direct and indirect exploration of the inner life is often truthful and natural. It is artificial and wrong to hobble the episode of a hero's grief at his father's death by feeling obliged to go on calling him 'Mr Phillips', and it is annoying because everything else in the episode moves so naturally and feelingly. </p> <p>Lanchester is a novelist easy to express an admiration for, and that is largely because of the external inventions, the constant sense of the virtuoso. Those conceits, however, are not the richest things in his writing and he would be wise to start thinking about dropping the funny voice and start talking with the periodic, rich truth which makes Mr Phillips worth recommending. His books, at the moment, are too driven by a sort of aesthetic embarrassment. When he gets over that, he is going to do something truly individual.</p>",

What he really does is wander around London, with a day to kill. He wanders in and out of adventures, glimpsing the extravagant life of the city from the unfamiliar perspective of the daytime idler. A tramp and a schoolgirl, perfect strangers, snog ecstatically on a bus; a walk round the Tate Gallery ends in an embarrassing encounter with a buttonholing enthusiast; an ecumenical meeting in a church breaks down in argument. Memory and regret play a vivid part in the day, as Mr Phillips contemplates his lost job, his past, his family and his unfulfilled desires. The book is always engaging and interesting. It builds to a climax rich in sentiment, as Mr Phillips narrowly escapes death in a bank robbery and has a fortuitously, ambiguously heartwarming encounter with the widow of his old RE teacher. It's difficult, however, to avoid the nagging feeling that it's rather fatally lacking in ambition. Despite being in the third person, it's as much a monologue as Lanchester's first book, The Debt To Pleasure; there is no sense of cross-cutting, of the possibility of enriching the themes by turning to subsidiary characters or subplots. As a result, there is a constant danger that the blatant automatic virtuosity will submerge the human feeling, and the whole thing become something of a music-hall turn. Lanchester isn't helped by his penchant for numerical fantasy. Mr Phillips is constantly having recourse to pointless, extravagant codification of emotional facts. How often do people have sex? A few pages of calculation balance out 'Highlanders in their distant crofts' with the thoroughly oversexed, who turn out, surprisingly, to be film critics, and produces the answer that there is 'an average daily probability of 96.7 per cent against having sex'. These rather Nicholson Bakerish explorations are always interesting and usually funny, but are not, quite, in the right book and the reader turns back from them to Mr Phillips's long and troubled day rather unwillingly. Occasionally, there is a convincing sense that Mr Phillips is filling his head with accountants' trivia to escape bigger questions - he lies on the floor of the bank with a shotgun to his head and tells himself all the childish jokes he can remember - but one mostly feels the statistical fantasies are there because Lanchester wants to put them in. Though there is a recurrent sense that too many formal decisions have been made before starting to write - the decision to confine the book to a single day, the artificial and unconvincing decision to refer to the main character only as Mr Phillips - these are only frustrating for the reader because the direct and indirect exploration of the inner life is often truthful and natural. It is artificial and wrong to hobble the episode of a hero's grief at his father's death by feeling obliged to go on calling him 'Mr Phillips', and it is annoying because everything else in the episode moves so naturally and feelingly. Lanchester is a novelist easy to express an admiration for, and that is largely because of the external inventions, the constant sense of the virtuoso. Those conceits, however, are not the richest things in his writing and he would be wise to start thinking about dropping the funny voice and start talking with the periodic, rich truth which makes Mr Phillips worth recommending. His books, at the moment, are too driven by a sort of aesthetic embarrassment. When he gets over that, he is going to do something truly individual.",

Reports to the NHS executive suggested elective surgery was grinding to a halt and the number of spare beds was close to zero. The NHS winter crisis, now a near annual event, had arrived. </p> <p>Health Secretary Alan Milburn, one of the most media-savvy Cabinet Ministers, knew that the NHS was about to go on to the political front line. With bed occupancy so high and the number of intensive care beds and trained nurses so low, the Department of Health was on red alert for horror stories. </p> <p>Ministers knew that big issues were certain to be reopened, including NHS funding. Milburn also knows how critical the NHS is to Labour's political identity. The NHS - in almost all polls - ranks as the most important issue facing voters. Yet by the middle of the week Milburn looked like he had survived the crisis. Reports were starting to arrive suggesting the flu crisis was ebbing. Milburn also knew on Friday he had figures showing that waiting lists had fallen by 8,000 during November. The corner looked to have been turned. </p> <p>However, it was not an NHS horror story, let alone a skilfully aimed Opposition blow that resurrected the crisis. Instead it was an attack from one of Britain's most famous doctors, the Labour peer, Lord Winston. His remarks in the New Statesman were unambiguous and explosive, and he must have known their impact. The Government was engaged in a deceit about abolition of the internal market, he said, and warned that the NHS would deteriorate unless we pay more tax or have an insurance system. </p> <p>On Friday, Alastair Campbell applied the screws using Winston's unethical revelations about Cherie Blair's pregnancy as a lever with which to force him to retract. Even his supposed recantation amounted to nothing since he again said: 'Successive governments - and this one included - have not yet paid sufficient attention to the needs for funding that are going to be required for the future.' </p> <p>But Lord Winston drew sympathy from doctors, glad that someone so high-profile - and so close to Labour - had spoken out. Most of the medical bodies put out unprecedented statements of support - except for the comments on private medical insurance. </p> <p>Milburn's insistence that the number of doctors was being increased met a quick rebuff from Barry Jackson, the president of the Royal College of Surgeons. He said that in surgery, and some other branches of medicine, the number of doctors is actually being reduced. The number of general surgery training posts is being cut by 25 this year, and in orthopaedics by 20. Overall the number of national training posts is being cut by 300 from April 2000. </p> <p>'We desperately need more doctors, but at the present time the number of surgeons in training is being reduced,' said Jackson. He warned it could have a 'deleterious effect upon patient services'. </p> <p>Professor Sir George Alberti, president of the Royal College of Physicians, said the number of consultant posts needed to be doubled for them to offer adequate services. Consultants, working an average 62-hour week, were very demoralised. 'There are now more early retirements, partly because of the workload, partly because they are seen constantly as failing,' said Alberti. </p> <p>The British Medical Association chairman Ian Bogle said: 'It's got progressively more difficult, winter by winter, to provide the healthcare that people need.' </p> <p>Labour is also being stung by a backlash from raising voters' - and the medical profession's - expectations, and failing to deliver. 'You have the Prime Minister talking up people's expectations - you can have what you want where and when you want it - but people's expectations are being stretched when core service is stretching to cope,' said Stephen Thornton, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents the hospital trusts. </p> <p>Part of the problem, according to Alberti, is simply that medical techniques are advancing fast, but the resources aren't available to provide them. 'A few years ago, if you had a stroke, you would have stayed at home, where as now we know you do much better in a stroke unit,' Alberti said. 'The Government has shot itself in its collective feet by not increasing resources sufficiently.' </p> <p>But while doctors condemn Labour for not providing resources, they approve of many individual policies. </p> <p>The internal market has been modified. National Service Frameworks and the National Institute of Clinical Excellence should go someway to ending the post-code lottery of healthcare. The biggest new hospital programme in the history of the NHS is under way; casualty departments are being modernised; nurses are being recruited back into the NHS and new services are being developed, such as the telephone service NHS direct. </p> <p>But Labour's main commitment to reduce waiting lists has been widely panned for distorting clinical priorities, and even some of its innovations aren't clear winners. According to Julia Neuberger, head of the King's Fund, a leading think-tank on healthcare: 'Labour's record is very patchy. They have big ideas like the NHS Direct, which they haven't piloted or evaluated, so it's very difficult to tell where the improve ments lie.' The one point that doctors and Ministers agree on is that demand on the NHS is growing. In 1998-99 there were 450,000 extra operations for people on the waiting lists, 142,000 extra emergency cases and half a million extra outpatient appointments. </p> <p>The pressure is now on Milburn to deliver. But on two issues he has been clear. He sees no role for an extension of private health insurance, and the NHS is still underfunded. He has also used the crisis skilfully to start making unusually public bids for massive extra cash. Negotiations are now under way on a further three-year spending programme, the first year of which will supersede the last year (2001-02) of the existing one. The first review covered this year, next year and the year thereafter, 2001-02, offering a cumulative \u00a321bn. It gave the NHS real terms growth of 5.7 per cent, 4.5 per cent and 3.9 per cent in each successive year. </p> <p>Gordon Brown, the Chancellor, has said the presumption will be that the figures announced for each department for 2001-02 will remain, but Milburn is reopening negotiations for 2001-02. He is seeking increases totalling more than 5 per cent in real term rises for three years. Milburn has not ruled out earmarked taxes for health - an 'NHS tax'. Referring to the difficulties in raising tax generally, he added: 'Many people would see it as a way out of the dilemma.' </p> <p>Doctors, insistent that the drip feed of finance just perpetuates the crises, are determined that something radical must be done. The BMA - until recently completely wedded to the idea of a tax-only funded NHS - is considering ways, any ways, of getting more money into healthcare in Britain. BMA chairman Ian Bogle, refuses to rule out calling for more private health insurance, said: 'A few years ago, there's no way you would have got the chairman of the BMA going to his council saying we need to look at other ways of funding - and then getting a unanimous vote of support.

The celebrated early riser duly bounced in, saying that he needed only some five hours sleep a night. 'Like Margaret Thatcher,' I ventured. 'Don't compare me with that woman,' he snarled. </p> <p>Much as he might hate it, there is another similarity, though. No matter the - how shall we describe it? - advice offered by press or public about the image and performance of his football club, he is certain he knows best. And just as Thatcher was the last of the 'My Way' politicians disdainful of any need for spin doctors to sweeten the pill, so Ferguson may be the end of the line for off-message Manchester United managers. </p> <p>After a fortnight which has proved that there's an awful lot of copy in Brazil, Ferguson will undoubtedly return to England refreshed and ready for a new round of jousting with Premiership, press and fellow managers. Expect a week of psychological point-scoring with Ars\u00e9ne Wenger in the run-up to next Monday's mouth-watering contest between United and Arsenal. </p> <p>Like his team, Ferguson has hardly covered himself in glory in Rio, however. There was the public spat with a journalist and his defence of the indefensible in the shape of David Beckham's sending off. To the outside world, it has been a public relations nightmare. Ferguson might even been grateful for the night moves of the club's chief executive Martin Edwards last week. </p> <p>Ferguson has never been averse to berating a journo in public 'pour encourager les autres'. Most stay onside out of fear that his angry tongue will turn on them and such overt displays help in that process. In addition, his policy of always supporting his players in public - with the impression cleverly given that it is much different in private - makes him a player's manager of the sort they want to sign and play for.</p> <p>He has been criticised for such tactics of late, though Edwards's nocturnal affairs which were exposed in The Mirror when it was probably not the inflation rate in Brazil he was discussing with an enterprising young local lady, have occupied more of the attention of an alarmed plc board back in Britain. </p> <p>Suffice to say that Edwards is unlikely to become United's third knight after Ferguson and Sir Bobby Charlton, whose function at the club as the cheery and acceptable face of Manchester United has been more valuable than ever of late. After all, there is only room for two knights on a chess team, which the club comes more to resemble as strategy on and off the field evolves with their growing world profile. </p> <p>The word last week was that Edwards's sleazy indiscretions are also likely to cost him the new chairmanship of United plc and he may be forced to walk away - finally, having twice tried to sell out - with the consolation of his millions. </p> <p>Ferguson, having won a battle over the finances of the club, both for his own salary and that of Roy Keane, wins again over a man with whom there has been little love lost. What may then change in the political climate at Old Trafford is that the flame of attention returns to Ferguson and he will have no-one else to deflect any heat. </p> <p>What has been interesting in Rio is how bad results have made Ferguson fair game for criticism of his methods. Much more of the same back home, and he can expect some old scores to be settled in the media. </p> <p>Not that he is likely to care. In that interview with me, he spoke of the need for a club to have a cause that drives them, whether it be to prove the press wrong or to respond with a victory to a chanting, antagonistic crowd fuelled by jealousy. He is likely to use the so-called 'Fiasco in Rio' as a rocket-up-the-backside launchpad for the rest of the season. </p> <p>His results have made him perhaps the greatest manager of all in the English game, certainly assured him his place in the pantheon. As such, his methods are virtually beyond the reproach of any plc board. It is, after all, results rather than image that provide the best marketing tool for the merchandisers and keep the share price high.</p> <p>What looks likely, though, is that when the time finally comes to appoint a successor to Sir Alex, the new man is likely to be more media-friendly - if not as adept as using it to his advantage - more likely to make things look and sound good; maybe a groomed New Coach rather than a growling Old Manager. Bearing in mind the growing global implications, the board's appointment will surely be more 'Our Way'. </p> <p>Whoever it is, there is unlikely to be as much substance beneath, however. There are many who see Ferguson as a whinger, who grow annoyed by his justification of self and erring players, but this is a man who knows inside-out the game, its players and how to mould, meld and motivate them. As with any great sporting figure, we will miss him once he is gone.</p>",

And just as Thatcher was the last of the 'My Way' politicians disdainful of any need for spin doctors to sweeten the pill, so Ferguson may be the end of the line for off-message Manchester United managers. After a fortnight which has proved that there's an awful lot of copy in Brazil, Ferguson will undoubtedly return to England refreshed and ready for a new round of jousting with Premiership, press and fellow managers. Expect a week of psychological point-scoring with Ars\u00e9ne Wenger in the run-up to next Monday's mouth-watering contest between United and Arsenal. Like his team, Ferguson has hardly covered himself in glory in Rio, however. There was the public spat with a journalist and his defence of the indefensible in the shape of David Beckham's sending off. To the outside world, it has been a public relations nightmare. Ferguson might even been grateful for the night moves of the club's chief executive Martin Edwards last week. Ferguson has never been averse to berating a journo in public 'pour encourager les autres'. Most stay onside out of fear that his angry tongue will turn on them and such overt displays help in that process. In addition, his policy of always supporting his players in public - with the impression cleverly given that it is much different in private - makes him a player's manager of the sort they want to sign and play for. He has been criticised for such tactics of late, though Edwards's nocturnal affairs which were exposed in The Mirror when it was probably not the inflation rate in Brazil he was discussing with an enterprising young local lady, have occupied more of the attention of an alarmed plc board back in Britain. Suffice to say that Edwards is unlikely to become United's third knight after Ferguson and Sir Bobby Charlton, whose function at the club as the cheery and acceptable face of Manchester United has been more valuable than ever of late. After all, there is only room for two knights on a chess team, which the club comes more to resemble as strategy on and off the field evolves with their growing world profile. The word last week was that Edwards's sleazy indiscretions are also likely to cost him the new chairmanship of United plc and he may be forced to walk away - finally, having twice tried to sell out - with the consolation of his millions. Ferguson, having won a battle over the finances of the club, both for his own salary and that of Roy Keane, wins again over a man with whom there has been little love lost. What may then change in the political climate at Old Trafford is that the flame of attention returns to Ferguson and he will have no-one else to deflect any heat. What has been interesting in Rio is how bad results have made Ferguson fair game for criticism of his methods. Much more of the same back home, and he can expect some old scores to be settled in the media. Not that he is likely to care. In that interview with me, he spoke of the need for a club to have a cause that drives them, whether it be to prove the press wrong or to respond with a victory to a chanting, antagonistic crowd fuelled by jealousy. He is likely to use the so-called 'Fiasco in Rio' as a rocket-up-the-backside launchpad for the rest of the season. His results have made him perhaps the greatest manager of all in the English game, certainly assured him his place in the pantheon. As such, his methods are virtually beyond the reproach of any plc board. It is, after all, results rather than image that provide the best marketing tool for the merchandisers and keep the share price high. What looks likely, though, is that when the time finally comes to appoint a successor to Sir Alex, the new man is likely to be more media-friendly - if not as adept as using it to his advantage - more likely to make things look and sound good; maybe a groomed New Coach rather than a growling Old Manager. Bearing in mind the growing global implications, the board's appointment will surely be more 'Our Way'. Whoever it is, there is unlikely to be as much substance beneath, however. There are many who see Ferguson as a whinger, who grow annoyed by his justification of self and erring players, but this is a man who knows inside-out the game, its players and how to mould, meld and motivate them. As with any great sporting figure, we will miss him once he is gone.",

'As a player he was consistent, would never give anything less than his best, the type of guy you could depend on. I think he has brought those qualities to his spells in management over the years. You won't meet anyone who knows more about his players or what's good for Blackburn Rovers, and that's why the club has been able to turn to him so often.' </p> <p>In one sense Blackburn have hardly been fair to Parkes over the years. Every time they have turned to him they have been in trouble, then after watching him effect an immediate improvement they have repeatedly turned to someone more famous as the next manager. Yet since that was always by Parkes' own wish, Blackburn have done the right thing by managing to hold on to a valued employee whose heart is obviously in the club. </p> <p>'It's so easy to lose people like that,' Kendall said. 'I've seen it happen time after time. You get a loyal clubman doing a good job who is persuaded to take over as manager because he passionately wants to help, then the club feels obliged to sack him when things don't work out and the new manager wants a fresh start. I think it says a lot about Blackburn and Tony Parkes that the two are still together. </p> <p>'But Blackburn is still unique in spite of everything that's happened over the last 10 years. When I was there the streets out side were still cobbled and the club's financial plight would always be the main topic of discussion at board meetings. I don't suppose it's like that now, but the great thing is that the people haven't changed. Blackburn is still run by mostly the same people, and they all love the club.' </p> <p>Parkes certainly falls into that category, having been so impressed by Jack Walker's lavish refurbishment of the club he happily suppressed his own managerial ambitions. 'If Jack Walker hadn't come along and transformed the club there might have been a time, if we had stayed a mid-table first division side, when I might have been offered the job and would probably have jumped at it,' he said. 'But I've never been under any illusions. I never wanted the club to be small and unambitious just so I could be the manager. What we have at Blackburn now is incomparably better than what we had in the old days.' </p> <p>Walker's millions proved a mixed blessing for recent Blackburn managers - Kenny Dalglish invested them astutely, others seemed to suffer from lottery-winners syndrome in allowing instant wealth to cloud their judgement - and though Parkes has made the occasional purchase he is still to be judged in the transfer market. His knack of always appearing to know which players to pick and which to leave out is not just down to hard work and close attention on the training pitch; it also helps that he has not brought any of the players to the club. The situation becomes more complicated if you are a manager whose has spent a few million on a striker who can't score or a defender prone to lapses of concentration. Parkes has all that to come. </p> <p>Walker has said that once he gets Blackburn back into the Premiership he envisages winding down his financial support, so it sounds like a case of now or never for Parkes. </p> <p>'I'm sure he'll cope,' Kendall said.

In essence, similar to actors' 'repeat' fees. </p> <p>Top players such as Owen and Giggs could earn a fortune if goals - like Owen's much-screened England effort against Argentina and Giggs's FA Cup semi-final winner for Manchester United against Arsenal - racked up royalties. </p> <p>The likelihood of claiming cash for the screening of special goals was just one possibility advanced at a recent conference on the commercialisation of football held in London. Also on the agenda were new efforts by players to earn a cut from the sale of replica team shirts and other club merchandise.</p> <p>Wimbledon skipper Robbie Earle, among those addressing the one-day seminar, said the distribution of TV cash was now a hot topic among players. 'Players like Michael Owen, David Beckham and Alan Shearer are on a par with the likes of Tiger Woods or Michael Jordan as the biggest names in sport in their own countries.

      "bodyText": "English football's top stars such as Michael Owen and Ryan Giggs are ready to cash in by copyrighting their favourite goals and charging fees every time 'their' strike is shown on screen. According to lawyers, agents and players themselves, the Premiership's big names could soon mount legal challenges to try to win a larger share of income from the sale of television rights by registering spectacular strikes as their own 'intellectual property'. It would mean their being paid for each occasion a particular goal is used by their own club or broadcasters for promotional purposes. In essence, similar to actors' 'repeat' fees. Top players such as Owen and Giggs could earn a fortune if goals - like Owen's much-screened England effort against Argentina and Giggs's FA Cup semi-final winner for Manchester United against Arsenal - racked up royalties. The likelihood of claiming cash for the screening of special goals was just one possibility advanced at a recent conference on the commercialisation of football held in London. Also on the agenda were new efforts by players to earn a cut from the sale of replica team shirts and other club merchandise. Wimbledon skipper Robbie Earle, among those addressing the one-day seminar, said the distribution of TV cash was now a hot topic among players. 'Players like Michael Owen, David Beckham and Alan Shearer are on a par with the likes of Tiger Woods or Michael Jordan as the biggest names in sport in their own countries. As the Americans have been able to control particular images of themselves and use them in marketing, so I believe it will not be too long before our footballers do likewise, including copyrighting goals.

      "body": "<p>When it comes to stars putting their countries on the world football map through their success in other environments, Liberia's renowned George Weah is one of the first names to spring to mind. But even Weah, now on loan at Chelsea from Milan - where his achievements include that of once being voted the world player of the year - might consider that he's in very good company. </p> <p>I am hard pressed to think of any foreign stars in the Premiership who are doing more to stimulate interest in English football than Morocco's Mustapha Hadji and Youseff Chippo at Coventry, South Africa's Lucas Radebe at Leeds and Nigeria's Nwankwo Kanu at Arsenal. However, there is a price to be paid for the fascinating ultra-cosmopolitan element that such men have brought to our game - as will be emphasised in the next few weeks, when a number of the players from countries outside Europe and South America will be missing from their club teams in order to play for their nations in the African Nations Cup in Ghana and Nigeria, and the Gold Cup in Miami, Los Angeles and San Diego. </p> <p>It says much about their impact in England that their enforced absence has generally not gone down very well among their club managers. Having lost two players of the calibre of Hadji and Chippo, I feel I have been harder hit than anyone. </p> <p>My own view on the matter, though, is quite philosophical. While I hate to think how many Coventry matches these two might miss - the African Nations Cup is from 22 January to 13 February -I think the point has to be made that, as I was aware that this was liable to happen when I signed the pair, I can hardly moan about it now. </p> <p>And let us get it straight - these are not 'tin pot' tournaments. To those nations concerned they are highly important and deserve to be respected. But if there is one justified bone of contention from managers and the clubs it concerns the rule that we must release players two weeks before the start of the competitions. </p> <p>Obviously, I can appreciate the importance of national teams having their players together for as long as possible but the African Nations Cup and Gold Cup take place at a time in the season when the players are already at peak fitness - there has to be room for compromise. </p> <p>For example, it was difficult to understand the stance of the Nigerian Federation over Kanu, who only became available to play for Arsenal against Leicester last Sunday on the intervention of the country's High Commisoner in London.

      "bodyText": "When it comes to stars putting their countries on the world football map through their success in other environments, Liberia's renowned George Weah is one of the first names to spring to mind. But even Weah, now on loan at Chelsea from Milan - where his achievements include that of once being voted the world player of the year - might consider that he's in very good company. I am hard pressed to think of any foreign stars in the Premiership who are doing more to stimulate interest in English football than Morocco's Mustapha Hadji and Youseff Chippo at Coventry, South Africa's Lucas Radebe at Leeds and Nigeria's Nwankwo Kanu at Arsenal. However, there is a price to be paid for the fascinating ultra-cosmopolitan element that such men have brought to our game - as will be emphasised in the next few weeks, when a number of the players from countries outside Europe and South America will be missing from their club teams in order to play for their nations in the African Nations Cup in Ghana and Nigeria, and the Gold Cup in Miami, Los Angeles and San Diego. It says much about their impact in England that their enforced absence has generally not gone down very well among their club managers. Having lost two players of the calibre of Hadji and Chippo, I feel I have been harder hit than anyone. My own view on the matter, though, is quite philosophical. While I hate to think how many Coventry matches these two might miss - the African Nations Cup is from 22 January to 13 February -I think the point has to be made that, as I was aware that this was liable to happen when I signed the pair, I can hardly moan about it now. And let us get it straight - these are not 'tin pot' tournaments. To those nations concerned they are highly important and deserve to be respected. But if there is one justified bone of contention from managers and the clubs it concerns the rule that we must release players two weeks before the start of the competitions. Obviously, I can appreciate the importance of national teams having their players together for as long as possible but the African Nations Cup and Gold Cup take place at a time in the season when the players are already at peak fitness - there has to be room for compromise. For example, it was difficult to understand the stance of the Nigerian Federation over Kanu, who only became available to play for Arsenal against Leicester last Sunday on the intervention of the country's High Commisoner in London. It seemed that we at Coventry had experienced better luck in getting Hadji and Chippo back for yesterday's match against Wimbledon. I initially asked Hadji if it would be possible for Chippo and him to return to England from Rabat for this game; he made the request personally to the Moroccan Federation; and they, conscious of the pair's popularity in England, seemed happy to agree to it. However, on Thursday night, the Moroccan coach said 'no' on the grounds that they might get injured. All of which has inevitably made me more conscious than ever of the need to integrate competitions such as the African Nations Cup and Gold Cup into the world soccer calendar more smoothly. In view of the tremendous talent in the countries concerned - and especially throughout Africa - the potential problems for clubs prepared to give players the chance to make a name for themselves in the more traditional professional football strongholds can surely only get bigger. I have to admit that the challenge of harmonising the commitments of national teams with those of club sides would not be something I'd like to tackle.

After that he carried on playing in the United States for the Tampa Bay Rowdies, scoring 48 goals in 94 games between 1976-79, and coached New York United and Carolina Lightnin' before club football in the US 'folded under the strain of not being competitive'. The eve of a meeting between two of his old clubs - Manchester City against Fulham in today's key First Division fixture at Maine Road - seemed an appropriate moment to invite him to indulge in a little reflection and he proved the most amiable of company over coffee in a cafe close to his Wimbledon home - before driving off in his Porsche to play tennis. </p> <p>Marsh's surprisingly modest haul of nine international caps almost certainly reflected his insistence on playing his own game. Was he, perhaps, a difficult player to coach? 'I was an impossible player to coach.

That sounds arrogant, I know, but that's the way I looked at football. They were all there as extras in a play, and I was the star. They had to come along to be my supporting cast. But that's a negative thing as well.' </p> <p>Returning to the subject later, he says: 'I always felt that coaching was only for certain players. I didn't believe that coaching was for me. Creative players cannot be restricted to doing mundane team things. You have to let talented players like Glenn Hoddle or Matthew Le Tissier play.

'What I learnt particularly from him was passing, long-range and short-range. He always had the same attitude, he was never sloppy. He hit a 50-yard pass with the same deliberation that he hit a five-yard pass. His standards were incredibly high, both in what he asked of himself and of others.' </p> <p>But it is as a maverick genius that Marsh will be best remembered, the man who arrived at Manchester City in March 1972 when the club were leading the First Division and proved such a disconcerting presence that they were caught by the pack. Accurate? </p> <p>'Very accurate. I changed the way Manchester City played football. When I joined them they were a well-oiled machine, well coordinated, well organised. But what they didn't have, and I hate to say this, was star quality and that was what I was supposed to provide. And although I provided it, it was to the detriment of team play. They started to play around me and we lost the focus of what we were trying to do.

He says that although he remains loyally British - 'You can take the boy out of the East Ender, but you can't take the East Ender out of the boy' - he cannot help liking the quality of life in America. 'It's what I call the 5.30 syndrome. At 5.30[pm] in London on any given day it's usually overcast and damp and you're either on your way home from work or in the pub.

As an extension of his son's businesses he has helped to set up a management company in Britain that will take Soccer Saturday on the road, starting with a show in Camberley on 2 March. The project will, incidentally, support the Bobby Moore Fund for Imperial Cancer Research. </p> <p>Marsh's has already been a rich and varied life, and there is more to come.

'If the foreign games were good, the Brazilian fans would have stayed to watch,' he wrote in a newspaper column last week. 'But they weren't. United came here to drink whisky, make the most of the sun and see if our liquor is as good as theirs. What they did was a joke.

But Miranda's famed arrogance may now have backfired: it seems his misbehaviour at the Maracana last Wednesday has cost Brazil, and Gerson, their dream of playing host to the 2006 World Cup. </p> <p>The incident came after Vasco's 2-1 win over Necaxa when Miranda's son was refused entry into the team dressing room by Fifa officials. His father reacted by setting Vasco's 'security men' on the officials, leaving chief media officer Ricardo Setyon with a dislocated shoulder. Fifa confirmed that Miranda, who last year caused a match to be abandoned when his men tried to attack a referee, will now face disciplinary action. </p> <p>Fifa have also taken note of the way supporters seeking tickets for last Friday's final were dealt with: four ticket windows opened for 40,000 hot, angry supporters, resulting in several injuries. 'This is normal,' admitted the Brazilian Football Confederation afterwards, 'there was big demand.' United's efforts in Rio on behalf of the England 2006 campaign may well have been 'rubbish' - but Brazil have left their own bid dead in the water. </p> <p><strong>George, come home</strong> </p> <p>George Weah's former Milan team-mates have asked the striker - on loan at Chelsea - to 'come home'. The request came just one day after Weah began by scoring the winner against Spurs. On the same night, Milan lost 3-2 to Inter . 'The players at Milan want me back,' says George. 'I spoke to some of them on the telephone after Wednesday's game and Paolo [Maldini] said: \"We need you back and we miss you\", and that I was good for the team. They said they hoped I could come back as soon as possible.' </p> <p><strong>Wide-eyed Hammer misses the point</strong> </p> <p>First Alex Ferguson tried to lure teenage sensation Joe Cole away from Upton Park. Now Newcastle United president Sir John Hall wants to do the same with Michael Carrick, the latest adolescent prodigy to emerge from the Hammers' youth scheme. When the Irons visited St James' Park on 3 January, Hall came into their dressing room before kick-off. He chatted to Shaka Hislop, the keeper he released to West Ham, before asking: 'So where's this lad Michael Carrick everybody's talking about?' Once he found the youngster, our sources explain, Hall enthusiastically extolled the virtues of Newcastle as a club and city to the attentive 18-year-old. Carrick, who was coveted by all of the North-East's big three as a product of Wallsend Boys Club where Alan Shearer and Peter Beardsley honed their skills, engaged in polite conversation with his elderly admirer. Hall, however, will be crushed to learn that as soon as he left, Carrick turned to his team-mates and asked: 'Who was that, then?' </p> <p><strong>Betis lock-in latest</strong> </p> <p>Desperate times in the primera division. Spanish side Betis, just two points off the relegation zone, have been locked inside a hotel by their furious president until they win a league game. The imprisonment, agreed by Manuel Ruiz de Lopera with coach Carlos Griguol, came after Betis crashed out of the cup on Wednesday to tiny second division Merida. It's the latest in several attempts to get the team in order - de Lopera has already tried offering win bonuses of between \u00a310,000 and \u00a340,000 per player, but all to no effect. The players' first chance to get out of jail comes this afternoon against Athletic de Bilbao. </p> <p><strong>Anelka: French rap music and me</strong> </p> <p>With Nicolas Anelka now injured for two months (video footage of his operation available on the internet at <a href=\"http://www.marca.es/video/anelka_operacion.mov\">http://www.marca.es/</a> he's found plenty of time to maintain his own personal web-site, <a href=\"http://www.nicolasanelka.net.Free\">www.nicolasanelka.net.Free</a> from the 'interfering medium' of press interpretation, Nicolas speaks directly to his many fans about why he left Arsenal. 'The Arsenal players really drove me crazy. They would never let me play my French rap music, which they ought to have done because it is so good.' Nicolas also explains why he took and missed the penalty that cost Real Madrid victory over Corinthians - it was his agent-brother Didier's idea: 'Besides, Hierro had missed a couple and Savio, next in line, was hesitating. So I had a go. Anyway, we drew 2-2 and both goals were mine'.</p>",

George, come home George Weah's former Milan team-mates have asked the striker - on loan at Chelsea - to 'come home'. The request came just one day after Weah began by scoring the winner against Spurs. On the same night, Milan lost 3-2 to Inter . 'The players at Milan want me back,' says George. 'I spoke to some of them on the telephone after Wednesday's game and Paolo [Maldini] said: \"We need you back and we miss you\", and that I was good for the team. They said they hoped I could come back as soon as possible.' Wide-eyed Hammer misses the point First Alex Ferguson tried to lure teenage sensation Joe Cole away from Upton Park. Now Newcastle United president Sir John Hall wants to do the same with Michael Carrick, the latest adolescent prodigy to emerge from the Hammers' youth scheme. When the Irons visited St James' Park on 3 January, Hall came into their dressing room before kick-off. He chatted to Shaka Hislop, the keeper he released to West Ham, before asking: 'So where's this lad Michael Carrick everybody's talking about?' Once he found the youngster, our sources explain, Hall enthusiastically extolled the virtues of Newcastle as a club and city to the attentive 18-year-old. Carrick, who was coveted by all of the North-East's big three as a product of Wallsend Boys Club where Alan Shearer and Peter Beardsley honed their skills, engaged in polite conversation with his elderly admirer. Hall, however, will be crushed to learn that as soon as he left, Carrick turned to his team-mates and asked: 'Who was that, then?' Betis lock-in latest Desperate times in the primera division. Spanish side Betis, just two points off the relegation zone, have been locked inside a hotel by their furious president until they win a league game. The imprisonment, agreed by Manuel Ruiz de Lopera with coach Carlos Griguol, came after Betis crashed out of the cup on Wednesday to tiny second division Merida. It's the latest in several attempts to get the team in order - de Lopera has already tried offering win bonuses of between \u00a310,000 and \u00a340,000 per player, but all to no effect. The players' first chance to get out of jail comes this afternoon against Athletic de Bilbao. Anelka: French rap music and me With Nicolas Anelka now injured for two months (video footage of his operation available on the internet at http://www.marca.es/ he's found plenty of time to maintain his own personal web-site, www.nicolasanelka.net.Free from the 'interfering medium' of press interpretation, Nicolas speaks directly to his many fans about why he left Arsenal. 'The Arsenal players really drove me crazy. They would never let me play my French rap music, which they ought to have done because it is so good.' Nicolas also explains why he took and missed the penalty that cost Real Madrid victory over Corinthians - it was his agent-brother Didier's idea: 'Besides, Hierro had missed a couple and Savio, next in line, was hesitating. So I had a go. Anyway, we drew 2-2 and both goals were mine'.",

The day after the tie, when the animosity towards Omoyinmi was inevitably at its most pronounced, some of the numerous media telephone calls to Laws did not even get past the Scunthorpe switchboard operator. </p> <p>'Are you ringing him about the West Ham player?' she asked.

Then Vladimir Smicer popped up with a winner for a wasteful Liverpool. </p> <p>Smicer has been at Liverpool all season as Steve McManaman's replacement but you would never know it - yesterday saw the Czech's first goal for the club to give them a welcome three points after recent stumblings. It was a little hard on the 22-year-old Icelander signed from Lillestrom and his spirited team, but still they gift goals. </p> <p>Theoretically, this should have been a fixture to soothe Liverpool after the shock to the system of defeat by Blackburn Rovers, especially with Michael Owen back after a hamstring injury. That overlooked the fact Chelsea had been beaten here by a side scrapping for their lives and that Watford had won 1-0 at Anfield in August to record their first Premiership points. </p> <p>That Liverpool were given the early fillip they needed to restore some confidence - they had also lost to Tottenham before Blackburn to end a run of four wins in five unbeaten matches - said much about why Watford have taken root in the bottom three since the Anfield win. </p> <p>Patrik Berger sent in a poor low cross from the right, but the Watford defence merely dabbled with it instead of dealing with it decisively. Up it bobbled to David Thompson and all 5ft 7in of him twice won headers before it fell to Owen. He picked out Berger for a more emphatic low attempt, this time into the back of the net. </p> <p>Initially Liverpool had looked bright enough, with Dieter Hamann the puppetmaster in midfield as they assembled some neat passing movements, but there was a hesitancy to them. Owen looked concerned, naturally enough, about stretching out his legs, and at the back they were clearly nervous about conceding early on, having lost the previous two games by a single goal. </p> <p>Helguson had made his first impact on the game with a header into the side-netting from Charlie Miller's free-kick and Richard Johnson was not far wide with a drive from 20 yards. The goal, however, served to douse home spirits and lift Liverpool's. </p> <p>Berger might have doubled the lead when Hamann slid a beautifully weighted ball into his path, but as Alec Chamberlain dived at his feet, he clipped the ball wide. Berger then played an equally astute pass into the stride of Owen, now beginning to relax, but although his shot fizzed past the goalkeeper, it rebounded from the crossbar. </p> <p>The second goal Liverpool had threatened duly came just before the interval. Johnson fouled Titi Camara, for which he was booked, some 35 yards out and as Hamann's low shot was bound for goal, Thompson intervened to deflect it past a wrong-footed Chamberlain. </p> <p>Johnson quickly made amends, however. Receiving the ball some 25 yards out, he took a step and drilled in a low shot which found the corner of Sander Westerveld's net. From looking comfortable, suddenly Liverpool looked vulnerable. </p> <p>Watford clearly scented it too. Within 30 seconds of the restart they won a free-kick on Liverpool's left and David Perpetuini swung in a curling left-footed kick. Helguson escaped Sami Hyypia and rose to meet it ahead of Westerveld, glancing the ball home with his head. </p> <p>Now Watford were steaming, looking like one of Graham Taylor's direct old teams in forcing Liverpool to turn with long balls, and winning the knock-downs, all fuelled by adrenaline. Luckily for Liverpool, there is not the same quality in this Watford side and gradually they eased themselves back in the game. </p> <p>After a mazy run across the penalty area, Owen sent in a shot that Miller kicked off the line. Steven Gerrard also headed at Chamberlain and Thompson was close with a 20-yard shot. Then came that decisive contribution by Smicer. From wide on the right, Owen picked him out. From the pass, Smicer looked up and deliberately slotted a low shot just inside Chamberlain's left post.

It was soon three, Schwarzer fumbling a harmless long ball from Johnson and the irrepressible Christie was there to pinch possession, dribble round the keeper and find the net from an acute angle. It was symptomatic of Boro's dreadful afternoon when Hamilton Ricard's lazily struck penalty for a foul by Horacio Carbonari was saved by Mart Poom. Consolation came in the 71st minute when substitute Andy Campbell fastened on to a loose ball in the area and volleyed in from 15-yards. Then, in the final minute, Craig Burley, in yards of space, completed Boro's rout with a goal scored with something approaching arrogance.",

Several types of social security benefit have already been cut back under the last Government and the current one, and there will be further reductions. Protection once provided by the state must now be provided by individuals.Tanner says: 'There is something worrying about the fact that so many people have no money for if they become unemployed.' </p> <p>Tanner says the truth, for many people, is that they simply do not have enough money to save any of it. The IFS is conducting further research into saving through focus groups, where people are questioned about their saving habits. 'The interesting thing that emerges among low-income households is that they save for Christmas or birthdays rather than for the long term.' </p> <p>People on lower incomes also wonder whether it is worthwhile saving if the sum they accumulate will merely disqualify them from receiving state help through means-tested benefits. Income support, for example, is not payable to anyone with savings of more than \u00a38,000. Savings between \u00a33,000 and \u00a38,000 will bring reductions in benefit and only those with less than \u00a33,000 get the maximum benefit.

The current government has added to the complexity by scrapping the Tories' tax-free schemes, Peps and Tessas, and replacing them with the Individual Savings Account. For some, saving would be possible, but requires effort. In the Birmingham Midshires survey a third of respondents recognised that saving was important, but said they found it too easy to spend. Saving money can be hard graft unless you are a natural penny-pincher. But there are reasons to make a start: </p> <p> \u0095 There is likely to be less help from the state for welfare in future than is available even now. A cushion of savings can enable you to make choices about your life. </p> <p> \u0095 Saving enough to allow you to survive without work for a time can give you the freedom to throw in a job you hate, or work part-time, perhaps, while finding something better, or gaining new skills. </p> <p> \u0095 Savings can give financial flexibility. For example, savings may allow you to cut the cost of insurance by choosing to insure fewer possessions on the basis that if you were burgled, or the possessions damaged, you could afford to replace them. This will always be a gamble, but in areas where insurance is expensive, it may be one worth taking. Similarly, private medical insurance is beyond the reach of many people and seems an expensive millstone to others. But hospitals will increasingly offer fixed-fee treatment if you have the cash. </p> <p>\u0095 Most of the best mortgage deals are available to people who can put down substantial deposits. First-time buyers should try to save a deposit. </p> <p> \u0095 If you develop a savings habit early, you may set yourself up for building relatively effortless wealth in future. Motley Fool, the Internet-based financial information service, gives the fictional example of a couple with very different savings patterns: Fay invests \u00a3100 a month in a fund tracking the stock market throughout her twenties and stops in her early thirties when she has children. Husband Ferdinand, a former Hooray Henry who likes to spend, does not start saving until he is 30, putting \u00a3100 from then on into the same index tracker fund as diligent Fay. But Fay leaves her money to grow until she is 60, when she has \u00a31.3 million, against Ferdinand's \u00a3489,000. The figures assume stock market growth of 14 per cent a year, which is a reasonable reflection of the past, but not necessarily the future.

If you had invested \u00a3250 a month since 1975 in one of the largest stock market funds for small investors, you would be in the same happy situation. So much for the lottery. Eat your heart out, Chris Tarrant. The idea of saving is not as beguiling as that of instant, effortless wealth, but small sums saved regularly in the right place can make a difference to your life in the long run.However, if you are not a natural saver, you can take some comfort from the knowledge that you are not alone. Research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies showed last year that half the population has less than \u00a3750 in savings accounts and investments. About one in 10 households has no savings at all.

What's true, even? Why couldn't you get to the information you wanted straight away?</p> <p>The main shortcoming of our information culture is not the availability of 'facts', but their quality and relevance to you. Information overload, also known as the now medically recognised 'information fatigue syndrome', is the new flu. (Trust me here.) We're bombarded by news, faxes, phone-calls, emails, and the junk equivalent of all of these, until the information we need to operate eludes us.

We have too much information thrown at us - more than we know what to do with. Occupational psychologist Professor Cary Cooper recognises that stress, RSI and eye damage are all part of the problem we face. 'It results in a lack of mental wellbeing as it takes us away from other people,' he says. 'We're not sustaining our relationships, and, sedentary, we get no exercise.' We live in an age where information, whether it's delivered on the dirty pages of an ever-widening newspaper or on a gaudy, repetitive cable station, is measured by volume as opposed to quality - the final word in style over content.</p> <p>Here's some information about information: The script for a 30-minute broadcast by CNN would barely fill the front page of a newspaper. A weekday edition of a newspaper contains as much information as the average person in the 17th century would be exposed to in their entire lifetime. In 1971 the average American encountered 560 advertising messages a day; by 1997 that had grown to 3,000. Gallup and the Institute For The Future calculated last year that the average British working day consists of 171 messages, 46 phone-calls, 22 emails, 15 internal memos and 19 items of external post.</p> <p>Even Ted Turner, head of CNN, one of data smog's biggest proponents, thinks the info-glut has gone too far. 'It's killing people,' he said, not unconnectedly at the launch of CNN's new Custom News service, which will filter the news to your own tastes.</p> <p>A number of ailments beset the modern worker, such as busy lethargy, where the sheer number of things to be done results in indecision and inaction. Dr David Lewis, a psychologist who has recently published a book, Information Overload, recognises that the 'sheer volume of information we have to deal with daily means that work stress spills out into home life, our sex drive is impaired, we cut back on sleep, and our heads become so full of data that we find it hard to sleep'. The final result of this can be Burnout Stress Syndrome (BOSS) that was formerly most common amongst psychiatric nurses in the States. 'As deadlines get tighter due to the speed of information, people are always inclined to feel the information they have is out of date.'</p> <p>He refers to one financial director who installed a new system as it gave him a 100th of a second on his competitors; he's also met a manager who rather cynically referred to the fact that 'there wasn't always enough time to do something right, but always enough to do it again'. So surely there is a solution? He isn't optimistic: 'There isn't one,' says Lewis. The information glut isn't going away, so it's vital that we become better at managing it.</p> <p><b>Recognising if you're experiencing overload</b></p> <p><b>1.</b> Many of us may have become so used to a daily glut of information that it's hard to accept that something is amiss. One simple test is, at the end of the day, to pause and try to recollect every instance when you were exposed to information that you'll still need tomorrow. How much of it can you remember in detail? If you can't remember all of it, then something has to change.</p> <p><b>2.</b> Do you take work, or related reading material, to bed with you? If so, you are not handling your information properly during the day.</p> <p><b>3.</b> Do you find individual names, numbers, or ideas blur together, or get mixed up with each other? For example, do you call James Bradley by the name James Tuck, simply as he's the person you've been reading about all afternoon?</p> <p><b>4.</b> Do you overcomplicate issues by immersing them in details? 'It's about getting to the core of the matter,' says Lewis. 'Einstein said \"Simplify, simplify.\" We tend to drown in detail, and fear leads us towards perfectionism.' The details some of us crave can simply contribute to the overload.</p> <p><b>5.</b> Do you feel as if you are wasting time when you are just sitting somewhere and not reading? Some perceive such moments as idleness, but essentially, the brain needs time to assimilate some of the day's intake, as opposed to be flooded with more information.</p> <p><b>Handling Information Overload at home</b></p> <p><b>1.</b> Turn off the television for two hours every day. This is a simple way of stopping pointless information slipping into your subconscious. And it might stop you whistling inane theme tunes, too.</p> <p><b>2.</b> Spend some time of every week with your mobile phone and pager switched off. Ensure that you can't be contacted and give yourself time to clear your mind. If something's that urgent, then someone will be able to find you in person, or deal with the matter themselves.</p> <p><b>3.</b> Go on what David Shenk calls 'data fasts'. Take a week in the country away from all the noise to clear your head. Take a big novel with you, preferably by an austere Russian from the 19th century.</p> <p><b>4.</b> Cary Cooper suggests we ensure that in our time off we spend time with people 'the one thing that info overload often deprives us of. This can take many forms - you might even try leaving work at 3.30pm to pick up kids from school. You can then work at home, or return to the office, if you must.'</p> <p><b>5.</b> Realise that the overload affects everyone and your performance is best enhanced by learning to ignore parts of it.</p> <p><b>Clearing the data smog at work</b></p> <p><b>1.</b> Your email program can be set to filter your emails. For example, junk can go in one file (say the trash), personal messages can fill another, and messages from your boss can drop into the 'urgent' folder. It will help save you time as you avoid reading messages that could be saved until later or ignored.</p> <p><b>2.</b> Rip out the magazine articles and newsletters that you really want to read. Once they're detached from the main body of the publication, you don't run the risk of reading the same useless stuff again, by accident.</p> <p><b>3.</b> Learn to ignore junk emails and unsolicited messages. You might miss something, true, but in the long run you'll be more focused and effective. Go through this procedure with every email message you receive: Read, Action, Forward, Trash (RAFT). Don't leave the message sitting in your inbox - take action on it immediately so as not to open the same messages more than once.</p> <p><b>4.</b> Employers should recognise that people are not computers and that mistakes are more likely to occur under extreme pressure, says Professor Cooper.</p> <p><b>5.</b> Learn how to use search engines efficiently. Most have help sections that will teach you how to search best.</p> <p><b>How not to contribute to the smog</b></p> <p><b>1.</b> Always think about how best to contact someone. Is the information best delivered as a voicemail message, an email, or a fax? Or can you just drop it in the post? What's quickest, likely to be the most direct, and efficient?</p> <p><b>2.</b> Write economically and concisely. Don't be verbose as this simply wastes everyone's time.</p> <p><b>3.</b> Change the words in the subject field of an email. This helps suggest how the conversation has moved on, so the recipient can briefly assess whether they have to read the message now or later. Blank subject fields and 'Re:' messages are often ignored.</p> <p><b>4.</b> Do not forward chain letters, urban legends, urgent messages about email viruses, or claims that Bill Gates will send everyone thousands of dollars. These things clog up inboxes with worthless stuff.</p> <p><b>5.</b> Check the 'To:' field of your emails. This will mean that unnecessary recipients will not receive irrelevant emails, and that you'll save the embarrassment of sending someone a private message.</p>",

Go on what David Shenk calls 'data fasts'. Take a week in the country away from all the noise to clear your head. Take a big novel with you, preferably by an austere Russian from the 19th century. 4. Cary Cooper suggests we ensure that in our time off we spend time with people 'the one thing that info overload often deprives us of. This can take many forms - you might even try leaving work at 3.30pm to pick up kids from school. You can then work at home, or return to the office, if you must.' 5. Realise that the overload affects everyone and your performance is best enhanced by learning to ignore parts of it. Clearing the data smog at work 1. Your email program can be set to filter your emails. For example, junk can go in one file (say the trash), personal messages can fill another, and messages from your boss can drop into the 'urgent' folder. It will help save you time as you avoid reading messages that could be saved until later or ignored. 2. Rip out the magazine articles and newsletters that you really want to read. Once they're detached from the main body of the publication, you don't run the risk of reading the same useless stuff again, by accident. 3. Learn to ignore junk emails and unsolicited messages. You might miss something, true, but in the long run you'll be more focused and effective. Go through this procedure with every email message you receive: Read, Action, Forward, Trash (RAFT). Don't leave the message sitting in your inbox - take action on it immediately so as not to open the same messages more than once. 4. Employers should recognise that people are not computers and that mistakes are more likely to occur under extreme pressure, says Professor Cooper. 5. Learn how to use search engines efficiently. Most have help sections that will teach you how to search best. How not to contribute to the smog 1. Always think about how best to contact someone. Is the information best delivered as a voicemail message, an email, or a fax? Or can you just drop it in the post? What's quickest, likely to be the most direct, and efficient? 2. Write economically and concisely. Don't be verbose as this simply wastes everyone's time. 3. Change the words in the subject field of an email. This helps suggest how the conversation has moved on, so the recipient can briefly assess whether they have to read the message now or later. Blank subject fields and 'Re:' messages are often ignored. 4. Do not forward chain letters, urban legends, urgent messages about email viruses, or claims that Bill Gates will send everyone thousands of dollars. These things clog up inboxes with worthless stuff. 5. Check the 'To:' field of your emails. This will mean that unnecessary recipients will not receive irrelevant emails, and that you'll save the embarrassment of sending someone a private message.",

      "body": "<p>What is life coaching? Life coaching is the newest, fastest and most effective way to reassess and rework any area of your life. What a personal trainer does for your body, a life coach does for the rest of your life. Your coach will meet you, get to know you, discover what areas of your life you feel dissatisfied or confused about, then help you develop a strategy for improving them.</p> <p>After an initial meeting, most coaching is done by telephone, with your coach pushing you, encouraging you and generally watching over you, making sure that you turn your plans into action.</p> <p>Coaching is not therapy. 'Coaching is more pragmatic and goal-orientated,' says Eileen Mulligan, our life coach for this series. 'We don't focus on the roots of problems, but on their solutions.' Whatever your problems, the techniques of life coaching can help you become your own life coach, and give you new and effective ways to deal with them.</p> <p><b>Before you begin</b></p> <p>Most of us experience some kind of issues in our family lives. No matter what your problem, it is very important to have boundaries in your family relationships. These will be the boundaries you set for yourself - what you do and don't want to do/be/engage with in your family - and the boundaries that other family members set.</p> <p>Much of this lesson is about understanding what you want your boundaries to be, and finding appropriate ways of establishing them. If you can achieve this, it gives you an excellent framework for resolving individual problems and disputes.</p> <p><b>The list</b></p> <p>Every life-coaching lesson begins with the list. On a piece of paper write down these five headings: goals, personal strengths, immediate challenges/blocks/problems, development skills, achievements.</p> <p>Whatever area of your life you have issues with, Eileen divides it up into these five key areas. That helps you get a real picture of where you are, where you want to be, what stands in the way of your getting there, and what tools you may already have - or need to acquire - to overcome your obstacles. As we are dealing with family issues this week, Eileen recommends that you fill in your list using these guidelines:</p> <p><b>Goals</b></p> <p>These should always be positive, so: 'I want to spend more time with my children', not 'I don't want to work such long hours'. Even if your family issue is a negative one, you need to express your goal as a positive. For example, if you feel that your family wants too much of your time and attention, don't express it as 'I want to spend less time with my family', but 'I want to make more time for myself'.</p> <p>Your goals should also relate directly to you and your issues, and not to anyone else, so: 'I want to resolve an argument with my brother', not 'I want my brother to stop treating me like a child'. And remember that you can't make goals for other people, only for yourself. The kind of goals to avoid might include: 'I want my child to do well in exams', 'I want my family to be less demanding', or 'I want my parents to get on better'. Some other family goals might include: 'Improve my relationship with my in-laws', 'Spend more/less time with my parents', 'Have children'.</p> <p><b>Personal strengths</b></p> <p>Look for the strengths that help to support your goals and that will help you overcome your challenges. If your problem is a difficult relationship with your stepchildren, or an overbearing mother, your strength could be your willingness to work through the problem.</p> <p>If you have qualities such as patience, or acceptance of others' points of view, or a commitment to resolving problems, you could also list these. Other strengths might include: 'I love children', 'I make an effort to get on with all my siblings', 'I accept that my family don't have to agree with my views and opinions'. It's important to be aware of your personal strengths in family situations, where disputes and problems can cause feelings of guilt or low self-worth.<br></p> <p><b>Immediate challenges/blocks/problems</b></p> <p>This is your list of what is making you most unhappy, or frustrated, or confused about your family. It's very important to keep your focus on the issues that directly affect you - that way you will be able to find a solution.</p> <p>If your problem is 'caused' by someone else, you have to turn it around to see it as it affects you. So your problem is not 'My mother nags me and makes me feel inadequate', but 'I allow my mother to make me feel inadequate'.</p> <p><b>Development skills</b></p> <p>Your development skills are areas where you can develop and improve, and gives you ways to go forward. Focus again on the kind of skills that you will need to overcome your problems and achieve your goals, and which relate to the issues you are dealing with.</p> <p>As we are looking at family issues, some suggestions might include: 'Learn to say \"no\" more', 'Become less affected by family opinion', 'Ask for help when I need it', 'Accept other people as they are', etc. This sounds much easier to say than to do, but acquiring a new set of development skills gives you a new set of tools for dealing with your problems.</p> <p>If you feel that you can't get these development skills by yourself, look for ways to get help. You can start by reading around your particular area: notice articles in the press that seem relevant; there are some excellent books that can help; or you might choose to take a course, or even see a professional. Once you know what development skills you want to have, you can find ways to get them.</p> <p><b>Achievements</b></p> <p>No matter what state your family relationships are in, you will have achievements you can feel proud of. Do you see your family for Christmas and holidays although you don't really want to? Your achievement could be: 'I am committed to keeping in touch with my family'. Do you disagree with your siblings' views or lifestyle? Your achievement might be: 'I accept that my siblings are different to me'. Or perhaps: 'I have kept my family together', or 'I am always there for my children', or perhaps 'I have shown that I have the strength to live without some of my family members'.</p> <p>Add to your achievement list as you go through the process of working on your problems. Family relationships are complicated, and it is normal to experience setbacks along the way. Listing your achievements helps you see the progress you are making, even in the difficult times, and helps to put your problems in perspective.</p> <p><b>Finding Solutions</b></p> <p>Think about your problem and then ask yourself these questions: How does this affect me? Is this really my problem? How can I turn the situation around? Am I taking too much responsibility for the situation? Am I dealing with the problem generally, or the affect the problem is having on me?</p> <p>You need to see your problem in a way that gives you control over it, and allows you to influence the outcome. Asking these questions, and keeping the focus on you and the effect it has on you, helps to do this.</p> <p>One of the most common family problems is: 'My family is too demanding'. Looked at that way, it seems as if you have very little control over your problem. You can't change your family, so... But look at it another way. Start by dealing with the effects of this problem, which you can control. For instance, you could choose to be less affected by family pressure. At present you are taking responsibility for your family's demands, and allowing yourself to be affected by that pressure. Maybe that's one part of the problem you haven't considered until now.</p> <p>Here are some techniques for breaking down this particular problem:</p> <p>\u0095 Make a list of the ways your family puts pressure on you.</p> <p>\u0095 Divide the list into the pressures you think are reasonable and unreasonable.</p> <p>\u0095 At the bottom of the first list write 'This is what I'm prepared to take on' and at the bottom of the second one 'This is what I'm not prepared to take on'.</p> <p>\u0095 Using your list, start to write out some boundaries. For example, 'I will make myself available for these family functions', 'I will not take non-urgent calls at work from my family'. This will clarify in your mind exactly which aspects of your family's demands you find most burdensome. If you aren't clear, you may have been sending out mixed signals.</p> <p>\u0095 If some family members put you under more pressure than others, write down who they are. Look for patterns. Do other family members get the same treatment as you? Do they always use the same techniques to make you feel guilty?</p> <p>\u0095 If you can see patterns, write them down, then list ways you could break them.</p> <p>\u0095 Once you're clear on what you want the boundaries to be, find ways to communicate them to your family. 'No' may be enough. Using this technique, you reduce your problem to a series of smaller challenges which can then be dealt with in turn.</p> <p><b>Final checklist</b></p> <p>\u0095 You may have aspirations for other family members, but remember that they have their own goals.</p> <p>\u0095 Set clear boundaries. It's up to you to say what you do and don't want.</p> <p>\u0095 Respect the boundaries of others.</p> <p>\u0095 If you decide on a solution to a problem, be prepared to take the consequences.</p> <p>\u0095 Break your problems into pieces.</p> <p>\u0095 Remember that you don't have to take responsibility for everyone else's problems.</p> <p><b>Michael's story</b></p> <p><b>Eileen (the coach)</b></p> <p>Michael is in his mid-30s and came to see me because he felt that his family was too big an influence on him, and holding him back from becoming his own person. He is the youngest of six children, in what he describes as a close and loving group. His father was a problem for the family, being a bullying and dogmatic person.</p> <p>Michael felt that the negative influence of his father had served to 'bond' the siblings even more, creating an 'us and him' situation. Michael felt that one sister and brother in particular had taken on more parental roles in his life as he was growing up, and that those roles continued to some degree to this day.</p> <p>Although very fond of them, he felt that he relied too much on their approval. He is a writer and musician - as he talked about this, his hand would often move towards his heart, indicating how passionately he felt about this. But there is a family tradition of writers, and he often felt overshadowed, that he made choices about work designed more to live up to the family group than to follow his own desires.</p> <p>When he wrote out a list of his personal core values, passion was his number one, indicating that trying to please his family - and not himself - was causing him a lot of personal conflict. Although Michael felt he had a family problem, being able to acknowledge and pursue his own passions in his own way was his biggest issue.</p> <p>We set a series of goals which involved him producing work independently of his family. He would not show anyone this work until it was ready for publication or recording, as he has a tendency to seek approval for his ideas before embarking on them. Although money is not a core value for him, we also agreed that he would contact an agent and establish a good monetary value for his work. This would give him a sense of self-worth, legitimacy and value about his own work within the family.</p> <p><b>Michael (the client) </b></p> <p>My family is very close; sometimes I think we're too close . On the one hand, I really like that, but I also find it claustrophobic. I like and admire my siblings, and I've always sought their input and approval for my ideas and work. But if they didn't like or believe in something, it would put me off, even where it was something I loved. I felt I was still too dependent on them for everything.</p> <p>Talking to Eileen about values and boundaries made me see that my real area of difficulty with my family is with my work. There's a lot of creativity in the family, and also a lot of professional success. I need to ignore that, and just walk my own path.</p> <p>Setting the goals worked for me in two ways: one, it made me see just what my problem is and how simple it could be to fix, as I'd got bogged down in all the ins and outs of our family relationships and couldn't separate exactly what bothered me and what didn't.</p> <p>And two, the goals produced a set of tasks, including writing an outline for a novel and finding an agent, both of which I've done. I'm usually a terrible procrastinator so I'm really impressed with myself being able to achieve so much so fast. It's something I wanted to do for ages, but it was the thought of having to phone Eileen and say I hadn't done it that made me do it.</p>",

To keep fit he is riding his bicycle. Morgan, who qualified as a solicitor 18 months ago, says he is not a natural saver. 'My family has always saved, but I was the black sheep in that I always spent.' Morgan has a mortgage and does not have a lot of money to spare each month. But he was not using his gym membership, so decided to divert the money into saving. 'If I don't, I spend everything in the account every month. I am getting older and need to start putting a bit of money aside instead of spending it every month. Every job has the potential for stopping, and I would like a bit of a safety net.' Morgan chose a cash Isa because he was concerned about the risk involved in stock market investment. He also wanted instant access to his money.",

      "body": "<p>We meet the morning after the Bridget Jones party in the central London offices of Freud Communications, the PR company he set up in 1985. Freud is dressed in a black jumper, black casual trousers and black boots. One TV presenter had described him to me as 'the most exhausted-looking person in public life'. Yet he looks in better shape than the previous night, more relaxed, fresher faced, younger, even.</p> <p>He talks in the west London demotic common to thrusting media and music executives, a kind of downbeat earthiness interspersed with sales jargon. For instance, of his growing profile in the press, he says: 'I've had awareness before, but never anything approaching equity.'</p> <p>Another sign of his salesmanship is a conversational tic of asking rhetorical questions to which he then supplies pithy answers. 'Is there such a thing as bad publicity? Fuck, yes.'</p> <p>He is bright, rather than intellectual, and, deliberately or not, has successfully shed any vestiges of his public school education at St Anthony's prep school in Hampstead and Westminster. At 36, he is still youthful, at least in terms of the business world. He has talked about leaving public relations by the time he turns 40. 'Old PR men are deeply sad individuals. I don't think I would want to spend my life in a derivative business.' He has also made clear his reservations about the fame game, speaking of the 'primary narcissism of many celebrities'. Piers Morgan, for one, is highly doubtful that Freud's future lies elsewhere. 'He likes to think of himself as an internet entrepreneur but he's the Alastair Campbell of showbusiness: ruthless but sharp. I think he's a serial networker, a social butterfly who loves to be around celebrities.'</p> <p>Freud, it should be said, does not give the impression of someone who is starry-eyed. He's too clever for that. He talks about celebrity dispassionately, in terms of 'equity' and 'leverage'. His expertise lies in encouraging a brand to buy into the equity of a celebrity's fame, thus enabling Freud to leverage editorial exposure for both the brand and the celebrity. It's an arrangement that he first perfected, spectacularly, with the publicity surrounding the opening of Planet Hollywood in London in 1992.</p> <p>Before that launch, showbusiness was largely a contained enterprise. Afterwards, it leaked into everything - drenching the tabloids and diluting the broadsheet agenda, spreading like a stain across the TV schedules, T-shirts, baseball caps and hamburgers. The effect was that the public's appetite for celebrity stories grew swiftly more bulimic on a diet of manufactured publicity.</p> <p>Of course, Planet Hollywood was not the first showbusiness concern to shift merchandise, but it was the most self-conscious and deliberate and, arguably, the first to have no other purpose, artistic or otherwise, than to shift merchandise. In Freud's words: 'It was the ultimate transfer of celebrity equity into a T-shirt.'</p> <p>Morgan, who was then the Sun 's showbusiness reporter, can recall the seismic effect of the opening night. 'It was the biggest party London had seen for 20 years and Matthew handled it with aplomb. There was Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Eddie Murphy, Bruce Willis, Michael Douglas, to name but a few. That was the moment that people started to take Matthew seriously. We splashed on it in the Sun.'</p> <p>A couple of months ago, Planet Hollywood announced that it had gone bust. Freud laughs when I ask if he still represents the company. 'Er, yeah. I mean, that's a fantastic story. It's a parable of empty foundations. Celebrities were brought in to kick-start something that otherwise would have taken a long time. So you went from nothing to an overnight sensation by transplanting all these famous people on to a logo. Planet Hollywood went from nothing to a $3.5 billion operation to nothing again in a seven-year period. The fact is, the tabloids were completely conspiratorial in building the Planet Hollywood brand, because we gave them something they'd never had before, which was absolutely unfettered access to huge celebrities who would do almost anything to sell a burger and a T-shirt. It was remarkable to see these titans of the screen throwing out baseball caps to crowds and saying the apple strudel's really good.'</p> <p>In some ways, the rise and fall of Planet Hollywood traces the arc of our obsession with celebrity. It probably peaked mid-decade, but while it hasn't yet fizzled out, there are signs that interest is waning. First of all, the celebrities themselves are becoming smaller and more transient, as they vainly attempt to fill the space created by that initial Planet Hollywood blitzkrieg, and secondly, the tabloids are beginning to step back from the frenzied overexposure of a few years ago.</p> <p>Freud readily acknowledges that we have reached a state of celebrity overload. 'Oh, we're so far past it. We're so overloaded, I think the definition of celebrity has changed. I think the media cycle is such that now, with very few exceptions, the famous are no longer interesting.' Which, of course, is one explanation of why attention has been redirected towards those, like Freud, who are behind the curtain, pulling the levers. Morgan suspects that the Planet Hollywood model may be indicative of the effect of Freud's kind of branding. He mentions the Pepsi relaunch a few years back to announce the new blue livery of the drink's can, which Freud took care of. There were acres of media coverage but the sales were not deemed a success.</p> <p>'It would be interesting to analyse exactly how well the companies have performed that Freuds have worked for,' says Morgan. Freud's own calculation is that 90 per cent of newspaper coverage has no effect. But he thinks that we 'still read editorial as truth, or at least as partial truth'. At the same time, he agrees that the public's credulity is stretched by the tactics that people like himself have employed to boost their clients. Witness the recent Evans and Halliwell saga. So media-wise is the public nowadays that hardly anyone was prepared to believe that the union was anything but a marketing exercise. And yet, curiously, Halliwell still made it to number one in the charts.</p> <p>A story ran in the Guardian 's diary, on the daythat I met Freud, suggesting that an unfavourable profile of him was pulled from the Spectator when pressure was placed on the writer by her employers at the Daily Mail. The Mail 's showbusiness editor was apparently afraid of offending Freud.</p> <p>The extension of the Freud myth is that he wields enormous sway in Fleet Street because he controls access to famous people. I'd heard that he was tipped off about the slant of the piece when a friend of his overheard the writer being briefed by one of Freud's enemies. When I asked him if he had anything to do with the story's demise, he denied it and laughed unconvincingly.</p> <p>'His face tells everything,' said one media consultant. 'You can see when he's anxious.' A facial tell could be seen as an occupational weakness for a PR, but Freud does most of his work on the phone, and much of the day-to-day graft is now performed by underlings. In this case, however, he seems to have falsely given himself away. Both the writer and the showbusiness editor separately confirmed that the Daily Mail simply didn't like the idea of one of their writers working for the Spectator. The rest is spin, although this time, not Freud's.</p> <p>The uncertainty that Freud provokes is perhaps not unrelated to the fact that his great-grandfather was the founder of psychoanalysis. Poised as it is between 'fraud' and 'pseud', the name Freud has enough doubtful connotations without the added weight of its history. But the familial shift through four generations from psychiatric doctor to spin doctor is too tempting to ignore.</p> <p>Just as Sigmund was concerned with the recesses of the mind, so Matthew operates in the background of the media. Psychoanalysis has long been viewed as a questionable 'science' and, similarly, public relations is dogged by the perception that it is an unnecessary invention. It might be said, in addition, that both Freuds know a thing or two about superegos.</p> <p>The great-grandson tells a story about being introduced to well-known New York publicist Bobby Zarem. 'Are you any relation?' Zarem asked. When Freud acknowledged that he was, Zarem was immediately keen to meet up. 'My shrink's out of town,' he said. 'I need to see you at once.'</p> <p>As it turned out, Zarem introduced Freud to Robert Earl, the proprietor of the Hard Rock Caf\u00e9, with whom he would later collaborate on Planet Hollywood. But his illustrious name, while obviously bearing advantages, is something which Freud says he has not always appreciated. 'My motivation for the first five years of my career was about trying to have a Christian name as well as a surname. My Christian name was really an irrelevance. I was somebody's great-grandson or somebody's son.'</p> <p>That said, he was a smart enough publicist not to call his company Matthew Communications. In fact, he first called it Matthew Freud and Associates, although the associates amounted to his sister, Emma, later to find fame as a radio and TV presenter, and his cat. In the early days, he says, the company was close to folding every week.</p> <p>Morgan recalls that the 'bullshit quotient was much higher' at that time. 'I wouldn't say that he would have sold his grandmother, but other relatives weren't safe.'</p> <p>According to Freud's sister, this is only a slight exaggeration. His first adult venture into business was a singing telegram service he set up as an 18-year-old, in which he employed a girlfriend and Emma to go out and perform.

Subsequently, the rumour has spread that Freud helped Mandelson gain his cabinet job. According to one sceptical Labour insider, the so-called campaign could be traced back to one article in the Sun entitled 'Peter's Friends', which had Mandelson down as an intimate of various celebrities including some, like Tom Cruise, whom he had never met. 'Freud placed that story,' says the Labour man. 'His understanding of politics is not that deep and mature.'</p> <p>Another story doing the rounds in London is that Freud approached the Labour Party and asked what exactly would be required for him to be awarded a peerage. When I asked Freud if this was true, he gave an answer that, while a denial, was frank and revealing. 'I work for the Labour Party, I work for the Dome and charities. At some point, you do get recognition. Funnily enough, though, I would not want a peerage as it currently exists. Perhaps when I'm 60, but not now. But if people are going to be appointed to the new upper house on merit, that's something I'd quite like to be considered for. I'm very interested in politics, but I don't think I want to be a Member of Parliament.'</p> <p>The Dome may prove to be the turning point that Freud has been preparing for. His friend Waheed Alli told me that he thought the scale of the PR industry was not 'quite big enough to contain Matthew's abilities'. According to Freud, he landed his unpaid role on the executive board of the Dome when he told Mandelson that he was 'mad' to have appointed Saatchi's advertising agency. Mandelson replied: 'Ooh, I need your brain.'</p> <p>Freud feels that he has had most impact in ensuring that the Dome is more populist. He was behind the Blackadder contribution. 'When I arrived, I looked at the plans, which were all very serious and a little dull, and said: \"If you subscribe to Blueprint magazine [a rather austere design publication], this is the greatest day out in your life.\"'</p> <p>Sam Chisholm, the tough-talking former head of Sky, is uncharacteristically fulsome in his praise. 'Matthew has a very analytical mind. He always seems to know exactly where everyone's trying to get to. He knows the end game, although attention to detail may not be his strong point. But he is always willing and able to make decisions and come up with solutions. He has an outstanding mind. I think people will see what an extraordinary contribution he's made to the Dome.'</p> <p>It's a surprising testimony, not least because it is received wisdom inside the TV industry that the reason Chisholm fell out with Rupert Murdoch was due to the former's inability to get along with the latter's daughter, Elisabeth, the new partner of Freud. The romance between Freud and Murdoch has already been the subject of intense speculation. Tatler devoted six pages to the Notting Hill soap opera that has developed since the break-up of Freud's marriage to Caroline 'Pidge' Hutton, the mother of his two young sons. She is now involved with Earl Spencer, and is living in the house Freud bought from his brother-in-law, Curtis, the house that featured in the film Notting Hill.</p> <p>Freud says that he hasn't relished the attention, although he is philosophical about its purpose. 'What I always say to my clients is: you have to externalise it. It's like shares on a stock market that go up and down without you doing anything.'</p> <p>He has plenty of opportunity to learn from close quarters about the invasiveness of press scrutiny. It was he who had to break the news to Bob Geldof that his wife, Paula Yates, was having an affair with Michael Hutchence and that the News of the World was about to publish the details. The experience, which he describes as 'tragic', did not undermine his respect for the British tabloid press. 'The News of the World had done a fantastic job,' he says. 'They'd got a fantastic piece of tabloid content.'</p> <p>What will probably protect Freud from too much unwanted attention is the fact that his girlfriend's father owns half the press and the other half will follow the unwritten law that you don't mess with the family of media barons. Elisabeth doesn't see it that way. She feels that Freud has had to endure a rough ride. 'Sometimes,' she says, 'it reminds me of how my dad has been treated by the media.' She is fiercely proud of Freud, whom she describes as 'fantastically talented'. They met in early 1997, when she was eight-and-a-half months pregnant with her second child from a marriage that is now ended. She was instantly impressed. 'I offered him a job right away.'</p> <p>Their relationship was an open rumour for some time before they 'came out' at a Royal Shakespeare Company costume ball (theme: Les Liaisons Dangereuses ) in late 1998. The couple were photographed in 18th-century finery. Most observers thought it was inspired PR, but Murdoch claims it was not a conscious decision. 'Oh, that party,' she says, embarrassed. 'Those photographs were not intentional. We broke up the next day.'</p> <p>Friends agree that the relationship is now on much firmer territory, although they raise doubts over what Elisabeth's father thinks. There have been rumours that Murdoch is not best pleased with his prospective son-in-law? 'I think there are people who are threatened,' says one friend. 'I wouldn't know if Murdoch is behind the stories, but he has always been nice to Matthew in person.'</p> <p>What, I asked Chisholm, does he think Murdoch would think of his prospective son-in-law. He thought for a while, as if pondering each word in print. 'I think,' he said finally, 'he'd find him a fascinating young man.'</p> <p>The launch of Sky Digital in 1998 provided a tense and public forum for the two men to meet. Freud was in charge of the party, held in Battersea power station. The evening was dogged by technical difficulties, leading to a breakdown in sound. Freud was reported to have metamorphosed into 'a headless chicken'. Morgan recalls the occasion with barely hidden glee. 'My lasting memory is of Matthew drunk in the corner, alone, looking like he wanted to kill himself.'</p> <p>'It definitely was not a high point,' says Freud. 'When you do something in the name of Murdoch and the function of it is to launch something to the media, there is no margin for error. When we do a premiere for Disney and they tell you Eisner's coming, you go back and relook at all the arrangements. Clearly, in the Murdoch instance there was a double factor.'</p> <p>He shut down the events department afterwards. 'Jeopardising a \u00a31 million-fee income account because a hairy-arsed roadie put a plug in the wrong place on an event on which you might make \u00a320,000 is not smart any more.'</p> <p>At the end of 1998, Freud pulled out of working for Sky and News International because of his entanglement with Elisabeth. 'It certainly became difficult when he and I started a relationship,' she concedes. 'But his company still does project work for us.'</p> <p>Rebekah Wade, who is a friend of the couple, says that Freud has changed a lot in the past year. 'He's happier now than I've ever seen him. Much more open and relaxed.'</p> <p>This news will come as a relief to those in the business who have been used to seeing a rather forlorn-looking character, standing in the shadows, worrying over his clients. As one media consultant said: 'I wish he was more likable. I can't see why he shouldn't be. He should be happy all day long.'</p> <p>Freud is, as his great-grandfather might have said, a complex character. He is reserved and private by nature, yet he works in a hectic, public environment. He is by turns loudly self-deprecating and quietly boastful, a man with a sharp mind put to blunt use. You sense that he's not unaware of the conflict. In the Nineties, to use one of his own phrases, he helped shape the zeitgeist. At the start of this decade, the new millennium, he has already stamped his mark on its most visible symbol, the Dome. He has played the media game with consummate skill but, if he genuinely wants to make a name for himself, perhaps now is the time to put away childish things.</p>",

      "bodyText": "We meet the morning after the Bridget Jones party in the central London offices of Freud Communications, the PR company he set up in 1985. Freud is dressed in a black jumper, black casual trousers and black boots. One TV presenter had described him to me as 'the most exhausted-looking person in public life'. Yet he looks in better shape than the previous night, more relaxed, fresher faced, younger, even. He talks in the west London demotic common to thrusting media and music executives, a kind of downbeat earthiness interspersed with sales jargon. For instance, of his growing profile in the press, he says: 'I've had awareness before, but never anything approaching equity.' Another sign of his salesmanship is a conversational tic of asking rhetorical questions to which he then supplies pithy answers. 'Is there such a thing as bad publicity? Fuck, yes.' He is bright, rather than intellectual, and, deliberately or not, has successfully shed any vestiges of his public school education at St Anthony's prep school in Hampstead and Westminster. At 36, he is still youthful, at least in terms of the business world. He has talked about leaving public relations by the time he turns 40. 'Old PR men are deeply sad individuals. I don't think I would want to spend my life in a derivative business.' He has also made clear his reservations about the fame game, speaking of the 'primary narcissism of many celebrities'. Piers Morgan, for one, is highly doubtful that Freud's future lies elsewhere. 'He likes to think of himself as an internet entrepreneur but he's the Alastair Campbell of showbusiness: ruthless but sharp. I think he's a serial networker, a social butterfly who loves to be around celebrities.' Freud, it should be said, does not give the impression of someone who is starry-eyed. He's too clever for that. He talks about celebrity dispassionately, in terms of 'equity' and 'leverage'. His expertise lies in encouraging a brand to buy into the equity of a celebrity's fame, thus enabling Freud to leverage editorial exposure for both the brand and the celebrity. It's an arrangement that he first perfected, spectacularly, with the publicity surrounding the opening of Planet Hollywood in London in 1992. Before that launch, showbusiness was largely a contained enterprise. Afterwards, it leaked into everything - drenching the tabloids and diluting the broadsheet agenda, spreading like a stain across the TV schedules, T-shirts, baseball caps and hamburgers. The effect was that the public's appetite for celebrity stories grew swiftly more bulimic on a diet of manufactured publicity. Of course, Planet Hollywood was not the first showbusiness concern to shift merchandise, but it was the most self-conscious and deliberate and, arguably, the first to have no other purpose, artistic or otherwise, than to shift merchandise. In Freud's words: 'It was the ultimate transfer of celebrity equity into a T-shirt.' Morgan, who was then the Sun 's showbusiness reporter, can recall the seismic effect of the opening night. 'It was the biggest party London had seen for 20 years and Matthew handled it with aplomb. There was Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Eddie Murphy, Bruce Willis, Michael Douglas, to name but a few. That was the moment that people started to take Matthew seriously. We splashed on it in the Sun.' A couple of months ago, Planet Hollywood announced that it had gone bust. Freud laughs when I ask if he still represents the company. 'Er, yeah. I mean, that's a fantastic story. It's a parable of empty foundations. Celebrities were brought in to kick-start something that otherwise would have taken a long time. So you went from nothing to an overnight sensation by transplanting all these famous people on to a logo. Planet Hollywood went from nothing to a $3.5 billion operation to nothing again in a seven-year period. The fact is, the tabloids were completely conspiratorial in building the Planet Hollywood brand, because we gave them something they'd never had before, which was absolutely unfettered access to huge celebrities who would do almost anything to sell a burger and a T-shirt. It was remarkable to see these titans of the screen throwing out baseball caps to crowds and saying the apple strudel's really good.' In some ways, the rise and fall of Planet Hollywood traces the arc of our obsession with celebrity. It probably peaked mid-decade, but while it hasn't yet fizzled out, there are signs that interest is waning. First of all, the celebrities themselves are becoming smaller and more transient, as they vainly attempt to fill the space created by that initial Planet Hollywood blitzkrieg, and secondly, the tabloids are beginning to step back from the frenzied overexposure of a few years ago. Freud readily acknowledges that we have reached a state of celebrity overload. 'Oh, we're so far past it. We're so overloaded, I think the definition of celebrity has changed. I think the media cycle is such that now, with very few exceptions, the famous are no longer interesting.' Which, of course, is one explanation of why attention has been redirected towards those, like Freud, who are behind the curtain, pulling the levers. Morgan suspects that the Planet Hollywood model may be indicative of the effect of Freud's kind of branding. He mentions the Pepsi relaunch a few years back to announce the new blue livery of the drink's can, which Freud took care of. There were acres of media coverage but the sales were not deemed a success. 'It would be interesting to analyse exactly how well the companies have performed that Freuds have worked for,' says Morgan. Freud's own calculation is that 90 per cent of newspaper coverage has no effect. But he thinks that we 'still read editorial as truth, or at least as partial truth'. At the same time, he agrees that the public's credulity is stretched by the tactics that people like himself have employed to boost their clients. Witness the recent Evans and Halliwell saga. So media-wise is the public nowadays that hardly anyone was prepared to believe that the union was anything but a marketing exercise. And yet, curiously, Halliwell still made it to number one in the charts. A story ran in the Guardian 's diary, on the daythat I met Freud, suggesting that an unfavourable profile of him was pulled from the Spectator when pressure was placed on the writer by her employers at the Daily Mail. The Mail 's showbusiness editor was apparently afraid of offending Freud. The extension of the Freud myth is that he wields enormous sway in Fleet Street because he controls access to famous people. I'd heard that he was tipped off about the slant of the piece when a friend of his overheard the writer being briefed by one of Freud's enemies. When I asked him if he had anything to do with the story's demise, he denied it and laughed unconvincingly. 'His face tells everything,' said one media consultant. 'You can see when he's anxious.' A facial tell could be seen as an occupational weakness for a PR, but Freud does most of his work on the phone, and much of the day-to-day graft is now performed by underlings. In this case, however, he seems to have falsely given himself away. Both the writer and the showbusiness editor separately confirmed that the Daily Mail simply didn't like the idea of one of their writers working for the Spectator. The rest is spin, although this time, not Freud's. The uncertainty that Freud provokes is perhaps not unrelated to the fact that his great-grandfather was the founder of psychoanalysis. Poised as it is between 'fraud' and 'pseud', the name Freud has enough doubtful connotations without the added weight of its history. But the familial shift through four generations from psychiatric doctor to spin doctor is too tempting to ignore. Just as Sigmund was concerned with the recesses of the mind, so Matthew operates in the background of the media. Psychoanalysis has long been viewed as a questionable 'science' and, similarly, public relations is dogged by the perception that it is an unnecessary invention. It might be said, in addition, that both Freuds know a thing or two about superegos. The great-grandson tells a story about being introduced to well-known New York publicist Bobby Zarem. 'Are you any relation?' Zarem asked. When Freud acknowledged that he was, Zarem was immediately keen to meet up. 'My shrink's out of town,' he said. 'I need to see you at once.' As it turned out, Zarem introduced Freud to Robert Earl, the proprietor of the Hard Rock Caf\u00e9, with whom he would later collaborate on Planet Hollywood. But his illustrious name, while obviously bearing advantages, is something which Freud says he has not always appreciated. 'My motivation for the first five years of my career was about trying to have a Christian name as well as a surname. My Christian name was really an irrelevance. I was somebody's great-grandson or somebody's son.' That said, he was a smart enough publicist not to call his company Matthew Communications. In fact, he first called it Matthew Freud and Associates, although the associates amounted to his sister, Emma, later to find fame as a radio and TV presenter, and his cat. In the early days, he says, the company was close to folding every week. Morgan recalls that the 'bullshit quotient was much higher' at that time. 'I wouldn't say that he would have sold his grandmother, but other relatives weren't safe.' According to Freud's sister, this is only a slight exaggeration. His first adult venture into business was a singing telegram service he set up as an 18-year-old, in which he employed a girlfriend and Emma to go out and perform. 'It lasted about six months,' she remembers. 'It was a disaster. I went round to offices singing in a horrible outfit, while he sat in the office and took a couple of calls a day.' The selling instinct was first glimpsed when he was a child on family holidays. His sister relates how he sold pet mice to other children, only to demand double the price to take them back from appalled parents. He then graduated from livestock to hot dogs - Emma insists there was a healthy gap between the two. As a pupil, Freud was bright but uncommitted. He left Westminster public school, where he was remembered for playing the drums and being 'cool', when he was 16, and then dropped out of Pimlico comprehensive the following year. A little while after, he was charged and fined for possession of cannabis and cocaine. 'At 18,' says Emma Freud, 'you would have had very little hope for him. He was great fun, but quite wild. In his teens, he thought that if he could be in the right place at the right time, everything would fine. In his twenties, Matt learnt the connection between hard work and success.' After a stint working for RCA as a publicist for David Bowie and the Eurythmics, he was introduced to Uri Geller by his father, Clement Freud. Geller says he was looking for someone to help in negotiating a deal with a gold-mining company. 'I thought that I would give Matthew a break.' Apparently the deal went well, and Freud showed himself to be, in Geller's words, 'very cool and precise'. The man who had become famous by stopping watches gave the enterprising young man the benefit of his experience. 'I told him,' says Geller, 'that successful men wear a Rolex.' He worked tremendously hard through the remainder of the Eighties, networking furiously, without great rewards. One former girlfriend claimed that he could speak to three people on the phone, in three different accents, with three different spins, switching between them on hold, 'while simultaneously having sex with me'. It was not until 1992, however, that his company, renamed Freud Communications, started to earn Rolex money. Even so, Freud had already assumed the stature of a man who was going places. Kris Thykier, who is Freud's trusty lieutenant, recalls arriving for a job interview when the company occupied cramped mews offices housing around 12 staff. 'I remember that downstairs was a hive of activity, with all these people squeezed into a small space. Upstairs, Matthew had the entire floor to himself, with this large desk and incredibly large chair.' He employed Thykier, then just 18, to take care of a television account for a production company called Planet 24, which was producing a new morning programme called The Big Breakfast. An often-cited criticism of Freud is that he runs a neo-Dickensian sweatshop, in which young workers are hired on low wages and then overworked until they burn out. Both Freud and Thykier argue that the company has provided opportunities for young people that they would not gain at more conventional agencies, and that staff often move on to thrive elsewhere. Waheed Alli, who was made a peer by the Labour government, was one of the partners behind Planet 24. He can remember his first meeting with Freud. 'I instantly disliked him,' he says. 'I think I mistook shyness for coldness. He is shy, but I soon realised that when you're in a meeting with him, there's no stopping, no nerves, just pure genius. The thing that people underestimate about Matthew is that he's a brilliant strategist.' Freud's strategy for The Big Breakfast was to sell it as a recognisable brand.

'We didn't make that - he did. But if you drew a graph of Chris Evans copy over the past seven years, it is massively weighted towards the launch of each of the significant steps in his career. We don't get enough credit for being able to leverage media interest to commercial gain.' Evans stands at the centre of what has been described as the immensely profitable 'synergy' of Freud's clients. For example, Evans, a Freud client, might have used The Big Breakfast, a Freud client, to interview a Hollywood star Freud was representing about, say, Planet Hollywood, a Freud client. The success of Four Weddings and a Funeral, which Freud publicised (his sister is married to Richard Curtis, the film's creator), completed the annus mirabilis of 1992.

Mandelson replied: 'Ooh, I need your brain.' Freud feels that he has had most impact in ensuring that the Dome is more populist. He was behind the Blackadder contribution. 'When I arrived, I looked at the plans, which were all very serious and a little dull, and said: \"If you subscribe to Blueprint magazine [a rather austere design publication], this is the greatest day out in your life.\"' Sam Chisholm, the tough-talking former head of Sky, is uncharacteristically fulsome in his praise. 'Matthew has a very analytical mind. He always seems to know exactly where everyone's trying to get to. He knows the end game, although attention to detail may not be his strong point. But he is always willing and able to make decisions and come up with solutions. He has an outstanding mind. I think people will see what an extraordinary contribution he's made to the Dome.' It's a surprising testimony, not least because it is received wisdom inside the TV industry that the reason Chisholm fell out with Rupert Murdoch was due to the former's inability to get along with the latter's daughter, Elisabeth, the new partner of Freud. The romance between Freud and Murdoch has already been the subject of intense speculation. Tatler devoted six pages to the Notting Hill soap opera that has developed since the break-up of Freud's marriage to Caroline 'Pidge' Hutton, the mother of his two young sons. She is now involved with Earl Spencer, and is living in the house Freud bought from his brother-in-law, Curtis, the house that featured in the film Notting Hill. Freud says that he hasn't relished the attention, although he is philosophical about its purpose. 'What I always say to my clients is: you have to externalise it. It's like shares on a stock market that go up and down without you doing anything.' He has plenty of opportunity to learn from close quarters about the invasiveness of press scrutiny. It was he who had to break the news to Bob Geldof that his wife, Paula Yates, was having an affair with Michael Hutchence and that the News of the World was about to publish the details. The experience, which he describes as 'tragic', did not undermine his respect for the British tabloid press. 'The News of the World had done a fantastic job,' he says. 'They'd got a fantastic piece of tabloid content.' What will probably protect Freud from too much unwanted attention is the fact that his girlfriend's father owns half the press and the other half will follow the unwritten law that you don't mess with the family of media barons. Elisabeth doesn't see it that way. She feels that Freud has had to endure a rough ride. 'Sometimes,' she says, 'it reminds me of how my dad has been treated by the media.' She is fiercely proud of Freud, whom she describes as 'fantastically talented'. They met in early 1997, when she was eight-and-a-half months pregnant with her second child from a marriage that is now ended. She was instantly impressed. 'I offered him a job right away.' Their relationship was an open rumour for some time before they 'came out' at a Royal Shakespeare Company costume ball (theme: Les Liaisons Dangereuses ) in late 1998. The couple were photographed in 18th-century finery. Most observers thought it was inspired PR, but Murdoch claims it was not a conscious decision. 'Oh, that party,' she says, embarrassed. 'Those photographs were not intentional. We broke up the next day.' Friends agree that the relationship is now on much firmer territory, although they raise doubts over what Elisabeth's father thinks. There have been rumours that Murdoch is not best pleased with his prospective son-in-law? 'I think there are people who are threatened,' says one friend. 'I wouldn't know if Murdoch is behind the stories, but he has always been nice to Matthew in person.' What, I asked Chisholm, does he think Murdoch would think of his prospective son-in-law. He thought for a while, as if pondering each word in print. 'I think,' he said finally, 'he'd find him a fascinating young man.' The launch of Sky Digital in 1998 provided a tense and public forum for the two men to meet. Freud was in charge of the party, held in Battersea power station. The evening was dogged by technical difficulties, leading to a breakdown in sound. Freud was reported to have metamorphosed into 'a headless chicken'. Morgan recalls the occasion with barely hidden glee. 'My lasting memory is of Matthew drunk in the corner, alone, looking like he wanted to kill himself.' 'It definitely was not a high point,' says Freud. 'When you do something in the name of Murdoch and the function of it is to launch something to the media, there is no margin for error. When we do a premiere for Disney and they tell you Eisner's coming, you go back and relook at all the arrangements. Clearly, in the Murdoch instance there was a double factor.' He shut down the events department afterwards. 'Jeopardising a \u00a31 million-fee income account because a hairy-arsed roadie put a plug in the wrong place on an event on which you might make \u00a320,000 is not smart any more.' At the end of 1998, Freud pulled out of working for Sky and News International because of his entanglement with Elisabeth. 'It certainly became difficult when he and I started a relationship,' she concedes. 'But his company still does project work for us.' Rebekah Wade, who is a friend of the couple, says that Freud has changed a lot in the past year. 'He's happier now than I've ever seen him. Much more open and relaxed.' This news will come as a relief to those in the business who have been used to seeing a rather forlorn-looking character, standing in the shadows, worrying over his clients. As one media consultant said: 'I wish he was more likable. I can't see why he shouldn't be. He should be happy all day long.' Freud is, as his great-grandfather might have said, a complex character. He is reserved and private by nature, yet he works in a hectic, public environment. He is by turns loudly self-deprecating and quietly boastful, a man with a sharp mind put to blunt use. You sense that he's not unaware of the conflict. In the Nineties, to use one of his own phrases, he helped shape the zeitgeist. At the start of this decade, the new millennium, he has already stamped his mark on its most visible symbol, the Dome. He has played the media game with consummate skill but, if he genuinely wants to make a name for himself, perhaps now is the time to put away childish things.",

      "body": "<b>THE BURNER</b> <p>This is the plan to drop body fat and sculpt six packs. The man in charge is personal trainer Matt Roberts. 'It combines fat-burning aerobic work and muscle-building strength training,' says Matt. Many people on a fat-loss programme don't think that increasing muscle mass counts, so they concentrate on aerobic work, but as Matt explains, muscle building is equally important. 'Muscle burns calories even when you're sitting still.' Strength training also has health benefits, including reducing risk of osteoporosis and heart disease. </p> <p><b>The four-week programme</b></p> <p> Aim for at least three one-hour sessions a week, with 30 minutes of cardiovascular work and 25-30 minutes of resistance work and stretching. </p> <p><b>Week one</b></p> <p> Matt believes the most fundamental part of a burner programme is to work out the correct intensity for Martin to exercise. </p> <p>'Aim to get your heart rate up to 70-80 per cent of its maximum during CV work,' says Matt. 'You can calculate this by taking your age away from 220 - so if you're 40, you get 180. Then find 70-80 per cent of that figure - in this case it would be 126-144. Take your pulse for 10 seconds. Count the beats for those 10 seconds and multiply by six. That figure should fall somewhere between the 70-80 per cent figure. In terms of weights, aim at a weight that lets you do two sets of 15-18 reps.' </p> <p><b> Martin's diary:</b> 'At my assessment my trainer, Simon, shows some surprise at how little I weigh. \"That's not bad,\" he says, \"you're just a funny shape.\" He means I have a belly from hell ... it has to go. I am quietly but firmly told to replace my morning bacon sandwich with an apple or banana and to drink a bottle of mineral water a day.'</p> <p><b>Week two</b></p> <p> Because he's working at a high intensity, Matt won't alter Martin's programme for the first three weeks. 'We're working on technique and breathing to make every move smooth and easy,' he explains. Physiologically, Martin's body is changing. 'He's growing more muscle fibres, making exercise easier and improving energy,' says Matt. </p> <p><b>Martin's diary:</b> 'I have three hourly sessions a week: half an hour of cardiovascular work (running, cycling, rowing machines) and half an hour of weights and floor exercises - I am phenomenally unsupple. I'm told that the mistake most people make is to expect to lose weight immediately. But most fat is converted to muscle. I repeat this as a mantra.' </p> <p> <b>Week three</b></p> <p> The weight loss is starting to kick in. 'Martin has lost about three pounds,' says Matt - what he'd expect from most clients. </p> <p><b>Martin's diary:</b> 'It is clear by now just how unfit I am. There are no real visible results, but the combination of enforced exercise and a better diet is having a definite psychological effect. I feel more alert and find it marginally easier to get up in the morning. My stamina is slowly building.'</p> <p><b>Week four </b></p> <p>Things start speeding up now. 'Martin has reached a reasonable level of fitness, so it's time to crank things up a bit,' says Matt. 'We start bringing in interval training which takes his heartbeat up to 80-85% of its maximum and we start intensively weight training individual muscles - for example, doing three chest-toning exercises in one go.' This is when the results really start to happen. </p> <p><b> Martin's diary: </b> 'The remnants of flu mean a day's training is out. But a session of reflexology apparently reveals that I am still a physical wreck and not drinking enough water. The final two sessions of the week are tough, as Simon builds up the pressure. I hate the rowing machine, the best all-round exercise according to the experts, but torture for me. My breathing is more relaxed and I can feel my posture improving. I'm still a funny shape, but now I know what to do about it.'</p> <p><b>THE TEAMSTER </b></p> <p>This plan combines your own personal selection of daily activities like walking and cycling, and thrice-weekly exercise classes and team-based sports. Elesa Argent, from Holmes Place, Barbican, who helped us devise the programme, says, 'You can increase your health dramatically simply by doing 30 minutes' activity a day.' </p> <p>In the teamster plan, you're aiming for a variety of different activities not only to keep your interest but also to ensure maximum fitness benefits. 'If you do the same workout too often, your fitness stops improving,' says Elesa. This is particularly prevalent in sports-based plans where you can't easily work faster or harder each session. By swapping exercises, you stop your body getting bored and prevent this. </p> <p><b>The four-week programme</b></p> <p> Variety is the key here. As well as 30 minutes' activity a day (in short bursts or one long session), Elesa recommends three sessions a week of team sports and exercise classes.</p> <p><b>Week one</b></p> <p> The most important thing when you start a programme to improve your fitness is to start slowly. Unlike gym-based programmes where you control the intensity of what you do, class- and team-based programmes mean you can get influenced by the fitness levels of others and, if they're more advanced than you, you could end up with injuries.</p> <p> For week one, Elesa recommends that Vanessa concentrate on the activity-based part of the programme. 'She should be aiming to walk or cycle for half an hour a day - and during each session, she should aim to work harder.' </p> <p><b>Vanessa's diary: </b> 'This week seems to be about simply trying to motivate myself. I am concentrating on how it would feel to be fit, but my energy is so low and it is so cold. Elesa tells me that after a couple of sessions it will seem a lot easier.'</p> <p><b> Week two</b> </p> <p> This is the week to add your first exercise class or sport session to those 30-minute activity sessions. Elesa recommends a low-impact, low-coordination class for Vanessa. 'There's no point going to a complex class yet; you'll just get disheartened if you can't keep up or don't know the moves.' </p> <p><b>Vanessa's diary:</b> 'She was right. Once you start to move your body about again, things do get better. Although I am still getting puffed very quickly, even from just walking a bit more, I find that my back aches less after a day at the computer and I am sleeping better. Also, happily, the desire to eat bad food diminishes as you start to treat yourself better. This was something I remember from fitter days.'</p> <p> <b> Week three </b> </p> <p> Now that you're feeling stronger, it's time to start your first sport. 'Which you choose depends on personal preference,' says Elesa, 'but Vanessa's choice of squash is a good one for beginners, as it's something in which she can control the intensity herself.' </p> <p> <b>Vanessa's diary:</b> 'This is pure frustration. I am not noticing much of a change in my body shape or energy levels, and so it is hard not to fall into skipping planned visits to the gym. The time needed to arrange a regular squash partner is proving impossible on top of work and doing all the household stuff. I am drinking and eating less (but that might be because I'm getting flu).'</p> <p><b>Week four </b></p> <p>You can switch up to a more advanced exercise class or sport. As Vanessa is proving, not only will your fitness levels have improved, so will your motor skills, making trickier classes easier. You'll also find you're better at sports that need quick reaction times like squash or tennis. </p> <p><b>Vanessa's diary:</b> 'I am trying to start going to aerobics classes again. This, along with swimming, looks increasingly like the right way for me to get healthy because it is so hard to set up regular sessions for squash. Flu has knocked me out, so I feel a bit like I am starting from scratch. But I have more determination. I actually want to keep this going.' </p> <p><b> THE TONER</b></p> <p>This plan defines your muscles to create a lean, sculpted look which, in turn, improves strength and flexibility. Pilates uses a series of detailed movements that work the muscles deep inside the body. </p> <p>'Over the years factors like poor posture or injuries alter these muscles. Some shorten and tighten, others become loose and less elastic, and both combined lead to a body that's out of balance,' says Pilates teacher Lynne Robinson. 'This leads to an un-toned figure, poor posture, problems like back pain and even dull skin as the taut muscles trap toxins. Pilates corrects these and reminds your body how to move naturally.' Many of the movements are very small but it takes intense concentration and focus, and it gets results. </p> <p><b>The four-week programme</b> </p> <p> Lynne recommends that Tracy see her three times a week to start with. By week four, she can reduce this to once or twice, working on her own at home for at least another hour.</p> <p><b>Week one</b> </p> <p> The first part of any Pilates programme is a postural assessment that looks for any muscle imbalances, postural problems and/or faulty movement patterns. A personal programme is then devised to correct these and, by the end of the first week, 'Tracy should be more aware of how she stands/sits, etc and recognise problems that need correcting,' says Lynne. </p> <p><b> Tracy's diary:</b> 'I've never been scrutinised so closely. Apparently, my centre of gravity is wrong, leading to problems with my back and knees. My first few sessions are spent doing some gentle moves to loosen and tone these areas.'</p> <p><b>Week two </b></p> <p> 'Now that Tracy is aware of how to move correctly, we can start exercises that promote flexibility and strength in the spine. This helps create the \"girdle of strength\" - a set of strong muscles in the midsection of the body that support every part of it,' says Lynne.<br> </p> <p><br><b>Tracy's diary:</b> 'Things are getting tougher. A lot of the work focuses on my back and abdominal muscles, and I haven't really used these before. The moves are subtle, but you really feel the muscles under your skin. I've been adjusting how I sit and stand outside sessions, trying to get my body into its \"natural\" position - which feels wrong, as I've been standing incorrectly for so long.'</p> <p><b>Week three </b> </p> <p>As Tracy progresses, she can now use the Pilates machines - particularly the one called the Reformer. 'This really tones the buttocks, arms and legs,' says Lynne. 'Tracy's feeling muscles she never knew existed.' </p> <p><b>Tracy's diary: </b>'Apparently, I'm doing really well. Lynne is already noticing stronger stomach and back muscles and an improvement in my body positioning. My reward is to get on the machines dotted around the studio. I loathe the Reformer. I have to lie legs splayed and lift weights with my thighs - I thought Pilates was supposed to be dignified and gentle.'</p> <p><b>Week four </b></p> <p>Exercises with weights and more complicated exercise sequences are added to Tracy's programme. 'It'll still be many months before she masters all Pilates has to offer. But everyone will already be noticing that she stands taller and looks leaner - yet she won't really have lost weight,' says Lynne, adding that Tracy will also feel stronger and more energised. </p> <p> <b>Tracy's diary: </b> 'I'm lifting free weights. The variety of exercises is really surprising and has stopped me getting bored. While I haven't yet noticed a dramatic change in my shape, I'm feeling looser, my stomach and back feel firmer and I'm standing better. People in the studio all have great bodies, which is really motivating.' </p> <p><b>THE SPIRITUALIST</b></p> <p>The spiritualist programme uses exercise to calm the mind and body. What matters is the sense of relaxation you achieve and the physical benefits that come with this. 'Yoga combines held postures with breath work,' says our teacher Anton Michael Rocke. 'The aim is to help you relax mentally through the use of these held postures, tapping into the fact that each has its own physical, mental and energy benefits.'</p> <p><b>The four-week programme</b></p> <p> Anton recommends that Richard attend classes three times a week. 'The best class contains a mix of postures, breathing exercises and guided imagery for deep relaxation.'</p> <p><b>Week one </b></p> <p> Anton says the thing Richard finds hardest is low flexibility, which could make many of the postures seem impossible. However, over the next few sessions, the muscle fibres will lengthen. 'He'll first notice this in the area around the lower back, making positions like this Sitting Forward Bend much easier. Mentally, he'll find his thoughts are less scattered.' <br></p> <p><b>Richard's diary:</b> 'The session has more spirituality, and less stretching, than I expected. There's lots of relaxation and breathing exercises. I can't stretch any distance at all. But I feel good afterwards.'</p> <p><b>Week two </b></p> <p> 'The muscle fibres are lengthening and Richard will notice he has an increased range of movement. He's also getting more accustomed to using his body strength and so even more positions will be within his grasp.' </p> <p><b>Richard's diary:</b> 'To my amazement, I am able to move my muscles a little bit more than before. Part of it is in the concentration, I think. Anton has to push and pull quite a bit because my back is hopeless. I am struggling with long stretches, but I am definitely more relaxed.'</p> <p><b>Week three</b></p> <p> Richard's breathing is getting noticeably deeper. The postures he's practised over the last few weeks have encouraged slower, deeper breathing. 'This will be helping to calm him in day-to-day life,' says Anton. </p> <p><b>Richard's diary:</b> 'I've got the breathing thing going much better, which has reduced my anxiety levels. I'm feeling better about my body (an achievement when I look at Anton's!) and am able to do more of the moves.'</p> <p><b>Week four </b></p> <p>Richard's flexibility is improving quite dramatically, particularly in his legs. 'Because we are so sedentary, the muscles in this area are very tight,' says Anton. 'For many people, this point brings relief from a lot of backaches. Richard should now be better at meditating on his own and finding it easy to switch off from day-to-day pressures.' </p> <p> <b>Richard's diary: </b> 'I can put my fingers around my feet! My back feels stronger, and the exercises have improved my posture. I am breathing better, and am more relaxed.'</p> <p> <b>Getting started - the rules for success </b> </p> <p>\u0095 Check you're up to it. You should always get a health check before you start an exercise programme. Most gyms will do a blood pressure check and ask you about any injuries, but if you're working on your own, you should get a general OK from your GP. This is particularly true if you have any heart or blood pressure problems and back or joint injuries.</p> <p>\u0095 Know your baselines. Taking some simple measurements like resting heart rate, blood pressure, body fat or weight and flexibility before you start will allow you to see how you're progressing. You'll be amazed at how quickly things can change and knowing exact figures can be hugely motivating. </p> <p>\u0095 Get yourself in the right mindset. 'The people who succeed on an exercise programme are those who know why they are doing it. They go into it thinking that they are going to succeed and, more importantly, that they want to do it,' says Professor Stuart Biddle. 'Think of all the things you can gain from exercise and how they're going to benefit your life.' </p> <p>\u0095 Even if the plan fails, stick at it. 'Many novice exercisers think they'll achieve far more than they will and get disheartened when it doesn't happen,' says Professor Biddle. 'Set yourself mini-plans and goals.'

      "bodyText": "THE BURNER This is the plan to drop body fat and sculpt six packs. The man in charge is personal trainer Matt Roberts. 'It combines fat-burning aerobic work and muscle-building strength training,' says Matt. Many people on a fat-loss programme don't think that increasing muscle mass counts, so they concentrate on aerobic work, but as Matt explains, muscle building is equally important. 'Muscle burns calories even when you're sitting still.' Strength training also has health benefits, including reducing risk of osteoporosis and heart disease. The four-week programme Aim for at least three one-hour sessions a week, with 30 minutes of cardiovascular work and 25-30 minutes of resistance work and stretching. Week one Matt believes the most fundamental part of a burner programme is to work out the correct intensity for Martin to exercise. 'Aim to get your heart rate up to 70-80 per cent of its maximum during CV work,' says Matt. 'You can calculate this by taking your age away from 220 - so if you're 40, you get 180. Then find 70-80 per cent of that figure - in this case it would be 126-144. Take your pulse for 10 seconds. Count the beats for those 10 seconds and multiply by six. That figure should fall somewhere between the 70-80 per cent figure. In terms of weights, aim at a weight that lets you do two sets of 15-18 reps.' Martin's diary: 'At my assessment my trainer, Simon, shows some surprise at how little I weigh. \"That's not bad,\" he says, \"you're just a funny shape.\" He means I have a belly from hell ... it has to go. I am quietly but firmly told to replace my morning bacon sandwich with an apple or banana and to drink a bottle of mineral water a day.' Week two Because he's working at a high intensity, Matt won't alter Martin's programme for the first three weeks. 'We're working on technique and breathing to make every move smooth and easy,' he explains. Physiologically, Martin's body is changing. 'He's growing more muscle fibres, making exercise easier and improving energy,' says Matt. Martin's diary: 'I have three hourly sessions a week: half an hour of cardiovascular work (running, cycling, rowing machines) and half an hour of weights and floor exercises - I am phenomenally unsupple. I'm told that the mistake most people make is to expect to lose weight immediately. But most fat is converted to muscle. I repeat this as a mantra.' Week three The weight loss is starting to kick in. 'Martin has lost about three pounds,' says Matt - what he'd expect from most clients. Martin's diary: 'It is clear by now just how unfit I am. There are no real visible results, but the combination of enforced exercise and a better diet is having a definite psychological effect. I feel more alert and find it marginally easier to get up in the morning. My stamina is slowly building.' Week four Things start speeding up now. 'Martin has reached a reasonable level of fitness, so it's time to crank things up a bit,' says Matt. 'We start bringing in interval training which takes his heartbeat up to 80-85% of its maximum and we start intensively weight training individual muscles - for example, doing three chest-toning exercises in one go.' This is when the results really start to happen. Martin's diary: 'The remnants of flu mean a day's training is out. But a session of reflexology apparently reveals that I am still a physical wreck and not drinking enough water. The final two sessions of the week are tough, as Simon builds up the pressure. I hate the rowing machine, the best all-round exercise according to the experts, but torture for me. My breathing is more relaxed and I can feel my posture improving. I'm still a funny shape, but now I know what to do about it.'

      "body": "<p>The government deplores the forces of conservatism. It detests Old Labour. And now Home Secretary Jack Straw is a ferocious critic of 'woolly-minded' liberals. The only constituency and philosophy that draws its uncritical admiration is business. It was the fact that businesses in Manchester might make losses with the cancellation of the Tyson fight, explained Mr Straw last week, that had decisively influenced his decision to alter the law of the land and admit a convicted rapist.</p> <p>Thus the Labour Party enters its centennial year: as the declared enemy of liberalism and of the use of the state to redistribute wealth; an uncertain custodian of public services, and the firm friend in every circumstance of business, entrepreneurship and profit. It is a breathtaking political repositioning, leaving liberal and social-democratic Britain with only the Liberal Democrats to champion its values and beliefs. Mr Straw and Mr Blair congratulate themselves on their courage and political nous. The Observer disagrees.</p> <p>Mr Straw's hostility to woolly Hampstead liberals comes from his belief that they live in another world to those in British housing estates. For the latter, noisy neighbours, teenagers running amok and courts that side with the perpetrators of crime rather than the victims are the real enemies of the people. Mr Straw believes that he is on their side, and not that of the lofty idealists in privileged north London.</p> <p>But Mr Straw is fundamentally wrong. Britain has no written constitution to embody its liberal political and social values. Rather its tolerant and liberal society has been built up over centuries by profound social forces calling for justice, fairness and moderation. The populist culture of repression and retribution expressed by Mr Straw has no echo in our literature or political philosophy. He will look hard to find any support in Shakespeare, Dickens, Locke or Russell for the views he now champions. The abysmal conditions on our housing estates cannot be solved by overthrowing the elements of liberalism in our criminal justice system. The British look to our Home Secretaries to sustain our liberalism, not use the power conferred on them by an unwritten constitution to bury it.</p> <p>So Mr Straw is wrong to construct a two-tier justice system in which the right to trial is not available for a wide range of cases in magistrates' courts. He is wrong to champion a Freedom of Information Act which gives so much discretion to the Government over what will be 'freely available'. Wrong to overturn the rule of law in the Tyson case to protect commercial interests. Wrong to construct a system in which asylum seekers are reduced to poverty-stricken mendicants with no rights. And wrong to seek to associate himself with every populist cause, whatever its rights and wrongs.</p> <p>For where the woolly-minded liberals are right is that liberalism - a respect for rights, for justice and for liberty on which not only free markets but just societies are built - is an indivisible set of political and moral propositions. This, though it might shock him, is a view that is deeply shared in Britain by rich and poor alike even if not openly articulated. It is part of our heritage and in our blood. Mr Straw holds those who take this view in contempt, a constituency which includes The Observer, its writers and many of its readers. We return the contempt - tolerantly - but with interest.</p>",

The only constituency and philosophy that draws its uncritical admiration is business. It was the fact that businesses in Manchester might make losses with the cancellation of the Tyson fight, explained Mr Straw last week, that had decisively influenced his decision to alter the law of the land and admit a convicted rapist. Thus the Labour Party enters its centennial year: as the declared enemy of liberalism and of the use of the state to redistribute wealth; an uncertain custodian of public services, and the firm friend in every circumstance of business, entrepreneurship and profit. It is a breathtaking political repositioning, leaving liberal and social-democratic Britain with only the Liberal Democrats to champion its values and beliefs. Mr Straw and Mr Blair congratulate themselves on their courage and political nous. The Observer disagrees. Mr Straw's hostility to woolly Hampstead liberals comes from his belief that they live in another world to those in British housing estates. For the latter, noisy neighbours, teenagers running amok and courts that side with the perpetrators of crime rather than the victims are the real enemies of the people. Mr Straw believes that he is on their side, and not that of the lofty idealists in privileged north London. But Mr Straw is fundamentally wrong. Britain has no written constitution to embody its liberal political and social values. Rather its tolerant and liberal society has been built up over centuries by profound social forces calling for justice, fairness and moderation. The populist culture of repression and retribution expressed by Mr Straw has no echo in our literature or political philosophy. He will look hard to find any support in Shakespeare, Dickens, Locke or Russell for the views he now champions. The abysmal conditions on our housing estates cannot be solved by overthrowing the elements of liberalism in our criminal justice system. The British look to our Home Secretaries to sustain our liberalism, not use the power conferred on them by an unwritten constitution to bury it. So Mr Straw is wrong to construct a two-tier justice system in which the right to trial is not available for a wide range of cases in magistrates' courts. He is wrong to champion a Freedom of Information Act which gives so much discretion to the Government over what will be 'freely available'. Wrong to overturn the rule of law in the Tyson case to protect commercial interests. Wrong to construct a system in which asylum seekers are reduced to poverty-stricken mendicants with no rights. And wrong to seek to associate himself with every populist cause, whatever its rights and wrongs. For where the woolly-minded liberals are right is that liberalism - a respect for rights, for justice and for liberty on which not only free markets but just societies are built - is an indivisible set of political and moral propositions. This, though it might shock him, is a view that is deeply shared in Britain by rich and poor alike even if not openly articulated. It is part of our heritage and in our blood. Mr Straw holds those who take this view in contempt, a constituency which includes The Observer, its writers and many of its readers. We return the contempt - tolerantly - but with interest.",

      "body": "<p>Sometimes I wish there was a quirky answer to the weight loss issue - 'eating grapefruit after every meal will extinguish all the calories consumed', or 'drinking a herbal tea at 6pm will cause body fat to disintegrate for ever'. I wish!</p> <p>Despite the fact that hundreds of books profess to have found the answer in some unsubstantiated, wacky theory, the truth is that weight loss is based on a simple equation: eat fewer calories than you expend. For this reason, just getting more exercise will help you to lose weight if you already eat well. Calorie counting can be counter-productive, so the best way to plan your diet is to know what you're eating, and to eat well - but not overeat - within these guidelines.</p> <p>One area that people neglect when they think about weight loss is the mouth. Because of food manufacturers' slimming campaigns, we resort to eating foods that have had all the taste and goodness removed. Diet and slimline foods are a con - they lead you to think that they're the only way to lose weight. Their poor taste does nothing more than make you feel that eating is something you get over and done with - the only pounds you'll lose are those from your purse, as often the fat and sugars have been replaced with other calorific substances to disguise the poor taste.</p> <p>Eating in a way that sends plentiful signals back to your fullness centre (located in the brain, within the hypothalamus) should involve more than filling yourself up with low calorie or 'lite' foods - this is a negative and destructive mind-set. There's no difference between a large amount of a low-calorie dish, or a small amount of a high-calorie one. You can eat the foods you love, as your brain will receive copious signals to its fullness, rather than hunger centre, due to your body being satisfied sooner with the foods you actually enjoy eating. Hence you will devour fewer calories. A few simple tips can help you maximise satisfaction:</p> <p>\u0095 Chew your food - don't gulp. Within the jaw are stretch receptors which respond when you chew. The more you chew, the greater the feeling of fullness. <br></p> <p>\u0095 Try to include some fibre within each meal. Fibres (present in fruits, vegetables, grains, pulses etc) swell in the presence of water and trigger stretch receptors also present in the stomach lining, which send signals of fullness to the satiety centre in the brain. <br></p> <p>\u0095 Keep your taste buds on their toes. Foods with the highest satiety value are those with several organoleptic qualities - they look, smell, feel and taste good; they even sound good. Juggle textures, tastes or temperatures within a meal, munch one mouthful of chicken and follow with grilled vegetables. This way, you'll be full more quickly than by eating all the chicken first and then moving on to the vegetables (as children often do); the brain will fail to recognise you're meant to be feeling full. Eating the same food, mouthful after mouthful, is rather like having sex in the same position all the time - boring and unsatisfying! <br></p> <p>\u0095 Concentrate on your food; you'll feel more satisfied than eating while you're distracted.<br></p> <p>\u0095 Practically everything you put in your mouth provides calories (units of energy). Gram for gram, carbohydrates and proteins provide less than half the calories of fat. Foods with a high percentage of water (such as fruit and vegetables) have fewer calories than those with a high percentage of fat (butter or cream).</p> <p><b>Fat</b></p> <p>We all need some fat in our diets to carry important fat-soluble vitamins, to help our bodies produce and regulate hormones, and to provide flavour. However, fats are concentrated sources of calories, so one of the best ways to reduce your calorie intake is to reduce your fat intake. A common mistake is to think that margarines and oils have fewer calories than butter; they don't. Unless you have a cholesterol problem, I think the best way to treat fat is to use one you like the taste of, be it butter or extra-virgin olive oil, but keep the quantity down. To cut fat intake:<br></p> <p>\u0095 Choose the best quality fish, leanest meat and poultry (cut fat off), or vegetables, and cook simply. Grill a fillet steak or wrap a trout in foil and bake to seal in the flavour, rather than smothering them in creamy sauces. Chargrilling gives a tasty slant to vegetables, fish and lean meats and a little fat is needed to stop the food from sticking. <br></p> <p>\u0095 Instead of cream, base sauces on tomato, or a reduction of wine, perhaps with yoghurt. <br></p> <p>\u0095 Experiment with yoghurt in dishes where you would use cream. It can be added to soups, served with vegetables such as baked potatoes, and used in salad dressings. Serve it with fresh fruit salad or mix it with fruit compote to make a dessert sauce. <br></p> <p>\u0095 Watch the pastries, fried and battered foods - they're loaded with fat. <br></p> <p>\u0095 It's better to stick to normal-fat foods and just keep the quantity down.</p> <p><b>Protein</b></p> <p>Keep your protein intake balanced - most people should aim to eat a chicken breast-sized portion of lean protein (meat, fish, chicken etc) for their main meal and roughly half this with their lunch/snack. Vegetarians should make sure they're not loading up on the cheese, nuts and oils; these can change a normal protein-rich lentil dish into a high-calorie meal.</p> <p><b>Sugars</b></p> <p>Natural sugars are found in fruit and vegetables. Refined sugars (which include honey, white and brown sugar) are found in soft drinks, cakes, biscuits, jams and other preserves. All sugar has the same number of calories but refined sugars are the ones to avoid as far as possible, as they provide 'empty' calories - there's no positive nutritional benefit from eating them.</p> <p>Fresh fruit and fruit desserts will satisfy your sweet tooth at the same time and they contribute valuable vitamins and minerals. Fruit also provides fibre, the weight-loser's ally. The reason why people are often confused when they look at food labels is that sometimes sugar is called carbohydrate. Sugar is one form of carbohydrate, the other is starch, both providing the same number of calories.</p> <p>As with sugars, starches can be natural or refined. Foods containing refined starch - sugary breakfast cereals, biscuits and cakes, white bread and pasta, white rice - tend to be less satisfying because they have lost fibre in the refining process, resulting in your wanting to eat more of them, which is when you can easily put on weight.</p> <p>But natural high-fibre starches are found in wholegrain, wholemeal and wholewheat breakfast cereals, flour, bread, pasta, brown rice, potatoes, lentils, chickpeas and beans, bananas, parsnips and other root vegetables. These high-fibre starches provide a good base for a weight-loss plan.</p> <p>However, don't make the mistake of adding lots of fat or sugar to them - have just a little butter and a high-fibre fruit jam on your wholemeal toast in the morning. High-fibre starches also don't aggravate hunger and energy levels; they're processed by the body at a slow, steady pace, whereas sugary foods are digested and absorbed into the blood very quickly. Rapid changes in your blood sugar level can cause your body to go into 'overeat' mode - eating a chocolate bar may give you an energy lift, but its sugar content is dealt with by the body in a way that is followed by a drop in blood sugar level, and you will soon be ravenously hungry again.</p> <p>This said, carbohydrates don't seem to work for everyone - some people find they lose weight or feel a lot slimmer if they keep the quantity of high-fibre starches down and get calories from proteins, fruits, vegetables and some dairy products. There is no physiological reason for this, but it's worth a try if your body's not changing - it may just give you the psychological boost you need.</p> <p>Talking of fibre, incorporate plenty of vegetables and fruits - they're rich in fibre and relatively low in calories. Aim for six portions of fresh fruits or vegetables a day. There is generally no limit to the non-root vegetables (spinach, peas etc), as they have so few calories, but you need to watch fruits and roots; they can contain quite a lot of fructose (fruit sugar) and calories if eaten in too great a quantity. Make them tasty and interesting - use a small quantity of good quality olive oil to dress salads and grilled vegetables.</p> <p>Don't forget the water - aim to drink around 2.5 litres a day. This enables your body to glean essential nutrients, helps fibre to swell, and refreshes the palate as you're eating, meaning your next mouthful will set those taste buds tingling.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A week of fevered plotting over the Pope's future has turned surreal with claims that John Paul II, a former actor, is faking his illness. Few doubt that his trembling, immobility and pain are genuine, but the hunt is on for who planted the story - and why. The Pope, 79, has striven to orchestrate a successor in his own mould but claims that he is exaggerating his sickness to wrongfoot opponents have shocked Vatican officials. Cardinals jockeying to be the next pontiff have been thrown into disarray by the conflicting rumours sweeping Rome. The timing of John Paul's death or retirement will be crucial to deciding who is chosen to lead the world's one billion Catholics. Suggestions that the Pope was exploiting skills acquired from treading the boards more than 50 years ago in his native Poland were scorned, but they fuelled suspicions of rival disinformation campaigns. 'It is total nonsense, the man is clearly very, very ill, but nothing in this place is said without a reason,' said one senior Vatican official. 'Even if it is just to kick up dust, it benefits the one who does it by confusing those who don't know where it comes from.' Reports in the Italian newspapers La Repubblica and Il Giornale said the Pope, who was elected in 1978, planned to retire next year to a Polish monastery after jubilee year celebrations are completed. Under canon law 322 a Pope can 'freely' renounce his office. The first to do it was Celestine V in 1294. Gregory XII tried in 1406 but botched it and ended up deposed.

As a consultant surgeon, I spend every day of my working life struggling to cope with totally inadequate facilities. The NHS is a national disgrace. The public are only just waking up to this fact, partly because politicians are always telling them how good it is. The patients who use the service know otherwise. It is grossly underfunded and failing miserably. I have cancer patients queuing up at home waiting for surgery because of a lack of beds, overstretched resources, too few specialist surgeons and inadequate operating-room facilities. A flu epidemic may put the NHS in the spotlight briefly but it is up to the media to keep up the pressure on government and campaign for action. Money really is the answer, and lots of it.<br><strong>Richard Hardwick MD FRCS</strong><br>Heath, Cardiff </p> <p>\u0095Most sensible and fair-minded people will agree with your leader, printed last Sunday, that the NHS has to be properly funded. They will also realise that this can only be done from income-related taxation. However, I would suggest that not only the NHS falls within this sphere but also education, transport and welfare, including the state pension. The Government must be honest and explain to the public that these four vital services are the responsibility of government, answerable to the people, and therefore have to be paid for by us all. </p> <p>The role of government is not, as over the past 20 years, to pander to greed and short-term opportunism, thus resulting in the present difficul ties. The role of government is to lead, to inform, to educate and to gain public acceptance of the measures needed to maintain a civilised society, in both the short, and the long term. We did this after 1945, when the country was near bankrupt; surely we can do it again with today's increasing prosperity.<br><strong> Clifford Fuller</strong><br>Gloucester</p>",

I have cancer patients queuing up at home waiting for surgery because of a lack of beds, overstretched resources, too few specialist surgeons and inadequate operating-room facilities. A flu epidemic may put the NHS in the spotlight briefly but it is up to the media to keep up the pressure on government and campaign for action. Money really is the answer, and lots of it. Richard Hardwick MD FRCS Heath, Cardiff \u0095Most sensible and fair-minded people will agree with your leader, printed last Sunday, that the NHS has to be properly funded. They will also realise that this can only be done from income-related taxation. However, I would suggest that not only the NHS falls within this sphere but also education, transport and welfare, including the state pension. The Government must be honest and explain to the public that these four vital services are the responsibility of government, answerable to the people, and therefore have to be paid for by us all. The role of government is not, as over the past 20 years, to pander to greed and short-term opportunism, thus resulting in the present difficul ties. The role of government is to lead, to inform, to educate and to gain public acceptance of the measures needed to maintain a civilised society, in both the short, and the long term. We did this after 1945, when the country was near bankrupt; surely we can do it again with today's increasing prosperity. Clifford Fuller Gloucester",

      "body": "<p>The downside of fast food, or for that matter anything impromptu, is the absence of anticipation. Don't get me wrong - I am all for something spontaneous on the kitchen table from time to time, but equally, I like a bit of notice, something to say that supper is a sure thing. In my house, in culinary terms, this means a little bowl of olives, a few slices cut from a salami and, sometimes, a plate of crisp zucchini, lightly floured and chucked into hot oil, or some melon with prosciutto - what the Italians call antipasto, and meaning, literally, before the main meal. </p> <p>The British have never been very good at this culinary foreplay, tending to either overachieve with fussy little canap\u00e9s or taking the slob's route of emptying out a bag of Twiglets and saying, 'Help yourself.' The Italians do it in style, of course, and far more importantly, they understand that what you want at that point in the proceedings is something to stimulate and tempt, and to give you an appetite. Or as Marcella Hazan, the recently retired doyenne of Italian cookery writing, puts it so graphically: 'to set the gastric juices in motion'. </p> <p>Antipasto is a restaurant thing, really, but I cannot think of eating dinner at home without something to nibble first. You know, that six-o'clock feeling when a bottle begs to be opened and you need something to nibble with it. To be honest, the whole thing is usually deeply informal in my house, with some thin, chewy salami and a dish of olives put on the table to be picked at as I get the rest of the meal ready. A great favourite is nothing more than some bread, admittedly very good bread, and a little dish of olive oil for dunking it in. The more fickle foodies have suddenly become very snooty about this particular antipasto and have started to grandly wave it aside. This sort of foodie one-upmanship drives me quite mad. Have none of their silliness - dunking good bread in deeply fruity olive oil is a delightful way to get those juices flowing. </p> <p>If someone is coming over for supper, then I will do something hot, too, not to show off, but because hot antipasti such as suppli, the tiny deep-fried balls of rice and melting cheese, or mussels baked with breadcrumbs and garlic are as tempting as nibbles get. Unless you get carried away, no antipasti is a great deal of work - neither should it be - and anyway, who is to know that the suppli were made with yesterday's risotto? Bruscetta, its crunchy bread dripping with heady garlic and new season's olive oil, falls into this category, too. I should mention here that antipasto also allows you time to tinker with whatever is to follow. </p> <p>Let me tempt you further. Involtini di melanzane are slices of aubergine that have been stuffed with olives, toasted breadcrumbs and pecorino cheese, then rolled and baked, to be eaten warm; oysters are often eaten at this point, too, baked with breadcrumbs and grated Parmesan; garnet-coloured figs can come with chopped mint and lemon juice, or you could end up with the thinnest slices of San Daniele ham with pieces of melon so ripe they weep sweet juice on the way to your mouth. </p> <p>Then there is the seafood antipasti: the aforementioned baked mussels and oysters, but also clams steamed with white wine, garlic and parsley or gamberetti all'olio e limone, shrimps steamed and peeled and marinated with olive oil, lemon juice and black pepper, and anchovies, too, usually with crusty bread and sweet, unsalted butter. </p> <p>Tempting though they are, I do think you shouldn't go overboard. The point is to tease the palate rather than to satiate it. This is why antipasto is so often laid out by the door in restaurants in Italy, so you get a hint of them on your way to the table. Too many at home would look silly and, as anyone who has tried to prepare Turkish mezze knows, lots of diminutive dishes can take forever to prepare. </p> <p>If several people are due, by which I mean about six, then I think you can offer five or six little dishes, but it is essential that some of them are simple, both for the cook and the eater. Sweet and milky mozzarella di buffala drizzled with olive oil, some figs - there are still a few around - and the sweetest melon you can find. Do you sprinkle salt on yours? It really brings out the honeyed sweetness. Whatever, I do think that the majority of antipasti should be something that requires little or no work. These are only nibbles after all, albeit quietly stylish Italian ones. </p> <p><strong> Suppli</strong><br> Those who have learned to read recipes through before they start to cook (a lot of us don't, apparently) will probably spot that you could easily use a bit of yesterday's risotto for this. And of course you can, the only proviso being that it must be thick enough to hold its shape. If you detest deep-frying, you may prefer to flatten the balls into patties and shallow-fry them. The effect is much the same, though they are somewhat inauthentic and, in a way, lose just a little of their charm. Either way, the magic lies in the way the cheese melts into long strings. Makes 12 to 15, which is enough for 6 as part of an antipasto </p> <p>30g butter </p> <p>1 small onion </p> <p>5 tbsps risotto rice </p> <p>500ml hot stock (bouillon powder or even a stock cube </p> <p>is fine here) </p> <p>30g Parmesan, grated </p> <p>1 egg </p> <p>1 ball of mozzarella (about 125g) </p> <p>nutmeg </p> <p>beaten egg and fresh breadcrumbs for coating </p> <p>groundnut oil for deep frying </p> <p>Melt the butter in a shallow-sided pan over a low heat. Peel and finely chop the onion and let it cook in the butter until it is tender and transparent, stirring it to keep it from sticking. Stir in the rice, then add a ladleful of stock, turning the heat up a bit so it starts to boil. As the rice absorbs the stock, add more, letting it almost but not quite disappear before adding the next ladleful. Go on until the rice is creamy and thick, but still has a bit of a bite to it. You may not need quite all of the stock. Stir in the grated Parmesan, then spread the risotto, for that is what it is, over a large plate so that it cools and sets. </p> <p>Beat the egg briefly in a large bowl, then cut the mozzarella into small cubes and add it, along with the cooled rice. Season the mixture with salt, black pepper and a little very finely grated nutmeg. Scoop the mixture into balls. The size is up to you, but I think they should be a two-bite ball, about the size of a golf ball. Set them out on a baking sheet or plate to set a little, then get ready a plate each of beaten egg and fine fresh breadcrumbs. </p> <p>The next bit is inevitably messy. Roll the balls gently in the beaten egg and then in the breadcrumbs, setting them aside on a plate. Warm the oil in a deep pan. I dislike deep-frying, so I tend to fry them in about 5cm of oil, three at a time, turning them once to cook the other side and keeping the finished ones hot in the oven. </p> <p>To be really good, they must be eaten hot, so that the cheese forms long, hanging strings. </p> <p><strong> Insalata di peperoni arrostiti</strong><br> Many cooks suggest grilling the peppers before skinning and dressing them. I rarely find this leaves them tender enough. If this dish is to be good, then the peppers must be meltingly soft and positively silky to the touch. There are two ways to do this. Either roast them until the skins are black, then peel and dress them, or grill them, tear away the charred skins, then cut them into wide strips and fry slowly in lots of good olive oil. Either way will give you peppers that are seriously tender. Enough for 4 as part of an antipasti </p> <p>2 large, long red peppers </p> <p>olive oil </p> <p>6 anchovy fillets </p> <p>1 tbsp capers </p> <p>basil leaves - a small handful </p> <p>Wipe the peppers and lay them in a shallow, ovenproof dish (you want to save any juices that escape as they cook) and put them under a hot grill, about 15cm away from the heat. Leave them until they are charred and black, turning them as each side blackens. Remove from the heat and cover the dish with a tea towel so the peppers steam briefly, making the skin easier to peel. </p> <p>When they have cooled just enough to handle, peel off the blackened skin - it should tear away in crisp strips - and discard it. I don't rinse them under running water, as some people suggest. This can remove some of the sweet juices that help to make this dish so toothsome. Cut the peeled peppers into wide strips and set them aside. </p> <p>Warm 2 tbsps of olive oil in a shallow pan and add the peppers. Let them soften in the warm oil, stewing slowly to tenderness. They should, I think, be on the verge of collapse. Meanwhile, rinse the anchovies and capers and gently pat them dry, then transfer the peppers to a serving dish, the simpler the better, and toss gently with a little new oil, the anchovies, capers and some torn basil leaves. </p> <p> <strong> Fried artichokes with lemon and mint</strong><br> There is nothing especially authentic about this. It is just something I make at home when I want some hot and almost effortless antipasti. Serves 4 as an antipasto </p> <p>12 small artichokes in oil </p> <p>extra-virgin olive oil </p> <p>1 lemon </p> <p>12 mint leaves, chopped </p> <p><strong> for the batter</strong><br> 50g plain flour </p> <p>1 tbsp sunflower oil </p> <p>80ml sparkling mineral water </p> <p>1 egg white </p> <p>groundnut oil for deep-frying </p> <p><strong> to serve </strong><br> a little sea salt, finely chopped mint and some wedges of lemon </p> <p>Cut the artichokes in half. Pour over just enough olive oil to cover them (you can use it again once you have drained them) and squeeze in the juice of half the lemon and the chopped mint leaves. Set aside overnight, if you can; if not, then for a good couple of hours. </p> <p>Make the batter half an hour or so before you need it. Don't be tempted to skip this - the resting time is essential for a light batter. Sift the flour with a good pinch of salt, then beat in the oil and mineral water with a fork. Set aside. </p> <p>Drain the artichokes. Beat the egg white until it is stiff and fluffy, then fold it into the batter. Get the frying oil hot. Submerge the artichokes in the batter, then slide them into the hot oil. Submerge them, holding them down with a draining spoon, until they are golden light and crisp. Drain them on kitchen paper and grind a little salt, scatter some chopped mint and serve in a little white dish with a wedge of lemon.</p>",

This can remove some of the sweet juices that help to make this dish so toothsome. Cut the peeled peppers into wide strips and set them aside. Warm 2 tbsps of olive oil in a shallow pan and add the peppers. Let them soften in the warm oil, stewing slowly to tenderness. They should, I think, be on the verge of collapse. Meanwhile, rinse the anchovies and capers and gently pat them dry, then transfer the peppers to a serving dish, the simpler the better, and toss gently with a little new oil, the anchovies, capers and some torn basil leaves. Fried artichokes with lemon and mint There is nothing especially authentic about this. It is just something I make at home when I want some hot and almost effortless antipasti. Serves 4 as an antipasto 12 small artichokes in oil extra-virgin olive oil 1 lemon 12 mint leaves, chopped for the batter 50g plain flour 1 tbsp sunflower oil 80ml sparkling mineral water 1 egg white groundnut oil for deep-frying to serve a little sea salt, finely chopped mint and some wedges of lemon Cut the artichokes in half. Pour over just enough olive oil to cover them (you can use it again once you have drained them) and squeeze in the juice of half the lemon and the chopped mint leaves. Set aside overnight, if you can; if not, then for a good couple of hours. Make the batter half an hour or so before you need it. Don't be tempted to skip this - the resting time is essential for a light batter. Sift the flour with a good pinch of salt, then beat in the oil and mineral water with a fork. Set aside. Drain the artichokes. Beat the egg white until it is stiff and fluffy, then fold it into the batter. Get the frying oil hot. Submerge the artichokes in the batter, then slide them into the hot oil. Submerge them, holding them down with a draining spoon, until they are golden light and crisp. Drain them on kitchen paper and grind a little salt, scatter some chopped mint and serve in a little white dish with a wedge of lemon.",

It is certainly essential for any organic garden, as it embodies the principle of organics, recycling waste in any form and returning it to the soil to enrich future plant growth, which, in turn, will provide the raw material for future compost. The organic garden can never have too much waste or too much compost. </p> <p>The process of making compost has the same magic as breadmaking. Both rely on experience, performance and natural function and are satisfyingly poised between success and failure. It is also an important element in reducing landfill sites. A staggering half of all household waste is easily compostable in the garden. </p> <p>I know that, to the unconverted, compost has all the allure of filling in a tax return. Somehow one feels that composting is not, and never will be, the new sex. I think the answer lies in the compost itself. For, according to a recent survey made by the Centre for Alternative Technology (CAT), most gardeners go through the motions of making compost but fail to make it in any acceptable form. People bang on about the importance and beauty of sweet-smelling, rich, crumbly stuff that looks, smells and feels like exceptionally rich soil, yet it seems that the most common experience is of an unpleasant-smelling sludge occupied by the odd rat. </p> <p> The CAT survey found that, while everyone knew what 'good' compost was, no one was able to agree on exactly how to make it. Some said there should be holes in the container, others said you must use an activator and others still that you should make aerating holes in the heap. And these were just the experts. </p> <p>They did, however, agree on the need to turn the compost, ideally every three weeks. </p> <p>But the one certainty that came from CAT's investigations was that almost no one turns their compost at all, let alone every three weeks. This was partly due to human frailty and partly because it is horribly hard work if the compost heap reaches any size - which it must do if it is to generate enough heat. So, advising people to turn their compost every month is a waste of time. CAT tested tumbler-type compost makers and found them to be useless. They simply inverted the waste rather than mixing it up. </p> <p>So they did some experiments and found that composting works best if the initial ratio of the ingredients is about 30 parts carbon to one part nitrogen. More carbon, and the process will be slower; more nitrogen, and the result will be too slimy and undecomposed. Conventional advice is that you layer your compost material, mixing up the drier carbon with the wetter green stuff. But in real life, it all gets chucked on as and when. Kitchen waste is always high in nitrogen, and the smaller the household, the less carbon there is likely to be. Grass clippings - the most common component of compost heaps - have half the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio that is needed. Conscientious householders who liberally lace their compost heap with an activator - also high in nitrogen - just compound the problem. The result is not compost but said sludge. </p> <p>However, there is a solution: add more carbon. Straw is ideal for this. If garden centres sold straw in small bales for composting, that would solve the problem at a stroke. Mix grass clippings with an equal volume of straw and they rot down beautifully. But it is hard enough getting straw in the countryside, as most of it is made into huge bales, let alone in a town. </p> <p>CAT went back to the drawing board and had a brainwave. Paper - wastepaper - is the solution. It is biochemically similar to straw, being essentially partly digested cellulose, and available to every household. We fill our bin bags with huge quantities of paper and cardboard packaging every week - as much as 40 per cent of all landfill matter - from cereal packets to kitchen towels. Put it all on the compost heap, and not only will it rot down to provide good compost, but it will also dramatically reduce the amount of landfill. That way you get to save your garden, your soul and the planet in one fell swoop. </p> <p>Aspects of this method seemed to confound all previous conventions. For one, it hardly heated up, as most of the compost was generated by invertebrate activity - mainly from brandling worms, which love wet paper, and also from woodlice and slugs, nematodes, beetles and centipedes. They all ate the compost and then excreted it politely at the bottom of the heap. After about a year, only the 'worm compost' (invertebrate dung by any other name) remained. Perfect. There was no evidence that turning was required, although it might have speeded up the process. It was necessary to keep the compost moist, but the best heaps were open ones kept damp by rainfall. They also found that the bigger the surface area, the better (the minimum being a square metre) and that it should not be too high. A wide, low pile decomposes faster because most activity is from the bottom up. </p> <p>I have been experimenting with this for the past six months, and it works like a dream. It is astonishing how much invertebrate activity is created by the presence of a few bits of cardboard and paper. Crumple up smaller stuff and tear up cardboard boxes. You want as large a surface area as possible exposed to other compost material. Paper should be mixed in with vegetable waste rather than in lasagne-like layers, and it is better to cover cardboard or paper with nitrogenous stuff such as grass clippings. The system works.

Last Tues day, it was just another libel case that began. The usher carefully writes out COURT FULL on a scrap of paper and hangs it on the door. The wind moans and wails in the double-glazing. The scholar with the appalling cough is barking to death on a diet of Strepsils; the ginger-haired lad who stenotypes the record glares at him without sympathy. And three upper-class Englishmen - a judge, a barrister and David Irving - are having a civilised conversation about the darkness at the end of the world. </p> <p>All the same, there are invisible last chances in the room. The first is about handing on truth. It is 55 years this month since Soviet troops entered what was left of Auschwitz: the Nazis had dynamited the gas chambers and the Russians now set fire to the typhus-infested huts. Those who saw what happened there and elsewhere, to Jews and to the other human categories redefined as vermin, are today few and near the end of their lives. </p> <p>Idealists, like some of those vigilant old people on the public benches, dream that this trial will culminate in a mighty rite of transmission. It will lay out one last time the evidence about what was done in the Holocaust (to how many, by whom, in what manner and why). The young generations will lose the voice of the witnesses. But they will be armed instead with a judgment. </p> <p>The other last chance, more convincing, is Irving's. For something like 40 years, this strange figure - historian or chronicler or propagandist - has laboured at a single gigantic project which could be called (begging some questions) the rehabilitation of Adolf Hitler. Book after book, lecture after lecture and libel action after libel action, Irving has slogged on with the world's most unpopular historical enterprise. His skill at sniffing out unknown Third Reich documents is a legend. But the way he chooses to interpret them has so far condemned him to failure. </p> <p>This trial may be his last throw, although he has a similar action pending against this paper. Last week in Court 37, Irving hurled himself at those he regards as his real foes. In the person of Professor Deborah Lipstadt, he is trying to defeat a new generation of Jewish-American intellectuals, who have spread their own version of 'Holocaust Studies' and defined 'Holocaust Denial' as an offence - in some places, as a crime. </p> <p>The declared purpose of Irving's libel suit is to punish them for calling him a 'Holocaust Denier', and thereby allegedly wrecking his career. Irving accepts that an enormous slaughter of European Jews took place. What he disputes is its scale, circumstances and authorship. He will bring witnesses to 'prove' the Auschwitz gas chambers were mostly mythical. He refuses to accept the killing as 'systematic'. And he insists Hitler didn't know and wouldn't have approved. </p> <p>But if Irving were to win this case, the impact would be far greater than damages. At the last possible moment, his reputation as a credible historian would be salvaged. His version of Hitler and the Holocaust would be given a degree of plausibility. </p> <p>A last chance for David Irving in Court 37 - that can be argued. But a last chance for truth and history? Watching last week, I remembered the saying that for establishing what really happened in history an English libel court is the worst place in the world. </p> <p>That saying emerged, as far as I remember, from one of the most famous, spectacular and (for once) really important libel suits of the last century, the 'Cossacks Trial' of 1989 in which Lord Aldington sued Count Tolstoy. Tolstoy had blamed him for the handover of 70,000 anti-Soviet Russian soldiers to Stalin's vengeance at the end of the last war. </p> <p>Aldington won: the jury awarded him \u00a31.5 million damages. But in the process the trial churned the business of historical inquiry into a sort of Passchendaele of fear and confusion. The jury found that Aldington was not to blame but the trial actually made it far harder to find out who was really responsible for the only serious war crime committed by the British Army in World War II. </p> <p>The judge lopes in with a sort of athletic impatience, and as we rise I recognise in Mr Justice Gray that Charles Gray QC who was Aldington's barrister 11 years ago. And here - ironic, relentless - comes Richard Rampton QC, counsel for Lipstadt and Penguin Books. He fits his wig on, and reveals himself as the man who was Count Tolstoy's advocate and Charles Gray's duelling opponent. </p> <p>Well, there. Both men did their best for their clients, and neither is to blame for the way that trial reduced history to toxic sludge. But the tale of the Jewish Holocaust, the worst deliberate act in modern European history, is like the Cossack tragedy in two ways: it is neither entirely simple nor entirely known. </p> <p>There are areas piled high with documentation - passenger lists, death lists, crematorium blueprints. But there are also huge gaps. How many died? We are less certain about that than 20 years ago. Did Hitler know, did he order it? I am certain he did. But the signed directive, even the secondary letter or phone note confirming this, has never been found. What chance is there that this trial in London will clear up mysteries and bring clarity rather than thicken the fog? </p> <p>It's unfair to say an English libel trial is not about truth. It has something to do with proof, after all. But above all it is about people. It is about the personalities of libel litigants, the way they can be made to seem liars and cheats or selfless victims, their breaking-strain under interrogation, their motives for suing. This trial is unusual. Given the wall-stacks of documents, largely in German, the parties agreed that a jury would be overwhelmed, So Mr Justice Gray will decide verdict, costs and any damages on his own, without even a pair of lay judges or assessors to help him. </p> <p>And David Irving has no lawyer. He is conducting his own case. This is impressive, but it means the judge has to make allowances for any amateurism and make sure Irving knows his rights. As for Lipstadt, she has decided not to testify. She sits quietly in the front row, busy with her laptop, looking unhappy. </p> <p>All week, Irving has been defending his reputation, while Richard Rampton seeks to prove he is a liar and distorter. Irving, at bay, hunches giant blue-suited shoulders around his ears, his eyes glittering like a badger's. Fragments of history are snatched out of context, dried, treated and used as firelighters to scorch an adversary. </p> <p>We spend hours on the timing of a scribbled Himmler phone-note about how a transport of Berlin Jews should be treated in Riga, on a bugged conversation between captured SS men in London about whether somebody said he had an order from Hitler to kill Latvian Jews, on the meanings of words such as Vernichtung (destruction) or Judentum (Jewry). </p> <p>The civilised voices fence on. But they drop names too, and the shadows of human beings flit across Court 37: SS monsters from the pit such as Odilo Globocnik and Dieter Wisliceny. Or the unnamed human reality of that Judentransport steaming from Berlin towards death in Riga (whose grandfathers, whose maiden aunts?). </p> <p>Once, in a bout with Rampton over whether the F\u00fchrer had ordered the extermination of the Jews, David Irving reminded him that no signed order had been found. That, said Rampton, was just negative evidence. Noisily, Irving retorted: 'I have to remind you of the basic principle of English law that a man is innocent until he is proved guilty: am I right?' </p> <p>And at that second there was a tiny stillness in Court 37. We were talking about Adolf Hitler.</p>",

It is about the personalities of libel litigants, the way they can be made to seem liars and cheats or selfless victims, their breaking-strain under interrogation, their motives for suing. This trial is unusual. Given the wall-stacks of documents, largely in German, the parties agreed that a jury would be overwhelmed, So Mr Justice Gray will decide verdict, costs and any damages on his own, without even a pair of lay judges or assessors to help him. And David Irving has no lawyer. He is conducting his own case. This is impressive, but it means the judge has to make allowances for any amateurism and make sure Irving knows his rights. As for Lipstadt, she has decided not to testify. She sits quietly in the front row, busy with her laptop, looking unhappy. All week, Irving has been defending his reputation, while Richard Rampton seeks to prove he is a liar and distorter. Irving, at bay, hunches giant blue-suited shoulders around his ears, his eyes glittering like a badger's. Fragments of history are snatched out of context, dried, treated and used as firelighters to scorch an adversary. We spend hours on the timing of a scribbled Himmler phone-note about how a transport of Berlin Jews should be treated in Riga, on a bugged conversation between captured SS men in London about whether somebody said he had an order from Hitler to kill Latvian Jews, on the meanings of words such as Vernichtung (destruction) or Judentum (Jewry). The civilised voices fence on. But they drop names too, and the shadows of human beings flit across Court 37: SS monsters from the pit such as Odilo Globocnik and Dieter Wisliceny. Or the unnamed human reality of that Judentransport steaming from Berlin towards death in Riga (whose grandfathers, whose maiden aunts?). Once, in a bout with Rampton over whether the F\u00fchrer had ordered the extermination of the Jews, David Irving reminded him that no signed order had been found. That, said Rampton, was just negative evidence. Noisily, Irving retorted: 'I have to remind you of the basic principle of English law that a man is innocent until he is proved guilty: am I right?' And at that second there was a tiny stillness in Court 37. We were talking about Adolf Hitler.",

      "trailText": "<p>Observer journalist  John Sweeney  last week went undercover as a hospital porter as the NHS reached crisis point. His story is one of chaos on the wards, but also one of heroic forbearance and unfailing humour among patients and staff</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>My first patient was as frail as a porcelain teapot but, though in her nineties with thin wisps of hair plaited over her head, she was oddly girlish. As the newest hospital porter at St Thomas Hospital, I was to take her from 'transport', where the non-emergency ambulances and taxis come in, to the eye department, in a cumbersome wheelchair. </p> <p>As we pushed off, she said in the poshest rah-rah voice: 'Is this a BMW?' I played Q to her 007: 'All the usual accessories, 007...' </p> <p>And off we went. We got ten yards. To get from the lower ground floor on the Lambeth wing to the eye ward on the ground floor of the north wing is an easy run. If the lifts work. But they don't. A growing throng of walking patients, relatives and the wheelchair-bound waited. And waited. </p> <p>The lift came, we jammed in and spun round to the eye ward. En route, the old lady declared that for the Millennium she had drunk champagne washed down by mulled claret. They have fun, these old biddies. </p> <p>I went back to the lodge to get the next job, to be told: 'Find a wheelchair.' There weren't any. Half an hour later I decanted one old codger from a wheelchair into a normal chair - passing on the problem of moving him to some other poor soul - so that I could whizz back to transport. And wait for the lift going down. And then pick up, and wait for the lift. </p> <p>At 'Tommy's' none of the lift shafts are numbered for easy identification. None of them have a telephone number clearly marked on them, to report faults immediately. The non-medical side of the hospital doesn't just lack money, it lacks confidence, nous, imagination. New lifts are planned, and will happen in two years' time, but somehow that has meant they have almost given up repairing the old ones. </p> <p>Moving patients around is like walking through glue. The computer in the porter's lodge logs in red patients who have had to wait an especially long time. During the day the reds grew and grew, not because the porters were lazy or incompetent, but because the simplest things - getting a lift, finding a wheelchair - didn't work. </p> <p>That first morning another porter showed me around. We picked up an elderly Asian man. He was desperate to get back to his ward on the north wing, but when the lift came it was crowded out with a patient in a bed being moved by another porter. So we waited for the next lift. And waited. The porter and I did a bit of banter, making it easier to switch off the humanity in thewheelchair. Our patient was weeping, silently. The lift had taken so long, he had wet himself. </p> <p>When we got to the ward, the other porter didn't want to have to wipe off the urine, so he dumped the wheelchair by the patient's bed. A nurse ran after us: 'We're really busy, you've got to take that away.' We left it in the corridor, seat still covered in urine. 'You never clean up,' said the porter, 'unless it's a removal' (taking a dead body to the mortuary). </p> <p>Had it not been my first morning - I was new, unsure - I would have argued the point, and cleared it up myself. By the time another porter came along, the urine could have dried and the next patient would have had to sit in another man's piss. This was the only time I saw a porter - or anyone in the hospital - act without humanity. </p> <p>Back at transport... chaos. The controller, a poor wretch of a woman, had a room full of elderly and infirm patients staring miserably into space and, outside, a car park jammed with minicab drivers and non-emergency ambulances, all waiting to move the patients home. And the machine that made sense of it all had switched itself off. Five patients were queueing for her attention. The phone rang, and she barked: 'I've got a complete computer close-down. I've got a wait of at least two hours.' </p> <p>I was dispatched, along with a woman porter who had only been at the hospital four days, to move a patient from an intensive care unit to an ambulance, picking up the ambulance wheel-stretcher first. Neither of us knew where to go. As we traipsed around Accident and Emergency, a stretcher case came in, howling with pain, shoulder dislocated. His girlfriend followed him, carrying tell-tale roller blades. He howled again, a wolf in Lambeth. </p> <p>We found the stretcher, a complicated affair of folding metal struts and the other porter declared: 'I'm crash-trained.' But from her lack of confidence I was worried she didn't know how to work it. She wanted the ambulancemen to come with us, but they wanted a break, so we went to the ward on our own. The patient turned out to be a huge man. 'I'm crash-trained,' my companion told the ward doctor, then started wrestling with the stretcher as if it was some great aluminium crocodile. There was a huge crash as it collapsed to its flat state. So that was what 'crash-trained' meant. </p> <p>The patient lowered himself on to the flat stretcher, and we tried to heave it up. We couldn't do it. The patient got up, and then we had another go. This time it worked, and the patient made it to his ambulance, mysteriously still alive. </p> <p>Another day, another heroic patient. She was beautiful, dark-haired, in her mid-thirties, pale and frail, with an oxygen tube leading to her nostrils, and sitting in her wheelchair reading a fat novel by Vikram Seth. We talked books - her backing Seth, me plumping for Harry Potter - as we headed for the eleventh floor on the north wing. </p> <p>The lift was packed. The press of people was too much for her: 'I'm going to be sick.' Everyone decanted on the tenth, and she started coughing into her hands. The lift treacled up to the eleventh. I almost sprinted with her to the ward, but not fast enough. The nurses wiped her clean, but she was so apologetic and grateful for my efforts that I hurried off, on the edge of tears. </p> <p>As the days ground on, the patients blurred into each other, but moments of their ordinary yet extraordinary heroism still stand out, and the hospital's wit, and the gentle humanity of the nurses. </p> <p>One of the sweetest things about being a porter was wheeling patients out on their way home. The nurses would pause from taking notes or checking drips or washing someone and look up and say: 'Goodbye, Joe', 'Take care, Joe', and they'd go on so much that poor oldJoe would be choking back the tears with pride and pleasure at having made so many friends. </p> <p>The nurses weren't saps, mind. I turned up at one ward without a wheelchair and the staff nurse snapped: 'Going to carry the patient on your back, are you?' Another nurse sneezed on me and I said: 'It's all right, I'll change my shirt.' She came back: 'It wasn't ironed, anyway, was it?' </p> <p>The NHS wards were packed solid but had an earthy companionship about them. 'Kinship is healing; we are physicians to each other,' Oliver Sacks wrote, and in that phrase he summed up the wonderful democratic spirit of the NHS. </p> <p>The private wards, on the twelfth floor of the north wing, were a little Switzerland: quieter, cleaner, much better decorated but colder, emptier. And the private patients locked away in their private rooms seemed lonelier and more miserable than the NHS ones. I can't recall a single joke heard in the private wards. </p> <p>And in the public? There are too many. I brought a 92-year-old back from X-ray. He could walk, just, and crept to the loo. I looked at his bedside table and saw a jug of Ribena and a copy of Loaded . Another patient, an 85-year-old, saw the magazine too. We both looked at the randy devil, tottering towards the loo: 'You would have thought, at his age ...' </p> <p>The lady, originally from County Cavan, had been waiting for an hour-and-a-half when I found her - and I had only been looking for a wheelchair. The nurses had called for a porter three times, and even the doctor had called down. A sweet Irishwoman, she wasn't the complaining type. I took her down to the lift and across to X-ray, but she was late. At the end of the day I found her again in transport, waiting some more. She leaned over to me and whispered, quietly: 'I've never had such a horrible day.' </p> <p>Through no fault of her own, she had missed some of her appointments and would have to come back.It was half past four, and she had been picked up at nine in the morning. Patients don't understand hi-tech medicine, but they do understand and resent hanging about. For nearly every patient I spoke to, the pointless waiting was the worst. But you could tell that no one with power in the hospital - still less the NHS - has addressed the simple, boring complaints: how long does a patient have to wait for a porter, the patient and porter for a lift, the patient to queue for the right doctor. For the doctors who run the hospitals, what matters is good medicine for the patients. For the patients who pay for the health service what matters is subtly different: not good medicine butgood treatment. They don't like being treated like cattle. </p> <p>I suspect that most patients, particularly the elderly, would rather die earlier than be kept waiting for hours while they are alive. In that simple but fundamental way, the NHS is misdirecting huge amounts of resources and money. </p> <p>The lack of money impacts on care and dignity in the wards. I turned up at a ward to wheel an old man down to X-ray in his bed. He was out of his bed, upright, saying: 'I'm all sticky.' He had soiled himself. To deal with that, the nurse would have had to stop doing her drugs round and wash his bottom - and that would knock on to his X-ray appointment, which he might miss completely. So she compromised: 'You'll be all right.' </p> <p>He made the journey in silence. That night, dog tired from walking around the hospital all day, I overheard the staff nurse talk to a younger one, called Sarah O'Connor: 'Can you do a double shift tomorrow?' She nodded, but made no attempt to conceal the look of exhaustion on her face. </p> <p>He was a very sick old man, his body covered in tubes and surrounded by bleeping machines, lost to consciousness. Two nurses and two doctors unhooked some of the tubes, plugged in others and we were off. In getting out of the door, the bed became trapped and a saline drip was punctured, causing a small fountain of clear fluid to erupt and shower the patient and us. </p> <p>The bed stopped, and the nurses and doctors plugged the leak. Then we were off again, this time with the porter at the front, steering the bed while walking backwards. It was a long journey, and a terrifying one. I didn't want him to die while I was steering his bed. </p> <p>We made it to the scanner. Half an hour later I pushed the bed back. The lift button for 'going up' on the first floor of east wing had not been working since Christmas, one of the porters had said. It still wasn't. So the patient, his tube and bleeps, the doctor, the two nurses and I had to go down to the ground floor, and then ping ourselves up again. </p> <p>For a full week being a porter I would have earned \u00a3151.74. At six on Friday night I handed out the X-rays to the wards. At the intensive care unit, the lights were down, conversation subdued. The sister was talking to a staff nurse: 'Have you asked any of them on tonight whether they can work tomorrow?' Oh, I've asked them all.'

      "bodyText": "My first patient was as frail as a porcelain teapot but, though in her nineties with thin wisps of hair plaited over her head, she was oddly girlish. As the newest hospital porter at St Thomas Hospital, I was to take her from 'transport', where the non-emergency ambulances and taxis come in, to the eye department, in a cumbersome wheelchair. As we pushed off, she said in the poshest rah-rah voice: 'Is this a BMW?' I played Q to her 007: 'All the usual accessories, 007...' And off we went. We got ten yards. To get from the lower ground floor on the Lambeth wing to the eye ward on the ground floor of the north wing is an easy run. If the lifts work. But they don't. A growing throng of walking patients, relatives and the wheelchair-bound waited. And waited. The lift came, we jammed in and spun round to the eye ward. En route, the old lady declared that for the Millennium she had drunk champagne washed down by mulled claret. They have fun, these old biddies. I went back to the lodge to get the next job, to be told: 'Find a wheelchair.' There weren't any. Half an hour later I decanted one old codger from a wheelchair into a normal chair - passing on the problem of moving him to some other poor soul - so that I could whizz back to transport. And wait for the lift going down. And then pick up, and wait for the lift. At 'Tommy's' none of the lift shafts are numbered for easy identification. None of them have a telephone number clearly marked on them, to report faults immediately. The non-medical side of the hospital doesn't just lack money, it lacks confidence, nous, imagination. New lifts are planned, and will happen in two years' time, but somehow that has meant they have almost given up repairing the old ones. Moving patients around is like walking through glue. The computer in the porter's lodge logs in red patients who have had to wait an especially long time. During the day the reds grew and grew, not because the porters were lazy or incompetent, but because the simplest things - getting a lift, finding a wheelchair - didn't work. That first morning another porter showed me around. We picked up an elderly Asian man. He was desperate to get back to his ward on the north wing, but when the lift came it was crowded out with a patient in a bed being moved by another porter. So we waited for the next lift. And waited. The porter and I did a bit of banter, making it easier to switch off the humanity in thewheelchair. Our patient was weeping, silently. The lift had taken so long, he had wet himself. When we got to the ward, the other porter didn't want to have to wipe off the urine, so he dumped the wheelchair by the patient's bed. A nurse ran after us: 'We're really busy, you've got to take that away.' We left it in the corridor, seat still covered in urine. 'You never clean up,' said the porter, 'unless it's a removal' (taking a dead body to the mortuary). Had it not been my first morning - I was new, unsure - I would have argued the point, and cleared it up myself. By the time another porter came along, the urine could have dried and the next patient would have had to sit in another man's piss. This was the only time I saw a porter - or anyone in the hospital - act without humanity. Back at transport... chaos. The controller, a poor wretch of a woman, had a room full of elderly and infirm patients staring miserably into space and, outside, a car park jammed with minicab drivers and non-emergency ambulances, all waiting to move the patients home. And the machine that made sense of it all had switched itself off. Five patients were queueing for her attention. The phone rang, and she barked: 'I've got a complete computer close-down. I've got a wait of at least two hours.' I was dispatched, along with a woman porter who had only been at the hospital four days, to move a patient from an intensive care unit to an ambulance, picking up the ambulance wheel-stretcher first. Neither of us knew where to go. As we traipsed around Accident and Emergency, a stretcher case came in, howling with pain, shoulder dislocated. His girlfriend followed him, carrying tell-tale roller blades. He howled again, a wolf in Lambeth. We found the stretcher, a complicated affair of folding metal struts and the other porter declared: 'I'm crash-trained.' But from her lack of confidence I was worried she didn't know how to work it. She wanted the ambulancemen to come with us, but they wanted a break, so we went to the ward on our own. The patient turned out to be a huge man. 'I'm crash-trained,' my companion told the ward doctor, then started wrestling with the stretcher as if it was some great aluminium crocodile. There was a huge crash as it collapsed to its flat state. So that was what 'crash-trained' meant. The patient lowered himself on to the flat stretcher, and we tried to heave it up. We couldn't do it. The patient got up, and then we had another go. This time it worked, and the patient made it to his ambulance, mysteriously still alive. Another day, another heroic patient. She was beautiful, dark-haired, in her mid-thirties, pale and frail, with an oxygen tube leading to her nostrils, and sitting in her wheelchair reading a fat novel by Vikram Seth. We talked books - her backing Seth, me plumping for Harry Potter - as we headed for the eleventh floor on the north wing. The lift was packed. The press of people was too much for her: 'I'm going to be sick.' Everyone decanted on the tenth, and she started coughing into her hands. The lift treacled up to the eleventh. I almost sprinted with her to the ward, but not fast enough. The nurses wiped her clean, but she was so apologetic and grateful for my efforts that I hurried off, on the edge of tears. As the days ground on, the patients blurred into each other, but moments of their ordinary yet extraordinary heroism still stand out, and the hospital's wit, and the gentle humanity of the nurses. One of the sweetest things about being a porter was wheeling patients out on their way home. The nurses would pause from taking notes or checking drips or washing someone and look up and say: 'Goodbye, Joe', 'Take care, Joe', and they'd go on so much that poor oldJoe would be choking back the tears with pride and pleasure at having made so many friends. The nurses weren't saps, mind. I turned up at one ward without a wheelchair and the staff nurse snapped: 'Going to carry the patient on your back, are you?' Another nurse sneezed on me and I said: 'It's all right, I'll change my shirt.' She came back: 'It wasn't ironed, anyway, was it?' The NHS wards were packed solid but had an earthy companionship about them. 'Kinship is healing; we are physicians to each other,' Oliver Sacks wrote, and in that phrase he summed up the wonderful democratic spirit of the NHS. The private wards, on the twelfth floor of the north wing, were a little Switzerland: quieter, cleaner, much better decorated but colder, emptier. And the private patients locked away in their private rooms seemed lonelier and more miserable than the NHS ones. I can't recall a single joke heard in the private wards. And in the public? There are too many. I brought a 92-year-old back from X-ray. He could walk, just, and crept to the loo. I looked at his bedside table and saw a jug of Ribena and a copy of Loaded . Another patient, an 85-year-old, saw the magazine too. We both looked at the randy devil, tottering towards the loo: 'You would have thought, at his age ...' The lady, originally from County Cavan, had been waiting for an hour-and-a-half when I found her - and I had only been looking for a wheelchair. The nurses had called for a porter three times, and even the doctor had called down. A sweet Irishwoman, she wasn't the complaining type. I took her down to the lift and across to X-ray, but she was late. At the end of the day I found her again in transport, waiting some more. She leaned over to me and whispered, quietly: 'I've never had such a horrible day.' Through no fault of her own, she had missed some of her appointments and would have to come back.It was half past four, and she had been picked up at nine in the morning. Patients don't understand hi-tech medicine, but they do understand and resent hanging about. For nearly every patient I spoke to, the pointless waiting was the worst. But you could tell that no one with power in the hospital - still less the NHS - has addressed the simple, boring complaints: how long does a patient have to wait for a porter, the patient and porter for a lift, the patient to queue for the right doctor. For the doctors who run the hospitals, what matters is good medicine for the patients. For the patients who pay for the health service what matters is subtly different: not good medicine butgood treatment. They don't like being treated like cattle. I suspect that most patients, particularly the elderly, would rather die earlier than be kept waiting for hours while they are alive. In that simple but fundamental way, the NHS is misdirecting huge amounts of resources and money. The lack of money impacts on care and dignity in the wards. I turned up at a ward to wheel an old man down to X-ray in his bed. He was out of his bed, upright, saying: 'I'm all sticky.' He had soiled himself. To deal with that, the nurse would have had to stop doing her drugs round and wash his bottom - and that would knock on to his X-ray appointment, which he might miss completely. So she compromised: 'You'll be all right.' He made the journey in silence. That night, dog tired from walking around the hospital all day, I overheard the staff nurse talk to a younger one, called Sarah O'Connor: 'Can you do a double shift tomorrow?' She nodded, but made no attempt to conceal the look of exhaustion on her face. He was a very sick old man, his body covered in tubes and surrounded by bleeping machines, lost to consciousness. Two nurses and two doctors unhooked some of the tubes, plugged in others and we were off. In getting out of the door, the bed became trapped and a saline drip was punctured, causing a small fountain of clear fluid to erupt and shower the patient and us. The bed stopped, and the nurses and doctors plugged the leak. Then we were off again, this time with the porter at the front, steering the bed while walking backwards. It was a long journey, and a terrifying one. I didn't want him to die while I was steering his bed. We made it to the scanner. Half an hour later I pushed the bed back. The lift button for 'going up' on the first floor of east wing had not been working since Christmas, one of the porters had said. It still wasn't. So the patient, his tube and bleeps, the doctor, the two nurses and I had to go down to the ground floor, and then ping ourselves up again. For a full week being a porter I would have earned \u00a3151.74. At six on Friday night I handed out the X-rays to the wards. At the intensive care unit, the lights were down, conversation subdued. The sister was talking to a staff nurse: 'Have you asked any of them on tonight whether they can work tomorrow?' Oh, I've asked them all.' The sister looked up, and the staff nurse shook her head and said: 'Definitely not.'

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/authors/author/0,5917,-78,00.html\">Books Unlimited author page</a></p> <p>Graham Greene was a novelist who understood the meaning and mechanics of mystery. He patrolled with impressive vigilance the perimeter fence of his privacy, while at the same time scattering tantalising clues about his life in the most unlikely places. An elusive public presence who relished controversy, he would have been delighted at the fuss that's currently surrounding Neil Jordan's brilliant film of The End of the Affair . </p> <p>Central to the brouhaha ('The truth behind the affair of the century' screamed one recent headline) is the rather second-hand revelation, by an improbable cast of relatives and commentators, that the 'C' (or, in American editions, Catherine) to whom The End of the Affair is dedicated was Catherine Walston, the beautiful and high-spirited American wife of the Labour peer Henry 'Harry' Walston. </p> <p>The role of Catherine Walston in Greene's life as his mistress and muse, roughly between 1946 and 1957, has been an open secret to Greene scholars and among his family and friends for many years. The release of this exceptional film, with its haunting, quasi-documentary recreation of London life during and after the Blitz (the period in which the novel is set), combined with the publication this spring of two Greene memoirs - Graham Greene on Capri by Shirley Hazzard and The Third Woman: The Secret Passion that Inspired the End of the Affair by William Cash - has stirred up a frenzy of interest in the 'autobiographical' nature of The End of the Affair , a complicated private story which demonstrates yet again how much stranger fact is than fiction. </p> <p>The novel, which contains the familiar Greene ingredients of sex, death, jealousy and God, describes an adulterous affair between a writer, Maurice Bendrix, and Sarah, the beautiful wife of an unsuspecting civil servant, Henry Miles 'one of misery's graduates'. When Bendrix is injured by a bomb during an air raid on London, Sarah, a Catholic, makes a deal with God: if He will save Bendrix, she will end the affair. Her unaccountable departure from his life is the mystery that Bendrix sets out to uncover, in the process reclaiming, or perhaps destroying, his lost mistress. </p> <p>In real life, Greene met Mrs Walston when, after her conversion to Roman Catholicism, she asked him, out of the blue, to be her godfather, a ceremony actually witnessed by Greene's wife Vivien. He was 42 and internationally celebrated for novels such as The Power and The Glory; she was 30, and the mother of six children. Greene subsequently arranged to meet his unknown god-daughter, fell in love and then sustained a long and passionate affair which was conducted with the full knowledge of all members of the Walston and Greene families. Harry Walston himself came to be utterly and helplessly complicit in the relationship. </p> <p>Greene, a Roman Catholic convert, was always tortured by the affair, and left in his personal papers a fascinating trail of clues as to the importance of the relationship in his life. Appropriately for a literary man, the key that unlocks the heart of Graham Greene lies in his private library (now preserved in Boston College). What is unique about Greene's library is the cornucopia of personal annotation, reflecting a long life of writing, politics, travel and sex, that's scattered along the margins and jotted on the endpapers of the books he was reading, books he left behind at his death in 1991. </p> <p>Greene's habit of private and personal commentary seems to have proved infectious to those close to him. It is the marginal annotations of Catherine Walston - 'C' - that provide the richest insights into perhaps the most secret of Greene's many love affairs. Thus, on the flyleaf of Elizabeth Bowen's history of Dublin's Shelbourne Hotel, we find Catherine recalling the beginning of their affair: 'To Graham in January 1952. It was at the Shelbourne almost five years ago - C'. Catherine's inscriptions in the books she gave her lover betray passion, devotion, and a sharp eye for mundane detail ('500 lire for Bananas!'). In a copy of Nothing , by his contemporary Henry Green, she writes 'In a thunderstorm on a train to Milan... June 13th 1950.' Added, in a different pen, are the words 'Catherine Greene - pen name for all novels.' </p> <p>Catherine Walston also seems to have acquired Greene's taste for subterfuge. In a copy of Wilde's De Profundis ('with love, Ritz December 2-4, 1949') she concludes a long dedication with this coded message: '1. PTMP 2.ILYB 3. SIMB 4.ROF 5. LLEOFE 6. ILY 7. IHGOOTB.' Other inscriptions recall ocean nights, Armagnac on villa patios, and opium smoked in the hotels of the East. In one of Greene's volumes of Kierkegaard there's a set of Scrabble scores for C and G. A dedication, dated Christmas, 1949, in The Life of Benvenuto Cellini gives a tantalising snapshot of their relationship: 'How happy I was today in Cambridge buying roller skates and drinking Irish whiskey...' </p> <p>In 1951 Catherine gave Greene a copy of The Face of Innocence by William Sansom 'as we tied up in Salerno on Elsewhere' - Alexander Korda's yacht - 'because there is nothing else to give you.' Six years later, after the publication of The Quiet American , and with Catherine's passion cooling, Greene began another relationship - with the Swedish actress Anita Bjork. On the endpapers of William Sansom's The Loving Eye Greene provides a window onto his emotional state of mind at the end of the affair with 'C'. In a fine, spidery but legible hand, he writes: 'Stockholm (Rather drunk after a solitary supper, waiting for a curtain to go down. Feb. 9, 1957)... Women like war, periods of waiting. Waiting while a car is late, a dentist's appointment, a curtain to fall. For everyone one has ever loved one has waited.' </p> <p>When I was shown this extraordinary library by Greene's executors in the months after his death I also spent several days reading through the correspondence that accompanied the books. It was clear that Greene had continued to correspond with 'C' until her death (from cancer) in 1978. A letter, annotated 'C's last letter' by Greene himself, and dated 18 May, runs as follows: </p> <p>'Dearest Graham, Your letter arrived and what a pleasure it was as I had heard nothing from you since you were here in November and I thought you were angry about something. And now today... you go to Capri. What happy times I had there with you and won't ever forget them from the day we walked through the gate for the first time with Bernardo... What a vast amount of pleasure you have given me playing Scrabble on the roof at Rosaio [Greene's villa] and teaching me to swim underwater at Ian Flemming's [sic] house; smoking opium at Ankor etc.... There has never been anyone in my life like you and thanks a lot.' </p> <p>But the most extraordinary letter, in which Greene's life and art are finally united, is the response Henry Walston wrote to his wife's lover acknowledging his condolences on the occasion of her death.

      "bodyText": "Books Unlimited author page Graham Greene was a novelist who understood the meaning and mechanics of mystery. He patrolled with impressive vigilance the perimeter fence of his privacy, while at the same time scattering tantalising clues about his life in the most unlikely places. An elusive public presence who relished controversy, he would have been delighted at the fuss that's currently surrounding Neil Jordan's brilliant film of The End of the Affair . Central to the brouhaha ('The truth behind the affair of the century' screamed one recent headline) is the rather second-hand revelation, by an improbable cast of relatives and commentators, that the 'C' (or, in American editions, Catherine) to whom The End of the Affair is dedicated was Catherine Walston, the beautiful and high-spirited American wife of the Labour peer Henry 'Harry' Walston. The role of Catherine Walston in Greene's life as his mistress and muse, roughly between 1946 and 1957, has been an open secret to Greene scholars and among his family and friends for many years. The release of this exceptional film, with its haunting, quasi-documentary recreation of London life during and after the Blitz (the period in which the novel is set), combined with the publication this spring of two Greene memoirs - Graham Greene on Capri by Shirley Hazzard and The Third Woman: The Secret Passion that Inspired the End of the Affair by William Cash - has stirred up a frenzy of interest in the 'autobiographical' nature of The End of the Affair , a complicated private story which demonstrates yet again how much stranger fact is than fiction. The novel, which contains the familiar Greene ingredients of sex, death, jealousy and God, describes an adulterous affair between a writer, Maurice Bendrix, and Sarah, the beautiful wife of an unsuspecting civil servant, Henry Miles 'one of misery's graduates'. When Bendrix is injured by a bomb during an air raid on London, Sarah, a Catholic, makes a deal with God: if He will save Bendrix, she will end the affair. Her unaccountable departure from his life is the mystery that Bendrix sets out to uncover, in the process reclaiming, or perhaps destroying, his lost mistress. In real life, Greene met Mrs Walston when, after her conversion to Roman Catholicism, she asked him, out of the blue, to be her godfather, a ceremony actually witnessed by Greene's wife Vivien. He was 42 and internationally celebrated for novels such as The Power and The Glory; she was 30, and the mother of six children. Greene subsequently arranged to meet his unknown god-daughter, fell in love and then sustained a long and passionate affair which was conducted with the full knowledge of all members of the Walston and Greene families. Harry Walston himself came to be utterly and helplessly complicit in the relationship. Greene, a Roman Catholic convert, was always tortured by the affair, and left in his personal papers a fascinating trail of clues as to the importance of the relationship in his life. Appropriately for a literary man, the key that unlocks the heart of Graham Greene lies in his private library (now preserved in Boston College). What is unique about Greene's library is the cornucopia of personal annotation, reflecting a long life of writing, politics, travel and sex, that's scattered along the margins and jotted on the endpapers of the books he was reading, books he left behind at his death in 1991. Greene's habit of private and personal commentary seems to have proved infectious to those close to him. It is the marginal annotations of Catherine Walston - 'C' - that provide the richest insights into perhaps the most secret of Greene's many love affairs. Thus, on the flyleaf of Elizabeth Bowen's history of Dublin's Shelbourne Hotel, we find Catherine recalling the beginning of their affair: 'To Graham in January 1952. It was at the Shelbourne almost five years ago - C'. Catherine's inscriptions in the books she gave her lover betray passion, devotion, and a sharp eye for mundane detail ('500 lire for Bananas!'). In a copy of Nothing , by his contemporary Henry Green, she writes 'In a thunderstorm on a train to Milan... June 13th 1950.' Added, in a different pen, are the words 'Catherine Greene - pen name for all novels.' Catherine Walston also seems to have acquired Greene's taste for subterfuge. In a copy of Wilde's De Profundis ('with love, Ritz December 2-4, 1949') she concludes a long dedication with this coded message: '1. PTMP 2.ILYB 3. SIMB 4.ROF 5. LLEOFE 6. ILY 7. IHGOOTB.' Other inscriptions recall ocean nights, Armagnac on villa patios, and opium smoked in the hotels of the East. In one of Greene's volumes of Kierkegaard there's a set of Scrabble scores for C and G. A dedication, dated Christmas, 1949, in The Life of Benvenuto Cellini gives a tantalising snapshot of their relationship: 'How happy I was today in Cambridge buying roller skates and drinking Irish whiskey...' In 1951 Catherine gave Greene a copy of The Face of Innocence by William Sansom 'as we tied up in Salerno on Elsewhere' - Alexander Korda's yacht - 'because there is nothing else to give you.' Six years later, after the publication of The Quiet American , and with Catherine's passion cooling, Greene began another relationship - with the Swedish actress Anita Bjork. On the endpapers of William Sansom's The Loving Eye Greene provides a window onto his emotional state of mind at the end of the affair with 'C'. In a fine, spidery but legible hand, he writes: 'Stockholm (Rather drunk after a solitary supper, waiting for a curtain to go down. Feb. 9, 1957)... Women like war, periods of waiting. Waiting while a car is late, a dentist's appointment, a curtain to fall. For everyone one has ever loved one has waited.' When I was shown this extraordinary library by Greene's executors in the months after his death I also spent several days reading through the correspondence that accompanied the books. It was clear that Greene had continued to correspond with 'C' until her death (from cancer) in 1978. A letter, annotated 'C's last letter' by Greene himself, and dated 18 May, runs as follows: 'Dearest Graham, Your letter arrived and what a pleasure it was as I had heard nothing from you since you were here in November and I thought you were angry about something. And now today... you go to Capri. What happy times I had there with you and won't ever forget them from the day we walked through the gate for the first time with Bernardo... What a vast amount of pleasure you have given me playing Scrabble on the roof at Rosaio [Greene's villa] and teaching me to swim underwater at Ian Flemming's [sic] house; smoking opium at Ankor etc.... There has never been anyone in my life like you and thanks a lot.' But the most extraordinary letter, in which Greene's life and art are finally united, is the response Henry Walston wrote to his wife's lover acknowledging his condolences on the occasion of her death. In heartbreakingly repressed sentiments that might have sprung from a Greene novel, and mimicking in the the most uncanny way the language of Henry Miles, the cuckolded husband in The End of the Affair , Walston wrote on 18 September 1978: 'Dear Graham, I've left your letter to the last to answer, because it's the most difficult. I've thought a lot, but I still don't really know what to say. You should not have remorse. Of course you caused pain. But who can honestly say he has gone through life without causing pain? And you gave joy too. One can't draw up a balance sheet of pluses and minuses. But you gave Catherine something (I don't know what) that no one else had given her.

PS I find I have omitted the ostensible purpose of this letter - to thank you for writing. I do.' Catherine Walston's final letter to Graham Green 'Dearest Graham, Your letter arrived and what a pleasure it was as I had heard nothing from you since you were here in November and I thought you were angry about something. And now today... you go to Capri. What happy times I had there with you and won't ever forget them from the day we walked through the gate for the first time with Bernardo... What a vast amount of pleasure you have given me playing Scrabble on the roof at Rosaio [Greene's villa] and teaching me to swim underwater at Ian Flemming's [sic] house; smoking opium at Ankor etc... There has never been anyone in my life like you.' The diary entry made a week before her death by Sarah Miles, the Catherine Walston character in The End of the Affair 'I'm not at peace any more. I just want him like I used to in the old days. I want to be eating sandwiches with him. I want to be drinking with him in a bar. I'm tired and I don't want any more pain. I want Maurice. I want ordinary corrupt human love. Dear God, you know I want to want Your pain but I don't want it now.

      "body": "<p>There's a scene roughly two-thirds of the way through Paul Thomas Anderson's new movie, Magnolia, that's so simple and so daring no one quite knows how to take it. Some might laugh. Some might cry. Some might simply yawn and wish he'd just get on with it. To explain it would take away the surprise, but it's enough to say that it's one of those moments that makes the hairs on the back of your neck quiver like mini radar sensors. </p> <p>In the cinema, it's a feeling you only get at certain times, a feeling that tells you you're seeing something important, something that's happening now, and that you're right there in the thick of it: the history books haven't been written yet, the video release is still six months away and, right now, that's all that matters. Ironically, this side of the moviegoing experience has been written out of history. In much the same way that our sex, our drugs and our rock 'n' roll are apparently no longer a patch on what they used to be, movies can no longer surprise. </p> <p>Quentin Tarantino once raved to Bertolucci about how much he loved the work of Jean-Luc Godard. Bertolucci simply smiled and assured the boy wonder, with matching enthusiasm, that he couldn't know how exciting it was to appreciate Godard at the height of his Sixties mystique. It's this knowing world-weariness that underpins Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, Peter Biskind's masterful insight into the rise of the Movie Brats (Spielberg, Lucas, Scorsese et al). </p> <p>Despite the book's undoubted authority, there's still a dubious nostalgia that tells us emphatically that 'the 13 years between Bonnie and Clyde in 1967 and Heaven's Gate in 1980 marked the last time it was really exciting to make movies in Hollywood, the last time people could be consistently proud of the movies they made, the last time the community as a whole encouraged good work, the last time there was an audience that could sustain it'. </p> <p>Biskind's use of the word 'last' is noticeably ambiguous. According to a recent report in Variety, admissions at the American box-office in 1999 rose by 4 per cent to their highest level in recent history. Leaving aside the contentious issue of grosses, this means almost 1.5 billion tickets were sold last year alone. Admittedly, the bulk of films reaching beyond the $100 million mark, with the notable exception of The Blair Witch Project, are star vehicles and studio blockbusters, but the upshot of this boom in moviegoing seems to be having an unusual impact on the general audience's tastes. </p> <p>The new sophistication is reflected in the films chosen recently by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association in their nominations for the annual Golden Globe awards. Normally, these can be po-faced, worthy affairs, but the choices this year show a resurgence of interest in the points that made filmmaking so vital in Biskind's heyday. </p> <p>As an indication, take the five films nominated for Best Picture. At the head of the list, and currently odds-on favourite, is American Beauty, a darkly comic tale of mid-life crisis played out in the denial zone of suburban America. Its director, British theatre director Sam Mendes, has no Hollywood track record, coming directly from Broadway hits with Cabaret and The Blue Room. </p> <p>Its star, Kevin Spacey, is already Hollywood's resident nearly man; with his pudgy face and coy smile, Spacey is perhaps the anti-Tom Hanks, a baggage-free actor whose ordinariness can be eerily ambiguous - which makes his Best Actor buzz all the more noteworthy and makes it all the more ironic that this film should be released by Spielberg's DreamWorks SKG. </p> <p>Sometimes overlooked among the rich pickings that American Beauty has to offer (including the Best Actress-tipped Annette Bening as Spacey's shallow, hectoring wife) is Alan Ball's wonderful, biting screenplay. In fact, it seems that after a decade of director-driven movies, the pendulum is swinging back towards the writer. Proof of this is Neil Jordan's acclaimed The End Of The Affair, based on Graham Greene's novel, which tells a story of infidelity and sexual intrigue in war-torn London. </p> <p>Literary adaptations have been out of favour, so it's intriguing to see that the Globes have adopted it, along with Anthony Minghella's adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's The Talented Mr Ripley. A languid, highbrow crime thriller, it stars the usually bovine Matt Damon in the untypically subtle title role, playing a chameleonic New York bellboy sent to Italy to persuade the son of a powerful shipping magnate to return home. </p> <p>Climaxing in the canals of Venice, The Talented Mr Ripley boasts a promising cast of photogenic young stars but slyly wrongfoots its audience's expectations. Sympathetically directed by Minghella, Damon's performance is not at all a showboating turn tilted for the teenage market, but an expressly adult and nuanced portrayal of a gawky, repressed misfit, ashamed of his working-class roots and unable to deal with his needy, almost adolescent homosexuality. </p> <p>The opposite is true of Al Pacino, whose role in Michael Mann's The Insider as a crusading television producer is exactly the showcase piece we've come to expect from the man who didn't win an Oscar until the lame Scent Of A Woman. But Pacino didn 't make the Globes' shortlist as Best Actor - that honour went to his co-star, Russell Crowe, who plays Jeffrey Wigand, the man who blew the whistle on the inner workings of the US tobacco industry. Crowe's performance is already being hailed as a masterpiece of understatement, and the film itself is being compared to All The President's Men, the quintessential Seventies' Hollywood movie and a far cry from the high-tech pizzazz of his 1995 crime thriller Heat or the bombast of Last Of The Mohicans (1992). </p> <p>Indeed, it's a measure of Mann's success that the script he co-wrote with Eric Roth has actually been praised as taut and economic - despite a running time of some three hours. </p> <p>The fifth movie vying for a prestigious Golden Globe is Norman Jewison's The Hurricane, starring Denzel Washington as boxer Rubin Carter, who spent 20 years in jail for a murder he did not commit. Jewison hasn't been this close to mainstream success in some years; aside from a close shave with Best Picture for Moonstruck in 1987, his real moment of glory came 20 years earlier with In The Heat Of The Night. </p> <p>The Hurricane is an examination of prejudice and injustice, suggesting a boredom with escapist genre entertainment and a wish to get back to making movies that tell us some thing about our society. These, however, are just the frontrunners. Honoured with nominations in the Globes' sub-categories are films such as Spike Jonze's surreal Being John Malkovich, about a puppeteer who finds a gateway into the actor's brain, or Kimberly Peirce's Boys Don't Cry which hark back to the glory years of the late Sixties and early Seventies when screwball ideas and personal passions could be indulged. </p> <p>An incredibly assured debut, the latter stars newcomer Hilary Swank, whose moving portrayal of Teena Brandon, a sexually confused midwestern runaway posing as a boy, is a fiercely competitive Oscar tip. And Tom Cruise, who proved such a damp squib in Eyes Wide Shut, may find himself more likely to be rewarded with a Supporting Actor award for his performance in Magnolia, a labyrinthine tale of chance and coincidence focusing on a dying man's last night.

      "body": "<p>Like Sir Francis Drake with his bowls, Ashley Judd is reluctant to let a mere interview interrupt the game she's playing with a friend. Judd is trying to guess the name of a famous dead female whose surname begins with 'M'. 'Margaret Mead?' she suggests. Her friend looks blank. 'Author of A Coming Of Age In Samoa?'</p> <p>The friend is none the wiser, but the message has reached the journalist lurking in the doorway of the Dorchester suite that Judd is no vacuous starlet: she knows her dead, discredited anthropologists. There's something else that has to happen before we can talk: someone has to be dispatched for vitamin C tablets. London's virulence has alarmed Ashley Judd, and she has no intention of catching our flu. </p> <p>Judd is in a position to have things her way. The thriller she's here to promote - Double Jeopardy - has lifted her on to the A-list. It's not a great film, and far from Judd's best performance, but it did surprisingly well in the States. Top billing actually goes to Tommy Lee Jones, but he doesn't turn up until 35 minutes in, whereas the whole film is about Judd's character.</p> <p>She plays a wealthy wife and mother who wakes up to find that she has apparently murdered her (missing) husband. Jones is the parole officer who eventually - stop me if you think you've heard this one before - comes to understand that she was framed. By mainstream Hollywood standards it's a terrific part for a young actress. She gets to wear prison overalls or tracksuit bottoms for most of the film, crash cars, shoot guns and still be obsessively maternal. She describes it as 'a really juicy role in a fun commercial movie'.</p> <p>If you know one fact about Judd, it is probably that her mother Naomi and sister Wynonna made up the massively successful country act The Judds; or that she used to go out with Michael Bolton, he of the unspeakable hair. But she's carved out what looks like the perfect Hollywood career plan. She certainly has a steely sense of being in control, even when her name is connected with every big movie in development.</p> <p>'I've never spread myself too thin. I've certainly never attached myself to too many projects and that's not going to change now. And although my name may be mentioned in association with various parts, it's usually erroneous.'</p> <p>Surely you're not going to claim you only go for good scripts? Everyone says that, but there are plenty of films with lousy scripts getting made.</p> <p>'People have different definitions of what comprises good. There are a lot of things I'm not interested in and then I find that so-and-so is dying to play the part. A really good example of a movie that was so successful is While You Were Sleeping. Sandy [Sandra Bullock] really wanted to do that and I didn't even want to meet the producers. Who's the fool? Nobody. Because she did what was right for her and I did what was right for me.'</p> <p>Judd grabbed people's attention with only her second film, Ruby In Paradise (1993). She'd been in LA for three years, doing bits and pieces of TV, but this quiet, thoughtful indie movie gave her the perfect opportunity to show you could build a film around her. And it taught her a vital acting lesson. 'I learnt that doing nothing does come across.' It was something she used for small but arresting parts in Smoke and particularly Heat.</p> <p>'Michael Mann is a great film-maker,' she says with awe, 'Absolutely outstanding. Incredibly thorough. Any actor with a lick of sense would do a throwaway line and walk-on part just to pass through his greatness.'</p> <p>She did wifey roles in commercial hits such as A Time To Kill (1996). In the same year she starred in - and got great reviews for - John McNaughton's hugely bleak Normal Life. And she turned up regularly in the gossip columns. (These days, she has a strict veto on questions about her relationships).</p> <p>In 1997 she appeared in Kiss The Girls. Two parts The Silence Of The Lambs, one part Seven, the film ended up weighed down by clich\u00e9s but Judd got to play a kick-boxing girl who survives the attacks of a serial killer. She was cast opposite Morgan Freeman, which never seems to do anyone's career any harm. It showed she could do action, help carry a commercial movie and work well with older men. She was perfectly set up for Double Jeopardy, a $4 million-and-rising wage packet - and the ability to order people out to buy vitamin tablets. </p> <p>She was born in LA in 1968. Her father left her mother four years later. When she was a small child she moved frequently, sometimes living with her father and sometimes with her mother. Living on the road was perfect training for the itinerant life of an actor. 'It has helped, believe me. There's no doubt I can go in commando style and convert something into a decent and nourishing living space and then walk away from it three months later.'</p> <p>Her childhood is part of country music legend, the story of how Naomi Judd heroically brought up little Wynonna and Ashley on no money at all. They were so poor, the story goes, they had to make their own soap. The way Ashley tells it now the story is a little different.</p> <p>'There's a college in a very small town in Kentucky called Beria,' Judd explains, 'It's an Appalachian college and and your family must be living well under the government level of poverty for you to go there. The kids earn their way through school by doing Appalachian crafts. There's beautiful handmade cherry furniture and the school runs a tavern and they make soap. We lived near Beria: and my mom was very interested in things like that. And so making soap was continuing a really neat part of that heritage. But when my mother and my sister were trying to get a singing career started in Nashville there was a morning programme on which they appeared and the guy that did it could never get their name right, so he called them the Soap Sisters. And so this story takes off...'</p> <p>However poor they might have once been, Naomi and Wynonna made it big in country music and Ashley ended up at the University of Kentucky, where she studied French and presumably amplified her wide reading and impressively broad vocabulary. She also helped organise a protest when a senior university official was overheard using the word 'nigger'. </p> <p>She briefly considered doing voluntary work in the Third World but instead drove off to Hollywood. She talks a lot about being Southern, and she lives on a farm in Tennessee - but she doesn't have a Southern accent, and she's clearly cosmopolitan and business-like. She has that combination of undisguised ambition and new-age aura that seems to slot naturally together for famous American women. </p> <p>She talks about 'modes of gratefulness'. And she explains her vegetarianism thus: 'I believe that you eat the animals' fear.'</p> <p>Their fear?</p> <p>'When they are going to be slaughtered and they hear the other animals being slaughtered and the chemicals released by the fight-or-flight response - among many, many things. Universally it's recommended that you eat lower on the food chain, because the higher on the food chain you eat, you're consuming not only that animal but everything it has eaten. I'm not, hopefully, an obnoxious vegetarian - I can prepare meat in my home for people who do eat it - traditional Southern things like bacon or sausage to go with biscuits and grits in the morning. Or fried chicken. If I didn't have those things as cultural staples of my growing up, I wouldn't even have that. But I find myself wanting to witness about it more, to teach by example.'</p> <p>Here's something that's firmly in Judd's favour: she knows she's got it made: 'When I wake up I think \"Oh my gosh, I really have everything I could possibly want or need in this life\". Acting is something that, at the end of the year, I haven't done enough of. Maybe that's why some people make too many movies. The time spent in the actual performance is incredibly brief compared to the time it takes to fly to location - you spent more time getting there than the running time of the movie!</p> <p>'Maybe that's why I've got increasingly interested in the creative aspects of the movie - design, costume, shot selection...'</p> <p>Sounds very much like she wants to direct.</p> <p>'Some day,' she says.</p> <p>Then she piles four huge vitamin C tablets into a glass.

It was not clear whether the claim of heavy rebel casualties was just the latest strike in a continuing propaganda war. A Chechen rebel commander retorted that his men had slaughtered 28 Russian soldiers in the capital early yesterday. Neither claim could be verified. It has been a nasty week for Russia's generals. After preening themselves over the praise meted out by Yeltsin in his final days - that Russia's army had conducted a 'flawless' campaign in Chechnya - the high command was in for a rude shock. Seizing their moment carefully, Chechnya's rebels suddenly rounded on their attackers and orchestrated lightning raids on several strategically crucial Russian-held towns. The military could not disguise its humiliation, conceding that it had suffered the worst losses of the campaign so far. Russia had suffered serious setbacks already in the course of this war, but managed to conceal the extent of the problems from the electorate. Last week Russia's independent papers splashed pictures of gruesomely wounded Russian soldiers on their front pages for the first time, and even pro-government publications began to question the wisdom of the war. As troops scrambled to regain control, military spin doctors sought to retrieve the situation before popular opinion had a chance to crystallise against acting president Vladimir Putin's fundamental project - the 'elimination of terrorists' in Chechnya, the campaign on which his entire future career is based. Desperation pushed the military to adopt astonishingly harsh measures against the civilian population - with the region's senior commander Colonel-General Victor Kazantsev announcing that the key mistake his men had made was the rather unlikely error of being excessively 'tender-hearted', and that such soft ness was to be eliminated immediately. In this vein he announced that Chechen males - including children as young as 11 - were henceforth to be regarded automatically as rebels. Further evidence of the military's disarray was displayed last week in the undignified accusations of blame flung between the different arms of the Russian forces. Kazantsev accused the Interior Ministry troops, whose job it was to protect the conquered territory, of failing to perform their jobs correctly. Preferring to sweep the disaster under the carpet, Defence Minister Igor Sergeyev announced that the rebels' advance should not be seen as a Russian failure. Meanwhile the Kremlin - determined to bolster wavering popular support for the war - issued a video which it claimed proved that militants in the separatist region masterminded the terrorist bombings across Russia last autumn that killed almost 300. The video appeared to be designed to stamp out rumours that the government itself orchestrated the attacks, in an attempt to stoke up nationalist support. Military officials have been forced to acknowledge that rebels are still hiding inside areas supposed to be under Russian control and have admitted that further counter-attacks are eminently possible. The most surprising element of last week's events is that the Russian generals failed so dismally to prepare for the possibility of these counter-attacks. As the officers responsible face uncomfortable recriminations, defence analysts have been expressing amazement that the army failed to learn two crucial lessons from its 1994-96 war with Chechnya. The first was that wresting the Chechen capital Grozny from the rebels would be a very bitter and prolonged operation. The second was to have forgotten the effective ness of the rebels' favourite tactic - swift but devastating raids into Russian-held territory. During the last war, Russia won most of Chechnya before promptly losing it again, as a result of the rebels' persistence under pressure. Russia also began the conflict on the edge of winter, with fog and mist making it easy for rebels to sneak through Russian lines. Alexei Malashenko, of the Carnegie Institute in Moscow, said: 'Russian generals had begun to believe that they were capable of anything they wanted to do on Chechen territory. That was a bad mistake.' By the beginning of this year, the army had moved its \u00e9lite forces to Grozny, leaving poorly trained conscript brigades to look after the rear. These demoralised young fighters represent the Russian army's main weak spot. Anatol Lieven of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, and author of a book on Russia's last war with Chechnya, said: 'Often the soldiers simply don't want to fight, they huddle behind barbed wire rather than going out on patrol especially in the fog or at night. 'If you are a young conscript who has been beaten by older soldiers for the last year, if you are aware that the senior officers are selling off your weapons on the black market and stealing your pay, you're likely to feel rather demotivated.' The military dismissed unofficial reports of soaring casualties as 'lies' but the Soldiers' Mothers Committee, a Moscow pressure group which campaigns for the rights of conscripts, insisted that the true figure was at least double and possibly four times the 700-odd dead admitted by officials. Yet, despite these mistakes, there is little doubt that Russia is capable of defeating the rebels. Lieven said: 'The Russians have unlimited ammunition. If they keep their nerve and continue to hammer away, they will win.'",

The company launched a mass-mailing campaign, sending out 250 million free software disks to consumers. By the middle of 1994, AOL had a million users. </p> <p>Soon it was struggling to match demand, and acquired the nickname 'America On Hold'. Users started switching to other, cheaper, providers. So desperate was AOL to stop the exodus that, according to Swisher, it considered launching an adult channel. The offer of refunds to disgruntled users helped avert potential lawsuits. </p> <p>In October 1996, when AOL had more than 6 million users, the company's fortunes really started to change.

Enough moving pictures and words to last a thousand lifetimes. </p> <p>This is the fantasy of total control, the dream of domination, that has allowed the world's largest ever merger last week, the coming-together of Time Warner, with its world news from CNN, its 5,700 films, its Time publishing empire, and 120 million magazine readers, its TV shows such as Friends and ER and its cable channels; and America Online, the world's biggest Internet provider. </p> <p>To understand quite what these corporate giants are up to, you need to remember that super-fast cable links will make what we now call the Internet seem as limited as the first hand-cranked telephones now look in the world of mobile telephony. Before long, you will not only be able to carry the Internet around with you on handsets, but your home will be able to receive huge quantities of films and words through high-speed cable or broadband links, 24 hours a day. There will be no need to hook up, no wait, no dial tone. </p> <p>Thus, within days of the new century beginning, some of the most familiar cultural divisions of the twentieth century already look as if they are starting to blur, to fuzz at the edges. Telephone companies? Television? Radio networks? News companies? Entertainment companies? The Internet itself, as a separate thing? All these categories are swimming into one another through the logic of corporate mergers and the tech nologies of voice recognition, broadband, faster cable and webcasting. </p> <p>Before you feel your head swim, recall that this is therefore, above all, a political matter. The super-company will be able, in theory, to offer you a kind of complete media bubble, an all-in-one service that anticipates your preferences and gives you what you want, when you want it. Or what you think you want. For this is extraordinary power and, if this capitalist fantasy was realised, it would only start with news and entertainment. Your provider of laughter and of glimpses at the outside world would soon become your banker, or a good friend of your banker. Its advertisers would be your suppliers. </p> <p>Its world-view would, no doubt, look varied - even the Murdoch empire, running from Bart Simpson to William Rees-Mogg, is pretty eclectic in style. For the new super-company, there would be no aggressive ban on other sources of infotainment. There would be no need. Its perpetual household bubble would be just thick enough to make it a bother to go elsewhere. The convenience of a single huge supplier, a hypermarket of the imagination, and the cross-promotion that allows, would keep rivals out, huddled in the obscure shacks on the wrong side of the tracks. AOL's Steve Case has virtually admitted as much. </p> <p>Nor should we assume that governments would be alarmed by the emergence of the media/entertainment/commerce super-company. In some ways, politicians would like them for making life simpler. They would be easier to cut deals with. Their products would be sanitised and their political views would be predictable. Already, AOL faces a vociferous hostile alliance (see <a href=\"http://www.aolsucks.org\">www.aolsucks.org</a> for instance) accusing it of censorship, a row that became white-hot last September when the company kicked the American Civil Liberties Union off its sites. The more the Net is in the hands of a few giant outfits, the less anarchy, the more control, the easier for political establishments everywhere. </p> <p>This, of course, is the utter negative of the world the Internet pioneers hoped to create, as unlike the original vision as Microsoft's Seattle is unlike the simple farming economy the first Western settlers dreamed of as they jolted down the Oregon Trail. The Net offered, and still offers, the ideal of individual anti-corporate power, a world-wide wash of free information, serendipity and random friendship. </p> <p>So it is hardly surprising that, after the corporate American back-slapping, thinking America quickly signalled alarm. Consumer groups started talking of 'a giant media and Internet dictatorship'. Writing for the Internet magazine Salon , the former Netscape employee Jamie Zawinski argued that 'this should worry people in the same way and for the same reasons that the sheer size of the media corporations should worry them. This kind of vertical integration makes it harder for the public to hear anything but the corporate party line...' </p> <p>And Mark Crispin Miller, of New York University, argued bitterly: 'Conflict of interest is now so widespread that the phrase almost has no meaning any longer. AOL will now have every reason to cram its offerings with Time Warner product. AOL will tend to guide us toward sites that feature the latest Warner Brothers release, the TV shows and the movies that Warner Brothers produces...' And another commentator chipped in that 'content may be king, but access to the home is king-maker'. </p> <p>Some readers may be wondering by now how much all this affects them - a column about US corporate mergers attacked by US liberal critics. First, we live in an Atlantic culture. Second, when it comes to the really powerful media influences, Britain's monopoly laws are the monopoly laws that Washington chooses. Here, we have comparatively tiny media companies struggling to merge, to grow from minnows to little trout. Even the BBC is small compared to the killer-pike breeding on Wall Street. </p> <p>But this is not an inevitable 'force of history' event. Every time, so far, that some government, group or company has dreamed of total control, and every time thinkers have wailed that this is The Future, then The Future has fallen apart. This time, a day after ecstatically hailing the AOL-Time Warner merger as 'a marriage made in heaven', Wall Street stripped $30 billion off the companies' joint value - about a seventh of their value, which is some going for a 24-hour second thought. Why? Partly because companies all have their own cultures, and Time Warner is already a ramshackle empire. Case looked like a tubby, cold-eyed predator in a feeding frenzy as he embraced Gerald Levin of Time Warner. The financial world concurs that, in reality, smaller, junior AOL is devouring the more senior company. But this may be a hard meal to digest: corporate history is littered with takeovers that failed to deliver. </p> <p>Nor have either governments or consumers been quite as easy to manipulate as the control fantasists hoped. Microsoft, which had seemed too big for the ordinary rules, has been stopped in its tracks by government lawyers. Monsanto has been gutted by the consumer revolt across Europe. Murdoch's notorious boast that British national newspapers would soon be reduced to just three titles - the Times, the Daily Mail and the Sun - looks, today, merely quaint. </p> <p>Keeping the Internet open and free matters. The more easy, star-struck capital, and converging technologies allow super-companies to emerge, the more we need democracy to fight for variety and fair markets. And we need it for one reason above all - the single glaring omission in this article so far, the essence without which all the excitement about share prices, mergers, corporate strategy and technological innovation means nothing at all: content. We need variety and danger to get a better, livelier social conversation - in short, to make ourselves more intelligent. </p> <p>We can produce faster, brighter, neater, cheaper ways of delivering pictures and words. But outside science we cannot, it seems, produce any great new stories, works of musical or dramatic genius, fresh social or political thinking or unexpected insights. Our thinking and story-telling are getting as grey and slow as our technology is fast. And so it will stay as long as the corporate giants lumber across our dreams.</p>",

And we need it for one reason above all - the single glaring omission in this article so far, the essence without which all the excitement about share prices, mergers, corporate strategy and technological innovation means nothing at all: content. We need variety and danger to get a better, livelier social conversation - in short, to make ourselves more intelligent. We can produce faster, brighter, neater, cheaper ways of delivering pictures and words. But outside science we cannot, it seems, produce any great new stories, works of musical or dramatic genius, fresh social or political thinking or unexpected insights. Our thinking and story-telling are getting as grey and slow as our technology is fast. And so it will stay as long as the corporate giants lumber across our dreams.",

      "body": "<p>Confidence is at the heart of economic policy. Once forfeited, it is hard to regain. The Labour Party took almost 20 years to recover from its travails of the 1970s; and the Conservatives finally lost the confidence of a sorely tried nation on Black Wednesday 16 September 1992. </p> <p>The economics of Roosevelt and Keynes were essentially aimed at restoring the confidence and 'animal spirits' of businessmen whose nerves had been badly shattered by the post-1929 Depression (when output in the US fell by a third). </p> <p>During the golden age of the 1950s, there was a lot of confidence around in the competence of economic policy-makers; and more and more analysts are now writing as if we have returned, via low inflation and the technological revolution associated with computers and the Internet, to that golden age. </p> <p>Someone who has reflected as much as anyone on the precise significance in economic history of the revolution in information technology is Alan Greenspan, chairman of US Federal Reserve. Although Greenspan's speeches are usually reported for their relevance to interest rate policy, his collected works are more those of a pragmatic economic historian who was taught in his youth to beware the four words: 'This time it's different'. </p> <p>In his more recent speeches, Greenspan has given more weight to the view that the US has indeed been experiencing some kind of productivity miracle. </p> <p>But last week, against a background of the US valuing high-technology stocks at on average 200 times their annual earnings, Greenspan said it was not yet clear whether we were witnessing 'a once in a century acceleration of innovation', or 'one of the many euphoric speculative bubbles that have dotted human history' - or elements of both. </p> <p>There is no lack of confidence in Greenspan. Indeed, if anything, the US adminis tration and the financial markets are over-confident, imbuing him with magical powers. People may have forgotten, but a number of Greenspan's predecessors, including Paul Volcker, were also regarded as so important to business, consumer and market confidence as to be irreplaceable. President Clinton has decided that Greenspan will be replaced by Greenspan. </p> <p>One of the great things about Greenspan is that, unlike US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, he does not radiate over-confidence. He is cautious. He listens, and he studies every available statistic. This darling of a Democratic administration is in fact very right wing, even by US standards. He comes from a school that would not have been as generous as he in erring on the side of employment rather than deflation. </p> <p>Of course, he and his committee are obliged by law to aim at maximum employment. This is unlike the brief of the European Central Bank or the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee. If the Fed had been subject to the MPC's 2.5 per cent inflation target, it would have missed that target in 10 of the past 12 years. </p> <p>There is plenty of scope in the Fed's brief for encouraging growth, and Greenspan has taken full advantage of that. But all the best aspects of the American economic system have contributed to its recent strong performance. To read some of his adulators, you would think Greenspan was personally responsible for the innovation associated with the Internet and e-commerce. </p> <p>Nevertheless, his growth-orientated policies, and his correct reading of the disinflationary effect of technology and global competition, have certainly helped. The Fed was also quicker than other central banks to spot the disinflationary effect of the Asian crisis. </p> <p>The question in the US is how long confidence can last before it becomes over-confidence, and pride is followed by a fall. Even in the golden age of the 1950s, policymakers had to beware of macro-economic imbalances. It is not just the stock market that is issuing warnings in the US. The country's trade and current account deficit is spiralling out of control, and at some stage there is likely to be a classic reaction. </p> <p>John Llewellyn of Lehman Brothers asked last week: 'What does it take to slow down a large, fast-growing, confident economy?' His answer: 'Intervention from outside will be necessary.' </p> <p>In other words, if confidence in Greenspan is to be retained, the great man may have to stop talking and start acting. </p> <p>By contrast, the European Central Bank is still trying to gain a reputation for competence, and to build up the kind of public confidence the Fed enjoys. Relatively low European interest rates are helping a Euroland economy that still lags some years behind the US in the Grand Recovery Stakes. </p> <p>There is something for everyone in the latest musings from the ECB - for the hawks, for the doves and for the sparrows sitting on the fence. The president of the ECB, Wim Duisenberg, has recently been interpreted as 'talking tough' about interest rates. But Duisenberg could learn a few lessons from Greenspan's recent years. Confidence in the recovery of the core German economy is still fragile, and does not need to be knocked on the head. </p> <p>Which brings us, last but not least, to that non-Euroland known as the UK. Here Chancellor Gordon Brown, for all the carpings from his friendly critics, has gained a reputation for great competence. Stocks in 'G Brown plc' have been rising and rising. The public seems to have enormous confidence in him. </p> <p>There is also a lot of confidence in the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee, despite the recent little local difficulty between the 'insiders' and 'outsiders'. </p> <p>But I wonder how long this confidence will last. 'We were popular when rates went down. But you watch what happens as they go up,' said one Bank man not long ago. </p> <p>The general expectation is that, following last week's widely expected quarter-point rise (to 5.75 per cent), UK rates are going to go up and up. The pound is already at absurdly high levels, and it is a fantasy to believe that the British economy has happily adjusted to this high exchange rate.

      "bodyText": "Confidence is at the heart of economic policy. Once forfeited, it is hard to regain. The Labour Party took almost 20 years to recover from its travails of the 1970s; and the Conservatives finally lost the confidence of a sorely tried nation on Black Wednesday 16 September 1992. The economics of Roosevelt and Keynes were essentially aimed at restoring the confidence and 'animal spirits' of businessmen whose nerves had been badly shattered by the post-1929 Depression (when output in the US fell by a third). During the golden age of the 1950s, there was a lot of confidence around in the competence of economic policy-makers; and more and more analysts are now writing as if we have returned, via low inflation and the technological revolution associated with computers and the Internet, to that golden age. Someone who has reflected as much as anyone on the precise significance in economic history of the revolution in information technology is Alan Greenspan, chairman of US Federal Reserve. Although Greenspan's speeches are usually reported for their relevance to interest rate policy, his collected works are more those of a pragmatic economic historian who was taught in his youth to beware the four words: 'This time it's different'. In his more recent speeches, Greenspan has given more weight to the view that the US has indeed been experiencing some kind of productivity miracle. But last week, against a background of the US valuing high-technology stocks at on average 200 times their annual earnings, Greenspan said it was not yet clear whether we were witnessing 'a once in a century acceleration of innovation', or 'one of the many euphoric speculative bubbles that have dotted human history' - or elements of both. There is no lack of confidence in Greenspan. Indeed, if anything, the US adminis tration and the financial markets are over-confident, imbuing him with magical powers. People may have forgotten, but a number of Greenspan's predecessors, including Paul Volcker, were also regarded as so important to business, consumer and market confidence as to be irreplaceable. President Clinton has decided that Greenspan will be replaced by Greenspan. One of the great things about Greenspan is that, unlike US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, he does not radiate over-confidence. He is cautious. He listens, and he studies every available statistic. This darling of a Democratic administration is in fact very right wing, even by US standards. He comes from a school that would not have been as generous as he in erring on the side of employment rather than deflation. Of course, he and his committee are obliged by law to aim at maximum employment. This is unlike the brief of the European Central Bank or the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee. If the Fed had been subject to the MPC's 2.5 per cent inflation target, it would have missed that target in 10 of the past 12 years. There is plenty of scope in the Fed's brief for encouraging growth, and Greenspan has taken full advantage of that. But all the best aspects of the American economic system have contributed to its recent strong performance. To read some of his adulators, you would think Greenspan was personally responsible for the innovation associated with the Internet and e-commerce. Nevertheless, his growth-orientated policies, and his correct reading of the disinflationary effect of technology and global competition, have certainly helped. The Fed was also quicker than other central banks to spot the disinflationary effect of the Asian crisis. The question in the US is how long confidence can last before it becomes over-confidence, and pride is followed by a fall. Even in the golden age of the 1950s, policymakers had to beware of macro-economic imbalances. It is not just the stock market that is issuing warnings in the US. The country's trade and current account deficit is spiralling out of control, and at some stage there is likely to be a classic reaction. John Llewellyn of Lehman Brothers asked last week: 'What does it take to slow down a large, fast-growing, confident economy?' His answer: 'Intervention from outside will be necessary.' In other words, if confidence in Greenspan is to be retained, the great man may have to stop talking and start acting. By contrast, the European Central Bank is still trying to gain a reputation for competence, and to build up the kind of public confidence the Fed enjoys. Relatively low European interest rates are helping a Euroland economy that still lags some years behind the US in the Grand Recovery Stakes. There is something for everyone in the latest musings from the ECB - for the hawks, for the doves and for the sparrows sitting on the fence. The president of the ECB, Wim Duisenberg, has recently been interpreted as 'talking tough' about interest rates. But Duisenberg could learn a few lessons from Greenspan's recent years. Confidence in the recovery of the core German economy is still fragile, and does not need to be knocked on the head. Which brings us, last but not least, to that non-Euroland known as the UK. Here Chancellor Gordon Brown, for all the carpings from his friendly critics, has gained a reputation for great competence. Stocks in 'G Brown plc' have been rising and rising. The public seems to have enormous confidence in him. There is also a lot of confidence in the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee, despite the recent little local difficulty between the 'insiders' and 'outsiders'. But I wonder how long this confidence will last. 'We were popular when rates went down. But you watch what happens as they go up,' said one Bank man not long ago. The general expectation is that, following last week's widely expected quarter-point rise (to 5.75 per cent), UK rates are going to go up and up. The pound is already at absurdly high levels, and it is a fantasy to believe that the British economy has happily adjusted to this high exchange rate. Last time markets knew rates were going to go up and up, they drove the pound up and up. I wonder how long confidence in current policies will last if the markets do the same again.",

The mass rapes, executions and torture that he and his men practised will be remembered for generations.</p> <p>It was the pointless extremes of his violence which were so striking. Eric Stover's book on the mass graves constantly refers to Arkan. 'In the village of Bieljina,' he writes, 'they left an old woman with her eyes gouged out and her hands tied behind her back, in the street for all to see. When asked to explain what he was doing in Eastern Bosnia, Arkan told Serbian television: \"These muslims are wild dogs. This is war: us against the wild dogs\".'</p> <p>Although an intelligent man who spoke four languages, Arkan was apparently utterly without pity or remorse, which made his continued freedom in Belgrade the more hard to bear. He lived high on the hog with multiple sources of illegal revenue. He was wanted in Belgium, Finland, Italy, Sweden and Croatia. Yet he was able to exist in Belgrade, living with his pop star wife and two children in a smart suburb, not far from Slobodan Milosevic's home. He owned a football club and numerous night club interests and was involved in smuggling every possible commodity. He was the archetype of the post-communist hustler turned war criminal - dishonest to the core, vain and cowardly.</p> <p>What transformed a common thug into the war criminal will remain a mystery, but some part of his personality catalysed in the circumstances of the war. There was never any doubt that he loved what he did and by the end of the three years of butchery there had grown in him a significant force for evil.</p> <p>Stories of his personal cruelty are told over and over by muslims who survived, as if they are trying to convince themselves that they actually witnessed a human being committing such acts.</p> <p>Yet he lived - until yesterday - with apparent immunity, laughing at The Hague's claims that he would be taken and tried.</p> <p>With his contacts, wealth and cunning, Arkan might never have been caught. Only Milosevic, Mladic and the former Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, presented a greater challenge to the guile of the UN security forces.</p> <p>But they wanted Arkan most desperately, if only because of the blood he shed with such relish. His death will be greeted with bleak satisfaction throughout Europe. But whatever the grim toasts made to his killer this weekend, there will be a lingering sense that Arkan cheated justice.</p>",

The barbarity of the paramilitaries known as the Tigers achieved a special notoriety. The mass rapes, executions and torture that he and his men practised will be remembered for generations. It was the pointless extremes of his violence which were so striking. Eric Stover's book on the mass graves constantly refers to Arkan. 'In the village of Bieljina,' he writes, 'they left an old woman with her eyes gouged out and her hands tied behind her back, in the street for all to see. When asked to explain what he was doing in Eastern Bosnia, Arkan told Serbian television: \"These muslims are wild dogs. This is war: us against the wild dogs\".' Although an intelligent man who spoke four languages, Arkan was apparently utterly without pity or remorse, which made his continued freedom in Belgrade the more hard to bear. He lived high on the hog with multiple sources of illegal revenue. He was wanted in Belgium, Finland, Italy, Sweden and Croatia. Yet he was able to exist in Belgrade, living with his pop star wife and two children in a smart suburb, not far from Slobodan Milosevic's home. He owned a football club and numerous night club interests and was involved in smuggling every possible commodity. He was the archetype of the post-communist hustler turned war criminal - dishonest to the core, vain and cowardly. What transformed a common thug into the war criminal will remain a mystery, but some part of his personality catalysed in the circumstances of the war. There was never any doubt that he loved what he did and by the end of the three years of butchery there had grown in him a significant force for evil. Stories of his personal cruelty are told over and over by muslims who survived, as if they are trying to convince themselves that they actually witnessed a human being committing such acts. Yet he lived - until yesterday - with apparent immunity, laughing at The Hague's claims that he would be taken and tried. With his contacts, wealth and cunning, Arkan might never have been caught. Only Milosevic, Mladic and the former Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, presented a greater challenge to the guile of the UN security forces. But they wanted Arkan most desperately, if only because of the blood he shed with such relish. His death will be greeted with bleak satisfaction throughout Europe. But whatever the grim toasts made to his killer this weekend, there will be a lingering sense that Arkan cheated justice.",

Investigations show that:</p> <p>\u0095 A large shareholding in Lotus acquired by Ashcroft was originally built up through Benor, a company registered in Bermuda.</p> <p>\u0095 After Ashcroft eventually announced that he had acquired a stake in Lotus, the shares in question remained registered in the name of the Bermuda company.</p> <p>While the Lotus shares were being bought through the offshore company, no one had any reason to make any connection with Ashcroft. Hence no one asked whether he was working in tandem with Wickins, who was putting together a package to rescue Lotus in 1983. Indeed, there is no evidence showing Ashcroft had any link to Benor before he declared that he had bought the Lotus stake.</p> <p>Any disclosure that Wickins and Ashcroft were both investors in Lotus would have sparked intense interest: the closeness of the duo was at the time already being examined by the City watchdog overseeing mergers and takeovers. The share dealings now under scrutiny date back to 1982 and 1983 - early in a period of frenetic corporate activity when Ashcroft was one of the most high-profile dealmakers in British business building up his main company, Hawley. During this period, Ashcroft was frequently linked to Wickins, who was then head of British Car Auctions. Their association was well-known and completely open, but at that stage they rarely formally teamed up for deals.</p> <p>Under the Companies Act, large investors working together must tell any company where they are investors of any mutual interests they have - if they are in a 'concert party'.</p> <p>The rules aim to stop companies being taken over by stealth. If a single investor builds up a holding of 30 per cent or more of a company, it must formally bid for the whole concern. Similarly, two investors acting in concert will have their shareholdings added together: if these exceed 30 per cent, they will be normally have to bid.</p> <p>In the summer of 1983, just as Wickins' rescue of Lotus was coming to a climax, the question of the closeness of Ashcroft and Wickins' ties was the subject of vigorous debate. The men had to persuade the City's takeover panel that they were not working in concert in building up stakes in Cope Allman, a company making packaging and fruit machines.</p> <p>Wickins' British Car Auctions owned 13.6 per cent of Cope Allman. Had Ashcroft been judged to be working in concert with Wickins, he would have been limited to holding little more than 16 per cent of Cope: otherwise, they would have breached the 30 per cent ceiling.</p> <p>But the City's takeover panel found that that they were operating independently, so Ashcroft was able to increase his holding to 29.9 per cent. His shareholding, plus Wickins', amounted to 43.5 per cent of Cope Allman, giving them the power to introduce sweeping changes without launching a full bid.</p> <p>The panel's ruling was bitterly contested by Cope Allman, which argued unsuccessfully that Wickins and Ashcroft were clearly acting in concert and should there fore have their joint holding capped at below 30 per cent.</p> <p>What was not known at the time was that even as the Cope Allman dispute was being fought out, a large shareholding being built up in Lotus would eventually be acquired by an Ashcroft company.</p> <p>Official records show that Benor Investments of Bermuda began building up its Lotus holding on 19 December 1982, just three days after the death of Lotus founder Colin Chapman.</p> <p>Benor bought further tranches of shares until early September 1983. Over this period, Wickins emerged as the saviour of Lotus, with British Car Auctions buying new shares in the car group, underwriting the issue of further shares and securing bank loan facilities.</p> <p>In July, as the Wickins-led rescue deal was being finalised, there was intense speculation that Ashcroft would also become involved. He flatly denied this.</p> <p>But on 7 September 1983, the day that the takeover panel announced it was clearing Ashcroft and Wickins of being in a concert party in buying Cope Allman shares, an Ashcroft company announced that it had taken a 14 per cent stake in Lotus. That day, Wickins formally announced that BCA had 25 per cent of Lotus shares. So between them, the two men's companies had nearly 40 per cent of Lotus - but they were not obliged to bid.</p> <p>Analysis of the Lotus shareholders' register shows that Ashcroft's stake must have been the same as the one that had been built up over the previous nine months by Bermuda-based Benor.</p> <p>An Ashcroft spokesman said last week that he could find out nothing about Benor.</p> <p>Lotus's annual report for 1983, submitted to Companies House only in August 1984, was apparently a draft version with hand-written corrections made before it was finally printed for distribution to shareholders.</p> <p>Benor's name is printed as the holder of 14 per cent of Lotus. But this has been crossed out, and the name of the holder has been changed in handwriting to Midepsa - a company that, by then, Wickins and Ashcroft had publicly said they were using to hold their joint investments.</p> <p>Even as late as September 1984, the Lotus shareholders' register shows Benor as the holder of the stake - a stake that Ashcroft's Hawley had by now said it owned .</p> <p>In the late summer of 1983, the dispute over whether Wickins and Ashcroft were acting in concert over Cope Allman was at its height.</p> <p>So if any connection between Ashcroft and Benor's Lotus shareholding had been made, the two men would undoubtedly have faced further questioning over the closeness of their ties.On the day that Ashcroft's investment in Lotus was announced, only one person raised the issue of whether Ashcroft and Wickins had acted together or independently in building up their stakes - together amounting to nearly 40 per cent of the company.</p> <p>Lotus chairman Fred Bushell said: 'I find this all rather surprising. I believe Guinness Mahon [Lotus' merchant bank] made inquiries and was advised that there is no concert party involved.' Although the combined Ashcroft/Wickins stake was so large, they were not obliged to bid for Lotus.</p> <p>Conservative party accounts show Ashcroft as not only the Tories' biggest backer but possibly the most lavish donor the party has ever had, giving \u00a31 million a year in cash plus other valuable benefits.</p> <p>Labour MP Peter Bradley said: '[William] Hague has had to choose between financial and political bankruptcy. He clearly believes that a party without principles has better prospects than a party without cash.</p> <p>'If this is the case, he has yet again shown an extraordinary lack of judgment, for which the Conservatives will pay heavily.'</p>",

Indeed, there is no evidence showing Ashcroft had any link to Benor before he declared that he had bought the Lotus stake. Any disclosure that Wickins and Ashcroft were both investors in Lotus would have sparked intense interest: the closeness of the duo was at the time already being examined by the City watchdog overseeing mergers and takeovers. The share dealings now under scrutiny date back to 1982 and 1983 - early in a period of frenetic corporate activity when Ashcroft was one of the most high-profile dealmakers in British business building up his main company, Hawley. During this period, Ashcroft was frequently linked to Wickins, who was then head of British Car Auctions. Their association was well-known and completely open, but at that stage they rarely formally teamed up for deals. Under the Companies Act, large investors working together must tell any company where they are investors of any mutual interests they have - if they are in a 'concert party'. The rules aim to stop companies being taken over by stealth. If a single investor builds up a holding of 30 per cent or more of a company, it must formally bid for the whole concern. Similarly, two investors acting in concert will have their shareholdings added together: if these exceed 30 per cent, they will be normally have to bid. In the summer of 1983, just as Wickins' rescue of Lotus was coming to a climax, the question of the closeness of Ashcroft and Wickins' ties was the subject of vigorous debate. The men had to persuade the City's takeover panel that they were not working in concert in building up stakes in Cope Allman, a company making packaging and fruit machines. Wickins' British Car Auctions owned 13.6 per cent of Cope Allman. Had Ashcroft been judged to be working in concert with Wickins, he would have been limited to holding little more than 16 per cent of Cope: otherwise, they would have breached the 30 per cent ceiling. But the City's takeover panel found that that they were operating independently, so Ashcroft was able to increase his holding to 29.9 per cent. His shareholding, plus Wickins', amounted to 43.5 per cent of Cope Allman, giving them the power to introduce sweeping changes without launching a full bid. The panel's ruling was bitterly contested by Cope Allman, which argued unsuccessfully that Wickins and Ashcroft were clearly acting in concert and should there fore have their joint holding capped at below 30 per cent. What was not known at the time was that even as the Cope Allman dispute was being fought out, a large shareholding being built up in Lotus would eventually be acquired by an Ashcroft company. Official records show that Benor Investments of Bermuda began building up its Lotus holding on 19 December 1982, just three days after the death of Lotus founder Colin Chapman. Benor bought further tranches of shares until early September 1983. Over this period, Wickins emerged as the saviour of Lotus, with British Car Auctions buying new shares in the car group, underwriting the issue of further shares and securing bank loan facilities. In July, as the Wickins-led rescue deal was being finalised, there was intense speculation that Ashcroft would also become involved. He flatly denied this. But on 7 September 1983, the day that the takeover panel announced it was clearing Ashcroft and Wickins of being in a concert party in buying Cope Allman shares, an Ashcroft company announced that it had taken a 14 per cent stake in Lotus. That day, Wickins formally announced that BCA had 25 per cent of Lotus shares. So between them, the two men's companies had nearly 40 per cent of Lotus - but they were not obliged to bid. Analysis of the Lotus shareholders' register shows that Ashcroft's stake must have been the same as the one that had been built up over the previous nine months by Bermuda-based Benor. An Ashcroft spokesman said last week that he could find out nothing about Benor. Lotus's annual report for 1983, submitted to Companies House only in August 1984, was apparently a draft version with hand-written corrections made before it was finally printed for distribution to shareholders. Benor's name is printed as the holder of 14 per cent of Lotus. But this has been crossed out, and the name of the holder has been changed in handwriting to Midepsa - a company that, by then, Wickins and Ashcroft had publicly said they were using to hold their joint investments. Even as late as September 1984, the Lotus shareholders' register shows Benor as the holder of the stake - a stake that Ashcroft's Hawley had by now said it owned . In the late summer of 1983, the dispute over whether Wickins and Ashcroft were acting in concert over Cope Allman was at its height. So if any connection between Ashcroft and Benor's Lotus shareholding had been made, the two men would undoubtedly have faced further questioning over the closeness of their ties.On the day that Ashcroft's investment in Lotus was announced, only one person raised the issue of whether Ashcroft and Wickins had acted together or independently in building up their stakes - together amounting to nearly 40 per cent of the company. Lotus chairman Fred Bushell said: 'I find this all rather surprising. I believe Guinness Mahon [Lotus' merchant bank] made inquiries and was advised that there is no concert party involved.' Although the combined Ashcroft/Wickins stake was so large, they were not obliged to bid for Lotus. Conservative party accounts show Ashcroft as not only the Tories' biggest backer but possibly the most lavish donor the party has ever had, giving \u00a31 million a year in cash plus other valuable benefits. Labour MP Peter Bradley said: '[William] Hague has had to choose between financial and political bankruptcy. He clearly believes that a party without principles has better prospects than a party without cash. 'If this is the case, he has yet again shown an extraordinary lack of judgment, for which the Conservatives will pay heavily.'",

      "body": "<p>She has a pretty face and a sweet smile, but Anna hates her looks so much she consulted a plastic surgeon. That's no surprise these days - but Anna is 11 years old. </p> <p>Image-conscious British youngsters are electing to go under the knife in growing numbers. There is no legal minimum age and in most cases no counselling is sought or given. It is a trend one plas tic surgeon described as 'extremely frivolous and sad'. </p> <p> The Observer found clinic after clinic admitting to having given breast implants to girls of 15, 16 and 17. Girls as young as 12 have had breast reduction operations, while nose jobs and liposuction are being carried out on youngsters whose bodies have not yet matured. As pubescent stars such as Britney Spears dominate the charts and 14-year-olds strut the catwalks, children now want beauty at any cost, and teenage angst is being exploited by unregulated private clinics. </p> <p>Sandra's story is typical. At 17, she cannot yet marry without parents' consent, buy alcohol or vote. But she boasts silicone-enhanced C-cup breasts. 'All my friends are jealous,' she giggles. 'I had really little ones and I felt embarrassed. I'm more confident now and wear low tops.' </p> <p>The operation cost her father \u00a32,450. She thinks he paid it to annoy her mother, from whom he is estranged. </p> <p>Sandra is among an estimated 65,000 Britons who have cosmetic surgery each year. More and more are teenagers and at least 20 per cent will need corrective surgery later. In the US, 3 per cent of patients are under 18. American surgeon Michael Niccole has operated on hundreds. 'We are seeing a huge influx of younger people,' he says. 'Half have mothers who had operations.' </p> <p>Dr Eileen Bradbury, a psychologist from London's Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, said: 'One mustn't demonise cosmetic surgery - it can be an enormous help to those who would otherwise be deeply unhappy. But there is a huge amount of money to be made and therefore a huge amount of exploitation. Children today face a sense of competition in looking as good as possible. Even the boys - you can't just be a great footballer, you have to look like Beckham too.' </p> <p>There are risks in adolescents having surgery before they have stopped growing. A surgically reduced nose, for example, may deform as it grows. That was one reason why Professor David Sharpe turned Anna away from his Bedford clinic. A former president of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, he knows that when he turns away a patient nothing prevents them going elsewhere, and work being done quite legally by a doctor with no plastic surgery training at all. The surgeon may even have been sued in the past for malpractice. </p> <p>'I have sent four patients to a psychologist this morning alone,' said Sharpe. 'I turn down 50 per cent of cases because I'm not happy. But cowboy clinics who have to pay high malpractice premiums can't afford to turn patients away. I'm not comfortable doing breast implants in anyone under 21, although I have done. Plastic surgery is worthwhile, but often it is used in a way that is extremely frivolous and sad. </p> <p>'Breast augmentation for fashion is foolish. But a girl who is miserable because her breasts are significantly uneven should be helped.' </p> <p>Abigail Stevenage, 19 from Kidderminster, was miserable about her breast size. She had surgery in December 1998. A week after the operation her weight had risen by a quarter. She died from toxic shock due to an infection contracted through surgery. The surgeon told the inquest: 'The operation was not a serious surgical procedure, and the infection she developed was not a typical infection.' </p> <p>Her devastated mother, Christine, 45, said Abigail insisted on having the operation. 'It was always her decision,' she said. </p> <p> The Observer sent two women to five London cosmetic surgery clinics, posing as 16- and 17-year-olds. Both self-assured, slim and attractive, neither could have been mistaken for girls suffering a physical deformity or lack of confidence. The five clinics offered free consultations. Potential risks were not discussed, although credit arrangements were. They also offered discounts for two procedures done at once. </p> <p>Farrah Esmail went to two of the several clinics in Harley Street and asked for breast implants and a nose job. At the Harley Medical Group clinic she said she wanted to be 'good-looking' for a career in television. 'I asked if my age, 17, would be a problem,' said Farrah. 'They said \"no\", they do lots of girls my age and younger, and I could get a reduction - \u00a3800 off a total of \u00a36,200 - if I went ahead with both procedures.' </p> <p>At the Cosmetic Surgery Clinic, Farrah, claiming to be 16, was told she would need parental consent, but was assured surgery was not dangerous. She was seen by a nurse who discussed different types of implants. </p> <p>'She told me silicone were the most natural-looking, and that men like them best too. </p> <p>'I asked about the whole silicone scare and she said the only reason silicone was banned in some countries was because everybody just jumped on the \"bandwagon\" not because they were dangerous. I finally asked her if I should go ahead with the procedure. She said that she was supposed to give unbiased opinions, but if getting surgery would give me confidence in myself then I should do it.' </p> <p>At the Transform Clinic in nearby Wimpole Street, Lorna Fletcher was told she would have to wait until she was 18, but was offered credit terms. 'The woman said I could start paying now and have it done on my eighteenth birthday,' said Lorna. </p> <p>The stories did not surprise Labour MP Ann Clywd, a long-time campaigner for clinic regulation. 'Young girls are particularly vulnerable to sales techniques, and a lower age limit should be set.' </p> <p> Additional reporting by Lorna Fletcher and Farrah Esmail</p>",

It is a trend one plas tic surgeon described as 'extremely frivolous and sad'. The Observer found clinic after clinic admitting to having given breast implants to girls of 15, 16 and 17. Girls as young as 12 have had breast reduction operations, while nose jobs and liposuction are being carried out on youngsters whose bodies have not yet matured. As pubescent stars such as Britney Spears dominate the charts and 14-year-olds strut the catwalks, children now want beauty at any cost, and teenage angst is being exploited by unregulated private clinics. Sandra's story is typical. At 17, she cannot yet marry without parents' consent, buy alcohol or vote. But she boasts silicone-enhanced C-cup breasts. 'All my friends are jealous,' she giggles. 'I had really little ones and I felt embarrassed. I'm more confident now and wear low tops.' The operation cost her father \u00a32,450. She thinks he paid it to annoy her mother, from whom he is estranged. Sandra is among an estimated 65,000 Britons who have cosmetic surgery each year. More and more are teenagers and at least 20 per cent will need corrective surgery later. In the US, 3 per cent of patients are under 18. American surgeon Michael Niccole has operated on hundreds. 'We are seeing a huge influx of younger people,' he says. 'Half have mothers who had operations.' Dr Eileen Bradbury, a psychologist from London's Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, said: 'One mustn't demonise cosmetic surgery - it can be an enormous help to those who would otherwise be deeply unhappy. But there is a huge amount of money to be made and therefore a huge amount of exploitation. Children today face a sense of competition in looking as good as possible. Even the boys - you can't just be a great footballer, you have to look like Beckham too.' There are risks in adolescents having surgery before they have stopped growing. A surgically reduced nose, for example, may deform as it grows. That was one reason why Professor David Sharpe turned Anna away from his Bedford clinic. A former president of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, he knows that when he turns away a patient nothing prevents them going elsewhere, and work being done quite legally by a doctor with no plastic surgery training at all. The surgeon may even have been sued in the past for malpractice. 'I have sent four patients to a psychologist this morning alone,' said Sharpe. 'I turn down 50 per cent of cases because I'm not happy. But cowboy clinics who have to pay high malpractice premiums can't afford to turn patients away. I'm not comfortable doing breast implants in anyone under 21, although I have done. Plastic surgery is worthwhile, but often it is used in a way that is extremely frivolous and sad. 'Breast augmentation for fashion is foolish. But a girl who is miserable because her breasts are significantly uneven should be helped.' Abigail Stevenage, 19 from Kidderminster, was miserable about her breast size. She had surgery in December 1998. A week after the operation her weight had risen by a quarter. She died from toxic shock due to an infection contracted through surgery. The surgeon told the inquest: 'The operation was not a serious surgical procedure, and the infection she developed was not a typical infection.' Her devastated mother, Christine, 45, said Abigail insisted on having the operation. 'It was always her decision,' she said. The Observer sent two women to five London cosmetic surgery clinics, posing as 16- and 17-year-olds. Both self-assured, slim and attractive, neither could have been mistaken for girls suffering a physical deformity or lack of confidence. The five clinics offered free consultations. Potential risks were not discussed, although credit arrangements were. They also offered discounts for two procedures done at once. Farrah Esmail went to two of the several clinics in Harley Street and asked for breast implants and a nose job. At the Harley Medical Group clinic she said she wanted to be 'good-looking' for a career in television. 'I asked if my age, 17, would be a problem,' said Farrah. 'They said \"no\", they do lots of girls my age and younger, and I could get a reduction - \u00a3800 off a total of \u00a36,200 - if I went ahead with both procedures.' At the Cosmetic Surgery Clinic, Farrah, claiming to be 16, was told she would need parental consent, but was assured surgery was not dangerous. She was seen by a nurse who discussed different types of implants. 'She told me silicone were the most natural-looking, and that men like them best too. 'I asked about the whole silicone scare and she said the only reason silicone was banned in some countries was because everybody just jumped on the \"bandwagon\" not because they were dangerous. I finally asked her if I should go ahead with the procedure. She said that she was supposed to give unbiased opinions, but if getting surgery would give me confidence in myself then I should do it.' At the Transform Clinic in nearby Wimpole Street, Lorna Fletcher was told she would have to wait until she was 18, but was offered credit terms. 'The woman said I could start paying now and have it done on my eighteenth birthday,' said Lorna. The stories did not surprise Labour MP Ann Clywd, a long-time campaigner for clinic regulation. 'Young girls are particularly vulnerable to sales techniques, and a lower age limit should be set.' Additional reporting by Lorna Fletcher and Farrah Esmail",

      "body": "<p>Greg Dyke, the incoming boss of the BBC, is to defy William Hague, a Commons Select Committee and critics in commercial television by rejecting calls to pull the plug on the troubled rolling news service, News 24. </p> <p>BBC insiders say that after a shaky start the channel will be transformed into 'the CNN of the future'. One source said: 'Greg has made it clear he is a fan of News 24. The BBC ain't going to bow to pressure.' </p> <p>The move, which has the backing of BBC chairman Sir Christopher Bland, will infuriate Hague, who labelled News 24 a \u00a377 million flop last week. Writing in the Sun - whose proprietor Rupert Murdoch owns the successful News 24 rival Sky - the Tory leader said News 24 cost 'tens of millions of pounds more to run every year than the equivalent news service on Sky'. </p> <p>MPs on the Culture Select Committee will also be dismayed. Last month the committee's chairman, Labour MP Gerald Kaufman, accused the BBC of frittering away public money. 'We find it difficult to discern the justification for News 24 in view of its huge cost and small audience,' he said. </p> <p>Although Dyke, who takes over from John Birt as director-general next week, is committed to the controversial news service, he is thought likely to order a management shake-up and cost savings. The first signs came last week when corporation chiefs axed an entire layer of news and current affairs management </p> <p>When the round-the-clock news service was launched in 1997 it was hailed as an up-to-the minute rival to CNN and Sky but it has failed to win audience share. MPs on the Select Committee claimed that at times it reached fewer than 10,000 viewers. </p> <p>Senior journalists, including newsreader John Humphrys, claimed that the corporation's commitment to a rolling news service had adversely affected its journalistic output because it made 'insatiable demands' on correspondents. The service was revamped last October. </p> <p>BBC bosses have remained tight-lipped about the channel's future but Tony Hall, chief executive of news and current affairs, told The Observer News 24 would be at the heart of the BBC brand. </p> <p>'If you are in the news business and you cannot give people news when they want it, you are dead. This is a reality that it seems to have taken people years to come to terms with but it is the truth. Our critics have to face up to it. </p> <p>'News is at the core of the BBC. All the research shows how important it is. We have it in our power to be the place where people go to get their news wherever they happen to be and that's what I want to get to. If we are not there when people want us, we will gradually wither away. People will look at us and say, gosh weren't they wonderful once. </p> <p>'We will be wherever people want to have their news in the future. Wherever you are, whenever, you will have the choice of pushing the BBC button.' </p> <p>Hall admitted that News 24 had had a lacklustre start and had 'a perception problem' but he pointed out it had taken Sky and CNN almost a decade to establish themselves. New presenters such as Sue MacGregor and James Naughtie would attract new viewers and bring News 24 'into the BBC family'. </p> <p>He also questioned the Sun's decision to publish Hague's criticism and to use its editorial column to accuse the BBC of 'tipping your money down the drain'. 'Murdoch owns Sky,' he said. 'Should Murdoch have a monopoly on 24-hour news in this country?

      "bodyText": "Greg Dyke, the incoming boss of the BBC, is to defy William Hague, a Commons Select Committee and critics in commercial television by rejecting calls to pull the plug on the troubled rolling news service, News 24. BBC insiders say that after a shaky start the channel will be transformed into 'the CNN of the future'. One source said: 'Greg has made it clear he is a fan of News 24. The BBC ain't going to bow to pressure.' The move, which has the backing of BBC chairman Sir Christopher Bland, will infuriate Hague, who labelled News 24 a \u00a377 million flop last week. Writing in the Sun - whose proprietor Rupert Murdoch owns the successful News 24 rival Sky - the Tory leader said News 24 cost 'tens of millions of pounds more to run every year than the equivalent news service on Sky'. MPs on the Culture Select Committee will also be dismayed. Last month the committee's chairman, Labour MP Gerald Kaufman, accused the BBC of frittering away public money. 'We find it difficult to discern the justification for News 24 in view of its huge cost and small audience,' he said. Although Dyke, who takes over from John Birt as director-general next week, is committed to the controversial news service, he is thought likely to order a management shake-up and cost savings. The first signs came last week when corporation chiefs axed an entire layer of news and current affairs management When the round-the-clock news service was launched in 1997 it was hailed as an up-to-the minute rival to CNN and Sky but it has failed to win audience share. MPs on the Select Committee claimed that at times it reached fewer than 10,000 viewers. Senior journalists, including newsreader John Humphrys, claimed that the corporation's commitment to a rolling news service had adversely affected its journalistic output because it made 'insatiable demands' on correspondents. The service was revamped last October. BBC bosses have remained tight-lipped about the channel's future but Tony Hall, chief executive of news and current affairs, told The Observer News 24 would be at the heart of the BBC brand. 'If you are in the news business and you cannot give people news when they want it, you are dead. This is a reality that it seems to have taken people years to come to terms with but it is the truth. Our critics have to face up to it. 'News is at the core of the BBC. All the research shows how important it is. We have it in our power to be the place where people go to get their news wherever they happen to be and that's what I want to get to. If we are not there when people want us, we will gradually wither away. People will look at us and say, gosh weren't they wonderful once. 'We will be wherever people want to have their news in the future. Wherever you are, whenever, you will have the choice of pushing the BBC button.' Hall admitted that News 24 had had a lacklustre start and had 'a perception problem' but he pointed out it had taken Sky and CNN almost a decade to establish themselves. New presenters such as Sue MacGregor and James Naughtie would attract new viewers and bring News 24 'into the BBC family'. He also questioned the Sun's decision to publish Hague's criticism and to use its editorial column to accuse the BBC of 'tipping your money down the drain'. 'Murdoch owns Sky,' he said. 'Should Murdoch have a monopoly on 24-hour news in this country? No. You have a choice of going to the BBC.' The service that the BBC provides is the subject of intense debate because Culture Secretary Chris Smith is due to announce next week whether he agrees with the recommendation of Gavyn Davies, the leading economist appointed by the Government to examine BBC funding, that licence-payers should pay a \u00a324-a-year levy to fund digital services. The plans have been bitterly criticised by commercial broadcasters who fear the charge will discourage people from going digital. John.Arlidge@observer.co.uk",

The man, based in Co Cavan, is in charge of the IRA's entire arsenal. The revelation that the IRA was smuggling further arms into Ireland last summer angered Unionists and put pressure on First Minister David Trimble to pull out of talks with Sinn Fein. The release of Jacqueline McIntyre has prompted opposition parties in the Dail to demand a full statement from Justice Minister John O'Donahue about why the case against her collapsed.

They believe he was involved in placing the bomb under the solicitor's car moments after she drove away from her house. Rosemary Nelson's murder prompted allegations of security force collusion in the killing. The murder was carried out by an alliance of LVF members in Portadown, the dissident Red Hand Defenders group and members of the Ulster Defence Association from west Belfast - who made the bomb. Relatives of the murdered solicitor yesterday accused the authorities of undermining the 'principles of justice' in the handling of her case. Nelson's parents, sisters and brothers have written to the Director of Public Prosecutions in Northern Ireland and Irish Secretary Peter Mandelson to condemn the decision that no RUC officers - who were alleged to have threatened the solicitor - will be prosecuted.

      "body": "<p>Meet single woman. She lives in an airy loft apartment of blond wood floors and bright white walls on the fringes of the City. She has two large marble-clad bathrooms but uses only one. Her bed is a mattress on the floor because she moved in just a few months ago and hasn't had time to build the frame. She has a tidy spare bedroom for visiting friends, a wardrobe full of power suits and a bottle of extra virgin olive oil by the hob. She is oh so very now.</p> <p>Single Woman is not an imaginary composite, cobbled together from the dubious findings of hack consumer surveys. She is a real person and I am in her \u00a3500,000 flat checking out the contents of her fridge - although she doesn't know it. Being single and unencumbered, she has decided to sell up and take a new banking job abroad, even though she only just started living here. The estate agent overseeing the sale suggested we meet in her flat to discuss the impact of people like Single Woman upon his business and I am taking the opportunity to do some research. Or snoop, as it's more commonly known.</p> <p>Because Single Woman is not just some cultural oddity. She is our future. In 1961 the proportion of households occupied by just one person was 10 per cent. Today that figure is 30 per cent. The Department of the Environment estimates that by 2010 it will have reached 40 per cent. In short, there will be more single-person households than any other kind. The cause, according to a report from the Henley Centre for Forecasting, is the triple whammy of 'increased affluence, the break-up of relationships and lower rates of marriage'. The second of those causes is a given: people become single because they are no longer part of a couple. It is reasons one and three which are more interesting. They suggest that major personal decisions are being made. 'Singledom is no longer something that only happens to you solely because of a relationship breakdown,' says Helen Wilkinson, a director of the think tank Demos, who has researched the subject. 'It may actually be a positive choice.'</p> <p>There is, it seems, a growing tribe: the New Singletons. They are marrying less and divorcing more. They are steering clear of emotional commitments. They are avoiding parenthood. The only ambition many of us now have is not to be an 'us' at all. It is to be an 'I'. The New Singleton wants to be alone.</p> <p>The impact of this vast social change will be felt everywhere, not just in the banal arithmetic of the housing market but in our cultural lives: in the books we read, the television programmes we watch and the films we go out to see. The publication in 1996 of Helen Fielding's book Bridget Jones's Diary , has long been credited with giving a voice to a particular kind of desperate thirty-something woman for whom being single is an affliction or disease. It sold over a million copies and was followed by myriad imitators. Already, however, it seems an outmoded model.</p> <p>The shift in attitudes that has taken place can now be traced most acutely not on the page but on the screen, in the career of one Hugh Grant, who went from Sad Singleton to New Singleton in the space of just two movies. In the 1994 film Four Weddings and a Funeral he played Charles, a pathologically single man, incapable of commitment, uncertain of what he wanted and no happier for that; the kind of man, in fact, who would have made Bridget Jones's life a misery. Five years later, in last year's Notting Hill , he played William. He too was single but there was nothing particularly desperate about it. His singleness was just the state in which he found himself after a failed marriage, in a world where so many marriages do. He wanted a new relationship but not just so that he was no longer alone. He specifically wanted a relationship with Julia Roberts.</p> <p>That unremarkable shifting between the coupled and the uncoupled state is also a feature of the New Singleton's lifestyle. 'There is this assumption that there are these two groups, the singles and the smug marrieds,' says Wilkinson. 'But it's not like that any more. Actually they interchange all the time.' Wilkinson knows what she's talking about. Her last co-habiting relationship finished four years ago. 'For me being single is neither a positive nor a negative state,' she says. 'It's just what I happen to be. I thoroughly expect at some time to meet someone else but I am very aware now of what I would be giving up if I went into a relationship. I love my own space.' She lives in a development of 2000 flats in London's East End which she describes as 'a self-created community' with its own bars, restaurants and a gym. 'They are people with shared values. In that sense you don't feel alone.'</p> <p>Ian Murray, a 29-year-old senior research executive at the polling organisation Mori, which has conducted surveys on singledom, agrees. 'Most of the people I know in London are single. We live in our own flats doing our own thing. It's a lot more acceptable now. People don't look at you with pity in supermarkets because of the ready meals in your basket.' Would he like a relationship? He's really not sure. 'You get used to being single and you come to like it. And that makes it more and more difficult to compromise. I get into relationships and find I can't make that compromise.'</p> <p>In the area where our Single Woman lives on the edge of the City a whole social infrastructure has developed to support her lifestyle. Bars and restaurants, their facades gilded with neon, have sprung up all over the district, usually in the ground-floor units of new residential blocks converted from unused office space.</p> <p>'Fifteen thousand new homes have been created within a mile and a half of here in the past three years,' says David Salvi of Hurford Salvi Carr Estate Agents. 'Of those, at least 50 per cent have been bought by single people. As a result the bars are alive in the evenings. The social life is good but it's definitely for unencumbered living.' I ask him if he had ever thought of buying one? 'I have two kids and I couldn't imagine family life here. External space is in short supply so there are no gardens, and of course roof terraces aren't ideal for children.'</p> <p>I examine the contents of Single Woman's fridge: a few blocks of cheese, some cooked chicken, a bag of fresh pasta and a jar of pesto. 'Definitely not a family fridge,' the estate agent says. In the freezer there are three tubs of ice cream, a bag of ice cubes and a frozen leg of lamb, presumably for when she entertains which, statistically, single people do far more regularly than couples. The rest of the time food will be bought according to the demands of convenience. 'For many of my clients the Marks &amp; Spencer food shop at Moorgate is a godsend,' Salvi says.</p> <p>I take a trip to this M&amp;S food hall, an inner-city temple to single living. Young men and women float up and down the ready-meal aisles alone, filling their baskets with single servings of chicken risotto and prawn rogan josh, tagliatelle with chicken, tomato and basil and even ready-made mash (yours for \u00a31.99.) At present, M&amp;S has the local market to itself. Four years ago both Tesco and Sainsbury's considered building a new store near here but decided against it because they perceived a lack of future consumer demand. Now they are fighting over the only available site.</p> <p>It's not surprising they should be desperate to move into an area highly populated by New Singletons. Over the past year Tesco has seen a 63 per cent increase in the sales of its meals for one. Likewise Sainsbury's has discovered a market for single servings of bagged salad. They sold five million in 1999. Some of this is the result of fractured family eating habits but, equally, a lot of it is down to the rise in the number of people living and eating alone.</p> <p>There is little doubt that this 'ready-meal and white wine' lifestyle has so far been reflected most extensively in books - in the novels of Jane Green and Marian Keyes, Isabel Wolff and Freya North - though it seems now that the appetite for the single thirtysomething book is all but sated. 'Offer a publisher a book about being single and a woman and looking for love and they'll groan,' says literary agent Jo Frank. 'They'll say the trend has come and gone even though there may be more and more single people in society.'</p> <p>Carolyn Mays, editorial director of Hodder which publishes Arabella Weir's Does My Bum Look Big In This? and Mike Gayle's My Legendary Girlfriend, concurs. 'We are still being offered lots of novels about single life,' she says. 'But the books that we're most interested in now are the ones where the issues of being single and trying to find a mate are dealt with in a different way. There's one going round now where the protagonist has to choose between two men and there are two endings. The reader gets to decide which one she should end up with. In the end I think the single character will just become an accepted part of the fictional landscape.'</p> <p>For the novelist William Sutcliffe, whose latest book, The Love Hexagon , deals with relationships between twentysomethings, the problem with the novels published so far has been their over-obsession with gender difference. 'In my experience personality traits like an inability to commit have nothing to do with gender. Gender differences are shrinking and now non-sexual friendships across the divide are becoming easier and easier.'</p> <p>Ironically, he says, this is one of the reasons people are staying single for longer. 'Romance becomes harder because traditional romantic gestures seem cheesy. A proffered red rose looks naff. It's easier to woo someone in a world where men are men and women are women.' In any case, he says, it's deeply old-fashioned to equate singleness with bleakness. 'Maybe we're staying single because we're getting more out of our friendships so the need for pair bonds reduces. In my latest book the only couple who get married are the least pleasant. Marriage is their punishment, not their reward. It's what they deserve.' It is, Sutcliffe says, his revenge on Jane Austen.</p> <p>Television drama has lagged a little behind fiction, though only because so many of their ideas come from the pages of novels, sometimes bought for adaptation. At the forefront of TV drama's assault on the subject was, of course, This Life , the shambling story of young lawyers on the make and their Byzantine couplings. It's been followed by the likes of Big Bad World, Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married and Wonderful You .</p> <p>According to Jane Tranter, head of serials at the BBC, this rash of dramas self-consciously dealing with the lives of single people has probably run its course, just as it has in books. 'We're going to have to look in a slightly different way at the issue and be rather more truthful about it,' she says. She accepts that in future scriptwriters may simply have to make a point of including characters who are single. 'Every so often in the past there's been an effort to put representatives of ethnic minorities into ensemble pieces without making a fuss about it. Maybe representatives of the single lifestyle should start appearing in the same way. Perhaps we should have a happy single character pop up in EastEnders without their single state being an issue.'</p> <p>Notting Hill aside, the eventual impact of the New Singletons on the movies may be harder to define. It's not that the issue has been ignored. Already we've had British movies like This Year's Love and Martha Meet Frank Daniel and Lawrence which happily dwelt on the single lifestyle. But inevitably they tumbled towards a paired-off ending (as, indeed, did both Four Weddings and Notting Hill ). 'It's perceived that movies need that kind of conclusion,' said one script development executive. 'I have yet to see a script in which the lead character starts off single and decides to stay that way for the next 90 minutes.' That said, the movies have a good record of reflecting changing social mores. Changing attitudes to sex outside marriage in Britain, for example, were first most acutely reflected in the 1960 movie Saturday Night Sunday Morning ; it seems unlikely that British film will miss such an obvious trend as the rise of the New Singleton.</p> <p>As to popular music the impact will simply be economic. The classic pop song is, and always has been, about falling in love and falling out of love, very much the meat and potatoes of the singleton's lifestyle. That will not change. 'But more people will be buying the records,' says songwriter and producer Pete Waterman. 'Single people always buy more music and it remains a social part of their lives for much longer.' They also tend to have younger tastes than their married contemporaries, he says. 'He may be into the Propellerheads while his married friend is listening to Clapton.'</p> <p>Inevitably that will be the most obvious result of the New Singleton's rise: the youthing of society. Consumer trend analysts are already talking about a further boom in health and fitness clubs for singles concerned about their appearance as they slip, unencumbered and randy, into young middle-age. With no commitments their expendable income will be high and their spending - on clothes and music, eating out and holidaying - will be equally so. The retail industry will have to adapt to meet their needs.</p> <p>Meanwhile the smug marrieds sitting out in the suburbs with their gardens for the kids and their two-car drives and their regimented bedtimes - the people who for so long have represented some socially desirable norm - may find that they are the ones who are now the excluded minority, their lifestyle less and less represented on screen and in books. As they watch their increasingly youthful New Singleton contemporaries out there playing the scene, living how they want where they want, answering to no one and loving it, they may suddenly start asking themselves what it is exactly that they have to feel so damn smug about.</p>",

Maybe representatives of the single lifestyle should start appearing in the same way. Perhaps we should have a happy single character pop up in EastEnders without their single state being an issue.' Notting Hill aside, the eventual impact of the New Singletons on the movies may be harder to define. It's not that the issue has been ignored. Already we've had British movies like This Year's Love and Martha Meet Frank Daniel and Lawrence which happily dwelt on the single lifestyle. But inevitably they tumbled towards a paired-off ending (as, indeed, did both Four Weddings and Notting Hill ). 'It's perceived that movies need that kind of conclusion,' said one script development executive. 'I have yet to see a script in which the lead character starts off single and decides to stay that way for the next 90 minutes.' That said, the movies have a good record of reflecting changing social mores. Changing attitudes to sex outside marriage in Britain, for example, were first most acutely reflected in the 1960 movie Saturday Night Sunday Morning ; it seems unlikely that British film will miss such an obvious trend as the rise of the New Singleton. As to popular music the impact will simply be economic. The classic pop song is, and always has been, about falling in love and falling out of love, very much the meat and potatoes of the singleton's lifestyle. That will not change. 'But more people will be buying the records,' says songwriter and producer Pete Waterman. 'Single people always buy more music and it remains a social part of their lives for much longer.' They also tend to have younger tastes than their married contemporaries, he says. 'He may be into the Propellerheads while his married friend is listening to Clapton.' Inevitably that will be the most obvious result of the New Singleton's rise: the youthing of society. Consumer trend analysts are already talking about a further boom in health and fitness clubs for singles concerned about their appearance as they slip, unencumbered and randy, into young middle-age. With no commitments their expendable income will be high and their spending - on clothes and music, eating out and holidaying - will be equally so. The retail industry will have to adapt to meet their needs. Meanwhile the smug marrieds sitting out in the suburbs with their gardens for the kids and their two-car drives and their regimented bedtimes - the people who for so long have represented some socially desirable norm - may find that they are the ones who are now the excluded minority, their lifestyle less and less represented on screen and in books. As they watch their increasingly youthful New Singleton contemporaries out there playing the scene, living how they want where they want, answering to no one and loving it, they may suddenly start asking themselves what it is exactly that they have to feel so damn smug about.",

The security services have agreed that files earmarked for destruction should be subject to independent scrutiny by PRO staff with security clearance. The Home Secretary revealed nearly 18 months ago that MI5 retains 440,000 files, of which 290,000 relate to individuals who have been subject to investigation or inquiry. Some 20,000 files were classified as green or active. The security services will strenuously oppose any such right of access.",

      "body": "<p>A recent survey by Mintel revealed that, when it comes to cosmetics and skincare, 73 per cent of women believe that the pricier the product, the better it performs. But are we right to be so sceptical about the cheaper end of the market?</p> <p><b> The \u00a33.30 foundation<br> No17 Perfect Cover Foundation</b></p> <p>This foundation claims to offer good coverage, UVA and UVB protection and contain light diffusers, which are often used in more expensive foundations to help disguise wrinkles.</p> <p><b> The expert: dermatologist Dr Elisabeth Dancey, a specialist in skin ageing</b><br> 'Despite the fact that the No17 range is aimed at younger women, this would be a brilliant product for any age skin. It has a moisturising formula and is high in pigment, so it covers well. It is also quite possible that it will make the face look younger - it contains titanium dioxide, which as well as being a sunblock (hence the UV protection) also bounces light off the skin and so softens the look of fine lines and wrinkles. An additional benefit is that it is also very low on allergens. My only criticism is that although it says it protects against UV light, it doesn't give an SPF and it warns against wearing while sunbathing, which makes me think protection is probably low. The labelling should be clearer. Eighty per cent of skin ageing is caused by the sun, and people should choose products with an SPF of 15 or over. Still, for use at night, this is an exceptionally good product.'</p> <p><b> The \u00a31.69 mascara<br> Collection 2000 Longer-Lash Mascara</b></p> <p>This product uses a mix of keratin, silicone and other ingredients to give longer, thicker lashes, and also contains vitamin B5 for conditioning.</p> <p><b> The expert: optometrist Christopher Kerr, adviser to the Association of Contact Lens Manufacturers and the Eyecare Information Service</b><br> 'My staff tested this and said it's one of the best mascaras they have ever used in terms of lash-lengthening effect. It also comes off easily and leaves lashes soft. However, from an opthalmological point of view, this product does contain two preservatives - methylparaben and propylparaben. These are known eye allergens which also have an anaesthetic effect on the eye. This means that if any mascara gets into the eye (ie, if the fibres flake), this anaesthetic effect could prevent the wearer from feeling discomfort and so lead to damage or infection. But the product contains a high level of beeswax, which reduces risk of flaking anyway. It's a bargain - but do not use it if you've got very sensitive eyes.'</p> <p><b> The \u00a32.09 moisturiser <br> Boots Traditional Skin Care Moisturising Lotion with Vitamins A and E</b></p> <p>Vitamins have taken over from AHAs (alpha-hydroxy acids) as the anti-ageing skincare ingredient of choice, but not many of the products that have flooded the market come at this price.</p> <p><b> The expert: consultant dermatologist Dr Ravi Ratnavel from Thames Valley Nuffield Hospital</b> <br> 'In terms of moisturising, this product contains the necessary mix of water and glycerine to hydrate skin. It is also well absorbed, but its watery formulation may not be suitable for older or extremely sun-damaged skins, which often respond better to thicker or greasier formulations. However, if you are buying it because of the vitamin content, don't be fooled. For starters, when applied topically, vitamin E has never been proven scientifically to have any anti-ageing benefits on the skin. Vitamin A has, but only in certain forms: tretonoin - which is only available on prescription - and retinol, which is often included in pricier brands. This lotion contains neither of these. So it is a good basic moisturiser but not a bargain anti-ageing product.'</p> <p><b> The \u00a32.49 shampoo and conditioner<br> Pantene 2-in-1 Shampoo Plus Conditioner for Dry or Damaged Hair</b></p> <p>This one-application product claims to cleanse and condition even the trickiest hair in minutes.</p> <p><b> The expert: leading trichologist Philip Kingsley</b><br> 'The most important thing to look for when you buy any hair product is that it is suitable for your hair type, and as far as I'm concerned no '2-in-1' is suitable for dry and damaged hair. The problem with 2-in-1 products is that they condition the hair evenly - generally the roots of the hair need very little moisture and the ends a lot. Also, the main conditioner in this product is dimethicone, which is a silicone, and while silicones are great conditioners, they do weigh down fine hair. In terms of cleansing, I had to use a lot of the product to get a lather, but it did clean the hair well. I found it quite difficult to comb the hair through afterwards though, which means despite the silicone, its conditioning power is probably low. All things considered, for regular use, I'd say you would be better spending a bit more and buying two separate products.'</p> <p><b> The \u00a32 nail varnish<br> Spectacular Nail Polish</b></p> <p>This nail varnish claims to be free of formaldehyde (a common allergen) and toluene, which has been linked to cancer risk. It also claims to be long-lasting and hardwearing.</p> <p><b> The expert: top manicurist Iris Chapple</b><br> 'When it comes to nail varnish, high price certainly doesn't guarantee a good product. I really liked this polish and was surprised by how long it lasted on the nail; formaldehyde and toluene are normally used to stop products chipping, so I expected this to chip quickly. In fact, it lasted three days. It also covers the nail very well, although the brush is dreadful. It's too wide at the bottom, which makes for blobbing and streaking.

      "bodyText": "A recent survey by Mintel revealed that, when it comes to cosmetics and skincare, 73 per cent of women believe that the pricier the product, the better it performs. But are we right to be so sceptical about the cheaper end of the market? The \u00a33.30 foundation No17 Perfect Cover Foundation This foundation claims to offer good coverage, UVA and UVB protection and contain light diffusers, which are often used in more expensive foundations to help disguise wrinkles. The expert: dermatologist Dr Elisabeth Dancey, a specialist in skin ageing 'Despite the fact that the No17 range is aimed at younger women, this would be a brilliant product for any age skin. It has a moisturising formula and is high in pigment, so it covers well. It is also quite possible that it will make the face look younger - it contains titanium dioxide, which as well as being a sunblock (hence the UV protection) also bounces light off the skin and so softens the look of fine lines and wrinkles. An additional benefit is that it is also very low on allergens. My only criticism is that although it says it protects against UV light, it doesn't give an SPF and it warns against wearing while sunbathing, which makes me think protection is probably low. The labelling should be clearer. Eighty per cent of skin ageing is caused by the sun, and people should choose products with an SPF of 15 or over. Still, for use at night, this is an exceptionally good product.' The \u00a31.69 mascara Collection 2000 Longer-Lash Mascara This product uses a mix of keratin, silicone and other ingredients to give longer, thicker lashes, and also contains vitamin B5 for conditioning. The expert: optometrist Christopher Kerr, adviser to the Association of Contact Lens Manufacturers and the Eyecare Information Service 'My staff tested this and said it's one of the best mascaras they have ever used in terms of lash-lengthening effect. It also comes off easily and leaves lashes soft. However, from an opthalmological point of view, this product does contain two preservatives - methylparaben and propylparaben. These are known eye allergens which also have an anaesthetic effect on the eye. This means that if any mascara gets into the eye (ie, if the fibres flake), this anaesthetic effect could prevent the wearer from feeling discomfort and so lead to damage or infection. But the product contains a high level of beeswax, which reduces risk of flaking anyway. It's a bargain - but do not use it if you've got very sensitive eyes.' The \u00a32.09 moisturiser Boots Traditional Skin Care Moisturising Lotion with Vitamins A and E Vitamins have taken over from AHAs (alpha-hydroxy acids) as the anti-ageing skincare ingredient of choice, but not many of the products that have flooded the market come at this price. The expert: consultant dermatologist Dr Ravi Ratnavel from Thames Valley Nuffield Hospital 'In terms of moisturising, this product contains the necessary mix of water and glycerine to hydrate skin. It is also well absorbed, but its watery formulation may not be suitable for older or extremely sun-damaged skins, which often respond better to thicker or greasier formulations. However, if you are buying it because of the vitamin content, don't be fooled. For starters, when applied topically, vitamin E has never been proven scientifically to have any anti-ageing benefits on the skin. Vitamin A has, but only in certain forms: tretonoin - which is only available on prescription - and retinol, which is often included in pricier brands. This lotion contains neither of these. So it is a good basic moisturiser but not a bargain anti-ageing product.' The \u00a32.49 shampoo and conditioner Pantene 2-in-1 Shampoo Plus Conditioner for Dry or Damaged Hair This one-application product claims to cleanse and condition even the trickiest hair in minutes. The expert: leading trichologist Philip Kingsley 'The most important thing to look for when you buy any hair product is that it is suitable for your hair type, and as far as I'm concerned no '2-in-1' is suitable for dry and damaged hair. The problem with 2-in-1 products is that they condition the hair evenly - generally the roots of the hair need very little moisture and the ends a lot. Also, the main conditioner in this product is dimethicone, which is a silicone, and while silicones are great conditioners, they do weigh down fine hair. In terms of cleansing, I had to use a lot of the product to get a lather, but it did clean the hair well. I found it quite difficult to comb the hair through afterwards though, which means despite the silicone, its conditioning power is probably low. All things considered, for regular use, I'd say you would be better spending a bit more and buying two separate products.' The \u00a32 nail varnish Spectacular Nail Polish This nail varnish claims to be free of formaldehyde (a common allergen) and toluene, which has been linked to cancer risk. It also claims to be long-lasting and hardwearing. The expert: top manicurist Iris Chapple 'When it comes to nail varnish, high price certainly doesn't guarantee a good product. I really liked this polish and was surprised by how long it lasted on the nail; formaldehyde and toluene are normally used to stop products chipping, so I expected this to chip quickly. In fact, it lasted three days. It also covers the nail very well, although the brush is dreadful. It's too wide at the bottom, which makes for blobbing and streaking. My only other reservation is that the colour on the outside of the bottle is quite different from the result you get from two thin coats - you would need four thin coats to get anywhere near the right shade. Still, all things considered, this is a bargain.' The \u00a31.09 shower gel and body lotion Superdrug Purit\u00e9 2-in-1 Shower &amp; Lotion This 2-in-1 product claims to cleanse and moisturise the skin, reducing the need for a body lotion. It is fragrance-free and suitable for sensitive skins. The expert: cosmetic pharmacist and skincare researcher Dr Colette Haydon 'According to the label, this contains both cleansing and moisturising ingredients, so it will do what it says. However, this is a soap-free formula and so uses a detergent (sodium laryl sulphate or SLS) to cleanse the skin.

      "body": "<b>James Dyson:</b> Mark and I have an innate love of design in common. Mark's enthusiasm for it pervades everything. He drives a Ducatti, the ultimate design motorbike, and zooms out of the car park at 90 mph every night. I discovered design at the Royal College of Art (RCA) in the mid-Sixties. I helped to design the Sea Truck [military boat] as part of my degree course. I then organised the manufacturing and selling of them for five years. In a sense, I was an arms salesman; many of them were sold for military use. Scottish lairds also went crazy for it. The Sea Truck's ability to land on beaches meant that they could ferry sheep and provisions from island to island without the need for a jetty. I wanted to do something on my own and had the idea for the Ballbarrow [a wheelbarrow with a ball instead of a wheel]. I made every type of mistake, but it did capture a large chunk of the market, which gave me the confidence to do vacuum cleaners. <p>After 12 years cleaning my house, I got fed up with vacuum cleaners. I put in a new bag and was amazed to discover that while it worked well for a couple of rooms, by the third it wasn't picking up dust. The bag was empty, but the first dust that went into it blocked the bag and clogged the pores. That is what spurred me to think of the dual cyclone, which spins the dust out of the air by a non-clogging technique. </p> <p> In the beginning, it was just me. I had a coach house across the yard at my old house near Bath. I started employing engineer/designers in 1987. In the mid-Eighties, we started getting licenses to make vacuums for Japanese and US companies. We lurched from one financial crisis to another, but we just about managed to keep our heads above water. </p> <p>In the early 1990s, we decided to make our own product, the DC01. Mark joined us in 1992. I needed engineers with training in design and it was natural for me to go back to the RCA to recruit. </p> <p>Suddenly, Mark was involved in things he had no experience of, such as going to Taiwan to find and supervise toolmakers during a civil unrest. You can give people from college total authority from the word go and they respond brilliantly. Mark is an absolute shining example of that. </p> <p>I react more emotionally to things than him, and he's a much better people manager. I don't think he has any weak points, which is why he's head of Research and Development and a group board director at a very young age (31). </p> <p>I wouldn't want Mark to become a competitor. I'm aware that people may well want to leave and do their own thing. </p> <p> That's fine by me. I did the same. However, I wouldn't say I'd encourage it. </p> <p> I'm not extravagant; I have about two outfits. I have the odd holiday, a week off in January somewhere hot, and two weeks in the summer at our house in Provence. </p> <p> I truthfully like vacuuming. I learn a lot from housework; things that are inefficient give me ideas. It isn't the money - coming up with products that work better is my motivation. People will buy something if it works better, even if it's more expensive. I don't want to get big, either. We're not empire building. </p> <p><b>Mark Bickerstaffe:</b> The company has grown so fast and achieved so much. It was very risky in the early days, but we felt it was up to us to make it work. We'd be working in the coach house overnight, slaving away, with matchsticks propping open our eyes, and the light in James' house would click on. Ten minutes later, he would wander over with coffee and hot cross buns. James is very good at motivating people. </p> <p>James is incredibly shrewd and bright. You can have an in-depth technical discussion for hours, consult James, and at the drop of a hat he's got your answer. James is not just a designer - he has a business mind. It's that combination that I respect. Because he's so motivated, he wants to get involved with everything, and with a business this size, it's a bit difficult. We do have some fairly heated debates sometimes. </p> <p> James is an open, frank human being who I would classify as a friend. There's a lot of interchange: he came to my wedding; I've been round to his house for meals; I go fishing on his water, sometimes with his son Jacob. James and his wife Deirdre live in an old mill house near Malmesbury - where the Dyson Head Office is situated - that they bought from Lord Puttnam. It has 38 acres, with a river running pretty much past the house. </p> <p>We've seen James' family grow with the business. When I started, his youngest son Sam was at school and his older son Jacob was just off to university. Now Sam works as a designer at Dyson, and Jacob and his daughter Emily have their own businesses - Jacob designing products and interiors, Emily, bed linen and nightwear. </p> <p>Each new employee goes on the production line, builds a vacuum cleaner, buys it and takes it home. I must have about seven or eight. I do use them, but I also have a cleaning lady. My favourite upright is the DC03. It's lightweight and the design is fantastic. There are other domestic appliances in development but I can't talk about them yet. We might be five years away from bringing a product out - but it's all top secret, I don't even talk about it to my wife. </p> <p>If you're up to the job, then age or experience are fairly irrelevant at Dyson. What matters most is your ability. There's a lot of very young senior management for a company of this size. James lets you run with it and make mistakes. He's the first to say as long as we've learned something, it's not disastrous. He gives people vision, the capability to do anything. </p> <p> The next five to 10 years won't see me needing to move anywhere for another challenge. A lot of people would have to say that if they came up with a good idea, they'd love to do a Dyson, do it themselves. Yes, I would like to set up my own business. You go so far, and then you want to have the success that James has had.</p>",

Clearing these objects from fields and from the outskirts of African and Asian cities has become a major political concern and has triggered considerable interest in the British project.</p> <p>'At present the only really effective way of clearing mines is to try to dig them up, or detonate them with some kind of robot vehicle,' said Dundee University mathematician Dr Paul Smith, a researcher involved in the new detector's development. 'It's a slow and dangerous business.'</p> <p>The device designed by Dr Smith and his collaborators at Dera gets around such risks by exploiting a technique known as ultra-wideband synthetic aperture radar.</p> <p>At the heart of the machine, a specially designed generator is used to emit powerful but very brief bursts of electrical energy, every thousandth of a second. These pulses consist of energy that covers a very wide part of the electromagnetic spectrum, and this is bounced back from objects in ways that differ according to their wavelength.</p> <p>The device's detector then builds up a series of images created by these different reflected pulses and combines them to create a picture of nearby objects.</p> <p>'Essentially, we can create images of any object that has been buried or hidden and from its shape tell whether it is man-made or not, and therefore whether it is potentially lethal or harmless,' says Smith.</p> <p>'We have already completed successful preliminary tests, and hope to complete full trials in the near future.

Clearing these objects from fields and from the outskirts of African and Asian cities has become a major political concern and has triggered considerable interest in the British project. 'At present the only really effective way of clearing mines is to try to dig them up, or detonate them with some kind of robot vehicle,' said Dundee University mathematician Dr Paul Smith, a researcher involved in the new detector's development. 'It's a slow and dangerous business.' The device designed by Dr Smith and his collaborators at Dera gets around such risks by exploiting a technique known as ultra-wideband synthetic aperture radar. At the heart of the machine, a specially designed generator is used to emit powerful but very brief bursts of electrical energy, every thousandth of a second. These pulses consist of energy that covers a very wide part of the electromagnetic spectrum, and this is bounced back from objects in ways that differ according to their wavelength. The device's detector then builds up a series of images created by these different reflected pulses and combines them to create a picture of nearby objects. 'Essentially, we can create images of any object that has been buried or hidden and from its shape tell whether it is man-made or not, and therefore whether it is potentially lethal or harmless,' says Smith. 'We have already completed successful preliminary tests, and hope to complete full trials in the near future. Hopefully we can then begin landmine clearing in earnest after that.'",

Stuart Bell MP On 21 November 1999, in 'Church Commissioners drawn into GM crop dispute', we said that Stuart Bell, MP, the Second Church Estates Commissioner, was a paid consultant for Bell Pottinger, whose client list includes Monsanto. We did not intend to suggest that there was a conflict of interest on the part of Mr Bell. We also said that Monsanto paid for an overseas visit to France. This was wrong. Mr Bell has never accepted free travel to France or anywhere else for Monsanto or any other company involved in the GM industry. We apologise to Mr Bell for any embarrassment caused.",

For the quiet village of Chabenet, set in the flat countryside of central France, the reconstruction of her death should have been the most gripping event since Michael Jackson tried to buy the the local chateau. But at 9.06am, when sirens announced the impending arrival of the test train, few locals were up. Later, a few families arrived with children and dogs. Afterwards the local bar, taken by surprise, struggled to cope with the demands of the international press for drinks and phones. As the reconstruction began of a crime - one in a series of train killings that has thrown the French criminal justice system into disarray - a hush fell on the waiting crowd. The noise of the approaching express became deafening. As it thundered into view in a gloomy cutting, a life-sized dummy, dressed in a white top, black trousers and trainers - similar to those worn by Peake on the day of her death in October - appeared at a window cradled in the arms of an obscure figure on board. The dummy was forced from the window. It bounced head first off the track and flicked up, hitting the side of the train. It was decapitated, smashed against a post and scattered in pieces in the dirt just yards from where Peake's corpse was found. White powder dusted on the side of the track enabled investigating police to analyse how the body fell. The position of the mutilated dummy was carefully recorded on film before it was gathered up for analysis. Detectives from Peake's home county of Staffordshire, Peter Sharratt-Freeman and Diane Marne, joined investigating magistrates and gendarmes on the express to witness the reconstruction. The operation was coordinated by Remy Julienne, a stunt adviser engaged by the French Transport Ministry to assist police with the reconstruction, repeated four times during the day. Julienne, 69, has worked on almost 50 films including James Bond features For Your Eyes Only, Octopussy, The Living Daylights, Licence To Kill and Goldeneye . He also co-ordinated car stunt scenes in the 1969 classic The Italian Job . Early shortcomings in the investigation into Peake's death could lead to an unsuccessful prosecution of chief murder suspect Sid Ahmed Rezala, 20, detained in Portugal last week. His extradition to France could take three months. In France itself, magistrates and police are competing to be the first to interview him about the three crimes of which he is suspected in what the Paris newspaper Lib\u00e9ration last week called a judicial 'free-for-all'. It took police nine days to open the Peake inquiry during which time the Brive-Paris train was left in service and cleaned at least twice, destroying any potential forensic evidence. If, during the course of their investigation, French police prove that Peake could have fallen from the train without assistance, they would be spared the embarrassment of a murder prosecution against Rezala proving unsuccessful through lack of evidence. But Jean-Paul Thibault, lawyer for the Peake family, expressed his confidence in the investigations. 'I am satisfied Rezala has been arrested but it remains for his guilt to be proved in this atrocious crime.' The extradition from Portugal of Rezala was originally expected to take only 48 hours. But his lawyers are taking advantage of Portuguese laws which forbid the extradition of suspects who risk a higher sentence than the maximum 25 years in jail in Portugal. Rezala faces a life sentence - the limit to be set by a judge - in France if he is found guilty of killing Peake, Corinne Caillaux, 36, and Emilie Bazin, 20. Rezala's defence is being paid for by a Spanish businessman whom he met in Madrid's gay quarter while on the run from French police in December. The two men were said to have had a 'passionate relationship'. Rezala was due to leave with his Spanish lover for the Canaries only hours before he was arrested in a Lisbon suburb. Unless a special dispensation is granted by the Portuguese authorities under the Schengen agreement, which covers emergency extradition procedures in the EU, Rezala will have to be released from custody during the run up to a court hearing. So far, French detectives in Lisbon have not been allowed to question him about Peake or the deaths of Caillaux, murdered in the Calais-Riviera night train on December 13, and Bazin, who disappeared in Amiens in October after a meeting with Rezala. From the start, the hunt for Rezala was one of the most bungled investigations in French police history and may lead to a complete overhaul of the judicial system. Poor collaboration between police forces and local examining magistrates was evident from the day Peake's body was found on 13 October. Despite her parents' concern, a murder investigation was not started for 10 days. A communications breakdown between police and the state railways meant that the link between a known rapist and a man answering his description who had been caught travelling without a ticket to Limoges went unnoticed. By the time Emilie Bazin's body was discovered on 17 December, five examining magistrates, the national police, the gendarmerie and the police judiciaire (CID) were working on separate inquiries.",

      "body": "<p>Marcel Proust, one of France's greatest writers, had a sharp - some would say nasty - sense of humour. What he would have made of the news that his novel, a massive and elaborate meditation set among the French aristocracy from the 1870s to the 1920s, was enjoying a revival in 2000, is hard to imagine. Proud, no doubt - but he would also, surely, have found it very, very funny. </p> <p>What has a highly strung, gay, culturally elitist Frenchman, whose mental world was fed by a rigid caste system he described as Hindu, a life of seaside holidays in grand hotels, glittering and interminable dinners, Parisian balls and provincial gossip, got to say to the world of the Internet and of Euro-federalism? </p> <p>Quite a lot, it seems. The growth in book sales since the release of a new French film of the final part of A la recherche du temps perdu (or Remembrance of Things Past as it is generally known in English) has been modest - hundreds, not thousands, of extra copies - but enough to surprise booksellers in the UK. In France, the film has been a hit and Proust is enjoying a major revival. </p> <p>Certainly Ra\u00fal Ruiz's film of Time Regained is the best of several stabs at translating Proust's allusive and reflective tale for the cinema. But this is not saying much. Filming Proust is a little like painting a late Beethoven quartet, or trying to make Westminster Cathedral into a ballet: heroic, but also silly. Proust, poor man, worked in the days before the book, the film, the novelisation of the film of the book, the CD of the soundtrack and the Playstation game were all released together. He thought words - some 1.3 million of them - were enough. </p> <p>Yet the film was rapturously received in France, where Proust has seemed to be less revered than he is among British intellectuals. There, they have tended to regard him as a brilliant social humorist, rather than as the philosophical and aesthetic guru hailed by Bloomsbury and later generations of thick-tweeded and flannel-shirted Proustiens anglais. Perhaps, belatedly, the profound, pessimistic patriotism of Proust and his placing of a little agricultural town near Chartres as the emblem of old France, la France profonde, has struck a chord. </p> <p>Illers was where Proust spent childhood holidays, and which he used to create his famous 'Combray'. It is not a pretentious place, still a hard-working farmers' town in the middle of a vast and featureless plain, with small factories clustered around it. The bars are rough, thick with smoke and guttural voices, the people amused by the fuss. Once, Illiers was a stopping-place for Catholic pilgrims - hence the scallop-shaped madeleine cakes that so famously began Proust's search for lost time. Now it is a shrine to Proust and the pilgrims still come, somewhat to the locals' bemusement. </p> <p>'The film? No, I have not seen it, and I have not read the book either. But if the English want to come here and spend their money, that's fine by me,' said a laughing stallholder at the Friday market. The tourist officer hadn't seen the film either, but she was selling a formidable array of Proust-related souvenirs, biographies and even the new comic-strip book of his first volume, which she recommended vigorously. </p> <p>Illiers is like France in having an ambiguous relationship with Proust. Some of the most sacred places to Proust-addicts have vanished from the town. The road he loved most, the Rue de L'Oiseau Flesche, named after an ancient inn where medieval archers met to shoot birds tied to poles, has been renamed and the inn has vanished. After a lot of tramping up and down, I decided the inn was probably what is now a garage. The old church with its famous spire still looks the same, though its ancient stained glass, which he loved, has gone, bombed in 1940. </p> <p>But the house where he stayed, his Aunt L\u00e9onie's, is still there, a Proust museum, with the garden bell that Swann rang when he came to visit in the 1880s, and you can still walk along the little River Loir - Proust's Vivonne - which is an unearthly bright blue-green colour, just as he described it. The town still looks, from the fields by the river, very like the medieval cluster he knew, with 'the woolly grey backs of its huddled houses'. On a raw January afternoon it smells, satisfyingly, of cabbages and wet mud and the river. </p> <p>And above all, whatever its inhabitants think of their local hero, they know a good thing when they see it, going so far as to rename the place Illiers-Combray to attract visitors - rather as if Lichfield had decided to call itself Middlemarch, or Scotland's major city decided to lure Alasdair Gray readers by calling itself Glasgow-Unthank. </p> <p>But it is a tricky business, coaxing a living from such a lively, unpredictable book. One of the most resonant names in the Combray volume is 'Montjouvain', a country house based on a real one, about 20 minutes' walk from the town, called Mirougrain. There, as one hoped, stands the extraordinary rocky house, above a little blue-green lake. When I arrived, a caretaker, with a shotgun and a very large black dog, was contemplating trees that had been ripped up by the recent storm. What did he think of the new interest in Proust? He looked at me stolidly, then turned and very deliberately spat. His dog snarled. Mirougrain says 'non'. </p> <p>And yet, up the road, the civic camping ground has been named 'Montjouvain', presumably in homage. Did the authorities, trying to get the right atmosphere for holidaymakers, know that Mont-jouvain is famous because that was where the young narrator spies on two sadistic lesbians? Probably not. He remains, everywhere, more talked about than actually read, no doubt because of the daunting size of his great work. But could it be that, in France and Britain, because of our 30-second-soundbite culture and our slim, slight novels, the prospect of something completely different is beginning to appeal? Because it isn't only the film. In the New Year round-up of millennial 'greatest writer ever' lists, Proust was chosen with surprising regularity. </p> <p>In recent years, there have been Proust cook-books, that French comic-strip version, three films and two revised translations, pruning back the more purple prose and the many inaccuracies in Scott Moncrieff's version. Alain de Botton produced a short volume, posing as a kind of impossibly intellectual self-help book called How Proust Can Change Your Life. The collected letters are being published - the last volume will be reviewed this month in The Observer. Penguin is bringing out a new biography, by Jean-Yves Tadie, professor of French literature at the Sorbonne, in the spring. </p> <p>And, above all, a complete new translation, with seven separate translators, one for each volume, is being prepared, also by Penguin, and will be published next year. It will be a shock to traditionalist British Proustians, offer ing a harder, more authentic version. The traditional English title will be replaced by the more accurate In Search of Lost Time. The series editor, Christopher Prendergast, now teaching in Copenhagen, says it will be 'a bloody good read' and an antidote to the 'recipe-book Proust' of de Botton and others. </p> <p>One of the translators, John Sturrock of the London Review of Books , argues that Scott Moncrieff's Edwardian prose 'is exactly what Proust himself abandoned with some shame when he was quite young ... this is a very cruel book. It is a comic book, but the comedy is not always very funny.' </p> <p>If this radical brushing-down of Proust brings new readers, it can only be a good thing. For, to declare my hand, In Search of Lost Time is one of the two or three greatest novels of all time, anywhere. Tolstoy is perhaps the only obvious rival. Hence the passion. </p> <p>The idea of a literary 'pilgrimage' to Illiers - a place the novelist has recast and reshaped - is inherently absurd. 'Illiers-Combray' reminded me of lots of other small agricultural towns. Yet it is quite a power to draw people from all over to one little place, merely because, more than a century ago, a very clever small boy walked here, happened to sit in these pews, to walk past that butcher's shop, or listen to those church bells. Proust inspires a cult-like enthusiasm, a fervent adulation among his readers which can border on the embarrassing. His new translators' argument with the old school is essentially that he's a story-teller, not a religion. </p> <p>Yet there are good reasons for the emotion he inspires. Reading Proust can be almost hallucinatory, sharpening the reader's sense of smell, colour and character for some time afterwards. And, for all the elaborate prose and setting, there is a simple and universal message from the book - the agonising realisation that time really does pass, and all our lives are lost, and can be regained in art but nowhere else. Behind the obscure duchesses and gossipy writers, this is the story of the modern, irreligious Everyman. </p> <p>In the end, the best answer to the question, 'why should I read Proust?' sounds almost offensive - because Proust had a better brain than the rest of us. But readers who doubt this have only one solution - to go out and lift A la recherche du temps perdu from number 544 to a little higher in the fiction bestseller list.</p>",

The series editor, Christopher Prendergast, now teaching in Copenhagen, says it will be 'a bloody good read' and an antidote to the 'recipe-book Proust' of de Botton and others. One of the translators, John Sturrock of the London Review of Books , argues that Scott Moncrieff's Edwardian prose 'is exactly what Proust himself abandoned with some shame when he was quite young ... this is a very cruel book. It is a comic book, but the comedy is not always very funny.' If this radical brushing-down of Proust brings new readers, it can only be a good thing. For, to declare my hand, In Search of Lost Time is one of the two or three greatest novels of all time, anywhere. Tolstoy is perhaps the only obvious rival. Hence the passion. The idea of a literary 'pilgrimage' to Illiers - a place the novelist has recast and reshaped - is inherently absurd. 'Illiers-Combray' reminded me of lots of other small agricultural towns. Yet it is quite a power to draw people from all over to one little place, merely because, more than a century ago, a very clever small boy walked here, happened to sit in these pews, to walk past that butcher's shop, or listen to those church bells. Proust inspires a cult-like enthusiasm, a fervent adulation among his readers which can border on the embarrassing. His new translators' argument with the old school is essentially that he's a story-teller, not a religion. Yet there are good reasons for the emotion he inspires. Reading Proust can be almost hallucinatory, sharpening the reader's sense of smell, colour and character for some time afterwards. And, for all the elaborate prose and setting, there is a simple and universal message from the book - the agonising realisation that time really does pass, and all our lives are lost, and can be regained in art but nowhere else. Behind the obscure duchesses and gossipy writers, this is the story of the modern, irreligious Everyman. In the end, the best answer to the question, 'why should I read Proust?' sounds almost offensive - because Proust had a better brain than the rest of us. But readers who doubt this have only one solution - to go out and lift A la recherche du temps perdu from number 544 to a little higher in the fiction bestseller list.",

What's the difference between saving and investment? The Penguin English Dictionary defines saving as 'money accumulated by economising' while investment is defined as 'laying out money for a return'. In the investment business, saving tends to be used to describe money held in bank or building society accounts; cash deposits where there is no risk to capital. Investments are generally deemed to be savings that carry a greater risk, in return for a higher return in the long term. But many of the companies that run stock market funds also offer savings schemes, particularly the investment trust companies.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Demand for newly built homes is at an all-time high. Developers and estate agents report properties selling up to nine months in advance of a single brick being laid, and government inspectors have recommended that another 1.1 million homes be built by 2016 in the South East alone. </p> <p>Just before Christmas, 20 out of 25 apartments in a Galliard Homes development in Clapham, south London, were sold within two weeks of the plans going on display, although the new owners will not be able to move in until autumn. This demand is largely driven by the shortage of property - any property - in southern England. But this does not explain the 10-12 per cent premium builders are able to charge for new homes compared with second-hand properties. </p> <p>During the housing market slump of the late Eighties and early Nineties, developers were tempting prospective buyers with offers to pay legal fees, shared ownership deals, low-cost mortgages, holidays in exotic destinations and, in certain cases, a free Porsche. Everyone wanted a home that was at least 100 years old, with all the period features. Edwardian homes were just about acceptable, provided they had coloured glass windows and verandahs. New-builds were bought by people with no taste or those who couldn't afford anything else. </p> <p>But now a second market has developed among people who like the clean lines and low maintenance requirements of a new property. </p> <p>Guy Foster of Friend &amp; Falcke Estate Agents in Clapham says: 'Although period homes are still sought after - particularly by families - some people are now moving towards a more contemporary way of living.' </p> <p>Such buyers are not swayed by gimmicks. Foster says: 'Buyers of today have a lot more savvy. They would rather have the quality in finish than a free holiday. As a result there's a lot more character being put in now, and more care and attention than in the late 80s, when new developments were basically rabbit hutches.' </p> <p>New developments are also a good option for first-time buyers. They offer the advantage of no chain, straightforward leasing arrangements and no wrangles over management bills. In most cases the price of the property will include cooker, fridge/freezer and even dishwasher. </p> <p>Buyers who can afford to spend a little more get a lot of say in the way their property is designed and finished. David Marsh of Bradford &amp; Bingley estate agents says people can specify what they want in terms of decoration, and changes can be made to the positioning of partitions since the advent of concrete ceilings.

      "bodyText": "Demand for newly built homes is at an all-time high. Developers and estate agents report properties selling up to nine months in advance of a single brick being laid, and government inspectors have recommended that another 1.1 million homes be built by 2016 in the South East alone. Just before Christmas, 20 out of 25 apartments in a Galliard Homes development in Clapham, south London, were sold within two weeks of the plans going on display, although the new owners will not be able to move in until autumn. This demand is largely driven by the shortage of property - any property - in southern England. But this does not explain the 10-12 per cent premium builders are able to charge for new homes compared with second-hand properties. During the housing market slump of the late Eighties and early Nineties, developers were tempting prospective buyers with offers to pay legal fees, shared ownership deals, low-cost mortgages, holidays in exotic destinations and, in certain cases, a free Porsche. Everyone wanted a home that was at least 100 years old, with all the period features. Edwardian homes were just about acceptable, provided they had coloured glass windows and verandahs. New-builds were bought by people with no taste or those who couldn't afford anything else. But now a second market has developed among people who like the clean lines and low maintenance requirements of a new property. Guy Foster of Friend &amp; Falcke Estate Agents in Clapham says: 'Although period homes are still sought after - particularly by families - some people are now moving towards a more contemporary way of living.' Such buyers are not swayed by gimmicks. Foster says: 'Buyers of today have a lot more savvy. They would rather have the quality in finish than a free holiday. As a result there's a lot more character being put in now, and more care and attention than in the late 80s, when new developments were basically rabbit hutches.' New developments are also a good option for first-time buyers. They offer the advantage of no chain, straightforward leasing arrangements and no wrangles over management bills. In most cases the price of the property will include cooker, fridge/freezer and even dishwasher. Buyers who can afford to spend a little more get a lot of say in the way their property is designed and finished. David Marsh of Bradford &amp; Bingley estate agents says people can specify what they want in terms of decoration, and changes can be made to the positioning of partitions since the advent of concrete ceilings. This means people who prefer space to a large quantity of rooms can, for example, convert five bedrooms into three with en suite bathrooms and a dressing room. But the prime attraction, as far as Marsh is concerned, is low maintenance. Many new properties have small - or no - gardens, and the structure should be in a pristine state. Any problems that do crop up, such as cracks between walls and ceilings, should be covered by the 10-year Buildmark Cover, a warranty backed by the National House Building Council (NHBC), provided the builder is registered. This has made the new-build very popular with empty nesters, who want to be able to lock up their UK home for several months at a time while they travel abroad. Adrian Barrick, editor of weekly construction magazine Building, says that not all development problems have been ironed out. 'We still come across a lot of cases where new owners feel their homes haven't been finished off properly, or in some cases, not built by the completion date.' He cites two recent cases where homeowners had to move into unfinished properties. But Barrick agrees that most developers are now keenly aware of the need to protect and improve their reputation for quality work. Reputable builders will, he says, check on properties to make sure the owner is happy, even outside the terms of the guarantee. Barrick has lived in both a newly built flat and a period house in the recent past, so has experienced the advantages and disadvantages of both types of property.

She wants to take the tax-free cash from her pension, but is also wondering how to invest that money. </p> <p>Her other investments include \u00a310,000 in premium bonds. She started to buy them three or four years ago and has received prizes equivalent to between 3 and 9 per cent each year since. She also has two Peps - one linked to the NPI Global Care fund, now worth just over \u00a35,000, the other with Jupiter European. She invested \u00a36,000 in the latter two years ago, but it was recently worth a disappointing \u00a36,300. </p> <p>Other savings consist of two fixed-rate bonds, one for \u00a37,000 maturing in February and the other for \u00a35,000 coming to an end later in the year. Barbara also has about \u00a31,000 in an instant access account. </p> <p>She owns some shares left her by her mother, which are now worth around \u00a34,000, but wants to hang on to them: 'They pay a dividend on my birthday.

You may fret for weeks about the choice of runs, the quality of powder and the distance from your chalet front door to the ski lift, but the price of a beer, hiring boots or a childminder in the resort are just as important. </p> <p>Research by travel agent Thomas Cook shows that careful selection of your resort could save you hundreds of pounds - possibly even enough to pay for another skiing holiday. The travel agent's annual Cost of holiday living index compares the cost of all the vital ingredients of a winter sports holiday, including ski hire, lift passes and ski school, in 10 resorts around the world. And for those who recognise that life does exist off the slopes, the index also surveys the cost of pleasurable extras, such as a glass of schnapps or coffee in the local caf\u00e9, a stick of sun block or a three-course set meal. </p> <p>The table shows that for the basics - ski and boot hire, an area lift pass and five or six days' ski school - Breckenridge in the US is by far the most expensive at \u00a3621, followed by Banff in Canada at \u00a3312.10. The Romanian resort of Poiana Brasov is the cheapest, with the same basics costing \u00a3119.50. </p> <p>The price of apr\u00e8s-ski also varies widely, with the high cost of alcohol in Norway making the resort of Lillehammer the most expensive. A bottle of house wine will set you back \u00a319, a glass of schnapps \u00a34 and beer \u00a32.80. However, the resort may still appeal to parents with young children because it offers the cheapest kindergarten at \u00a34.75 a day. In contrast, parents in Breckenridge could face charges of up to \u00a336.90 a day. </p> <p>The figures for the survey were collected by ski reps in each resort. However, Vicki Burwell, a spokeswoman for Thomas Cook, warns that the prices for optional purchases will not be precise: 'When it comes to the cost of food, drink and things like sun block, the prices will depend on exactly where you shop. The survey is intended simply as a guide for people who are skiing on a budget so they know roughly how much money they will need to take.' </p> <p><strong> How to get the best value</strong></p> <p> \u0095 Avoid the peak seasons of New Year, Easter and other school holidays. Before Christmas, resorts tend to be quiet - but the snow may be absent as well, particularly below 1800m. If you can book last minute, you should be able to take advantage of good snow reports and cheap prices. Good deals and better snow are more likely after New Year until the second week in February. </p> <p>\u0095 Self-catering is a false economy unless you are prepared to lug all the food to the resort in your suitcase. Although a self-catering holiday may seem the cheapest, buying food in a ski resort is usually heinously expensive. And after a hard day on the slopes, do you really want to slave over a hot stove? </p> <p>\u0095 Buying all your ski gear will be expensive - and a bit of a gamble if you haven't skiied before. Borrow as much as possible from friends, and rent the rest. Mountain Bike &amp; Ski Company in Victoria, London (0207 435 0124) charges \u00a314.95 per jacket or trousers and \u00a310 for ski boots for 12 days hire (plus a deposit of \u00a350 per person). To buy the same gear could cost you more than \u00a3200. </p> <p>\u0095 It's generally considered better to hire skis and poles in the resort so you don't have to haul them with you, and so you can switch them if necessary. But more experienced skiiers who know the type of skis they need may prefer to rent in the UK in advance rather than wasting the first morning on holiday. </p> <p>\u0095 Consider joining the Ski Club of Great Britain. The annual membership of \u00a366 for a family, \u00a345 for an individual, or \u00a310 for someone under the age of 24, provides access to discounts of up to 15 per cent off holidays with more than 100 tour operators, 20 per cent of equipment hire in ski resorts, and 15 per cent at UK dry ski slopes, plus extensive advice and snow reports, and free guiding in 35 resorts.

The weeks are generally in low season periods (mainly January) and usually include the cost of equipment, liftpass and ski school. </p> <p>\u0095 Buy an insurance policy that covers you for all potential activities. Although you may not intend to go off-piste, you could lose your way and end up having an accident, so make sure this is included in the terms of your policy.

Wade through the foaming web sites of the anti-Semites, weekend militiamen and Republicans and it becomes clear that many among America's well-armed citizenry have performed the same calculation. Because if there is any hope of the ceasefire that they fear, it will come out of the barrel of a law suit. </p> <p>First, the score. Gunshot deaths in the States are way down - to only 88 a day. Eighty-seven thousand lucky Americans were treated for bullet wounds last year; another 32,436 unlucky ones died, including a dozen policemen by their own weapons. In one typical case, a young man, Steven Fox, described feeling pieces of his brain fly from his skull after a mugger shot him. Fox is permanently paralysed. </p> <p>But, hey, that's business for you. And what a business it is. Guns, ammo and accessories are a $6 billion-a-year honey pot for several corporations: Browning, Smith &amp; Wesson, Colt and others. </p> <p>Britain loves stories of gun lust in the US. It is an opportunity for snooty comparisons with America's crude and lawless society. This drives Elisa Barnes crazy. </p> <p>Barnes is the lawyer who recently brought a groundbreaking law suit against handgun manufacturers, which were found negligent in the shooting of Fox. 'You EC guys are so smug. Glock, Browning, Beretta have these refined European owners. Smith and Wesson is the number one seller of killer guns and it's owned by Tomkins plc, of England.' </p> <p>Armed crime is traditionally viewed as a social problem, but Barnes thought it was too convenient for gun makers to blame the criminal alone.

      "bodyText": "There are 2 million guns in civilian hands in the US. That works out at 200 per lawyer. Wade through the foaming web sites of the anti-Semites, weekend militiamen and Republicans and it becomes clear that many among America's well-armed citizenry have performed the same calculation. Because if there is any hope of the ceasefire that they fear, it will come out of the barrel of a law suit. First, the score. Gunshot deaths in the States are way down - to only 88 a day. Eighty-seven thousand lucky Americans were treated for bullet wounds last year; another 32,436 unlucky ones died, including a dozen policemen by their own weapons. In one typical case, a young man, Steven Fox, described feeling pieces of his brain fly from his skull after a mugger shot him. Fox is permanently paralysed. But, hey, that's business for you. And what a business it is. Guns, ammo and accessories are a $6 billion-a-year honey pot for several corporations: Browning, Smith &amp; Wesson, Colt and others. Britain loves stories of gun lust in the US. It is an opportunity for snooty comparisons with America's crude and lawless society. This drives Elisa Barnes crazy. Barnes is the lawyer who recently brought a groundbreaking law suit against handgun manufacturers, which were found negligent in the shooting of Fox. 'You EC guys are so smug. Glock, Browning, Beretta have these refined European owners. Smith and Wesson is the number one seller of killer guns and it's owned by Tomkins plc, of England.' Armed crime is traditionally viewed as a social problem, but Barnes thought it was too convenient for gun makers to blame the criminal alone. Through investigation and statistical analysis she concluded that sales to criminals are a much-valued - if unpublicised - market segment sought out and provisioned by these upstanding manufacturers. Her calculations are compelling. Gun companies dumped several million weapons into outlets in states with few curbs on purchases, super-saturating the legal market so that excess would flow up the so-called 'Iron Pipeline' to meet black market demand in New York and other big cities. Like the company that sells cigarette rolling papers in quantities far outstripping sales of legal tobacco leaf, gun manufacturers have a wink-and-nod understanding of where their products end up. Their own market models cannot account for half the gun sales in loose-law states such as Georgia. Nor can industry executives fail to have noticed the requests - more than 800,000 of them - to manufacturers from the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agency (the Untouchables of movie fame) to trace guns captured by police after use in crimes . The Fox case jury found a dozen gun makers guilty of negligent distribution. The shooter's gun was never found. Unable to determine which company made the gun that fired the bullet into Fox's head, the jury ordered all the maker of .25 calibre weapons in the case to pony up altogether $5 million for Fox's care and pain. Fox's victory burst the dam. Several hundred lawyers - including the Costanza group, the combine of firms that mangled the tobacco industry - filed suits to make sure the gun industry feels our pain. The City of New Orleans is the first of dozens of cities in court demanding that gun purveyors pay the cost of gathering the wounded off the streets, and the cost of arming the municipal police force in self-defence.

Two months earlier, when Bull had done the rounds of institutional investors to discuss plans for the appointment of David Bremner as chief executive of the company's UK supermarkets, with Dino Adriano as chief executive of the whole group, his attempts to explain the move had been greeted by less than rapturous acclaim. Since then, Sainsbury had delivered lacklustre figures. Competition in the food retailing industry had intensified. Bull was aware that there was appetite for a more fundamental change at the top of the company. In Bull's words, 'We needed now to have more pace, more power upfront.'</p> <p>So, early in December, non-executives of Sainsbury had held a discreet meeting at the City offices of Warburgs, the retailer's financial advisers. They knew that they had to fill a vacancy on the board, as Sir David Scholey had announced he was to quit. But as they talked, the directors agreed that it was time to consider something much more fundamental - the replacement of Dino Adriano as chief executive. Hence Bull now found himself in Davis's office at the Pru: would Davis consider becoming chief executive of Sainsbury? It was one of Britain's best-loved high street names, but a company that had lost its former glory.</p> <p>'Peter didn't actually throw George out of that first meeting,' said one insider. 'But neither did he offer many olive branches.' Bull's spoof about the Marketing Council was easily forgiven: the two men's relationship went back decades, from when the young Bull, selling drinks for Grand Metropolitan, had had to pitch to Davis, then working in Sainsbury's marketing department. Davis agreed to think it over. Bull said he needed to talk to his fellow directors. The non-executives agreed that although there were perhaps three or four people they would consider to replace Adriano, Davis came first.</p> <p>Davis was torn. Since leaving Sainsbury 14 years before, as assistant managing director, he had headed publisher Reed and subsequently the Pru. He was looking forward to winding down his responsibilities with the insurer, aiming initially to devote three days a week to chairing the company, then cutting back to two days. But Davis had retained an affection for the retailer. He had been saddened to see it being steadily eclipsed over the past six years. And Davis, as much as Sainsbury's leading rivals, recognised that turning around the operation was one of the great opportunities in British business. </p> <p>Bull and Davis met just once more at the Pru. But over the Christmas break there was a stream of telephone calls and faxes between Bull's home in Essex and Davis's in Hertfordshire. Eventually, a deal was done. Davis would join on a basic salary of \u00a3750,000 a year plus bonus - and the potential for becoming seriously rich if he could push Sainsbury's earnings faster than inflation, and if the share price rose.</p> <p>By 4 January, Bull felt certain that his agreement with Davis would hold. So that day he broke the news to Adriano: he was to be replaced as chief executive. Adriano cannot have been completely surprised. Some of Sainsbury's leading shareholders had been voicing their dissatisfaction with him for a year or more, and much of the press had been vicious in criticism of his failure to lift Sainsbury's fortunes. Judging by the stock market's reaction on Friday, investors approved the appointment of Davis. Sainsbury shares rose 5 per cent. And Bull was able to point out that the team which will be running the company is now very different from the one that has been charge for much of the past few years. David Sainsbury has been out of the picture for nearly 18 months. And Davis is new - at least in the sense that he hasn't worked at Sainsbury since the company's glory days. Kevin McCarten, who will forever be associated with the chain's disastrous 'Value to Shout About' advertising campaign, is being shifted into the position of stores director. His former position - marketing director - is being filled by an outsider, Sara Weller, who has been retail marketing director at Abbey National.</p> <p>After news of his appointment last week, Davis said he aimed to 'give the business some clear direction and self-confidence ... When I worked there before, people said with some pride that they worked for Sainsbury. 'I'd like to see that restored. I get the feeling that recently, people have had their tails down.'

      "bodyText": "Nuclear reprocessor and generator British Nuclear Fuels this week faces being stripped of a vital international quality assurance standard after admitting that it had falsified safety records on monitoring the production of highly dangerous mixed oxide nuclear fuel (MOX) at its Sellafield plant in Cumbria. Loss of the standard - known as ISO 9002 - which assures BNFL customers that it has high management and quality control processes and 'is in control of the way it does things', would be a severe blow to the company. BNFL is waiting for ministerial clearance to open a \u00a3300 million MOX plant at Sellafield, an important element in government plans for a partial privatisation of the company. The extent of international demand for MOX fuel is unclear; government figures indicate that just under 7 per cent of the Sellafield plant's capacity is accounted for in future contracts. Since the falsifications came to light in September, key future customers have indicated unhappiness with the fuel and the quality assurance processes at BNFL. Last week Japanese utility Kansai Electric said it would return the first MOX consignment which arrived there in December. In the same month Swiss nuclear safety authorities said they had discovered faults with BNFL's MOX. A three-month investigation into BNFL's management processes by inspectors at Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance, which monitors the ISO 9002, was concluded last week. BNFL has submitted an exhaustive report detailing measures to be introduced to prevent the falsification happening again. Ian Hodgkinson, managing director of LRQA, said that withdrawal of the stan dard was clearly an option: 'When a system is found to be non- compliant with the requirements of the standard, we will withdraw the standard. Withdrawal of the standard is always an option.' More than 20,000 organisations worldwide were covered by the standard; 22 were withdrawn last year. Greenpeace Nuclear campaigner Helen Wallace said: 'It is a joke for BNFL to have a quality standards award, given the fiasco that has occurred at Sellafield in relation to Japanese fuel.'

      "body": "<p>In 55 BC, as most schoolchildren know, Julius Caesar took the underprepared ancient Britons by surprise and invaded their country. Eight centuries later, the Vikings tested our sea defences with their longboats and found them wanting. </p> <p>A millennium on our force in the Crimea was so badly provisioned that even the coffee beans were not roasted. And as Germany built panzers and stukas in the 1930s, Britain's armchair generals were still fighting the previous war. </p> <p>So when it emerged that our men in Kosovo last year had SA80 rifles that jammed and obsolete Clansman radios that broadcast their intentions to the enemy, it rounded off two millennia of military logistical failure. </p> <p>It was also embarrassing for a government that last year included the armed forces among the institutions it was making 'fit for the new millennium' and launched an overhaul of the system for buying military equipment called Smart Procurement. </p> <p>This will, it claims, shake up the stuffy corridors of the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and establish a clear relationship between the civil servants and army officers who have traditionally spent years dithering over which radio/ tank/ship they want the forces to use and which companies are to be instructed to make them. Costs and delays will, ministers hope, fall. </p> <p>There is much work to be done. Cost overruns on the biggest projects totalled \u00a32.8 billion last year, according to the National Audit Office, which has tracked the top 25 since 1993. Between then and 1996 overruns increased from 2.6 per cent of original approval price to 8.7 per cent. The figure has subsequently dropped to 5.9 per cent, thanks largely to exchange rate effects. </p> <p>Delays are simply getting worse. The 1998 NAO report found average delays increasing from 32 months in 1993 to 43 months in 1998, and stated: 'There is no sign of the trend in the department's performance stabilising or improving.' Smart Procurement is intended to change all this. </p> <p>But we have been here before. Brigadier Bill Kincaid is a former soldier and director of operational requirements at the MoD. This, in the old system, meant the man who tried to work out in advance what the army needed. 'People have tried to make changes in the past. But the problem is, reliability of equipment has traditionally been low. In the Falklands, for example, Rapier surface-to-air missiles simply did not work.' </p> <p>It is a similar story with tanks. Major-General Alan Sharman, who now heads the Defence Manufacturers Association, is a former MoD official who was involved in vehicle procurement. He points to the Chieftain, the army's main battle tank in the 1970s. 'The Chieftain's Achilles heel was its automotive system. The L60 engine, produced by the government-owned Leyland, was unreliable, going only 1,500 km between services. The engine never lasted long, and there were never enough spares.' </p> <p>The last shake-up of defence procurement was launched to deal with such problems. Its architect, chief of defence procurement Peter Levene, imposed a Thatcherite framework on the arms business, breaking up the government-industrial complex. There was to be a clear division of responsibilities between the MoD and privatised defence companies. There were to be prime contractors, who managed projects and assumed risk, and competition among British and foreign firms. </p> <p>But problems continued: attempts by GEC Marconi to devise an early warning radar system for the RAF's Nimrod failed, at a cost of \u00a31 billion; the American Awac system was bought instead. </p> <p>The tank programme floundered on. Challenger 1, originally built for the Shah of Iran, was intended to upgrade the Chieftain. 'The new armaments systems were not well-integrated,' says Sharman. But the real problems for Challenger came in 1991, in the Gulf War, when tanks had to be cannibalised for spares. </p> <p>'This was back to one of the problems with Chieftain,' Sharman says. 'The man who orders the equipment wants money upfront. He doesn't worry about spares and support in the field.' That's someone else's problem. </p> <p>Even as late as last September only two-thirds of new Challenger 2 tanks were operational. A mere 39 per cent of Challenger 1 tanks were fully operational. Both figures had declined from the year before. </p> <p>British defence companies claim most British equipment is good. They say the problems are organisational - the delays and cost overruns reflect the bureaucratic culture of the MoD. </p> <p>The NAO identifies several causes of cost inflation and delay, including project definition, technical difficulties and budgetary constraints - which covers just about everything. </p> <p>Take the air-launched anti-armour weapon, Brimstone. It was commissioned in 1982, when feasibility studies indicated readiness by December 1991. Problems have pushed this back to October 2001. The result is that the army has been using the less effective BL-755 for a decade longer than planned, and the Government has spent \u00a310 million upgrading it. Similar difficulties accompanied one of the most notorious procurement delays of all: the yet-to-be delivered Bowman radio. </p> <p>Not only did the Kosovo force have its Clansman calls monitored, but spares were not easily to hand, and roughly a third were not working during the crisis. In addition, says Kincaid, the Bowman delay is holding up the introduction of digital command and control systems. In short, he says, delay affects quality. </p> <p>And delay is linked to cost. The MoD procurement budget has fallen 16 per cent in real terms from \u00a39.9bn in 1990-91. Sharman says: 'The MoD does not have the money to meet its aspirations, so it consistently has to delay projects.' He cites as an example the two-year delay in the introduction of Challenger 2. The MoD blames the builder, Vickers. The NAO similarly blames budgetary constraints for 24 months of the 92-month delay in introducing anti- tank MR Trigat missile. </p> <p>But can it simply be the MoD's fault? Military systems are complex, as is managing such a massive budget. There are security considerations that do not exist in other areas, and the MoD is subject to often extreme political interference. </p> <p>Smart Procurement is intended to ease these problems. Instead of competition, Labour has emphasised 'partnership' - getting the MoD and companies to work together to minimise problems. In addition, the convoluted procurement process has been simplified, with a clear main decision point. A single 'central MoD customer' has been created, and the Defence Procurement Agency will act for it. A Defence Logistics Organisation will add accountability between procurement and support. Some 145 Integrated Project Teams (IPTs) with MoD and industry members will steer 1,200 projects. Chief of Defense Staff Sir Robert Walmsley said: 'The idea is to set our targets hard and fast at the main decision point in procurement rather than it creeping along with no expenditure and delays increasing.' Walmsley added that he was negotiating with the NAO to write off past delays and rebase future reports to reflect this. </p> <p>Some welcome the moves. Rolls-Royce, for example, says recent contracts - bidding for the Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft and the \u00a3350m upgrade of the RAF's GR7 Harrier engines - as models of Smart Procurement. But there are sceptics. One defence contractor says: 'This is a cultural problem and it is going to take years to change.' Another said: 'There are already problems with the IPTs. Some are better than others, and only two are led by people from industry.' </p> <p>Sharman believes the split between procurement and logistics is likely to create problems: 'I would like to see one man in charge of the lot, otherwise you still have lack of accountability.' </p> <p>Digby Waller, defence economist at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, points to deeper problems: 'These are demanding technical programmes, and there is high technical risk. This converts into financial risk, which the industry is reluctant to take.' It is not clear if Smart Procurement can make up for this. </p> <p>And there is a classic economic dilemma underlying the whole process. 'There is a fundamental moral hazard problem here,' says Waller. 'The Government interferes because it knows if things go wrong it will have no national defence companies - and no defence. The companies know this.' Waller cites Rolls-Royce, which bankrupted itself trying to produce the RB211 aero-engine in the early 1970s. The Government rescued the company by nationalising it. </p> <p>The Strategic Defence review and Smart Procurement may be buzzwords for streamlining procurement. But will they alter the millennia-old attitude that the forces get what they say they need, whatever the cost?</p>",

Surely that just vindicates Tomkins' strategy? </p> <p>'Yes, but,' is the City's reply. And the big but for Tomkins is what will these sales achieve? A full-scale auction of the food business is in progress following the cancellation of plans for a demerger, and Tomkins advisers are indicating that it could fetch as much as \u00a31.75 billion. </p> <p>That would be excellent news. Ian Rennardson, analyst at broker Merrill Lynch, estimates that it has spent around \u00a31.5bn on the business, including the cost of acquiring Ranks Hovis McDougall in 1992, as well as restructuring costs and capital spending. To sell it for anything less would be an admission that the critics, who have shunned Tomkins' shares almost since the RHM deal was concluded, were right. </p> <p>But how realistic are Tomkins' hopes for \u00a31.75bn? On the face of it, food businesses are commanding fancy prices - after all, Nabisco and Danone, the US and French food groups, have been slugging it out to buy United Biscuits. But UB has a collection of well-established brands and a valuable position as Britain's best-known biscuit maker, albeit in a mature and fiercely competitive market. </p> <p>RHM may be Britain's biggest breadmaker, but there the similarities end. There is no baking equivalent of Nabisco, keen to create an international bread empire. While Hovis may be the strongest bread brand, it does not carry the weight of McVities. Others, such as Mr Kipling, or Bisto, are niche markets rather than mainstream brands. </p> <p>Rather than making comparisons with the battle for UB, it may be more appropriate to look at the value of RHM's baking rival, Associated British Foods. Merrill's Rennardson estimates that its baking business stands on a multiple of 10 times earnings. Applied to RHM, that would give a price tag of just \u00a3860 million, plus whatever debt Tomkins attaches to it. </p> <p>A few months ago, ABF was trading on 13 times earnings but, even at that multiple, RHM would still fetch just \u00a31.1bn - some way short of the target. The decline in ABF's rating reflects the fierceness with which the big supermarket groups are squeezing prices, and therefore bakers' profits. RHM will not be immune to that. </p> <p>Such price pressures were clear in the interim figures. Sales declined by 4 per cent, operating profit was down 12.7 per cent and margins dipped from 7.5 to 6.8 per cent. True, about half of the fall was due to one-off restructuring costs but it is easier to command fancy prices when profits are rising. </p> <p>Elsewhere at Tomkins, that was the case - overall, operating profit was 3 per cent higher, and earnings per share, courtesy of last year's share buy-back, were 13 per cent ahead. Chairman Greg Hutchings could not resist another moan about the City's refusal to recognise Tomkins' value creation: earnings and dividends have grown by at least 15 per cent every year since 1983. </p> <p>The question is, can that be sustained? Tomkins' two main markets after food has gone are construction and automotive in the US, both vulnerable to a slowdown. Its businesses are not high-tech enough to command fancy prices, so it is at the mercy of cost-conscious customers. If the food business does raise \u00a31.75bn, Hutchings still has to find somewhere to put it - and many of its targets face the same problems as its existing business. A prospective multiple of less than 10 looks mean for the growth record but, barring a dramatic shift in City priorities, it is unlikely to go any higher. </p> <p><strong> Play safe</strong></p> <p>Safeway calls it the Carlos effect but, in truth, it is far too early to give the new chief executive full credit for the 6.1 per cent rise in like-for-like sales at the supermarket group in the 12 weeks to 8 January. It is also far too early to say whether such rises can be sustained for long enough to get Safeway back into a credible position in the supermarket wars. </p> <p>Certainly, initiatives such as making huge cuts in the price of some products - and making sure they were on the shelves when customers got there - has been attracting shoppers. Nor does it seem to be just a case of taking advantage of the weak - Safeway says that it has been winning market share from all its rivals, not just the beleaguered Sainsbury's. </p> <p>The figures suggest that Safeway is at last starting to turn the corner. But Asda (with Wal-Mart behind it) and Tesco are formidable competitors and, following its shake-up, Sainsbury may become one again. Take advantage of the bargains to be had on Safeway's shelves, but stay away from its shares. </p> <p><strong> In concrete </strong></p> <p>A flurry of positive trading statements from building materials companies proves that the recent recovery in prices in the sector, after a bleak autumn, was justified. It does look as if volumes of aggregates, cement and concrete will rise in Britain this year, albeit modestly; Goldilocks has yet to be frightened away by the bears in the US, and even Germany seems at last to be on an upward trend. </p> <p>It is this latter market that makes RMC, Britain's biggest concrete producer, look interesting. Finance director Bob Lambourne is anxious that no one get too excited about Teutonic prospects, warning that the East is likely to fall still further and that the recovery in the West is not that well established. But, given how pessimistic analysts were, anything vaguely positive is good news. </p> <p>Add in the potential from integrating Rugby Group, the acquisition of which was completed last Monday, and RMC looks more attractive still. Much has been made of the fact that the deal will make RMC the first company in Britain to own major suppliers of cement and of concrete, the latter being the biggest user of cement. But, given the inherent conservatism of RMC, it would be rash to predict that it will do anything to exploit its position, at least in the short term. It certainly would not want to upset the market before it is clear what Anglo American, which has just bought aggregates group Tarmac, will do with its existing small cement interest. </p> <p>RMC should find plenty in Rugby to boost its profits without fiddling with the markets - including \u00a320m of cost savings by the end of next year. That should be enough to keep RMC's shares moving. Buy.</p>",

Nor does it seem to be just a case of taking advantage of the weak - Safeway says that it has been winning market share from all its rivals, not just the beleaguered Sainsbury's. The figures suggest that Safeway is at last starting to turn the corner. But Asda (with Wal-Mart behind it) and Tesco are formidable competitors and, following its shake-up, Sainsbury may become one again. Take advantage of the bargains to be had on Safeway's shelves, but stay away from its shares. In concrete A flurry of positive trading statements from building materials companies proves that the recent recovery in prices in the sector, after a bleak autumn, was justified. It does look as if volumes of aggregates, cement and concrete will rise in Britain this year, albeit modestly; Goldilocks has yet to be frightened away by the bears in the US, and even Germany seems at last to be on an upward trend. It is this latter market that makes RMC, Britain's biggest concrete producer, look interesting. Finance director Bob Lambourne is anxious that no one get too excited about Teutonic prospects, warning that the East is likely to fall still further and that the recovery in the West is not that well established. But, given how pessimistic analysts were, anything vaguely positive is good news. Add in the potential from integrating Rugby Group, the acquisition of which was completed last Monday, and RMC looks more attractive still. Much has been made of the fact that the deal will make RMC the first company in Britain to own major suppliers of cement and of concrete, the latter being the biggest user of cement. But, given the inherent conservatism of RMC, it would be rash to predict that it will do anything to exploit its position, at least in the short term. It certainly would not want to upset the market before it is clear what Anglo American, which has just bought aggregates group Tarmac, will do with its existing small cement interest. RMC should find plenty in Rugby to boost its profits without fiddling with the markets - including \u00a320m of cost savings by the end of next year. That should be enough to keep RMC's shares moving. Buy.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Internet frenzy has been in full swing for more than a year now, but what is Internet paper worth as a currency? </p> <p>Its value was put to the test last week both in the US, with the AOL acquisition of Time Warner, and in the UK, with a \u00a346 million bid by Internet start-up freecom.net for the Pegasus software company. </p> <p>Both involve bidders with large ambitions and small - or no - profits, which are using their shares to buy real assets: in AOL's case a portfolio of entertainment assets; in freecom's case, a respected accounting software package. </p> <p>Both bids suggest that there is some doubt in investment bankers' minds about how investors will react to swapping an actual business for a virtual one. AOL offered a massive 70 per cent premium to Time's share price, freecom.net almost 50 per cent more than a rival cash offer for Pegasus. In normal bids, a 20 per cent premium would be seen as generous. </p> <p>The market's reaction suggests that the doubts were justified. Time's shares are now about 20 per cent below the peak they reached when the deal was announced, while AOL's have fallen by almost 12 per cent. </p> <p>But at least AOL has an established business, with 20 million subscribers, revenue of $4.8 billion, and earnings of $1bn. (Though Time, of course, earns more than five times as much). </p> <p>One investor summed up the paradox of the freecom deal: 'Freecom.net has 200 customers, \u00a3600,000 of revenues and has been going for less than a year. Pegasus has 50,000 customers, 30,000 of whom pay an annual fee. It owns its software; freecom doesn't. It is absurd. It's madness.' </p> <p>Shares in Pegasus have jumped by more than 10 per cent since the bid, and freecom's have held their value, but that probably reflects the fact that Solution 6, the Australian rival offering 430p a share for Pegasus, will be forced to increase its bid. </p> <p>Solution 6 seems, for the moment, happy to wait - after all, who knows what will happen to Internet shares during the 60-day course of the bid? As one of those involved in the deal said: 'Freecom could just as easily be worth 228p as 338p.' </p> <p>That is the key issue with Internet currency: who can say what it is worth? Freecom's shares have trebled since it floated on the alternative investment market and its business plan, to offer an Internet service to small companies, looks sensible. But no one can gauge how successful it will be. </p> <p>Talks between the two companies started last summer, when freecom approached Pegasus with a view to selling itself to the software group. Under those proposals, Pegasus shareholders would have ended up with around 75 per cent of the enlarged group. Freecom decided demand for Internet shares was so high that it should list instead. It was right: its offer would give Pegasus shareholders less than 30 per cent of the enlarged group. </p> <p>It is easy to see why freecom is keen on Pegasus - if nothing else, it should offer some protection from any shake-out in Internet shares. But Pegasus' shareholders may care to remember the fable of the emperor's new clothes. The emperor may have managed to get his citizens to admire his new suit but would any of them have bought the trousers?</p> <p><strong>So who will be the nest Steve Case?</strong></p> <p>STEVE BALLMER, 42, was late last week appointed Microsoft chief executive officer, replacing the company's founder Bill Gates. Described as brilliant and energetic, Ballmer, Microsoft's former marketing guru, has a degree from Harvard in maths and economics, and started out at Procter &amp; Gamble before taking a course at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. </p> <p>JEFF BEZOS, 35, founder and chief executive of Amazon.com, is a computer genius. Soon after graduating from Princeton, he redesigned computer systems for Bankers Trust, and became the company's youngest vice-president. Amazon, which he founded in 1994, is being transformed into an online mall, and will probably soon offer services such as video- on-demand and music. </p> <p>JAMES MURDOCH, 27, son of Rupert and the man charged with developing News Corporation's new media strategy. Murdoch dropped out of college to set up his own record company, Rawkus Entertainment, and is keen to develop News Corp's music interests as well as its content library. </p> <p>JERRY YANG, 30, founded Yahoo!, the Internet search engine and portal site, in April 1994 with fellow Stanford engineering student David Filo. The pair initially designed Yahoo! to help find their way around the Internet. Yang and Filo hold stakes worth around $3bn each in the company, which they are keen to keep independent.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Internet frenzy has been in full swing for more than a year now, but what is Internet paper worth as a currency? Its value was put to the test last week both in the US, with the AOL acquisition of Time Warner, and in the UK, with a \u00a346 million bid by Internet start-up freecom.net for the Pegasus software company. Both involve bidders with large ambitions and small - or no - profits, which are using their shares to buy real assets: in AOL's case a portfolio of entertainment assets; in freecom's case, a respected accounting software package. Both bids suggest that there is some doubt in investment bankers' minds about how investors will react to swapping an actual business for a virtual one. AOL offered a massive 70 per cent premium to Time's share price, freecom.net almost 50 per cent more than a rival cash offer for Pegasus. In normal bids, a 20 per cent premium would be seen as generous. The market's reaction suggests that the doubts were justified. Time's shares are now about 20 per cent below the peak they reached when the deal was announced, while AOL's have fallen by almost 12 per cent. But at least AOL has an established business, with 20 million subscribers, revenue of $4.8 billion, and earnings of $1bn. (Though Time, of course, earns more than five times as much). One investor summed up the paradox of the freecom deal: 'Freecom.net has 200 customers, \u00a3600,000 of revenues and has been going for less than a year. Pegasus has 50,000 customers, 30,000 of whom pay an annual fee. It owns its software; freecom doesn't. It is absurd. It's madness.' Shares in Pegasus have jumped by more than 10 per cent since the bid, and freecom's have held their value, but that probably reflects the fact that Solution 6, the Australian rival offering 430p a share for Pegasus, will be forced to increase its bid. Solution 6 seems, for the moment, happy to wait - after all, who knows what will happen to Internet shares during the 60-day course of the bid? As one of those involved in the deal said: 'Freecom could just as easily be worth 228p as 338p.' That is the key issue with Internet currency: who can say what it is worth? Freecom's shares have trebled since it floated on the alternative investment market and its business plan, to offer an Internet service to small companies, looks sensible. But no one can gauge how successful it will be. Talks between the two companies started last summer, when freecom approached Pegasus with a view to selling itself to the software group. Under those proposals, Pegasus shareholders would have ended up with around 75 per cent of the enlarged group. Freecom decided demand for Internet shares was so high that it should list instead. It was right: its offer would give Pegasus shareholders less than 30 per cent of the enlarged group. It is easy to see why freecom is keen on Pegasus - if nothing else, it should offer some protection from any shake-out in Internet shares. But Pegasus' shareholders may care to remember the fable of the emperor's new clothes. The emperor may have managed to get his citizens to admire his new suit but would any of them have bought the trousers? So who will be the nest Steve Case? STEVE BALLMER, 42, was late last week appointed Microsoft chief executive officer, replacing the company's founder Bill Gates. Described as brilliant and energetic, Ballmer, Microsoft's former marketing guru, has a degree from Harvard in maths and economics, and started out at Procter &amp; Gamble before taking a course at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. JEFF BEZOS, 35, founder and chief executive of Amazon.com, is a computer genius. Soon after graduating from Princeton, he redesigned computer systems for Bankers Trust, and became the company's youngest vice-president. Amazon, which he founded in 1994, is being transformed into an online mall, and will probably soon offer services such as video- on-demand and music. JAMES MURDOCH, 27, son of Rupert and the man charged with developing News Corporation's new media strategy. Murdoch dropped out of college to set up his own record company, Rawkus Entertainment, and is keen to develop News Corp's music interests as well as its content library. JERRY YANG, 30, founded Yahoo!, the Internet search engine and portal site, in April 1994 with fellow Stanford engineering student David Filo. The pair initially designed Yahoo! to help find their way around the Internet. Yang and Filo hold stakes worth around $3bn each in the company, which they are keen to keep independent.",

      "body": "<p>First we had IQ tests, then we talked about Emotional Intelligence (EQ), and now we are on the verge of discussing Spiritual Intelligence (SQ). Sceptics dismiss such concepts as ways for management consultants to make large fees. But the ideas will not go away - and demand for training courses, workshops and other offerings will continue to rise during 2000. </p> <p>The development of ideas such as EQ and SQ offers clues to the ways in which we are using different parts of our selves in the workplace. Until the Second World War, most workers were involved in manual work, so even IQ tests were ahead of the game: the part that mattered was your body. The mind then became more valued as technology meant that more people worked in offices. In the 90s, another giant step was taken when employers began to realise that your ability to negotiate your way successfully with colleagues and clients was probably far more important in most jobs than the fact that you had a First in history. </p> <p>This was called Emotional Intelligence: your ability to understand your own emotions, to empathise with others and to behave appropriately - although, of course, we all know circumstances in which a good but unscrupulous negotiator has made conditions for others worse, if not actually damaged the company's bottom line. </p> <p>SQ goes a step further. Its proponents argue that the most important quality is your passion or commitment - evidenced, perhaps, by a traditional religious belief, but also by your own private desires, your love of your family and friends, and your commitment to whatever belief system you have. 'You can be spiritually wealthy and be an atheist,' says Danah Zohar, an American-born, British-based physicist and philosopher who, with her husband and co-author Ian Marshall, created the term SQ. </p> <p>On 1 February, SQ - The Ultimate Intelligence is published by Bloomsbury - the same day that the Cranfield School of Management stages a one-day course on the subject. We are likely to hear a lot more of Zohar and her ideas in the coming year. </p> <p>'The search for meaning, vision and value is the most important aspect of being human,' she says. 'Dogs and cats have some emotional intelligence, but they don't have SQ. If you have a high SQ, you will become much more productive. There is so much sleeping talent among ordinary workers because managers just assume that they are idiots and machines.' </p> <p>Companies will become less afraid of constructive mavericks, she believes: too many of them have recruited too many yes-men, who do not ask questions or think independently. </p> <p>Zohar and Marshall's ideas chime with many other studies: the Institute of Directors' survey of leadership qualities, which highlighted enthusiasm as the most important one; the recent research that discovered greater well-being among people who pray; and the growing belief that happier workers are also the most effective ones. </p> <p>Harnessing your vision, controlling your own career and expanding your horizons are all themes being taught by workplace motivation experts. MindStore - a Glasgow-based company promoting self-development courses - saw a fivefold increase in demand for workplace talks by its founder, Jack Black, in the last few months of 1999. </p> <p>'Most people are performing way below their effectiveness levels, in some cases as much as 50 per cent below,' he says. 'But when people fulfil themselves, it is far more enjoyable to go to work, and they enjoy their personal lives more.' </p> <p>He believes that widespread satisfaction is now possible in the workplace - and even attainable in the next five years 'if work becomes something really enjoyable and meaningful.' </p> <p>The keys to his approach include setting ambitious goals, focusing hard on ways of achieving them, pushing yourself forward by being positive and believing you will succeed, highlighting the challenges you face, taking in constructive criticism and then moving on. </p> <p>Sue Knight, author of the Institute of Personnel and Development's book Introducing Neuro-Linguistic Programming , has seen in the past two years a 'phenomenal growth' in interest in NLP - a method, used by MindStore, that encourages people to become more positive in outlook by imagining themselves succeeding and by dropping negativity from their speech and thoughts. (Instead of saying 'I'll try to do X', you say 'I will do X'). So if, for instance, you hate your current job but do not know what would really satisfy you, Knight has this advice to offer: 'The questions we ask of ourselves have a big influence on our unconscious mind. If you ask \"Why am I unhappy?\" you are sending your subconscious on a search for problems. But if you ask: \"What unique skills do I have? What do I really want?\" you will start to find out what your unique characteristics are.' </p> <p>You're not convinced? You think unbridled enthusiasm will leave you at best sounding silly, at worst failing to live up to your promises. But, as SQ's promoters would point out, the only part of the world you can be sure of changing is yourself. </p> <p><strong>Psyched up but not stressed out</strong></p> <p>Want to improve the quality of your life? If so, work on minimising the negative effects of any stress at work. You will end up having fewer painful altercations with colleagues, you will feel physically better, and your life outside work will be happier. </p> <p>Bringing home your workplace bad temper and problems is also likely to depress your partner - male partners are particularly likely to feel anxious at hearing reports of their partner's bad day, according to research published by the University of Hertfordshire earlier this month. </p> <p>So what are the first things you should do? </p> <p>'We encourage people to relax their mind and their body for three to five minutes before meetings,' says MindStore's Jack Black. 'You can release some of the tension you have built up and clear your vision to deal with new issues. You will become more open-minded and less aggressive.' </p> <p><strong>No truck with suspicion and mistrust</strong></p> <p>If you are a traditionalist, you will think that far too much is claimed for the new management techniques. You may feel that people with real ability and discipline will be able to get the best from themselves without being nannied. </p> <p>But John Oliver, former chief executive of Leyland Trucks in Lancashire, would disagree with you. </p> <p>'Back in 1989, Leyland Trucks had a sad history of decline. So we developed the concept of \"team enterprise\" as a way of improving the empathy of the average employee, so that they would come to work with a sense of excitement rather than drudgery. </p> <p>'The aim was to empower people by working towards mutually beneficial objectives. From 1989 to 1996 we had phenomenal success: while our parent company went into receivership, we had a buyout and became increasingly profitable. </p> <p>'But we were a 100-year-old company with a background of suspicion and mistrust. We wanted to do something more. We wanted to start a stress management programme. Jack Black [of MindStore] came to speak to us in September 1996. We persuaded and cajoled about 300 of our workers [out of 700] and their partners to attend. Afterwards we were picking people off the ceiling. The effect was wonderful: it created an energy in the organisation which transformed even the language we used. </p> <p>'There are lots of personal anecdotes about how it helped people. One person managed to get control of his angina. We were eventually taken over by the American company Paccar - and the \"team enterprise\" initiative was an important part of that. </p> <p>'In 1989, we spent \u00a330,000 on team enterprise - and then saved \u00a310 million a year. We reduced the breakeven point from 11,500 to 5,500 trucks. Profits went from non-existent to \u00a315m in 1998. In 1989, we had zero ideas per employee per year. Now we have an average of 22 ideas per employee.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "First we had IQ tests, then we talked about Emotional Intelligence (EQ), and now we are on the verge of discussing Spiritual Intelligence (SQ). Sceptics dismiss such concepts as ways for management consultants to make large fees. But the ideas will not go away - and demand for training courses, workshops and other offerings will continue to rise during 2000. The development of ideas such as EQ and SQ offers clues to the ways in which we are using different parts of our selves in the workplace. Until the Second World War, most workers were involved in manual work, so even IQ tests were ahead of the game: the part that mattered was your body. The mind then became more valued as technology meant that more people worked in offices. In the 90s, another giant step was taken when employers began to realise that your ability to negotiate your way successfully with colleagues and clients was probably far more important in most jobs than the fact that you had a First in history. This was called Emotional Intelligence: your ability to understand your own emotions, to empathise with others and to behave appropriately - although, of course, we all know circumstances in which a good but unscrupulous negotiator has made conditions for others worse, if not actually damaged the company's bottom line. SQ goes a step further. Its proponents argue that the most important quality is your passion or commitment - evidenced, perhaps, by a traditional religious belief, but also by your own private desires, your love of your family and friends, and your commitment to whatever belief system you have. 'You can be spiritually wealthy and be an atheist,' says Danah Zohar, an American-born, British-based physicist and philosopher who, with her husband and co-author Ian Marshall, created the term SQ. On 1 February, SQ - The Ultimate Intelligence is published by Bloomsbury - the same day that the Cranfield School of Management stages a one-day course on the subject. We are likely to hear a lot more of Zohar and her ideas in the coming year. 'The search for meaning, vision and value is the most important aspect of being human,' she says. 'Dogs and cats have some emotional intelligence, but they don't have SQ. If you have a high SQ, you will become much more productive. There is so much sleeping talent among ordinary workers because managers just assume that they are idiots and machines.' Companies will become less afraid of constructive mavericks, she believes: too many of them have recruited too many yes-men, who do not ask questions or think independently. Zohar and Marshall's ideas chime with many other studies: the Institute of Directors' survey of leadership qualities, which highlighted enthusiasm as the most important one; the recent research that discovered greater well-being among people who pray; and the growing belief that happier workers are also the most effective ones. Harnessing your vision, controlling your own career and expanding your horizons are all themes being taught by workplace motivation experts. MindStore - a Glasgow-based company promoting self-development courses - saw a fivefold increase in demand for workplace talks by its founder, Jack Black, in the last few months of 1999. 'Most people are performing way below their effectiveness levels, in some cases as much as 50 per cent below,' he says. 'But when people fulfil themselves, it is far more enjoyable to go to work, and they enjoy their personal lives more.' He believes that widespread satisfaction is now possible in the workplace - and even attainable in the next five years 'if work becomes something really enjoyable and meaningful.' The keys to his approach include setting ambitious goals, focusing hard on ways of achieving them, pushing yourself forward by being positive and believing you will succeed, highlighting the challenges you face, taking in constructive criticism and then moving on. Sue Knight, author of the Institute of Personnel and Development's book Introducing Neuro-Linguistic Programming , has seen in the past two years a 'phenomenal growth' in interest in NLP - a method, used by MindStore, that encourages people to become more positive in outlook by imagining themselves succeeding and by dropping negativity from their speech and thoughts. (Instead of saying 'I'll try to do X', you say 'I will do X'). So if, for instance, you hate your current job but do not know what would really satisfy you, Knight has this advice to offer: 'The questions we ask of ourselves have a big influence on our unconscious mind. If you ask \"Why am I unhappy?\" you are sending your subconscious on a search for problems. But if you ask: \"What unique skills do I have? What do I really want?\" you will start to find out what your unique characteristics are.' You're not convinced? You think unbridled enthusiasm will leave you at best sounding silly, at worst failing to live up to your promises. But, as SQ's promoters would point out, the only part of the world you can be sure of changing is yourself. Psyched up but not stressed out Want to improve the quality of your life? If so, work on minimising the negative effects of any stress at work. You will end up having fewer painful altercations with colleagues, you will feel physically better, and your life outside work will be happier. Bringing home your workplace bad temper and problems is also likely to depress your partner - male partners are particularly likely to feel anxious at hearing reports of their partner's bad day, according to research published by the University of Hertfordshire earlier this month. So what are the first things you should do? 'We encourage people to relax their mind and their body for three to five minutes before meetings,' says MindStore's Jack Black. 'You can release some of the tension you have built up and clear your vision to deal with new issues. You will become more open-minded and less aggressive.' No truck with suspicion and mistrust If you are a traditionalist, you will think that far too much is claimed for the new management techniques. You may feel that people with real ability and discipline will be able to get the best from themselves without being nannied. But John Oliver, former chief executive of Leyland Trucks in Lancashire, would disagree with you. 'Back in 1989, Leyland Trucks had a sad history of decline. So we developed the concept of \"team enterprise\" as a way of improving the empathy of the average employee, so that they would come to work with a sense of excitement rather than drudgery. 'The aim was to empower people by working towards mutually beneficial objectives. From 1989 to 1996 we had phenomenal success: while our parent company went into receivership, we had a buyout and became increasingly profitable. 'But we were a 100-year-old company with a background of suspicion and mistrust. We wanted to do something more. We wanted to start a stress management programme. Jack Black [of MindStore] came to speak to us in September 1996. We persuaded and cajoled about 300 of our workers [out of 700] and their partners to attend. Afterwards we were picking people off the ceiling. The effect was wonderful: it created an energy in the organisation which transformed even the language we used. 'There are lots of personal anecdotes about how it helped people. One person managed to get control of his angina. We were eventually taken over by the American company Paccar - and the \"team enterprise\" initiative was an important part of that. 'In 1989, we spent \u00a330,000 on team enterprise - and then saved \u00a310 million a year. We reduced the breakeven point from 11,500 to 5,500 trucks. Profits went from non-existent to \u00a315m in 1998. In 1989, we had zero ideas per employee per year. Now we have an average of 22 ideas per employee.'",

      "body": "<p>The Rhiga is a smart Manhattan hotel, hardly on a par with the Four Seasons or the Mercer for flash and brash, but clubby, exclusive and an all-suite affair to boot. So when Steve Case phoned Gerry Levin in October to suggest that his company, America Online, should do business with Levin's Time Warner, the Rhiga seemed the perfect, discreet venue. </p> <p>Three months later the two men were standing together on a platform in front of the world and describing how they had pulled off the biggest merger in history. </p> <p>Last Monday, amid the popping flashbulbs and TV cameras - many of which belonged to media outlets now wrapped into this historic $337 billion deal - Levin was the one in the sports coat and slacks while AOL's Case was, unusually for a new media tycoon, soberly attired. This offered 57-year old Levin the opportunity to quip that he was 'welcoming the suits from Virginia', to a ripple of sycophantic laughter. </p> <p>Case could afford a smile. Not only was the 41-year-old sitting on options worth up to $750 million, he was also taking charge of properties including Time Magazine, Warner Bros films and record labels, and even cable news channel CNN. </p> <p>Some of the Time Warner executives may have squirmed uncomfortably when they remembered how they treated Case as something of a joke when he used to work media trade fairs, asking anyone who would listen and anyone with a scrap of content whether they would consider his rather unfashionable online service as a vehicle for their brands. More often than not, the answer was 'no'. </p> <p>Looming large at the press conference was Time Warner's other figurehead, Ted Turner, the man who only a week earlier had been splashed across every US newspaper for his separation from wife Jane Fonda. Clearly marital matters were still on Turner's mind as he enthused about the unprecedented merger between the old and the new media: he said he approached the business with the same enthusiasm and trepidation 'as I did when I first made love to a woman some 42-years ago'. Cue more delighted laughter from the press benches. </p> <p>Throughout the day the pavement outside Time Warner's monolithic headquarters remained lined with TV cameras. In America, where business is always big news and Net business is the biggest, this was the biggest thing anyone could imagine happening. </p> <p>In CNN's studios, the influential Moneyline programme struggled to stay on the right side of hyperbole - and failed. Three of Wall Street's most influential analysts enthused about the transformative nature of the deal, breathlessly declaring it the true dawn of a new age. Asked to sum up the deal, Jessica Reif Cohen, chief media analyst at Merrill Lynch, just said: 'Wow!' </p> <p>Rendering speechless analysts who are paid millions of dollars a year to understand the fast unravelling communications market was the first trick of the AOL/Time Warner deal. But as the sun rose over Wall Street on day two of the biggest merger in the world, a little cold reality was beginning to creep into the picture. </p> <p>Shares in both companies dropped throughout the day as America's finest financial minds struggled with the ugly question: 'How much is it worth?' Shares continued to fall throughout the week: AOL was falling back because, said some: 'The market doesn't like the fact that it is no longer a pure Internet player - that it has suddenly taken on board all these crummy overheads associated with \"old\" business.'

      "bodyText": "The Rhiga is a smart Manhattan hotel, hardly on a par with the Four Seasons or the Mercer for flash and brash, but clubby, exclusive and an all-suite affair to boot. So when Steve Case phoned Gerry Levin in October to suggest that his company, America Online, should do business with Levin's Time Warner, the Rhiga seemed the perfect, discreet venue. Three months later the two men were standing together on a platform in front of the world and describing how they had pulled off the biggest merger in history. Last Monday, amid the popping flashbulbs and TV cameras - many of which belonged to media outlets now wrapped into this historic $337 billion deal - Levin was the one in the sports coat and slacks while AOL's Case was, unusually for a new media tycoon, soberly attired. This offered 57-year old Levin the opportunity to quip that he was 'welcoming the suits from Virginia', to a ripple of sycophantic laughter. Case could afford a smile. Not only was the 41-year-old sitting on options worth up to $750 million, he was also taking charge of properties including Time Magazine, Warner Bros films and record labels, and even cable news channel CNN. Some of the Time Warner executives may have squirmed uncomfortably when they remembered how they treated Case as something of a joke when he used to work media trade fairs, asking anyone who would listen and anyone with a scrap of content whether they would consider his rather unfashionable online service as a vehicle for their brands. More often than not, the answer was 'no'. Looming large at the press conference was Time Warner's other figurehead, Ted Turner, the man who only a week earlier had been splashed across every US newspaper for his separation from wife Jane Fonda. Clearly marital matters were still on Turner's mind as he enthused about the unprecedented merger between the old and the new media: he said he approached the business with the same enthusiasm and trepidation 'as I did when I first made love to a woman some 42-years ago'. Cue more delighted laughter from the press benches. Throughout the day the pavement outside Time Warner's monolithic headquarters remained lined with TV cameras. In America, where business is always big news and Net business is the biggest, this was the biggest thing anyone could imagine happening. In CNN's studios, the influential Moneyline programme struggled to stay on the right side of hyperbole - and failed. Three of Wall Street's most influential analysts enthused about the transformative nature of the deal, breathlessly declaring it the true dawn of a new age. Asked to sum up the deal, Jessica Reif Cohen, chief media analyst at Merrill Lynch, just said: 'Wow!' Rendering speechless analysts who are paid millions of dollars a year to understand the fast unravelling communications market was the first trick of the AOL/Time Warner deal. But as the sun rose over Wall Street on day two of the biggest merger in the world, a little cold reality was beginning to creep into the picture. Shares in both companies dropped throughout the day as America's finest financial minds struggled with the ugly question: 'How much is it worth?' Shares continued to fall throughout the week: AOL was falling back because, said some: 'The market doesn't like the fact that it is no longer a pure Internet player - that it has suddenly taken on board all these crummy overheads associated with \"old\" business.' The sheer size of the deal meant this readjustment took about \u00a316bn off its value. To give some idea of scale, this is like a company the size of BSkyB completely disappearing. Most of Wall Street had realised what Steve Case had worked out many months earlier: that at some point the ambitious valuations of the Internet were going to have to come down and meet reality. Before that could happen, Case beat his contemporaries by transferring some of that hypothecated value into something real. AOL had managed to secure 55 per cent of the merged company, even though its profits and turnover were a fraction of Time Warner's. By last Thursday, the financial community had adjusted the price of shares in AOL and Time Warner to a level that reflected a fair valuation. Much more slippage and the whole deal could be in trouble. Despite the fact that AOL is that rare thing - an Inter net company that makes money - the size of the respective organisations is still massively disproportionate. Time Warner has 67,000 employees; AOL has 12,000. Time Warner has a turnover of over $26bn; AOL's is just over $5bn. Profits at AOL are $500m; at Time Warner they are $1.19bn. Yet AOL will rule the roost: while Levin remains as chief executive, the man tipped for the top is Bob Pittman, AOL's chief operating officer and Case's right-hand man. He was also one of the founders of MTV - so he's the complete new media man. But is the AOL/Time Warner deal as significant as the brouhaha suggests? After all, when Time and Warner lumped themselves together in 1989 on the mistaken grounds that cross-media ownership was the way of the future, it took them nearly a decade to recover culturally from the decision. Is this just a repeat performance? One indisputable fact about the AOL deal is that it proves the Internet is the fastest maturing business ever. It also proves, for those who were in any doubt about it at all, that content is not king, as we were told for the first five years of the Nineties. In fact, distribution is king - and distribution plus content are emperor. This may seem far removed from media and communications in Europe. It will not affect the Warner-produced content we consume over here - from the Cartoon Network to The Sopranos and reruns of Larry Sanders. Nor will it have an impact on many Internet users over here - of AOL's 26 million subscribers worldwide, 20 million are in the US. Of the rest, slightly over 2 million subscribe to Compuserve, and a further 3 million-plus belong to AOL Europe - a joint venture with Bertelsmann. No, the really big effect of the merger is to accelerate what we already knew was happening - that distribution platforms of all media are converging. It also reminds us that if Rupert Murdoch was minded to sell News Corporation - which he isn't - and Yahoo! was minded to buy it - which it isn't - such a deal would be perfectly feasible. Does this mean, as US economist Paul Krugman suggests, that the Internet is about to stop being a liberated open system and start being a boring toll-oper ated domain for subscribers only? Case is clearly banking on this scenario, which would make the deal a blow for the Net purists but a fillip for traditional media companies - awed by the power of the Net but scared by its anarchic lack of revenue streams. What is certain is that before the deal there was no unifying factor between Time magazine and HBO, the cable channel - but through AOL there will be. In other words, the Internet can easily replace broadcasting as a way of distributing television programmes. Time Warner, as the second-largest cable operator in the US, may find this doubly useful, as cable delivery of Internet services is now widely believed to be 'the future'. The types of capability that come from a broadband network mean that those slow, clunky Internet connections will be a thing of the past. AOL/Time Warner doesn't really represent something new - instead it means that the convergence of television sets and computers has come another step closer, and when it happens, the new company ought to be at the front of the pack.
