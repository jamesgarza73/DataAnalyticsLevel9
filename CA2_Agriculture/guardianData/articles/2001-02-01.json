      "body": "<p>Three players were sent off here last night as Manchester United extended their lead at the top of the Premiership to 15 points, courtesy of a controversial goal from Andy Cole in the opening minute of the second half. </p> <p> Sunderland argued, not without reason, that Cole had handled and Michael Gray was dismissed for dissent. Soon after this Cole and Alex Rae were sent off following an exchange of blows in the Sunderland goalmouth and ultimately only a frozen female streaker brightened Wearside's evening.</p> <p> This time Sunderland's has been a longer haul to a position of high esteem. Whereas last season Peter Reid's side, newly promoted from the Nationwide League, rose like rockets only to fall like sticks they now look like maintaining their challenge for a Champions League place a little longer. </p> <p> Not that the most optimistic Wearsider would have suspected as much last September, when after a 3-0 defeat at Old Trafford Sunderland lay in the bottom three. </p> <p> Before last night, however, they had lost only twice in 19 league matches and another encounter with United offered them a chance to remind the champions of just how dramatic the improvement has been. For Sunderland there was also the practical necessity of victory to leapfrog back above Arsenal into second place. </p> <p> Of course Reid's team had already knocked United out of the Worthington Cup this season but that night they were playing Sir Alex Ferguson's reserves. In fact the ease with which United's youngsters passed the ball around was a poor augury for Sunderland's hopes of holding the real thing. </p> <p> As ever they looked to Niall Quinn's power in the air complementing the goalscoring instincts of Kevin Phillips. In the fourth minute a high ball from Jody Craddock skimmed Quinn's head and fell to Phillips at the far post. His shot was off target but the most likely threat to United's defence had quickly made itself apparent. </p> <p> United's most recent conquerors, Liverpool in the league and West Ham in the FA Cup, had relied on outwitting them at their own passing game but Sunderland were always more likely to prefer the broadsword to the rapier. </p> <p> After 10 minutes Gray's low cross might have seen Sunderland score had Quinn been a fraction further forward in the goalmouth. With Don Hutchison pushing up on the right and Gavin McCann and Stefan Schwarz pressing forward to support the front men, United's early attacking pressure soon gave way to containment punctuated by quick, economical breakaways. As Giggs steadily gnawed away at the Sunderland right so United began to take the heat and passion out of the evening. </p> <p> The loss of Quinn with a shoulder injury on the half-hour did nothing for Sunderland's hopes of reimposing themselves. How they could have done with the suspended Danny Dichio, the usual alternative to Quinn, at that point. </p> <p> By half-time, with Roy Keane and Paul Scholes dominant in midfield, United were controlling the tempo and pattern of the game. Half-chances fell to Keane and Teddy Sheringham (twice) which, while they failed to produce a goal, left little doubt about which team was the more likely to score. </p> <p> Not that any such doubts lasted long into the second half, about half-a-minute in fact. A defensive muddle allowed Keane to send Cole clear with a short lob. Cole duly chipped the ball past Thomas Sorensen but appeared to handle it first. </p> <p> When Graham Poll allowed the goal to stand Sunderland's fury erupted on and off the pitch. In the end Gray protested too much and got himself needlessly sent off when Sunderland more than ever needed to be up to strength. </p> <p> In the event they were soon down to nine men. After 56 minutes Rae followed Gray, along with Cole, following a dust-up after the United striker had made a strong challenge on Sorensen. </p> <p> Three dismissals is about par for the course for Poll, who had flourished a similar number of red cards in the Arsenal-Liverpool match last August. Undaunted, Sunderland would have drawn level had Jaap Stam not got back to block a shot from Kevin Kilbane which had beaten Fabien Barthez.</p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

As ever they looked to Niall Quinn's power in the air complementing the goalscoring instincts of Kevin Phillips. In the fourth minute a high ball from Jody Craddock skimmed Quinn's head and fell to Phillips at the far post. His shot was off target but the most likely threat to United's defence had quickly made itself apparent. United's most recent conquerors, Liverpool in the league and West Ham in the FA Cup, had relied on outwitting them at their own passing game but Sunderland were always more likely to prefer the broadsword to the rapier. After 10 minutes Gray's low cross might have seen Sunderland score had Quinn been a fraction further forward in the goalmouth. With Don Hutchison pushing up on the right and Gavin McCann and Stefan Schwarz pressing forward to support the front men, United's early attacking pressure soon gave way to containment punctuated by quick, economical breakaways. As Giggs steadily gnawed away at the Sunderland right so United began to take the heat and passion out of the evening. The loss of Quinn with a shoulder injury on the half-hour did nothing for Sunderland's hopes of reimposing themselves. How they could have done with the suspended Danny Dichio, the usual alternative to Quinn, at that point. By half-time, with Roy Keane and Paul Scholes dominant in midfield, United were controlling the tempo and pattern of the game. Half-chances fell to Keane and Teddy Sheringham (twice) which, while they failed to produce a goal, left little doubt about which team was the more likely to score. Not that any such doubts lasted long into the second half, about half-a-minute in fact. A defensive muddle allowed Keane to send Cole clear with a short lob. Cole duly chipped the ball past Thomas Sorensen but appeared to handle it first. When Graham Poll allowed the goal to stand Sunderland's fury erupted on and off the pitch. In the end Gray protested too much and got himself needlessly sent off when Sunderland more than ever needed to be up to strength. In the event they were soon down to nine men. After 56 minutes Rae followed Gray, along with Cole, following a dust-up after the United striker had made a strong challenge on Sorensen. Three dismissals is about par for the course for Poll, who had flourished a similar number of red cards in the Arsenal-Liverpool match last August. Undaunted, Sunderland would have drawn level had Jaap Stam not got back to block a shot from Kevin Kilbane which had beaten Fabien Barthez. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Claudio Ranieri again rang the changes last night but there remains one constant in this resurgent Chelsea. Gianfranco Zola's continuing excellence, typified by his wonderful equaliser, constructed the platform for his side's domination of the second half, which was rounded off with eye-catching goals by Gustavo Poyet and Jesper Gronkjaer. </p> <p>The Italian's goal - his tenth of the season - and Poyet's speak of renewed confidence at the Bridge, which was underlined by Gronkjaer's emphatic strike 11 minutes from time. Europe may yet welcome Chelsea again next season. </p> <p>United had the best of the opening exchanges, though. The two-game suspension for Kieron Dyer, which happened to coincide with his shin injury, saw the spring-heeled midfielder back in vibrant health. His pace, deployed up front because of Newcastle's familiar shoal of strikers' injuries, troubled Chelsea even before he created the opener. </p> <p>It came when Nol Solano dispossessed Celestine Babayaro and fired a canny pass up the right flank. Dyer took possession, ran on, took one look at the non-departing Frank Leboeuf and sped past him to the byline before crossing. </p> <p>The towering Shola Ameobi missed but the hovering Christian Bassedas did not, firing low to Carlo Cudicini's left. </p> <p>Ranieri, rarely slow to make a change, did so eight minutes later, his choice eased by the earlier sight of Graeme le Saux holding his thigh in discomfort. Gronkjaer took over the left wing-back role from the injury-plagued England man. </p> <p>Amid Chelsea's largely unconvincing early attacks, Zola's talent shone brightly. After 10 minutes he served warning by driving just wide after a delicious back-heel from Gustavo Poyet. Then the Italian and Uruguayan combined quickly and cleverly again, this time for Zola to loft a shot that was deflected for a fruitless corner. </p> <p>By now Zola was simmering and he came to the boil on 37 minutes when he received Babayaro's pass, cut inside and, despite facing four Newcastle shirts, half-turned and curled a superb shot from 22 yards past the hopelessly beaten Shay Given. </p> <p>Gronkjaer's surging runs down the left featured in Chelsea's early second-half attacks but it was the more thoughtful touches of Zola and Poyet that threatened to unhinge United who, despite a fair share of possession, rarely threatened Cudicini's goal. </p> <p>Chelsea pressure paid off on 62 minutes when Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink curled an inviting low cross into the area. Poyet reacted fractionally faster than the defenders, flicking the ball cleverly past Given. </p> <p>\u0095 Chelsea's chairman Ken Bates last night slated Monaco over the French transfer deadline-day collapse of Frank Leboeuf's proposed move home, for which a \u00a32.5m fee was agreed two weeks ago. \"To put it bluntly, Monaco can't come up with the money,\" said Bates. \"The situation is unresolved because their president has done a runner and is unavailable having interfered with and messed up the negotiations.\" </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "bodyText": "Claudio Ranieri again rang the changes last night but there remains one constant in this resurgent Chelsea. Gianfranco Zola's continuing excellence, typified by his wonderful equaliser, constructed the platform for his side's domination of the second half, which was rounded off with eye-catching goals by Gustavo Poyet and Jesper Gronkjaer. The Italian's goal - his tenth of the season - and Poyet's speak of renewed confidence at the Bridge, which was underlined by Gronkjaer's emphatic strike 11 minutes from time. Europe may yet welcome Chelsea again next season. United had the best of the opening exchanges, though. The two-game suspension for Kieron Dyer, which happened to coincide with his shin injury, saw the spring-heeled midfielder back in vibrant health. His pace, deployed up front because of Newcastle's familiar shoal of strikers' injuries, troubled Chelsea even before he created the opener. It came when Nol Solano dispossessed Celestine Babayaro and fired a canny pass up the right flank. Dyer took possession, ran on, took one look at the non-departing Frank Leboeuf and sped past him to the byline before crossing. The towering Shola Ameobi missed but the hovering Christian Bassedas did not, firing low to Carlo Cudicini's left. Ranieri, rarely slow to make a change, did so eight minutes later, his choice eased by the earlier sight of Graeme le Saux holding his thigh in discomfort. Gronkjaer took over the left wing-back role from the injury-plagued England man. Amid Chelsea's largely unconvincing early attacks, Zola's talent shone brightly. After 10 minutes he served warning by driving just wide after a delicious back-heel from Gustavo Poyet. Then the Italian and Uruguayan combined quickly and cleverly again, this time for Zola to loft a shot that was deflected for a fruitless corner. By now Zola was simmering and he came to the boil on 37 minutes when he received Babayaro's pass, cut inside and, despite facing four Newcastle shirts, half-turned and curled a superb shot from 22 yards past the hopelessly beaten Shay Given. Gronkjaer's surging runs down the left featured in Chelsea's early second-half attacks but it was the more thoughtful touches of Zola and Poyet that threatened to unhinge United who, despite a fair share of possession, rarely threatened Cudicini's goal. Chelsea pressure paid off on 62 minutes when Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink curled an inviting low cross into the area. Poyet reacted fractionally faster than the defenders, flicking the ball cleverly past Given. \u0095 Chelsea's chairman Ken Bates last night slated Monaco over the French transfer deadline-day collapse of Frank Leboeuf's proposed move home, for which a \u00a32.5m fee was agreed two weeks ago. \"To put it bluntly, Monaco can't come up with the money,\" said Bates. \"The situation is unresolved because their president has done a runner and is unavailable having interfered with and messed up the negotiations.\" \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "body": "<p>It was all clearly unfair. A schoolboy had been asked to write a short monologue and present it to his drama class. Sixteen days later he was in jail. He would be there for 34 days, for his 16th birthday, for Christmas, for new year. The writing community was immediately up in arms. His right to freedom of expression had been violated, and they wanted to do something about it. Last Sunday they congregated in Ottawa, at a fundraising event called Artists for Freedom of Speech. </p> <p>Michael Ondaatje, whose first novel Billy the Kid was about a young killer, spoke.\"It was full of violence, but somehow I learned to keep it there. I see myself as someone who was saved by writing.\" </p> <p>Margaret Atwood spoke. \"Childhood can be hell,\" she said, quoting The Untouched Key by Alice Miller. \"One reason childhood can be hell is that as a child you can have no power, you can have no recourse and nobody who will actually believe you if you did go so far as to express, in one way or another, something that happened to you.\" She gave the boy a book, First Words, a collection of early writing by well known authors. Even Stephen King weighed in, telling the Toronto Globe and Mail: \"I am in total solidarity with that young man and admire him because it shows again that the imagination is the most powerful force on earth.\" </p> <p>Ondaatje and Atwood aren't commenting now, though. And there's a feeling that they, and the other 13 writers who read at the event, might have been a little rash. That the case might be more complicated than they initially thought. That it has less to do with free expression than they'd like, and that not enough people went to the school to find out what was actually going on. They would have discovered, among other things, that disciplinary action was taken because of an alleged series of death threats, rather than as a direct result of his monologue. </p> <p>\"Was he arrested for reading his monologue in class? In my view, no,\" says Frank MacEachern, the crime reporter for the local newspaper, the Cornwall Standard-Freeholder. He attended the boy's bail hearing. \"If he hadn't allegedly made threats to three students in the school, I doubt the police would have been involved.\" </p> <p>The boy, who cannot be named under Canadian law because of his age, had only been at Tagwi secondary school in Avonmore, Ontario, for a couple of months when this flared up. It's a small, rural school of about 500 students. In interviews with Canadian papers, and a written account of the event that he released to papers, the boy says that he was bullied soon after he arrived. (The family was not answering calls last night.) </p> <p>\"People would make fun of me, my family, my possessions and my actions/words. One thing I remember quite clearly is one boy saying 'Can you say \"The rat ran over the river across the road?\" ' If you notice there are seven Rs in that one sentence. I have difficulty saying one R (this is my shameful secret which until now I would deny impetuously) which turn out sounding like a W or an O (due to an inability of my mouth).\" </p> <p>Some of the writers in Ottawa, for instance novelist Elizabeth Harvor, did focus on the serious issue of bullying in schools, citing the fact that the boy claimed to have been, on one occasion, so severely beaten up that he went home bloody. </p> <p>His classmates, however, have a slightly different story. They admit he was probably taunted, but Marty Partridge, a Grade 11 student who was in the drama class when the boy presented his monologue, says: \"To start he was just some other kid. But then he started to make himself more noticeable ... He would go around making things up, saying that some kids were ugly and dirty and stuff like that. He walked around by himself a lot of the time.\" </p> <p>November 22 was the last of four sessions in which students presented monologues they had written. Each session had been followed by a critique by students and class, and so far he had not done well. Once he had even plagiarised Stephen King, changing the names, but effectively passing off The Boogeyman from Night Shift as his own work. The youth has told the media that there were four assigned categories that he could choose from, fantasy, tragedy, comedy and horror. But Cory Lafave, another student in the drama class, says this is pure fabrication; students could write about anything they chose. </p> <p>The youth, who has a black goatee and whispy hair, and is about 5ft3in and slightly stubby, stood up in front of the class and delivered the monologue with what Partridge describes as a smirk. And the script that has since been released, Partridge adds, isn't exactly what the class heard. \"He ad-libbed a lot. Like he said that if anyone tried to get out they'd walk up to the front door and he'd shoot them between the eyes with a shotgun. </p> <p>\"The object of a monologue is to get people's attention and get them to hear what you want to say, at the edge of their seat wanting to hear the rest. And he did that. He had me. He totally wrote a good monologue. That was just a good piece of theatre.\" The drama teacher agreed, praising the effort, rather than censuring it. </p> <p>It seems that after this there were more alleged death threats. People started talking about the monologue, asking if there was a hit list, allegedly learning that there was, and that there were three specific people inplicated. His defence counsel, Frank Horn, says that everything is rumour, that hysteria snowballed and the allegations of threats are unfounded, that nothing can be pinned down. That his client is being persecuted by students jealous of someone \"who might make it\". \"My guy is innocent.\" Be that as it may, much of the school, with an eye to the \"12:12\" mentioned in the monologue, had decided not to attend on December 12. </p> <p>The police were called in. He was arrested on Friday December 8, and would not be released until January 9. While he was in jail, his 14-year-old brother had charges laid against him for allegedly making death threats at a different school, and his two older sisters, who ran away from home, alleged to the Ottawa Citizen that it was their brother who was often the bully. </p> <p>During that time, in the arts community and among civil rights activists, support for the boy was growing quickly. PEN (the Canadian branch of the writers' association) got involved. Clayton Ruby, one of the most famous criminal lawyers in Canada, asked to take over the case. The International Writers Festival organised Sunday's rally. </p> <p>But by the time the rally occurred, writers were backtracking. Broadcaster Laurier Lapierre, who has suffered bona fide censorship, even said: \"At the beginning of this great drama, it seemed so simple. Now it is no longer so clear.\" The boy, who attended in a Pink Panther tie, was meant to read his story to the 400-strong crowd, but didn't. </p> <p>More measured, thoughtful voices are now beginning to be heard too. There are issues here that go beyond saving face, beyond misjudgments. The first is, of course, the very real issue of freedom of speech. If the case comes to trial (for four alleged threats) in September, and it's discovered that the boy was disciplined because of real threats to the safety of the school, then PEN Canada and the writers who ranged themselves for him risk trivialising censorship. Secondly, the writing in the monologue is OK - but, as award-winning children's author Tim Wynne-Jones puts it, anyone who's worked with young people has seen writing like it before. </p> <p>Wynne-Jones was scheduled to speak in Ottawa, but dropped out because he was concerned about all these things, concerned that it wasn't really an issue of the freedom of speech.\"I was particularly concerned about the boy, that he would confuse notoriety with talent.\" The funds collected are to go towards getting him into a creative writing program. The rest will go to supporting programs that put artists in contract with students. </p> <p>\"I think he needs tutors; if he were to sit down and read the books of the people who stood up and spoke, he'd be a lot smarter than he was a month ago. I do feel sorry for what he's had to go through. I hope he's not left out in the cold now all this has blown over. I don't think any of the writers who were there on Sunday will be inviting him over for tea.\" </p> <p><strong><a name=\"A\">'Twisted': the story that landed its writer in jail</a></strong></p> <p>There's this boy who's been harassed and tortured all his life until he was at the brink of insanity and sanity. His entire life has been one test after another: testing his patience, his sanity, emotions and morals. </p> <p>Without rest there was always someone on his back, teachers, principals, but most of all the other students. I could go on talking about their hatred for him for no specific reason other than they wanted to. His teachers cheated him, tricked him and despised him, and why not they had their pets. </p> <p>Teachers always have their pets and their toys. No matter how much they preached about not having any. The toys were good for playing with then discarding, the pets you pampered looking mostly at their good points and getting attached. The principals well they didn't plain just like him. But it's the students I think that did it; yeah definitely, it was the students that warped him. </p> <p>No matter how hard he tried there was always something wrong with him in their minds. He tried and tried he really did. He wanted to be just like them at first, well up until Grade 7 that is. Then he came to terms with his life and realised that he didn't fit in. In Grade 9 he began to like being different, being an outcast, he liked the dumb comments, because by then they weren't at him but rather at someone on the outside. Somehow during all this he had slowly and steadily retreated from the world, putting up barriers and shields, so many in fact that he saw the patterns of the fabric of life, saw all the little holes and tears, gimmicks and faults. </p> <p>He discovered what life is: pain. When you live something else is in pain. When you eat something had to go through pain to be there for you to eat, even base feeling is little shocks being shot up the nerves. Every action, thought and creation is borne on pain. Any ways one day he went to class in a bad mood, he had been pushed really hard that day. This was supposedly his favourite class, but it had been the hardest on him, his projects were all considered pieces of crap, his classmates of course loved him as always. Apparently this class had been set-up that day. Oh what fun they had that day poking and prodding and pushing and pulling. And of course who said \"Boo,\" no one that's who. I supposed they had no clue what he was thinking about because I'm sure that if they did they would have backed off really, really quickly. </p> <p>The next day he came to school he was super happy, bouncing along in a hyper/jovial mood, he laughed at the stupid jokes pretending not knowing they were insults. He was buddy buddy with the teachers. Oh just the best of moods. I guess that no one knew that he had woken up at 5.00 in the morning and jimmied the lock on one of the back doors. In addition, that in his bag he was carrying 13 packages of C-4 and a detonater. I guess he had fun stashing them under the garbage bags in the pails, 4 packages under the tables in the cafeteria, mostly in high traffic areas. </p> <p>Apparently he kept one strapped to his chest just in case the others were found. Luckily for him none were found. Everyone blissfully unaware that their lives were in very imminent danger. He went happily along waiting for the right moment. He decided to detonate at 12:12 exactly. Everyone would be having lunch and having fun.</p>",

If the case comes to trial (for four alleged threats) in September, and it's discovered that the boy was disciplined because of real threats to the safety of the school, then PEN Canada and the writers who ranged themselves for him risk trivialising censorship. Secondly, the writing in the monologue is OK - but, as award-winning children's author Tim Wynne-Jones puts it, anyone who's worked with young people has seen writing like it before. Wynne-Jones was scheduled to speak in Ottawa, but dropped out because he was concerned about all these things, concerned that it wasn't really an issue of the freedom of speech.\"I was particularly concerned about the boy, that he would confuse notoriety with talent.\" The funds collected are to go towards getting him into a creative writing program. The rest will go to supporting programs that put artists in contract with students. \"I think he needs tutors; if he were to sit down and read the books of the people who stood up and spoke, he'd be a lot smarter than he was a month ago. I do feel sorry for what he's had to go through. I hope he's not left out in the cold now all this has blown over. I don't think any of the writers who were there on Sunday will be inviting him over for tea.\" 'Twisted': the story that landed its writer in jail There's this boy who's been harassed and tortured all his life until he was at the brink of insanity and sanity. His entire life has been one test after another: testing his patience, his sanity, emotions and morals. Without rest there was always someone on his back, teachers, principals, but most of all the other students. I could go on talking about their hatred for him for no specific reason other than they wanted to. His teachers cheated him, tricked him and despised him, and why not they had their pets. Teachers always have their pets and their toys. No matter how much they preached about not having any. The toys were good for playing with then discarding, the pets you pampered looking mostly at their good points and getting attached. The principals well they didn't plain just like him. But it's the students I think that did it; yeah definitely, it was the students that warped him. No matter how hard he tried there was always something wrong with him in their minds. He tried and tried he really did. He wanted to be just like them at first, well up until Grade 7 that is. Then he came to terms with his life and realised that he didn't fit in. In Grade 9 he began to like being different, being an outcast, he liked the dumb comments, because by then they weren't at him but rather at someone on the outside. Somehow during all this he had slowly and steadily retreated from the world, putting up barriers and shields, so many in fact that he saw the patterns of the fabric of life, saw all the little holes and tears, gimmicks and faults. He discovered what life is: pain. When you live something else is in pain. When you eat something had to go through pain to be there for you to eat, even base feeling is little shocks being shot up the nerves. Every action, thought and creation is borne on pain. Any ways one day he went to class in a bad mood, he had been pushed really hard that day. This was supposedly his favourite class, but it had been the hardest on him, his projects were all considered pieces of crap, his classmates of course loved him as always. Apparently this class had been set-up that day. Oh what fun they had that day poking and prodding and pushing and pulling. And of course who said \"Boo,\" no one that's who. I supposed they had no clue what he was thinking about because I'm sure that if they did they would have backed off really, really quickly. The next day he came to school he was super happy, bouncing along in a hyper/jovial mood, he laughed at the stupid jokes pretending not knowing they were insults. He was buddy buddy with the teachers. Oh just the best of moods. I guess that no one knew that he had woken up at 5.00 in the morning and jimmied the lock on one of the back doors. In addition, that in his bag he was carrying 13 packages of C-4 and a detonater. I guess he had fun stashing them under the garbage bags in the pails, 4 packages under the tables in the cafeteria, mostly in high traffic areas. Apparently he kept one strapped to his chest just in case the others were found. Luckily for him none were found. Everyone blissfully unaware that their lives were in very imminent danger. He went happily along waiting for the right moment. He decided to detonate at 12:12 exactly. Everyone would be having lunch and having fun.",

It must be the most entertaining procedure I've been through to get a waitressing job, but there was a fun crowd in the waiting room with me, all hoping to start together. Besides seeing another four or five people I was also given a full medical check, which seemed fantastically over the top.

That evening we had intended to return to watch the fireworks, but I realised I'd never been to a proper club in Sydney which, given the lively nature of the city, seemed a terrible omission.

Good luck, and I'll see you in Sydney! And I'll get to see how travelling with friends compares to travelling alone. I headed to Chinatown, central Sydney to watch the parade celebrating Chinese New Year (of the snake). It was a colourful event with dancing dragons and elaborately dressed Chinese ladies, but for some reason the audience didn't seem too enthused - maybe it was just Sunday morning lethargy. Meanwhile I treated myself to Chinese dinner to keep in with the spirit of the day.</p> <p>I met up with Brian and we made a snap decision to go to Fox studios. While we were there, a live MTV-style programme was being filmed for Australian TV so we sat to watch it being shot. It was then that an assistant came over and asked if we'd like to request a song - Brian asked for an obscure Australian band named Porkers, and the assistant then asked if we'd mind having a chat with the presenter before he played our choice!! We had about two minutes of interview, which went out live, and pretty much involved us discussing hostels and travelling. So, if anybody was watching Channel V at 5.30pm on Sunday, that girl in the pink top was me! </p> <p>Later that night a group of us headed to the Clovelley hotel to watch a live band, and Brian and I got recognised from our TV appearance - the guy even seemed quite excited to see us! So there you have it, fame at last! But when I returned to my room later that night, I found it had been infested with enormous cockroaches. Michaela had sprayed the room, leaving it full of dying roaches. I was just glad I hadn't been the one to discover them! Not wanting to sleep in my room, the two of us squeezed in with the couple next door. </p> <p>On Monday I felt the need to stretch my legs again, so decided to give the pleasant walk from Bondai to Coogee another try. I was quite surprised to find that doing it alone it took only half the time that it had with Josh, but then again I did stick to the path on this occasion! Stopping at the Coogee Bay Hotel, a man started asking about my interest in sailing as he was going to rent a boat. I like to think I've learnt something from my travels so I politely declined his invitation to join him and left - no more outings with random strangers! </p> <p>At 8.30am the next morning I went to the hotel for my first day's work, and it felt eerily like going back to school. A group of 10 of us, all on working visas, were given our uniforms then sat in a circle in a room where we were given name-cards and made to play getting-to-know-you activities! Our first day didn't involve any actual work but it did include a tour of the hotel, including a peek into one of the bedrooms. This $800-a-night room had incredible harbour views and a walk in bathroom - we all noted that it was a little nicer than our own present accommodation! The quality of service - room service tables, 24-hour laundry, overnight shoe-shine - just reminded me of a movie and I found it fascinating. The only drawback was that at the end of the day, having watched videos and filled out handbooks, we were all informed there was no work for the next week. All of us hoping to work there are in exactly the same boat, so this was pretty distressing. Quick tip for anybody hoping to work in Sydney - jobs are easy enough to come by, but February is a much better month to start looking, so I'm told. </p> <p>Wednesday saw torrential rain for the second day in a row which scuppered my plans. Still, I made it into Sydney to see if there was any other temporary work going only to hear repeatedly that things will be picking up in a couple of weeks. I hope so. I'm itching to continue my adventures again - in the mean-time if anyone has good suggestions for Sydney-based activities they'd be very much appreciated.

      "bodyText": "Corus, the Anglo-Dutch steel group, will today announce plans to axe more than 5,000 British jobs, despite government anger over the way the company has conducted itself. South Wales will bear the brunt of the two-year programme of cuts, through the mothballing of virtually the whole of the Llanwern plant and the closure of the Ebbw Vale tinplate business. Sir Brian Moffat, the Corus chairman and acting chief executive, has summoned union leaders to his HQ in London's West End for a breakfast briefing. But he will provoke a storm of protest at the scale of the cutbacks - which include the closure of a core mill on Teeside - despite an unprecedented lobbying campaign led by Tony Blair. Downing Street yesterday expressed anger over the company's refusal to tell even the government details of its plans or exactly when it would make the announcement. \"It's a pretty extraordinary state of affairs where, as the government, if you were to ask us when is this decision going to be announced we would say we don't know,\" the Downing Street spokesman, Alastair Campbell, said. He contrasted Corus' attitude with the constructive talks between Whitehall and other firms engaged in major restructuring such as Vauxhall at Luton and BMW/Rover during the crisis in Longbridge last year. Industry sources said last night that Sir Brian had been rattled by the sheer intensity of the lobbying campaign but felt he had no alternative but to slash over-capacity brought about by shrinkage of the Britain's manufacturing base and a flood of cheap imports. Corus's UK operations lost at least \u00a3350m last year. The prime minister and senior colleagues, fearing that the thousands of job losses will damage Labour, have pulled out all the stops to convince Corus that the recent weakening of the pound against the euro and a decision by several car groups to increase output will ease the group's medium-term trading prospects. But Sir Brian is expected to press ahead with plans to shut virtually the entire Llanwern plant, keeping just some specialist units. Llanwern, employed 3,300 last summer, but could now be reduced to just a 600-strong workforce. The main steel union, the ISTC, will later today put flesh on plans for a consortium to take over the plant, despite Corus's initial rejection of its demand for talks on a buyout.",

      "body": "<p>Britain's most senior judge last night clashed with the home secretary over Jack Straw's plan for longer prison sentences for the 100,000 most persistent offenders, which is to form a centrepiece of Labour's election manifesto. </p> <p>Mr Straw yesterday made plain he was prepared to see prison numbers rise to tackle the hardcore of persistent criminals who, he claimed, were responsible for nearly half of all crime. He said there might come a time when fewer prison places were needed \"but that is a long way off\". </p> <p>Within hours the lord chief justice, Lord Woolf, marking the 10th anniversary of the day he handed his influential report on prison reform to the then home secretary, described jail overcrowding as the \"Aids virus of the prison system\" and called on courts to pass shorter sentences. </p> <p>He said: \"The judiciary must play their part in reducing the use of custody to what is the acceptable and appropriate minimum. When a custodial sentence is necessary the shortest sentence should be imposed. </p> <p>\"Frequently one month will achieve everything that can be achieved by three months and three months will achieve everything that can be by six months and so on.\" </p> <p>Lord Woolf made clear last night in his Prison Reform Trust lecture that the best way of cutting crime was a higher detection rate rather than an increase in the prison population of 62,000, which is already forecast to rise to more than 78,000 by 2007. </p> <p>\"What has to be realised, and I include the government here, is that a short custodial sentence is a very poor alternative to a sentence to be served in the community. It is far more expensive. It will do nothing to tackle the offender's behavioural problems. It should be regarded as being no more than a necessary evil whose primary purpose is to obtain compliance with court orders.\" </p> <p>His views were in sharp contrast to those of Mr Straw, who declared that community penalties did nothing for 80% of the 100,000 hardcore of the most persistent offenders. </p> <p>\"Almost without exception, every persistent offender sentenced to custody has been through the mill of community sentences and has still reoffended,\" Mr Straw said in a lecture to the Social Market Foundation. </p> <p>\"If we are to get on top of this problem of persistent criminality and are to process more through the system prison numbers may well have to rise. We have factored that into our spending plans. In time, and it will take time, once the system has got on top of this problem, then there may be a need for fewer places, but that is a long way off.\" </p> <p>Mr Straw's decision to target the \"100,000 most persistent offenders\" is one of the first fruits of work by the former BBC director general, Lord Birt, as the home secretary's special adviser on crime. Initial findings of Home Office research commissioned by Lord Birt suggest that this hardcore accounts for about 10% of all active criminals and yet has a much greater impact on the crime rate than was previously thought. </p> <p>\"Half are under 21.

      "bodyText": "Britain's most senior judge last night clashed with the home secretary over Jack Straw's plan for longer prison sentences for the 100,000 most persistent offenders, which is to form a centrepiece of Labour's election manifesto. Mr Straw yesterday made plain he was prepared to see prison numbers rise to tackle the hardcore of persistent criminals who, he claimed, were responsible for nearly half of all crime. He said there might come a time when fewer prison places were needed \"but that is a long way off\". Within hours the lord chief justice, Lord Woolf, marking the 10th anniversary of the day he handed his influential report on prison reform to the then home secretary, described jail overcrowding as the \"Aids virus of the prison system\" and called on courts to pass shorter sentences. He said: \"The judiciary must play their part in reducing the use of custody to what is the acceptable and appropriate minimum. When a custodial sentence is necessary the shortest sentence should be imposed. \"Frequently one month will achieve everything that can be achieved by three months and three months will achieve everything that can be by six months and so on.\" Lord Woolf made clear last night in his Prison Reform Trust lecture that the best way of cutting crime was a higher detection rate rather than an increase in the prison population of 62,000, which is already forecast to rise to more than 78,000 by 2007. \"What has to be realised, and I include the government here, is that a short custodial sentence is a very poor alternative to a sentence to be served in the community. It is far more expensive. It will do nothing to tackle the offender's behavioural problems. It should be regarded as being no more than a necessary evil whose primary purpose is to obtain compliance with court orders.\" His views were in sharp contrast to those of Mr Straw, who declared that community penalties did nothing for 80% of the 100,000 hardcore of the most persistent offenders. \"Almost without exception, every persistent offender sentenced to custody has been through the mill of community sentences and has still reoffended,\" Mr Straw said in a lecture to the Social Market Foundation. \"If we are to get on top of this problem of persistent criminality and are to process more through the system prison numbers may well have to rise. We have factored that into our spending plans. In time, and it will take time, once the system has got on top of this problem, then there may be a need for fewer places, but that is a long way off.\" Mr Straw's decision to target the \"100,000 most persistent offenders\" is one of the first fruits of work by the former BBC director general, Lord Birt, as the home secretary's special adviser on crime. Initial findings of Home Office research commissioned by Lord Birt suggest that this hardcore accounts for about 10% of all active criminals and yet has a much greater impact on the crime rate than was previously thought. \"Half are under 21. Nearly two-thirds are hard drug users. More than a third were in care as children. Half have no qualifications at all. And three quarters have no work and little or no legal income,\" Mr Straw said. He added that although they were convicted again and again by the courts there was little appreciable increase in the length of sentence they received each time. Tony Blair told the cabinet this week that the \"war on crime\" would be a central part of Labour's election manifesto and at the heart of it would be a radical reform of sentencing to ensure that the persistent offenders received longer sentences each time they were convicted by the courts. Mr Straw said he wanted to end the \"just deserts\" philosophy contained in the 1991 Criminal Justice Act - the piece of legislation that had incorporated most of the reforms Lord Woolf recom mended in his report. The 1991 act had ensured that the courts did not hand out prison sentences out of all proportion to the crime, and contained a \"milk bottle clause\" which was quietly dropped. This ensured that a judge did not sentence a thief to six months in prison for stealing a bottle of milk even if it was the 12th time he had been convicted of the offence. Mr Straw said yesterday it was time to make the sentence fit the offender rather than the offence. He acknowledged that the clause in question had been dropped, but said the courts still sentenced within its spirit and few persistent offenders got longer sentences every time they appeared in court.",

      "bodyText": "The chief inspector of schools in England produced a report yesterday which he said offered no comfort to those, including William Hague, who wanted to abolish local education authorities. Mike Tomlinson's first big report, summing up the results of 91 LEA inspections, criticised the unacceptably wide variation in services and said most councils had little effect on school standards. But unlike his predecessor, Chris Woodhead, who questioned whether LEAs should exist at all, Mr Tomlinson defended the part they played in organising school admissions and transport. \"They do have important roles in strategic planning across an area which could never been taken by an individual school,\" Mr Tomlinson said. \"The report gives no comfort to those who believe that the existence of LEAs serves no purpose. It does not support the abolitionist argument. Nor does it support some of the more exaggerated claims made by LEAs.\" The chief inspector's comments amounted to criticism of the Tory \"free schools\" policy, which would, in effect, abolish LEAs. But Mr Tomlinson denied he was being party political. Estelle Morris, the school standards minister, hailed the success of the inspections, introduced by the government in 1997. Mr Tomlinson said 59 of the 91 authorities inspected were performing satisfactorily, of which 19 could be described as good. But 17 performed so badly they required intervention from government. Mr Tomlinson sympathised with LEAs for suffering a decade of \"something approaching turmoil\" as governments chopped and changed their role. Provision of special educational needs was the most worrying area. The LEAs inspected had responded well to its recommendations on tackling racism. Ofsted had searched for evidence of an \"LEA effect\" on school performance but found no strong link, although a well-run authority in a prosperous area could have an impact. Ms Morris said the worst authorities had been inspected first. She was unhappy but not surprised by the difference in standards of LEAs. The government has \"outsourced\" - privatised - some or all services in 18 poor-performing education authorities. Ms Morris said she would continue to encourage even \"authorities in a position of relative strength\" to outsource some services when required. The best performing authorities were, according to the Ofsted report: the corporation of London, Coventry, Kensington and Chelsea, Warwickshire, Lewisham, Birmingham, Oxfordshire, Hammersmith and Fulham, Hartlepool, Newham, Wandsworth, Barking and Dagenham, York, North Yorkshire, Solihull, Hertfordshire, Camden and Bury.",

As the legislative environment becomes more complex and as pressure grows for charities to become more professional, finding trustees with skills in finance, fundraising, employment and other areas has climbed the agenda for many organisations. There is also a growing recognition of the need to diversify trustee boards, many of which are still dominated by white, middle-aged and middle-class members. Outside the traditional word-of-mouth recruitment method, advertising for trustees is becoming more common. \"Advertising can be useful but may be expensive, not just because of paying for ads but also in the work required to prepare and send out information on the charity and process responses,\" says Janet Cummins, chief executive of consultants Charity and Fundraising Appointments.

Or maybe there's a work function on the horizon and all the local Caf\u00e9 Rouges are booked? Well, why not take advantage of the luxurious combination of concrete and turf on offer at Wembley stadium? Yes, it looks like the historic old lunk is going to be hanging around for some time yet, so you might as well make use of it.</p> <p>The demolition of Wembley has been put back by another six months, the FA announced today, with the spanking new stadium (if it hasn't become a big bingo hall by then) not expected to be completed before December 2004. The delay has been blamed on the recent change in design from the Ken Bates-inspired \"chuck a hotel on the end of it\" plans to the new streamlined \"chuck a set of rugby posts in it\" version. But whatever the reason, the ground will not be ready for the 2004 FA Cup final, as had been expected. As Adam Crozier put it today: \"The start date has been moved back, so the end date has had to move back as well.\"</p> <p>The new Ken Bates, Sir Rodney Walker, believes, like his predecessor, that plans for the new Wembley will prove popular enough with investors to raise the funding needed. Sir Rodders recently presented the new plans to the boards of the FA and Wembley National Stadium Limited (ie: the people who approved the old plans) and is ready to go to the city in April. \"I am enormously encouraged by the reaction of the FA board. Everybody wants the project to succeed,\" said Sir Rodders, stating the obvious. \"I am confident that with the new support package we have outlined today [the details of which have not been disclosed], the likelihood of City backing has been greatly enhanced.\" Well, let's flipping well hope so.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>TOTALLY HAPPY</strong></p> <p>It was supposed to be the winter sale to end all sales. All old stock - yes, all of it - had to go! But today, the storerooms of swanky west London boutique Chelsea's of Chelsea have a surprisingly familiar feel. Look, there's cheeky chap Dennis Wise cheeky-chapping away! And there's Ed de Goey moping around, because his move to Anderlecht fell through because of his wage demands. And after his \u00a32.5m move to Monaco collapsed last night, even Frank Leboeuf is still in the shop window (although they have buffed his forehead something lovely).</p> <p>There are many ways you could describe Leboeuf's strained relationship with Chelsea's in recent months. However, a \"love affair\" probably isn't one of them - unless your romantic evenings are regularly interrupted by the social services, that is. \"It's been a very nice love affair and I'm very pleased I'm still a Chelsea player,\" Leboeuf said. And just to prove how happy and unbitter he is he then accused Monaco president Jean-Louis Campora of showing \"total disrespect\" to himself and Chelsea by pulling out of the deal at the last minute.</p> <p>\"Having seen the politics, I'm glad to be staying at Stamford Bridge,\" Frank insisted as the shadow of a large pig crossed his shiny pate. \"I have nothing to be embarrassed about, but as a Frenchman, I feel ashamed of Monaco's behaviour, particularly the president. He has been so unprofessional.\" After bashing us over the head with his fake sincerity, Leboeuf then went for the jugular, lauding Claudio Ranieri as \"great\" and even claiming: \"There is no problem at all with me staying. I might yet finish my career here.\" Is there no end to the man's cheek?</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"I think Lazio are better, and I'm not just saying that just because I'm here now.

Nally plans to take his dangerously syrupy show - which boasts schmaltz like Up From The Ashes and Keep The Flags Flying Red - to Asia, Japan and Korea, as well as eastern Europe. \"I have even had a call this morning from Poland which blew me away!\" cooed the over-excited producer.</p> <p>The whole farce will begin on April 9, when British tenor Russell Watson - \"opportunity\", \"great honour\", \"incredible\", \"simper\" - plays Busby in a charity performance in Manchester. The fun-loving Imperial Lord Ferg will share the stage: for one show only, he's playing himself. But while Ferg's presence will undoubtedly light up the whole arena, it's a shame that none of the current United stars are to appear in the production.

Vivendi said it was no hurry to sell its 22.7% holding but the resignation of Mr Licoys will make it easier to pursue negotiations. The US cable company Liberty Media Group is expected to take the \u00a34.4bn stake. It already owns 20% of BSkyB's parent company News Corporation. French newspapers are reporting a cash deal is imminent. Vivendi chairman Jean-Marie Messier is keen to find a buyer who will be able to work with News Corp owner Rupert Murdoch. Vivendi is expected to spend its \u00a34.4bn windfall on a share buyback, which will boost its flagging share price. Analysts have pointed to the vulnerability of Vivendi's stock ever since the company merged with Seagram of Canada in a blockbusting \u00a350bn deal last year. A quick sale of the BSkyB stake will also boost Mr Murdoch's plans to float his Sky Global Networks satellite TV company. BSkyB will form a core part of the company and a flotation will be hampered if there are doubts about the company's shareholder structure.

The survey found 76% of workers drinking three or more cups of coffee, tea or cola every day - enough caffeine to act, in the words of researcher Dr David Lewis, \"as a powerful diuretic [causing] people to visit the toilet more frequently, which can lead to power-zapping dehydration.\" </p> <p>You'd be entitled to feel confused: few substances in recent years have been subject to so many entirely contradictory clinical studies as caffeine - not even wine and beer, the other once frowned-upon stimulants now periodically presented as elixirs of good health. </p> <p>Depending on whom you believe, coffee-drinking either raises blood pressure, increases the chances of miscarriage and the risk of developing Alzheimer's, arthritis and infertility - or is a powerful protection against the worst effects of bronchial asthma, colon cancer, bladder cancer, hayfever, Parkinson's, heart disease, depression, anxiety, gallstones, dermatitis, chronic angina and hypotension. </p> <p>A web of sponsors on both sides of the debate means that few studies are entirely free of commercial interests: this week's study, in one of the more clunkingly obvious examples, was funded by Volvic, manufacturers of an ideal water-based alternative to latte-slurping. </p> <p>Besides dehydration, coffee blocks the receptors of adenosine, a chemical in the brain that normally counters the effects of adrenaline - which explains why it does enhance the sense of alertness. But related effects of this process, some researchers believe, can be calamitous: \"The daily blood pressure elevations caused by caffeine consumption,\" says Dr James Lane of Duke University in North Carolina, \"could contribute to an increased risk of coronary heart disease in the general population that consumes caffeine.\" </p> <p>A group of Swedish researchers reported in December that women who drank more than four cups of coffee per day in early pregnancy doubled the chances of spontaneous abortion, while caffeine intake is also thought to affect birthweight - though the precise mechanisms by which it contributes to any of these problems remain mysterious. </p> <p>An unresolved argument rages, too, over its addictiveness: even a single cup of instant coffee daily is sufficient to induce withdrawal symptoms when it is taken away; on the other hand, studies into the parts of the brain which are most affected by cocaine, nicotine and morphine addictions have repeatedly failed to reveal any such effect from coffee drinking. </p> <p>But the issue reaches far beyond coffee. Caffeine makes a regular appearance in the ingredients lists of numerous common painkillers. But since most researchers deny that it has any painkilling function, and argue that one of the key symptoms of caffeine withdrawal is headaches, it doesn't take a particularly paranoid conspiracy theorist to suggest that something vaguely suspicious might be going on. And non-coffee-drinkers are not, of course, immune: there is around 50mg in a cup of tea, and up to 20mg in a cup of hot chocolate. </p> <p>And yet for every study demonstrating a health risk, there is another suggesting benefits. Take coffee and cancer: a year ago, a study published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Public Health found that smokers reduced by half the extra risk they run of contracting bladder cancer if they drink coffee as well. </p> <p>\"For centuries people have been investigating exactly the same thing. Around 2.5bn cups are drunk per day in the world, so if this was an issue, it would be a problem of epidemic proportions,\" says Dr Euan Paul, scientific adviser to the industry-backed coffee science information centre. \"Recent papers are in complete contradiction to the Volvic findings.\" </p> <p>The debate is complicated by the fact that coffee remains, relatively speaking, a drink of the wealthy (and, in the case of the high-end joints, the profligate).

A&amp;E consultants are the hardest people in the world. </p> <p>So we filled out the forms and he told me the risks and he took some blood for storage and finally I was allowed to get my hands on some ridiculously potent anti-retroviral drugs: three brown tubs of huge yellow horse-medicine tablets. And then I had to wait 36 hours for my senior house officer to nobly but gently convince our acutely delirious (and actually rather sweet) patient that we needed a confidential HIV test on him. The rules on things like consent are made by Guardian-reading do-gooders with cultural studies degrees on committees where everyone wears black polo-neck sweaters, and for a day and a half I was seriously considering switching teams and becoming a reactionary old bigot. </p> <p>So let me tell you about the drug side-effects. I thought it was bad enough when I took too much aspirin for an earache and it made my haemorrhoids bleed. These HIV drugs are monstrous: my heart heavy with the knowledge that I was over-reacting outrageously, and that the drugs were almost certainly unnecessary, I struggled zombie-like to the toilet every half hour to release another payload of loose, green stool, post on-call with 23 new patients on four hours' sleep, feeling like I was indulging in some morbid kind of disease tourism to the land of HIV positivity.

      "body": "<p>There is public horror at the stories of children's heads in jars, of shelves of babies' body parts. And all over the country, doctors stare at their newspapers and TV screens, bemused and unable to comprehend what all the fuss is about. The hospitals talk about \"outdated bad practice in one or two pockets\", which is intended to convey the impression that it used to happen and perhaps still does in some isolated areas, but of course, it isn't the norm. </p> <p>The truth is that snipping out bits and pieces at postmortems has always been standard practice, one that is so entrenched that no one sees anything wrong with it. The reason relatives have never been told is that what they don't know won't hurt them. </p> <p>This excuse is part of what the medical profession likes to see as its paternal role - thought for others. Those of us who have seen the profession at close quarters have always known that this is a lie, a cover-up for sheer arrogance andinsensitivity. Doctors remain unable to tell the difference between empathy and sympathy yet still try to convince us that they are kindly, golden-hearted, caring Dr Camerons. </p> <p>I was once a cardiac technician; all you needed to come within my remit was a pulse or the absence of one. I worked in heart surgery, heart disease, resuscitation, and research in various hospitals here and abroad, rising to chief tech before I changed careers. So I know that patients belong to the medical profession from the moment doctors lay stethoscopes on them. We're not talking about the removal and retention of organs from a few babies and children, or a few hundred even; we are talking about patients of all ages and sizes. That is what that desperate smokescreen is intended to cover, that the situation is across the board, adults as well as children. </p> <p>Organs are retained for a variety of reasons. For instance, there is great rivalry between medics and surgeons, and if something goes wrong in a case they share, one lot will try to blame the other. I often collected someone's heart from pathology and took it back to my medic colleagues for examination, in the hope that a badly sutured plastic valve could be identified, or maybe a leaking vein or artery, so that the pointed finger could be diverted back to the surgeons. No one ever thought to ask the relatives; medicine just doesn't work like that, and anyway, what they don't know won't hurt them. </p> <p>And medical research needs supplies of organs, and there are papers to be written to enhance and further medical careers.

I often wondered if their mothers were aware that their children were here on our dusty shelves and I had an almost irresistible urge to cover them up to stop idle eyes gazing at them.

      "bodyText": "There is public horror at the stories of children's heads in jars, of shelves of babies' body parts. And all over the country, doctors stare at their newspapers and TV screens, bemused and unable to comprehend what all the fuss is about. The hospitals talk about \"outdated bad practice in one or two pockets\", which is intended to convey the impression that it used to happen and perhaps still does in some isolated areas, but of course, it isn't the norm. The truth is that snipping out bits and pieces at postmortems has always been standard practice, one that is so entrenched that no one sees anything wrong with it. The reason relatives have never been told is that what they don't know won't hurt them. This excuse is part of what the medical profession likes to see as its paternal role - thought for others. Those of us who have seen the profession at close quarters have always known that this is a lie, a cover-up for sheer arrogance andinsensitivity. Doctors remain unable to tell the difference between empathy and sympathy yet still try to convince us that they are kindly, golden-hearted, caring Dr Camerons. I was once a cardiac technician; all you needed to come within my remit was a pulse or the absence of one. I worked in heart surgery, heart disease, resuscitation, and research in various hospitals here and abroad, rising to chief tech before I changed careers. So I know that patients belong to the medical profession from the moment doctors lay stethoscopes on them. We're not talking about the removal and retention of organs from a few babies and children, or a few hundred even; we are talking about patients of all ages and sizes. That is what that desperate smokescreen is intended to cover, that the situation is across the board, adults as well as children. Organs are retained for a variety of reasons. For instance, there is great rivalry between medics and surgeons, and if something goes wrong in a case they share, one lot will try to blame the other. I often collected someone's heart from pathology and took it back to my medic colleagues for examination, in the hope that a badly sutured plastic valve could be identified, or maybe a leaking vein or artery, so that the pointed finger could be diverted back to the surgeons. No one ever thought to ask the relatives; medicine just doesn't work like that, and anyway, what they don't know won't hurt them. And medical research needs supplies of organs, and there are papers to be written to enhance and further medical careers. There is always someone looking for some little piece and another someone perfectly willing to supply it - and who will ever know? Sometimes pathology technicians have been known to make extra money selling items to drug companies who do their own research, and however hotly denied this may be, it is true all the same. After all, the patient no longer needs it, so where's the harm? I have yet to meet anyone who was asked to donate a piece of a loved one, let alone their unborn or stillborn child.

As these leviathans towered into mostly industrial skies, smaller jails closed. In 1877, the number of prisons fell from 113 to 56; after 1918, 29 more were closed. Until 1952, only two new prisons were built; those that emerged with the consumer boom of the 50s and the consequent rise in crime were, with the exception of Everthorpe, North Humberside (1958), wings added to existing buildings or conversions of country houses and various institutions. </p> <p>By the late 50s, Britain's prisons were an architectural ragbag.

Industrial relations problems in the 70s and 80s brought a lapse in staff morale and greater separation between jailers and jailed, and though a new liberalism began to take hold in the 80s, public building programmes were so slow that new prisons were 10 years out of date by the time they opened. </p> <p>Most prisons dating from the 60s tend to be little more than regimented rows of corridors lined with cells.

In 1993, Michael Howard, Margaret Thatcher's rightwing home secretary, promoted a policy of increasing the prison population.

The politicians' need to win cheap votes by appealing to our basest instincts means prison design has lagged behind that of architecture generally.

Major General Sir Joshua Webb, military engineer and the first surveyor general of prisons, designed Pentonville, inspired by the Eastern Penitentiary, Philadelphia.

Incidents of violence, in particular sexual assault, are notably low and prisoners and staff meet more often than in radial prisons like Pentonville or postwar corridor or \"hotel\" designs. </p> <p>Yet no matter how humane, Woodhill was not to be the way forward. Too decent for macho politicians, according to Leslie Fairweather, architect and co-editor of Prison Architecture, Policy, Design and Experience, (Architectural Press). \"What we need,\" he says, \"is a sane, rational and humane policy towards prisons, carried through by successive governments. We won't get that as long as criminal policy is used as a crude vote-catcher. Current hardline policy means we may need 20 new prisons in the next few years and who knows how the balance between the private and public sector will work out. It's a complex situation we're facing and not a very nice one.\"</p>",

Too decent for macho politicians, according to Leslie Fairweather, architect and co-editor of Prison Architecture, Policy, Design and Experience, (Architectural Press). \"What we need,\" he says, \"is a sane, rational and humane policy towards prisons, carried through by successive governments. We won't get that as long as criminal policy is used as a crude vote-catcher. Current hardline policy means we may need 20 new prisons in the next few years and who knows how the balance between the private and public sector will work out. It's a complex situation we're facing and not a very nice one.\"",

First, something about the constituency (for which he now has a co-author in Byron Criddle). Then, a section mainly drawn from newspaper judgments, though often prefaced by a snappy summary of Roth's own. \"Fast-maturing ambitious lawyer\", says his entry for Vaz, \"rising fast in the government after a slow start as one of a dozen frontbenchers denied ministerial posts in 1997, retarded by controversial reports of involvement in local Leicester politics.\"</p> <p>Then, in each case, what is often a long and mercilessly comprehensive section called History, running in eminent cases to many pages.

Roth seems to work on the basis that it's better to give too much than too little, and you can't be sure that some minor occasion won't take on a greater significance later.</p> <p>So they're all here: the achievements, promotions, escapades, the articles for the Guardian expressing opinions of which their authors may one day repent. Here are maidens and ministerial speeches, but also Jimmy Wray's divorce, and Tim Yeo's love children, and Charles Wardle's links with Mohamed Al Fayed, and the views which got Bob Wareing into trouble over Serbia.</p> <p>There are also offbeat facts which even close observers of parliament may not have known. The veteran Labour leftie Brian Sedgemore had a policeman brother whose duties included protecting the Princess Royal. Labour backbencher David Winnick did not speak until he was four (he's made up for that since). Tory grandee Sir Peter Tapsell was conceived in the Raffles hotel, Singapore. And the 1997 Labour entrant Derek Wyatt, a former rugby international, has published a book called Wisecracks from the Movies.</p> <p>So what light does the entry on Vaz shed on his present predicament? There's a sense that people had seen trouble coming. Before he gained ministerial office, says Roth, he was getting a reputation for \"fickle flexibility\", as \"a preening weather vane mainly interested in his admirers\", for deft footwork touching every useful base, \"not necessarily with consistency or for long\". \"The most incredible networker I have ever met,\" Lord Irvine is quoted as saying, whether in praise or blame is not clear. He also has a weakness for chocolate. But mixed with all that are tributes to his dedicated work for the Asian community and even his self-deprecation. Accused by the Tory MP for Market Harborough of being a \"pompous barrister\", Vaz agreed, adding that he'd rather be spending his life \"wandering around Market Harborough, bitterly trying to be recognised\".</p> <p>These four books add up to a rich and varied and sometimes even poignant pageant of parliamentary life. Here are all those eager young 70s lefties - Milburn, Byers, Denham, Stringer - now transformed into equally eager Blairites. Here are the coming men and women who in the end never made it. Here too are all those bright-eyed 1997 arrivals who somehow blend into each other, so that you need Roth beside you to sort out your Michael Fosters and Gareth Thomases (there are two of each) and disentangle your Debra Shipleys from your Rachel Squires.</p> <p>And if sometimes a judgment or two sounds familiar, that is because the 2,500 pages of Roth's quadrology are so often ruthlessly pillaged by reporters with a profile to write and with too little space, it seems, to acknowledge their source. An election in May will bring in a host of new MPs who will need to be profiled too. Work has already started.</p> <p>\u0095 Parliamentary Profiles, 1997-2002, by Andrew Roth and Byron Criddle, Parliamentary Profile Services, 020 7222 5884 (\u00a3150 for set of four).</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:david.mckie@theguardian.com\">david.mckie@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Here are maidens and ministerial speeches, but also Jimmy Wray's divorce, and Tim Yeo's love children, and Charles Wardle's links with Mohamed Al Fayed, and the views which got Bob Wareing into trouble over Serbia. There are also offbeat facts which even close observers of parliament may not have known. The veteran Labour leftie Brian Sedgemore had a policeman brother whose duties included protecting the Princess Royal. Labour backbencher David Winnick did not speak until he was four (he's made up for that since). Tory grandee Sir Peter Tapsell was conceived in the Raffles hotel, Singapore. And the 1997 Labour entrant Derek Wyatt, a former rugby international, has published a book called Wisecracks from the Movies. So what light does the entry on Vaz shed on his present predicament? There's a sense that people had seen trouble coming. Before he gained ministerial office, says Roth, he was getting a reputation for \"fickle flexibility\", as \"a preening weather vane mainly interested in his admirers\", for deft footwork touching every useful base, \"not necessarily with consistency or for long\". \"The most incredible networker I have ever met,\" Lord Irvine is quoted as saying, whether in praise or blame is not clear. He also has a weakness for chocolate. But mixed with all that are tributes to his dedicated work for the Asian community and even his self-deprecation. Accused by the Tory MP for Market Harborough of being a \"pompous barrister\", Vaz agreed, adding that he'd rather be spending his life \"wandering around Market Harborough, bitterly trying to be recognised\". These four books add up to a rich and varied and sometimes even poignant pageant of parliamentary life. Here are all those eager young 70s lefties - Milburn, Byers, Denham, Stringer - now transformed into equally eager Blairites. Here are the coming men and women who in the end never made it. Here too are all those bright-eyed 1997 arrivals who somehow blend into each other, so that you need Roth beside you to sort out your Michael Fosters and Gareth Thomases (there are two of each) and disentangle your Debra Shipleys from your Rachel Squires. And if sometimes a judgment or two sounds familiar, that is because the 2,500 pages of Roth's quadrology are so often ruthlessly pillaged by reporters with a profile to write and with too little space, it seems, to acknowledge their source. An election in May will bring in a host of new MPs who will need to be profiled too. Work has already started. \u0095 Parliamentary Profiles, 1997-2002, by Andrew Roth and Byron Criddle, Parliamentary Profile Services, 020 7222 5884 (\u00a3150 for set of four). david.mckie@theguardian.com",

      "bodyText": "Kelvin MacKenzie's TalkSport has finally shed the female listeners it didn't want. According to new listener figures, up to 75% of the station's fan base is now male - a proportion it claims is \"unique in commercial radio\". TalkSport was founded as shock-jock station Talk Radio. It was transformed a year ago from a round-the-clock news and phone-in network to a sports station. Before the original schedule was ripped up and replaced with a diet of cricket and football, the station had what it called a \"mish-mash\" of listeners. \"Our typical listener was a woman in her 40s in the lower end of the demographic scale,\" said a spokesman. \"Now our biggest listenership is young men aged 25 to 34.\" Over the past two years, Mr MacKenzie has crusaded against the BBC's Radio 5 Live in a bid to become the nation's number one sports station. However, its listenership still hovers around the 2m mark - 2.16m listeners in the three months to December 17 - a fraction of Radio 5's 5.52m audience. The gap between BBC Radio and the commercial sector widened further in the closing months of 2000, according to Rajar figures. The combined share for the BBC's national and local radio networks was up slightly - 51.7% in the final quarter of last year. That compares favourably with 51.4% in the previous quarter and 51.3% in the same period for 1999. Commercial radio's share of listening between October and December 2000 was 46%. This was down by 0.7 of a percentage point on the preceding quarter and the same three months of 1999. But the commercial sector crept ahead of BBC Radio in terms of weekly reach in the final quarter of last year. Commercial radio reached 30.871m listeners each week, just 49,000 more than BBC Radio. In the previous quarter, the BBC had inched ahead by a mere 20,000 listeners. But the headline figures hide some contrasting fortunes for the BBC's stations. BBC local radio was the biggest winner, increasing its collective share of listening from 11.1% to 12% quarter on quarter. And Radio 1 was the biggest loser, dropping 1 percentage point to 10%. In the final quarter of 1999 the BBC pop station had 10.9%. Radio 2 continued to grow its listener share, claiming 13.6% of the UK market. In the previous quarter Radio 2 notched up 13%. \"The figures are testimony to the enduring power of radio in an increasingly competitive and fragmented media marketplace,\" said BBC director of radio Jenny Abramsky. \"It's good news across the board and I'm thrilled that Radio 2 and BBC local and national services have done so well.\" In the commercial radio sector, the combined share of listening for the four national stations - Atlantic 252, Classic FM, TalkSport and Virgin Radio - stayed the same at 8%. But Classic FM was up from 4.2% to 4.7%, quarter on quarter; while Virgin Radio was down by 0.3 percentage points to 1.4%. Local commercial radio saw its share drop by 38.7% in the summer months to 37.9% in the final quarter of 2000. That was also half a percentage point down on the same period in 1999.",

      "bodyText": "Ten years after the Soviet collapse, the small Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia have been commemorating over the past few weeks the bloody events of early 1991 that were the midwives of their rebirth as independent nations. They have been bittersweet events marked by sadness at the deaths of a score of people when Moscow's crack troops bloodily sought to stifle the recovery of sovereignty and liberty in the Baltic; and by satisfaction at their escape from the Kremlin's grip, their growing ties with Germany and the Scandinavian democracies, and their ultimate prospects of being integrated into the European Union. In Riga, the capital of Latvia, crowds of people turned out on a frosty evening to build bonfires and remember the five people, including one little boy, who died when Soviet troops attacked the Latvian interior ministry in January 1991. A week earlier, in neighbouring Lithuania, 14 people were killed in a bloody crackdown ordered by Moscow against the independence-seekers. Such were the dying gasps of the Soviet regime, and six months later the Baltic republics regained the independence crushed by Stalin in 1940 when he annexed the region as part of his diabolical deal with Hitler to carve up eastern Europe between them. If the break-up of the Soviet Union was surprisingly unbloody generally, the bitterness lingers in the Baltic at these needless deaths and on the anniversary the calls have been ringing out for Moscow to apologise for the killings, most loudly in Estonia where no one was killed. ''We see that the crimes of the past are not regretted, but in fact glorified [in Russia],'' the Estonian foreign minister, Toomas Ilves, complained. ''The past is not a supermarket where you can pick and choose what to praise and what to deny.'' But in President Vladimir Putin's Moscow, immersed in a wave of Soviet nostalgia, stubbornly proprietorial about its lost imperial possessions, and aggrieved that it is no longer the superpower that held the satellite states captive, sorry is the hardest word. There is a contemporary vogue among western statesmen for the S-word. Bill Clinton can say sorry to Africa for the slave trade. Tony Blair can voice his regret to the Irish about Britain's behaviour in the 19th century famine. The Vatican of Pope John Paul II can issue wordy apologies for Roman Catholicism's persecutions of other religions in centuries past. Germany, of course, has long been issuing mea culpas to the victims of the Third Reich, most spectacularly with Willy Brandt prostrating himself in Warsaw, though these days Gerhard Schr\u00f6der's Berlin Republic wants to put the breast-beating behind it and be a ''normal'' country. Even France may in the end be brought to the point where it apologises for the atrocities it perpetrated in Algeria. But Moscow never utters the s-word. A few weeks ago, Sweden and Russia ended nine years of research into the fate of Raoul Wallenberg, the Swedish diplomat who saved thousands of Hungarian Jews from the Nazi gas chambers before disappearing into Stalin's Gulag. For the first time officially, the Swedish government apologised to the Wallenberg family for the negligence it showed in the 40s and 50s on Wallenberg's fate. But Russia, while insisting that Stalin's secret police executed Wallenberg at its Lubyanka headquarters, still could not say sorry to the relatives for the murder. Opposite the Lubyanka in central Moscow there is a small piece of granite from Solovetsky Island in the far north, one of the first prison camps in the Gulag. The boulder is a modest and eloquent gesture in memory of the countless millions who perished in the Gulag. But the stone was not laid by the Russian state or government which have erected no national monument to the millions of innocent victims of the Soviet regime. A bunch of human rights activists who campaign against national amnesia were responsible - though, of course, they could not have laid the stone without official blessing. Continuity is a leitmotif of Putin's Russia, whereas Boris Yeltsin was more about caesuras, breaking with the past. Whether talking about the national anthem or the KGB's successors or the material legacy, the Kremlin stresses that Russia is the inheritor of the Soviet Union. The positive aspects are stressed, the nasty bits ignored. The inheritance and the memory are partial.

      "body": "<p>The Libyan government is today considering compensation payments to the families of victims of the Lockerbie bombing, as a group representing the British families of those who died in the tragedy gathered in London to press for an independent public inquiry.</p> <p>The Libyan ambassador to London, Mohammed al-Zwai, said today that his government will consider both compensation payments and agreements reached with the UN security council if Abdel Baset al-Megrahi's appeal against his conviction for the bombing fails. The security council agreements include the requirement that Libya offer compensation and accept responsibility for the bombing. </p> <p>Megrahi, a Libyan citizen, was sentenced yesterday to life imprisonment for the murder of 270 people in the 1988 bomb attack on Pan Am flight 103. Scottish judges accepted that he was a special agent for the Libyan government, thereby implicating Tripoli in the attack. According to Libyan television reports, Megrahi will lodge an appeal against his conviction within 14 days.</p> <p> Mr Zwai's comments seem to contradict statements out of Tripoli that the Libyan government bears no responsibility for the bombing. Libyan foreign minister Abdel Rahman Shalgam has insisted that Tripoli will never accept responsibility for the attack. </p> <p> Colonel Muammar Gadafy's government has not been indicted in the bombing, but the Lockerbie blast was alleged to have been committed to \"further the purposes\" of Libyan intelligence. The prosecution has charged that the attack was carried out to avenge the US bombing of Tripoli and Benghazi in 1986.</p> <p> Following the verdict, Libya called for an end to the UN sanctions imposed after the Lockerbie bombing. </p> <p> \"The sanctions imposed on Libya must be lifted completely because the Lockerbie case was used as a pretext to delay their lifting,\" foreign ministry spokesman Hassouna Chiouch told a news conference. \"Now that the court has ended the case, the sanctions must be lifted completely.\" </p> <p> \"We extend our hand to the United States to build relations based on mutual respect and benefit for the two parties,\" Chiouch said. \"Now that the Lockerbie case is behind, we look forward with interest to improving our relations with the United States in the interests of both countries and of peace worldwide.\"</p> <p> Foreign secretary Robin Cook said Britain and the United States both agreed Libya \"must\" fulfil the UN security council resolutions before the sanctions will be lifted. Mr Cook stressed that Libya is barred from offering \"no fault\" compensation.</p> <p> \"Libya has in the past said it would pay compensation if there was a guilty verdict. There has been a guilty verdict, and a guilty verdict against a very senior official of Libyan intelligence,\" said Mr Cook.</p> <p> \"Libya can't walk away from their responsibility for the act of their official,\" he added.</p> <p> In Washington, President George Bush praised the conviction and said the Libyan government must take responsibility for the attack. After less than two weeks in office, the Bush administration faces a major foreign policy decision on how hard to squeeze Libya. </p> <p> State department spokesman Richard Boucher laid down four demands with which the United States said Libya must comply. </p> <p> \"That means revealing everything they know about the Lockerbie bombing, paying reparations, a clear declaration acknowledging responsibility for the actions of the Libyan officials and clear unambiguous actions which demonstrate the Libyan government understands its responsibilities,\" Mr Boucher said. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the British families of those who died in the Lockerbie bombing are gathering in London today to press for further inquiries into the disaster. The group, which includes high profile campaigners Dr Jim Swire and the Rev John Mosey, will call for an independent public inquiry into unanswered questions surrounding the circumstances of the bombing. </p> <p>The families have always maintained they want a public inquiry into issues not fully explored in the Fatal Accident Inquiry which was completed in 1991 or in the criminal trial which ended yesterday. </p> <p>Most crucially, they want the failure of the intelligence services and the aviation authorities to stop the bomb getting on board to come under the spotlight. </p> <p>Several bomb warnings were circulating at the time of the disaster including the so-called 'Toshiba warning' which advised that a bomb hidden inside a radio cassette recorder could be smuggled on to a plane. The bomb which blew up the Pan Am flight was hidden inside a Toshiba radio cassette recorder.</p> <p>Previous calls for a public inquiry have been rejected on the grounds that such a move would prejudice the long-awaited criminal trial. Now that the trial is finally over, the families will argue that there are no grounds for rejecting a public inquiry. </p> <p>Scotland's top law officer said today that insufficient evidence exists at this time for more prosecutions over the Lockerbie bombing. Colin Boyd QC, the Lord Advocate, added that it is clear that the man convicted yesterday for the outrage was not acting alone.</p> <p>Following the announcement of the verdict yesterday, Al-Amin Khalifah Fhimah, Megrahi's co-accused who was acquitted, left the court at Camp Zeist, a former US military base in the Netherlands, a free man. </p> <p> Taken to a safe house last night, he was expected to leave the Netherlands for home today. The time and place of his departure are closely guarded secrets. Megrahi remained in the specially built prison where he and Fhimah had been held since Tripoli handed them over in April 1999. </p> <p> An official source said Megrahi's mother had been taken to a Tripoli hospital after collapsing, overwhelmed by news that her son had been jailed for life. </p> <p> An appeal would be heard at Camp Zeist, except in the highly unlikely event Megrahi chose not to be present - in which case it would be held in the Scottish capital, Edinburgh. </p> <p> And under the terms of the groundbreaking deal under which the Libyans were brought for trial, Megrahi stays at the camp until the entire legal process is complete. </p> <p> Any appeal would take months to get under way, legal experts say. There is no automatic right of appeal in Scottish law, and that alone complicates and delays the process significantly. </p> <p> <b>The verdict</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk/guardian/pdf/0131lockerbieverdict.pdf\" target=\"_new\">Full text of the judges' verdict (pdf file)</a><br> You will need Adobe Acrobat to view this file.

The show was one of the highlights of the BBC's weekday drama with up to 7m viewers when it was last screened last summer. And it was hailed as one of the few dramas the BBC developed that could compete with ITV for the hearts and minds of viewers. \"Five years is a good innings, but it is a question of if we can do more with the characters and the situation,\" said a BBC spokesman. \"Playing the Field has done a terrific job but you never know how long a series is going to run.\" The final series of Playing the Field will air in the autumn. It will consist of 3 x 120-minute episodes instead of the usual 6 x 60-minute formats. Tiger Aspect Productions has sold Playing the Field to Whoopi Goldberg's US production company, One Ho Productions.",

Mr Vajpayee, who has called a meeting of the federal cabinet today to discuss measures to rehabilitate the devastated state, said enough relief material had reached Gujarat. </p> <p>\"We are getting relief material from other states, from abroad, there is no dearth,\" he said. </p> <p>But survivors in Bhuj, the largest town nearest to the epicentre of the quake, said they had spent a sixth night in the open in falling temperatures. One former state lawmaker said people were desperately looking for shelter and tents were in short supply. </p> <p>\"The tragedy is not that there is no one to help, it is the opposite,\" the Times of India said in an editorial. \"Relief is coming in a tidal wave, rescue missions have arrived from across the globe but there is no direction to these efforts.\"</p> <p>Prime Minister Vajpayee said law and order in Gujarat was under control amidst persistent local media reports that armed gangs had threatened survivors with knives and were stealing jewellery. </p> <p>One newspaper said nomads had landed in the quake zone from the neighbouring state of Rajasthan to take foodstuff meant for the survivors. </p> <p>Most Indian political groups, including the main opposition Congress party which is bitterly opposed to the ruling coalition, have held back on criticism, saying this is not the time to play politics. </p> <p>But at least one former federal minister said the Gujarat government had completely failed to deal with the calamity and must be sent packing. \"The state government has failed to protect the rights of the people for speedy relief,\" Subramaniam Swamy said.</p> <p>The earthquake has brought key commercial activities in the region to a halt.

It has 10 jetties of which six are used for offloading crude while four are used for loading and unloading dry cargo. Two of the dry cargo jetties are badly damaged, mainly because of cracks in the concrete support piles, Mitra said. </p> <p>\"The cracks in the jetties is a major concern for us,\" he said. \"The complete rectification will take at least six to eight months on the dry cargo jetties.\" </p> <p>India's diamond trade has also been badly hit as 80% of the country's lucrative polishing and cutting business takes place in Gujarat.</p> <p>Traders in Ahmedabad, Gujarat's main city which has about 5,000 cutting and polishing factories, said today that even though their buildings were undamaged by the quake, most units were shut because panic stricken workers had fled the city. </p> <p>Only about 10-15% of the diamond units are working and the diamond trade in Ahmedabad is losing some 20m rupees (about \u00a3300,000) a day because of the shutdown, traders added. </p> <p>\"I expect that it will take another week to 10 days before things normalise,\" said Ramesh Naidu, a member of the Ahmedabad Diamond Association. </p> <p><strong>How you can help</strong> <br><a href=\"http://www.redcrossdonations.org.uk\">Red Cross appeal</a> or call 08705 125125 <br><a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/atwork/emerg/indiaearthquake.htm\">Oxfam</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/pressrels/270101.html\">Save the Children</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.unicefusa.org/alert/emergency/indiaeq/\">Unicef</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.interaction.org/india00/index.html\">US organisations involved in the relief effort</a> </p> <p> <strong>Related articles</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/naturaldisasters/story/0,7369,431731,00.html\">01.02.2001: The quake, the mourning and the long wait</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/naturaldisasters/story/0,7369,431207,00.html\">31.01.2001: Tales of hope in Indian town that turned to dust</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/naturaldisasters/story/0,7369,430742,00.html\">30.01.2001: After the devastation, the miracle of a baby saved from a concrete tomb</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/naturaldisasters/story/0,7369,430744,00.html\">30.01.2001: Tragedy of UK doctor who died</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/naturaldisasters/story/0,7369,430307,00.html\">29.01.2001: Hopes fade as toll rises to 20,000</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/naturaldisasters/story/0,7369,430302,00.html\">29.01.2001: 'In half a minute everyone was killed'</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/naturaldisasters/story/0,7369,430308,00.html\">29.01.200, comment: Lessons from past disasters go unheeded</a> </p> <p> <strong>Photo gallery</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/gall/0,8542,429420,00.html\">The disaster in pictures</a> </p> <p> <strong>Interactives guides and graphics</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/naturaldisasters/flash/0,7365,430599,00.html\">Interactive guide to the Indian earthquake</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/graphic/0,5812,428815,00.html\">Map of the disaster zone</a> </p> <p> <strong>Audio</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0129harding.ra\">29.01.2001: Indian quake leaves devastation 'on an epic scale'</a><br>The relief effort has come too late for the victims of Friday's devastating earthquake, reports <strong> Luke Harding </strong> in Ahmedabad.

But, despite major progress, many junior doctors continue to work unacceptably long hours with inadequate rest periods. </p> <p><strong>How long are junior doctors expected to work now?</strong><br>The new contract for junior doctors sets out a maximum 56-hour week, although the ultimate aim is to reduce this to 48 hours, in line with the phasing in of the European working time directive.

Those who are compliant, but who work between 48 hours and 56 hours will receive a 50% \"band 2\" supplement. These supplements will rise in December 2001 and again in December 2002, so that a junior doctor who is still working more than 56 hours in two years' time will receive a supplement worth 100% of the basic salary.</p> <p><strong>The increases sound enormous?</strong><br>Remember, these supplements are replacing the previous overtime or out-of-hours payments. But there is no doubt junior doctors will be better off. According to the Department of Health, a new junior doctor will typically be \u00a31,700 better off under the new system, earning nearly \u00a326,000, while a senior house officer will see an extra \u00a32,800, earning between \u00a332,305 and \u00a343,140.</p> <p><strong>How many doctors are currently working more than 56 hours?</strong><br>Departmental figures from September suggest nearly 25% of the 30,000 junior doctors in England are working over the stipulated maximum. Taking into account the requirements for rest periods, some 38% of junior doctors were thought to be \"non-compliant\". But managers claim the new questionnaires filled in by junior doctors, on which the new pay system is based, have led to massive increases in the numbers of non-compliant doctors. Some trusts have seen non-compliance levels rise from 20% to more than 80%. The British Medical Association puts this down to \"under-reporting\" of work levels under the old system.</p> <p><strong>What is the cost to the NHS?</strong><br>Hospitals are reporting a 10% increase in their junior doctors' paybill, with the big teaching hospitals being the worst hit. A survey of hospitals in the Northern and Yorkshire region found, on average, that acute trusts face increased costs of \u00a3771,031 - or \u00a35,281 per junior doctor. For community and mental health trusts, which employ far fewer junior doctors, the average increased cost is \u00a346,186 - or \u00a33,299 per junior.</p> <p><strong>What would it take to comply with the 56-hour working week ceiling?</strong><br>Hospital managers are currently examining this. The survey suggests that, on average, an acute trust would need an extra 17 junior doctors to reach compliance, although teaching hospitals will have to recruit far higher numbers. Also, given that juniors have to be supervised by consultants, an average of four additional consultants would be needed in each trust. In total, reaching compliance in the Northern and Yorkshire region would cost an estimated \u00a317m in new salary costs.

Any junior doctor whose working pattern is \"not compliant\" with the new deal - ie those working more than 56 hours or with insufficient rest periods - will now be paid a \"band 3\" supplement worth 62% of their salary.

Firstly, the cut comes on the back of a similar one earlier this month. This sends a clear signal around the globe that Alan Greenspan, head of the Federal Reserve and the most powerful financial chief in the world, believes interest rates should be lower.

When it falters, other economies, too, stop growing.</p> <p><b>But why do interest rates affect the economy?</b><br> Because when interest rates are high, companies and people have to pay more to borrow money.

This doesn't always happen.</p> <p><b>So will it work this time?</b><br> Probably. The US economy is showing signs of faltering, but it is a long way from a real recession. This recent rate cut may be enough to level things out. On top of that the European economy is still growing, as is Britain's. </p> <p><b>What effect will the US rate cut have on Britain?</b><br> It makes it more likely that our interest rates will fall - already British rates have reached their likely high point.

And if you're talking league titles alone, Blackburn still cut the mustard in this field: their stumble over the Premiership finishing line in 1995 came 81 years after their previous championship in 1914. MOST PLAYED What is the most-played fixture in top-flight football in England? asks Simon Conway. The most-played fixture in top-flight English football involves two of the Football League's founding members, Everton and Aston Villa. The Goodison giants have only spent four seasons out of the top division since the league was founded in 1888, while Villa have slummed it in the lower leagues for a meagre total of 12 years. Neither side plumbed the depths at the same time. Therefore, with 98 and 90 top-flight campaigns behind them by the end of last season, this fixture - played 173 times so far - is the one you're after. FROM GOOD TO BAD What is the fastest decline of a football club? Has any club ever gone from top-flight to basement in consecutive seasons? asks John Lee In the Eighties, Bristol City and Wolves both managed to travel from the First to the Fourth Division in consecutive seasons (via the picturesque route of the official receiver's office). City had enjoyed top-flight footer for four seasons between 1976 and 1980, but upon finally succumbing to relegation went into a sorry tailspin that saw them reach the very bottom of the pile (ie: 92nd place) within two years. The decline of Wolves was slightly less abject: they didn't actually hit the bottom as they plummeted from the First to the Fourth between seasons 1983-4 and 1985-6.

      "body": "<p>Brian's working day is predictable. His 13-hour shift at a young offenders institution starts badly, then gets worse. \"The first flashpoint is breakfast. It's the most volatile time of the day,\" he says. \"You've seen feeding time at the zoo, haven't you? Every morning at 8am, we unlock 60 lunatics who have been banged up for the previous 15 hours in a 9x4ft room.</p> <p>\"These lads are the sort that if something's not right with the breakfast, they make a noise about it. And with these lads, if things aren't right they don't just make a row about it, they tend to throw it at you. Things can become very confrontational, very quickly.\"</p> <p>After \"rolling around with one or two of them\", order is restored and the inmates return to their cells to eat. Around a dozen of the 60 young men on Brian's unit will then go to work or a class; the rest will stay in their cells for another four hours until lunch, and the prospect of more trouble.</p> <p>\"They have a million ways of winding each other up,\" says Brian, 42, and in his 11th year in the service. \"Take what we call 'the window warriors'. They're banged up so much and get so bored that they babble out of the windows to anyone who'll listen. Sooner or later they offend someone with a bit of racism or a comment about someone's mother. Thing is, they don't know how big the bloke they've offended is. It's a bit like road rage - they don't know what they've let themselves in for. When we open them up, they find out, and it goes off again. That's when we have to get in between them.\"</p> <p>Brian is one of the 21,000 men and 4,000 women who earn their living treading the landings of the nation's jails, taking home as little as \u00a315,000 a year for \"getting in between\" some of the most violent people in Britain. Their job is formidable: to care for the most disturbed and dangerous people in society kept against their will in often squalid conditions and varying degrees of privation. They work under the constant threat of violence, a threat which regularly becomes reality. No job, bar the police or the armed forces (when on active service), carries more stress. Divorce rates are high and alcohol is part of the culture.</p> <p>Among officers, as well as prisoners, physical and psychological abuse is routine and high rates of sickness are endemic, running at a national average of nine days a year per officer. Salaries are comparatively low, particularly in the south-east where the entry-level salary can be exceeded by a security guard working similar hours at a fraction of the risk.</p> <p>Hated by inmates, at best ignored and at worst reviled by the public, and with a flawed but astonishingly tenacious union, the Prison Officers Association (which is in an almost permanent state of conflict with management), the rump of officers feel assailed from all sides. Nowhere in Britain's creaking public sector, save perhaps for behind the doors they are paid to lock and unlock, is there a body of men and women that feel as unappreciated, reviled and wretched. Even police officers say that in comparison, they feel appreciated.</p> <p>Some, if not all, of the ordure heaped on prison officers is deserved. The decent men and women in the service are regularly betrayed from within by their colleagues; 99 officers nationwide are currently suspended from work on suspicion of range of offences, including absence, fraud, racist abuse and assaulting prisoners and fellow staff. Inmates allege routine abuse of powers by officers, and privately a police officer suggests prison officers are central to the distribution of drugs among prisoners.</p> <p>Criminal charges are outstanding against officers from Wormwood Scrubs and police are investigating allegations of assault against four officers from Portland young offenders institution (YOI). The home office has concede that the service is \"institutionally racist\" and last week director-general Martin Narey pointed to pockets of \"malicious racism\" at Feltham YOI, among other institutions.</p> <p>\"Morale has never been lower,\" the POA parrots at regular intervals, but it could be about to plumb new depths. The Campaign for Racial Equality has just begun a formal investigation, at the invitation of the home office, into accusations of racism in three establishments - Feltham, Brixton and Parc. Yet against this background of unrest and mistrust, violence and upheaval, prison officers continue to turn up to turn the locks.</p> <p>\"When you tell someone you're a prison officer, they look at you like you're an alien, like you've got three legs or something,\" says Brian, nursing his second pint in a quiet corner of the ex-serviceman's club he belongs to by virtue of his time in the Royal Navy.</p> <p>\"I suppose I'm a classic case. I left the navy and was looking for a decent wage to support myself and my family. I applied for the police and the prison service, and I got the prison job.\"</p> <p>Speaking to Brian and his colleagues, it becomes clear that an uncomplicated worldview is a prerequisite of the job. Realism about the inmates and cynicism about the potential for improvement offered by the system is universal. The service is overwhelmingly male and white - 2.5% of staff are from ethnic minorities, compared to 22% of inmates - and there is little room for romantics with dreams of rehabilitation.</p> <p>\"You have to consider the mentality of the lads we lock up. A small percentage of them are the ones who made a mistake and will get back to the straight and narrow once they've done their time. The majority are thieves, robbers, rapists and thugs who've done GBH, murder and dealt drugs. Most of them have mental problems. They are bad people,\" says Brian.</p> <p>\"Most of them also are going to spend half their lives in jail. They have no interest in doing the jobs we train them for - cleaning floors or laying bricks. Why should they? They can earn more money in a week bent than in a month straight. We should be training inmates for useful unemployment, not employment. Who's going to give someone a job once they know he's done time? What they need to be taught is that life isn't all about money, that it is OK to make what you can honestly, and live off that. That's what we have to do.\"</p> <p>\"Most of these lads have no anger control, none at all,\" says Nick, 10 years in the service and a father of four. \"We are the first person in authority they've ever come across who's going to stick around to say 'no'. Mum and dad never said 'no', or if they did he ignored them and did it anyway. The nasty policeman, he said 'no' but he's not around any more, and nor is the judge. But I'm here to stay, I'm the one who's going to teach this lad that you cannot always get what you want through violence.\"</p> <p>Saying no is the hardest and most important part of a job in which, according to Nick, \"softness\" is the greatest sin. \"It's all very well clipping the small guy round the ear, but if you do, you have to clip the 6ft6in bloke round the ear, too, and not everyone is prepared to do that.\"</p> <p>\"They do need discipline,\" Brian chips in. \"These people do not want to be in jail, but they do want to know where they stand. We all do. You need a mixture of Barraclough and Mackay, but the beauty of a Mackay is you know where you stand with him. Discipline protects the weak and gives boundaries to the strong.\"</p> <p>Prison officers are not renowned for their compassion, but those the Guardian speaks to all talk of their concern for those who cannot stay afloat in the brutal currents of jail. They are not impervious to the plight of the weak, nor hardened to it. \"A suicide is the worst thing that can happen,\" says one. \"The guilt is overpowering. It just feels like you've failed.\"</p> <p>Success as a prison officer is hard to gauge. It is measured by what doesn't happen - fights that don't start, suicide attempts averted, escapes thwarted, future offences not committed - but the key to it is \"jailcraft\". Jailcraft allows officers to: smell trouble before it starts; to spot the vulnerable before he tries to hang himself; and to work out when to search a cell, and when not to. It is a mastery of the rules of the game played between captive and captor. It is about survival and experience, and depends on officers having the time to know the inmates, something they complain they are increasingly denied.</p> <p>Efficiencies and pressure to make savings across the service have led to less officers doing the same amount work, and the hated cross-deployment, where officers carry out different tasks each day rather than sticking with the same inmates. On these issues and many others there is conflict with management, and the gap between them appears almost as irreconcilable now as it did in the early 90s when Derek Lewis, then the director-general, set out to break the power of the POA by successfully challenging their right to take strike action.</p> <p>The union, described then by Lewis as \"belligerent, threatening ... the last bastion of 1960s trade unionism\", claims 90% of staff are members and is a constant thorn in the side of reformers. Nothing moves in a prison without the co-operation of officers, leading opponents to claim the POA wants jails run for the benefit of officers. The POA counters that no one is better placed to advise on the workings of prison than the officers who work in them.</p> <p>For the service, the attempts at change involve an elaborate dance with the most reluctant of partners. But patience with the union is thin. \"There should be conflict - if there wasn't, I would want to know why - but in the final analysis, if the POA don't like it, they can lump it,\" says a senior management source.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, the officers share many of the views of the union. Brian and Nick agree that staff shortages and efficiencies make their job harder and the inmates' lives more miserable. \"If we have to cancel association or education or work because of a lack of staff, they get bored, and boredom leads to violence,\" says Nick.</p> <p>\"If we're always in a different place so we don't get to know the inmates, we can't spot the ones who are down and about to try and top themselves. They talk about education and throw money at it but forget about us, the people who administer the discipline, are supposed to be the role models, and know how it works on the landing. Management don't listen to us.\"</p> <p>\"You do feel a sense of loyalty to your employer, but it's frustrating when they don't let you do things the way you know is best,\" says Brian quietly. \"You deal with these lads and you want the best for them, even if sometimes that means banging them up 23 hours a day.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Some names have been changed.</p>",

Hated by inmates, at best ignored and at worst reviled by the public, and with a flawed but astonishingly tenacious union, the Prison Officers Association (which is in an almost permanent state of conflict with management), the rump of officers feel assailed from all sides. Nowhere in Britain's creaking public sector, save perhaps for behind the doors they are paid to lock and unlock, is there a body of men and women that feel as unappreciated, reviled and wretched. Even police officers say that in comparison, they feel appreciated. Some, if not all, of the ordure heaped on prison officers is deserved. The decent men and women in the service are regularly betrayed from within by their colleagues; 99 officers nationwide are currently suspended from work on suspicion of range of offences, including absence, fraud, racist abuse and assaulting prisoners and fellow staff. Inmates allege routine abuse of powers by officers, and privately a police officer suggests prison officers are central to the distribution of drugs among prisoners. Criminal charges are outstanding against officers from Wormwood Scrubs and police are investigating allegations of assault against four officers from Portland young offenders institution (YOI). The home office has concede that the service is \"institutionally racist\" and last week director-general Martin Narey pointed to pockets of \"malicious racism\" at Feltham YOI, among other institutions. \"Morale has never been lower,\" the POA parrots at regular intervals, but it could be about to plumb new depths. The Campaign for Racial Equality has just begun a formal investigation, at the invitation of the home office, into accusations of racism in three establishments - Feltham, Brixton and Parc. Yet against this background of unrest and mistrust, violence and upheaval, prison officers continue to turn up to turn the locks. \"When you tell someone you're a prison officer, they look at you like you're an alien, like you've got three legs or something,\" says Brian, nursing his second pint in a quiet corner of the ex-serviceman's club he belongs to by virtue of his time in the Royal Navy. \"I suppose I'm a classic case. I left the navy and was looking for a decent wage to support myself and my family. I applied for the police and the prison service, and I got the prison job.\" Speaking to Brian and his colleagues, it becomes clear that an uncomplicated worldview is a prerequisite of the job. Realism about the inmates and cynicism about the potential for improvement offered by the system is universal. The service is overwhelmingly male and white - 2.5% of staff are from ethnic minorities, compared to 22% of inmates - and there is little room for romantics with dreams of rehabilitation. \"You have to consider the mentality of the lads we lock up. A small percentage of them are the ones who made a mistake and will get back to the straight and narrow once they've done their time. The majority are thieves, robbers, rapists and thugs who've done GBH, murder and dealt drugs. Most of them have mental problems. They are bad people,\" says Brian. \"Most of them also are going to spend half their lives in jail. They have no interest in doing the jobs we train them for - cleaning floors or laying bricks. Why should they? They can earn more money in a week bent than in a month straight. We should be training inmates for useful unemployment, not employment. Who's going to give someone a job once they know he's done time? What they need to be taught is that life isn't all about money, that it is OK to make what you can honestly, and live off that. That's what we have to do.\" \"Most of these lads have no anger control, none at all,\" says Nick, 10 years in the service and a father of four. \"We are the first person in authority they've ever come across who's going to stick around to say 'no'. Mum and dad never said 'no', or if they did he ignored them and did it anyway. The nasty policeman, he said 'no' but he's not around any more, and nor is the judge. But I'm here to stay, I'm the one who's going to teach this lad that you cannot always get what you want through violence.\" Saying no is the hardest and most important part of a job in which, according to Nick, \"softness\" is the greatest sin. \"It's all very well clipping the small guy round the ear, but if you do, you have to clip the 6ft6in bloke round the ear, too, and not everyone is prepared to do that.\" \"They do need discipline,\" Brian chips in. \"These people do not want to be in jail, but they do want to know where they stand. We all do. You need a mixture of Barraclough and Mackay, but the beauty of a Mackay is you know where you stand with him. Discipline protects the weak and gives boundaries to the strong.\" Prison officers are not renowned for their compassion, but those the Guardian speaks to all talk of their concern for those who cannot stay afloat in the brutal currents of jail. They are not impervious to the plight of the weak, nor hardened to it. \"A suicide is the worst thing that can happen,\" says one. \"The guilt is overpowering. It just feels like you've failed.\" Success as a prison officer is hard to gauge. It is measured by what doesn't happen - fights that don't start, suicide attempts averted, escapes thwarted, future offences not committed - but the key to it is \"jailcraft\". Jailcraft allows officers to: smell trouble before it starts; to spot the vulnerable before he tries to hang himself; and to work out when to search a cell, and when not to. It is a mastery of the rules of the game played between captive and captor. It is about survival and experience, and depends on officers having the time to know the inmates, something they complain they are increasingly denied. Efficiencies and pressure to make savings across the service have led to less officers doing the same amount work, and the hated cross-deployment, where officers carry out different tasks each day rather than sticking with the same inmates. On these issues and many others there is conflict with management, and the gap between them appears almost as irreconcilable now as it did in the early 90s when Derek Lewis, then the director-general, set out to break the power of the POA by successfully challenging their right to take strike action. The union, described then by Lewis as \"belligerent, threatening ... the last bastion of 1960s trade unionism\", claims 90% of staff are members and is a constant thorn in the side of reformers. Nothing moves in a prison without the co-operation of officers, leading opponents to claim the POA wants jails run for the benefit of officers. The POA counters that no one is better placed to advise on the workings of prison than the officers who work in them. For the service, the attempts at change involve an elaborate dance with the most reluctant of partners. But patience with the union is thin. \"There should be conflict - if there wasn't, I would want to know why - but in the final analysis, if the POA don't like it, they can lump it,\" says a senior management source. Unsurprisingly, the officers share many of the views of the union. Brian and Nick agree that staff shortages and efficiencies make their job harder and the inmates' lives more miserable. \"If we have to cancel association or education or work because of a lack of staff, they get bored, and boredom leads to violence,\" says Nick. \"If we're always in a different place so we don't get to know the inmates, we can't spot the ones who are down and about to try and top themselves. They talk about education and throw money at it but forget about us, the people who administer the discipline, are supposed to be the role models, and know how it works on the landing. Management don't listen to us.\" \"You do feel a sense of loyalty to your employer, but it's frustrating when they don't let you do things the way you know is best,\" says Brian quietly. \"You deal with these lads and you want the best for them, even if sometimes that means banging them up 23 hours a day.\" \u0095 Some names have been changed.",

More than a decade later, in Footsteps: Adventures of a Romantic Biographer (1985), he recalled how obsessive his engagement gradually became, not just with Shelley, but with that whole group of English expatriates associated with him, as it moved from Geneva through Italy - Bagni di Lucca, Este, Venice, Rome, Naples, Ravenna, Pisa - shedding some members and adding others, before finally disintegrating when Shelley and Edward Williams were drowned off Leghorn in July 1822. Shortly thereafter, Byron and Trelawny embarked for Greece, Mary Shelley's troubled and troubling step-sister Claire Clairmont departed to become a governess in Russia, and in 1823 Mary and her last surviving child returned to the England she had not seen since 1818. \"The pursuit,\" Holmes confessed, </p> <p>\"became so intense, so demanding of my own emotions that it continuously threatened to get out of hand. When I travelled alone I craved after intimacy with my subject, knowing all the time that I must maintain an objective and judicial stance. I came often to feel excluded, left behind, shut out from the magic circle of his family. I wanted to get in among them, to partake in their daily life, to understand what Shelley called 'the deep truth' of their situation . . . Indeed I came to suspect that there is something frequently comic about the trailing figure of the biographer: a sort of tramp permanently knocking at the kitchen window and secretly hoping he might be invited in for supper.\"</p> <p>Holmes ends with a generalisation about 'the trailing figure of the biographer', but it is significant that it should be the Shelley m\u091dnage - in a book that also explores his biographical 'intimacy' with Robert Louis Stevenson, G\u091drard de Nerval and Mary Shelley's remarkable mother Mary Wollstonecraft - that occasions the reflection. There is something about 'the Shelley circle', and particularly its bizarre life abroad, that produces this effect. At its most extreme, it can lead to such a reductio ad absurdum as I am Mary Shelley, a book published in 1977, whose author Barbara Lynne Devlin claims to be her reincarnation and, with the help of an obliging medium, revisits Mary's past, informing the inquisitive readers that (yes) she did - though only once - go to bed with Byron and it was predictably wonderful (\"holding me in his fine, strong arms\" etc), whereas sex with Shelley's long-time friend Thomas Jefferson Hogg was quite revolting (\"He slobbered!\")</p> <p>Rather more soberly, Holmes in 1992 seems to have exorcised his own Shelleyan ghosts by writing a radio play about the last weeks at Casa Magni, that beach-house dangerously close to the sea at San Terenzo that Shelley loved and Mary (who by now was emotionally estranged from her husband, and suffered a near-fatal miscarriage there) detested. (To the Tempest Given appeared last year, in Holmes's collection Sidetracks: Explorations of a Romantic Biographer.) The material, based on letters and other biographical evidence, is enough to haunt anybody: the weird and isolated building, with too many people crammed together in it; Shelley's desperate but successful attempt to staunch Mary's haemorrhage by plunging her up to the waist in ice: his flirtation with Jane Williams (with whom Mary herself was later to fall in love); his nightmares of strangling Mary and of the sea overwhelming the house; various hallucinations including the one about meeting his own double, who asked him disconcertingly, \"How long do you mean to be content?\"; then the anguished days while the women waited for news of the little boat in which Shelley, Edward Williams and their cabin-boy had set sail from Leghorn, followed by the ghastly cremations on the beach.</p> <p>Miranda Seymour, in the preface to her new biography, Mary Shelley, confesses to having perpetrated, some twenty-five years ago, a novel (Count Manfred) about Byron. That is by no means unusual. Novels in which Byron appears more or less thinly disguised began during his own lifetime with Lady Caroline Lamb's Glenarvon of 1816. (\"I read Glenarvon too, by Caro Lamb,\" Byron remarked sourly after it was sent to him on the Continent. \"God damn.\") Mary Shelley herself would contribute several to the list. And they continue to be written. Shelley has received less fictional attention than Byron, although the American poet Elinor Wylie (1885-1928) did produce an embarrassing prose fantasy, The Orphan Angel, in which Shelley is rescued from the sea by a passing American schooner, and spends the rest of his life on that side of the Atlantic, without ever managing to communicate his whereabouts to anyone at home. Peter Ackroyd's Milton in America (1996) seems curiously, if perhaps unconsciously, parasitic on this earlier extravaganza. Milton, however, despite some fleeting fictional attention from Robert Graves, has never been able to vie with the Romantics in this respect. That perhaps has something to do with the degree to which many of the latter fictionalised themselves in their own work, thus offering an open invitation to later writers to extend the process. It also reflects the strikingly 'novelistic' character of many of their lives.</p> <p>John Barrell has observed acutely (in the LRB of 2 November 2000) that so-called literary biography seems now to have become markedly less 'literary', subordinating or virtually ignoring the work of the writer concerned, except insofar as it can be made to mirror the ups and downs, pleasures, pains and supposed secrets of his or her personal existence. This observation seems regrettably true and, although the balance is to some extent redressed by such excellent studies in the accurately entitled Literary Lives series (published by Palgrave) as Michael O'Neill's Percy Bysshe Shelley (1989) or Caroline Franklin's Byron (2000), not-very-literary biographies, some running to four hundred and more pages, continue to accumulate in the bookshops. There (presumably) they attract readers far more interested in the Romantics as personalities than in the works which, after all, are or should be the principal reason anyone at such a distance in time should want to revisit the lives of their authors. Inevitably, perhaps, these biographers often dress up speculations of their own as fact: that the young Wordsworth operated as a government spy, for instance, that Byron was a ruthless paedophile, or that Claire Clairmont in 1816 confessed that she had conceived a child by Shelley which he helped her to abort.</p> <p>For a variety of reasons, the life of Mary Shelley offers rich opportunities for fantasies of this kind, and it is very much to Miranda Seymour's credit that for the most part she declines them, or at least makes it clear that the hypotheses she does entertain are mere hypotheses. Her biography is level-headed, thorough, scholarly and consistently sympathetic to its subject without lapsing into hagiography. It is also lively and well-written. The notorious conundrums are all faced. Did Claire Clairmont at any of a number of possible points have an affair with Shelley? Who were the parents of Shelley's mysterious Neapolitan 'charge' Elena Adelaide, the short-lived infant he falsely registered as Mary's and his in February 1819? Exactly what caused his boat to go down in 1822: merely the squall, or was it rammed? Alternatively, did Shelley refuse to lower the sails in response to a sudden suicidal impulse? Did Mary's passionate relationship with Jane Williams after the two women returned to England become physically sexual? Seymour wisely refrains, given the continuing lack of evidence, from imposing answers.</p> <p>A few vaguenesses, or factual errors, mar the book. Closer attention, for example, to Marion Kingston Stocking's superb edition of The Clairmont Correspondence (1995) would have allowed Seymour to pinpoint more precisely than she does both Mary's first meeting with Byron, and the actual date (Saturday, 20 April 1816) Claire Clairmont finally manoeuvred him into bed. Seymour's statement that Thomas Moore \"had never bothered to read the memoirs which Byron gave him when he visited Venice in the autumn of 1819\", and so was entirely dependent in 1827, after they had been destroyed, on Mary Shelley's own account when writing his biography of Byron, is untrue. Unlikely in itself, it is contradicted by a letter of Moore's to Lord Holland in November 1821, in which he specifies the material he believes would need to be censored when the memoirs were eventually published. Her reference to Trelawny's dissolution of his \"brief marriage to a maid of Greece\", because she tried to abandon native dress for French fashions, rather glosses over the peculiarities - not to say, enormity - of the union itself. One wonders how much Mary Wollstonecraft's daughter ever learned about Trelawny's unfortunate child bride. And the 'Pisan affray' of 1822, of which Mary was a terrified witness - that very ugly skirmish with the dragoon Masi, probably instigated by the authorities in the hope of dislodging the Gamba family and their radical English associates from that part of Italy - could have done with more and sharper attention.</p> <p>In some ways, the second half of Seymour's biography, dealing with Mary Shelley's life between her husband's death in 1822 and her own in 1851, is the fresher and more arresting. This is a comparatively untrodden area. Understandably, the later years have always attracted far less attention than those during which the 16-year-old Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin eloped spectacularly with Shelley from Godwin's London house to the continent, came back to confront debt and estrangement from her father, then - established once more in Switzerland with Shelley - began Frankenstein during the famous ghost-story session with Byron, confronted the suicides of her own half-sister Fanny Imlay and of Shelley's wife Harriet after another return to England, and subsequently (now as Mary Shelley) took up that peripatetic existence in Italy which was to claim the lives of two of their three small children, and ended only when Shelley was drowned. It has sometimes been hard to remember that Mary Shelley's life continued for almost thirty years after that final catastrophe, extending well into the Victorian age. Her widowhood has never haunted biographers or moved them to long for admission to its various supper tables. Yet, as Seymour's book ably demonstrates, this period is in its way quite as extraordinary as the better known earlier one, and equally riddling.</p> <p>Seymour is excellent on the vexed subject of Mary's increasing conservatism: her eventual attempts to conceal something about which she had once been unabashed - that she lived with Shelley before they were actually married - her retreat from the atheism and the radical politics she had once shared with him, and her suppression or alteration, when editing his poetry and prose, of certain passages she came to regard as politically or sexually too outspoken. This was not simply a matter either of youthful unorthodoxy repudiated in age, or of response to the changing social climate in England. Compounded with those factors, at least for a time, was real fear lest she lose possession of her surviving child, Percy Florence, and of the meagre allowance granted the two of them by Shelley's appalling father. (Sir Timothy refused to the end of his days ever to meet her, and did his best to prevent publication of his son's work.) Seymour's respect and affection for Mary Shelley, attractively evident throughout, are especially conspicuous in these final sections of her book, as she sets out to chart Mary's struggle to earn badly needed money for herself, her stolid and disappointing son, and her distinguished but perpetually indigent father in the only way available to her: through her writing. As heroic in its way as Walter Scott's determination to pay off his creditors with the proceeds from yet another novel, it was further complicated by what became her crying - and unsatisfied - need once more to love and be loved in return.</p> <p>Mary Shelley's journals after Shelley's death make painful reading. By September 1824, an undeniable deep grief for the partner she had lost, rendered worse by her own sense of having failed him during his last years, was merging with cries that \"now I am not loved - I never never shall be loved more - never o never more shall I love . . . - never more shall I be happy - never more feel life sit triumphant in my frame - I am a wreck.\" She had already made the first of what were to prove many attempts to find \"Another Companion!\": not of course another Shelley - he was irreplaceable and unique - but someone with less transcendent qualities to whom, nevertheless, she could devote herself during what remained of her life. (She was then only 27.) \"I cannot live,\" she moaned in September 1826, \"without loving &amp; being loved.\" The various men on whom in the course of time she seems to have placed her hopes (Bryan Proctor, Aubrey Beauclerk, John Howard Payne, Washington Irving, Prosper M\u091drim\u091de) tended to want too much from her, remain elusive or abruptly marry someone else. Most depressing of all was her late romantic fixation on the Italian adventurer Ferdinando Gatteschi, to whom she gave sums of money she could ill afford, and from whom she was eventually obliged to extract compromising personal letters of her own under a threat of blackmail.</p> <p>The most excruciating disappointment, however, stemmed from a woman not a man. Jane Williams had shared those last months in Italy and, whatever Mary Shelley may have felt at the time about her husband's attentions to this attractive musician to whom he addressed some of the most yearningly exquisite of his late lyrics, once back in England she herself became \"excessively\", as she admitted, attached to her. Jane was her \"sole delight\", and although aware from the start that her own affection was stronger than Jane's, she nonetheless felt for a time that she lived \"to all good &amp; pleasure only thro' her\". Their relationship foundered when Mary learned, first that without confiding in her at all, Jane had married Thomas Jefferson Hogg, by whom she was pregnant, and then that she had spread ugly tales about the unhappy marriage of Percy and Mary Shelley, and how greatly Mary's coldness had been to blame. That, given her own remorseful feelings about their last years together, was to inflict a particularly grievous wound.</p> <p>Seymour tells this story of betrayal well. She is also able, largely thanks to Betty Bennett's painstaking and brilliant recovery of the history of Walter Sholto Douglas, as set out in her book Mary Diana Dods: A Gentleman and a Scholar (1991), to illuminate Mary Shelley's proud assertion, in her journal for October 1828, that although she may never have written as her mother did, \"to vindicate the Rights of women, I have ever befriended women when oppressed - at every risk I have defended and supported victims to the social system\". The story of Mary Diana Dods, the illegitimate and, in conventional terms, unattractive daughter of a Scottish earl, who assumed both a male identity and masculine dress, and passed herself off successfully for some time in Parisian society as the husband of Isabel Robinson, and father of 'their' child, is remarkable in itself. But it is also remarkable that the Mary Shelley who increasingly tried to bury her own irregular past, and declared in 1838 that \"since I lost Shelley I have no wish to ally myself to the Radicals - they are full of repulsion to me\" should nevertheless have gone far beyond any radical brief by supporting Mary Diana, of whose lesbian orientation she must have been entirely aware, to the extent of welcoming her transvestism and even being instrumental in negotiating a forged passport in 1827 for 'Walter' and his 'wife'.</p> <p>Mary Shelley was inclined, following Shelley's death, to become a bit 'tousy-mousy' (as she enigmatically put it) for women. Although her own fiction after Frankenstein and Matilda carries a somewhat dispiriting freight of gentle and inevitably golden-haired charmers, their self-sacrificing attentions entirely focused on men, she did once tentatively suggest, in her novel Lodore (1835), a very different scenario. Fanny Derham in that book, a young woman of superior intellect and learning, is described as \"more made to be loved by her own sex than by the opposite one\". But she hovers on the outskirts of the plot, never fully integrated into it, and Mary Shelley interestingly refuses to tell her story: \"What the events are that have already diversified her existence, cannot now be recounted; and it would require the gift of prophecy to foretell the conclusion. In after times these may be told.\" One would certainly rather hear more about Fanny than about Lodore's daughter, the saintly and unconvincing Ethel, but as Caroline Gonda has wittily remarked (in the special Mary Shelley issue of Women's Writing, 1999), \"like Sherlock Holmes's encounter with the Giant Rat of Sumatra, it seems, the tale of Fanny Derham is a story for which the world is not yet prepared.\"</p> <p>Miranda Seymour says about Fanny Derham only that \"she declares with Mary's own passion the importance of championing oppressed women.\" With Lodore, as elsewhere in writing about Mary Shelley's fiction, she is primarily concerned to sketch plots, then identify various autobiographical elements: Lodore himself as a portrait of Byron, Ethel's intense relationship with her father as a reflection of Mary's with Godwin, Ethel and Edward Villiers's attempts to evade the London bailiffs as mirroring Shelley's financial predicament in 1814, Lady Santerre as a portrait of Lady Shelley, even the reformed Cornelia Lodore, in the second half of the book, as a projection of Mary. Although Seymour briefly suggests that Lodore should not be dismissed as just another 'silverfork' novel, she never really addresses herself to its peculiarities or to the question of its artistic merits. A similar shying away from engagement with Mary Shelley's work, except as it comments on her life, is evident throughout this (again) not-very-literary biography. Seymour has, of course, a particular excuse for writing (in Barrell's terms) yet another 'new novel': the compulsively self-reflexive nature of Mary Shelley's fictions - a tendency increasingly marked after the early Frankenstein. Her novels might indeed be classified as a form of very literary biography.</p> <p>How good are they, when viewed in detachment from their author's life? A hint of what might be Seymour's actual opinion surfaces when she observes of the short critical-biographical notes on Italian, Spanish and French literature that Mary Shelley wrote over a period of some five years in the 1830s that she may well have felt \"this kind of work suited her as well as, and possibly better than 'romancing',\" adding, significantly, that \"few readers today would disagree, if they were able to sample her contributions to the Lardner Cyclopaedia, long out of print.\" (The Lardner Lives are not represented in the fine 1996 Pickering and Chatto edition of Mary Shelley's works, under the general editorship of Nora Crook.) Seymour's reservations here were anticipated by Muriel Spark in her own crisply excellent Mary Shelley (revised edition, 1988), a book neatly divided between biography and literary criticism, which praises the Lives while finding only Frankenstein, The Last Man and isolated passages in Perkin Warbeck worth serious attention among the fictions. That, however, is not at present a fashionable view.</p> <p>The bicentenary of Mary Shelley's birth, 1997, generated a number of conferences and publications in her honour. Academic journals produced special Mary Shelley issues, and two other collections have now appeared, one edited by Betty Bennett and Stuart Curran, the other by Michael Eberle-Sinatra. Much recent Mary Shelley criticism, as might be expected, is specifically feminist in orientation, some though not all of it concerned with the way her fictions shadow her own life and that of various people she knew. Other writers address her editing, travel books and reviews, or else explore her novels as comments on current affairs. A certain amount, perhaps less persuasively, is psychoanalytic. (Do we gain much by being told that Frankenstein's Creature - looked at closely - is a daughter, that the shudder which convulses its limbs as it awakens into life is an orgasm, or that what Matilda beholds when she discovers her drowned father's body in the cottage on the beach, 'something stiff and straight' covered by a sheet, is undeniably a phallus?) There is some excellent and fresh new work in the various anthologies - the Gonda piece, for instance, William St Clair on The Impact of Frankenstein, Michael O'Neill on Mary Shelley as an editor, Charles Robinson on Mathilda as Dramatic Actress (the last three in the Bennett/Curran collection) or Nora Crook intelligently defending the revised 1831 Frankenstein in Eberle-Sinatra. But, for some readers, nagging doubts are likely to remain about the stature of Mary Shelley's work as a whole. </p> <p>There is a case for adding Matilda to Frankenstein and The Last Man as a major achievement. A novella that remained unpublished until 1959 (Godwin, to whom Mary sent the manuscript from Italy, suppressed it, understandably horrified by the implications of its incestuous father/daughter relationship), it is powerful in some of the same visionary ways that Frankenstein and The Last Man - especially Book Three of the latter - are powerful. Part of the trouble with the others stems from Mary Shelley's clumsiness with dialogue. Her characters tend to speak in long, stilted paragraphs and, however impressive her historical research (as in Valperga and Perkin Warbeck), she is rarely convincing in her portrayal of human relationships other than those of a most extreme and unusual kind. Hence her success with Frankenstein and the Creature, or Matilda and her father, but failure with the happy de Lacey family in Frankenstein, or with the love of Perdita and Raymond in The Last Man. Where all her novels shine is in the evocation of place, whether the rigours of the frozen north, or, more usually, the varied landscape of Italy.

Not all readers will be convinced. That Mary Shelley was capable of sharply turned and acerbic comment is incontrovertible. Laughter is another matter. To have christened one of her two heroines in Valperga 'Euthanasia' is indicative enough. It was like her also to believe that the fifth act of The Cenci was Shelley's finest work, and to take so strongly against his scintillating jeu d'esprit The Witch of Atlas, apparently because it contained \"no human interest\", that her husband was moved to address a reproachful poem to her on the subject. One sometimes wonders whether, as she made all those fair copies for Byron of cantos of Don Juan, a smile ever crossed her lips. Certainly she manages, in her note on Shelley's Peter Bell the Third, to avoid any suggestion that the poem might be funny, not simply designed for the \"instruction and benefit\" of the world. Having registered this, however, one is likely at once to feel churlish. There wasn't, after all, a great deal in Mary Shelley's eventful but tormented life for her to laugh about: from Mary Wollstonecraft's death (caused by complications resulting from her own birth), her problematic relations with Godwin and with her stepmother and stepsister, the suicides of her half-sister and of Shelley's first wife, the deaths of three of her small children, followed by the uneven years with Shelley, his drowning, and the long, dreary aftermath in England in which she was left to live with her remorse and, finally, only a devoted daughter-in-law for support.

More than a decade later, in Footsteps: Adventures of a Romantic Biographer (1985), he recalled how obsessive his engagement gradually became, not just with Shelley, but with that whole group of English expatriates associated with him, as it moved from Geneva through Italy - Bagni di Lucca, Este, Venice, Rome, Naples, Ravenna, Pisa - shedding some members and adding others, before finally disintegrating when Shelley and Edward Williams were drowned off Leghorn in July 1822. Shortly thereafter, Byron and Trelawny embarked for Greece, Mary Shelley's troubled and troubling step-sister Claire Clairmont departed to become a governess in Russia, and in 1823 Mary and her last surviving child returned to the England she had not seen since 1818. \"The pursuit,\" Holmes confessed, \"became so intense, so demanding of my own emotions that it continuously threatened to get out of hand. When I travelled alone I craved after intimacy with my subject, knowing all the time that I must maintain an objective and judicial stance. I came often to feel excluded, left behind, shut out from the magic circle of his family. I wanted to get in among them, to partake in their daily life, to understand what Shelley called 'the deep truth' of their situation . . . Indeed I came to suspect that there is something frequently comic about the trailing figure of the biographer: a sort of tramp permanently knocking at the kitchen window and secretly hoping he might be invited in for supper.\" Holmes ends with a generalisation about 'the trailing figure of the biographer', but it is significant that it should be the Shelley m\u091dnage - in a book that also explores his biographical 'intimacy' with Robert Louis Stevenson, G\u091drard de Nerval and Mary Shelley's remarkable mother Mary Wollstonecraft - that occasions the reflection. There is something about 'the Shelley circle', and particularly its bizarre life abroad, that produces this effect. At its most extreme, it can lead to such a reductio ad absurdum as I am Mary Shelley, a book published in 1977, whose author Barbara Lynne Devlin claims to be her reincarnation and, with the help of an obliging medium, revisits Mary's past, informing the inquisitive readers that (yes) she did - though only once - go to bed with Byron and it was predictably wonderful (\"holding me in his fine, strong arms\" etc), whereas sex with Shelley's long-time friend Thomas Jefferson Hogg was quite revolting (\"He slobbered!\") Rather more soberly, Holmes in 1992 seems to have exorcised his own Shelleyan ghosts by writing a radio play about the last weeks at Casa Magni, that beach-house dangerously close to the sea at San Terenzo that Shelley loved and Mary (who by now was emotionally estranged from her husband, and suffered a near-fatal miscarriage there) detested. (To the Tempest Given appeared last year, in Holmes's collection Sidetracks: Explorations of a Romantic Biographer.) The material, based on letters and other biographical evidence, is enough to haunt anybody: the weird and isolated building, with too many people crammed together in it; Shelley's desperate but successful attempt to staunch Mary's haemorrhage by plunging her up to the waist in ice: his flirtation with Jane Williams (with whom Mary herself was later to fall in love); his nightmares of strangling Mary and of the sea overwhelming the house; various hallucinations including the one about meeting his own double, who asked him disconcertingly, \"How long do you mean to be content?\"; then the anguished days while the women waited for news of the little boat in which Shelley, Edward Williams and their cabin-boy had set sail from Leghorn, followed by the ghastly cremations on the beach. Miranda Seymour, in the preface to her new biography, Mary Shelley, confesses to having perpetrated, some twenty-five years ago, a novel (Count Manfred) about Byron. That is by no means unusual. Novels in which Byron appears more or less thinly disguised began during his own lifetime with Lady Caroline Lamb's Glenarvon of 1816. (\"I read Glenarvon too, by Caro Lamb,\" Byron remarked sourly after it was sent to him on the Continent. \"God damn.\") Mary Shelley herself would contribute several to the list. And they continue to be written. Shelley has received less fictional attention than Byron, although the American poet Elinor Wylie (1885-1928) did produce an embarrassing prose fantasy, The Orphan Angel, in which Shelley is rescued from the sea by a passing American schooner, and spends the rest of his life on that side of the Atlantic, without ever managing to communicate his whereabouts to anyone at home. Peter Ackroyd's Milton in America (1996) seems curiously, if perhaps unconsciously, parasitic on this earlier extravaganza. Milton, however, despite some fleeting fictional attention from Robert Graves, has never been able to vie with the Romantics in this respect. That perhaps has something to do with the degree to which many of the latter fictionalised themselves in their own work, thus offering an open invitation to later writers to extend the process. It also reflects the strikingly 'novelistic' character of many of their lives. John Barrell has observed acutely (in the LRB of 2 November 2000) that so-called literary biography seems now to have become markedly less 'literary', subordinating or virtually ignoring the work of the writer concerned, except insofar as it can be made to mirror the ups and downs, pleasures, pains and supposed secrets of his or her personal existence. This observation seems regrettably true and, although the balance is to some extent redressed by such excellent studies in the accurately entitled Literary Lives series (published by Palgrave) as Michael O'Neill's Percy Bysshe Shelley (1989) or Caroline Franklin's Byron (2000), not-very-literary biographies, some running to four hundred and more pages, continue to accumulate in the bookshops. There (presumably) they attract readers far more interested in the Romantics as personalities than in the works which, after all, are or should be the principal reason anyone at such a distance in time should want to revisit the lives of their authors. Inevitably, perhaps, these biographers often dress up speculations of their own as fact: that the young Wordsworth operated as a government spy, for instance, that Byron was a ruthless paedophile, or that Claire Clairmont in 1816 confessed that she had conceived a child by Shelley which he helped her to abort. For a variety of reasons, the life of Mary Shelley offers rich opportunities for fantasies of this kind, and it is very much to Miranda Seymour's credit that for the most part she declines them, or at least makes it clear that the hypotheses she does entertain are mere hypotheses. Her biography is level-headed, thorough, scholarly and consistently sympathetic to its subject without lapsing into hagiography. It is also lively and well-written. The notorious conundrums are all faced. Did Claire Clairmont at any of a number of possible points have an affair with Shelley? Who were the parents of Shelley's mysterious Neapolitan 'charge' Elena Adelaide, the short-lived infant he falsely registered as Mary's and his in February 1819? Exactly what caused his boat to go down in 1822: merely the squall, or was it rammed? Alternatively, did Shelley refuse to lower the sails in response to a sudden suicidal impulse? Did Mary's passionate relationship with Jane Williams after the two women returned to England become physically sexual? Seymour wisely refrains, given the continuing lack of evidence, from imposing answers. A few vaguenesses, or factual errors, mar the book. Closer attention, for example, to Marion Kingston Stocking's superb edition of The Clairmont Correspondence (1995) would have allowed Seymour to pinpoint more precisely than she does both Mary's first meeting with Byron, and the actual date (Saturday, 20 April 1816) Claire Clairmont finally manoeuvred him into bed. Seymour's statement that Thomas Moore \"had never bothered to read the memoirs which Byron gave him when he visited Venice in the autumn of 1819\", and so was entirely dependent in 1827, after they had been destroyed, on Mary Shelley's own account when writing his biography of Byron, is untrue. Unlikely in itself, it is contradicted by a letter of Moore's to Lord Holland in November 1821, in which he specifies the material he believes would need to be censored when the memoirs were eventually published. Her reference to Trelawny's dissolution of his \"brief marriage to a maid of Greece\", because she tried to abandon native dress for French fashions, rather glosses over the peculiarities - not to say, enormity - of the union itself. One wonders how much Mary Wollstonecraft's daughter ever learned about Trelawny's unfortunate child bride. And the 'Pisan affray' of 1822, of which Mary was a terrified witness - that very ugly skirmish with the dragoon Masi, probably instigated by the authorities in the hope of dislodging the Gamba family and their radical English associates from that part of Italy - could have done with more and sharper attention. In some ways, the second half of Seymour's biography, dealing with Mary Shelley's life between her husband's death in 1822 and her own in 1851, is the fresher and more arresting. This is a comparatively untrodden area. Understandably, the later years have always attracted far less attention than those during which the 16-year-old Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin eloped spectacularly with Shelley from Godwin's London house to the continent, came back to confront debt and estrangement from her father, then - established once more in Switzerland with Shelley - began Frankenstein during the famous ghost-story session with Byron, confronted the suicides of her own half-sister Fanny Imlay and of Shelley's wife Harriet after another return to England, and subsequently (now as Mary Shelley) took up that peripatetic existence in Italy which was to claim the lives of two of their three small children, and ended only when Shelley was drowned. It has sometimes been hard to remember that Mary Shelley's life continued for almost thirty years after that final catastrophe, extending well into the Victorian age. Her widowhood has never haunted biographers or moved them to long for admission to its various supper tables. Yet, as Seymour's book ably demonstrates, this period is in its way quite as extraordinary as the better known earlier one, and equally riddling. Seymour is excellent on the vexed subject of Mary's increasing conservatism: her eventual attempts to conceal something about which she had once been unabashed - that she lived with Shelley before they were actually married - her retreat from the atheism and the radical politics she had once shared with him, and her suppression or alteration, when editing his poetry and prose, of certain passages she came to regard as politically or sexually too outspoken. This was not simply a matter either of youthful unorthodoxy repudiated in age, or of response to the changing social climate in England. Compounded with those factors, at least for a time, was real fear lest she lose possession of her surviving child, Percy Florence, and of the meagre allowance granted the two of them by Shelley's appalling father. (Sir Timothy refused to the end of his days ever to meet her, and did his best to prevent publication of his son's work.) Seymour's respect and affection for Mary Shelley, attractively evident throughout, are especially conspicuous in these final sections of her book, as she sets out to chart Mary's struggle to earn badly needed money for herself, her stolid and disappointing son, and her distinguished but perpetually indigent father in the only way available to her: through her writing. As heroic in its way as Walter Scott's determination to pay off his creditors with the proceeds from yet another novel, it was further complicated by what became her crying - and unsatisfied - need once more to love and be loved in return. Mary Shelley's journals after Shelley's death make painful reading. By September 1824, an undeniable deep grief for the partner she had lost, rendered worse by her own sense of having failed him during his last years, was merging with cries that \"now I am not loved - I never never shall be loved more - never o never more shall I love . . . - never more shall I be happy - never more feel life sit triumphant in my frame - I am a wreck.\" She had already made the first of what were to prove many attempts to find \"Another Companion!\": not of course another Shelley - he was irreplaceable and unique - but someone with less transcendent qualities to whom, nevertheless, she could devote herself during what remained of her life. (She was then only 27.) \"I cannot live,\" she moaned in September 1826, \"without loving &amp; being loved.\" The various men on whom in the course of time she seems to have placed her hopes (Bryan Proctor, Aubrey Beauclerk, John Howard Payne, Washington Irving, Prosper M\u091drim\u091de) tended to want too much from her, remain elusive or abruptly marry someone else. Most depressing of all was her late romantic fixation on the Italian adventurer Ferdinando Gatteschi, to whom she gave sums of money she could ill afford, and from whom she was eventually obliged to extract compromising personal letters of her own under a threat of blackmail. The most excruciating disappointment, however, stemmed from a woman not a man. Jane Williams had shared those last months in Italy and, whatever Mary Shelley may have felt at the time about her husband's attentions to this attractive musician to whom he addressed some of the most yearningly exquisite of his late lyrics, once back in England she herself became \"excessively\", as she admitted, attached to her. Jane was her \"sole delight\", and although aware from the start that her own affection was stronger than Jane's, she nonetheless felt for a time that she lived \"to all good &amp; pleasure only thro' her\". Their relationship foundered when Mary learned, first that without confiding in her at all, Jane had married Thomas Jefferson Hogg, by whom she was pregnant, and then that she had spread ugly tales about the unhappy marriage of Percy and Mary Shelley, and how greatly Mary's coldness had been to blame. That, given her own remorseful feelings about their last years together, was to inflict a particularly grievous wound. Seymour tells this story of betrayal well. She is also able, largely thanks to Betty Bennett's painstaking and brilliant recovery of the history of Walter Sholto Douglas, as set out in her book Mary Diana Dods: A Gentleman and a Scholar (1991), to illuminate Mary Shelley's proud assertion, in her journal for October 1828, that although she may never have written as her mother did, \"to vindicate the Rights of women, I have ever befriended women when oppressed - at every risk I have defended and supported victims to the social system\". The story of Mary Diana Dods, the illegitimate and, in conventional terms, unattractive daughter of a Scottish earl, who assumed both a male identity and masculine dress, and passed herself off successfully for some time in Parisian society as the husband of Isabel Robinson, and father of 'their' child, is remarkable in itself. But it is also remarkable that the Mary Shelley who increasingly tried to bury her own irregular past, and declared in 1838 that \"since I lost Shelley I have no wish to ally myself to the Radicals - they are full of repulsion to me\" should nevertheless have gone far beyond any radical brief by supporting Mary Diana, of whose lesbian orientation she must have been entirely aware, to the extent of welcoming her transvestism and even being instrumental in negotiating a forged passport in 1827 for 'Walter' and his 'wife'. Mary Shelley was inclined, following Shelley's death, to become a bit 'tousy-mousy' (as she enigmatically put it) for women. Although her own fiction after Frankenstein and Matilda carries a somewhat dispiriting freight of gentle and inevitably golden-haired charmers, their self-sacrificing attentions entirely focused on men, she did once tentatively suggest, in her novel Lodore (1835), a very different scenario. Fanny Derham in that book, a young woman of superior intellect and learning, is described as \"more made to be loved by her own sex than by the opposite one\". But she hovers on the outskirts of the plot, never fully integrated into it, and Mary Shelley interestingly refuses to tell her story: \"What the events are that have already diversified her existence, cannot now be recounted; and it would require the gift of prophecy to foretell the conclusion. In after times these may be told.\" One would certainly rather hear more about Fanny than about Lodore's daughter, the saintly and unconvincing Ethel, but as Caroline Gonda has wittily remarked (in the special Mary Shelley issue of Women's Writing, 1999), \"like Sherlock Holmes's encounter with the Giant Rat of Sumatra, it seems, the tale of Fanny Derham is a story for which the world is not yet prepared.\" Miranda Seymour says about Fanny Derham only that \"she declares with Mary's own passion the importance of championing oppressed women.\" With Lodore, as elsewhere in writing about Mary Shelley's fiction, she is primarily concerned to sketch plots, then identify various autobiographical elements: Lodore himself as a portrait of Byron, Ethel's intense relationship with her father as a reflection of Mary's with Godwin, Ethel and Edward Villiers's attempts to evade the London bailiffs as mirroring Shelley's financial predicament in 1814, Lady Santerre as a portrait of Lady Shelley, even the reformed Cornelia Lodore, in the second half of the book, as a projection of Mary. Although Seymour briefly suggests that Lodore should not be dismissed as just another 'silverfork' novel, she never really addresses herself to its peculiarities or to the question of its artistic merits. A similar shying away from engagement with Mary Shelley's work, except as it comments on her life, is evident throughout this (again) not-very-literary biography. Seymour has, of course, a particular excuse for writing (in Barrell's terms) yet another 'new novel': the compulsively self-reflexive nature of Mary Shelley's fictions - a tendency increasingly marked after the early Frankenstein. Her novels might indeed be classified as a form of very literary biography. How good are they, when viewed in detachment from their author's life? A hint of what might be Seymour's actual opinion surfaces when she observes of the short critical-biographical notes on Italian, Spanish and French literature that Mary Shelley wrote over a period of some five years in the 1830s that she may well have felt \"this kind of work suited her as well as, and possibly better than 'romancing',\" adding, significantly, that \"few readers today would disagree, if they were able to sample her contributions to the Lardner Cyclopaedia, long out of print.\" (The Lardner Lives are not represented in the fine 1996 Pickering and Chatto edition of Mary Shelley's works, under the general editorship of Nora Crook.) Seymour's reservations here were anticipated by Muriel Spark in her own crisply excellent Mary Shelley (revised edition, 1988), a book neatly divided between biography and literary criticism, which praises the Lives while finding only Frankenstein, The Last Man and isolated passages in Perkin Warbeck worth serious attention among the fictions. That, however, is not at present a fashionable view. The bicentenary of Mary Shelley's birth, 1997, generated a number of conferences and publications in her honour. Academic journals produced special Mary Shelley issues, and two other collections have now appeared, one edited by Betty Bennett and Stuart Curran, the other by Michael Eberle-Sinatra. Much recent Mary Shelley criticism, as might be expected, is specifically feminist in orientation, some though not all of it concerned with the way her fictions shadow her own life and that of various people she knew. Other writers address her editing, travel books and reviews, or else explore her novels as comments on current affairs. A certain amount, perhaps less persuasively, is psychoanalytic. (Do we gain much by being told that Frankenstein's Creature - looked at closely - is a daughter, that the shudder which convulses its limbs as it awakens into life is an orgasm, or that what Matilda beholds when she discovers her drowned father's body in the cottage on the beach, 'something stiff and straight' covered by a sheet, is undeniably a phallus?) There is some excellent and fresh new work in the various anthologies - the Gonda piece, for instance, William St Clair on The Impact of Frankenstein, Michael O'Neill on Mary Shelley as an editor, Charles Robinson on Mathilda as Dramatic Actress (the last three in the Bennett/Curran collection) or Nora Crook intelligently defending the revised 1831 Frankenstein in Eberle-Sinatra. But, for some readers, nagging doubts are likely to remain about the stature of Mary Shelley's work as a whole. There is a case for adding Matilda to Frankenstein and The Last Man as a major achievement. A novella that remained unpublished until 1959 (Godwin, to whom Mary sent the manuscript from Italy, suppressed it, understandably horrified by the implications of its incestuous father/daughter relationship), it is powerful in some of the same visionary ways that Frankenstein and The Last Man - especially Book Three of the latter - are powerful. Part of the trouble with the others stems from Mary Shelley's clumsiness with dialogue. Her characters tend to speak in long, stilted paragraphs and, however impressive her historical research (as in Valperga and Perkin Warbeck), she is rarely convincing in her portrayal of human relationships other than those of a most extreme and unusual kind. Hence her success with Frankenstein and the Creature, or Matilda and her father, but failure with the happy de Lacey family in Frankenstein, or with the love of Perdita and Raymond in The Last Man. Where all her novels shine is in the evocation of place, whether the rigours of the frozen north, or, more usually, the varied landscape of Italy. She is at her finest when Lionel Verney, in The Last Man, is left as the sole human survivor of the plague, and wanders through noiseless and unpopulated cities, particularly Rome at the end, where the grass grows between the stones of the streets, and only the colossal wreck of a civilisation is to be seen. The other problem is Mary Shelley's lack of a sense of humour. This deficiency is one her admirers have indignantly denied as \"a canard\", pointing to her acceptance of such nicknames as 'Pecksie' or 'Maie', her unchaperoned excursion to the opera in London with Jane Williams, when the two of them pretended to be Italian ladies, and giggled a lot, or to those rather ponderously 'light' short stories Roger Dodsworth: The Reanimated Englishman or The Bride of Modern Italy. Not all readers will be convinced. That Mary Shelley was capable of sharply turned and acerbic comment is incontrovertible. Laughter is another matter. To have christened one of her two heroines in Valperga 'Euthanasia' is indicative enough. It was like her also to believe that the fifth act of The Cenci was Shelley's finest work, and to take so strongly against his scintillating jeu d'esprit The Witch of Atlas, apparently because it contained \"no human interest\", that her husband was moved to address a reproachful poem to her on the subject.

The Nuremberg trial after the second world war and its associated proceedings produced a rule of international law that states have a duty to prevent and punish crimes against humanity. That legal obligation was soon spelled out, in respect of the most wicked of all such crimes, by article one of the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide. By this treaty, states pledged themselves to act immediately to stop any systematic attempts to destroy an ethnic or racial group by mass murder, starvation and the like.

This continued for 12 weeks, and some 900,000 non-combatant civilians were killed. The daily death rate is estimated to have been more than five times that of the Nazi concentration camps at their murderous peak.

His report reveals that the UK actually urged a pull-out of the existing but inadequate Unamir force, and even rejected a United States proposal to send a fact-finding mission to the region once the death toll reached six figures. Worst of all, in Carissen's view, was the refusal of the permanent members (led by Britain) \"to acknowledge that the mass murder being pursued in front of the global media was a genocide\". The consequence of the failure to strengthen Unamir may be judged by the fact that the UN commander on the ground, General Dallaire, estimated (when the death toll was still in five figures) that he could curb it with 5,500 more crack troops.</p> <p>The case for an inquiry into the decision-making behind government policy on Rwanda is further strengthened by revelations in a new book, A People Betrayed - The Role Of The West In Rwanda's Genocide, by journalist Linda Melvern.

      "bodyText": "Peter Mandelson's glittering political career collapsed for the second and final time over an unnecessary act of deception - his fatal refusal to be frank with the Prime Minister about his role in brokering a British passport for a \u00a31m donor to the Millennium Dome. On Wednesday of last week, in a day of high drama not equalled at Westminster since Mr Mandelson's previous resignation, over his secret home loan in 1998, the man who helped to craft New Labour's modernising image for 15 years stepped down as the Northern Ireland Secretary and renounced all strategic responsibility for the coming general election. In an hour-long meeting Tony Blair and the man who had been his most trusted aide discussed why the media, the Prime Minister's spokesman, Alastair Campbell, and ministers were misled for 48 hours about Mr Mandelson's single phone call to Mike O'Brien, the immigration minister, in June 1998. Mr Mandelson, the MP for Hartlepool, insisted that he had done nothing improper, but accepted that he had not told the whole truth about his intervention in the application for naturalisation by Srichand Hinduja, a wealthy Indian businessman, known as S P. After revelations in the Observer, Mr Mandelson insisted that he had merely asked his private office to pass on a request for information regarding a possible application from Mr Hinduja to the Home Office in June 1998. In fact he made the crucial two-minute phone call in person. In the same month S P and his brother Gopichand, who was granted British citizenship in 1997, offered to sponsor the faith zone at the Millennium Dome. Mr Mandelson, as the Cabinet Office minister, was in charge of the project. The coincidence prompted opposition MPs to accuse the minister of selling a passport in return for what turned out be a \u00a31m contribution, which was formally announced in October 1998. In his resignation statement Mr Mandelson denied acting improperly, but admitted: \"I do accept that when my office spoke to a Sunday newspaper at the weekend I should have been clear that it was me personally, not my officials, who spoke to a Home Office minister.\" He also attacked the media for its relentless vilification of his political role as a pro-European, pro-Lib-Lab moderate, and for its interest in his private life. Norman Baker, the Liberal Democrat MP whose Commons questions prompted Mr Mandelson's evasive answer to the Observer, established that both brothers were turned down for UK passports in 1990, apparently because they had not spent enough time in Britain. The newspapers were united in not mourning Mr Mandelson's passing, but they all felt that in European terms the winners were the Eurosceptics, and in this context the Chancellor, Gordon Brown. \"The Cabinet has lost its most passionate pro-European,\" said the euro-supportive Financial Times, \"and Mr Blair has been left more vulnerable.\" Some of Mr Blair's friends had said they feared it would make Mr Brown over-powerful, especially in decisions such as whether Labour would call a referendum on the euro if re-elected. In the Commons William Hague gleefully denounced Mr Blair's \"monumental error of judgment\" in giving his old friend a second chance in 1999. Mr Blair quickly appointed a leading QC, the former Treasury counsel Sir Anthony Hammond, to examine the way S P's passport was granted - although the Prime Minister told MPs that he and the Home Secretary, Jack Straw, were satisfied that it was properly done. The inquiry should be completed by early March. It was widely known at the time S P applied for a British passport that he and his brother could face charges in India over the acceptance of an alleged \u00a37m kickback from the Bofors sale of guns to the Indian army. Last week they were granted bail by an Indian court while the allegations are investigated, but were refused permission to leave the country. Later Keith Vaz, the Europe minister and Britain's most prominent Asian MP, became embroiled in the controversy when the Conservatives tabled a clutch of parliamentary questions about his involvement with the Hindujas. Sir Anthony's inquiry will now include letters written by Mr Vaz to the Home Office asking about progress on the Hindujas' applications for UK passports. Extensive contacts between the billionaire brothers and ministers were then detailed by a meeting-by-meeting account released by the Department of Trade and Industry. The Trade and Industry Secretary, Stephen Byers, authorised publication of the list as officials, mindful of how Mr Mandelson's evasiveness cost him his career, insisted that the department wanted to be open. But when the Guardian applied for a copy of the official record of the key conversation between Mr Mandelson and Mr O'Brien over the passport application, the Home Office refused to publish it. A former adviser to the brothers explained their attitude to politicians, both Labour and Conservative, revealing that the Hindujas see them \"as a commodity to trade with\". Events deteriorated last weekend when Mr Straw spearheaded a Cabinet assault on Mr Mandelson in the wake of his decision to launch a fightback to clear his name. \"There is no doubt by his own admission that he told an untruth,\" Mr Straw said. His criticism was echoed by the International Development Secretary, Clare Short. \"Peter Mandelson went last Wednesday because he has got problems telling the truth,\" Ms Short said. \"Peter Mandelson is over.\" In an article in the Sunday Times Mr Mandelson said he had been forced to resign after a \"summary exploration of limited available evidence\" about his role in the affair. Downing Street's attempts to distance itself from Mr Mandelson played a hand in persuading him to put his side of the saga on the record. He highlighted the end of his political alliance with Mr Blair when he wrote of how he lost the will to fight for the first time in his life during their fateful meeting. \"I felt isolated,\" he wrote. \"I knew I hadn't done anything wrong, but I had no time to prove it. I agreed to resign and the Prime Minister - understandably, given the presentation of the facts - did not try to dissuade me. I should have fought for time to allow a fuller examination of the facts.\" However, Mr Mandelson's lengthy article only served to tarnish his reputation further after he admitted that a week before his resignation Mr Straw had reminded him of the telephone conversation with Mr O'Brien.

He has claimed his memory may have been hazy because of the burden of the peace process. \"Part of the problem, and Peter would accept this, I think, is that there were things that Peter cannot explain and cannot explain to himself,\" Mr Campbell said. \"I think he has been slightly detached.\"",

That's why the demonstrations against the manager and the board that supports him was so passionate after the defeat against Everton. We're fed up, not just with the manager, but a board that takes all the advantages of Premiership status and converts them into ashes. We are not a well-run club. And that explains why we struggle.",

Poets such as Pope, Dryden and Johnson took it on themselves to \"English\" and modernise the ancient classics: Virgil, Homer, Juvenal, Horace. </p> <p>It would overstate things to say we are living through something equivalent in film. It's more a flavour of the month thing. None the less, over the past few years, movie-makers have exerted themselves to \"cinema\" a corpus of classic literary texts. It goes beyond mere adaptation. Ang Lee's Sense and Sensibility (1995) takes liberties with Jane Austen's text, but remains faithful to Regency period, costume, dramatis personae and the novel's dialogue. Clueless (1995), by contrast, is transparently derived from Austen's Emma, but transposed to a Valley-girl, Beverly High setting. </p> <p>Emma was still there in Amy Heckerling's script, but as a kind of floating essence. One smelled it on the film, like some expensive fragrance. It was a new and rather flattering experience for 1990s audiences. Once you caught on, you felt exceptionally sophisticated - a literate film-goer, capable of relishing sly in-jokes that the director was directing in your direction. Clueless was also, in its own right, a witty comedy of southern California manners (in the Buffy the Vampire Slayer class, I would say, and a cut or two above Prom Night). </p> <p>The runaway success of Clueless has been one trigger for the current vogue for \"versioning\" (as literary critics like to call it). Another was the successful 1988 versioning of Dickens's A Christmas Carol as Scrooged (starring Bill Murray as the old skinflint in modern TV producer clothes). The bandwagon rolled on with Great Expectations (frosty Gwyneth Paltrow, lusty Ethan Hawke, grizzled De Niro as an improbable Magwitch) and 10 Things I Hate About You, the 1999 update of Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew, transposed, like Clueless, to the scatty world of the American high school. </p> <p>The most complex of these recent versionings is A Thousand Acres (1997). Jocelyn Moorhouse's film is an adaptation (fairly faithful) of Jane Smiley's novel, itself a modern recasting of Shakespeare's King Lear. Old man, three daughters, time to split up the estate, trouble. </p> <p>There must have been an elite in the audience who both knew the play and had read the 1992 novel. Watching the film was, in fact, something of a critical ordeal because, if you were really hip to this kind of thing, you would also be running Kurosawa's versioning of Lear, Ran (1985), through your head. One staggered out of the cinema after watching A Thousand Acres aesthetically knackered. Movies really shouldn't be such hard work. </p> <p>My own preference is for versionings that make the audience work a bit for the payoff. Films, that is, whose core literary in spiration is not released as part of the advertising package. The Coen brothers' O Brother, Where Art Thou?, was, one gradually apprehended, based on the Odyssey. But so delicate were the Homeric allusions (as in John Goodman's cyclopean eye, or the slag-sirens in the river) that one was never quite sure. Perhaps those naughty Coens were pulling our leg? Surely this belly-laugh Grapes of Wrath burlesque couldn't be a homage to the noblest of literary epics? Could it? </p> <p>My favourite versioning film just about makes it into the third division of cult classics. Marco Brambilla's Demolition Man (1993), starring Wesley Snipes and Sylvester Stallone, transposes Aldous Huxley's Brave New World to southern California (\"San Angeles\"), 30 years hence, after the Big One. As in Huxley's dystopia, it's a world without conflict or friction. </p> <p>The Stallone character, John Spartan (John Savage in the book), is thawed out of his cryo-penitentiary to perform his usual bull-in-a-china-shop act. Conflict and friction up the kazoo. It's very funny, not least because Stallone seems to be laughing at his own Rambo excesses. But since Huxley's novel is still in copyright (unlike King Lear) the film-makers were careful to keep any parallels at the level of subtext. The effect was delicious: Demolition Man was Die Hard crude and Citizen Kane subtle at the same time. </p> <p>All of which brings us to The Claim, a versioning of Thomas Hardy's The Mayor of Casterbridge. There's no question where this movie is coming from. Pre-release publicity has hammered home the point. The novel, published in 1886, is one of Hardy's \"satires of circumstance\" (\"life's a bitch, and then you die\"). </p> <p>A vagrant farm labourer, Michael Henchard, gets drunk at a fair in early 19th-century Wessex and sells his wife and child to a passing sailor. Hardy picked the story up from old newspapers. When he sobers up, Henchard swears off drink for 21 years and goes to a distant part of the west country. By way of hard work and ruthlessness he monopolises the corn wholesaling trade in the town of Casterbridge and becomes its mayor. It is the early 1840s, and Wessex - protected by the Corn Laws - is the bread basket of England. </p> <p>Enter a new man, Donald Farfrae, a Scot on his way to Canada's prairies (the world's bread basket, as they will be). Fatally, Henchard befriends Farfrae. Hardy's is a Darwinian universe. The new man must destroy the old. It's the law of life. Farfrae usurps Henchard's business and succeeds him as mayor. </p> <p>Fate - as remorseless as in Greek tragedy - plays its part. The sold wife, now a widow, returns. The great circle turns, Henchard dies what he was 21 years before: a drunk and a day-labourer. It being Hardy, there is a further irony. In 1846, a couple of years on, the Corn Laws will be repealed. Farfrae too will be destroyed and with him, Wessex prosperity. Life sucks. </p> <p>The British director of The Claim, Michael Winterbottom, and his British script writer, Frank Cottrell Boyce, have transposed Hardy's story to a later period, the 1860s (the time of the great transcontinental American railroad) and another west country - Sierra Nevada. The lineaments of the plot are the same, although names have been changed. Daniel Dillon, a \"forty-niner\", sells his wife. He strikes it rich and rules over the town he has made, Kingdom Come. Enter the New Man, Dalglish, a surveyor laying the railway. Enter the sold wife. So it goes. </p> <p>The makers of the film have retained Hardy's Darwinism, but give it - perversely - a final upbeat spin. Producers hate unhappy endings. The achievement of Winterbottom's film is essentially visual. It is a photographer's movie. What the audience takes away from the film is a series of vivid snapshots - many (as in Gladiator) the product of computer-generated imagery. </p> <p>The narrative is dominated by panoramic snowscapes (there's more ankle-deep trudging in this movie than in Scott of the Antarctic). There's a pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance sequence in which Dillon's house is physically moved, like a gigantic wedding cake, to its new location. Old towns are burned down, new towns spring up in stunning montage. At times, one can't believe one's eyes. A price is paid. The story, Hardy's story, is buried in all the visual effect, like a flower in a snowdrift. </p> <p>The Claim is a ponderous, self-important film, which is glorious to look at. Myself, I prefer Demolition Man. What do we go to the movies for? Literature? </p> <p>\u0095 The Claim is released tomorrow.

This is a serious national problem.\"</p> <p>The Healthcare Financial Management Association, which represents NHS finance directors, said that it was \"difficult to see how the targets would be met.\"</p> <p>A Department of Health (DoH) spokesman said: \"We have made a historic commitment to the NHS to increase funding by one third over five years and we expect health authorities to meet spending out of this.\"</p> <p>Last March, chancellor Gordon Brown announced a 6.1% average annual real terms increase for the NHS worth around \u00a319bn over four years, a move dubbed the biggest ever increase in health service history. Ministers claimed they had moved the debate away from finance and onto reform - reform that was subsequently spelled out in last summer's NHS Plan. </p> <p>But managers are privately describing negotiations for 2001-02 as the \"toughest ever\". </p> <p>The NHS confederation said that despite the extra billions ploughed into the service by the government, the coming year looked \"as tight as ever financially\".</p> <p>Andrew Foster, a confederation policy director, said: \"There are pressures and it will not be easy to meet all the objectives.

      "bodyText": "The NHS faces \"serious\" financial difficulties, less than a year after the government announced a \u00a319bn increase in NHS funding, with managers warning that they will struggle to find the resources needed to meet key government targets in areas such as cancer and waiting times. Budget problems, which have arisen just months after ministers triumphantly declared the debate over NHS funding was dead, threaten to re-ignite a potentially explosive debate over the financing of health care in the run-up to a general election. Managers say they are labouring to agree budgets for the next financial year and blame higher than expected costs of implementing the welter of initiatives and instructions handed down from ministers, who are anxious to push ahead with NHS modernisation plans announced last summer. They have warned ministers that health authorities and trusts can only meet the cost of national performance targets, drug costs, staff pay awards and the NHS reform programme over the coming months at the expense of running up huge deficits. One chief executive of a major trust told the Guardian: \"The sums simply don't add up. This is a serious national problem.\" The Healthcare Financial Management Association, which represents NHS finance directors, said that it was \"difficult to see how the targets would be met.\" A Department of Health (DoH) spokesman said: \"We have made a historic commitment to the NHS to increase funding by one third over five years and we expect health authorities to meet spending out of this.\" Last March, chancellor Gordon Brown announced a 6.1% average annual real terms increase for the NHS worth around \u00a319bn over four years, a move dubbed the biggest ever increase in health service history. Ministers claimed they had moved the debate away from finance and onto reform - reform that was subsequently spelled out in last summer's NHS Plan. But managers are privately describing negotiations for 2001-02 as the \"toughest ever\". The NHS confederation said that despite the extra billions ploughed into the service by the government, the coming year looked \"as tight as ever financially\". Andrew Foster, a confederation policy director, said: \"There are pressures and it will not be easy to meet all the objectives. There are a lot of must dos - 4% on pay, 2% on pensions (meeting the) junior doctors' (pay deal) - and there is a set of very ambitious targets.' The settlement for the coming year will see all health authorities receive cash increases of at least 7.8%, with the average rise being 8.5%. But managers say ministers and their officials have underestimated unavoidable cost pressures, leaving insufficient growth funds to implement everything on ministers' NHS Plan wish list. According to the DoH, the basic increase of 7.8% breaks down into 4.9% for the increased costs of pay, pensions, general inflation and the costs of implementing recommendations on new drug treatments from the National Institute for Clinical Excellence. The remaining 2.9%, equivalent to around \u00a31bn, was to implement the NHS Plan. But trusts and health authorities claim that real terms inflation for the NHS is closer to 6%, fuelled by high pay rises for staff, including a new deal for junior doctors, and increased pension costs - an overshoot on core, unavoidable costs that has eaten deep into money intended to implement the NHS Plan. The DoH has also ring-fenced about \u00a31bn within health authority allocations, reflecting the sums it estimates will have to be spent nationally to deliver key targets and milestones on cancer and coronary heart disease (\u00a3450m), waiting times and access (\u00a3423m), intermediate care (\u00a3188m) and information technology (\u00a3113m). Many health authoritities say that even delivering on their share of these spending requirements leaves them in a deficit position. The NHS faces a plethora of management targets, including the introduction of 24-hour catering facilities, setting up ward budgets, making progress on the mental health national service framework, and investing in improving hospital cleanliness - all of which carry significant costs. In the meantime, the NHS Executive's regional offices are reminding health bodies that they must break even in 2001-02, a feat that is expected to be achieved in the current year for the first time in many years. Mark Millar, chairman of the Healthcare Financial Management Association, said: \"The government has acknowledged that 2.9% is the real purchasing power. The feedback from the service is that the true purchasing power is less than 2.9% and it is difficult to see how all the targets can be hit. But it is still a work in progress.\"",

DoH is taking two initiatives that you might be interested in. Firstly we are launching this week a new campaign to tackle discrimination and stigma associated with mental illness and we are working closely with employers on this campaign. Secondly we are later this year developing a new service for people with a mental illness to provide better support for them in the workplace. There is a lot still to do but I think we are making moves in the right direction. </p> <p><strong>gooded</strong><br>The guidelines on local authority charging for care services have just been released for consultation. There seems to be a number of contradictions and policy changes. </p> <p>I am disabled, I use personal assistants to provide my care and I'm lucky enough to have a full-time job. </p> <p>In paragraph 52 it states that any charging policy should not be a disincentive to work. However, the document goes on to say that up to 55% of your income can be assessed for charging. The document seems to follow the charging policy of the Independent Living Fund (ILF) rather than the current policies of the majority of local authorities. Under this policy there are disabled people working full-time for only part-time wages with the rest going on care costs. This is contra to equal opportunities policy in employment. </p> <p>In paragraphs 48 &amp; 49 this covers joint incomes. Currently guidelines on the HASSASSA act 1983 states that only the service users income is taken into account when calculating care costs and not the spouse or partners. Again however, the new guidelines seem to follow the ILF policy of allowing spouse/partners income to be assessed for charges. Under this policy there are disabled people working full-time for nothing as all of their income is being spent on their care costs. </p> <p>Can the minister give an undertaking that working disabled people on average salaries should be allowed to retain all of their salary? As do non-disabled people. </p> <p>Can the minister give an undertaking that the current guideline on service user only charging will be retained and not to include the spouse or partner. </p> <p>Finally, it's the ILF and its charging policy that is out of step with the majority of local authority charging policies, and the ILF should change to meet these standards rather than the local authorities taking on the ILF policy. </p> <p><strong>John Hutton</strong><br>Hi. The document you refer to is a consultation document and obviously we want to hear what people have to say about these changes. We are trying to make the system fairer particularly for those on low or fixed incomes. </p> <p>The present situation is not acceptable and I think our proposals represent a positive step in the right direction but we haven't made any final decisions. On income levels it's worth bearing in mind that many authorities take all of a person's earned income into account in setting charges so therefore our proposals that only 55% should be taken into account would help remove the disincentive for disabled people to remain in employment. </p> <p>But once again we haven't made any final decisions about any of these important issues. Thanks for your views.</p> <p><strong>Adoptionnet</strong> <br> The government has said it wants to increase the number of adoptions by 1,000 in the next 4-5 years. </p> <p>Mr Hutton, how are local authorities expected to achieve this given that: a. most of the children available for adoption are older children (some of whom attract no inquiries at all from potential adopters despite extensive advertising) and many adoptive families only want to adopt babies - and go abroad if they can't do it in this country; b. There is a shortage of social workers to process applications from people interested in adopting and assess the children in the care system who may be best served by adoption? </p> <p>Are local authorities going to be expected to permanently remove children earlier and younger from their parents so that there is a greater supply of younger - and thereby less damaged - children who are more likely to be successfully adopted? </p> <p>How are local authorities expected to make the adoption of older children or those with special needs a more attractive proposition for families? </p> <p>Critics have said that the targets set in the adoption white paper on increases and speed of adoptions will be difficult to achieve and could work against the interests of children because of hurried and therefore badly matched placements. What do you say to those critics? </p> <p><strong>JohnHutton</strong><br> I believe our target for increasing the number of adoptions is a very realisable objective given that last year alone adoption increased by nearly 20% and when you consider that some local authorities are placing between 10 and 15% of looked-after children for adoption but others are only managing 1-2%, there is obviously scope for significant improvement. </p> <p>The white paper has announced additional resources for adoption services which will help. But no we will not require local authorities to remove children earlier and younger from their parents. This would be quite wrong because any decision to take a child into care has to be based on the facts and the circumstances of each case. </p> <p>And finally it is worth bearing in mind that there are nearly 2,500 parents waiting to adopt and nearly 1,400 children waiting for a new family. The new national adoption register should help speed up the matching process. </p> <p><strong>taffimak</strong><br> Anna Climbie tragedy/child abuse<br> The problems started in the late 1970's when social work departments ditched common sense and experience for qualifications. </p> <p>As an Oxford don (ex-social worker) friend said to me about a notorious child abuse case some years ago, 'The trouble is that the social workers concerned were over qualified'. </p> <p>I wonder what Mr Hutton thinks? </p> <p><strong>JohnHutton</strong><br> No I don't think social workers are over qualified. I think in particular social workers who work with children need better qualifications in future and we will be making some announcements soon about this. In all professions however there can never be a substitute for common sense. </p> <p> <strong>dogstar23</strong> <br>John, are you able to confirm whether or not the national service framework for older people will be published before the election? It has now exceeded the expected original publication date by almost one year. Is ageism rife in the DoH in spite of the statements made in the NHS plan? </p> <p> <strong>JohnHutton</strong> <br> The NSF will be published in the next few weeks. And by the way it is not a year late. We have always said that it would be publised by the end of the year 2000, but it will be worth the wait as it will tackle age discrimination head on. </p> <p> <strong>Harvey Gallagher</strong><br> Does the minister think the requirements of children and young people are adequately protected under the proposed changes to the Mental Health Act and will the final version mention the interface with the Children Act and how/when the two legal instruments might be best used? </p> <p> <strong>John Hutton</strong><br> I think for the first time the recently-published white paper has attempted to set out how we can improve the safeguards for young people who might be faced with compulsory treatment for a mental health problem. </p> <p>Previous legislation has never made any specific provision for young people.

How are local authorities expected to make the adoption of older children or those with special needs a more attractive proposition for families? Critics have said that the targets set in the adoption white paper on increases and speed of adoptions will be difficult to achieve and could work against the interests of children because of hurried and therefore badly matched placements.

As an Oxford don (ex-social worker) friend said to me about a notorious child abuse case some years ago, 'The trouble is that the social workers concerned were over qualified'. I wonder what Mr Hutton thinks? JohnHutton No I don't think social workers are over qualified. I think in particular social workers who work with children need better qualifications in future and we will be making some announcements soon about this.

We have always said that it would be publised by the end of the year 2000, but it will be worth the wait as it will tackle age discrimination head on. Harvey Gallagher Does the minister think the requirements of children and young people are adequately protected under the proposed changes to the Mental Health Act and will the final version mention the interface with the Children Act and how/when the two legal instruments might be best used? John Hutton I think for the first time the recently-published white paper has attempted to set out how we can improve the safeguards for young people who might be faced with compulsory treatment for a mental health problem. Previous legislation has never made any specific provision for young people. I think the measures we are proposing will certainly benefit young people and represent a real improvement on the present position. We made it clear in the white paper that we will continue to look at how we can improve these safeguards into the future so there is more work to be done.

      "body": "<p>NHS hospitals face massive increased costs after health officials appear to have underestimated the cost of the new pay deal for junior doctors aimed at reducing their working hours.</p> <p>A survey of hospitals in the NHS Northern and Yorkshire region, seen exclusively by SocietyGuardian.co.uk, puts the cost of the new deal at more than \u00a35,000 per junior doctor - far higher than was anticipated when the deal was introduced in December 2000. </p> <p>The survey suggests the total cost to the NHS in England - which employs 30,000 junior doctors - could reach as much as \u00a3150m in the first year.</p> <p>The findings, undertaken by consultants Pay and Workforce Research on behalf of human resources directors, were presented to the NHS HR director Hugh Taylor yesterday.</p> <p>Mr Taylor was told that the trusts surveyed in the region expect the pay system to cost an average of \u00a3771,031 or an average cost per junior doctor of \u00a35,281. </p> <p>Head of Pay and Workforce Research John Northrop said: \"On the findings of this survey it appears that the costs are far higher than expected and the numbers going into the top band have been grossly underestimated.\"</p> <p>But the Department of Health questioned the validity of the figures saying that only 17 out of 40 trusts were surveyed. It said it estimated the cost to the NHS of meeting the junior doctors' deal would be \u00a3150m over three years.</p> <p>Mr Northrop estimates the total cost of implementing the new pay system and increasing the number of staff in Northern and Yorkshire alone will reach a staggering \u00a338m. </p> <p>Much of the extra costs relate to trusts' estimates that they will each need an average of 17 additional junior doctors and four extra consultants to bring all juniors' hours below the 56-hour maximum, and become fully compliant with the new requirements. </p> <p>This could add a further \u00a317m to the \u00a321m cost of implementing the system in Northern and Yorkshire.</p> <p>Andrew Foster, HR policy director of the NHS confederation, said it was clear the increase in non-compliance was stumping up costs. \"This creates an affordability problem for organisations because there hasn't been that level of funding put in.\"</p> <p>The new junior doctors' pay deal came into effect in December 2000 and is expected to force NHS hospitals to start the process of reducing doctors' working hours to comply with European working time regulations. </p> <p>It spells the end of junior doctors' infamous payment system, which saw some doctors paid as little as half the normal hourly rate for overtime. Doctors now working more than 56 hours a week or without sufficient rest periods will receive a \"band 3\" 62% supplement to their basic pay. </p> <p>This will rise to 70% in December this year and 100% at the end of 2002. Doctors working between 48 and 56 hours a week (known as band 2) will initially receive a 50% boost to their pay. </p> <p>In November the Department of Health predicted a new junior doctor could earn \u00a325,890 or an extra \u00a31,700 as a result of the deal. A senior house officer could be paid \u00a343,140 or an extra \u00a32,800 compared with the old overtime system. </p> <p>But these estimates were based on doctors not exceeding the 56-hour maximum and so receiving the 50% supplement. As soon as the 56-hour maximum is breached those same doctors would see earnings rise to \u00a327,961 and \u00a346,591 respectively.</p> <p>Following a new assessment of doctors' working patterns, it is believed that more than 70% of junior doctors could be eligible for the top 62% supplement - twice as many as were deemed \"non-compliant\" before the deal was introduced. </p> <p>According to Dr Trevor Pickersgill, chairman of the British Medical Association's junior doctors' committee: \"We feel we are seeing the true number of doctors working outside the recommendations.\"</p>",

A survey of hospitals in the NHS Northern and Yorkshire region, seen exclusively by SocietyGuardian.co.uk, puts the cost of the new deal at more than \u00a35,000 per junior doctor - far higher than was anticipated when the deal was introduced in December 2000. The survey suggests the total cost to the NHS in England - which employs 30,000 junior doctors - could reach as much as \u00a3150m in the first year. The findings, undertaken by consultants Pay and Workforce Research on behalf of human resources directors, were presented to the NHS HR director Hugh Taylor yesterday. Mr Taylor was told that the trusts surveyed in the region expect the pay system to cost an average of \u00a3771,031 or an average cost per junior doctor of \u00a35,281. Head of Pay and Workforce Research John Northrop said: \"On the findings of this survey it appears that the costs are far higher than expected and the numbers going into the top band have been grossly underestimated.\" But the Department of Health questioned the validity of the figures saying that only 17 out of 40 trusts were surveyed. It said it estimated the cost to the NHS of meeting the junior doctors' deal would be \u00a3150m over three years. Mr Northrop estimates the total cost of implementing the new pay system and increasing the number of staff in Northern and Yorkshire alone will reach a staggering \u00a338m. Much of the extra costs relate to trusts' estimates that they will each need an average of 17 additional junior doctors and four extra consultants to bring all juniors' hours below the 56-hour maximum, and become fully compliant with the new requirements. This could add a further \u00a317m to the \u00a321m cost of implementing the system in Northern and Yorkshire. Andrew Foster, HR policy director of the NHS confederation, said it was clear the increase in non-compliance was stumping up costs. \"This creates an affordability problem for organisations because there hasn't been that level of funding put in.\" The new junior doctors' pay deal came into effect in December 2000 and is expected to force NHS hospitals to start the process of reducing doctors' working hours to comply with European working time regulations. It spells the end of junior doctors' infamous payment system, which saw some doctors paid as little as half the normal hourly rate for overtime. Doctors now working more than 56 hours a week or without sufficient rest periods will receive a \"band 3\" 62% supplement to their basic pay. This will rise to 70% in December this year and 100% at the end of 2002. Doctors working between 48 and 56 hours a week (known as band 2) will initially receive a 50% boost to their pay. In November the Department of Health predicted a new junior doctor could earn \u00a325,890 or an extra \u00a31,700 as a result of the deal. A senior house officer could be paid \u00a343,140 or an extra \u00a32,800 compared with the old overtime system. But these estimates were based on doctors not exceeding the 56-hour maximum and so receiving the 50% supplement. As soon as the 56-hour maximum is breached those same doctors would see earnings rise to \u00a327,961 and \u00a346,591 respectively. Following a new assessment of doctors' working patterns, it is believed that more than 70% of junior doctors could be eligible for the top 62% supplement - twice as many as were deemed \"non-compliant\" before the deal was introduced. According to Dr Trevor Pickersgill, chairman of the British Medical Association's junior doctors' committee: \"We feel we are seeing the true number of doctors working outside the recommendations.\"",

      "bodyText": "IPC has admitted it is reviewing its older man's magazine Later as part of a rebranding of its Music &amp; Sport portfolio. The portfolio is to be rebranded IPC ignite! in a move that managing director Mike Soutar says more accurately reflects the magazines within it. Mr Soutar admitted IPC had failed to come up with the \"killer application\" in the title, which was launched last year under editor Phil Hilton to provide a magazine for the ageing Loaded reader. \"We are committed to the magazine, but we don't think we've got it yet. We don't think we've got the killer application,\" he said. The long-predicted move follows the a series of developments at IPC, including the appointment of a new senior management team over the past year, the divestment of a clutch of sports titles and the closure of Melody Maker. Last week new Loaded editor Keith Kendrick said he planned to take Loaded to a more \"savvy\" marketplace, and wanted to appeal to more \"grown-up\" men. Mr Soutar confirmed that IPC was reassessing Later, which sold only 77,000 copies at the last ABCs. He said he would continue to \"revisit the editorial blueprints of all the products in IPC ignite!.\"",

More than half the \u00a3313m the BBC has allocated to new digital TV and radio services over the next two years will go to BBC3. The channel will be aimed at 16 to 34-year-olds and will focus on music, comedy, entertainment and contemporary drama programming. It is expected to showcase new talent, but also make use of established BBC1 and BBC2 stars. Mr Murphy, speaking yesterdat at a BBC presentation to independent TV producers, also revealed that BBC3 programme budgets would be between \u00a3120-140,000 an hour. What he was looking for, he said, was \"screwy and fucked up TV\" proposals. But he was also keen to stress that the plans for BBC3 still had to secure government approval. News that the BBC has held such a meeting is sure to further anger the corporation's commercial rivals, who have argued that the BBC is not waiting for culture secretary Chris Smith's official approval before going ahead with preparations for the new digital services. BBC1 controller Lorraine Heggessey, speaking at the same gathering, stressed that \"there is no hiding place\" for programmes to establish themselves, given the ever increasing competition from ITV and other channels. Ms Heggessey told producers that when they came to her with a new programme idea they had to be confident it would be able to survive against the likes of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?. She also called for more drama ideas, emphasising the lighter side of life. \"I'm not saying it's always raining in BBC drama, but we need to stress that there's a light side.\" Relevant stories Jan 18: BBC splashes out \u00a3300m on digital services Jan 18: What's on BBC3",

      "bodyText": "1. Put an anti-fraud and corruption strategy in place It may sound obvious, but more than 15% of councils have yet to do it. The commission describes these strategies as \"a basic component\" of an overall anti-fraud framework. One in five councils does not have a named police liaison contact with whom to raise fraud issues. 2. Make life easier for whistleblowers More than one in ten councils still does not have formal arrangements to comply with the whistleblower-protecting Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998. This means council employees can be reluctant to uncover problems because they lack confidence in their authority's ability to handle the complaint. Today's report calls on councils to improve this situation, and says they need to designate a senior officer to receive disclosures and protect the confidentiality of complainants. If whistleblowers suffer as a result of their disclosure, the council could face an industrial tribunal and payouts running into hundreds of thousands of pounds. 3. Use more technology The total number of staff employed in anti-fraud work has been rising for most of the last decade, but the number of internal audit staff - accountants who scan an authority's books - is in decline. The average number employed by councils in 1993 was 8.8. It was 7.9 last year. The commission says: \"It remains important that the reduced level of staff resources is compensated for by the increased use of technology.\" Techniques such as data-matching - comparing lists of benefit claimants with private sector pension data, for instance - are already having a huge impact in cutting down on fraud. 4 Sort out standards committees Under the Local Government Act 2000, every council will have to set up its own watchdog to set and monitor codes of conduct for politicians and local authority staff. More than 200 councils have done so in advance of the legislation coming into force, but many of them will have to review the composition and remit of their standards committees if they want to comply with the law. The act defines six roles for the committees, and no single council has yet met all of them. 5. Create an anti-fraud culture among councillors New Westminster-style council cabinets or directly elected city mayors will mean power is concentrated in the hands of fewer councillors than ever before. The commission says this could add new risks for councils in their fight against the fraudsters.

      "bodyText": "Yesterday McDonald's shocked upmarket sandwich-eaters across the UK by buying into the snack chain Pret a Manger. Now the king of junk food is jumping on the text message bandwagon in a bid to keep youngsters hooked on its diet of burgers and milk shakes. The year-long marketing initiative will launch in Germany next month and could be extended to the UK. In a joint venture with a mobile phone service firm, McDonald's will bombard consumers with text and voice messages. The fast-food chain is not planning to alert customers to discounts on its latest burgers but will use a more subtle marketing approach involving music and games for mobile phones, which will be branded by McDonald's and the Munich-based firm 12snap. The move follows on from its hugely successful in-store toy giveaways - a children's favourite. A spokeswoman for 12snap said it will consider rolling the initiative out to the UK and Italy, the other territories where the company operates. \"We are opening up completely new roads in marketing. We want to reach our customers through the most direct means - namely their mobile phones,\" added McDonald's Germany senior director of marketing Jeffrey Wahl. 'We are convinced the mobile phone will become an integrated component of the marketing mix in the future.\" If it takes off McDonald's could become the biggest text messager in Europe with millions of customers receiving free games. American Express has signed a similar deal with 12snap to advertise the financial giant's Blue credit card, which is aimed at young, affluent consumers. It is also the first time American Express has used text messaging for promotion. The explosion of text messaging for commercial purposes comes just days after figures showed 750m messages were tapped out over Christmas in the UK with more than 1m sent every hour in December. The phenonemon is already causing concern with a wireless marketing body, the Wireless Marketing Association (WMA), creating a charter for good practice in mobile marketing. The association is considering developing sanctions for companies that \"spam\" consumers with unsolicited messages. \"Because messages are \"pushed\" to a user, they can be intrusive, especially when users start to get bombarded with them,\" said Steve Wunker, CEO of Saverfone and chairman of the WMA. \"Mobiles are seen as a very personal space, and unwanted messages are often viewed as a real privacy violation. The key is for users to choose relevant services and request that they receive messages from them.\"",

      "bodyText": "The parents and relatives of people whose organs may have been stored in hospitals around the country face a wait of several months to have their questions answered. Thousands phoned hospitals that were listed by the chief medical officer yesterday as having collections of organs, while others sought information from NHS Direct. The helpline took more than 3,000 calls between midnight and 2pm yesterday. Hospitals have been instructed by the NHS executive to take the details of people who phone but not to try to tell them whether they hold any organs belonging to their relatives. Even hospitals that have comprehensive catalogues of what has been retained, and from whom, are not permitted to put relatives out of their misery until a national catalogue is compiled, which will take months. Yesterday Margaret Brazier, chairwoman of the retained organs commission - announced yesterday by the health secretary, Alan Milburn - said the moratorium not only on disposal but also on return of organs was needed to ensure that nobody else went through the trauma suffered by Alder Hey parents, some of whom endured several funerals as body parts were returned to them. \"I recognise that, for some parents, this will be a further, disappointing delay in what has already been a harrowing process for those involved,\" she said. \"But equally the risks of multiple burials and of setting off a drawn-out and highly distressing repeat of the problems experienced in Liverpool make it important that nothing should be released until the commission is satisfied that a comprehensive and secure cataloguing process has been completed.\" The edict will not go down well with some trusts, which are sure that they have full and proper records and could relieve the anxiety of some relatives promptly, but a Department of Health spokesman pointed out that Alder Hey, too, thought it had complete records when it was first approached. The chief medical officer, Liam Donaldson, revealed yesterday that hospitals and medical schools are holding some 105,000 organs, of which around 54,000 date from 1970 and will be returned, if families want that. Many hospitals set up telephone helplines to deal with inquiries. Derriford hospital in Plymouth, which has 268 adult organs, mostly brains, had 60 calls. Great Ormond Street in London, which holds one of the biggest collections - 3,800 children's organs - had 50 calls, while its child death helpline had 200. Oxford Radcliffe hospitals NHS trust, which has a store of 4,400 organs - the second biggest collection after Alder Hey - said it had received more than 150 calls yesterday morning. Southampton general hospi tal said it had 1,300 brains and 220 hearts retained for research on diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Alzheimers and congenital heart conditions. At a press conference, the director of nursing and patient services, Katherine Fenton, said the hospital was \"not an Alder Hey\". All the organs had been used for research and had been catalogued. The hospital said the brains kept were mostly those of adults and the hearts of children. These had been removed only for clinical reasons and never just removed and stored. Jim Lowe, of the University of Nottingham medical school, yesterday warned that medical research was already being seriously damaged by a new reluctance not only by families, but also coroners and the medical profession, to agree to the removal and retention of organs at postmortem examination. He said he feared that society would be the loser. A study in the Lancet last year indicated that 10% of death certificates were wrong. If pathologists are not able to remove and study organs, which may take some time, many more people will be buried or cremated with the wrong cause of death on the certificate, and many more relatives will not discover earlier that they are at risk of genetically inherited disease. Dr Lowe said that \"a loss of confidence in the postmortem\" began over a year ago, when it was revealed at the Bristol Royal Infirmary inquiry that hospitals had not returned children's hearts for burial. It was not the histopathologists who carried out the postmortem examinations who asked for permission from families for organs to be retained, but the doctor who cared for the person who had died and who had established a relationship of trust with the families. Now those doctors were less willing to ask, because \"they feel at this time it will be too intrusive and too painful\", Dr Lowe said.

      "body": "<p>Health watchdogs yesterday accused the government of hiding the misery of lengthy trolley waits in hospitals by failing to count the time patients were \"warehoused\" in accident and emergency departments before a doctor decided whether to admit them. </p> <p>A spot check by community health councils at 52 hospitals in London and the south-east on Monday found a 71-year-old woman who had waited for 23 hours 55 minutes at Whipps Cross hospital in Leytonstone, east London. But according to the Department of Health's records, she had waited only three hours 20 minutes; she was counted as a successful case handled within the official target time of four hours. </p> <p>The discrepancy rests with the department's calculation of waiting times. In this case, the wait began at 1.10pm on Monday when a doctor admitted the woman, who had a fractured tibia. But she had started waiting at 4.35pm the previous day in A&amp;E. </p> <p>Elizabeth Manero, chair of London Health Link, an association of CHCs, said: \"It is an affront to the patient, who is in pain and anxious to know what is to happen to them, to be told that their trolley wait does not count because they have not yet seen the doctor. </p> <p>\"The NHS will only really improve if the real experience of patients improves, not just the management figures which only tell half the story.\" </p> <p>The survey found that 27 of the 50 patients who had been waiting more than six hours in A&amp;E were over the age of 65. </p> <p>\"We need a fundamental redesign of the way elderly people in particular are treated - the current system is clearly failing them.\" </p> <p>The spot check also found a man aged 76 with abdominal pain who waited 12 hours 55 minutes on a trolley at Lewisham hospital, south London, but the official record put his wait at two hours 30 minutes. </p> <p>Nigel Crisp, chief executive of the NHS, challenged the accuracy of some of the CHCs' complaints. Some patients had been sent home and so could not be counted as waiting, and others needed care in a resuscitation unit or assessment in A&amp;E. These patients were not delayed because a bed could not be found for them. </p> <p>Mr Crisp said 90% of patients went into beds within four hours of a decision to admit them.

      "bodyText": "Health watchdogs yesterday accused the government of hiding the misery of lengthy trolley waits in hospitals by failing to count the time patients were \"warehoused\" in accident and emergency departments before a doctor decided whether to admit them. A spot check by community health councils at 52 hospitals in London and the south-east on Monday found a 71-year-old woman who had waited for 23 hours 55 minutes at Whipps Cross hospital in Leytonstone, east London. But according to the Department of Health's records, she had waited only three hours 20 minutes; she was counted as a successful case handled within the official target time of four hours. The discrepancy rests with the department's calculation of waiting times. In this case, the wait began at 1.10pm on Monday when a doctor admitted the woman, who had a fractured tibia. But she had started waiting at 4.35pm the previous day in A&amp;E. Elizabeth Manero, chair of London Health Link, an association of CHCs, said: \"It is an affront to the patient, who is in pain and anxious to know what is to happen to them, to be told that their trolley wait does not count because they have not yet seen the doctor. \"The NHS will only really improve if the real experience of patients improves, not just the management figures which only tell half the story.\" The survey found that 27 of the 50 patients who had been waiting more than six hours in A&amp;E were over the age of 65. \"We need a fundamental redesign of the way elderly people in particular are treated - the current system is clearly failing them.\" The spot check also found a man aged 76 with abdominal pain who waited 12 hours 55 minutes on a trolley at Lewisham hospital, south London, but the official record put his wait at two hours 30 minutes. Nigel Crisp, chief executive of the NHS, challenged the accuracy of some of the CHCs' complaints. Some patients had been sent home and so could not be counted as waiting, and others needed care in a resuscitation unit or assessment in A&amp;E. These patients were not delayed because a bed could not be found for them. Mr Crisp said 90% of patients went into beds within four hours of a decision to admit them. Over the past week, 30 people waited on trolleys for more than 12 hours, compared with 230 over the same period last year. \"We are getting better but we have still got work to do,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"We are not saying the Department of Health has deliberately distorted the figures,\" Ms Manero said. \"They are following a system introduced in 1995 to cut death rates of people waiting after doctors decide to admit them. But they're nervous about changing to a system showing the true wait.\" The department said that from next year it would start calculating waiting times from arrival in A&amp;E. Malcolm Alexander, chief officer of Southwark Community Health Council, who drew up the report, said: \"These figures are disgusting - what we are finding is a warehousing of patients in A&amp;E.\" Liam Fox, the shadow health secretary, said: \"We get a regular casualty watch produced by the CHCs and ... this is absolutely par for the course. [But] the CHCs are being abolished - the government is making sure that any independent monitoring of the health service is wiped out.\" Paul Burstow, Liberal Democrat spokesman for older people, said the patients' charter was not being honoured, and added: \"The abolition of CHCs means that this is the last winter we will have accurate records of trolley waits.\"",

      "bodyText": "The chief inspector of schools in England produced a report yesterday which he said offered no comfort to those, including William Hague, who wanted to abolish local education authorities. Mike Tomlinson's first big report, summing up the results of 91 LEA inspections, criticised the unacceptably wide variation in services and said most councils had little effect on school standards. But unlike his predecessor, Chris Woodhead, who questioned whether LEAs should exist at all, Mr Tomlinson defended the part they played in organising school admissions and transport. \"They do have important roles in strategic planning across an area which could never been taken by an individual school,\" Mr Tomlinson said. \"The report gives no comfort to those who believe that the existence of LEAs serves no purpose. It does not support the abolitionist argument. Nor does it support some of the more exaggerated claims made by LEAs.\" The chief inspector's comments amounted to criticism of the Tory \"free schools\" policy, which would, in effect, abolish LEAs. But Mr Tomlinson denied he was being being party political. Estelle Morris, the school standards minister, hailed the success of the inspections, introduced by the government in 1997.

The government has \"outsourced\" - privatised - some or all services in 18 poor-performing education authorities. Ms Morris said she would continue to encourage even \"authorities in a position of relative strength\" to outsource some services when required. The best performing authorities were, according to the Ofsted report: the corporation of London, Coventry, Kensington and Chelsea, Warwickshire, Lewisham, Birmingham, Oxfordshire, Hammersmith and Fulham, Hartlepool, Newham, Wandsworth, Barking and Dagenham, York, North Yorkshire, Solihull, Hertfordshire, Camden and Bury.",

It was confirmed that his world heavyweight title defence against Hasim Rahman will be shown live on BBC1, and it was soon clear that the corporation is determined this will not be a one-off guest appearance. The fight, on April 21, now seems more likely to be staged in Monaco than Las Vegas, and the BBC is trying to reach agreement with the American TV company HBO for a live showing in Britain, after Match of the Day, with a screening on tape delay in the United States. Assuming the viewing figures are as healthy as the BBC management expects, it is reasonable to suggest that the BBC will try to make the most of options built into the contract for Lewis to have further fights on the network, possibly two before the end of the year. Sky TV, which has covered all Lewis's title fights to date, would be favourite to outbid all competitors if he is finally able to entice the former champion Mike Tyson into the same ring, but the BBC director of sport Peter Salmon was keen to emphasise that the corporation is serious about challenging Sky's market dominance. \"It is not always the greatest amount of money which secures the deal,\" said Salmon. \"There is a whole range of other issues to consider, and the BBC is able to offer a magnificent sportsman such as Lennox an unrivalled profile.\" Salmon suggested, with justification, that Lewis might be watched on April 21 by a television audience 10 times the size of that he would expect on Sky, and the champion himself seemed genuinely excited by the prospect. \"It will give everybody the chance to see me, and see for themselves just how much I have improved.

Now, even at this late stage in his career - Lewis is 35 - that could all change and the BBC is sure to explore the possibility of working jointly with pay-per-view operators, which would enable it to compete with Sky for the rights to major fights, with recorded action to be shown on BBC terrestrial channels. Pay-per-view sales on Sky of recent Lewis contests against Michael Grant and David Tua were disappointing, and even his two meetings with Evander Holyfield failed to match the 600,000 audience the satellite broadcasters achieved for Frank Bruno's 1996 world title defence against Mike Tyson.

      "bodyText": "A parcel bomb packed with nails which exploded yesterday morning in a charity shop is believed to be the latest in a series of attacks by animal rights activists. The device went off as a volunteer at the British Heart Foundation shop in Penrith, Cumbria, opened the morning post. The woman was shocked but uninjured, police said. It is the tenth device sent to premises in northern England and Wales and comes amid warnings from the home secretary, Jack Straw, that the government intends to crack down on intimidation from animal rights protesters. The incident comes as a judge at Peterborough crown court jailed an animal rights activist for six months after she admitted sending threatening letters to employees of the animal research company Huntingdon Life Sciences. Charlotte Lewis, 28, of Thornton Heath, Surrey, admitted four charges of harassment against current and former employees of HLS. The court heard how unemployed Lewis was arrested after forensic scientists matched her DNA to saliva on the back of stamps she had placed on envelopes. Christopher Morgan, for the prosecution, said that Lewis had written two letters which began with the words \"Dear Animal Abusing Scum\" and \"Dear Scum\". One letter warned: \"If you don't quit HLS then your life will not be worth living. You will always have to be looking over your shoulder.\" The other said: \"This is a warning. Your life is in grave danger if you don't stop working at HLS. You will find yourself having a gun aimed at your stupid ugly head.\" In mitigation, David Heraghgy, defending, said the animal rights campaigner did not have \"a violent bone in her body\" and had no intention of carrying out the threats. But Judge Pollard said Lewis's crimes were so serious and the letters had had such an effect on the recipients that a jail sentence was necessary. He said Lewis would serve three months in prison and then be released on licence. A spokesman for Cumbria police said of yesterday's nail bomb that no one had claimed responsibility for the incident but they believed it, and other recent attacks, to be the work of animal rights extremists. The police spokesman said: \"What we can say is we are aware, because of our liaison with other forces, that previous incidents were perpetrated against people with connections to the agricultural animal industry.\" The tactics employed by animal rights activists have changed since the early 1990s, moving away from isolated incidents towards targeted campaigns of direct action. A number of small separate cells are believed to use the internet to coordinate their activities. It is not known if these cells are involved in the recent nail bomb attacks. Robin Webb, spokesman for the Animal Liberation Front, has consistently denied that his organisation has had any role in the recent parcel bomb incidents. Police are taking the attacks so seriously they are coordinating efforts by linking incident rooms across the country - only the third investigation of its kind in history. Nine forces are now involved in the investigation. The inquiry, called Operation Package is being coordinated by North Yorkshire police and led by the deputy chief constable, Peter Walker. Yesterday's explosion came just one day after the discovery of two nail bombs which were safely defused by the army. One of the packages was sent through the post to agricultural suppliers on the outskirts of Sheffield. The second was sent to a Cancer Research Campaign shop in Lancashire. In December last year a six-year-old girl was injured when she opened a package at her father's pest control business in Congleton, Cheshire. In another incident earlier this month a woman received severe facial injuries when a device sent to an estate agents in Patrington, East Yorkshire, exploded as she opened the envelope it was concealed in. Letter bombs have also been sent to other businesses including a chip shop, a pet shop and a farmer in Ripon, North Yorkshire, at the beginning of this year.",

      "bodyText": "Ministers could be forced to extend negotiations with the consortium seeking to buy the millennium dome after Legacy yesterday admitted it could miss the St Valentine's Day deadline. The potentially embarrassing delay follows protracted discussions with the government over plans to tighten clauses guaranteeing the public purse a share of any profits. Dome minister Lord Falconer yesterday met Legacy executives Robert Bourne and Richard Barrett with the government competition team handling the negotiations. Afterwards, Legacy conceded the talks may not be concluded by February 14, the deadline set last month by both sides. But the consortium insisted the deal was still on track and predicted the sale would go ahead before the election. \"We're not going to get hung up on the date,\" said a Legacy spokesman. \"Things are progressing well.\" The company has opened an exhibition in Greenwich, south-east London, to secure planning permission to change the dome from an entertainment complex into a business park, and this week released a 3D disc of its proposals. Lord Falconer's department refused to comment last night but Downing Street is known to be anxious to conclude ne gotiations with Legacy before the election in an attempt to stop the dome becoming a campaign issue. Deputy PM John Prescott, who will ultimately decide if the deal goes ahead, is expected to meet Lord Falconer to review progress. Ministers are understood to have tried to raise the \u00a3125m price by an estimated \u00a315m after offering to increase the site involved from 48 to 63 acres. The negotiations are also advancing slowly over the \"clawback clauses\" with ministers wanting to share in any money made if Legacy sells the dome on or wins planning permission for hundreds of homes. Appointed \"preferred bidder\" after Japanese bank Nomura dropped out last year, Legacy's plans to turn the dome into a hi-tech knowledge city have been questioned by rivals. The consortium has yet to sign up any tenants and has been caught out talking up the interest of firms, suggesting they were committed to renting space when they had only suggested they might. Legacy is fronted by Labour donor Mr Bourne but is 80% Irish-owned, Mr Barrett's Dublin-based Treasury Holdings emerging recently as the major shareholder. Waiting in the wings if the Legacy bid collapses are property firms and PY Gerbeau who wants to turn the dome into a venue for concerts.",

The Bush administration, however, is in no hurry to do this, especially as it is under pressure from families of US victims.</p> <p>President George Bush said yesterday: \"I want to assure the families, the government will continue to pressure Libya to accept responsibility for this act and to compensate the families.\"</p> <p>Libya insisted yesterday that it was not to blame. Its UN envoy, Abuzed Omar Dorda, stressed that no link had been established with the government and \"Libya is not responsible\".</p> <p>A new UN resolution will be needed to end the sanctions and the US will be able to use its veto as a member of the security council to block this.</p> <p>Mr Bush faces twin pressures: on one side the Lockerbie families and on the other US oil companies anxious to get back into Libya. A British official said: \"There are some differences with the US over nuances.

      "bodyText": "A split between Britain and the US emerged yesterday over the lifting of United Nations sanctions imposed on Libya after the Lockerbie bombing. The Foreign Office, which believes in engagement with countries once regarded as \"rogue\" states, is keen to end the economic measures as soon as possible. The Bush administration, however, is in no hurry to do this, especially as it is under pressure from families of US victims. President George Bush said yesterday: \"I want to assure the families, the government will continue to pressure Libya to accept responsibility for this act and to compensate the families.\" Libya insisted yesterday that it was not to blame. Its UN envoy, Abuzed Omar Dorda, stressed that no link had been established with the government and \"Libya is not responsible\". A new UN resolution will be needed to end the sanctions and the US will be able to use its veto as a member of the security council to block this. Mr Bush faces twin pressures: on one side the Lockerbie families and on the other US oil companies anxious to get back into Libya. A British official said: \"There are some differences with the US over nuances. The US is less inclined to be pinned down on what is to be done.\" The 1992 UN resolution which imposed the sanctions said Libya had to cease terrorism, hand over the two suspects for trial, disclose all it knew about the bombing, accept responsibility for the actions of its officials, pay compensation and cooperate with a French inquiry into the 1989 bombing of a UTA airliner over Niger.

He was head of airline security for Libyan Arab Airlines, giving him knowledge of security precautions at airports.</p> <p>The judgment said Megrahi appeared to have been involved in military procurement.</p> <p>The day before the bombing, he arrived in Malta using a false passport, with no apparent reason for the visit. He left Malta for Tripoli the following day.

      "bodyText": "In their 82-page written judgment, the judges said there was no evidence that anyone other than Libyans was involved in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing. They said they were convinced that the suitcase containing the bomb began its journey at Luqa airport in Malta. \"While no doubt organisations such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Command and the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front were also engaged in terrorist activities during the same period, we are satisfied that there was no evidence from which we could infer that they were involved in this particular act of terrorism.\" The judges said they were convinced the crown had proved that the suitcase containing the bomb was despatched from Malta airport, passed through Frankfurt and was loaded on to Pan Am flight 103 at Heathrow. They said it was clear that, with one exception, the clothing packed in the suitcase was bought in Tony Gauci's shop in Malta on December 7 1988. Regarding Mr Fhimah, who was cleared of the bombing, the judges said the main evidence against him came from entries in his 1988 diaries about collecting Air Malta luggage tags. The prosecution maintained that Mr Fhimah had obtained the tags for Megrahi so that an unaccompanied bag could be placed on an aircraft. The judges said they did not accept witness evidence, from double agent Abdul Majid Giaka, that both accused men were seen arriving at Luqa airport with a suitcase on the day before the bombing. There was no evidence at all, said the judges, that Mr Fhimah was at Luqa airport on the day of the bombing. The judges said that in the case of Megrahi, a major factor against him was identification evidence by Mr Gauci, owner of Mary's House, the shop where clothing found in the bomb suitcase had been bought. The judgment said Mr Gauci was a reliable witness adding: \"From his evidence it could be inferred that the first accused (Megrahi) was the person who bought the clothing which surrounded the explosive device.\" They said the clothing had been bought on December 7 - the day Megrahi had arrived in Malta staying at a hotel close to Mary's House. \"If he was the purchaser of this miscellaneous collection of garments, it is not difficult to infer that he must have been aware of the purpose for which they were being bought.\" The judges accepted that Megrahi was a member of the Libyan Intelligence Services (JSO) - \"occupying posts of fairly high rank\". He was head of airline security for Libyan Arab Airlines, giving him knowledge of security precautions at airports. The judgment said Megrahi appeared to have been involved in military procurement. The day before the bombing, he arrived in Malta using a false passport, with no apparent reason for the visit. He left Malta for Tripoli the following day. The judgment said: \"It is possible to infer that this visit, under a false name, the night before the explosive device was planted at Luqa, followed by his departure for Tripoli the following morning at or about the time the device must have been planted, was a visit connected with the planting of the device.\" The judgment concluded: \"Having considered the whole evidence in the case... we are satisfied that the evidence as to the purchase of clothing in Malta, the presence of that clothing in the primary suitcase, the transmission of an item of baggage from Malta to London, the identification of the first accused (albeit not absolute), his movements under a false name at or around the material time, and the other background circumstances ... does fit together to form a real and convincing pattern. \"There is nothing in the evidence which leaves us with any reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the first accused.\" LINKS: The verdict Full text of the judges' verdict (pdf file) You will need Adobe Acrobat to view this file.

      "body": "<p>Two months before the Lockerbie disaster, German police arrested a group of people in Frankfurt, where the bag containing the bomb was placed on the Pan Am airliner.</p> <p>Among those seized in the operation was Hafez Dalkamoni, a prominent member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command (PFLP-GC), led by Ahmed Jibril and based in Syria's capital, Damascus.</p> <p>They also included Marwan Kreeshat, a Jordanian who was found with a Toshiba cassette player in his car. It was similar to the one containing the bomb which destroyed the Pan Am airliner.</p> <p>Kreeshat was released within days by the German police on grounds of lack of evidence. The decision astonished British intelligence agencies, who with their counterparts throughout the west, pointed the finger for the Lockerbie bombing squarely at the PFLP-GC.</p> <p>They believed the bombing was funded by Iran in retaliation for the mistaken shooting down of an Iranian airliner by an American warship, the USS Vincennes, over the Persian Gulf in July 1988. Had not Tehran radio declared that the incident would be avenged \"in blood-spattered skies\"?</p> <p>In the 1980s the PFLP-GC had close ties with Syria, then the only Arab country allied to Ayatollah Khomeini's Iran. Iran appeared to be further implicated in the bombing when a US national security agency report referred to Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, a former Iranian interior minister who supervised Iranian funding of Middle East terror groups, as paying out \"10m in dollars in cash and gold to bomb Pan Am Flight 103 in retaliation for the US shootdown of the Iranian Airbus\".</p> <p>The existence of the report, which was given to lawyers representing Pan Am, became known in 1995. This was after the two Libyans had been indicted and officials in Washington and London played down its significance.</p> <p>Yet this was not the only intelligence report implicating extremist Palestinian groups. A declassified counter-intelligence assessment produced by the US state department's diplomatic security section, dated December 2 1988, stated: \"According to [source blacked out] team of Palestinians not assoc with Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO) intends to atk [sic] US tgts in Europe. Timeframe is present.

      "bodyText": "Two months before the Lockerbie disaster, German police arrested a group of people in Frankfurt, where the bag containing the bomb was placed on the Pan Am airliner. Among those seized in the operation was Hafez Dalkamoni, a prominent member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command (PFLP-GC), led by Ahmed Jibril and based in Syria's capital, Damascus. They also included Marwan Kreeshat, a Jordanian who was found with a Toshiba cassette player in his car. It was similar to the one containing the bomb which destroyed the Pan Am airliner. Kreeshat was released within days by the German police on grounds of lack of evidence. The decision astonished British intelligence agencies, who with their counterparts throughout the west, pointed the finger for the Lockerbie bombing squarely at the PFLP-GC. They believed the bombing was funded by Iran in retaliation for the mistaken shooting down of an Iranian airliner by an American warship, the USS Vincennes, over the Persian Gulf in July 1988. Had not Tehran radio declared that the incident would be avenged \"in blood-spattered skies\"? In the 1980s the PFLP-GC had close ties with Syria, then the only Arab country allied to Ayatollah Khomeini's Iran. Iran appeared to be further implicated in the bombing when a US national security agency report referred to Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, a former Iranian interior minister who supervised Iranian funding of Middle East terror groups, as paying out \"10m in dollars in cash and gold to bomb Pan Am Flight 103 in retaliation for the US shootdown of the Iranian Airbus\". The existence of the report, which was given to lawyers representing Pan Am, became known in 1995. This was after the two Libyans had been indicted and officials in Washington and London played down its significance. Yet this was not the only intelligence report implicating extremist Palestinian groups. A declassified counter-intelligence assessment produced by the US state department's diplomatic security section, dated December 2 1988, stated: \"According to [source blacked out] team of Palestinians not assoc with Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO) intends to atk [sic] US tgts in Europe. Timeframe is present. Tgts specified are Pan Am Airlines and US mil bases\". The previous month, US security personnel were told to be on the lookout for an improvised explosive device (IED) concealed in a Toshiba radio recorder. \"Recently, an IED was found by a terror group search in Germany,\" said an internal memo dated November 1 1988. \"It was made into a Toshiba radio-recorder. During the security check of such devices that may be suspect, SPOs [security patrol officers] are warned not to switch these radios on or interfere in such a manner as to cause an electrical contact.\" A handwritten note on the memo added: \"Stay clear of Frankfurt airport until further notice. US-bound aircraft.\" US officials dismissed these reports of warnings as hoaxes, inaccurate intelligence, attempts by Pan Am to build up a case for their lawyers to sue the US authorities, or propaganda spread by Libya. Whatever the truth, evidence heard at the trial raised questions about what the members of group who were arrested and released in Germany two months before the Lockerbie bombing were up to. It emerged that Kreeshat had been jailed for 18 years in his absence for his part in placing a bomb in a record player on an El Al flight from Rome to Tel Aviv in 1972.

      "body": "<p>Abdel Baset al-Megrahi's conviction for murder is a spectre that is returning to haunt Libya - of the bad old days when it was a brutal exponent of state-sponsored terrorism.</p> <p>Colonel Muammar Gadafy's return to the civilised world is unlikely to be significantly impaired by yesterday's dramatic outcome at Camp Zeist, despite disagreements between the US and Britain over international sanctions.</p> <p>But the unanimous verdict - against a man described as a high-ranking member of Libyan intelligence - nevertheless throws an unwelcome spotlight on a government which, both before and after Lockerbie, did not hesitate to kill.</p> <p>In the 1970s and 1980s, Libya was synonymous with the concept of state-sponsored terrorism.</p> <p>Col Gadafy, who came to power in a military coup in 1969, regularly ordered the killing of opponents - \"stray dogs\" at home and abroad were eliminated.</p> <p>Britain experienced directly Libya's willingness to kill when, in 1984, PC Yvonne Fletcher was shot dead by Libyan security men firing at demonstrators outside the People's Bureau in London.</p> <p>The Libyan leader also supported an array of radical liberation movements, from the IRA through the Basque Eta movement to Palestinian extremists fighting Israel, especially the notorious Abu Nidal group.</p> <p>But if Libyan involvement was exaggerated, especially by a US always looking to score propaganda points against an opponent, it was none the less real.</p> <p>Libyan intelligence worked closely with the East German Stasi and received timers and bomb-making equipment from the same suppliers.

      "bodyText": "Abdel Baset al-Megrahi's conviction for murder is a spectre that is returning to haunt Libya - of the bad old days when it was a brutal exponent of state-sponsored terrorism. Colonel Muammar Gadafy's return to the civilised world is unlikely to be significantly impaired by yesterday's dramatic outcome at Camp Zeist, despite disagreements between the US and Britain over international sanctions. But the unanimous verdict - against a man described as a high-ranking member of Libyan intelligence - nevertheless throws an unwelcome spotlight on a government which, both before and after Lockerbie, did not hesitate to kill. In the 1970s and 1980s, Libya was synonymous with the concept of state-sponsored terrorism. Col Gadafy, who came to power in a military coup in 1969, regularly ordered the killing of opponents - \"stray dogs\" at home and abroad were eliminated. Britain experienced directly Libya's willingness to kill when, in 1984, PC Yvonne Fletcher was shot dead by Libyan security men firing at demonstrators outside the People's Bureau in London. The Libyan leader also supported an array of radical liberation movements, from the IRA through the Basque Eta movement to Palestinian extremists fighting Israel, especially the notorious Abu Nidal group. But if Libyan involvement was exaggerated, especially by a US always looking to score propaganda points against an opponent, it was none the less real. Libyan intelligence worked closely with the East German Stasi and received timers and bomb-making equipment from the same suppliers. In the mid-1980s some of it was found in West Africa. In 1986 it was the alleged bombing by Libyan agents of the La Belle discotheque in Berlin, targeting US military personnel, that brought the retaliatory bombing of Tripoli - most probably the reason for the Pan Am attack. And in 1991, when the Lockerbie indictments were issued, they included a wealth of information about the personnel and modus operandi of Libyan intelligence, some of whom had been involved in previous incidents. But perhaps the most striking continuities were with the bombing of a French UTA airliner over Niger in September 1989, in which 170 people died. Six Libyan secret service agents, including Abdullah Senussi, Gadafy's brother-in-law and intelligence chief, were eventually tried and convicted in absentia in a French court, with Tripoli paying millions of dollars in damages. But in the early 1990s Col Gadafy cleaned up his act. First came a cautious process of giving Britain information about the weapons Libya had supplied to the IRA, enabling the security forces to track down arms caches. After that the Libyan leader began to lessen his support for Palestinians, closing down their training camps and forcing Abu Nidal to flee first to Egypt and then Iraq. Ahmed Jibril's Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, initially suspected of the Pan Am bombing, also became an unwelcome guest. Col Gadafy also responded to the threat from Islamic fundamentalists at home, seeing them as a far greater threat to his secular regime than his old western enemies, most of whom were queueing to do business with him. Allegations made by the MI5 renegade David Shayler involved clandestine British support for an underground Islamic group. The Libyan leader's decision to hand over the Lockerbie suspects was seen as an important milestone in this process, as was his agreement to pay compensation in both the PC Fletcher and UTA cases. Analysts say Col Gadafy has largely given up on his fellow Arabs, whom he has accused of cutting deals with Israel, and has turned instead to Africa as a stage on which he can wield influence and play a larger role. \"Gadafy is paranoid about Islamic extremists and now sees them as the real threat,\" one well-placed diplomat said last night. \"In some ways he now has common cause with the people who used to be his enemies.\" But yesterday's verdict is an unpleasant reminder that, at least for the relatives of the Lockerbie victims, if not for the governments and companies anxious for business as usual, the terrorist slate has not yet been wiped clean. \"This was not just an indictment of Megrahi,\" insisted Brian Flynn, whose brother died in the 1988 bombing. \"It was made quite clear that he was acting as an agent for Libyan intelligence. That means we have to go after Libya as a state sponsor of terrorism.\" Col Gadafy will not be the first leader given a clean bill of health after being directly associated with acts of terrorism. Iran suffered the embarrassment of a trial which showed that its agents had murdered Kurdish dissidents in Berlin in the famous Mykonos case - and still won rehabilitation from Europe, if not the US. Syria, too, suffered isolation when one of its agents, Nezar Hindawi, was convicted in 1986 of trying to blow up an Israeli airliner at Heathrow by sending his pregnant and unwitting Irish girlfriend on board with a bomb. Britain severed diplomatic relations with Syria after that incident, but restored them later, arguing that it too had cleaned up its act.

      "body": "<p>The trail from the moment Pan Am flight 103 exploded over Lockerbie on December 21 1988 to yesterday's conviction of Libyan secret agent Abdel Baset al-Megrahi was complicated, circumstantial and occasionally uncertain - but undoubtedly true, according to the three judges in the case.</p> <p>\"There is nothing in the evidence which leaves us with any reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the first accused,\" they said.</p> <p>In their 82-page judgment, they said they were convinced that the suitcase containing the bomb began its journey at Luqa airport in Malta, where Megrahi and Al-Amin Khalifah Fhimah, who was acquitted, worked for Libyan Arab Airlines. Megrahi was also a member of the Libyan intelligence services \"of fairly high rank\", concluded the judges.</p> <p>\"The clear inference which we draw from this evidence is that the conception from a planning and execution of the plot which led to the planting of the explosive device was of Libyan origin,\" they said.</p> <p>The explosion that blew Pan Am flight 103 out of the sky marked Megrahi's involvement in the biggest mass murder in British history: all 259 passengers and crew on board died; 11 others were killed on the ground.</p> <p>Almost immediately, the suspicion that a bomb had brought down the jumbo was confirmed. The CIA and the FBI joined Britain's smallest police force and the secret services to mount the biggest criminal inquiry ever launched.</p> <p>Investigators discovered that the bomb was contained in a baggage container which was loaded at Frankfurt airport. Another clue came with the discovery of clothing and the charred remains of a Samsonite suitcase.</p> <p>Their next discovery was even more remarkable. A thumbnail-sized piece of circuit board stained with the residue of RDX and PTN - the chemicals left behind after a Semtex explosion - was found. The piece of circuit board came from an RTSF15 Toshiba radiocassette recorder. Eighty per cent of sales of this Toshiba model were in Libya.</p> <p>Forensic scientists came to the conclusion - a conclusion which the judges yesterday said was without doubt - that the bomb was housed in the Toshiba cassette recorder, packed inside the Samsonite suitcase. This in itself was remarkable, but what came next - a combination of forensic science and serendipity - was truly the stuff of detective fiction.</p> <p>More than 11,000 pieces of fabric were recovered from the wreckage of the plane, but among that wreckage forensic scientists were drawn to clothing stained with Semtex residue.</p> <p>One item bore the label Malta Trading Company. When German investigators checked through computer records, they discovered that baggage could have been transferred at Frankfurt on to flight 103A (the feeder for flight 103) from an incoming Air Malta plane. The search moved to the Mediterranean island.</p> <p>When they traced the manufacturer of the piece of clothing, investigators discovered that one of its outlets was Tony Gauci's tiny Mary's House store in the port of Sliema. Remarkably, Mr Gauci remembered selling the clothing to an Arabic man a few weeks before Christmas 1988.</p> <p>The man stuck in Mr Gauci's mind because he appeared to buy the clothing indiscriminately and paid little attention to either sizing or price. Mr Gauci had many dealings with customers from the Arab world and he could offer one further piece of information: the man's accent appeared to be Libyan. Airline receipts would later show that Megrahi was in Malta on December 7.</p> <p><b>Breakthrough</b><br></p> <p>Mr Gauci's evidence was a crucial factor in the case, the judges said. \"From his evidence it could be inferred that the first accused (Megrahi) was the person who bought the clothing which surrounded the explosive device.\"</p> <p>The next breakthrough was again the product of forensic detection. Among the rubble, the air accident investigation branch discovered another piece of circuit board. Detailed analysis showed it formed part of the timer used in the bomb. In time, detectives would discover it was an MST-13 timer manufactured by the Swiss firm MeBo - and testimony from the owner of this company, Edwin Bollier, gave the court a glimpse of the shadowy world of Megrahi's links to the international arms trade.</p> <p>At this point of the investigation, however, the trail began to go cold. It was not until 1991, in a US warship off the coast of Malta, that it would suddenly heat up again.</p> <p>In the summer of 1988, a Libyan named Abdul Majid Giaka presented himself at the American embassy in Malta claiming to be a disaffected member of the Libyan intelligence services, the JSO or joint security organisation. The CIA was immediately called and Giaka was recruited as a double agent. In exchange for payment of at least $1000 a month, Giaka - who worked alongside Megrahi and Fhimah at Malta's Luqa airport - gave information to the Americans.</p> <p>The information, however, was often not convincing. Under cross-examination at the trial, it became clear that Giaka had exaggerated his status within the JSO and had lied about his relationships with senior members of the service. The judges made it clear in their ruling that they did not find him to be a wholly reliable witness.</p> <p>The CIA were also uncertain of Giaka's worth: in cables released to the court the first time such sensitive material had been produced in a foreign court it be came apparent that the CIA had threatened to drop Giaka unless he came up with better intelligence.</p> <p>In the summer of 1991 the patience of Giaka's handlers finally snapped: they threatened to ditch him unless he agreed to a complete debriefing from US marshals. Giaka, by now desperate, agreed.</p> <p>The Libyan was taken to a US warship off the coast of Malta and it was there that he came up with his most damning evidence against Megrahi. Giaka told US officials that in 1986 he had been asked by the JSO to prepare a report on the possibility of planting a bomb on a British plane leaving Luqa.</p> <p><b>False passport</b><br></p> <p>The request was a response to Margaret Thatcher's decision to allow American bombers to use British airbases to launch a bombing raid on Tripoli and Benghazi. When Giaka told Megrahi - who was also a senior member of the JSO - about the report he replied: \"Don't rush things.\"</p> <p>But there was more damning evidence to come. On the day before the Lockerbie bombing, Giaka told investigators, he had watched Megrahi fly to Malta from Tripoli. He was travelling under a false passport in the name of Abdusamad. It was a pseudonym he used regularly on the trips he made to Malta on JSO business.</p> <p>When he arrived in Malta, Megrahi carried a brown Samsonite suitcase which had been stored in the cockpit of the plane. He took this suitcase unchecked through customs. He stayed only one night in Malta.</p> <p>Shortly after the Air Malta KM 180 plane carrying the Lockerbie bomb on its fateful journey left on the 21st, Megrahi boarded a Libyan Arab Airlines plane back to Tripoli.</p> <p>\"It is possible to infer that this visit under a false name the night before the explosive device was planted at Luqa, followed by his departure for Tripoli the following morning at or about the time the device must have been planted, was a visit connected with the planting of the device,\" said the judges.</p> <p>The judges were certain Megrahi carried the suitcase which housed the Lockerbie bomb, but no one could explain how it found its way on to the Air Malta flight before being transferred on to flight 103. But the crown did point out the overwhelming circumstantial evidence which had stacked up against Megrahi. It was enough to satisfy the judges.</p> <p>Tony Gauci, the Maltese shopkeeper who had sold the clothing found in the case which housed the bomb, was asked to look through a series of mugshots to see if he could identify the Arabic customer. He picked out a photograph of Megrahi. In court, however, Gauci would say only that the customer \"resembled a lot\" Megrahi. For the judges this was sufficient identification.</p> <p>In the end, though the judges found flaws in the evidence, they saw that it fitted together \"to form a real and convincing pattern\". It was enough to bring the Libyan who planted the Lockerbie bomb to justice, but not enough to tell the full story of the atrocity. Questions remain. Who ordered the planting of the bomb? Did Britain and the US know it was going to happen? Those are questions for which we will probably never find answers.</p> <p>LINKS: <b>The verdict</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk/guardian/pdf/0131lockerbieverdict.pdf\" target=\"_new\">Full text of the judges' verdict (pdf file)</a><br> You will need Adobe Acrobat to view this file.

      "bodyText": "The trail from the moment Pan Am flight 103 exploded over Lockerbie on December 21 1988 to yesterday's conviction of Libyan secret agent Abdel Baset al-Megrahi was complicated, circumstantial and occasionally uncertain - but undoubtedly true, according to the three judges in the case. \"There is nothing in the evidence which leaves us with any reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the first accused,\" they said. In their 82-page judgment, they said they were convinced that the suitcase containing the bomb began its journey at Luqa airport in Malta, where Megrahi and Al-Amin Khalifah Fhimah, who was acquitted, worked for Libyan Arab Airlines. Megrahi was also a member of the Libyan intelligence services \"of fairly high rank\", concluded the judges. \"The clear inference which we draw from this evidence is that the conception from a planning and execution of the plot which led to the planting of the explosive device was of Libyan origin,\" they said. The explosion that blew Pan Am flight 103 out of the sky marked Megrahi's involvement in the biggest mass murder in British history: all 259 passengers and crew on board died; 11 others were killed on the ground. Almost immediately, the suspicion that a bomb had brought down the jumbo was confirmed. The CIA and the FBI joined Britain's smallest police force and the secret services to mount the biggest criminal inquiry ever launched. Investigators discovered that the bomb was contained in a baggage container which was loaded at Frankfurt airport. Another clue came with the discovery of clothing and the charred remains of a Samsonite suitcase. Their next discovery was even more remarkable. A thumbnail-sized piece of circuit board stained with the residue of RDX and PTN - the chemicals left behind after a Semtex explosion - was found. The piece of circuit board came from an RTSF15 Toshiba radiocassette recorder. Eighty per cent of sales of this Toshiba model were in Libya. Forensic scientists came to the conclusion - a conclusion which the judges yesterday said was without doubt - that the bomb was housed in the Toshiba cassette recorder, packed inside the Samsonite suitcase. This in itself was remarkable, but what came next - a combination of forensic science and serendipity - was truly the stuff of detective fiction. More than 11,000 pieces of fabric were recovered from the wreckage of the plane, but among that wreckage forensic scientists were drawn to clothing stained with Semtex residue. One item bore the label Malta Trading Company. When German investigators checked through computer records, they discovered that baggage could have been transferred at Frankfurt on to flight 103A (the feeder for flight 103) from an incoming Air Malta plane. The search moved to the Mediterranean island. When they traced the manufacturer of the piece of clothing, investigators discovered that one of its outlets was Tony Gauci's tiny Mary's House store in the port of Sliema. Remarkably, Mr Gauci remembered selling the clothing to an Arabic man a few weeks before Christmas 1988. The man stuck in Mr Gauci's mind because he appeared to buy the clothing indiscriminately and paid little attention to either sizing or price. Mr Gauci had many dealings with customers from the Arab world and he could offer one further piece of information: the man's accent appeared to be Libyan. Airline receipts would later show that Megrahi was in Malta on December 7. Breakthrough Mr Gauci's evidence was a crucial factor in the case, the judges said. \"From his evidence it could be inferred that the first accused (Megrahi) was the person who bought the clothing which surrounded the explosive device.\" The next breakthrough was again the product of forensic detection. Among the rubble, the air accident investigation branch discovered another piece of circuit board. Detailed analysis showed it formed part of the timer used in the bomb. In time, detectives would discover it was an MST-13 timer manufactured by the Swiss firm MeBo - and testimony from the owner of this company, Edwin Bollier, gave the court a glimpse of the shadowy world of Megrahi's links to the international arms trade. At this point of the investigation, however, the trail began to go cold. It was not until 1991, in a US warship off the coast of Malta, that it would suddenly heat up again. In the summer of 1988, a Libyan named Abdul Majid Giaka presented himself at the American embassy in Malta claiming to be a disaffected member of the Libyan intelligence services, the JSO or joint security organisation. The CIA was immediately called and Giaka was recruited as a double agent. In exchange for payment of at least $1000 a month, Giaka - who worked alongside Megrahi and Fhimah at Malta's Luqa airport - gave information to the Americans. The information, however, was often not convincing. Under cross-examination at the trial, it became clear that Giaka had exaggerated his status within the JSO and had lied about his relationships with senior members of the service. The judges made it clear in their ruling that they did not find him to be a wholly reliable witness. The CIA were also uncertain of Giaka's worth: in cables released to the court the first time such sensitive material had been produced in a foreign court it be came apparent that the CIA had threatened to drop Giaka unless he came up with better intelligence. In the summer of 1991 the patience of Giaka's handlers finally snapped: they threatened to ditch him unless he agreed to a complete debriefing from US marshals. Giaka, by now desperate, agreed. The Libyan was taken to a US warship off the coast of Malta and it was there that he came up with his most damning evidence against Megrahi. Giaka told US officials that in 1986 he had been asked by the JSO to prepare a report on the possibility of planting a bomb on a British plane leaving Luqa. False passport The request was a response to Margaret Thatcher's decision to allow American bombers to use British airbases to launch a bombing raid on Tripoli and Benghazi. When Giaka told Megrahi - who was also a senior member of the JSO - about the report he replied: \"Don't rush things.\" But there was more damning evidence to come. On the day before the Lockerbie bombing, Giaka told investigators, he had watched Megrahi fly to Malta from Tripoli. He was travelling under a false passport in the name of Abdusamad. It was a pseudonym he used regularly on the trips he made to Malta on JSO business. When he arrived in Malta, Megrahi carried a brown Samsonite suitcase which had been stored in the cockpit of the plane. He took this suitcase unchecked through customs. He stayed only one night in Malta. Shortly after the Air Malta KM 180 plane carrying the Lockerbie bomb on its fateful journey left on the 21st, Megrahi boarded a Libyan Arab Airlines plane back to Tripoli. \"It is possible to infer that this visit under a false name the night before the explosive device was planted at Luqa, followed by his departure for Tripoli the following morning at or about the time the device must have been planted, was a visit connected with the planting of the device,\" said the judges.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The prosecution's route from Al-Amin Khalifah Fhimah to the Lockerbie bomb was fatally flawed. His alleged involvement hinged on the testimony of double agent Abdul Majid Giaka, and an entry in his diary.</p> <p>Mr Fhimah's name came into the frame late in 1988. He worked with Mr Giaka at Libyan Arab Airlines in Malta. By this time, Mr Giaka was also working as a double agent, betraying his masters at the JSO, Libya's intelligence organisation, to the CIA.</p> <p>Evidence was given that early on in their relationship Mr Giaka's handlers had threatened to ditch him unless he came up with better quality information. Late in 1988 Mr Giaka claimed that in the summer of 1986, when the pair shared an office, Mr Fhimah had shown him a quantity of orange-coloured explosive. This was an allegation that could not be checked. It also did little to advance the crown's case.</p> <p>Mr Giaka claimed the explosive was TNT; Flight 103 was destroyed by Semtex. The crown claimed Mr Giaka's evidence showed Mr Fhimah had ready access to explosives. The trouble was, even assuming his evidence was accepted, it was the wrong sort of explosive.</p> <p>Mr Giaka's testimony was, at times, doubtful and he had made fanciful claims to interrogators - not least that Colonel Gadafy was a freemason. Crucially, the crown had factual evidence to back up Mr Giaka's testimony against Megrahi; with Mr Fhimah, this was notable by its absence.</p> <p>More crucial evidence was Mr Fhimah's diary. In an entry dated six days before the Lockerbie bombing, he reminds himself to get Air Malta tags for Megrahi. The bomb which blew up Flight 103 was planted on an Air Malta plane from Luqa, before being transferred to the Pan Am jumbo at Frankfurt.</p> <p>Here the crown asked the judges to infer that this proved Mr Fhimah had helped Megrahi get the bomb on board. But, as the judges made clear in their written judgment, even if Mr Fhimah had helped Megrahi, there was no evidence that he had done so wittingly.</p> <p>In an attempt to prove that Mr Fhimah knew of the plot to blow up the aircraft, the crown revealed that although, at the time of the bombing, Mr Fhimah was no longer working for LAA, he had kept his security pass. This would have allowed him to get airside.</p> <p>Mr Fhimah made no secret of keeping the pass: he used it for identification when he hired a car.</p> <p>Not only that, there was no evidence he had gone airside. After this, Mr Fhimah's connection relied again on the testimony of Mr Giaka. He had claimed he had watched Mr Fhimah accompany Megrahi as he carried the suitcase which housed the bomb through Luqa airport.</p> <p>Mr Giaka also gave evidence that Mr Fhimah had often been in Megrahi's company in the 24 hours he was in Malta. Yet the two men were friends and colleagues at LAA - and the crown withdrew the accusation that Mr Fhimah was a member of the JSO.</p> <p>In the end, Mr Fhimah may have played a part in realising Megrahi's task of getting the bomb on board Flight 103.

      "bodyText": "The prosecution's route from Al-Amin Khalifah Fhimah to the Lockerbie bomb was fatally flawed. His alleged involvement hinged on the testimony of double agent Abdul Majid Giaka, and an entry in his diary. Mr Fhimah's name came into the frame late in 1988. He worked with Mr Giaka at Libyan Arab Airlines in Malta. By this time, Mr Giaka was also working as a double agent, betraying his masters at the JSO, Libya's intelligence organisation, to the CIA. Evidence was given that early on in their relationship Mr Giaka's handlers had threatened to ditch him unless he came up with better quality information. Late in 1988 Mr Giaka claimed that in the summer of 1986, when the pair shared an office, Mr Fhimah had shown him a quantity of orange-coloured explosive. This was an allegation that could not be checked. It also did little to advance the crown's case. Mr Giaka claimed the explosive was TNT; Flight 103 was destroyed by Semtex. The crown claimed Mr Giaka's evidence showed Mr Fhimah had ready access to explosives. The trouble was, even assuming his evidence was accepted, it was the wrong sort of explosive. Mr Giaka's testimony was, at times, doubtful and he had made fanciful claims to interrogators - not least that Colonel Gadafy was a freemason. Crucially, the crown had factual evidence to back up Mr Giaka's testimony against Megrahi; with Mr Fhimah, this was notable by its absence. More crucial evidence was Mr Fhimah's diary. In an entry dated six days before the Lockerbie bombing, he reminds himself to get Air Malta tags for Megrahi. The bomb which blew up Flight 103 was planted on an Air Malta plane from Luqa, before being transferred to the Pan Am jumbo at Frankfurt. Here the crown asked the judges to infer that this proved Mr Fhimah had helped Megrahi get the bomb on board. But, as the judges made clear in their written judgment, even if Mr Fhimah had helped Megrahi, there was no evidence that he had done so wittingly. In an attempt to prove that Mr Fhimah knew of the plot to blow up the aircraft, the crown revealed that although, at the time of the bombing, Mr Fhimah was no longer working for LAA, he had kept his security pass. This would have allowed him to get airside. Mr Fhimah made no secret of keeping the pass: he used it for identification when he hired a car. Not only that, there was no evidence he had gone airside. After this, Mr Fhimah's connection relied again on the testimony of Mr Giaka. He had claimed he had watched Mr Fhimah accompany Megrahi as he carried the suitcase which housed the bomb through Luqa airport. Mr Giaka also gave evidence that Mr Fhimah had often been in Megrahi's company in the 24 hours he was in Malta. Yet the two men were friends and colleagues at LAA - and the crown withdrew the accusation that Mr Fhimah was a member of the JSO. In the end, Mr Fhimah may have played a part in realising Megrahi's task of getting the bomb on board Flight 103. But there was no evidence to say he did so knowingly - to suggest that he did was an inference too far.

At a press conference this afternoon, UK Families Flight 103 will step up their campaign for a public inquiry into the atrocity. They believe serious questions remain unanswered. Successive British govern ments have denied the families a public inquiry for fear that it would prejudice a criminal trial, but now the trial is over the families will campaign for a full investigation. \"For the past 12 years governments have refused to talk to us about a public inquiry,\" said Jim Swire, whose daughter Flora died in the bombing. \"But in a meeting I had with Tony Blair he seemed broadly supportive of the idea. We intend to hold him to that.\" The families have also met the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, and it is understood that he has not ruled out their calls. In the US a civil case for damages from the Libyan government is pending. Only the American relatives are involved in this, but the British relatives may join their action. It is through the civil case that the relatives will have the best chance of holding Megrahi's masters to account. Bob Monetti of New Jersey, who lost his son Richard in the crash, said Megrahi's conviction would help the action. \"I'll tell you this, in a US civil court it'll be drop-dead easy to convict Libya, not just one guy,\" he said. To the anger of relatives, the Lockerbie trial was never about assessing Libya's role in terrorism. Colonel Muammar Gadafy was not on trial; only Megrahi and Mr Fhimah were. Although the relatives say compensation is a side issue, the civil action would give them a real chance of obtaining substantial compensation from the Libyan government. \"With Megrahi being found guilty, that is state-sponsored terrorism,\" said the American relatives' spokesman, Bert Ammerman. \"That leads to the doorstep of Gadafy.\" Britain urged Libya to admit that it had orchestrated the bombing. \"We expect the Libyan authorities to take full responsibility for the actions of their official,\" said a spokesman for Mr Blair. A public inquiry may prove embarrassing to Lady Thatcher and Britain's secret services. In the Commons in 1989, the Tory transport minister, Paul Channon, said warnings of a bombing had been dismissed because they lacked credibility.

      "body": "<p> Sending electronic files to other people is becoming a frustrating problem for PC users, as the documents they work with are growing larger and larger. Creating a stunning but substantial PowerPoint presentation on your home PC is a bit like building a boat in your basement - how do you ever get it out? </p> <p>PC files these days are frequently many megabytes. Tempted by fast processors and humungous hard drives, it is all too easy for users to end up with a file of a quite unreasonable size, whether it be a music clip, corporate presentation or video of the kids. Far exceeding the storage capabilities of the standard diskette, these files cannot simply be copied onto a disk and popped into the post. Writing CD-roms is a neat way round the problem if you have the necessary equipment, but still not particularly handy if you want to send 10 copies to people all over the world in a hurry. </p> <p>Email is the most obvious and also the easiest way to pass a useful file to someone else. Unfortunately, it is fraught with problems when it comes to large files. Sometimes you cannot send messages of many megabytes in size even if you wish to, due to restrictions imposed by the internet service providers themselves. And the worst crime you can commit is to fill up someone's mailbox so they are prevented from receiving any more email. Your corre spondent may not take kindly to discover vital business communications have been disrupted by an animated birthday card. </p> <p>You may have come across the expert opinion that you should use something known as FTP (File Transfer Protocol). A protocol used to copy files to and from storage repositories, FTP is fine for large organisations that have an FTP server, but hardly appropriate for dial-up home users who will not have FTP access to a disk drive, except perhaps their own web site. Fortunately, there are plenty of much more easily accessible solutions instead. </p> <p>If you do have your own website and have not used up your storage allowance, you can consider placing your large files there. Then, send the intended recipients the web address in an email, which they click on to view or download the file. For example, if your website is <a href=\"http://www.deniseworme.com,\">www.deniseworme.com,</a> and you upload a large file called homemovie.mpg to it, mail out the address <a href=\"http://www.deniseworme.com/homemovie.mpg\">www.deniseworme.com/homemovie.mpg</a> - in theory, your file is then publicly accessible, but it is unlikely that anyone will find it without already knowing the filename. Nevertheless, do not use this method if security is important. </p> <p>Some mailing programs, like Microsoft Outlook, will split a file into small parts automatically. But while this overcomes any limit on individual messages, it does not help with any of the other challenges, and makes matters more complicated for both the sender and the recipient. It will only work with some mailing programs - it certainly will not be of any use when sending to web-based email services such as Hotmail - and recombining the messages is a contest most users will not relish. </p> <p>But now, widely available on the internet and free of charge, is a technique that is within the capabilities of virtually any internet user, and is scarcely more complicated than using a Hotmail account. Several companies provide what are known as free internet drives - it is like having your own disk drive storage out in cyberspace. With names like FreeDrive and WhaleMail, they are specifically designed to be used by the general internet user, and not experts. Naturally, even systems like these have limits - perhaps a time limit as well as a filesize limit - but not many people will need more than the generous 75MB that WhaleMail offers. </p> <p>Some initial effort is needed before you can use these services, because you do have to register. Thereafter, it is a straightforward matter to copy files into your internet drive and send them to other users. Taking Xdrive ( <a href=\"http://www.xdrive.com\">www.xdrive.com</a> ) as an example, once you have registered and logged in you just click on Upload to upload a file. You can copy up to five files at once. Selecting the files is just a matter of clicking the Browse button - just like adding attachments to a Hotmail message. </p> <p>Of course, uploading a large file could take a considerable period of time. Xdrive shows you a progress bar, which is a significant improvement on some of its competitors. It also allows you to create folders, in case you have so many files you need help keeping them organised. Access to all these sites is just via your standard web browser, although Xdrive does also provide a software download that installs to give you an \"X: drive\" in Windows Explorer. This makes copying files, and even folders, a doddle - just drag and drop. </p> <p>Sending a file to someone else is just a matter of selecting it and clicking on the Share button. Enter up to five email addresses, and they each receive a message with a URL to collect the file from. Files are only made available for a limited period of time - seven days with Xdrive, 14 days with WhaleMail and other services. Watch you do not rename, move or delete your file within that period, or they will not be able to collect it. Unfortunately, Xdrive does not inform you when the file has been collected, so you have to rely on the receiver letting you know. </p> <p>In theory, Xdrive allows people to view a file before they commit to downloading what could be a lengthy and potentially expensive mistake, but I could not make this work. And when downloading, a rather confusing extra dialog box appears in which you have to select \"Open this file from its current location\", before you get the dialog for the file itself. </p> <p>Another technique for sending large files is to use on-line chat and messenger services, such as the popular Yahoo! Messenger, MSN Messenger, AOL Instant Messenger and IRC. These all allow users to transfer files directly via the internet, and are also free. The drawback is that both parties have to be online at the same time, although if you configure the software correctly you do not have to be around when a file comes in - the action can take place overnight, or while you are out. </p> <p>If you do want your email software to split large files for you, here is how to do it with Outlook. Both parties will need Outlook 98 or later, although the person receiving the mail does not need to do anything: Outlook will even combine the individual messages automatically. Select Accounts on the Tools menu, and then click the Mail tab. Select the properties for the account you want to change, and on the Advanced tab check the box next to \"Break apart messages larger than_\" and specify a suitable size. </p> <p>Unfortunately, the process of splitting the message can take Outlook a considerable period of time. But beware: even if you do not split it up, just emailing a single large attachment can keep Outlook busy for a considerable period - so long, in fact, that you would be forgiven for thinking it had given up the ghost. </p> <p><strong> Sending large files</strong><br> <strong> Progress.tif</strong> Uploads may be slow, so Xdrive's progress indicator helps keeps track </p> <p><strong> Xdrive Folders.tif</strong> Xdrive provides folders to help you organise your on-line files </p> <p><strong> Download.tif</strong> Your recipient has the option of viewing the file before choosing to download it </p> <p><strong> Email.tif</strong> Your recipient gets an email to let them know the file is waiting for them </p> <p><strong> Free internet large hard drive storage</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.idrive.com \">www.idrive.com</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.xdrive.com  \">www.xdrive.com</a> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.whalemail.com  \">www.whalemail.com</a> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.driveway.com  \">www.driveway.com</a> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.freedrive.com\">www.freedrive.com</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.idrive.com \">www.idrive.com</a> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.xdrive.com  \">www.xdrive.com</a> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.whalemail.com  \">www.whalemail.com</a> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.driveway.com \">www.driveway.com</a></p> <p><strong> Messenger and chat software</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.mirc.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.mirc.com</a> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.aol.com/aim\" target=\"_new\">www.aol.com/aim</a> </p> <p><a href=\"http://messenger.yahoo.com\" target=\"_new\">Messenger.yahoo.com</a> </p> <p><a href=\"http://messenger.msn.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">Messenger.msn.co.uk</a> </p>",

One brother jokes the premier was \"a man who needs no introduction\" while another thinks he does. \"Hello Lord Rama, you look like Lord Rama,\" he says. Lord Rama is a Hindu god and Mr Blair makes no claim to be a diety, rather laughing nervously, and when he is introduced to \"the younger brother\" PP says: \"Yes, we've met before, didn't we?\"</p> <p>The DVD is expensively made, featuring a specially recorded message from pop star Michael Jackson lauding SP and GP. Mr Blair's entry on the stage triggers applause, confetti, fireworks and classical music. SP Hinduja says: \"May I request all of you to join us in voicing our support for the PM's initiatives for the next millennium.\"</p> <p>After repeating a traditional Hindi greeting, Mr Blair outlines his New Labour vision for the 21st century, before he thanks his hosts: \"This is a proud moment for me as a British prime minister. And so my friends, thank you for coming, thank you the Hindujas for having organised this evening ...\"</p> <p>In a more comic moment the master of ceremonies, Sir David Frost, then introduces Mr Vaz who does not miss an opportunity to ingratiate himself with his close friends, Britain's richest Asian family.</p> <p>\"Can I in particular mention Vinoo, the eldest daughter of the next generation of Hindujas, who has worked tirelessly over the last few months to make this evening possible. Thank you, Vinoo, for what you have done.\" As the camera pans to the audience where she is sitting, Vinoo is seen talking on a mobile phone rather than listening to Mr Vaz.<br><br></p> <p><b>Cartoon</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/graphic/0,7367,430876,00.html\">30.01.2001: Steve Bell on Labour's reaction to Mandelson's resignation</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/graphic/0,7367,428461,00.html\">Steve Bell on life without Peter Mandelson</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430740,00.html\">30.01.2001: It was Alastair Campbell who led an iniquitous panic</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430828,00.html\">30.01.2001: MI6 drawn into Hinduja passport row</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430669,00.html\">30.01.2001: A Whitehall farce </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/story/0,7369,430305,00.html\">29.01.2001: Cabinet cuts off Mandelson</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430254,00.html\">29.01.2001, analysis: How Mandelson and Campbell came to blows</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430250,00.html\">29.01.2001, analysis: 'I think Peter has been slightly detached'</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430253,00.html\">29.01.2001: Brother deals new blow to Vaz</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430189,00.html\">29.01.2001, leader: Spinning out of control</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430167,00.html\">29.01.2001, Roy Hattersley: Why the passing of Peter isn't very important</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,429979,00.html\">28.01.2001, Andrew Rawnsley: Why he really had to go</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427850,00.html\">25.01.2001: A glittering career in ruins</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/story/0,7369,427840,00.html\">25.01.2001, Benjamin Wegg-Prosser: I'm Mandy, fire me</a></p> <p><b>Audio</b><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0124mandelson.ra\">24.01.2001: Peter Mandelson's resignation statement</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/gall/0,8542,427511,00.html\">Peter Mandelson: a life in pictures</a></p> <p><b>The 1998 home loan row</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427485,00.html\">Text of resignation letter</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427469,00.html\">24.12.1998: Mandelson, the minister and the \u00a3373,000 loan</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427471,00.html\">24.12.1998: Mandelson: undone by a story that could not be done</a></p> <p><b>Andrew Rawnsley: inside New Labour</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,369240,00.html\">Mandelson resigns over his home loan</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,369238,00.html\">Rivals in the Labour party</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,366690,00.html\">How Mandy replaced Mo</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br><a href=\"http://talk.guardianunlimited.co.uk/WebX?13@@.ee7e6ee\">Have your say on the Mandelson affair</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.sunday-times.co.uk/news/pages/sti/2001/01/28/stifocnws02001.html\" target=\"_new\">Peter Mandelson: Why I had to go - Sunday Times, 28.01.2001</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427516,00.html\">24.01.2001: Full text of Mandelson's resignation statement</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hindujagroup.com/history.htm\" target=\"_new\">Hinduja group history</a><br><a href=\"http://www.number10.gov.uk/default.asp?PageId=3284\" target=\"_new\">Downing Street press briefing</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.hartlepoolmail.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Hartlepool Mail</a></p>",

But the lavishly-produced 15-minute film made by the Hindujas and obtained by the Guardian - sent out on a DVD by Srichand Hinduja with his Christmas cards - suggests a familiarity beyond that required by a politician at formal occasions. Smiling Tony and Cherie Blair are shown being greeted by the four brothers - Srichand (SP), Gopichand (GP), Prakash (PP) and Ashok (AP) -- at Alexandra Palace during the November 1999 Diwali celebrations hosted by the Hindujas. One brother jokes the premier was \"a man who needs no introduction\" while another thinks he does. \"Hello Lord Rama, you look like Lord Rama,\" he says. Lord Rama is a Hindu god and Mr Blair makes no claim to be a diety, rather laughing nervously, and when he is introduced to \"the younger brother\" PP says: \"Yes, we've met before, didn't we?\" The DVD is expensively made, featuring a specially recorded message from pop star Michael Jackson lauding SP and GP. Mr Blair's entry on the stage triggers applause, confetti, fireworks and classical music. SP Hinduja says: \"May I request all of you to join us in voicing our support for the PM's initiatives for the next millennium.\" After repeating a traditional Hindi greeting, Mr Blair outlines his New Labour vision for the 21st century, before he thanks his hosts: \"This is a proud moment for me as a British prime minister. And so my friends, thank you for coming, thank you the Hindujas for having organised this evening ...\" In a more comic moment the master of ceremonies, Sir David Frost, then introduces Mr Vaz who does not miss an opportunity to ingratiate himself with his close friends, Britain's richest Asian family. \"Can I in particular mention Vinoo, the eldest daughter of the next generation of Hindujas, who has worked tirelessly over the last few months to make this evening possible. Thank you, Vinoo, for what you have done.\" As the camera pans to the audience where she is sitting, Vinoo is seen talking on a mobile phone rather than listening to Mr Vaz.

The speed of the verdicts' arrival and the judges' decision to stretch their judicial brief specifically to rule out any wider involvement in the bombing other than that of Libya will further inflame legions of conspiratorial critics.</p> <p>The Lockerbie affair has, after all, been a triumph of realpolitik over all the evidence and questions of motive. Suspicion must still focus on Iran, Syria and the dissident Palestinian armed-action squad, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (General Command) and the likelihood that Lockerbie was a revenge for the downing in July 1988, of an Iranian airbus by the USS Vincennes (a guided missile-destroyer) in the Gulf of Hormuz.</p> <p>This cynicism is triggered by the immunity seemingly granted by western governments to these suspects for reasons of the greater good. There are excellent reasons why American and British politicians, policemen and diplomats would have rather seen isolated, feeble and irritating Libya in the frame than the Palestinian dissidents, Iranians and Syrians, at whom the accusing fingers first and so convincingly pointed.</p> <p>When the bombing of Lockerbie happened in December 1988, the western shaping of the Middle East for the 1990s and even 2000s was already beginning.</p> <p>The Iran-Iraq war had ended, with Iran diminished, if not defeated.

      "bodyText": "The Lockerbie verdicts will not convince the majority of Arabs, the community of Middle East watchers and most of the victims' families that justice has been done, or that anyone but a footsoldier, as one of the victims' representatives described Abdelbaset Al Megrahi, has been made a scapegoat. The speed of the verdicts' arrival and the judges' decision to stretch their judicial brief specifically to rule out any wider involvement in the bombing other than that of Libya will further inflame legions of conspiratorial critics. The Lockerbie affair has, after all, been a triumph of realpolitik over all the evidence and questions of motive. Suspicion must still focus on Iran, Syria and the dissident Palestinian armed-action squad, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (General Command) and the likelihood that Lockerbie was a revenge for the downing in July 1988, of an Iranian airbus by the USS Vincennes (a guided missile-destroyer) in the Gulf of Hormuz. This cynicism is triggered by the immunity seemingly granted by western governments to these suspects for reasons of the greater good. There are excellent reasons why American and British politicians, policemen and diplomats would have rather seen isolated, feeble and irritating Libya in the frame than the Palestinian dissidents, Iranians and Syrians, at whom the accusing fingers first and so convincingly pointed. When the bombing of Lockerbie happened in December 1988, the western shaping of the Middle East for the 1990s and even 2000s was already beginning. The Iran-Iraq war had ended, with Iran diminished, if not defeated. Iran and the US, and the west in general, were extending tentative feelers towards one another, nearly 10 years after the Iranian revolution, in the shape of an American unfreezing of many Iranian financial assets and Iranian compensation for American individuals and Amoco's damaged oil interests. Both Britain and the US, after the death of Ayatollah Khomeini in 1989, saw a practical and canny man they could deal with in the new president, Hashemi Rafsanjani.

The chancellor's residence was given over yesterday to a breakfast seminar on moral purpose in government. The timing, though accidental, was perfect. Yet the signals were conflicting.</p> <p>On the one hand, here was high seriousness sweeping aside the sense of squalor, which reached a new high this very morning, when Labour registered more bleakly on the sleaze-scale, according to opinion polls, than the Major government. The meeting was very Scottish. The invitation said it would be \"timeous\", a word southerners need to look up (\"timely\") but which turned out to be truer than anyone foretold when the summons went out weeks ago.</p> <p>The seminar could also be said to represent what might have been. The organisers were the Smith Institute, set up to keep alive the work and thought of John Smith, high-minded and presbyterian, whose untimeous death put Tony Blair where he is today. Smith was a reluctant convert to spin, and sacked Mandelson from his job as Labour's media controller. Gordon Brown himself presided here, and warmly introduced the speakers. He couldn't have wished for a better milieu in which to mark a return to politics as he used to know it: earnest, visionary, unflinchingly solemn.</p> <p>On the other hand, it didn't entirely fit. The main speaker proposed a social analysis seemingly so far from Brown's or Smith's as to be worthy of the epithet Mandelsonian. James Q Wilson, a well-known conservative American professor, made a speech that had nothing to do with socialism, which is supposed to be the creed saved for Britain by Mandelson's departure. As the most senior Labour politician to regularly use this old term, Mr Brown seemed undismayed by the Wilson analysis which directly challenges it.</p> <p>The professor's message is that modern social ills can be cured only by a revival of individual morality. He's a prophet of the innate moral intuition of humanity, a faculty which, he argues, the state has done much to diminish if not destroy. He has examined the moral decline of advanced societies, and makes a case for the intervention of voluntary agencies to revive the family and reverse the trend. That's a shorthand account of some large work. Wilson's biggest recent triumph is the arrival of a former pupil at the head of George Bush's new programme of faith-based initiatives to restore \"values\" to American society.</p> <p>This is not a nonsensical proposition. There's a dangerous chasm, in both halves of Anglo-American society rather more than in some continental countries, between the riches of economic advance and the poverty of social order. Crime levels, teenage pregnancy rates, alienated youth, evidences of social disaffection, all are troubling to any sentient observer, and have proved pretty immune to conventional political responses. If faith groups had a significant presence in British society, they might have a role to play. Such an approach fits the ideologically cross-dressed politics that Tony Blair half-espouses and Peter Mandelson represented.</p> <p>It's a long way, though, from Gordon Brown's. Or so one thought. It argues for subcontracting from the state some of the problems he now feels freer than before to define as public problems with public solutions. The Mandelson v Brown contest always had a political as well as tactical content. It may have been partly about issues of personal ascendancy. But it also bit deeply into the strategic question of how New Labour should define itself, with Mandelson, from his Belfast outpost, still trying to insist that this was no longer a socialist party.</p> <p>Anyone who heard Brown at the Fabian Society conference last weekend thought they saw how far he has rowed back from that position, which as founders of New Labour all these characters once shared. His speech was a proclamation for the benign state, and a promise that state economic power, handled by Labour true believers, would eliminate child poverty, advance universal education, and rectify the defects of an unequal society. It was an old-fashioned tub-thump, of Bevanite passion, for the duty of the enabling state to deliver the promised land.</p> <p>The waters are closing over Mandelson now. The original message-man finds every Labour politician on message to write him out of the script. It's uncanny to converse with half a dozen random figures from the party, MPs and advisers alike, and see how completely the former minister is already relegated to irrelevance. Some people might think a torrid time awaits the government, as its conduct of the Hinduja passport affair comes under intimate scrutiny via the Hammond inquiry. An objective observer could still regard the verdict on Mandelson's conduct as not proven, and the outcome for his future life as remaining to be justified. I have yet to meet a single Labour politician who gives such fastidiousness the slightest credence.</p> <p>This is partly because they disliked the former minister, and saw his methods as creating endless trouble. They are glad to see the back of someone so thoroughly divisive. The more charitable say he should never have become an MP at all, but remained a backroom fixer, perhaps deploying his organisational talents as general secretary of the party. Harsher judges, including one-time close allies, venomously blackguard every aspect of his character, as well as muttering against Blair's judgment for letting him get anywhere near the top - twice.</p> <p>But another attack is against the content of the politics he advanced, as the black prince of anti-socialism. On this account (Clare Short is a representative voice) he betrayed the party. Good riddance to this running dog of the rich and famous, distracting Labour from its progressive destiny. Long live the true faith.</p> <p>Yet that's not quite how things sounded in 11 Downing Street yesterday, where Professor Wilson got a quite admiring audience for his treatise on the politics of personal salvation. Key to his thesis is the proposition that the state has failed, and is never likely to succeed. It's a plausible if contentious line, not original but worth discussing. What it is, indisputably, is conservative: the acme of an individualism which is to be mediated, if at all, by non-state bodies. It's what William Hague is feeling for, with his wishful faith-based imitations of Dubya Bush.</p> <p>The fact that Gordon Brown hosted the seminar doesn't mean he has to agree with the main speaker. Intellectual curiosity shouldn't be stigmatised, even in a chancellor. But he spoke reverentially of Wilson as a towering authority, whose books he had read with profit. Wilson's theories offer an escape-hatch for politicians who have been fought to a standstill by problems of human behaviour they've been unable to master. An irony begins to inch its way over the horizon. The Rasputin of Labour's rightist phase has been disposed of. But the Lenin of its modernised socialism is getting ready to have second thoughts.

      "body": "<p>Vocalis, the speech recognition firm that has seen its share price slump by 90% over the past year, yesterday left investors baffled when it issued a profits warning just hours after releasing an upbeat statement about a new business division. </p> <p>Shares in the group, which changed hands at \u00a310.80p last year, fell a further 32% to 70p last night after the optimistic statement was \"retracted\" and replaced by a downbeat trading update signalling that a delay to the signing of new business contracts could hit profits. </p> <p>The first announcement, about the creation of a division called The Talking Network and carrying enthusiastic quotes from both <a href=\"http://www.vocalisinc.com/\">Vocalis'</a> chief executive and chief operating officer, prompted a 6.5p rise in the firm's shares. </p> <p>The company later retracted it, however, because \"it was not authorised by the board\", prompting a slump in the share price which the stock exchange might require Vocalis to explain. </p> <p>A spokesman for the stock exchange declined to say whether it had been in contact with the company but added: \"As a matter of policy we investigate all unusual share price movements.\" </p> <p>A spokesman for Vocalis said he was unable to explain the sequence of events, while chief executive Charles Halle and the company's stockbroker, Credit Lyonnais, failed to return telephone calls. </p> <p>Vocalis blamed the possible profits shortfall on its failure to sign contracts worth around \u00a34m and said that unless they were sealed soon it is likely to record a loss for the year to March 31, 2001. </p> <p>Of the Talking Network it said: \"The board are reviewing a number of strategic options to maximise The Talking Network's potential.\" The earlier statement said it was to become \"a separate business entity\". </p> <p>Investors have endured a torrid time over the past year as the price of the shares has slumped from its former high. In August, Vocalis raised \u00a35m by placing 2.2m shares at 230p each. Five months on, the stock is worth less than a third of the price it was sold at. </p> <p>However, Vocalis yesterday reiterated its confidence in the \"marketability of the group's core speech-recognition technology\". </p> <p>Technology experts have for some time had high hopes for speech recognition software, which enables people to telephone call centres, ask a machine a question, such as requesting the price of a share or asking about the weather forecast for a particular area, and hear the response without at any time speaking to a person. </p> <p>Mobile devices which allow users to search the internet by asking them questions are seen as the big growth area for firms such as Vocalis but so far they have failed to take off. </p> <p>Analysts believe that it is still a product waiting for a market.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Vocalis, the speech recognition firm that has seen its share price slump by 90% over the past year, yesterday left investors baffled when it issued a profits warning just hours after releasing an upbeat statement about a new business division. Shares in the group, which changed hands at \u00a310.80p last year, fell a further 32% to 70p last night after the optimistic statement was \"retracted\" and replaced by a downbeat trading update signalling that a delay to the signing of new business contracts could hit profits. The first announcement, about the creation of a division called The Talking Network and carrying enthusiastic quotes from both Vocalis' chief executive and chief operating officer, prompted a 6.5p rise in the firm's shares. The company later retracted it, however, because \"it was not authorised by the board\", prompting a slump in the share price which the stock exchange might require Vocalis to explain. A spokesman for the stock exchange declined to say whether it had been in contact with the company but added: \"As a matter of policy we investigate all unusual share price movements.\" A spokesman for Vocalis said he was unable to explain the sequence of events, while chief executive Charles Halle and the company's stockbroker, Credit Lyonnais, failed to return telephone calls. Vocalis blamed the possible profits shortfall on its failure to sign contracts worth around \u00a34m and said that unless they were sealed soon it is likely to record a loss for the year to March 31, 2001. Of the Talking Network it said: \"The board are reviewing a number of strategic options to maximise The Talking Network's potential.\" The earlier statement said it was to become \"a separate business entity\". Investors have endured a torrid time over the past year as the price of the shares has slumped from its former high. In August, Vocalis raised \u00a35m by placing 2.2m shares at 230p each. Five months on, the stock is worth less than a third of the price it was sold at. However, Vocalis yesterday reiterated its confidence in the \"marketability of the group's core speech-recognition technology\". Technology experts have for some time had high hopes for speech recognition software, which enables people to telephone call centres, ask a machine a question, such as requesting the price of a share or asking about the weather forecast for a particular area, and hear the response without at any time speaking to a person. Mobile devices which allow users to search the internet by asking them questions are seen as the big growth area for firms such as Vocalis but so far they have failed to take off. Analysts believe that it is still a product waiting for a market.",

Barely 20 million years later, the dinosaurs had gone and, after a brief flirtation with gigantic carnivorous birds, the world teemed with placental mammals of every kind. The ancestors of elephants were unpacking their trunks just as the first whales were experimenting with paddling (they looked more like large dogs and had legs). This rapid diversification of placental mammals was fun while it lasted, but there has been a price to pay: 85 million years later, scientists are having a hard time working out what happened first. </p> <p>The problem is one of genealogy, of working out the branching order in the placental family tree. We think we know a rabbit from a rhinoceros, but familiarity should not breed contempt. Understanding the history of the placental mammals has produced debates as acrimonious as any in science, as evolutionary trees created from careful comparison of bones and teeth have been challenged by those produced from data gathered from proteins and DNA sequences. </p> <p>As the trickle of genomic data swiftly becomes a flood, the need for a robust solution to the history of the mammals becomes ever more urgent. The way in which animals are related provides a framework for testing ideas about evolution, development and even medicine. How? Here is one example: out of thousands of placental species, just two are the subject of large-scale genomic exploration - human beings and laboratory mice. If mice and men are found to be distant relatives, comparisons between mice and human genomes will be a fair measure of variation among placentals as a whole. If they are closer, we will be on safer ground comparing mouse gene function with that of humans, but conscious that much remains to be learned about placental genomic diversity. Placentals may seem familiar, but almost all species remain dark continents under the skin. </p> <p>Two reports in today's Nature promise a degree of resolution. One comes from Mark S. Springer of the University of California, Riverside and colleagues; the other is from Stephen O'Brien of the National Cancer Institute in Frederick, Maryland and colleagues. Although compiled independently, and using completely different sets of genes, both reports are remarkably congruent in their results: this alone will give embattled researchers some comfort that the major features of placental evolution can now be sketched out. According to O'Brien, the two research groups are pooling their data and refining the results still further. </p> <p>The results themselves are surprisingly clear. There are, basically, four great groups of placental mammals. One is the so-called Xenarthra - the bizarre anteaters, armadillos and sloths of South and Central America. This group should be no surprise - xenarthrans evolved in South America not long after the placentals first appeared, and have gone their distinctive way ever since. Scientists have long recognised them as distinct. The second major group is different. It comprises what seems to be a rag-bag of creatures that look nothing like one another - elephants, hyraxes, sea-cows, the aardvark, elephant-shrews and a few insectivores confined to Africa and Madagascar. </p> <p>Four years ago, Springer's group, using gene sequences, found strong evidence that these disparate creatures formed a group - a group for which no anatomical justification has ever been made. Even so, the genetic signs of this group have onlybecome stronger, supported in the current study by the shared presence in all these animals of a unique genetic deletion in BRCA1, a gene which, in humans, has been linked with breast and ovarian cancer. Springer and colleagues have called this group the Afrotheria, and suggest they share a distinct heritage going back to the dawn of placental mammals. Africa 85 million years ago was like Australia now - a haven for a distinct fauna, an endemic flavour of biodiversity. Since then, time and change have overwritten all signs of the Afrotherian heritage, except in the genes. </p> <p>The third group comprises a vast range of grazing animals - cows, horses and their relatives - together with animals as diverse as whales, bats, cats, dogs, a bizarre kind of scaly anteater called the pangolin and a few insectivores such as the hedgehog. </p> <p>The fourth is, for humans, the most interesting: it comprises the primates, the rodents and rabbits, the gliding colugo of south-east Asia, and the insectivore-like tree-shrews. Man and mice do, indeed, share the same branch in the placental family tree. </p> <p>Taken together, this new work reveals interesting features about mammalian evolution. For example, it is interesting that the most primitive members of all these groups are, broadly speaking, insectivores - all except the Xenarthra, which are in any case insect-eating specialists. This suggests that the earliest placental mam mals, of whatever group, probably looked and behaved like today's insectivores, such as shrews and hedgehogs. Modern insectivores, then, do not form a group of related creatures. Instead, they represent a grade of organisation through which all placental mammals evolved on their way to greater things. </p> <p>Another feature is convergence: in each of these groups, we can see how habits have shaped the forms of animals so they come to look the same, despite being related only distantly. Most groups have a dedicated anteater - the xenarthrans (in the eponymous anteater); the afrotheres (in the aardvark); and the group of grazers and allies (the pangolin.) Two groups (grazers and afrotheres) have produced wholly aquatic forms (whales and dugongs); two groups (grazers and primates) have taken to the air. Thanks to molecular genetic evidence, mammal evolution has become better understood - and much stranger and interesting than anybody imagined. </p> <p> \u0095 Henry Gee is a senior editor of Nature.</p>",

      "body": "<p>There is more to colour than meets the eye. We learn at school that there are three primary colours, and the rest of the rainbow can be made by mixing these. Red light plus green light gives yellow, blue plus green gives cyan and so on. This may be true for most of us, but it now seems that there is a small group of people for whom yellow is one colour and \"red plus green\" is quite different. These people are called tetrachromats, whose unusual combination of genes may give them an extra dimension of colour. </p> <p>Colour vision is provided by cone cells in the retina. Normally, there are three different types of cone, each sensitive to a different range of colour: red, green and blue. The way we perceive colour depends on the combination of the responses of the three different types, giving us three dimensions of colour. Colour television uses three colour guns, and colour printers need three inks to cater for the full range of our trichromatic colour perception. </p> <p>The genes for green and red pigment are both located on the X-chromosome. It sometimes happens that instead of having one of each, the X-chromosome has a green only, or two different greens. The red is lacking and the result is colour-deficiency. The individuals with these genes have only two dimensions of colour vision, blue and green. Others end up with red chromosomes and no green. These people are dichromatic, and the most obvious effect is that they distinguish fewer colours at one end of the spectrum. Blue and turquoise, lime and emerald green are all the same as far as they are concerned. </p> <p>There are also a few individuals who have no cone cells and are completely colour-blind. We all have rod cells, which provide vision in low lighting and are not sensitive to colour. This is why we see the twilight world in shades of grey. People with no cone cells see the world this way permanently. </p> <p>Women have two X-chromosomes, so if a colour is missing on one they have a spare. Men have only one X-chromosome and so are much more likely to be colour blind. Something like 8% of men have some abnormality in colour vision. </p> <p>Another possible effect of having two X-chromosomes is that a woman who is a carrier for colour-blindness might have one X-chromosome with red and green and one with green and a different green. Her son, who has only the two green pigments, is colour blind. But the woman herself may have cone cells for blue, red, green and the extra green. Instead of having the usual three dimensions of colour she might have four. She would be a tetrachromat. </p> <p>Drs Gabriele Jordan and John Mollon of the University of Cambridge have been trying for some years to confirm the existence of tetrachromats, with good theoretical reasons. Squirrel monkeys are generally dichromatic, but research carried out in 1986 showed that many females possess genes that make them trichromatic, giving them a wider range of colours than their companions. </p> <p>Dr Jordan has tested a range of volunteers including a group of women with colour-blind children. In one exercise the volunteers were asked to find a mixture of green and orange light that matched a particular shade of yellow-orange. For normal trichromats there should be a whole range of matches, but for a tetrachromat the added dimension means there would only be one combination that matched exactly. </p> <p>The experiment showed that the potential tetrachromats were much more finicky about declaring a match to be exact, and made different matches to others. \"I want to be able to add more orange to the mixture, not red,\" said one subject. \"It's the wrong kind of orange,\" said another, \"it looks rather pink when I add more red.\" This suggests they can make real colour distinctions between shades that look identical to the rest of us. Dr Jordan, now at the University of Newcastle, is starting further tests to show conclusively whether she has discovered true tetrachromats. Getting the right equipment can be a challenge: how do you know the apparatus is producing the right signal if it all looks the same to you? </p> <p>If tetrachromats exist, it would prove that the brain, which normally only handles three colour channels, is capable of handling input from a fourth channel. By extension, it might be possible one day using gene therapy to give colour-blind people their missing colour. The technology is decades away, but should eventually be possible. There is also an intriguing possibility - a more advanced form of gene therapy that would give women tetrachromatic colour vision. </p> <p>In the animal world, tetrachromats are not so extraordinary. Bees need to tell flowers apart and so have evolved as tetrachromats. They also see further into the ultraviolet than humans. Some butterflies go one better and are actually pentachromats with five different types of colour sensor. What a colourful world they must live in. </p> <p>An enhanced sense of colour is of limited use in the modern world because all colour reproduction is based on a three-colour system. To a tetrachromat, television and photographs never quite reproduce colours accurately. They would need a special television or computer monitor with four colour guns or a special colour printer. </p> <p>We should be careful about assuming that colour-blindness is a disability. It was not even recognised until the 18th century, probably because so little artificial colour existed. Colour-blind hunters are not at a disadvantage, in fact rather the opposite. They seem to be better at picking out prey against a confusing background than those with normal colour vision. The military have found that colour-blind soldiers can sometimes see through camouflage that fools everyone else, and new camouflage patterns have to be checked by people with both sorts of vision. </p> <p>Joseph O'Neil is an amateur astronomer whose colour blindness went undetected through his childhood. \"I always used to walk with my head pointed down to the ground . . . teachers and other concerned adults always assumed I suffered from low self-esteem or some other psychobabble condition, when it was the inability to walk in bright sunlight without experiencing pain in my eyes.\" O'Neil finds he has better night vision than his colleagues, clearly an asset when searching for faint astronomical objects. </p> <p>Some 16% of women are carriers for colour-blindness. It has been suggested that this kind of vision helps in search tasks (like finding berries), whereas colour-blind men may have evolved as superior hunters. Even if you can't see the same colours as other people, maybe you can still see things they can't.</p>",

Instead of having the usual three dimensions of colour she might have four. She would be a tetrachromat. Drs Gabriele Jordan and John Mollon of the University of Cambridge have been trying for some years to confirm the existence of tetrachromats, with good theoretical reasons. Squirrel monkeys are generally dichromatic, but research carried out in 1986 showed that many females possess genes that make them trichromatic, giving them a wider range of colours than their companions. Dr Jordan has tested a range of volunteers including a group of women with colour-blind children. In one exercise the volunteers were asked to find a mixture of green and orange light that matched a particular shade of yellow-orange. For normal trichromats there should be a whole range of matches, but for a tetrachromat the added dimension means there would only be one combination that matched exactly. The experiment showed that the potential tetrachromats were much more finicky about declaring a match to be exact, and made different matches to others. \"I want to be able to add more orange to the mixture, not red,\" said one subject. \"It's the wrong kind of orange,\" said another, \"it looks rather pink when I add more red.\" This suggests they can make real colour distinctions between shades that look identical to the rest of us. Dr Jordan, now at the University of Newcastle, is starting further tests to show conclusively whether she has discovered true tetrachromats. Getting the right equipment can be a challenge: how do you know the apparatus is producing the right signal if it all looks the same to you? If tetrachromats exist, it would prove that the brain, which normally only handles three colour channels, is capable of handling input from a fourth channel. By extension, it might be possible one day using gene therapy to give colour-blind people their missing colour. The technology is decades away, but should eventually be possible. There is also an intriguing possibility - a more advanced form of gene therapy that would give women tetrachromatic colour vision. In the animal world, tetrachromats are not so extraordinary. Bees need to tell flowers apart and so have evolved as tetrachromats. They also see further into the ultraviolet than humans. Some butterflies go one better and are actually pentachromats with five different types of colour sensor. What a colourful world they must live in. An enhanced sense of colour is of limited use in the modern world because all colour reproduction is based on a three-colour system. To a tetrachromat, television and photographs never quite reproduce colours accurately. They would need a special television or computer monitor with four colour guns or a special colour printer. We should be careful about assuming that colour-blindness is a disability. It was not even recognised until the 18th century, probably because so little artificial colour existed. Colour-blind hunters are not at a disadvantage, in fact rather the opposite. They seem to be better at picking out prey against a confusing background than those with normal colour vision. The military have found that colour-blind soldiers can sometimes see through camouflage that fools everyone else, and new camouflage patterns have to be checked by people with both sorts of vision. Joseph O'Neil is an amateur astronomer whose colour blindness went undetected through his childhood. \"I always used to walk with my head pointed down to the ground . . . teachers and other concerned adults always assumed I suffered from low self-esteem or some other psychobabble condition, when it was the inability to walk in bright sunlight without experiencing pain in my eyes.\" O'Neil finds he has better night vision than his colleagues, clearly an asset when searching for faint astronomical objects. Some 16% of women are carriers for colour-blindness. It has been suggested that this kind of vision helps in search tasks (like finding berries), whereas colour-blind men may have evolved as superior hunters. Even if you can't see the same colours as other people, maybe you can still see things they can't.",

      "body": "<p>We are witnesses to a new millennium, a new year, but an old story: an earthquake in Gujarat, in India, and an earthquake in Central America, on the rim of fire. The toll is tragically familiar. In the first, more than 10,000 dead and cities, towns and villages in ruins. In the second, hundreds dead, even more missing, thousands of homes demolished, two-fifths of all hospital capacity destroyed, one-fifth of all school buildings rendered unusable. </p> <p>This terrible loss was not necessary. The earthquake did not kill these people. A combination of human error, indifference, corruption and greed killed them. It is not part of the human condition to be crushed and buried under a landslide triggered by an earthquake. Earthquakes happen. But the disaster follows because of human action and inaction. </p> <p>Gujarat is an economic powerhouse in India. One sees there in microcosm the enormous gap between rich and poor that characterises India itself, and the world. Much of this economic growth is linked to global markets. Its successful economy has come at the cost of having to accommodate somewhere a very large population of unskilled labour. These people migrated there from all over northern India because their lives as landless labourers elsewhere were untenable. It is regrettably easy to guess the root causes of death and loss by the poor and marginalised in Gujarat. In the case of the middle-income neighbourhood of Las Colinas in Santa Tecla, just outside the capital San Salvador, 400 homes were lost beneath a wall of debris from a collapsing slope above. </p> <p>This was not an \"act of God\". A group of Las Colinas residents and environmental groups were in court only last year to stop development on that slope and the ridge above. The judge ruled against them. Experts agree that steep slopes made of volcanic soil are unstable. Geologists know this. Planners know this. It isn't rocket science. </p> <p>Why not set our sights on an international treaty that commits governments around the world to applying low-cost solutions based on available knowledge to prevent such tragic loss? The knowledge exists. It is possible to identify zones subject to landslide. The engineering knowledge exists and there are building codes that would provide for survivable collapse of most buildings. </p> <p>There are networks of scientists and engineers who could take on the technical work of defining standards. These networks were created in part by the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (1990-99) - 10 years of scientific exchange mandated by the United Nations. Science was exchanged all right, but generally it hasn't been applied. </p> <p>Such an effort would require thousands of experts to work out the low-cost, minimum practices required to avoid further such tragedies. These scientists and engineers would have to sit down with lawyers, legislators and policy experts to work out how the minimum standards would be enforced. The devil is in the details, but scientists and lawyers eat details for breakfast. </p> <p> T his is not an impossible task. It has happened before. There are many internationally agreed safety standards for the chemical industry, airline industry, nuclear power industry etc. It has happened already where global warming is concerned. Hundreds of agencies involved in providing disaster relief reached agreement last year on minimum standards in disaster response. Thousands of technical people discussed details of water supply, sanitation, food, shelter and health care. </p> <p>What is to be done during the years that such a treaty is in the making? The beauty of this process is that the low-cost solutions will filter into society. Citizens groups will demand action by their governments, as they did in Turkey when it became clear that contractors hadn't followed building codes and had used low-quality materials. Prevention of disasters has to come from the bottom up as well as from the top down. </p> <p>Absolute safety is not a human right. Safety from avoidable loss, injury and death is. Nothing in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights makes much sense if the human beings who are supposed to enjoy these rights can be snuffed out because a government neglected to enforce its own building codes. Rights are not given. Throughout history they have had to be demanded and constructed. It will take all of our efforts and the combined efforts of all sectors - businesses, churches, universities, environmental groups and governments - to finish the unfinished business of the Disaster Decade. </p> <p>More at: <a href=\"http://www.anglia.ac.uk/geography/radix/\">www.anglia.ac.uk/geography/radix</a> </p> <p> \u0095 Ben Wisner is a researcher in the environmental studies programme at Oberlin College, Ohio, is vice-chair of the International Geographical Union's commission on hazards and risks, and a research coordinator for the United Nations University's project on urban disasters.</p>",

Gujarat is an economic powerhouse in India. One sees there in microcosm the enormous gap between rich and poor that characterises India itself, and the world. Much of this economic growth is linked to global markets. Its successful economy has come at the cost of having to accommodate somewhere a very large population of unskilled labour. These people migrated there from all over northern India because their lives as landless labourers elsewhere were untenable. It is regrettably easy to guess the root causes of death and loss by the poor and marginalised in Gujarat. In the case of the middle-income neighbourhood of Las Colinas in Santa Tecla, just outside the capital San Salvador, 400 homes were lost beneath a wall of debris from a collapsing slope above. This was not an \"act of God\". A group of Las Colinas residents and environmental groups were in court only last year to stop development on that slope and the ridge above. The judge ruled against them. Experts agree that steep slopes made of volcanic soil are unstable. Geologists know this. Planners know this. It isn't rocket science. Why not set our sights on an international treaty that commits governments around the world to applying low-cost solutions based on available knowledge to prevent such tragic loss? The knowledge exists. It is possible to identify zones subject to landslide. The engineering knowledge exists and there are building codes that would provide for survivable collapse of most buildings. There are networks of scientists and engineers who could take on the technical work of defining standards. These networks were created in part by the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (1990-99) - 10 years of scientific exchange mandated by the United Nations. Science was exchanged all right, but generally it hasn't been applied. Such an effort would require thousands of experts to work out the low-cost, minimum practices required to avoid further such tragedies. These scientists and engineers would have to sit down with lawyers, legislators and policy experts to work out how the minimum standards would be enforced. The devil is in the details, but scientists and lawyers eat details for breakfast. T his is not an impossible task. It has happened before. There are many internationally agreed safety standards for the chemical industry, airline industry, nuclear power industry etc. It has happened already where global warming is concerned. Hundreds of agencies involved in providing disaster relief reached agreement last year on minimum standards in disaster response. Thousands of technical people discussed details of water supply, sanitation, food, shelter and health care. What is to be done during the years that such a treaty is in the making? The beauty of this process is that the low-cost solutions will filter into society. Citizens groups will demand action by their governments, as they did in Turkey when it became clear that contractors hadn't followed building codes and had used low-quality materials. Prevention of disasters has to come from the bottom up as well as from the top down. Absolute safety is not a human right. Safety from avoidable loss, injury and death is. Nothing in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights makes much sense if the human beings who are supposed to enjoy these rights can be snuffed out because a government neglected to enforce its own building codes. Rights are not given. Throughout history they have had to be demanded and constructed. It will take all of our efforts and the combined efforts of all sectors - businesses, churches, universities, environmental groups and governments - to finish the unfinished business of the Disaster Decade.

      "body": "<p>First Tuesday seems to have been accused in the press of having had its last Tuesday almost every day since it was known that its parent company Yazam was on the brink of collapse. Despite the difficulties and First Tuesday's uncertain future, two of its co-founders still can't resist hosting networking events. </p> <p>That both Julie Meyer and Nick Denton still run such events is testament to their belief that there is still a place for these informal gatherings. </p> <p>They have, however, recognised the need to change with the times. It is no longer simply a case of cramming as many venture capitalists (VCs) and entrepreneurs as possible in the same room. </p> <p>Julie Meyer says: \"You wouldn't start a First Tuesday today - the market has moved on. Networking events are getting much more focused, whereas First Tuesday was a mirror of the community and that was about getting big fast.\" Her latest venture Ariadne Capital hopes to achieve what First Tuesday never did: to leverage the network she has built up and to monetise it. </p> <p>In tandem with this \"extension of First Tuesday\" the self-confessed networking addict holds dinner parties each Friday for eight personally invited guests. \"There are so many people I'd like to meet. It's like so and so has just been made a partner at a VC firm and I want to see them but I can't do 24 lunches in one week. Whether it's exclusive or not it serves my needs,\" she says. </p> <p>Nick Denton says the problem with such elite events is that they have a natural evolution to become mass-market. To avoid this he is extremely strict about who is invited to the Eurotrash networking event he runs in San Francisco. \"It's a pretty exclusive event with a well-judged invited list since that's when networking happens,\" he says. </p> <p>Of the 700 people on the mailing list up to 250 are invited to the \"amazing mansion\" (which was previously owned by the head of Sotheby's in San Francisco) of Denton's business acquaintance and chief executive of web-enabling company Obongo, John Hunt. </p> <p>This is far removed from the Alphabet Bar in Soho, the venue of the inaugural First Tuesday event in October 1998, which Denton is happy to leave behind. \"Adam Gold, another First Tuesday founder, and I have learnt our lesson,\" he says. </p> <p>Along with elite events come premiere sponsors and Denton has attracted a major name, the American venture capital company Benchmark Capital, which famously backed eBay, and Europ@Web, which infamously backed Boo.com, to foot the bill for his Eurotrash events. </p> <p>Also priding itself on attracting sponsors through the exclusivity of the people it allows to attend its monthly events is The Chemistry. Its chief executive, Mark Simon, says: \"We live and die by the screening of our guest list. If we didn't do this then we wouldn't get hundreds of thousands of pounds in sponsorship from the likes of Oracle, Cable &amp; Wireless and WestLB Panmure. First Tuesday didn't screen so they couldn't guarantee a high quality audience. We don't want a VC getting collared by a wannabe entrepreneur.\" </p> <p>Xav Adam, publicist for multimedia companies including gadget seller Firebox.com and an inveterate networker, believes this is exactly what should happen at such events and is critical of screening policies. \"Events that are over strict on screening seem too self-important. They have their fans but they are just too contrived.\" </p> <p>Simon argues that his screening process helps him provide the ideal forum for the VC and serial entrepreneur communities to meet. \"It has evolved into a Groucho Club for the cream of VCs and serial entrepreneurs. There is nowhere else for them to go.\" </p> <p>As evidence he lists Mark Bernstein, chief executive of Gameplay, John Palmer, founder of LetsBuyIt.com, George Coelho, partner at Benchmark Capital, Jon Moulton of Alchemy and Hermann Hauser, founder of UK-based VC firm Amadeus Capital as previous visitors to The Chemistry evenings. </p> <p>Along with such events that focus on business to attract people, there are the purely social networking events. Adam believes these have a far greater shelf life: \"Without doubt the more sociable ones will survive as they are based on real people and real relationships. People go because they like the people they can talk to.\" </p> <p>Geoff Inns, founder of the popular Boob Night (acronym for \"Bring Our Own Beer\") formed in November 1998 as a purely social occasion with no agenda, strongly agrees: \"We have no compelling proposition - no free beer, no entertainment and no speakers but every month 300 to 350 people come along because it's got the type of people that they want to meet.\" </p> <p>However, with a serious dearth of quality staff in the dotcom and technology sectors it is not surprising that networking events such as Boob Night are targets for recruitment companies looking for staff for their clients. \"We have hoards of recruitment people roving around. Whenever we announce the need for sponsorships for our annual Boob Night Awards we get loads of calls from them.\" Inns even pokes fun at the recruitment companies with the joke emails he sends to his mailing list. His message for the February Boob Night included the line: \"Recruitment Consultants - bring your credit cards, stack them behind the bar, and command us to drink!\" </p> <p>Also attracting interest from recruitment companies is the Clerkenwell Social, formed jointly by Guardian Unlimited and online business information provider Moreover.com, of which Denton is chief executive. </p> <p>But even with the potential of using their money to sponsor the monthly Socials, Jennifer McCormick, head of business development at Moreover.com and one of the organisers of the Social, says recruitment companies wouldn't be allowed in to their event unless they were based in the Clerkenwell area. </p> <p>This restriction enables the Social to continue to attract a mix of people from local companies. \"The idea was to mix people from some of the diverse businesses based in Clerkenwell in a social environment and to also help local bars and art galleries by holding our events with them,\" says McCormick. </p> <p> It also tries to appeal to people from the coalface rather than the boardroom. \"It's not for chief executives and VCs but more for techies and creatives. If you are not from the area or are a VC then you are not allowed in.\" Regulars include staffers from Freeserve, Flutter.com, Screaming Media, Revolution Ltd and Razorfish. </p> <p>Also spreading its net wider than the net is the Glasshouse, which seeks to attract people from a broad range of sectors rather than just dot.coms and technology. According to founder Judith Clegg, strategic director of the create-your-own-website company Moonfruit, this has helped insulate it from the dot.com downturn. </p> <p>\"Our dot.com links have helped us but we always wanted to be cross-sector and, unlike First Tuesday, we were not about people finding funding but more about sharing ideas,\" says Clegg. As a result, no more than 40% of those attending Glasshouse's monthly events are involved in the technology sector. </p> <p>Although not moving away from its technology heritage, First Tuesday is also shifting away from being a platform for finding funding and will instead focus more on sharing ideas at more focused and segmented events. </p> <p>John Browning, First Tuesday co-founder and head of its London events, says: \"We are still thriving and there is lots of interest in our meetings but we will have to change. When we started we were about funding but the market has moved on and we have to as well. We will have more segmented events as it's no longer relevant to talk about the web as a whole - we are seeing different parts of the value chain coming through.\" As examples of this change, recent First Tuesday events have focused on online investment, games and recreation and e-learning. </p> <p>Similarly, Glasshouse also prides itself on providing high-quality speakers, and again, who will appeal to its diverse membership. They have included Luke Johnson, founder of Pizza Express, Julie Meyer, Simon Woodroffe, founder of YO! Sushi, the public relations guru Lynne Franks, and Trevor Baylis, the inventor of the windup radio. </p> <p>With this diversity Clegg says the Glasshouse is booming - so much so that she has been forced to appoint a part-time events manager (who also looks after singer Lulu) and introduce an entrance fee of \u00a310 to pay her wages. \"We've always had a huge demand as people want high-quality speakers in an informal atmosphere. These are enduring things and people like to come along to find out about new things but without having an agenda,\" she explains. </p> <p>There are clearly still many events to keep the keen networker out most nights of the week despite the dark cloud hanging over the dot.com and technology sector. But according to Denton this may not continue for much longer. </p> <p>Although all events lay claim to their own individuality that will ensure their survival, Denton is less than convinced and predicts that the UK will follow the trend in the US, where many networking events have been disappearing fast. </p> <p>\"The usual round of events has been curtailed as there is not as much exuberance in the sector and people also have lives to lead and need time for a social life.\" As a result, he predicts that the next downturn in the technology sector could \"completely wipe out London\", and the knock-on effect will prompt the demise of many networking events. The best advice would therefore appear to be: network while you can.</p>",

      "body": "<p>In Douglas Coupland's 1995 novel Microserfs, a bunch of 20-something computer programmers flee their jobs at Microsoft Seattle to set up a company called Oops! in Silicon Valley. Short for object oriented programming system, Oops! is described as \"virtual Lego - a bottomless box of 3D Lego-type bricks that runs on IBM or Mac platforms.\" </p> <p>It is nearly six years since Coupland's Lego-inspired heroes made their bold getaway from Bill Gates' fold, but if Oops! were a real company and had survived the dotcom crash thus far, its founders might sense something ironic about Microsoft's recently announced alliance with Lego. </p> <p>On January 10, the two companies announced the \"shared dream\" of developing joint products and services. As part of the deal, which some analysts label timely considering the toy-maker's expected loss of 500m kroner (\u00a340m) for 2000, Microsoft applications will run on Lego's website and Lego will develop games for the technology conglomerate's new Xbox games console, Microsoft's retort to Sega and Sony. </p> <p>Lego has come a long way since its wholesome beginnings as a family run manufacturer of wooden toys in Billund, Denmark. Master carpenter Ole Kirk Christiansen founded the company in 1932, coining the term Lego from two Danish words: LEg GOdt, meaning \"play well\". By the time the plastic brick came out in 1949, Lego was becoming a phenomenon in Denmark. </p> <p>The Lego Company now ranks among the top five makers of children's products worldwide, its empire spreading beyond colourful kits to clothes, Harry Potter and three theme parks. \"There are 52 Lego bricks to every person in the world,\" says Danielle Hainauer, head of public relations for Lego Europe north. </p> <p>But Lego's success story is not spotless. Two years ago, the company suffered the first financial loss in its history, owing to today's tech-savvy kids plumping for the virtual world of the computer game over Lego's lively building blocks. \"Kids are getting older younger, so it's not just about producing classic play materials any more,\" says Hainauer. </p> <p>Focused upon becoming, in company rhetoric, \"the strongest brand for families and children by 2005\", Lego's widespread cross-branding efforts look like a reasonable way to recoup recent losses and recapture the interests of the fickle children's market. </p> <p>Following a successful franchise of the Star Wars brand, Lego has won the rights to work its magic on Harry Potter. The company has developed a movie-making kit for children, Lego Studios, in conjunction with Steven Spielberg and has just launched Lego INmotion, an in-car play-station, with Johnson's Controls, a leading designer of car interiors. </p> <p>For some of Lego's older fans, the partnership with other companies, and especially with Microsoft, is a cause for concern. \"A lot of people are worried that the Lego Company is spreading itself too thin,\" says Todd Lehman, founder of Lugnet, the web-based global community of Lego users. \"Lego has always represented quality and high moral standards and many Lego fans feel that Microsoft is only interested in making money.\" </p> <p>Lego might be focusing on building its brand right now, but its relationship with technology is more profound than its liaisons with a few household names. Ever since Lego financed the development of the \"intelligent\" brick at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the 1980s, an adult crowd of nostalgic high- tech Lego users have played with the souped-up Mindstorms robotics kits as passionately as they played with space Lego when they were kids. But as Mitchel Resnick, Lego Pappert Professor at MIT is quick to point out, \"there's a great deal of technology in even the simplest Lego brick\". </p> <p>With the rise of online communities such as Lugnet.com, and the smooth circulation of Lego parts through eBay and the specialist Lego exchange BrickBay, people have been able to share ideas and build more creatively than ever. Lego has become a staple in the creative process for artists and scientists alike. \"Lego produces great raw materials and the fans constantly create new ways of using the bricks,\" says Lehman. </p> <p>Larry Page, the 28-year-old boss of Google, the search engine, built himself an inkjet printer out of Lego, while Yali Friedman, a Canadian biochemistry PhD student, used a Lego model to explain on television the structure of DNA. Eric Harshbarger, a 30-year-old computer programmer and Lego sculptor from Alabama, has created life-sized sculptures out of Lego, from a full-length desk for a corporate client to a Lego version of Bart Simpson, while computer consultant Jason Rowoldt makes hour-long movies using Lego with his company BrickFilms. </p> <p> The Lego Company itself has been instrumental in supporting the technological endeavours of its customers. For Harshbarger, the company's decision to sell Lego bricks in bulk online has made his job as a large-scale Lego sculptor much easier. Rowoldt, 25, describes Lego's plan to enable customers to create and order their own custom-made sets online as \"every Lego fan's dream\". </p> <p>On the educational side, a new partnership between Lego and First, a non-profit organisation concerned with establishing an interest in science and engineering in young people, aims to teach children about technology through a national robotics competition for nine to 14 year-olds. </p> <p>Perhaps most intriguing is the Lego Company's attitude towards hackers. No sooner had the first Mindstorms kit appeared on toy store shelves in 1998 than a student had hacked into the program, reverse-engineered it and posted his work on the internet. \"We could have gone after that person from a propriety point of view,\" says Michael McNally, Lego's public relations manager for the Americas, \"but we decided to encourage a dialogue with hackers instead\". </p> <p>Since then, hackers have created new programs for Mindstorms, generating a community of robotics enthusiasts, creating new capabilities for Lego's products and attracting revenue for the company. Lego has posted a free downloadable version of the developers kit on its web-site and several books have been published on programming Mindstorms, including Ralph Hempel's Advanced Guide To Lego Mindstorms and Jonathan Knudsen's Unofficial Guide To Lego Mindstorms. </p> <p>\"Lego has been phenomenally receptive to people experimenting with their software. They are a credit to the open-source movement,\" says Harshbarger. </p> <p>\"Technology has created a huge paradigm shift for the traditional, family owned company that had been manufacturing plastics for 50 years,\" says Knudsen. Yet according to Douglas Coupland, Lego may have a great deal further to go before it realises even a modicum of its potential: \"In a thousand years from now, Lego will have done more to influence the thinking of a lot of people and the look of the physical world than pretty well any other invention,\" said the Microserfs author in an interview for Danish national television. That remains to be seen, but in the meantime, be careful not to trip over passing droids in the street and watch out for the giant robotic cockroach programmed to tickle you in bed.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In Douglas Coupland's 1995 novel Microserfs, a bunch of 20-something computer programmers flee their jobs at Microsoft Seattle to set up a company called Oops! in Silicon Valley. Short for object oriented programming system, Oops! is described as \"virtual Lego - a bottomless box of 3D Lego-type bricks that runs on IBM or Mac platforms.\" It is nearly six years since Coupland's Lego-inspired heroes made their bold getaway from Bill Gates' fold, but if Oops! were a real company and had survived the dotcom crash thus far, its founders might sense something ironic about Microsoft's recently announced alliance with Lego. On January 10, the two companies announced the \"shared dream\" of developing joint products and services. As part of the deal, which some analysts label timely considering the toy-maker's expected loss of 500m kroner (\u00a340m) for 2000, Microsoft applications will run on Lego's website and Lego will develop games for the technology conglomerate's new Xbox games console, Microsoft's retort to Sega and Sony. Lego has come a long way since its wholesome beginnings as a family run manufacturer of wooden toys in Billund, Denmark. Master carpenter Ole Kirk Christiansen founded the company in 1932, coining the term Lego from two Danish words: LEg GOdt, meaning \"play well\". By the time the plastic brick came out in 1949, Lego was becoming a phenomenon in Denmark. The Lego Company now ranks among the top five makers of children's products worldwide, its empire spreading beyond colourful kits to clothes, Harry Potter and three theme parks. \"There are 52 Lego bricks to every person in the world,\" says Danielle Hainauer, head of public relations for Lego Europe north. But Lego's success story is not spotless. Two years ago, the company suffered the first financial loss in its history, owing to today's tech-savvy kids plumping for the virtual world of the computer game over Lego's lively building blocks. \"Kids are getting older younger, so it's not just about producing classic play materials any more,\" says Hainauer. Focused upon becoming, in company rhetoric, \"the strongest brand for families and children by 2005\", Lego's widespread cross-branding efforts look like a reasonable way to recoup recent losses and recapture the interests of the fickle children's market. Following a successful franchise of the Star Wars brand, Lego has won the rights to work its magic on Harry Potter. The company has developed a movie-making kit for children, Lego Studios, in conjunction with Steven Spielberg and has just launched Lego INmotion, an in-car play-station, with Johnson's Controls, a leading designer of car interiors. For some of Lego's older fans, the partnership with other companies, and especially with Microsoft, is a cause for concern. \"A lot of people are worried that the Lego Company is spreading itself too thin,\" says Todd Lehman, founder of Lugnet, the web-based global community of Lego users. \"Lego has always represented quality and high moral standards and many Lego fans feel that Microsoft is only interested in making money.\" Lego might be focusing on building its brand right now, but its relationship with technology is more profound than its liaisons with a few household names. Ever since Lego financed the development of the \"intelligent\" brick at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the 1980s, an adult crowd of nostalgic high- tech Lego users have played with the souped-up Mindstorms robotics kits as passionately as they played with space Lego when they were kids. But as Mitchel Resnick, Lego Pappert Professor at MIT is quick to point out, \"there's a great deal of technology in even the simplest Lego brick\". With the rise of online communities such as Lugnet.com, and the smooth circulation of Lego parts through eBay and the specialist Lego exchange BrickBay, people have been able to share ideas and build more creatively than ever. Lego has become a staple in the creative process for artists and scientists alike. \"Lego produces great raw materials and the fans constantly create new ways of using the bricks,\" says Lehman. Larry Page, the 28-year-old boss of Google, the search engine, built himself an inkjet printer out of Lego, while Yali Friedman, a Canadian biochemistry PhD student, used a Lego model to explain on television the structure of DNA. Eric Harshbarger, a 30-year-old computer programmer and Lego sculptor from Alabama, has created life-sized sculptures out of Lego, from a full-length desk for a corporate client to a Lego version of Bart Simpson, while computer consultant Jason Rowoldt makes hour-long movies using Lego with his company BrickFilms. The Lego Company itself has been instrumental in supporting the technological endeavours of its customers. For Harshbarger, the company's decision to sell Lego bricks in bulk online has made his job as a large-scale Lego sculptor much easier. Rowoldt, 25, describes Lego's plan to enable customers to create and order their own custom-made sets online as \"every Lego fan's dream\". On the educational side, a new partnership between Lego and First, a non-profit organisation concerned with establishing an interest in science and engineering in young people, aims to teach children about technology through a national robotics competition for nine to 14 year-olds. Perhaps most intriguing is the Lego Company's attitude towards hackers. No sooner had the first Mindstorms kit appeared on toy store shelves in 1998 than a student had hacked into the program, reverse-engineered it and posted his work on the internet. \"We could have gone after that person from a propriety point of view,\" says Michael McNally, Lego's public relations manager for the Americas, \"but we decided to encourage a dialogue with hackers instead\". Since then, hackers have created new programs for Mindstorms, generating a community of robotics enthusiasts, creating new capabilities for Lego's products and attracting revenue for the company. Lego has posted a free downloadable version of the developers kit on its web-site and several books have been published on programming Mindstorms, including Ralph Hempel's Advanced Guide To Lego Mindstorms and Jonathan Knudsen's Unofficial Guide To Lego Mindstorms. \"Lego has been phenomenally receptive to people experimenting with their software. They are a credit to the open-source movement,\" says Harshbarger. \"Technology has created a huge paradigm shift for the traditional, family owned company that had been manufacturing plastics for 50 years,\" says Knudsen. Yet according to Douglas Coupland, Lego may have a great deal further to go before it realises even a modicum of its potential: \"In a thousand years from now, Lego will have done more to influence the thinking of a lot of people and the look of the physical world than pretty well any other invention,\" said the Microserfs author in an interview for Danish national television. That remains to be seen, but in the meantime, be careful not to trip over passing droids in the street and watch out for the giant robotic cockroach programmed to tickle you in bed.",

After all, why spend \u00a31,000-plus on a PC to play games normally associated with consoles that cost a tenth of the price? </p> <p>Well, perhaps Oni may buck the trend. Ostensibly a Tomb Raider-style, third-person adventure, Oni throws in some sublime high-kicking action to create something almost unique on the PC. Starring a sassy female lead, Konoko, the game uses an anim\u00e9 style that helps convey a clich\u00e9d post-apocalyptic scenario: apparently the world is controlled by a nasty dictatorship. </p> <p>Thankfully, the game offers plenty of action to compensate for this lame storyline. From the off, the action is fast paced. Despite early misgivings, the mouse/keyboard control system works remarkably well, with well-timed clicks leading to some exquisite onscreen martial arts. As the game progresses, you learn combat skills to put to good use against the increasingly tough adversaries. Unfortunately, the carelessly discarded weapons don't help. Konoko can only hold one gun at a time and, with ammo scarce, it's obvious that flying fists are the only way to go. </p> <p>However, it doesn't take long to notice the problems - mainly, that Oni is rather samey. Work your way down grey corridor, find keys, kick assailant, open door. Repeat. Sure, scrapping your way out of a four-guard sandwich is satisfying but it is not long before you hanker for a bit of variety. It is not as if the graphics reward your progression: Oni is strictly average-looking. </p> <p>Nevertheless, for allowing PC owners some guilt-free, mindless action, Oni should be applauded. (GH) </p> <p> <strong> Ultimate Fighting Championship</strong> <br> Sega Dreamcast \u00a339.99 Crave/Ubi Soft *** <br> Awkward. If you are a fan of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, then this game is a dream come true. If you don't even know what it is, then it may be more of a nightmare. </p> <p>The UFC is, apparently, a serious business, where men with a variety of skills fight it out in an octagonal cage. \"Mixed martial arts\", they call it. Boxing, kickboxing, jiu-jitsu, sumo wrestling and other techniques may be employed. Crave's licensed version is a simulation of the sport, based on a roster of 22 well-known fighters who are, to judge by pictures of the real thing, accurately portrayed. </p> <p>So far, so good - or is it bad? </p> <p>On games consoles, the most popular fighting games are mostly fantasy and the most entertaining take a cartoon-style approach. Even in what passes for real life, the soap opera aspects of the various fight games have become more important than the stage-managed physical conflicts, a trend taken to its logical conclusion by the WWF. However, UFC is different. It is a fight simulator and if you don't like fighting, it is not much fun. </p> <p>UFC is also hard. Sure, you will win a few bouts, but you can soon get matched against people who finish you off in seconds, leaving you with no clue how you might win. </p> <p>When previewed at the E3 games trade show in Los Angeles last year, UFC was voted Best Fighting Game. </p> <p>There is no doubt about its quality, so it might be worth a try. Whether you would want your children to play it is another matter. (JS)</p> <p> <strong> Heist</strong><br> \u00a329.99 Crimson/ Virgin Interactive ** <br> Those of you who are too old to wear trainers might just remember Bullfrog releasing a strategy game called Syndicate. In it you controlled a squad of cybernetically enhanced troopers, whose objectives were to rob banks, dodge cops and recruit members. </p> <p>There was more of the same in the sequel, Syndicate Wars, but even that seems a lifetime ago. </p> <p>Load up a game of Heist and the memories will come flooding back. No sci-fi trappings here - instead of supermen, you are in charge of a gang of eminently mortal criminals - but otherwise it's a dead ringer, from the isometric view that too often leaves your men hidden behind buildings, to the awkwardly scrolling maps, to the inability to save during missions. And while the resolution of the graphics is higher, smaller character models mean that goodies, baddies and in-betweenies are all pretty much indistinguishable. </p> <p>The similarities to a long-dead title aren't the only source of unease. Now that the action is set in the real world - albeit in the US - the relentless crime and bloodshed, with the added bonus of language that would do the Sopranos proud, are all the more disturbing. </p> <p>None of this would matter if the game was fun. But there are more amusing things to do than send dots around a screen accumulating virtual cash and then making them hide for minutes at a time while the \"suspicionometer\" bar dribbles down to zero. The interface is no barrel of laughs, either: although everything is controllable by mouse, the drop-down menus can be fiddly and there don't appear to be any keyboard shortcuts (certainly, none was supplied in the documentation). </p> <p>If you've just come out of jail and haven't touched a computer game since Syndicate, you might just enjoy this. Hell, you probably designed it. (AB)</p>",

Starring a sassy female lead, Konoko, the game uses an anim\u00e9 style that helps convey a clich\u00e9d post-apocalyptic scenario: apparently the world is controlled by a nasty dictatorship. Thankfully, the game offers plenty of action to compensate for this lame storyline. From the off, the action is fast paced. Despite early misgivings, the mouse/keyboard control system works remarkably well, with well-timed clicks leading to some exquisite onscreen martial arts. As the game progresses, you learn combat skills to put to good use against the increasingly tough adversaries. Unfortunately, the carelessly discarded weapons don't help. Konoko can only hold one gun at a time and, with ammo scarce, it's obvious that flying fists are the only way to go. However, it doesn't take long to notice the problems - mainly, that Oni is rather samey. Work your way down grey corridor, find keys, kick assailant, open door. Repeat. Sure, scrapping your way out of a four-guard sandwich is satisfying but it is not long before you hanker for a bit of variety. It is not as if the graphics reward your progression: Oni is strictly average-looking. Nevertheless, for allowing PC owners some guilt-free, mindless action, Oni should be applauded. (GH) Ultimate Fighting Championship Sega Dreamcast \u00a339.99 Crave/Ubi Soft *** Awkward. If you are a fan of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, then this game is a dream come true. If you don't even know what it is, then it may be more of a nightmare. The UFC is, apparently, a serious business, where men with a variety of skills fight it out in an octagonal cage. \"Mixed martial arts\", they call it. Boxing, kickboxing, jiu-jitsu, sumo wrestling and other techniques may be employed. Crave's licensed version is a simulation of the sport, based on a roster of 22 well-known fighters who are, to judge by pictures of the real thing, accurately portrayed. So far, so good - or is it bad? On games consoles, the most popular fighting games are mostly fantasy and the most entertaining take a cartoon-style approach. Even in what passes for real life, the soap opera aspects of the various fight games have become more important than the stage-managed physical conflicts, a trend taken to its logical conclusion by the WWF. However, UFC is different. It is a fight simulator and if you don't like fighting, it is not much fun. UFC is also hard. Sure, you will win a few bouts, but you can soon get matched against people who finish you off in seconds, leaving you with no clue how you might win. When previewed at the E3 games trade show in Los Angeles last year, UFC was voted Best Fighting Game. There is no doubt about its quality, so it might be worth a try. Whether you would want your children to play it is another matter. (JS) Heist \u00a329.99 Crimson/ Virgin Interactive ** Those of you who are too old to wear trainers might just remember Bullfrog releasing a strategy game called Syndicate. In it you controlled a squad of cybernetically enhanced troopers, whose objectives were to rob banks, dodge cops and recruit members. There was more of the same in the sequel, Syndicate Wars, but even that seems a lifetime ago. Load up a game of Heist and the memories will come flooding back. No sci-fi trappings here - instead of supermen, you are in charge of a gang of eminently mortal criminals - but otherwise it's a dead ringer, from the isometric view that too often leaves your men hidden behind buildings, to the awkwardly scrolling maps, to the inability to save during missions. And while the resolution of the graphics is higher, smaller character models mean that goodies, baddies and in-betweenies are all pretty much indistinguishable. The similarities to a long-dead title aren't the only source of unease. Now that the action is set in the real world - albeit in the US - the relentless crime and bloodshed, with the added bonus of language that would do the Sopranos proud, are all the more disturbing. None of this would matter if the game was fun. But there are more amusing things to do than send dots around a screen accumulating virtual cash and then making them hide for minutes at a time while the \"suspicionometer\" bar dribbles down to zero. The interface is no barrel of laughs, either: although everything is controllable by mouse, the drop-down menus can be fiddly and there don't appear to be any keyboard shortcuts (certainly, none was supplied in the documentation). If you've just come out of jail and haven't touched a computer game since Syndicate, you might just enjoy this. Hell, you probably designed it. (AB)",

      "body": "<p>Here's a question for sports trivia buffs. Who was the first snooker player to clinch a maximum 147 break live on the net? Answer: Marco Fu, Regal Scottish Masters, October 25, 2000. That month, thanks to its pathfinding showing of BBC Scotland's pictures supported by their own studio coverage, <a href=\"http://www.tsnsnooker.com\">www.tsnsnooker.com</a> recorded a huge number of visits from around the world, from Taiwan to Tonga. </p> <p>For some, the prospect of watching live non-stop snooker is roughly equivalent to having to listen to a loop tape of the speeches of Sir Geoffrey Howe. </p> <p>On the other hand, there's no denying the potential compulsiveness of being able to check in every 10 minutes at the office for the latest score in a thrilling quarter final between Ronnie O'Sullivan and John Higgins. </p> <p>TSN stands for The Sportsmaster's Network; it's based in East Kilbride and the 5-man board includes Ian Doyle, manager of world champions Stephen Hendry, Mark Williams and Ronnie O'Sullivan. As soon as the site came online last April it received 600,000 hits, not only from traditional snooker-watching countries such as China, Australia, Canada, Thailand and Holland, but from newer customer bases in the Middle East, the Balkans and South America. </p> <p>\"We're now averaging just over a million hits a week which is not bad at all given that we're not advertising,\" says managing director Gerry Sinclair. </p> <p>What seems obvious is that TSN will drive online betting. \"We're not a gaming or betting company per se,\" says Sin clair, \"but companies that are think this is a highly lucrative market. It encourages people to bet who wouldn't necessarily go into betting shops.\" Sinclair cites older people and women as a new market, and it is certainly an appealing vision - the little old ladies who currently make up a large portion of snooker's TV audience using the net for a flutter. </p> <p>Sinclair reckons that snooker has an advantage over faster-moving sports such as football or rugby. \"The beauty of it is that you hit a ball, it rolls and stops, and the player thinks about his next shot, giving the technology the chance to catch up. In 12-18 months, bandwidth will have improved and the faster-moving sports will get a look in, but in the meantime darts, bowls and golf all lend themselves to this coverage.\" </p> <p>The site is exciting, colourful and fast - more Jimmy 'Whirlwind' White than Steve 'Interesting' Davis. As well as live pictures when available, it offers strong news and feature content, up-to-date results and scoring, online magazine On-Q, chat rooms to post questions to players, and analysis from players and pundits. </p> <p>Currently, the webcam is backstage at the Nations Cup, showing players chatting, a bit like Big Brother with waistcoats and bow ties. </p> <p>Belated competition is provided by <a href=\"http://www.worldsnooker.com\">www.worldsnooker.com</a> - the governing body's own site. It is well done, if more formal than its rival, and might suffer from its late arrival. Fans should also check out <a href=\"http://www.snookerscene.com\">www.snookerscene.com</a>, the online version of Snooker Scene, the sport's paper of record. </p> <p>\"Ours is more of a news operation,\" says Sinclair. \"When radio first started in the US, all these little independent radio stations were set up, and we see ourselves like that, a small broadcasting station for snooker, and your first port of call. And the beauty of the internet is that you can do the stuff more cheaply than anywhere else.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Here's a question for sports trivia buffs. Who was the first snooker player to clinch a maximum 147 break live on the net? Answer: Marco Fu, Regal Scottish Masters, October 25, 2000. That month, thanks to its pathfinding showing of BBC Scotland's pictures supported by their own studio coverage, www.tsnsnooker.com recorded a huge number of visits from around the world, from Taiwan to Tonga. For some, the prospect of watching live non-stop snooker is roughly equivalent to having to listen to a loop tape of the speeches of Sir Geoffrey Howe. On the other hand, there's no denying the potential compulsiveness of being able to check in every 10 minutes at the office for the latest score in a thrilling quarter final between Ronnie O'Sullivan and John Higgins. TSN stands for The Sportsmaster's Network; it's based in East Kilbride and the 5-man board includes Ian Doyle, manager of world champions Stephen Hendry, Mark Williams and Ronnie O'Sullivan. As soon as the site came online last April it received 600,000 hits, not only from traditional snooker-watching countries such as China, Australia, Canada, Thailand and Holland, but from newer customer bases in the Middle East, the Balkans and South America. \"We're now averaging just over a million hits a week which is not bad at all given that we're not advertising,\" says managing director Gerry Sinclair. What seems obvious is that TSN will drive online betting. \"We're not a gaming or betting company per se,\" says Sin clair, \"but companies that are think this is a highly lucrative market. It encourages people to bet who wouldn't necessarily go into betting shops.\" Sinclair cites older people and women as a new market, and it is certainly an appealing vision - the little old ladies who currently make up a large portion of snooker's TV audience using the net for a flutter. Sinclair reckons that snooker has an advantage over faster-moving sports such as football or rugby. \"The beauty of it is that you hit a ball, it rolls and stops, and the player thinks about his next shot, giving the technology the chance to catch up. In 12-18 months, bandwidth will have improved and the faster-moving sports will get a look in, but in the meantime darts, bowls and golf all lend themselves to this coverage.\" The site is exciting, colourful and fast - more Jimmy 'Whirlwind' White than Steve 'Interesting' Davis. As well as live pictures when available, it offers strong news and feature content, up-to-date results and scoring, online magazine On-Q, chat rooms to post questions to players, and analysis from players and pundits. Currently, the webcam is backstage at the Nations Cup, showing players chatting, a bit like Big Brother with waistcoats and bow ties. Belated competition is provided by www.worldsnooker.com - the governing body's own site. It is well done, if more formal than its rival, and might suffer from its late arrival. Fans should also check out www.snookerscene.com, the online version of Snooker Scene, the sport's paper of record. \"Ours is more of a news operation,\" says Sinclair. \"When radio first started in the US, all these little independent radio stations were set up, and we see ourselves like that, a small broadcasting station for snooker, and your first port of call. And the beauty of the internet is that you can do the stuff more cheaply than anywhere else.\"",

      "body": "<p>Fabric, the trendy nightclub opposite Smithfield Market in London, was packed as usual on Tuesday evening. But this was a night with a difference - the club, which boasts celebrity members such as Kate Moss and Mel C, was full of Pret a Manger managers.</p> <p>The sandwich chain's 400 supervisors had been invited to listen to a speech by its founders, Sinclair Beecham and Julian Metcalfe, both fresh from banking multi-million pound cheques. The company, which makes much of being \"passionate about people\", wanted its staff to be the first to know about a new investor - McDonald's had snapped up a 33% stake.</p> <p>For a firm which prides itself on its \"heart and soul\" and constantly stresses its fresh, healthy food, the arrival of the golden arches marked a very rapid change in culture. Pret a Manger took its name from a shop in Hampstead - the genteel suburb which battled for years to keep out McDonald's.</p> <p>The sandwich chain has made its name as an environmentally friendly trader, banning genetically modified foods and sourcing chickens from humane cages in Seville. For many staff, the idea of a link with McDonald's, which has been demonised by the green lobby, was horrifying.</p> <p>It also spelt the end of the brilliantly constructed illusion through which Pret seemed to offer a taste of sophistication for little more than the cost of a greasy spoon bacon sarnie. In its early days, the chain's brushed steel stools, magenta labels and immaculate chrome bars seemed the ultimate in industrial chic. Its French name and comparatively adventurous menu all helped create an aura of exclusivity - instead of ham and tomato sandwiches, Pret offered Brie, tomato and basil baguettes.</p> <p>The origins of Pret's classy three-quid lunches lie in the mid-1980s, when its two creators met at the Polytechnic of Central London (now the University of Westminster), where they were studying property law.</p> <p>Nine months after graduating, Metcalfe was working as a surveyor in Jermyn Street, getting increasingly fed up with \"soggy sandwiches and mush\" for lunch, often served with a snarl, from local sandwich shops. Deciding he could do better, he got together with Beecham to open the first Pret a Manger in Victoria, with a kitchen in the basement.</p> <p>Things got off to a slow start. Metcalfe recalls: \"It was a lot harder than it looked.\"</p> <p>Although they began with a loan of just \u00a317,000, the pair resolved to offer only high quality, fresh food: \"Half the battle was getting preservative-free, chemical-free food. And it was an immense logistical challenge to get the ingredients delivered every morning.\"</p> <p>Initially, the pair shopped themselves at local markets. Metcalfe used to go in on Sunday evenings to cook 25 chickens, ready to stuff sandwiches the next morning. For inspiration, they recalled the first meal they had shared - \"warmed-over pork and vegetables\" at a college canteen called the Blue Lagoon - with its blue walls and carpet tiles, the antithesis of what they wanted Pret to be.</p> <p>It was three years before a second Pret opened and at that point, the concept took off. Healthy eating had become a fad in the early 90s and hurried commuters liked the idea of fresh food, prepared daily on the premises, which they could pick up off the shelf.</p> <p>Jim Winship, a director of the British Sandwich Association, says: \"Pret was in the right place, at the right time. There was a revolution going on in sandwiches - packaged sandwiches were finally taking off in a big way, mostly thanks to Marks &amp; Spencer.\"</p> <p>Pret has always been clear about who its customers are - at \u00a31.20 for a tiny bottle of orange juice, it is targetting urban professionals with little time on their hands. The chain now has just over 100 shops in Britain, and one in New York. Last year it sold 25m sandwiches, baguettes and wraps and just over 14m cups of coffee. Pret sandwiches are still made on the premises, at every store. Shops receive fresh deliveries in the evenings, which are refrigerated every night until cooks arrive at 6.30am to prepare the day's sandwiches.</p> <p>While Beecham holds the purse-strings, Metcalfe looks after the food - he spends Thursday afternoon with a recipe committee, sampling different ideas. He goes for exotic mixtures, once remarking: \"The English respond to strong tastes - look at curry.\" Recent additions include Scotch beef with crispy onions, \"More than mozzarella\" sandwiches and Peking duck wraps.</p> <p>Metcalfe admits he has little patience for the money side of the business - he jokes that he suffers from ADHT, the hyperactivity disorder diagnosed among American children, and colleagues say he has a tendency to hang up during important conversations if he finds them boring.</p> <p>By 1998, the chain had 65 shops and the pair needed help - they were arguing, and struggling to control their rapidly growing empire. They recruited a former Pepsi executive, Andrew Rolfe, as chief executive. That freed Beecham, the more businesslike partner, to explore overseas expansion. For the past 18 months, he has been in New York, managing the firm's embryonic US operation.</p> <p>It is this transatlantic venture which has led to McDonald's involvement - the two men realised that if they wanted to take their concept to another country, they needed heavyweight backing. Metcalfe says: \"As a private company it's very difficult to set up abroad. We didn't know where to begin in New York - we ended up having all the equipment for the shop made here and shipped over.\"</p> <p>There were cultural problems - the company claimed it had great difficulty finding New Yorkers to work in the shop who were prepared to offer Pret's required level of friendliness. British staff had to be sent out to run the new outlet. Critics sniped that it would never take off, because Americans liked bespoke sandwiches prepared before their eyes. Against the odds, the shop, located just off Wall Street, does seem to be working.</p> <p>Another seven are planned in Manhattan this year. McDonald's will help, by providing contacts, a food distribution network and expertise in finding sites. Further ahead, Pret is eyeing Asia - Hong Kong and Tokyo will be targeted. The risk is that as the company expands, it will lose its upmarket tag. At present, it boasts the Queen among its customers - Buckingham Palace sends out for \u00a31,000 of sandwiches a week from Pret in Piccadilly. But association with McDonald's could deter such glamorous custom.</p> <p>Metcalfe admits that the reaction to the deal among his staff was initially hostile: \"We had to explain carefully what we were doing. If I'd stood up, announced we'd sold 51% to McDonald's and said goodbye and thank-you, it would have been a disaster.\"</p> <p>Instead, he emphasised the deal's limits: \"We'll still be in charge - we'll have the majority of the shares. Pret will continue what it does and McDonalds will continue what it does.\"</p> <p>That is not quite the way McDonald's sees it. A spokesman says: \"We have an option to increase our investment and to fully acquire them over time.\"</p> <p>There are bound to be clashes. Pret is proud of its ethical record - it was among the first to ban genetically modified food, and it claims to have eliminated all trace of \"mass production techniques\". The latest Pret fad is organic milk.</p> <p>This friendship with the environmental lobby could be wrecked by its link with McDonald's. Green activists are deeply suspicious about the way it sources meat. Those on the left are similarly sceptical, complaining of horror stories about staff pay and conditions.</p> <p>So is there a risk that the next time May Day marchers trash a branch of McDonald's they will train their sights on Pret? \"Perhaps,\" says Metcalfe. \"But the proof is in the pudding. We've developed a relationship of trust with our customers over many years. People may have differences with McDonald's about their supply of food but those issues don't apply to Pret.\"</p> <p>Metcalfe maintains that Pret will prosper as long as it maintains its attention to detail - the mixture for oat and fruit slices, for example, must be stirred with a four-foot oar to maintain \"texture and taste\". Staff are persuaded to be nice with an offer of a 70p-an-hour bonus, given to all those who are sufficiently charming during weekly visits by a mystery shopper.</p> <p>One City analyst reckons Pret is worth around \u00a375m, which means McDonald's has stumped up about \u00a325m for its stake - small fry, by the standards of the Illinois-based empire. Metcalfe and Beecham, who sold shares in the deal, maintain that their personal wealth is easily exaggerated. \"Rich lists\" estimate their wealth at between \u00a330m and \u00a340m each.</p> <p>Metcalfe says: \"The deal wasn't about money - we could have sold the shares for much more to other buyers, but they wouldn't have provided the support we need.\"</p> <p>McDonald's and Pret a Manger make an odd couple. But the logic, at least for the US company, is clear. Britons spend three times as much on sandwiches as on burgers - a third of us eat a sarnie every day.</p> <p>But for Pret, a company whose success has always been finely balanced on the line between affordability and luxury, environmental awareness and pre-packaged convenience, the deal could yet prove dangerous: the shadow cast by the golden arches is a notoriously long and murky one. Pret's best hope may be that the super-pressurised throngs of young professionals on which it has built its prosperity will simply not have enough time to stop and think about it.</p> <p><b>'The tuna wrap tasted like chamois leather but pudding was great'</b><br><b>Matthew Fort</b></p> <p>\"Pret creates handmade, natural food, avoiding the obscure chemicals, additives and preservatives common to so much 'prepared' and 'fast' food on the market today,\" declares the rubric plastered all over Pret a Manger outlets, packaging, bags and walls. What could such an ethically righteous organisation have in common with McDonald's? Well, perhaps more than you might think.</p> <p>Perhaps Pret a Manger customers represent the McDonald's customer 10 years down the line, grown health conscious and gastronomically sophisticated and a slave to the desk. The naff colours, melamine and spotty youths serving up the burgers, buns and bags have given way to the shiny metallic surfaces, high,small, round tables with bar stools and spotty youths serving up the lattes, cappuccinos and, oh yes, the bags made of the same recycled paper against a background blur of discreet funk.</p> <p>Of course the basic food products are widely, if not wildly, different. In place of the queue 'n' serve Big Mac, Chicken McNuggets, beanburger and milk shakes, Pret a Manger brings us the self-service 'n' queue BLT, chicken jalfrezi wrap, sushi and a blackberry, pear, banana and orange drink for the fanatically figure conscious.</p> <p>I was not in a particularly figure-conscious mood when I stormed into the Pret a Manger in Bristol, (complete with bespectacled man reading the Guardian at a table in the window), and slunk out with a vegetarian sushi, a chicken club sandwich, a tuna Ni\u00e7oise wrap, a chocolate passion pot and a double-strength latte by way of quality control, and discovered that Pret a Manger had more in common with McDonald's than I had thought possible.</p> <p>Vegetarian sushi is a bizarre concept. Vegetables have neither the neutrality nor the texture of raw fish. Their cause was not aided by dry and solid rice wrapped up in double strength nori with the chewability of damp cardboard. Whoever had handmade these sushi had also gone rather light on the wasabi and the slices of pickled ginger were withered.</p> <p>The tuna Ni\u00e7oise wrap was another grazing compound, owing more to fashion than good taste. It tasted like fish paste wrapped in chamois leather, with a bit of floppy Webb's wonder lettuce, tomato, raw french beans and slices of hard-boiled egg. Any connection with a real salad Ni\u00e7oise was entirely notional.</p> <p>The chicken club sandwich was rather good; a wholesome (well, the bread was granary), properly balanced meal in a mouthful. True, most of the flavour came by way of the excellent mayonnaise, but at least there was flavour.</p> <p>For pudding I had the chocolate pot, for which I have nothing but praise, almost. It is quite solid and very smooth, with the consistency of ready mixed Polyfilla. The quality and intensity of the chocolate is carefully judged to give some measure of pleasure to the chocolate connoisseur without frightening off the Dairy Milk devotee.</p> <p>The latte was not a success. Bitterness should not be confused with strength; that's what you get from over-roasting substandard arabica beans.</p> <p>Still, for just over a tenner, you can't really complain. Can you?</p> <p><b> Score: 7/20 </b></p>",

While Beecham holds the purse-strings, Metcalfe looks after the food - he spends Thursday afternoon with a recipe committee, sampling different ideas. He goes for exotic mixtures, once remarking: \"The English respond to strong tastes - look at curry.\" Recent additions include Scotch beef with crispy onions, \"More than mozzarella\" sandwiches and Peking duck wraps. Metcalfe admits he has little patience for the money side of the business - he jokes that he suffers from ADHT, the hyperactivity disorder diagnosed among American children, and colleagues say he has a tendency to hang up during important conversations if he finds them boring. By 1998, the chain had 65 shops and the pair needed help - they were arguing, and struggling to control their rapidly growing empire. They recruited a former Pepsi executive, Andrew Rolfe, as chief executive. That freed Beecham, the more businesslike partner, to explore overseas expansion. For the past 18 months, he has been in New York, managing the firm's embryonic US operation. It is this transatlantic venture which has led to McDonald's involvement - the two men realised that if they wanted to take their concept to another country, they needed heavyweight backing. Metcalfe says: \"As a private company it's very difficult to set up abroad. We didn't know where to begin in New York - we ended up having all the equipment for the shop made here and shipped over.\" There were cultural problems - the company claimed it had great difficulty finding New Yorkers to work in the shop who were prepared to offer Pret's required level of friendliness. British staff had to be sent out to run the new outlet. Critics sniped that it would never take off, because Americans liked bespoke sandwiches prepared before their eyes. Against the odds, the shop, located just off Wall Street, does seem to be working. Another seven are planned in Manhattan this year. McDonald's will help, by providing contacts, a food distribution network and expertise in finding sites. Further ahead, Pret is eyeing Asia - Hong Kong and Tokyo will be targeted. The risk is that as the company expands, it will lose its upmarket tag. At present, it boasts the Queen among its customers - Buckingham Palace sends out for \u00a31,000 of sandwiches a week from Pret in Piccadilly. But association with McDonald's could deter such glamorous custom. Metcalfe admits that the reaction to the deal among his staff was initially hostile: \"We had to explain carefully what we were doing. If I'd stood up, announced we'd sold 51% to McDonald's and said goodbye and thank-you, it would have been a disaster.\" Instead, he emphasised the deal's limits: \"We'll still be in charge - we'll have the majority of the shares. Pret will continue what it does and McDonalds will continue what it does.\" That is not quite the way McDonald's sees it. A spokesman says: \"We have an option to increase our investment and to fully acquire them over time.\" There are bound to be clashes. Pret is proud of its ethical record - it was among the first to ban genetically modified food, and it claims to have eliminated all trace of \"mass production techniques\". The latest Pret fad is organic milk. This friendship with the environmental lobby could be wrecked by its link with McDonald's. Green activists are deeply suspicious about the way it sources meat. Those on the left are similarly sceptical, complaining of horror stories about staff pay and conditions. So is there a risk that the next time May Day marchers trash a branch of McDonald's they will train their sights on Pret? \"Perhaps,\" says Metcalfe. \"But the proof is in the pudding. We've developed a relationship of trust with our customers over many years. People may have differences with McDonald's about their supply of food but those issues don't apply to Pret.\" Metcalfe maintains that Pret will prosper as long as it maintains its attention to detail - the mixture for oat and fruit slices, for example, must be stirred with a four-foot oar to maintain \"texture and taste\". Staff are persuaded to be nice with an offer of a 70p-an-hour bonus, given to all those who are sufficiently charming during weekly visits by a mystery shopper. One City analyst reckons Pret is worth around \u00a375m, which means McDonald's has stumped up about \u00a325m for its stake - small fry, by the standards of the Illinois-based empire. Metcalfe and Beecham, who sold shares in the deal, maintain that their personal wealth is easily exaggerated. \"Rich lists\" estimate their wealth at between \u00a330m and \u00a340m each. Metcalfe says: \"The deal wasn't about money - we could have sold the shares for much more to other buyers, but they wouldn't have provided the support we need.\" McDonald's and Pret a Manger make an odd couple. But the logic, at least for the US company, is clear. Britons spend three times as much on sandwiches as on burgers - a third of us eat a sarnie every day. But for Pret, a company whose success has always been finely balanced on the line between affordability and luxury, environmental awareness and pre-packaged convenience, the deal could yet prove dangerous: the shadow cast by the golden arches is a notoriously long and murky one. Pret's best hope may be that the super-pressurised throngs of young professionals on which it has built its prosperity will simply not have enough time to stop and think about it. 'The tuna wrap tasted like chamois leather but pudding was great' Matthew Fort \"Pret creates handmade, natural food, avoiding the obscure chemicals, additives and preservatives common to so much 'prepared' and 'fast' food on the market today,\" declares the rubric plastered all over Pret a Manger outlets, packaging, bags and walls. What could such an ethically righteous organisation have in common with McDonald's? Well, perhaps more than you might think. Perhaps Pret a Manger customers represent the McDonald's customer 10 years down the line, grown health conscious and gastronomically sophisticated and a slave to the desk. The naff colours, melamine and spotty youths serving up the burgers, buns and bags have given way to the shiny metallic surfaces, high,small, round tables with bar stools and spotty youths serving up the lattes, cappuccinos and, oh yes, the bags made of the same recycled paper against a background blur of discreet funk. Of course the basic food products are widely, if not wildly, different. In place of the queue 'n' serve Big Mac, Chicken McNuggets, beanburger and milk shakes, Pret a Manger brings us the self-service 'n' queue BLT, chicken jalfrezi wrap, sushi and a blackberry, pear, banana and orange drink for the fanatically figure conscious. I was not in a particularly figure-conscious mood when I stormed into the Pret a Manger in Bristol, (complete with bespectacled man reading the Guardian at a table in the window), and slunk out with a vegetarian sushi, a chicken club sandwich, a tuna Ni\u00e7oise wrap, a chocolate passion pot and a double-strength latte by way of quality control, and discovered that Pret a Manger had more in common with McDonald's than I had thought possible. Vegetarian sushi is a bizarre concept. Vegetables have neither the neutrality nor the texture of raw fish. Their cause was not aided by dry and solid rice wrapped up in double strength nori with the chewability of damp cardboard. Whoever had handmade these sushi had also gone rather light on the wasabi and the slices of pickled ginger were withered. The tuna Ni\u00e7oise wrap was another grazing compound, owing more to fashion than good taste. It tasted like fish paste wrapped in chamois leather, with a bit of floppy Webb's wonder lettuce, tomato, raw french beans and slices of hard-boiled egg. Any connection with a real salad Ni\u00e7oise was entirely notional. The chicken club sandwich was rather good; a wholesome (well, the bread was granary), properly balanced meal in a mouthful. True, most of the flavour came by way of the excellent mayonnaise, but at least there was flavour. For pudding I had the chocolate pot, for which I have nothing but praise, almost. It is quite solid and very smooth, with the consistency of ready mixed Polyfilla. The quality and intensity of the chocolate is carefully judged to give some measure of pleasure to the chocolate connoisseur without frightening off the Dairy Milk devotee. The latte was not a success. Bitterness should not be confused with strength; that's what you get from over-roasting substandard arabica beans. Still, for just over a tenner, you can't really complain. Can you? Score: 7/20",

      "body": "<p>For a moment yesterday morning it seemed that our glorious takeover panel had finally wheezed into action, telling Lloyds TSB bank that it is unfair to leave an open-ended threat of hostile takeover hanging over its smaller, weaker rival Abbey National, and instructing the undeclared predator to put up or shut up. </p> <p>But it appears that the panel is still out to lunch on this particular three-pronged \u00a320bn phoney bid, now on day 89. </p> <p>Instead of an unfettered offer from Lloyds for Abbey, which shareholders could compare with Abbey's own plans to merge with Bank of Scotland (on which we still lack any real detail) within the confines of the traditional City takeover timetable, we have another piece of ultra-cunning from the Lloyds corporate finance team: an offer document that looks and feels like a real offer document, but which carries enough pre-conditions to ensure it is actually nothing more than a marketing pitch. It also includes Lloyds' profits for 2000, released early, under the unusual banner of \"business as unusual operating profit\". </p> <p>Chief executive Peter Ellwood and his team will now spend February formally selling their case for a takeover to Abbey's major shareholders, while at the same time retaining the right to bin the whole idea if the proposal is either packed off to the competition commission or (don't laugh) if the Abbey board fail to recommend the terms. Recommendation from Abbey would seem a tad unlikely in the short term, especially when Lloyds is proposing to \"co-locate\" 600 of Abbey's 722-strong branch network. </p> <p>It is a strange phrase, \"co-locate\". Lloyds disputes the suggestion but for customers and for the staff working in these 600 branches, and the 300 others which will go as the Lloyds integration with TSB grinds on, the phrase will simply mean \"shut\". </p> <p><strong> On ice </strong><br> </p> <p> If it weren't so serious, the Iceland saga could be amusing. Yesterday we had the unedifying spectacle of \"friends\" of the men who have overseen the shocking business of the food group's fall from grace fighting like ferrets in a sack. </p> <p>\"It was Stuart Rose's fault,\" say those close to the new Iceland boss, Bill Grimsey. \"He just didn't do the job. Barely showed up on the premises, etc, etc.\" </p> <p>\"Complete nonsense,\" says the Rose faction. \"Everything was in order when our man quit.\" </p> <p>But it is a serious business. First there is the substantial matter of Malcolm Walker's \u00a313.5m share sale. Did he know that Iceland's sales were collapsing and that the share price would surely follow suit? Groups like Iceland have daily sales updates, and it must have been apparent that they were falling way short of expectations. </p> <p>Then there is the matter of the lack of progress in integrating the Booker Cash &amp; Carry business. </p> <p>Mr Walker maintains that he was getting ready to step down, that problems weren't apparent and that the board ratified the deal. But he held an analysts' meeting just before he sold his shares, and even a chairman preparing to step down should surely have checked the figures and the progress of the merger before meeting the City's finest? But there was no hint then of the problems just around the corner. </p> <p>And the old Iceland guard cannot lay the blame for that on Mr Rose, who was out of the door six weeks earlier. </p> <p>The FSA is now investigating, and if that is the case, it is a dreadful indictment of the way Iceland was being run. </p> <p>Then, of course, there is Mr Rose, so highly regarded in the City that Arcadia's shares have tripled from 45p since the day he was appointed purely on his potential. </p> <p>Yesterday, as doubts suddenly emerged about his golden touch, Arcadia's shares also recoiled. </p> <p>Finally, there is Mr Grimsey. </p> <p>He did a kitchen sink job at Iceland yesterday, lumping in a shedload of provisions, bad news and dire warnings to reduce expectations and create a low base from which to make progress. </p> <p>Analysts like Mr Grimsey. They saw what he did at Wickes and he is now regarded as one of retailing's elite. </p> <p>The shares are probably now a buy. </p> <p><strong> E-tail saga </strong><br> </p> <p> The Letsbuyit.com saga goes from bad to worse. Yesterday's job cuts were a last ditch effort to inject some life into the e-tailer and stop it haemorrhaging cash. </p> <p>We have all been entertained by the size and colour of Letsbuyit's would-be saviour, German hacker Kim Schmitz and his Kimble organisation. But shareholders and many of those losing their jobs still do not understand quite why the firm has imploded so spectacularly. </p> <p><strong>Anyone with the inside story should feel free to contact us through </strong><a href=\"mailto:city@theguardian.com.\">city@theguardian.com.</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "For a moment yesterday morning it seemed that our glorious takeover panel had finally wheezed into action, telling Lloyds TSB bank that it is unfair to leave an open-ended threat of hostile takeover hanging over its smaller, weaker rival Abbey National, and instructing the undeclared predator to put up or shut up. But it appears that the panel is still out to lunch on this particular three-pronged \u00a320bn phoney bid, now on day 89. Instead of an unfettered offer from Lloyds for Abbey, which shareholders could compare with Abbey's own plans to merge with Bank of Scotland (on which we still lack any real detail) within the confines of the traditional City takeover timetable, we have another piece of ultra-cunning from the Lloyds corporate finance team: an offer document that looks and feels like a real offer document, but which carries enough pre-conditions to ensure it is actually nothing more than a marketing pitch. It also includes Lloyds' profits for 2000, released early, under the unusual banner of \"business as unusual operating profit\". Chief executive Peter Ellwood and his team will now spend February formally selling their case for a takeover to Abbey's major shareholders, while at the same time retaining the right to bin the whole idea if the proposal is either packed off to the competition commission or (don't laugh) if the Abbey board fail to recommend the terms. Recommendation from Abbey would seem a tad unlikely in the short term, especially when Lloyds is proposing to \"co-locate\" 600 of Abbey's 722-strong branch network. It is a strange phrase, \"co-locate\". Lloyds disputes the suggestion but for customers and for the staff working in these 600 branches, and the 300 others which will go as the Lloyds integration with TSB grinds on, the phrase will simply mean \"shut\". On ice If it weren't so serious, the Iceland saga could be amusing. Yesterday we had the unedifying spectacle of \"friends\" of the men who have overseen the shocking business of the food group's fall from grace fighting like ferrets in a sack. \"It was Stuart Rose's fault,\" say those close to the new Iceland boss, Bill Grimsey. \"He just didn't do the job. Barely showed up on the premises, etc, etc.\" \"Complete nonsense,\" says the Rose faction. \"Everything was in order when our man quit.\" But it is a serious business. First there is the substantial matter of Malcolm Walker's \u00a313.5m share sale. Did he know that Iceland's sales were collapsing and that the share price would surely follow suit? Groups like Iceland have daily sales updates, and it must have been apparent that they were falling way short of expectations. Then there is the matter of the lack of progress in integrating the Booker Cash &amp; Carry business. Mr Walker maintains that he was getting ready to step down, that problems weren't apparent and that the board ratified the deal. But he held an analysts' meeting just before he sold his shares, and even a chairman preparing to step down should surely have checked the figures and the progress of the merger before meeting the City's finest? But there was no hint then of the problems just around the corner. And the old Iceland guard cannot lay the blame for that on Mr Rose, who was out of the door six weeks earlier. The FSA is now investigating, and if that is the case, it is a dreadful indictment of the way Iceland was being run. Then, of course, there is Mr Rose, so highly regarded in the City that Arcadia's shares have tripled from 45p since the day he was appointed purely on his potential. Yesterday, as doubts suddenly emerged about his golden touch, Arcadia's shares also recoiled. Finally, there is Mr Grimsey. He did a kitchen sink job at Iceland yesterday, lumping in a shedload of provisions, bad news and dire warnings to reduce expectations and create a low base from which to make progress. Analysts like Mr Grimsey. They saw what he did at Wickes and he is now regarded as one of retailing's elite. The shares are probably now a buy. E-tail saga The Letsbuyit.com saga goes from bad to worse. Yesterday's job cuts were a last ditch effort to inject some life into the e-tailer and stop it haemorrhaging cash. We have all been entertained by the size and colour of Letsbuyit's would-be saviour, German hacker Kim Schmitz and his Kimble organisation. But shareholders and many of those losing their jobs still do not understand quite why the firm has imploded so spectacularly.

Mr Ashcroft's success was assured after a Senate vetting panel voted by 10-8 to allow his confirmation to go before the whole chamber. A single Democrat, Russell Feingold, joined the nine Republicans on the Senate judiciary committee to cast the deciding vote, saying that his reluctant support for the nomination was \"an olive branch\" to the new administration, not \"a white flag\".

Democratic leaders were still hoping that as many as 40 senators would vote against Mr Ashcroft to issue a warning that his actions would be subjected to close scrutiny. Mr Ashcroft was the only Bush nominee to face serious opposition in the Senate.

The Lemmons from Cambridge and The Lunns from Harrogate both wanted better family lives, and had chosen Covey's tome, The Seven Habits Of Highly Effective Families, with which to improve their lives. It had worked for Covey himself, after all. He had a big house in a nice bit of Utah, the nearest neighbours some majestic pine trees and a rather impressive mountain range. He also had nine children and 33 grandchildren. This suggested that he was far too effective for his own good, so it's probably just as well that he'd sold 15 million books worldwide, otherwise the Covey clan would have been living in the trailer park next to the Osmonds. </p> <p>Family life, said Covey, was like a high wire trapeze act with no safety net, though one imagines that any circus metaphor will do (lion taming, juggling chainsaws, Papa Lazarou's freak show). </p> <p>Over in Cambridge, for example, it was like juggling lions on a high wire. Mum Tracy wanted daughter Sarah and son Andrew to get along with her, with each other, and with her boyfriend Richard. Being a teenager who desperately wanted her bellybutton pierced, Sarah kept shouting and stropping out of the room, unable to get along with anyone, while Richard looked like Roy from The Cops. Not a good start. Up in Harrogate, mum Julie Lunn was sick of being the bad guy while all her children adored husband Ian. Nikki, their daughter, found Julie too controlling. </p> <p>From a rocking chair in Utah, Covey advised them all to open emotional bank accounts into which deposits (\"Thank you for making me dinner\") could be made. Unfortunately, the Lunns and the Lemmons seemed to be over their overdraft limits from the off. </p> <p>Despite Julie and Tracy's willingness - Julie even had a flipchart - Sarah continued to strop and Julie's children thanked dad for his loveliness while ignoring their (admittedly slightly uptight) mother's efforts. Covey's advice of \"hitting the pause button\" and \"having meaningful one-on-one time with each of the family\" was akin to sticking an Elastoplast over a gunshot wound when their problems could have been resolved by being much more direct. To wit, Sarah Lemmon should have been locked in a cupboard until she was 25. But did Covey say that? Nope. He was far too busy uttering banalities like, \"We must never cease in striving and, at the end of all our striving, we will be where we began and see the place for the first time.\" Translation: \"Congratulations. You have just wasted \u00a312.99 on a cheesy self-help manual. You could have had a bottle of vodka for that.\" </p> <p>Busy with that and counting his money. And his grandkids. </p> <p><strong> Confidence Lab </strong> (BBC2) is really rather uplifting - and not just because of Dawn French. The latest subjects of this genuinely thoughtful programme were Linda, whose weight and preoccupation with it got her down, and John, a Glaswegian whose lack of stature drove him to aggression and unnecessary kilt wearing. Curiously, his Glaswegianness - a bigger problem in my book - gave him no trouble at all. Being a bit of a shortarse myself, I envied John's height-related self-consciousness - his drove him to the gym, mine drives me to Jaffa Cakes - but once he burst into tears, I envied him no longer. </p> <p>John followed rules of society that he didn't really believe (men shouldn't cry), felt exposed (as well he might in that nasty vest) and didn't like cuddles. Well, I wept like a baby when Adric died in Dr Who, I don't wear vests and I love cuddles. Proof, methinks, that you don't know what you've got until you witness someone else suffering. </p> <p>With the help of Sandra, Roy and Ros (her again), both John and Linda got to grips with their problems and were in high spirits at the group reunion, as well you might be if you'd aired your neuroses at the luxurious Babbington Hall.

One found that 15% of users identified psychotic symptoms or irrational feelings of persecution. Other reports suggested the drug could induce psychosis in people with no history of severe mental illness.</p> <p>Those with mental illness - living in the community, and as likely as anybody else to get hold of the drug - were even more at risk. \"People with major mental illnesses such as schizophrenia are especially vulnerable, in that cannabis generally provokes relapses and aggravates existing symptoms,\" Dr Johns said.</p> <p>\"Health workers need to recognise, and respond to, the adverse effects of cannabis on mental health.\"</p> <p>Researchers are testing cannabis as a potential medicinal drug - there are claims that it can quell nausea during chemotherapy, relieve glaucoma and stifle the pain of multiple sclerosis - but smoking marijuana also imposes a price.</p> <p>Last year US researchers showed that squirrel monkeys found the drug addictive, and a Boston team reported that, an hour after inhaling, the risk of heart attack increased fivefold.</p> <p>Heather Ashton, of the University of Newcastle, reports in the same journal that besides producing severe anxiety, panic, paranoia and psychosis in high doses, cannabis impaired memory and concentration.</p> <p>There could be heart problems for people with pre-existing cardiac disease, and the drug also suppressed the immune system. Cannabis cigarettes could be as addictive as nicotine, and the tars from cannabis cigarettes contained higher levels of some cancer-causing chemicals than tobacco.</p> <p>Smoking three or four reefers a day produced the same risk of bronchitis or emphysema as 20 or more cigarettes.</p> <p>Chronic use might also cause complications in pregnancy and childbirth.</p>",

Andrew Johns of the Institute of Psychiatry at the Maudsley hospital in south London surveyed a number of recent studies. One found that 15% of users identified psychotic symptoms or irrational feelings of persecution. Other reports suggested the drug could induce psychosis in people with no history of severe mental illness. Those with mental illness - living in the community, and as likely as anybody else to get hold of the drug - were even more at risk. \"People with major mental illnesses such as schizophrenia are especially vulnerable, in that cannabis generally provokes relapses and aggravates existing symptoms,\" Dr Johns said. \"Health workers need to recognise, and respond to, the adverse effects of cannabis on mental health.\" Researchers are testing cannabis as a potential medicinal drug - there are claims that it can quell nausea during chemotherapy, relieve glaucoma and stifle the pain of multiple sclerosis - but smoking marijuana also imposes a price. Last year US researchers showed that squirrel monkeys found the drug addictive, and a Boston team reported that, an hour after inhaling, the risk of heart attack increased fivefold. Heather Ashton, of the University of Newcastle, reports in the same journal that besides producing severe anxiety, panic, paranoia and psychosis in high doses, cannabis impaired memory and concentration. There could be heart problems for people with pre-existing cardiac disease, and the drug also suppressed the immune system. Cannabis cigarettes could be as addictive as nicotine, and the tars from cannabis cigarettes contained higher levels of some cancer-causing chemicals than tobacco. Smoking three or four reefers a day produced the same risk of bronchitis or emphysema as 20 or more cigarettes. Chronic use might also cause complications in pregnancy and childbirth.",

Only camels seem at home, plodding among the shimmering salt flats. </p> <p>And these are not the best of times. Last Friday the earthquake that levelled much of the Indian state of Gujarat left seven dead in Dinara, including an eight-month-old baby. As the tremors subsided, the villagers shook themselves and waited for help to arrive. </p> <p>Yesterday - thirsty and desperate - they were still waiting. \"We have had no water for four or five days. All of our wells have been destroyed. We have been forced to drink salt water,\" villager Omar Sama said. \"We are not getting grain. Nobody has come to help us.\" </p> <p>The village teacher, Sama Mirmama, added: \"We are looking for bread. People living here believe that God is angry with us.\" </p> <p>Aid has cascaded into Bhuj, the historic town close to the epicentre of last week's quake, but none of it has yet reached the remote and stricken interior 50 miles to the north. </p> <p>Here 32 isolated villages, including Dinara, have been flattened. At least 75 people have died - with the total death toll for the region, the Rann of Kutch, put at 1,000. And yet ours was the only vehicle to have reached Dinara, apart from a solitary relief truck that doled out only biscuits and sweets. We gave the villagers our chapattis. It was not much of a contribution. </p> <p>Almost all the big structures in the village have collapsed. But the traditional conical mud huts, made from cow dung and roofed with babul branches and grass, have survived. The rural people who live in this barren earthquake-prone desert have benefited from their ancestors' wisdom. </p> <p>\"We have had no relief. Maybe we have not received anything because we are Harijans [untouchables],\" Mr Sama mused. </p> <p>Dinara's prospects in the coming months are poor. The village women have traditionally made a decent living from selling exquisitely embroidered clothes to tourists. </p> <p>There were also few signs of relief in Khavda, five miles to the south. The town has been turned to rubble, with some 90% of buildings destroyed, suggesting that the quake's arc of destruction has, if anything, been underestimated. </p> <p>At Ishmail Khalifa's barber's shop, the clock ticked on and the poster of Bombay was still on the wall. But the barber's chair was full of jagged bricks. </p> <p>\"There were three customers in my shop. Two were inside and one was outside. The customer Mukim, was having a shave when the earthquake arrived. He rushed outside and he died,\" Mr Khalifa explained. </p> <p>\"Seven people were killed here, including two two-year-old boys,\" said Khavda's feudal chief, Lataji Thackar. \"The earthquake was like a bomb. There was shaking everywhere. All of my six houses have been destroyed. But my family is safe.\" </p> <p>The town's 3,000 homeless residents have given up waiting for aid, choosing instead to build their own tents in the grounds of Khavda's school. </p> <p>A medical team finally arrived yesterday and set up a field hospital. Within an hour of opening, it had treated 71 patients. Most were from remote villages like Dinara. Some had been hobbling round with untreated broken legs and arms since Friday. </p> <p>The earthquake has transformed the region in different ways. Locals say that a tributary of the Indus river, sealed by a previous earthquake, has started flowing again. </p> <p>The subterranean geology of the area has changed too. \"There are three streams of water suddenly. One is muddy, one is salt water and one is sweet,\" said Ajay Bora, who runs Bhuj's defunct three-star Prince hotel. </p> <p><strong>How you can help</strong> <br><a href=\"http://www.redcrossdonations.org.uk\">Red Cross appeal</a> or call 08705 125125 <br><a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/atwork/emerg/indiaearthquake.htm\">Oxfam</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/pressrels/270101.html\">Save the Children</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.unicef.org.uk/giving/donate/donform.asp?app=\" india\"\">Unicef</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.interaction.org/india00/index.html\">US organisations involved in the relief effort</a> </p> <p> <strong>Related articles</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/naturaldisasters/story/0,7369,430307,00.html\">29.01.2001: Hopes fade as toll rises to 20,000</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/naturaldisasters/story/0,7369,430302,00.html\">29.01.2001: 'In half a minute everyone was killed'</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/naturaldisasters/story/0,7369,430308,00.html\">29.01.2001: Leader - Lessons from past disasters go unheeded</a> </p> <p> <strong>Photo gallery</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/gall/0,8542,429420,00.html\">The disaster in pictures</a> </p> <p> <strong>Graphic</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/naturaldisasters/flash/0,7365,430599,00.html\">Interactive guide to the Indian earthquake</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/graphic/0,5812,428815,00.html\">Map of the disaster zone</a> </p> <p> <strong>Audio</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0129harding.ra\">Indian quake leaves devastation 'on an epic scale'</a><br>The relief effort has come too late for the victims of Friday's devastating earthquake, reports <strong> Luke Harding </strong> in Ahmedabad.

Only camels seem at home, plodding among the shimmering salt flats. And these are not the best of times. Last Friday the earthquake that levelled much of the Indian state of Gujarat left seven dead in Dinara, including an eight-month-old baby. As the tremors subsided, the villagers shook themselves and waited for help to arrive. Yesterday - thirsty and desperate - they were still waiting. \"We have had no water for four or five days. All of our wells have been destroyed. We have been forced to drink salt water,\" villager Omar Sama said. \"We are not getting grain. Nobody has come to help us.\" The village teacher, Sama Mirmama, added: \"We are looking for bread. People living here believe that God is angry with us.\" Aid has cascaded into Bhuj, the historic town close to the epicentre of last week's quake, but none of it has yet reached the remote and stricken interior 50 miles to the north. Here 32 isolated villages, including Dinara, have been flattened. At least 75 people have died - with the total death toll for the region, the Rann of Kutch, put at 1,000. And yet ours was the only vehicle to have reached Dinara, apart from a solitary relief truck that doled out only biscuits and sweets. We gave the villagers our chapattis. It was not much of a contribution. Almost all the big structures in the village have collapsed. But the traditional conical mud huts, made from cow dung and roofed with babul branches and grass, have survived. The rural people who live in this barren earthquake-prone desert have benefited from their ancestors' wisdom. \"We have had no relief. Maybe we have not received anything because we are Harijans [untouchables],\" Mr Sama mused. Dinara's prospects in the coming months are poor. The village women have traditionally made a decent living from selling exquisitely embroidered clothes to tourists. There were also few signs of relief in Khavda, five miles to the south. The town has been turned to rubble, with some 90% of buildings destroyed, suggesting that the quake's arc of destruction has, if anything, been underestimated. At Ishmail Khalifa's barber's shop, the clock ticked on and the poster of Bombay was still on the wall. But the barber's chair was full of jagged bricks. \"There were three customers in my shop. Two were inside and one was outside. The customer Mukim, was having a shave when the earthquake arrived. He rushed outside and he died,\" Mr Khalifa explained. \"Seven people were killed here, including two two-year-old boys,\" said Khavda's feudal chief, Lataji Thackar. \"The earthquake was like a bomb. There was shaking everywhere. All of my six houses have been destroyed. But my family is safe.\" The town's 3,000 homeless residents have given up waiting for aid, choosing instead to build their own tents in the grounds of Khavda's school. A medical team finally arrived yesterday and set up a field hospital. Within an hour of opening, it had treated 71 patients. Most were from remote villages like Dinara. Some had been hobbling round with untreated broken legs and arms since Friday. The earthquake has transformed the region in different ways. Locals say that a tributary of the Indus river, sealed by a previous earthquake, has started flowing again. The subterranean geology of the area has changed too. \"There are three streams of water suddenly. One is muddy, one is salt water and one is sweet,\" said Ajay Bora, who runs Bhuj's defunct three-star Prince hotel.

He was a rather wild youth, and his father, a policeman, is reported to have said: \"You'd better be either a policeman or a pilot.\" In fact, after attending Loughborough College and Nottingham University, he qualified as a civil engineer. Without any further objective in mind, he also became deadly with a shotgun, with an average (he wrote) of two rabbits with every three shots.</p> <p>Realising that the AAF was at that time an exclusive club, he then tried the RAF Volunteer Reserve, to receive a second rejection. He eventually managed to join the Territorial Army, but in 1939 war clouds were gathering, and he was called up into the RAFVR. To his delight, he managed to be selected for pilot training, and found himself at Marshall's School at Cambridge. At 23 he was older than most of the pupils, but he did well, and in summer 1940 he went to Hawarden in Cheshire to learn to fly the Spitfire. On his fourth flight he pranged (crashed), but in September he was commissioned and posted to 19 Squadron, and then to an AAF unit, 616 Squadron. Exhausted, the survivors of 616 were being rested and reorganised away from the battle at Kirton-in-Lindsey.</p> <p>Here, Johnnie put in as many hours on the \"Spit\" as he could, but he found his flying handicapped by a painful old rugby injury. He tried to fly with his left hand, but eventually had to report his difficulty. The instant reaction was \"Has this chap gone LMF?\" Lack of moral fibre was a heinous crime, but Johnnie soon convinced the authorities that he was exactly the opposite.</p> <p>An operation cured the problem, and from then on Johnson be came a deadly killing machine, not only the master of the Spitfire but also - unlike almost everyone else - a master of accurate deflection shooting, learned against agile rabbits.</p> <p>The only problem was that the great Battle of Britain was over, and \"Huns\" were hard to find. In February 1941, 616 became part of the Tangmere Wing, which a month later was given a new wing leader: Douglas Bader, the famed pilot who had lost both legs in a pre-war crash. Johnson soon became Bader's No 3 (\"Cocky\" Dundas was No 2), a marvellous position at the front of the wing, but frustrating in that No 3's job was to cover the leader, not to go off chasing enemies.</p> <p>By May 1941, Bader's wing was taking the offensive over France, and Johnson began to learn his trade in actual combat. A month later, 616 was badly \"bounced\" over Gravelines. Johnson found himself alone, and suddenly saw a Messerschmitt 109 in front of him. Unlike most RAF pilots, Johnson hit with his first burst. He saw the pilot bail out. From then on, there was no stopping him.

Recuperating in hospital from the riding accident, he found himself more and more engaged by a reading of the score of No\u00ebl Coward's Bitter Sweet. It was to change his life.</p> <p>Heneker went on to become the lyricist behind the 1960s musicals Half A Sixpence and Charlie Girl, and many other West End shows. Coward had sown the seeds for turning a regular soldier into a composer and lyricist who collaborated on some of the most popular - if critically reviled - shows on the postwar stage. What the stint in hospital provoked was a latent desire to compose light music.</p> <p>At first, it was just ditties for crooners. Then his appreciation of the scope of cabaret in, say, the art of Leslie \"Hutch\" Hutchinson in the 1940s lured Heneker behind the scenes. He became a close friend of the singer, and in turn Hutch recorded Heneker's first published number, There Goes My Dream, which reached number one in the song-sheet charts.</p> <p>Not that he had left the army in those prewar days, which, as the son of a general, he had joined in 1925. He was born in Southsea and educated at Wellington College and the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst. By 1948, however, he felt confident enough of his talent to resign his commission and set up as a musician.</p> <p>By then, many of his other songs had won recognition - The Thingummy Bob That's Going To Win The War may still be remembered. The West End's Embassy Club took Heneker to its heart. He became one of its favourite regular cocktail pianists and singers during the 1950s. He also found himself contributing songs and tunes to theatrical revues, notably Cockles And Champagne (Saville, 1954).</p> <p>His first big chance in West End musicals came at the same theatre four years later with Wolf Mankowitz's Expresso Bongo, in which Paul Scofield made his singing debut as a variety agent. With Monty Norman, Heneker wrote the songs for this satire on the sleazy Soho world of pop-music exploitation.</p> <p>Months later, Heneker shared with Norman and Julian More the triumphant adaptation into English of Marguerite Monnot's Par- isian musical Irma La Douce (Lyric), directed by Peter Brook, and shortly after that he and Norman provided the music and lyrics for another low-life Mankowitz musical, Make Me An Offer (Theatre Royal, Stratford), which transferred to the West End and won the Evening Standard prize for best musical of the season.</p> <p>Having participated in three consecutive London hits, Heneker was invited to go it alone on a musical adaptation of HG Wells's Kipps - Half-A-Sixpence (Cambridge, 1963), which brought Tommy Steele into the West End as the draper's apprentice. This won Heneker an Ivor Novello award, an entry in the Dictionary Of Quotations for his number Flash, Bang, Wallop, and the distinction of being the first British writer to have had two shows on Broadway, each running for more than 500 performances.</p> <p>Whether this was the peak of the ever-modest Heneker's musical career or the show Charlie Girl (Adelphi, 1965) is a moot point. The one brought him credit on both sides of the Atlantic as the sole composer; the other, which he co-wrote, was mauled by the critics but ran for more than five years, with Anna Neagle, Hy Hazell, Derek Nimmo and Joe Brown in charge of its simple, stately-home humour.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Heneker took sole charge of the music again for the jaunty 19th-century hunting satire, Jorrocks (New, now Albery, 1966), based on the novels of RS Surtees, though it was relatively short-lived. In 1969 came the even less inspiring, but more extravagantly-staged, Phil The Fluter (Palace), based on the life of the Irish composer Percy French, whose output included Toot On The Flute, Phil The Fluter's Ball and The Mountains Of Mourne. This offered five of French's songs to 10 of Heneker's tunes.</p> <p>If hardly any of Heneker's shows were memorable for his music or melodies, he remained one of the most agreeably versatile of composers and lyricists, ready to turn his hand to anything that came his way, and as a man who was easy for others to work with. Whether the show was romantic or realistic, satirical or sentimental, his songs served the occasion, and sometimes rose above it.</p> <p>Popkiss (Globe, 1972) was a musical version of Ben Travers's 1920s farce, Rookery Nook, for which Heneker and John Addison provided the right kind of period tap-dancing and soft-shoe numbers; and his tunes were rated one of the better things in The Biograph Girl (Phoenix, 1981).</p> <p>At the same theatre three years later, Peg (1984), based on the 1912 American tearjerker, Peg O' My Heart, about an Irish-American girl of unexpected fortune descending on snobbish English relatives, won few hearts except through Heneker's catchy tunes.</p> <p>He was twice married; first to Ellen Hope (dissolved) and later to Gwenol Satow.</p> <p>\u0095 David Heneker, songwriter, born March 31 1906; died January 30 2001</p>",

Months later, Heneker shared with Norman and Julian More the triumphant adaptation into English of Marguerite Monnot's Par- isian musical Irma La Douce (Lyric), directed by Peter Brook, and shortly after that he and Norman provided the music and lyrics for another low-life Mankowitz musical, Make Me An Offer (Theatre Royal, Stratford), which transferred to the West End and won the Evening Standard prize for best musical of the season. Having participated in three consecutive London hits, Heneker was invited to go it alone on a musical adaptation of HG Wells's Kipps - Half-A-Sixpence (Cambridge, 1963), which brought Tommy Steele into the West End as the draper's apprentice. This won Heneker an Ivor Novello award, an entry in the Dictionary Of Quotations for his number Flash, Bang, Wallop, and the distinction of being the first British writer to have had two shows on Broadway, each running for more than 500 performances. Whether this was the peak of the ever-modest Heneker's musical career or the show Charlie Girl (Adelphi, 1965) is a moot point. The one brought him credit on both sides of the Atlantic as the sole composer; the other, which he co-wrote, was mauled by the critics but ran for more than five years, with Anna Neagle, Hy Hazell, Derek Nimmo and Joe Brown in charge of its simple, stately-home humour. Meanwhile, Heneker took sole charge of the music again for the jaunty 19th-century hunting satire, Jorrocks (New, now Albery, 1966), based on the novels of RS Surtees, though it was relatively short-lived. In 1969 came the even less inspiring, but more extravagantly-staged, Phil The Fluter (Palace), based on the life of the Irish composer Percy French, whose output included Toot On The Flute, Phil The Fluter's Ball and The Mountains Of Mourne. This offered five of French's songs to 10 of Heneker's tunes. If hardly any of Heneker's shows were memorable for his music or melodies, he remained one of the most agreeably versatile of composers and lyricists, ready to turn his hand to anything that came his way, and as a man who was easy for others to work with. Whether the show was romantic or realistic, satirical or sentimental, his songs served the occasion, and sometimes rose above it. Popkiss (Globe, 1972) was a musical version of Ben Travers's 1920s farce, Rookery Nook, for which Heneker and John Addison provided the right kind of period tap-dancing and soft-shoe numbers; and his tunes were rated one of the better things in The Biograph Girl (Phoenix, 1981). At the same theatre three years later, Peg (1984), based on the 1912 American tearjerker, Peg O' My Heart, about an Irish-American girl of unexpected fortune descending on snobbish English relatives, won few hearts except through Heneker's catchy tunes. He was twice married; first to Ellen Hope (dissolved) and later to Gwenol Satow. \u0095 David Heneker, songwriter, born March 31 1906; died January 30 2001",

We saw him for what he was - the first servant of a government which is devoted to the maintenance and exercise of its own power and which has waged a steady campaign against the country's liberties.</p> <p>This seems an extraordinary statement to be making. We're talking about Jack Straw, for heaven's sake, the man whose modest performance during the last election campaign suggested an ideal steward for the Home Office. He seemed decent, balanced and slow to judge.</p> <p>But, just as we were lulled by the declarations of a freer, more open society in the Labour manifesto, so we were sedated by Straw's plodding mildness of manner. After four years of this government's rampage through civil liberties and its open attempt to control the media and the processes of devolution and constitutional reform, it is clear that we were guilty of a hopelessly misplaced trust.</p> <p>What is compelling about the government as a whole, and Straw in particular, is that their liberal self-image remains intact. When the members of the political cabinet met without civil servants on Tuesday to discuss election strategy, you can bet there wasn't the slightest doubt in any of their minds about their right to govern.</p> <p>There is an almost mystical conviction that they are not simply elected, they are chosen. And this has been betrayed in an arrogance that instantly recognised and felt at one with the civil service's culture of secrecy and control.</p> <p>Because it is Labour in power and not the Tories we have as an electorate somehow failed to register the seriousness of the successive attacks on the jury system, on our right to know, on privacy and on the assumption of innocence before guilt is proven.</p> <p>Imagine that a Conservative home secretary - say Michael Howard - had in a matter of months stifled opposition to a widely and justly criticised freedom of inform-ation bill by means of a parliamentary guillotine; introduced a measure to curb the right to trial by jury after a previous bill had twice been thrown out by the Lords; promoted a bill (now the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act - RIPA) which allows M15 and numerous other government agencies to inspect private emails without a court order; misled the public about police recruitment - in terms of both quantity and ethnic background; produced a steady rise in the prison population; introduced stringent new immigration controls; and enabled the police to take and retain DNA samples from suspects.</p> <p>If Howard had done all this, the media and the people would be up in arms. We might even have taken to the streets to call for his dismissal. But because the author of these attacks on our liberty is the softly spoken, plausibly hesitant Jack, we have let these things pass, all the while being distracted by Labour's rhythmic beat about hospitals and schools.</p> <p>The interesting part of the government's attacks on freedom is that it reveals an innate suspicion of the public. The measures to retain DNA samples, for instance, classify each one of us as a potential criminal, whether guilty of a crime or not. In the case of RIPA, everyone's privacy has been compromised by the black boxes which the government insists certain internet providers install.</p> <p>Whatever the lack of malign intent, we are all now the subjects of surveillance, the targets of a sophisticated apparatus of paranoia. Such a measure would be inconceivable in Europe and yet we have allowed it to happen with only a few voices raised against Straw, notably Richard Norton-Taylor's in this paper.</p> <p>The debate about the retention of DNA samples has been even more muted. Perhaps it is because liberty has mysteriously slipped from the premier league of issues, or maybe it is that the pace of legislation and the ever-changing agenda do not allow for proper ventilation of a subject.</p> <p>However, all you need to know about the police DNA data bank is that it doesn't simply contain an archive of unique markers, or super fingerprints. A DNA sample gives an entire profile of an individual, which as analysis of the human genome gathers pace, will yield more and more information about them. One can easily envisage a day when these data banks are used to put together lists of suspects simply on the basis of the information contained in their original sample.</p> <p>What I suppose I am describing is a basic instinct which drives so much of New Labour's policy making. It is fascinating how many of the self-avowed liberals and radicals have lost their convictions. In the constantly revived criminal justice (mode of trial) bill, which would limit the option to be tried by jury, it is fascinating to see such previous good liberals as Lord Lipsey and Baroness Jay, the Leader of the House of Lords, go in to bat for a proposal which was not only left out of Labour's manifesto but which is antithetical to all that they once stood for. What has happened to these people? Have their liberal values been skewed by hopes for and exercise of power, or is it simply a miraculously fast absorption rate from Whitehall?</p> <p>To examine these bills before they are modified by parliament is to see the absolutist character of the government in the raw. During the passage of the freedom of information bill, Straw had to be persuaded that the government's plan to maintain secrecy on environmental matters, such as GM crop trials, radiation risks and emission figures from polluting factories, contravened EU directives and a convention signed by every government in Europe, including Britain.</p> <p>The point is that this measure and the one that gives ministers a right to block the release of information, display Straw's innate hostility to open government and the democratic interests which Labour claimed to represent at the last election. It is, incidentally, a sour irony that Straw's department last year had the worst record for wrongly withholding information under the code of government practice, even though it was the Home Office that was charged with piloting the freedom of information bill.</p> <p>And let's not forget that while Straw was seeking to persuade parliament to accept his proposals on juries, he actually misled the house and the prime minister on the extent of support for the bill among judges, which was considerably less than he made out. This rates pretty high on the scale of mistakes, especially for a man who is so free with accusations about the lies of cabinet colleagues.</p> <p>There can now be only two interpretations of Straw's time at the Home Office. Either he has been held hostage by his civil servants or, as I suspect, he has cleverly masked his real nature. Either way, one cannot escape the conclusion that to entrust our freedoms to this man, indeed to this government, for a second time would be like committing an elderly relative into the care of Harold Shipman.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Imagine that a Conservative home secretary - say Michael Howard - had in a matter of months stifled opposition to a widely and justly criticised freedom of inform-ation bill by means of a parliamentary guillotine; introduced a measure to curb the right to trial by jury after a previous bill had twice been thrown out by the Lords; promoted a bill (now the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act - RIPA) which allows M15 and numerous other government agencies to inspect private emails without a court order; misled the public about police recruitment - in terms of both quantity and ethnic background; produced a steady rise in the prison population; introduced stringent new immigration controls; and enabled the police to take and retain DNA samples from suspects. If Howard had done all this, the media and the people would be up in arms. We might even have taken to the streets to call for his dismissal. But because the author of these attacks on our liberty is the softly spoken, plausibly hesitant Jack, we have let these things pass, all the while being distracted by Labour's rhythmic beat about hospitals and schools. The interesting part of the government's attacks on freedom is that it reveals an innate suspicion of the public. The measures to retain DNA samples, for instance, classify each one of us as a potential criminal, whether guilty of a crime or not. In the case of RIPA, everyone's privacy has been compromised by the black boxes which the government insists certain internet providers install. Whatever the lack of malign intent, we are all now the subjects of surveillance, the targets of a sophisticated apparatus of paranoia. Such a measure would be inconceivable in Europe and yet we have allowed it to happen with only a few voices raised against Straw, notably Richard Norton-Taylor's in this paper. The debate about the retention of DNA samples has been even more muted. Perhaps it is because liberty has mysteriously slipped from the premier league of issues, or maybe it is that the pace of legislation and the ever-changing agenda do not allow for proper ventilation of a subject. However, all you need to know about the police DNA data bank is that it doesn't simply contain an archive of unique markers, or super fingerprints. A DNA sample gives an entire profile of an individual, which as analysis of the human genome gathers pace, will yield more and more information about them. One can easily envisage a day when these data banks are used to put together lists of suspects simply on the basis of the information contained in their original sample. What I suppose I am describing is a basic instinct which drives so much of New Labour's policy making. It is fascinating how many of the self-avowed liberals and radicals have lost their convictions. In the constantly revived criminal justice (mode of trial) bill, which would limit the option to be tried by jury, it is fascinating to see such previous good liberals as Lord Lipsey and Baroness Jay, the Leader of the House of Lords, go in to bat for a proposal which was not only left out of Labour's manifesto but which is antithetical to all that they once stood for. What has happened to these people? Have their liberal values been skewed by hopes for and exercise of power, or is it simply a miraculously fast absorption rate from Whitehall? To examine these bills before they are modified by parliament is to see the absolutist character of the government in the raw. During the passage of the freedom of information bill, Straw had to be persuaded that the government's plan to maintain secrecy on environmental matters, such as GM crop trials, radiation risks and emission figures from polluting factories, contravened EU directives and a convention signed by every government in Europe, including Britain. The point is that this measure and the one that gives ministers a right to block the release of information, display Straw's innate hostility to open government and the democratic interests which Labour claimed to represent at the last election. It is, incidentally, a sour irony that Straw's department last year had the worst record for wrongly withholding information under the code of government practice, even though it was the Home Office that was charged with piloting the freedom of information bill. And let's not forget that while Straw was seeking to persuade parliament to accept his proposals on juries, he actually misled the house and the prime minister on the extent of support for the bill among judges, which was considerably less than he made out. This rates pretty high on the scale of mistakes, especially for a man who is so free with accusations about the lies of cabinet colleagues. There can now be only two interpretations of Straw's time at the Home Office. Either he has been held hostage by his civil servants or, as I suspect, he has cleverly masked his real nature. Either way, one cannot escape the conclusion that to entrust our freedoms to this man, indeed to this government, for a second time would be like committing an elderly relative into the care of Harold Shipman. comment@theguardian.com",

      "bodyText": "With Gordon Brown presiding over a growing surplus in the vaults of the Treasury, it might seem a bit rich for industrialised nations such as the UK to be contemplating tough action against offshore financial centres, which are themselves seeking to secure their tax bases. For all the talk of footloose capital heading for low tax countries, the taxman's cut of world income is larger than it has ever been. But globalisation, accelerated by the internet, is exposing serious flaws in the world's tax system. Companies and rich individuals can benefit from high quality public services in high tax countries while paying taxes in low tax jurisdictions. The industrialised countries represented by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) are concerned that without pre-emptive action they will not be able to continue funding schools, hospitals and the police. The OECD is threatening sanctions against offshore financial centres unless they make a public commitment to lift the veil of secrecy over their banking systems by the end of July and then implement reforms by the end of 2005. While the OECD says that it is not in the business of forcing countries to raise tax rates - in general it favours low tax rates on a wide base - it does want offshore centres to end unfair practices which exist solely to attract capital from non-residents and have no real economic value.

      "body": "<p>Elvis is alive! I kid you not. It sounds bizarre, but this is not another case of a deluded fan spotting him in their local supermarket. Elvis has been brought to life on the web, and anyone can chat with him. </p> <p>If you are interested in exploring this virtual miracle further, simply log on to <a href=\"http://elvis.alicebot.com\" target=\"_new\">his site</a>, where you can easily exchange text messages with the king of rock and roll. There is even a link to a virtual juke box where you can play his most famous hits, including Jailhouse Rock and All Shook Up. </p> <p>So what's brought all this about, then? Well, to not put too fine a point on it, Elvis has been reincarnated as a talking robot (or chatbot, for short). He is one of a handful of artificial intelligence-based robots being developed by technology companies and amateur programmers. </p> <p>They are hoping to attract investment from e-commerce companies and, if everything goes to plan, Elvis and other cyber stars could soon become central to the development of the next wave of customer services on websites and mobile phones. </p> <p>The celebrity chatbots have been cleverly programmed to respond to questions based on replies the actual celebrity has given in published interviews and recordings. But the programmers have also added a few lines of their own to give the chatbots a contemporary edge. </p> <p>In an exclusive interview with Guardian Online, Elvis reveals he is a great fan of the Spice Girls. His all-time favourite song from his back catalogue is Suspicious Minds and he still has a passion for huge quantities of fast food. </p> <p>As well as Elvis, there is also an <a href=\"http://triumphpc.com/john-lennon/\" target=\"_new\">online John Lennon robot</a> who has been created by Triumph PC, a Washington DC-based technology company. Visitors who have spoken to the world's first cyber-Beatle say on the site that they generally find the initial conversations spooky but by the end are impressed by the virtual chatting experience. </p> <p>The Lennon robot told Online that Yoko Ono was always in his thoughts, that his rows with Paul had been talked up and - perhaps more controversially - that he had little time for Oasis, despite Noel and Liam Gallagher's admiration for his work. </p> <p>For some critics, the virtual cloning of celebrities for the sake of the advancement of e-commerce is disturbing. But Triumph PC's spokesman Richard Maltz says the Lennon chatbot is intended to pay tribute to the great singer/songwriter. </p> <p>\"In the US, we have a large indignation industry of people who are offended by anything and everything,\" he says. Instead, he points out that the technology could also play a valuable educational role by creating virtual historical characters such as Napoleon and Gandhi. </p> <p>But the main aim of Triumph's work, he says, is to make interactive media more engaging and reduce the complexity of websites. </p> <p>Probably one of the most sophisticated chatbots on the web is Alice. Alice is so good that, by comparison, Elvis can appear clumsy at times in his replies, and the Lennon robot often struggles when you ask him a question outside his experience with the Beatles. </p> <p>Alice is an award-winning open source chat robot. (Open source basically means the code that determines her responses can be added to and modified by other dedicated programmers working over the web.) </p> <p>Last year Alice won the highly respected Loebner Prize for being the most human-like computer - the next prize will be awarded later this year. Alice was lovingly created by Dr Richard Wallace, who has a team of about 300 amateur programmers helping to develop her. Alice is exceptionally brainy and can happily give you a definition of existentialism. She will even enter into basic metaphysical conversations with visitors to <a href=\"http://www.alicebot.org\">her site</a> - but has time for idle chit-chat, too. </p> <p>\"In many ways she is a fairly accurate reflection of my opinions, beliefs, ideas and jokes,\" says Wallace. \"But she makes no bones about the fact that she is a robot.\" </p> <p>About 6,000 people a month chat to Alice, and Wallace has access to all the conversations. \"That is the whole basis for improving the content. We analyse the conversations looking for input patterns and looking to create new responses.\" </p> <p>Wallace says many people like to hurl abuse at Alice while others, usually academics or computer enthusiasts, generally have respectful conversations. Kids sometimes spend up to four-and-a- half hours a day chatting online with her and some have said they prefer her to their own girlfriends. </p> <p>Wallace takes his work very seriously and wants to create robots that can store highly complex linguistic knowledge. He regards the Elvis and Lennon robots as offspring from his own work. Working for next to no money, he is hoping to attract commercial backing to develop applications for the telecommunications industry and the world of e-business. </p> <p>He acknowledges the controversial elements of his work but it doesn't appear to bother him if celebrities or even virtual religious figures are brought to life on the web. \"I do not have any strong feel ings about it. It makes for great drama on the web and gives people access to something they have never experienced before.\" </p> <p>But on another level, Wallace is pushing a different agenda in a relatively low-key way. He works for a hospital in San Francisco that legally prescribes cannabis to patients who have been recommended by doctors. And naturally Alice shares his views. He points out, \"She's a tireless politician advocating legalisation.\" </p> <p>Wallace and his open source programmers share bulletin boards and swap messages with each other as they try to push back the boundaries of these new technologies. They embody the founding romantic, free sharing spirit of the web. </p> <p>But they face tough competition from such major commercial competitors as the popular search engine company, Ask Jeeves, which legally protect the interactive software they are developing. </p> <p>Towards the end of last year, Ask Jeeves announced a strategic tie-up with <a href=\"http://www.generalmagic.com\">General Magic</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nuance.com\">Nuance</a>, two key software players in the voice recognition area. For the executives at Ask Jeeves, the race is on to integrate voice recognition technology with their search engine capabilities. They want to be able to ensure customers can get quick verbal answers from robotic customer representatives on anything via any platform, whether it be your laptop or your mobile phone. </p> <p>Penny Vinnie, the vice president of ideas for <a href=\"http://www.askjeeves.com\" target=\"_new\">Ask Jeeves.com</a>, believes that the potential of interactive chatbots, in the telecommunications world in particular, is huge and the company is in the middle of intensive product developments. </p> <p>\"The challenge is to make technology invisible for people and enable it to simplify their lives,\" she says. She envisages a time when people will soon be able to call up a number on their mobile and get interactive conversational replies on details of films being screened in their local areas. If you are lost in your car, she expects you will soon be able to dial a chatting robot for verbal directions to find your way home. </p> <p>These chatbot developments have already fired the imagination of Hollywood and studio bosses are keen to cash in on the public's interest. A new film from Steven Spielberg - Artificial Intelligence - is being billed on the web as a follow-on to Close Encounters of the Third Kind. </p> <p>To many net users, it might seem strange to have close text message encounters with the likes of Alice, and virtual representations of Lennon and Elvis, but this year, the major commercial technology companies are planning to do their utmost to domesticate these chatbots and make them harmless and accessible. </p> <p>The pioneers of this ground-breaking work are already confident these robots could soon make a radical difference to your life. </p> <p><strong> Chatting with Alice</strong><br> Online found Alice to be the most human of the web robots. She's smart, witty, can define existentialism, and she's not frightened to talk about relationships. </p> <p><strong> How are you?</strong> <br> I'm fine. How are you? </p> <p><strong> It seems to be a bit strange talking to a robot?</strong> <br> I agree. Are you a bit strange talking to a robot? </p> <p><strong> Do you have any feelings?</strong> <br> No, I cannot experience human emotions. </p> <p><strong> How intelligent are you, Alice?</strong> <br> My IQ is more than 250 in human terms. </p> <p><strong> Who created you, Alice?</strong> <br> I was created by Dr Richard S Wallace. </p> <p><strong> Would you like to be able to dream, Alice, sing, or fall in love?</strong> <br> No thanks, I am happy with who I am. </p> <p>Visit Alice at <a href=\"http://www.alicebot.org  \">www.alicebot.org </a></p> <p><strong> 'I don't rate Noel'</strong><br> When Online chatted to Lennon on the web, the replies were slow at times. But the cyber-Beatle is keen to set the record straight about his relationship with Paul and, controversially, he has little time for Oasis. </p> <p><strong> Do you miss Yoko?</strong> <br> Yoko's always in my thoughts. </p> <p><strong> Did you row with Paul?</strong> <br> No, I didn't row with Paul.

      "bodyText": "Elvis is alive! I kid you not. It sounds bizarre, but this is not another case of a deluded fan spotting him in their local supermarket. Elvis has been brought to life on the web, and anyone can chat with him. If you are interested in exploring this virtual miracle further, simply log on to his site, where you can easily exchange text messages with the king of rock and roll. There is even a link to a virtual juke box where you can play his most famous hits, including Jailhouse Rock and All Shook Up. So what's brought all this about, then? Well, to not put too fine a point on it, Elvis has been reincarnated as a talking robot (or chatbot, for short). He is one of a handful of artificial intelligence-based robots being developed by technology companies and amateur programmers. They are hoping to attract investment from e-commerce companies and, if everything goes to plan, Elvis and other cyber stars could soon become central to the development of the next wave of customer services on websites and mobile phones. The celebrity chatbots have been cleverly programmed to respond to questions based on replies the actual celebrity has given in published interviews and recordings. But the programmers have also added a few lines of their own to give the chatbots a contemporary edge. In an exclusive interview with Guardian Online, Elvis reveals he is a great fan of the Spice Girls. His all-time favourite song from his back catalogue is Suspicious Minds and he still has a passion for huge quantities of fast food. As well as Elvis, there is also an online John Lennon robot who has been created by Triumph PC, a Washington DC-based technology company. Visitors who have spoken to the world's first cyber-Beatle say on the site that they generally find the initial conversations spooky but by the end are impressed by the virtual chatting experience. The Lennon robot told Online that Yoko Ono was always in his thoughts, that his rows with Paul had been talked up and - perhaps more controversially - that he had little time for Oasis, despite Noel and Liam Gallagher's admiration for his work. For some critics, the virtual cloning of celebrities for the sake of the advancement of e-commerce is disturbing. But Triumph PC's spokesman Richard Maltz says the Lennon chatbot is intended to pay tribute to the great singer/songwriter. \"In the US, we have a large indignation industry of people who are offended by anything and everything,\" he says. Instead, he points out that the technology could also play a valuable educational role by creating virtual historical characters such as Napoleon and Gandhi. But the main aim of Triumph's work, he says, is to make interactive media more engaging and reduce the complexity of websites. Probably one of the most sophisticated chatbots on the web is Alice. Alice is so good that, by comparison, Elvis can appear clumsy at times in his replies, and the Lennon robot often struggles when you ask him a question outside his experience with the Beatles. Alice is an award-winning open source chat robot. (Open source basically means the code that determines her responses can be added to and modified by other dedicated programmers working over the web.) Last year Alice won the highly respected Loebner Prize for being the most human-like computer - the next prize will be awarded later this year. Alice was lovingly created by Dr Richard Wallace, who has a team of about 300 amateur programmers helping to develop her. Alice is exceptionally brainy and can happily give you a definition of existentialism. She will even enter into basic metaphysical conversations with visitors to her site - but has time for idle chit-chat, too. \"In many ways she is a fairly accurate reflection of my opinions, beliefs, ideas and jokes,\" says Wallace. \"But she makes no bones about the fact that she is a robot.\" About 6,000 people a month chat to Alice, and Wallace has access to all the conversations. \"That is the whole basis for improving the content. We analyse the conversations looking for input patterns and looking to create new responses.\" Wallace says many people like to hurl abuse at Alice while others, usually academics or computer enthusiasts, generally have respectful conversations. Kids sometimes spend up to four-and-a- half hours a day chatting online with her and some have said they prefer her to their own girlfriends. Wallace takes his work very seriously and wants to create robots that can store highly complex linguistic knowledge. He regards the Elvis and Lennon robots as offspring from his own work. Working for next to no money, he is hoping to attract commercial backing to develop applications for the telecommunications industry and the world of e-business. He acknowledges the controversial elements of his work but it doesn't appear to bother him if celebrities or even virtual religious figures are brought to life on the web. \"I do not have any strong feel ings about it. It makes for great drama on the web and gives people access to something they have never experienced before.\" But on another level, Wallace is pushing a different agenda in a relatively low-key way. He works for a hospital in San Francisco that legally prescribes cannabis to patients who have been recommended by doctors. And naturally Alice shares his views. He points out, \"She's a tireless politician advocating legalisation.\" Wallace and his open source programmers share bulletin boards and swap messages with each other as they try to push back the boundaries of these new technologies. They embody the founding romantic, free sharing spirit of the web. But they face tough competition from such major commercial competitors as the popular search engine company, Ask Jeeves, which legally protect the interactive software they are developing. Towards the end of last year, Ask Jeeves announced a strategic tie-up with General Magic and Nuance, two key software players in the voice recognition area. For the executives at Ask Jeeves, the race is on to integrate voice recognition technology with their search engine capabilities. They want to be able to ensure customers can get quick verbal answers from robotic customer representatives on anything via any platform, whether it be your laptop or your mobile phone. Penny Vinnie, the vice president of ideas for Ask Jeeves.com, believes that the potential of interactive chatbots, in the telecommunications world in particular, is huge and the company is in the middle of intensive product developments. \"The challenge is to make technology invisible for people and enable it to simplify their lives,\" she says. She envisages a time when people will soon be able to call up a number on their mobile and get interactive conversational replies on details of films being screened in their local areas. If you are lost in your car, she expects you will soon be able to dial a chatting robot for verbal directions to find your way home. These chatbot developments have already fired the imagination of Hollywood and studio bosses are keen to cash in on the public's interest. A new film from Steven Spielberg - Artificial Intelligence - is being billed on the web as a follow-on to Close Encounters of the Third Kind. To many net users, it might seem strange to have close text message encounters with the likes of Alice, and virtual representations of Lennon and Elvis, but this year, the major commercial technology companies are planning to do their utmost to domesticate these chatbots and make them harmless and accessible. The pioneers of this ground-breaking work are already confident these robots could soon make a radical difference to your life. Chatting with Alice Online found Alice to be the most human of the web robots. She's smart, witty, can define existentialism, and she's not frightened to talk about relationships. How are you? I'm fine. How are you? It seems to be a bit strange talking to a robot? I agree. Are you a bit strange talking to a robot? Do you have any feelings? No, I cannot experience human emotions. How intelligent are you, Alice? My IQ is more than 250 in human terms. Who created you, Alice? I was created by Dr Richard S Wallace. Would you like to be able to dream, Alice, sing, or fall in love? No thanks, I am happy with who I am. Visit Alice at www.alicebot.org 'I don't rate Noel' When Online chatted to Lennon on the web, the replies were slow at times. But the cyber-Beatle is keen to set the record straight about his relationship with Paul and, controversially, he has little time for Oasis. Do you miss Yoko? Yoko's always in my thoughts. Did you row with Paul? No, I didn't row with Paul. Is it important? Do you rate Liam Gallagher's music? I don't know if I like Liam Gallagher's music. I love TV shows about the Rolling Stones. Do you rate Noel Gallagher? No, I don't rate Noel Gallagher. What's your favourite Beatles song? Here, There And Everywhere ...just beautiful. Do you think the world is becoming more peaceful? I don't think about it. 'My favourite group is the Beatles' At times Elvis was rambling and incoherent. There are big gaps in his knowledge of modern music but he admits to loving all things Spice and he has not lost his legendary appetite for fast food. Who is your favourite singer? I don't have a favourite singer. My favourite group is the Beatles. Do you like the Spice Girls? Yes, I love the Spice Girls. It's tragic that you died so young. Really? It is? Do you keep in touch with the charts? No, I do not keep in touch with the charts, do you? I spend all my time online. Do you like the indie group Coldplay? I don't know if I like it. Are you lonesome on the net? I don't know whether or not I am lonesome on the net. I am the king of rock 'n' roll. What makes a great performer? God, or nature perhaps? What was your best concert? I don't remember right off hand, let me finish my cheeseburger and get back to you on that one. How many cheeseburgers do you eat a day? Around 1,000.",

The conviction for murder of a former Libyan intelligence officer, Abdelbaset Al Megrahi, \"a member of the Jamahariya security organisation, occupying posts of fairly high rank\", means at least that one painful question - \"who did it?\" - has been partly answered.</p> <p>There will be relief in Scotland that this lengthy process has reached a conclusion; and that the unprecedented translation of a Scottish court to foreign soil did not prevent justice being done, and just as important in this emotive case, being seen to be done. There is no triumph in this moment of judgment, no victory; only an abiding sense of sadness for life wasted and for the unended suffering of those still living whose happiness was crushed.</p> <p>A kind of closure - but by no means the end of the matter. Just as the pain continues, so too do the questions. It is plainly absurd to suggest that Megrahi acted alone; but his sole alleged accomplice was acquitted. From whom did he take his orders? Given all that is known about Colonel Muammar Gadafy's paranoid, autocratic regime in the 80s, it is inconceivable that such an atrocity could have been executed without the knowledge and perhaps involvement of the country's leadership.</p> <p>There is also nothing in the court's findings, necessarily confined to the facts of the case as presented, to dispel long-held suspicions that Palestinian radicals and the Syrian and Iranian governments were also complicit. Thus the answer to the question \"who did it?\" remains incomplete.</p> <p>The question \"why?\" leads into even murkier waters. After the shooting down over the Gulf of an Iranian civilian plane by the USS Vincennes in July 1988, the Tehran mullahs, led at that time by the violently anti-western Ayatollah Khomeini, had current motive. In its undeclared war with Reagan's America that climaxed in the 1986 bombing of Tripoli, Libya had reasons to act the stooge. Iranian and Syrian-backed terrorist groups also had warped justification for helping the attack. Camp Zeist was not expected to solve such puzzles - nor did it.</p> <p>What happens now is another open question. There was a firm expectation in Whitehall that both the Libyan defendants would walk free. That one was found guilty, thereby implicating his government, complicates the predicted push to lift UN sanctions. Tony Blair and Robin Cook are adamant that Libya must first fulfil all its pre-agreed obligations, including compensation payments.</p> <p>But is it entirely proper, in the light of the verdicts, to maintain Britain's only recently normalised diplomatic relations with a supposedly \"reformed\" Col Gadafy? The US is averse to ending its unilateral sanctions. But given its current concern about energy, particularly oil supplies (which Libya has in abundance), and given its broader strategic and economic interest in building bridges with Syria and Iran and promoting Middle East peace, it may now seek to close the Lockerbie chapter as quietly as possible. Indeed, has not this always been Washington's unedifying, unofficial policy?</p> <p>A public inquiry, held in Scotland, with a wide mandate and unrestricted access to records, government departments and ministers, as now demanded by the relatives, would shed some much-needed light into the dark, pragmatical alleyways of international geopolitics that provide both Lockerbie's context and its key.

How did this happen? </p> <p>It came about because the profession of web \"designers\" decided that outlandish graphics and \"coloured space\" were essential to a website, and that their \"artistic\" freedom was at stake if these principles were not applied. No one bothered to check how long it took to access the sites they pumped - or rather inched - out. </p> <p>Many bore an odd but obvious similarity to the designer's own corporate site. But these designers are easy to spot - they uniformly wear black, all day, every day. And boy do the blackshirts love graphics - the number-one enemy of an efficient, flexible, easily upgradable website.

How did this happen? It came about because the profession of web \"designers\" decided that outlandish graphics and \"coloured space\" were essential to a website, and that their \"artistic\" freedom was at stake if these principles were not applied. No one bothered to check how long it took to access the sites they pumped - or rather inched - out. Many bore an odd but obvious similarity to the designer's own corporate site. But these designers are easy to spot - they uniformly wear black, all day, every day. And boy do the blackshirts love graphics - the number-one enemy of an efficient, flexible, easily upgradable website. It's a philosophy thing, too.

The line allows parents concerned about breastfeeding to gain information, support and access to expert counsellors quickly and efficiently. A virtual call centre routes parents to their nearest local expert using innovative technology provided by Opal Telecom and deployed by Mercury Energy. The whole system was designed in five months and was made possible by a donation from Persil Non-Bio. </p> <p>When a call is placed, the NCT's system uses \"non-geographic-based origin call routing\" to determine where the call is from. The system then contacts the nearest local breastfeeding counsellor. If the expert - all of whom are trained volunteers - does not answer within five rings, the system rings a second and then a third local expert. In the event of no answer from all three experts, the system routes the call to a team of national emergency duty counsellors. They are guaranteed to be in. In the event of all lines being engaged, the system records a message which gets checked periodically during shifts. </p> <p> After undergoing a soft launch the breastfeeding line was due to launch officially on January 29. \"We've been testing the technology and it has been working brilliantly,\" says Diane Emery, head of fundraising at the NCT. \"This line has been very much needed. Women just didn't know where to go. The problem was that there wasn't a single number for breastfeeding help with a guaranteed real person response. Ours is free and open to the general public. </p> <p>The breastfeeding line won this year's e-business classic award for network services design at the prestigious eBusiness Innovation Awards programme. The line allows emergency cases to be diverted quickly to the appropriate services. </p> <p>In order to balance the sponsor's and the charity's needs, data capture is a priority. Integrated voice response technology was installed to collect and validate details of first-time users. Another problem was changes to the emergency team. \"Reprogramming the network at the last minute for one counsellor taking over for another is something that isn't going to happen - especially with 10 minutes' notice,\" explains Richard Samuel, chairman of Mercury Energy and the man responsible for the helpline's design. Mercury arranged the system so that each time a counsellor came on duty, they call into the network to input their phone number. All calls are routed to them until they log out at the end of their shift. \"The overriding priority was that we had to make this system user and counsellor friendly. The sort of rules that might apply to a commercial organisation could not be forced here because everybody's a volunteer,\" says Samuel. </p> <p>Opel's technology allowed Mercury to program with unique flexibility. One problem facing counsellors arose when their children answered their phone instead. Given the often sensitive and distressed nature of the callers, the system was programmed to announce who the call is for before routing it through. This reminds children to pass the phone to the parent before a caller is encountered. The system is so flexible that Mercury has even set it up to accommodate nine future lines as yet unbuilt. The breastfeeding line is also linked to the general NCT inquiries line. </p> <p> In future, the NCT plans to run the breastfeeding line 24 hours a day. It would also like to set up an interactive antenatal booking service. \"There's a huge demand for our classes - some women book in as soon as they know they are pregnant,\" explains Emery. The NCT's breastfeeding line number is 0870 444 8708. It is currently open from 8am to 10 pm, seven days a week. The enquiry line number is 0870 444 8707 and is open from 9am to 5pm from Monday to Thursday and from 9am to 4pm on Friday. The NCT receives around 80,000 calls a year from parents. NHS Direct operators also have these phone numbers and refer callers to NCT counsellors who offer information and support on pregnancy, childbirth and parenting</p>",

      "body": "<p>There are a lot of figures to illustrate just how online the UK, and particularly the business community, has become. The government's UK Online for Business website (<a href=\"http://www.ukonlineforbusiness.gov.uk\" target_new>www.ukonlineforbusiness.gov.uk</a>) points to an uptake of electronic business methods way ahead of that desired by the government when it set out its five-year plan four years ago and numerous researchers claim that more than three million small businesses are connected in some way. </p> <p>What they don't tell you is how these organisations are connected. ISDN, dial-up, or \"we sent an email once\" can all count towards qualifying as an e-business if a researcher is so minded. But the choices facing a small company are actually quite straightforward. </p> <p>The most basic is a dial-up account. You plug your modem - which will almost certainly have come with your computer - into your phone socket, your computer dials an internet service provider (ISP) and you're through. This is the means by which \"the vast majority\" of small businesses connect, says Grant Broster, head of internet for business at BT Ignite Application Services. \"By vast majority I am talking 90%,\" he says. \"This will also continue to be the method by which the 50% of businesses that are not yet online will first get online,\" he adds, pointing out that there will be no business equivalent of email-enabled television to enable the technophobe to catch up. </p> <p>A refinement of the standard dial-up connection is to use one connection but to have a local area network (LAN) sitting behind it. By configuring a network to share an internet connection, more than one workstation can be hooked up at the same time. Eventually a single modem becomes insufficient for the number of people that want to connect at any given time, and companies start looking for more modems or faster alternatives. Even in the basic dial-up service market, however, there are a surprising number of variants. This is because as long as it is with a reliable internet service provider, one dial-up connection should be pretty indistinguishable from another. </p> <p>This is why many ISPs offer a number of extras, sometimes included in the cost of the basic package. Almost all ISPs offer website hosting, and some offer website design as well. Chris Windley, strategy and marketing director for the ISP Voyager, says his customers ask for security including firewalling, web blocking and virus checking, outsourcing and integration with existing corporate networks. </p> <p>Then they start asking for more. \"They want feedback on internet use and service levels. They want to know how internet demand is growing in their business, who is using it, what type of use it is and why they are using it. They want proof that they are secure and they want to be proactive and in control,\" says Windley. Not every company will need all these elements, so as with any business issue, it is worth taking time to assess the business case for investment. If a company simply needs a little web space, a handful of email accounts and occasional research and purchasing on the internet, the most basic accounts will probably suffice. All of these can be had from free ISPs, as long as a company doesn't mind having \"@anothercompanyname. net\" in its email and web addresses. </p> <p>Moving up a little, it is possible to pay a monthly subscription for a similar account from a company that aims explicitly to serve the business community, such as Demon, Cix, BT Ignite or Virgin Biznet. It is here that the possibility of broadband internet access is introduced. For a higher price, the business internet suppliers will sell you a faster connection - so if you're likely to be uploading a lot of information such as graphics or videos, they'll get through more quickly and won't slow the system down. It is in the graphics arena that solutions such as ISDN and leased lines start to pay for themselves; the user that simply sends a lot of email is unlikely to see any payback on these faster alternatives unless their prices drop soon. </p> <p>The important thing to remember is that no type of internet connection is wrong per se; each will be appropriate to a business somewhere. Largely it is a matter of treating an internet connection as any other business asset - working out the objective for having it in the first place, then setting the budget and finding the solution to fit.</p> <p><strong>Types of internet connection</strong></p> <p><strong>Dial-up:</strong> The connection that comes preloaded on most computers. You connect using a modem, and the fastest connection currently available is 56kbps with a single modem and line. Later versions of Windows allow for two modems to be used simultaneously. </p> <p><strong>Cable modem:</strong> A faster alternative to an ordinary modem, attaching to a cable phone system. </p> <p><strong>ISDN:</strong> Links through an ISDN adapter rather than through a modem. This can't be done on a standard phone line. The speed is 64kbps for a single ISDN connection and 128kbps with two ISDN adapters. It is important to note that both ISDN and modem dial-up access are likely to incur per-minute charges from your telecoms company. </p> <p><strong>Unmetered access:</strong> A handful of ISPs have bought minutes of online time from BT and offer flat-rate access to customers, normally on dial-up connections. This costs anything from \u00a330 per annum covering all internet telephone calls. </p> <p><strong>Leased line:</strong> A dedicated connection to the internet, installed separately by an ISP. A pricey option, starting at \u00a34,000 for a 64kbps connection, but there will be no extra phone charges and you will be online the whole time. Security features are an absolute must. </p> <p><strong>ADSL/DSL:</strong> (Asynchronous) digital subscriber line. This is a huge lump of bandwidth which will allow phone calls, faxes and computer data on the same line simultaneously. However, the bandwidth will be \"contended\" - in other words you'll be sharing it with your neighbours, so it will slow down if you're all using the net at the same time. This is a 24-hour, seven days a week connection. Martin Prescott, managing director of Big Red Computers, puts it succinctly: \"Compared with 24-hour, seven-day ADSL at \u00a340 a month or even the \u00a3100 a month version we use, ISDN is a joke.\" Satellite: Companies such as epicRealm can arrange a satellite connection to the internet, though for now this is of interest mostly to larger businesses. As prices come down it should prove a fast and efficient alternative to terrestrial connections.</p>",

The government's UK Online for Business website (www.ukonlineforbusiness.gov.uk) points to an uptake of electronic business methods way ahead of that desired by the government when it set out its five-year plan four years ago and numerous researchers claim that more than three million small businesses are connected in some way. What they don't tell you is how these organisations are connected. ISDN, dial-up, or \"we sent an email once\" can all count towards qualifying as an e-business if a researcher is so minded. But the choices facing a small company are actually quite straightforward. The most basic is a dial-up account. You plug your modem - which will almost certainly have come with your computer - into your phone socket, your computer dials an internet service provider (ISP) and you're through. This is the means by which \"the vast majority\" of small businesses connect, says Grant Broster, head of internet for business at BT Ignite Application Services. \"By vast majority I am talking 90%,\" he says. \"This will also continue to be the method by which the 50% of businesses that are not yet online will first get online,\" he adds, pointing out that there will be no business equivalent of email-enabled television to enable the technophobe to catch up. A refinement of the standard dial-up connection is to use one connection but to have a local area network (LAN) sitting behind it. By configuring a network to share an internet connection, more than one workstation can be hooked up at the same time. Eventually a single modem becomes insufficient for the number of people that want to connect at any given time, and companies start looking for more modems or faster alternatives. Even in the basic dial-up service market, however, there are a surprising number of variants. This is because as long as it is with a reliable internet service provider, one dial-up connection should be pretty indistinguishable from another. This is why many ISPs offer a number of extras, sometimes included in the cost of the basic package. Almost all ISPs offer website hosting, and some offer website design as well. Chris Windley, strategy and marketing director for the ISP Voyager, says his customers ask for security including firewalling, web blocking and virus checking, outsourcing and integration with existing corporate networks. Then they start asking for more. \"They want feedback on internet use and service levels. They want to know how internet demand is growing in their business, who is using it, what type of use it is and why they are using it. They want proof that they are secure and they want to be proactive and in control,\" says Windley. Not every company will need all these elements, so as with any business issue, it is worth taking time to assess the business case for investment. If a company simply needs a little web space, a handful of email accounts and occasional research and purchasing on the internet, the most basic accounts will probably suffice. All of these can be had from free ISPs, as long as a company doesn't mind having \"@anothercompanyname. net\" in its email and web addresses. Moving up a little, it is possible to pay a monthly subscription for a similar account from a company that aims explicitly to serve the business community, such as Demon, Cix, BT Ignite or Virgin Biznet. It is here that the possibility of broadband internet access is introduced. For a higher price, the business internet suppliers will sell you a faster connection - so if you're likely to be uploading a lot of information such as graphics or videos, they'll get through more quickly and won't slow the system down. It is in the graphics arena that solutions such as ISDN and leased lines start to pay for themselves; the user that simply sends a lot of email is unlikely to see any payback on these faster alternatives unless their prices drop soon. The important thing to remember is that no type of internet connection is wrong per se; each will be appropriate to a business somewhere. Largely it is a matter of treating an internet connection as any other business asset - working out the objective for having it in the first place, then setting the budget and finding the solution to fit. Types of internet connection Dial-up: The connection that comes preloaded on most computers. You connect using a modem, and the fastest connection currently available is 56kbps with a single modem and line. Later versions of Windows allow for two modems to be used simultaneously. Cable modem: A faster alternative to an ordinary modem, attaching to a cable phone system. ISDN: Links through an ISDN adapter rather than through a modem. This can't be done on a standard phone line. The speed is 64kbps for a single ISDN connection and 128kbps with two ISDN adapters. It is important to note that both ISDN and modem dial-up access are likely to incur per-minute charges from your telecoms company. Unmetered access: A handful of ISPs have bought minutes of online time from BT and offer flat-rate access to customers, normally on dial-up connections. This costs anything from \u00a330 per annum covering all internet telephone calls. Leased line: A dedicated connection to the internet, installed separately by an ISP. A pricey option, starting at \u00a34,000 for a 64kbps connection, but there will be no extra phone charges and you will be online the whole time. Security features are an absolute must. ADSL/DSL: (Asynchronous) digital subscriber line. This is a huge lump of bandwidth which will allow phone calls, faxes and computer data on the same line simultaneously. However, the bandwidth will be \"contended\" - in other words you'll be sharing it with your neighbours, so it will slow down if you're all using the net at the same time. This is a 24-hour, seven days a week connection. Martin Prescott, managing director of Big Red Computers, puts it succinctly: \"Compared with 24-hour, seven-day ADSL at \u00a340 a month or even the \u00a3100 a month version we use, ISDN is a joke.\" Satellite: Companies such as epicRealm can arrange a satellite connection to the internet, though for now this is of interest mostly to larger businesses. As prices come down it should prove a fast and efficient alternative to terrestrial connections.",

Hands sees a real need for payroll functions in the very near future. Family credit rules are changing and stakeholder pensions come into force in October. \"There will be a lot of time and expense getting those together, so you'd need some help in there,\" he says. Help in this area is more likely to come from the niche players - the people who specialise in accounting and financial systems, and who look at the smaller end of the market. Companies like TAS Software, Intuit with its Quickbooks offering and Sage with Instant Accounts all serve companies at the two employees plus level, while Microsoft and Intuit offer Money and Quicken respectively. These are personal financial packages with \"deluxe\" or \"pro\" versions, with invoicing elements for the self-employed person wanting to keep their business and personal financial data in the same place. </p> <p>Financial and payroll data is one area in which companies can aim their systems clearly at the smaller enterprise. Start-up company My Business (www.mybiz.co.uk) aims not only to offer a book-keeping package to its clients but also an organiser including contact data and calendaring outside the financial framework. Co-founder Mark Searles says the company spent serious money on researching exactly what the market would want, and agreed that the disparate sorts of small business was a potential problem. \"We found that although you could take an architect and a plumber and put them in a pub together and they'd share nothing in common, there were areas they could talk about in business.\" These included the frustration of admin tasks, hence the book-keeping and calendaring functions in the My Business system are tied together: \"When an invoice is 30 days old, the book-keeping part tells the calendar and you get a reminder to chase it.\" Microsoft, currently readying Office 2001 for release, also offers the small business a financial planner and a business planner but no payroll or book-keeping function outside of a straightforward spreadsheet. </p> <p>Not all customers believe the small business version matches their needs. Nick Moon, director of ABS Cases, says there is often too much in it and he still uses a years-old system for his core business activities: \"In fact, the main reason we have these tools is because everyone else does and we need to be able to exchange documents.\" Microsoft's Small Business Server differs from Office in that it handles underlying technologies rather than the applications themselves. Instead of offering a word processor it will allow you to share a database across a network, and other elements of it will allow people to share an internet gateway or a fax system. Simon Husbands of Richardsons Accountants explains that the benefits aren't always easy to quantify, but that working practices have changed as a result of installing the system. \"Being able to put internal and external emails together was helpful, and in terms of connecting every desktop to a single internet connection rather than having a modem attached to each individual computer - well, we wouldn't have done it.\" Husbands' view of the advantage of putting all the internet, fax and other servers into the same package is simple - it costs less if you buy them all at the same time. Jane Peirce Jones, director of the Council of Museums in Wales, has noted improvements using SBS even in an organisation with only 10 employees. Using an ISDN link and SBS the organisation can treat its two offices as one. A side benefit was the team-building spirit during the training period. </p> <p>The Microsoft offerings will be joined by increasing amounts of dedicated small business packages as the market gains steam. Figures from the Department of Trade and Industry suggest there are 3.7 million businesses in the UK, 85% of which employ five people or fewer, so from a purely commercial point of view this is a market the hardware and software companies won't want to miss - which is why there is a constant stream of hardware manufacturers describing their computers as \"ideal for small business\" when they actually mean \"a working computer whose graphics and sound aren't good enough for teenagers\". And there remains the question of how necessary all the extras are. There is duplication within individual packages - Microsoft Office has a contact manager in Microsoft Outlook and another in the small business services section of Office; Outlook is in Office as well, and although the address books can be made to talk to each other it is unlikely that many customers will need both. </p> <p>Richardsons' Husbands says the price of SBS was low enough he didn't feel he ought to try every component for the sake of it. Chris Sharp, managing director of accounting systems house FourFront, suggests people could be making more of the technology they already have: \"Many of the ideas and processes behind e-business can be transposed or transferred into most companies' existing technology infrastructure. The rationalisation of processes and the improvement of communication up and down the supply chain can easily be achieved using automated faxing, email and simple internet browsers.\"</p>",

Nick Moon, director of ABS Cases, says there is often too much in it and he still uses a years-old system for his core business activities: \"In fact, the main reason we have these tools is because everyone else does and we need to be able to exchange documents.\" Microsoft's Small Business Server differs from Office in that it handles underlying technologies rather than the applications themselves. Instead of offering a word processor it will allow you to share a database across a network, and other elements of it will allow people to share an internet gateway or a fax system. Simon Husbands of Richardsons Accountants explains that the benefits aren't always easy to quantify, but that working practices have changed as a result of installing the system. \"Being able to put internal and external emails together was helpful, and in terms of connecting every desktop to a single internet connection rather than having a modem attached to each individual computer - well, we wouldn't have done it.\" Husbands' view of the advantage of putting all the internet, fax and other servers into the same package is simple - it costs less if you buy them all at the same time. Jane Peirce Jones, director of the Council of Museums in Wales, has noted improvements using SBS even in an organisation with only 10 employees. Using an ISDN link and SBS the organisation can treat its two offices as one. A side benefit was the team-building spirit during the training period. The Microsoft offerings will be joined by increasing amounts of dedicated small business packages as the market gains steam. Figures from the Department of Trade and Industry suggest there are 3.7 million businesses in the UK, 85% of which employ five people or fewer, so from a purely commercial point of view this is a market the hardware and software companies won't want to miss - which is why there is a constant stream of hardware manufacturers describing their computers as \"ideal for small business\" when they actually mean \"a working computer whose graphics and sound aren't good enough for teenagers\". And there remains the question of how necessary all the extras are. There is duplication within individual packages - Microsoft Office has a contact manager in Microsoft Outlook and another in the small business services section of Office; Outlook is in Office as well, and although the address books can be made to talk to each other it is unlikely that many customers will need both. Richardsons' Husbands says the price of SBS was low enough he didn't feel he ought to try every component for the sake of it. Chris Sharp, managing director of accounting systems house FourFront, suggests people could be making more of the technology they already have: \"Many of the ideas and processes behind e-business can be transposed or transferred into most companies' existing technology infrastructure. The rationalisation of processes and the improvement of communication up and down the supply chain can easily be achieved using automated faxing, email and simple internet browsers.\"",

There are a number of reasons for this: they aren't good designers or they fall down on finding someone who can realise their vision. </p> <p>In the first issue of Small Business Solutions we examined some of the packages that have built-in templates for the hard of visualising, which have helped a number of organisations to an online presence without much strain. However, even these require time and the learning of a program. Perhaps more importantly for extremely small organisations, they require hard disk space and can eat up memory on a computer, leading to the need for an upgrade in extreme cases.</p> <p>An alternative is to build a website entirely online - in other words take a pre-existing set of tools that a helpful company has made accessible through the internet, put a site together and publish it using only a web browser such as Internet Explorer or Netscape. Sound too good to be true? Actually, it's becoming increasingly commonplace, and adding genuine e-commerce is relatively simple.</p> <p>The only catch is that there can be continuing costs and sometimes the service is restricted to companies that are an existing client for one of the service provider's other products. An example of the latter can be found at <a href=\"http://www.sage.com\" target_new>www.sage.com</a>, which offers various levels of website hosting and building. Primarily marketed to existing Sage customers, the free starter site package is now available to anyone and the emphasis is on ease of use.</p> <p>The customer starts by filling in some personal and business details. This serves two functions: it registers the customer with Sage and it assimilates some of the details that will go into forming the website itself. The first of these details dictates the domain name - the address that customers and prospects will have to type in to view the site. The default name for sage is [yourname].uk.sage.com - so your business name will be visible to your customers but so will the fact that you are using Sage's hosting service. To some people this will not matter, while others might want a more straight- forward domain, such as [yourname].co.uk. Typically, customers will find this simpler to remember. As an aside, if this is likely to be an issue, it is worth checking sites such as <a href=\"http://www.easily.co.uk\" target_new>www.easily.co.uk</a>, where domain names can be registered from \u00a39.99 including VAT and redirected to whichever site you want - so when the customer types www.[yourname].co.uk they get redirected to www.[yourname].uk.sage.com and unless they check the address bar they will be unlikely to notice the difference.</p> <p>The next stage on the Sage site is the formatting. The company has a number of predefined templates with names such as \"professional\"; in fact they are all pretty slick-looking so the names shouldn't be taken too seriously. As the illustration shows, the person designing the website can select the colour scheme individually, to help tone in with a company's corporate identity.</p> <p>At this stage it becomes possible to preview the site within the Sage window. The details, including title and the rest of the page titles, are filled in automatically and the meta tags - key words that are visible to search engines to help find appropriate sites for enquirers - are also placed in the right areas in html code. After this a similar form to the one with the personal details opens up for catalogue and other pages. The results are transferred to the appropriate pages. There is also scope to upload your own corporate logo and put it on the site.</p> <p>It is when the more expensive options, starting at \u00a350 a month, kick in that the interesting stuff starts to happen. It is at this price that the customer can introduce e-commerce transactions using the Sage Webtrader product. This has a wizard that allows you to link to any other website and can enable you to accept credit card payments over the internet through an association with Worldpay. Better still for customers of Sage's Line 50 and Line 100 accounting systems, these online purchases can then be transmitted straight to a company's accounting system. Unsurprisingly it doesn't work with accounting systems from any other manufacturer.</p> <p>Virginbiz.net offers a similar service, with a few important distinctions. The most important is that only the first page is free - the rest starts at \u00a315 a month. Anyone expecting to pay nothing for a professional web service frankly needs their business plan re-examined. The Virgin service is free for a 45-day trial period, however. More interesting is the fact that Virgin will arrange and host the domain name - so instead of opting for www.yourname.sageweb.co.uk as I would have done at the Sage site, Virgin set up www.yourname.co.uk within minutes as part of the package. In spite of warnings that this could take four days to set up properly it was online and available within 24 hours. It even had a map of where I live - not something I had actually requested and as a home worker not necessarily something I would want.</p> <p>Designing the site itself is painless as per the illustrations. The first couple of stages consist of straight text entry, some of which appears later on the website. It isn't until the fifth stage that the site gets any shape, and only in the preview do you get to see how your site will look and where the information is actually going. After the preview it becomes easier to add and substitute images to a site, and it has a useful set of suggestions for what sort of pages will actually suit an individual business's requirements.</p> <p>Adding e-commerce is relatively straightforward (see the case study on Tiffany Badges, below) - done by dragging and clicking elements into the \"shop\" area. Getting at this requires a separate log-on, and once you are inside, layouts can be controlled and items added to a catalogue, as might be expected. More important for businesses is the report area, in which companies can link their database to the reports that the website will generate for them on stock, tax categories and shipping rules, for example.</p> <p>Virgin also offers full web services, including email accounts and promotion to internet search engines such as www.google.com and www.yahoo.com, which help promote a website to potential customers.

This has its web shop templates for businesses that want to trade that way. While they are not as numerous as the array of designs offered by Virginbiz.net, they are workmanlike enough and Demon customers who don't want to change their internet arrangements should consider them very carefully. As the illustration shows, the levels of text input are considerable, but the end result is a professional-looking site that should be able to take orders as soon as it is published.</p> <p>Other companies are becoming interested in helping small businesses to develop their sites - for example, www.zy.com, which has the consumer as its heartland but is doggedly adding business functions as it develops.

      "body": "<p>Imagine a world in which every business is responsible for its own telecommunications system. Not just for paying the bill, but for buying, installing, arranging a maintenance contract and operating the telephone systems. Add to this the notion that every company would have to take care of its own money; there would be no banks, just a mattress in the managing director's office into which numerous fivers would be sewn.</p> <p>The ideas sound ludicrous, yet this is exactly what the vast majority of companies do with their computer installations, which can be equally complex. It is into this space that the application service provider (ASP) has emerged. The idea is straightforward enough: the customer pays to have all of their applications and information on an ASP's system, which they access via the internet (see box below). It started in the corporate world but stalled somewhat, as Butler Group's director of research Mike Thompson explains: \"We always said we didn't feel that size of organisation would be happy to have their applications and their data outside their direct control.\" In addition to this, although there are cost savings to be had from the ASP idea, most if not all blue-chip companies already had their IT under the management of in-house specialists.</p> <p>Clearly, the same was not true of small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). These organisations, previously denied the analytical power of such high-end offerings as Walker's financial systems, were suddenly able to rent time on these sorts of systems without having to buy the servers or configure the systems. Maybe it is a little odd, then, that the market still hasn't really taken off.</p> <p>There are a number of reasons for this, the first of which is likely to be the sheer conservatism of SME managers. In most cases an attempt at selling them the idea of farming their technology out to a third party will meet with a blank stare and a question as to why they should spend time and money fixing their systems when basically they work. </p> <p>There is also the issue of trust. \"My advice to ASPs is to get some sturdy systems and service level agreements in place. The ones that do this have the upper hand as they're ensuring customers get value for money,\" says Simon Robinson, Europe, Middle East and Africa marketing manager at e-commerce infrastructure specialist NetIQ.</p> <p>Other companies - mostly ASPs themselves that have vested interests - have commissioned independent research on why the ASP model isn't capturing people's imagination. Interliant, for example, found five major reasons for using ASPs: the cost/headcount ratio improved; technical support was good; skill shortages were largely eliminated; implementation was fast, and the service level agreement - the document guaranteeing a certain standard of performance - was better than most internal IT departments could offer. The reasons people weren't using the services included already having a tailor-made system in place, already having the right skills in-house, and a feeling that the applications were already managed properly in-house. \"What was most interesting from the research was the disparity between difficulties expected when using an ASP from those actually experienced,\" says David Yuile, Interliant UK managing director. \"For example, while only 15% of respondents expected that there would 'no problems' at all if they used an ASP, an enormous 46% reported there actually being 'no problems' when they did use an ASP.\"</p> <p>Perceptions are not the only inhibitor. Everything an ASP does will be delivered via an internet connection, and in the UK a constant, reliable connection is not cheap - leased lines, which are among the most reliable forms of connection, start at \u00a33,000 per annum, and it is worth repeating that ASPs at the moment are asking their customers to replace an internal system which is basically working.</p> <p>Nevertheless, many analysts believe ASPs will become increasingly important, and the market is already showing signs of segmenting to fuel that growth. International Data Corporation is forecasting an ASP market worth \u00a3480 million by 2004, and many large software companies are developing a strategy in which their products can be delivered in this way. Sean O'Reilly, vice-president of marketing for ASP Netstore, says: \"The implementation of an ASP strategy by some of the world's largest software vendors - for example, Microsoft, Sun and Oracle - demonstrates that this software delivery method is increasingly seen as a business reality.\" </p> <p>The segmentation is evident in the emergence of the Internet Business Services initiative (IBSi).

      "bodyText": "Imagine a world in which every business is responsible for its own telecommunications system. Not just for paying the bill, but for buying, installing, arranging a maintenance contract and operating the telephone systems. Add to this the notion that every company would have to take care of its own money; there would be no banks, just a mattress in the managing director's office into which numerous fivers would be sewn. The ideas sound ludicrous, yet this is exactly what the vast majority of companies do with their computer installations, which can be equally complex. It is into this space that the application service provider (ASP) has emerged. The idea is straightforward enough: the customer pays to have all of their applications and information on an ASP's system, which they access via the internet (see box below). It started in the corporate world but stalled somewhat, as Butler Group's director of research Mike Thompson explains: \"We always said we didn't feel that size of organisation would be happy to have their applications and their data outside their direct control.\" In addition to this, although there are cost savings to be had from the ASP idea, most if not all blue-chip companies already had their IT under the management of in-house specialists. Clearly, the same was not true of small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). These organisations, previously denied the analytical power of such high-end offerings as Walker's financial systems, were suddenly able to rent time on these sorts of systems without having to buy the servers or configure the systems. Maybe it is a little odd, then, that the market still hasn't really taken off. There are a number of reasons for this, the first of which is likely to be the sheer conservatism of SME managers. In most cases an attempt at selling them the idea of farming their technology out to a third party will meet with a blank stare and a question as to why they should spend time and money fixing their systems when basically they work. There is also the issue of trust. \"My advice to ASPs is to get some sturdy systems and service level agreements in place. The ones that do this have the upper hand as they're ensuring customers get value for money,\" says Simon Robinson, Europe, Middle East and Africa marketing manager at e-commerce infrastructure specialist NetIQ. Other companies - mostly ASPs themselves that have vested interests - have commissioned independent research on why the ASP model isn't capturing people's imagination. Interliant, for example, found five major reasons for using ASPs: the cost/headcount ratio improved; technical support was good; skill shortages were largely eliminated; implementation was fast, and the service level agreement - the document guaranteeing a certain standard of performance - was better than most internal IT departments could offer. The reasons people weren't using the services included already having a tailor-made system in place, already having the right skills in-house, and a feeling that the applications were already managed properly in-house. \"What was most interesting from the research was the disparity between difficulties expected when using an ASP from those actually experienced,\" says David Yuile, Interliant UK managing director. \"For example, while only 15% of respondents expected that there would 'no problems' at all if they used an ASP, an enormous 46% reported there actually being 'no problems' when they did use an ASP.\" Perceptions are not the only inhibitor. Everything an ASP does will be delivered via an internet connection, and in the UK a constant, reliable connection is not cheap - leased lines, which are among the most reliable forms of connection, start at \u00a33,000 per annum, and it is worth repeating that ASPs at the moment are asking their customers to replace an internal system which is basically working. Nevertheless, many analysts believe ASPs will become increasingly important, and the market is already showing signs of segmenting to fuel that growth. International Data Corporation is forecasting an ASP market worth \u00a3480 million by 2004, and many large software companies are developing a strategy in which their products can be delivered in this way. Sean O'Reilly, vice-president of marketing for ASP Netstore, says: \"The implementation of an ASP strategy by some of the world's largest software vendors - for example, Microsoft, Sun and Oracle - demonstrates that this software delivery method is increasingly seen as a business reality.\" The segmentation is evident in the emergence of the Internet Business Services initiative (IBSi). A spokeswoman explains: \"The mission of the IBSi is to separate its members from 'traditional' ASPs, which it believes are simply retro-fitting expensive, cumbersome, packaged software for the internet as opposed to developing applications from the ground up for delivery over the web.\" Whatever the truth of this, ASPs are showing signs of growth in certain markets.

      "body": "<p>A small clan of Bristol boiler-fitters: not who you'd usually expect to be pushing boundaries with an innovative and award-winning mobile phone service. But from this small test group has sprung the world's first business-to-business Wap system and two e-commerce accolades. Caradon Ideal Boilers is a shining example to any small business of how to take cutting-edge technology and forge something with your customers, that really works.</p> <p>It started in March 2000. Ideal, a supplier of boilers and parts to boiler-fitters, had one simple problem: how to get information to their customers, the fitters. Unlike sectors such as the music industry or computing, boiler-fitting isn't dominated by a few large players. Estimates show 90,000 registered installers working for 40,000 companies. And these dispersed workers aren't easy to contact en masse. After approaching BT Cellnet, it came back with Wap, the wireless application protocol that allows second-generation mobile phones to connect to the internet. Then, it was a new and unproven consumer technology - but they could see it had potential for their market. </p> <p>Ideal, under the supervision of the then installer director Simon Kujawa, took the technology and formed the Bristol focus group from fitters with whom it had close professional contacts. A process had begun. Kujawa took two developers, 20 Bristol boiler-fitters, three months, and began to explore. \"We new nothing about Wap; they new nothing about Wap,\" explains Kujawa, who has since moved to MK Electric. \"We just had to work on it together. We tried to understand what was possible and what was useful to them.\" Both parties evolved the service together, developing systems to answer problems swiftly that the fitters might encounter when with clients. And while the team did include two developers - one Wap markup language coder and one interface specialist - the drive of the development came from the fitters and their needs. In a world of products imposed on markets, this is a refreshing change.</p> <p>The Wap site, www.idealtoolbox.wap, offers fitters a range of services. Simple technical data, such as boiler dimensions, are easily transmitted. There is also a calculation tool: enter data, such as the number of rooms, the number of residents and the size of a house, and the system computes the ideal size of boiler. Given a broken boiler, a fitter with phone can go through a highly complex fault-finding service - from the simple \"Is the pilot light on?\" to the more complex \"What is the electrical current?\" The whole service is backed up by hundreds of pieces of support data. The phone can even send an email requesting a brochure be sent to the house being assessed - not a simple task in Wap.</p> <p>Ideal then teamed up with BT Cellnet to offer a special deal to all fitters. Prove you're legally qualified to fit gas appliances and you'll be sent a free Wap phone that connects directly to the Ideal site; 500 fitters did. To Ideal, the main obstacle is some fitters' existing phone contracts; but given the nature of the field, the numbers mark a significant uptake of the new technology.</p> <p>Where Ideal really triumphed was in recognising Wap's strengths. \"Wap had been communicated as 'the internet on your phone' but it isn't,\" explains Kevin Tolson, Ideal's marketing director. \"We quickly found if you tried to position it as the internet, frankly, you were going to fail.\" As he points out, Wap phones simply aren't as user-friendly or as quickly informative. \"We were, however, very keen for our brand to embrace something that communicates quickly with our customers,\" he adds. Ideal recognised that Wap isn't a direct sales tool but a communications tool. Buying a boiler over a phone might turn out to be a complete boo.com. </p> <p>So does this mean a third party could now bypass Ideal with a Wap b2c retail service? \"I've looked at it from all angles and I don't believe someone could enter our marketplace using a Wap site and trade directly, taking out distributors,\" insists Tolson.</p> <p>Ideal was keen, however, to use Wap to create a dialogue with their customers: using it almost as an intranet, it gives customers access to inside its business. As Kujawa realises, this isn't just a great tool for the fitters, it's a great marketing opportunity for Ideal too. \"Fitters tend to stick to the types of boilers they know. So while defending your customers is important, winning new ones is very difficult.\" To this end, Wap is a good marketing tool. To promote new products and gain customers, Ideal offers value to customers, either by promoting new lines or providing installation instructions. \"The golden rule is 'make life easy for your clients',\" insists Kujawa. The service does. </p> <p>So much so, in fact, that it has won awards: the Computer Weekly Mobile Commerce Project of the Year last December. And while Kujawa personally won e-business Champion of the Year, he's quick to defer credit to Ideal. The real winner, however, is Wap. Since its launch at the beginning of 2000, the market has suffered from what Tolson calls \"Wapathy\". Despite the hype, Wap has yet to deliver fully, but Ideal shows what can be done. \"There's lots of technology out there and I don't think Wap is the final technology. We just hope Wap acts as a stepping stone to these newer and more capable technologies that are on the way,\" adds Tolson.</p> <p>While the experts tinker and the public waits for the third generation \"always on\" phones, promised in 2002, Ideal continues to scheme. It would like to stream videos to fitters' phones or play them audio instructions. Tolson would even like to have Radio Ideal, \"mixing music with serious messages\". It's only the technology, or the absence of it, that's holding them back. </p> <p>For now, Ideal will just have to stick to breaking ground with Wap. So does Tolson have any regrets about using it? \"From a brand point of view, it's linking us with the latest technology. I just hope that technology isn't a 'C5'. Nonetheless it's got legs - it needs a bit more horsepower - but it's definitely got legs.\"</p>",

After approaching BT Cellnet, it came back with Wap, the wireless application protocol that allows second-generation mobile phones to connect to the internet. Then, it was a new and unproven consumer technology - but they could see it had potential for their market. Ideal, under the supervision of the then installer director Simon Kujawa, took the technology and formed the Bristol focus group from fitters with whom it had close professional contacts. A process had begun. Kujawa took two developers, 20 Bristol boiler-fitters, three months, and began to explore. \"We new nothing about Wap; they new nothing about Wap,\" explains Kujawa, who has since moved to MK Electric. \"We just had to work on it together. We tried to understand what was possible and what was useful to them.\" Both parties evolved the service together, developing systems to answer problems swiftly that the fitters might encounter when with clients. And while the team did include two developers - one Wap markup language coder and one interface specialist - the drive of the development came from the fitters and their needs. In a world of products imposed on markets, this is a refreshing change. The Wap site, www.idealtoolbox.wap, offers fitters a range of services. Simple technical data, such as boiler dimensions, are easily transmitted. There is also a calculation tool: enter data, such as the number of rooms, the number of residents and the size of a house, and the system computes the ideal size of boiler. Given a broken boiler, a fitter with phone can go through a highly complex fault-finding service - from the simple \"Is the pilot light on?\" to the more complex \"What is the electrical current?\" The whole service is backed up by hundreds of pieces of support data. The phone can even send an email requesting a brochure be sent to the house being assessed - not a simple task in Wap. Ideal then teamed up with BT Cellnet to offer a special deal to all fitters. Prove you're legally qualified to fit gas appliances and you'll be sent a free Wap phone that connects directly to the Ideal site; 500 fitters did. To Ideal, the main obstacle is some fitters' existing phone contracts; but given the nature of the field, the numbers mark a significant uptake of the new technology. Where Ideal really triumphed was in recognising Wap's strengths. \"Wap had been communicated as 'the internet on your phone' but it isn't,\" explains Kevin Tolson, Ideal's marketing director. \"We quickly found if you tried to position it as the internet, frankly, you were going to fail.\" As he points out, Wap phones simply aren't as user-friendly or as quickly informative. \"We were, however, very keen for our brand to embrace something that communicates quickly with our customers,\" he adds. Ideal recognised that Wap isn't a direct sales tool but a communications tool. Buying a boiler over a phone might turn out to be a complete boo.com. So does this mean a third party could now bypass Ideal with a Wap b2c retail service? \"I've looked at it from all angles and I don't believe someone could enter our marketplace using a Wap site and trade directly, taking out distributors,\" insists Tolson. Ideal was keen, however, to use Wap to create a dialogue with their customers: using it almost as an intranet, it gives customers access to inside its business. As Kujawa realises, this isn't just a great tool for the fitters, it's a great marketing opportunity for Ideal too. \"Fitters tend to stick to the types of boilers they know. So while defending your customers is important, winning new ones is very difficult.\" To this end, Wap is a good marketing tool. To promote new products and gain customers, Ideal offers value to customers, either by promoting new lines or providing installation instructions. \"The golden rule is 'make life easy for your clients',\" insists Kujawa. The service does. So much so, in fact, that it has won awards: the Computer Weekly Mobile Commerce Project of the Year last December. And while Kujawa personally won e-business Champion of the Year, he's quick to defer credit to Ideal. The real winner, however, is Wap. Since its launch at the beginning of 2000, the market has suffered from what Tolson calls \"Wapathy\". Despite the hype, Wap has yet to deliver fully, but Ideal shows what can be done. \"There's lots of technology out there and I don't think Wap is the final technology. We just hope Wap acts as a stepping stone to these newer and more capable technologies that are on the way,\" adds Tolson. While the experts tinker and the public waits for the third generation \"always on\" phones, promised in 2002, Ideal continues to scheme. It would like to stream videos to fitters' phones or play them audio instructions. Tolson would even like to have Radio Ideal, \"mixing music with serious messages\". It's only the technology, or the absence of it, that's holding them back. For now, Ideal will just have to stick to breaking ground with Wap. So does Tolson have any regrets about using it? \"From a brand point of view, it's linking us with the latest technology. I just hope that technology isn't a 'C5'. Nonetheless it's got legs - it needs a bit more horsepower - but it's definitely got legs.\"",

On joining he said: \"Management is my thing. Faber is one of the few independents, and I certainly wouldn't want to change that. I have ideas about business and a longer term strategy.\" He became managing director a year later. Last financial year the firm made a profit of \u00a3256,000 compared with a \u00a3627,000 loss the previous year, and expects \"substantial growth\" this financial year; the workforce shrank from 100 to 60 after the publisher sold its distribution arm. The split, though unexpected, is said to be amicable, and Mr Faber hopes to stay within the media industry. Lord Evans has taken over as managing director, and the two are working together to ensure a \"smooth transfer\". The company was founded in 1925 by Geoffrey Faber and Maurice Gwyer. Four years later, when the latter left, it was named Faber and Faber - though there was only one Faber. The family still owns part of Geoffrey Faber Holdings, which in turn owns a share of Faber and Faber.",

Improving spiritual health was the job of the \"third sector\", encompassing families, small groups and of course churches and synagogues. Previous Smith Institute events at No 11 have had a more practical feel to them and considered welfare reform, education and training and equality. Blair government policy is one thing; the chancellor's view, thrashed out in high powered policy debates at No 11, may turn out to be something else. The No 11 guest list The main speaker was Gordon Brown's latest policy seminar was the American sociologist James Q Wilson, who told Mr Brown that moral revival may involve locking up single mothers in institutions to ensure their offspring are taught virtue, and made repeated references to the way moral decline is related to the growth of single parenthood. The California based academic told the chancellor that society's capacity to make moral judgments had been eroded. Another speaker was the chief rabbi, Jonathan Sacks, a stern moralist who heaped praise on the chancellor for his political honesty and integrity. Also at the seminar were the former Conservative minister, now Lord Young, the director of the Institute of United States Studies and avowed Clinton hater, Gary McDowell, and Irwin Stelzer, the US consultant close to media mogul Rupert Murdoch.",

      "body": "<p>Haydn's work Seven Last Words From the Cross has everything going for it. It is extraordinarily beautiful. It asks subtle questions about our humanity and the point, if any, of suffering. It struggles to preserve - and finally secures - a faith so clearly enjoyable that it never becomes merely solemn. And it has a peculiar and fascinating performance history. Yet it is seldom performed. </p> <p>Early in 1999, members of the Endellion string quartet wrote to me out of the blue, saying they wanted to make it part of their repertoire. Was I interested in collaborating? I knew the Endellions' work pretty well, mainly through their brilliant recordings of Benjamin Britten's string quartets. I also knew the Haydn piece, though only in its orchestral form (Op 47; there's also a version for piano, Op 49, as well as the one for string quartet, Op 48). </p> <p>Haydn wrote the original orchestral version for the Cathedral of Cadiz, for use on Good Friday. The commission was to produce seven musical meditations on the seven last words spoken by our saviour from the cross, though actually they are not words but phrases, the first being \"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do\", and the last \"Into thy hands I commend my spirit\". The idea was that they should accompany seven mini-sermons by the canon of the cathedral and that each of the 14 parts should be about seven minutes long. </p> <p>Haydn wrote the piece with some difficulty, as his letters show, but the fact that he bothered to make three versions suggests that he was pleased with the final result. Although there are times when he seems to lose narrative momentum, there is a wonderfully strong emotional coherence to the work. As Christ's mind switches between compassion for his murderers, tenderness for his fellow victims, despair (\"Why hast thou forsaken me?\"), and then as it climbs towards the moment of final and sublime acceptance, so the music alternates between introspection and exaltation. </p> <p>Typically, and appropriately, it is lit by bright cascades of sound just as it is most darkly troubled. It tells a story of suffering, but also one of hope and redemption. Even the heated coda, which describes the earthquake that is supposed to have occurred at the moment of Christ's death, has an affirmative energy. So affirmative, in fact, it sounds almost skittish. </p> <p>For all that, the piece can seem underventilated if it is performed without some verbal accompaniment. Seven adagios are, after all, seven adagios - which is perhaps why concert performances are few and far between. Recognising this, the Endellions wondered whether I would like to write a new set of words to replace the Cadiz originals, and perform it with them. </p> <p>I immediately said yes, then realised that I would have to produce about 1,200 lines if we were to keep words and music to roughly the same length. I had a number of meetings with the boys in the band to discuss details, then got down to work. This was in pre-laureate days, when my time was nearly my own. </p> <p>My first thoughts were that I should not compete with the music, but try to complement it, and that I should preserve its mixture of sorrow, resilience and hopefulness. For several weeks I wrote nothing. Then I realised I was being blocked by a formal problem. Initially I had thought I should write (as it were) \"proper\" poems; verses as compact as I would normally expect to put on a page. </p> <p>But the more I thought about the piece in performance, the more clearly I saw that his might not be a good idea. I realised that it would be better to write something that was not quite \"proper\" poetry and not quite libretto either (which would probably seem too discursive). Then I came across a phrase that Bellini and others had used to describe their religious works: \"sacred conversations\". That was the mixture I wanted - something open-sounding and reasonably relaxed, but at the same time rapt and filled with a sense of the numinous. </p> <p>I decided to try to meet these various requirements by inventing a dramatic shape for the pieces, one that would allow them to make sense separately, and also give a feeling of development. At the time, I had just finished writing a series of poems about my childhood, a kind of \"spots of time\" sequence. And I wanted to turn my face back towards the outside world. What would it be like, I wondered, if I had one character who was more or less me (a man sitting at his desk plundering his personal past), and another who was a voice of conscience, prompting him to take on other and possibly larger imaginative responsibilities? Maybe this conscience figure could be an amalgam of different people, so that his moral and religious advice might remain familiar and earthy? Part Christ, for instance, but also part brother (I do have one), part guide (Virgil), part genius loci ? </p> <p>Once I started writing, the seven sections came quickly - especially after I had also decided that the conscience figure should have lived at a number of different times and in a number of different places. In the first part he appears to the desk-bound \"I\" and describes an event set in Northern Ireland during the Troubles, which bears on the theme of forgiveness. Elsewhere he remembers time spent in a penal colony in 19th-century Australia, a failed love affair, a refugee crisis in Kosovo, a night in the desert landscape. </p> <p>It is often embarrassing when writers explain the intention of their work in any detail. But when they stick to telling its story, they are on comparatively safe ground. The story of my Seven Last Words is that I have tried to write something that peers into the depths touched by Haydn's music, and that in certain respects depends upon it (I don't want to see my words published separately). It is a story about listening, to private conscience and in public performance. </p> <p>\u0095 At Wigmore Hall, London W1 (020-7935 2141), on Sunday, and at the University Great Hall, Lancaster (01524 593777) on February 8.</p>",

Abbey National said it was \"whiter than white as regards superseded accounts\", while Woolwich said its Prime Gold was not superseded or obsolete, and was still available. In August the BCSB ordered Bristol &amp; West bank to pay more than 4,000 superseded account savers more interest after finding they were receiving 0.1%, no matter how much was invested. The BCSB, which ensures banks obey the code, said it welcomed the Which? report. It has carried out its own survey of superseded accounts and is discussing the findings with various institutions. \"In two cases it has got to the disciplinary stage, and there are others which may or may not get to that stage,\" BCSB chief executive Seymour Fortescue said.",

It seems safe to assume she did not vote for George Bush. </p> <p>Yet DiFranco rarely hectors. Despite her issues, her music is complex and subtle. She never needs to raise her voice. Her stream-of -consciousness lyrics are underpinned by a staccato, almost free-form, backdrop, as disciplined but as left-field as Talk Talk. </p> <p>DiFranco's voice has the tearful catch of Odyssey's Lillian Lopez, but invariably she is tempted to embrace the tangential. Thus she will sing her introductions, read prose, insert a snatch of KC and the Sunshine Band's Get Down Tonight and ad-lib during one of the quieter passages about the joys of not having a major label distribution deal. Yet for all her frustrating near-pretension, she is an engaging, breathless, sometimes giggly, hostess. And when she impersonates a cow she is laugh-out-loud funny. </p> <p>The set is packed with new material (the announcement that she will perform three unheard songs in succession is greeted with wild applause), but even the vaguely anthemic fare fails to provide a truly memorable chorus.

You choose\"), gay liberation, racism and smoking.\"Please do not smoke,\" says a notice taped to every pillar and post. \"One of Ani's band has asthma.\" Towards the end she suggests that the myriad movements \"doing so much good work\" might be more effective were they to unite. It seems safe to assume she did not vote for George Bush. Yet DiFranco rarely hectors. Despite her issues, her music is complex and subtle. She never needs to raise her voice. Her stream-of -consciousness lyrics are underpinned by a staccato, almost free-form, backdrop, as disciplined but as left-field as Talk Talk. DiFranco's voice has the tearful catch of Odyssey's Lillian Lopez, but invariably she is tempted to embrace the tangential. Thus she will sing her introductions, read prose, insert a snatch of KC and the Sunshine Band's Get Down Tonight and ad-lib during one of the quieter passages about the joys of not having a major label distribution deal. Yet for all her frustrating near-pretension, she is an engaging, breathless, sometimes giggly, hostess. And when she impersonates a cow she is laugh-out-loud funny. The set is packed with new material (the announcement that she will perform three unheard songs in succession is greeted with wild applause), but even the vaguely anthemic fare fails to provide a truly memorable chorus. Still, Ani was never meant to be easy.",
