Mothers said they would take more time off than fathers, but among men the scheme appealed most to those on the lowest incomes. </p> <p>Ms Kelly said: \"I would argue for the full \u00a3150 per week for 13 weeks. It would be affordable and have a huge impact on take-up, particularly among fathers. It's a very simple scheme and could create a climate which changes the culture. </p> <p>\"It would allow parents to spend more time with children and juggle the responsibilities of an increasingly complex working life.\" </p> <p>The two ministers for women, Lady Jay and Tessa Jowell, and equal opportunities minister Margaret Hodge, are in favour of the proposal. Ms Jowell said yesterday: \"Parental leave is one of the most important issues, both for labour market policy and family policy, for people in Britain today.\" </p> <p>Pressure groups last night urged Mr Byers to take the Rowntree findings seriously. Sarah Jackson, co-chief executive of Parents at Work, said: \"We know from parents who call our helpline that they cannot afford to take this leave unless it is paid. We talk to a lot of low income families who are desperate to take time off to spend with their children but cannot do so.\" </p> <p>Christine Gowdridge, director of the Maternity Alliance, which coordinates a national coalition of campaigners under the Parental Leave Campaign, said the Rowntree research was \"one more brick in the wall of ammunition in favour of paid leave\". </p> <p>However, the CBI gave the proposals a cool reception. It said that a survey of its members found 72% of businesses \"very worried\" about parental leave, ranking it as one of their leading concerns. </p> <p>John Cridland, the CBI director of human resources policy, said: \"Businesses have had enough of new regulations. We cannot cope with more and the more we are pressed the more negative we will get.\" </p> <p>The ICM survey found that 40% of voters - and 43% of women - questioned would be more likely to vote for a party that promoted paid parental leave, while only 4% said they would be less likely to do so.</p>",

Mr Byers, who is in charge of government policy on maternity pay and parental leave, said: \"This is a significant piece of work which will inform our consideration of this important area.\" Government ministers are to start lobbying business to persuade them that paid parental leave will be good for firms, leading to a more contented workforce and helping them attract and keep key staff. While ministers are keen to maintain business support for the government, they believe the scheme would help the government appeal to women voters who backed Tony Blair in the 1997 election but have since started to have second thoughts. At a Downing Street seminar last month, Labour party strategists argued that Labour needs to trump William Hague's appeal to so-called \"Florida woman\". Ms Kelly's blueprint - costed by the accountants KPMG and due to be published in a Fabian pamphlet next month - has found favour with Downing Street, where the expected arrival of Cherie Blair's fourth child next month has sharpened the debate about parental leave, and is being strongly pressed by Labour's women ministers. The government introduced an unpaid scheme for parental leave last December, but projections indicate that, without payment, only 2% of men and 35% of women would take advantage of the offer of time off. However, a poll conducted by ICM and sponsored by the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust found that 97% of the 729 parents questioned would be \"very interested\" or \"interested\" in a paid scheme, and that the amount of time taken off work would increase with the generosity of the scheme. Parents would take 1.53 weeks' leave on average at \u00a375 a week, but this would rise to 5.1 weeks at \u00a3150 a week. Mothers said they would take more time off than fathers, but among men the scheme appealed most to those on the lowest incomes. Ms Kelly said: \"I would argue for the full \u00a3150 per week for 13 weeks. It would be affordable and have a huge impact on take-up, particularly among fathers. It's a very simple scheme and could create a climate which changes the culture. \"It would allow parents to spend more time with children and juggle the responsibilities of an increasingly complex working life.\" The two ministers for women, Lady Jay and Tessa Jowell, and equal opportunities minister Margaret Hodge, are in favour of the proposal. Ms Jowell said yesterday: \"Parental leave is one of the most important issues, both for labour market policy and family policy, for people in Britain today.\" Pressure groups last night urged Mr Byers to take the Rowntree findings seriously. Sarah Jackson, co-chief executive of Parents at Work, said: \"We know from parents who call our helpline that they cannot afford to take this leave unless it is paid. We talk to a lot of low income families who are desperate to take time off to spend with their children but cannot do so.\" Christine Gowdridge, director of the Maternity Alliance, which coordinates a national coalition of campaigners under the Parental Leave Campaign, said the Rowntree research was \"one more brick in the wall of ammunition in favour of paid leave\". However, the CBI gave the proposals a cool reception. It said that a survey of its members found 72% of businesses \"very worried\" about parental leave, ranking it as one of their leading concerns. John Cridland, the CBI director of human resources policy, said: \"Businesses have had enough of new regulations. We cannot cope with more and the more we are pressed the more negative we will get.\" The ICM survey found that 40% of voters - and 43% of women - questioned would be more likely to vote for a party that promoted paid parental leave, while only 4% said they would be less likely to do so.",

Wenger is worried that eight of his travelling squad - all but one of them probable starters - are one booking away from a ban which would mean missing the final on May 17. Among them are his captain Tony Adams, Martin Keown, Emmanuel Petit and Dennis Bergkamp, playing his first away game in the Uefa Cup after travelling under the Channel on Eurostar. Wenger fears the card count will be high in such a finely balanced tie but insists that the risk \"won't influence me in terms of selection. And it shouldn't change the attitude of the players at all. You can't go into the game considering that you must not get booked. You have to play your game.\" In future, said Wenger, at this stage cautions \"shouldn't count for the final. Yellow cards given in semi-finals should go into the next season.\" In these games, he argues, with so much at stake, \"the intensity is higher\". Lens have already raised the temperature. \"We will put more craziness into our game to try to unsettle Arsenal,\" said their coach Fran\u00e7ois Brisson. \"This is our biggest match of the season, without a doubt.\" Wenger has urged his players - and Arsenal's supporters - to remain calm in the face of any provocation. The authorities are on full alert, recalling the sickening attack on a gendarme here by German hooligans during France 98. Arsenal (probable, 4-4-2): Seaman; Dixon, Keown, Adams, Silvinho; Parlour, Vieira, Petit, Ljungberg; Bergkamp, Henry.",

      "bodyText": "Up to 500 \"hard core\" protesters are planning to disrupt the May Day bank holiday by rioting in London during a series of anti-capitalist demonstrations and marches, police sources revealed yesterday. Three forces - the Metropolitan police, City police and British Transport police - have cancelled leave for uniformed officers because of the threat, which was identified after undercover work by Scotland Yard's special branch. While thousands of officers will be available if trouble starts, the police fear high visibility policing on the streets could be seen as provocative. The plan is to keep many officers in reserve and deploy them in rapid reaction units as and when violence flares. Police \"spotters\" will mingle with the crowds and radio for back-up if there is a repeat of the mayhem which erupted during similar protests on June 18 and November 30 last year. The Guardian has learned that the police increased the number of closed circuit television cameras in the City following those disturbances and there is now blanket coverage in vulnerable areas. Millennium eve apart, sources said, the police operation to deal with the demonstrations was \"the biggest in 30 years\". Police anxiety about the protests was heightened by recent riots in Washington and Seattle, and the breakdown in communication between senior police officers and some of the protest groups which are known to be involved in organising events. There was a degree of cooperation between the police and a planning committee made up of members of Reclaim the Streets, the Socialist Workers party, and the Anarchists Federation, but the group disintegrated because of political in-fighting. \"We have tried to work with groups to organise the protests, but they will not cooperate with us,\" said one senior officer. \"We haven't heard anything from them, but we will keep trying. \"Special branch has provided us with intelligence about some of the events that have been planned, and we have been monitoring internet traffic. \"Half the problem is, we just don't know which events will go ahead and which will fall by the wayside.\" One of the biggest events is expected to be the Guerrilla Gardening Action demonstration on May 1 in Parliament Square. It is being organised by several groups, including Reclaim the Streets, and protesters are being encouraged to bring gardening equipment to plant seeds. Last year a police officer was seriously injured when he was hit from behind by a demonstrator wielding a spade. The officer is still off work suffering from spinal injuries. Earlier on May Day, the group Cyclists have a Right to Move will demonstrate at Hyde Park corner. Both protests are considered high risk in terms of potential disruption. Other events, including an anarchists' seven-a-side football tournament on April 29, will be monitored \"with interest\". A police source added: \"Ninety per cent of the people who will come to London will behave peacefully, but we believe a hard core of between 400 and 500 will come to the capital to cause mischief and have a punch-up.\" The police arrested 101 people last June following violent anti-capitalist protests in the City. Another 120 rioters were identified, but not caught.",

Do you think that would work?</p> <p>\"This may be a long way to a solution, but it is a much smoother way, I can assure you.\"</p> <p>After a meeting with white farmers and leaders of the black land invaders on Wednesday, Mr Mugabe said the two sides had agreed there would be no more violence and it was therefore not necessary to send more police to the occupied farms.</p> <p>The president, who has ruled Zimbabwe for 20 years, has endorsed the invasions and refused to condemn violence against white farmers, whom he accuses of colonial and racist attitudes. Mr Mugabe's ruling Zanu-PF party faces parliamentary elections within the next four months and, for the first time since independence, faces the possibility of defeat.</p> <p>Mr Mugabe, whose presidential term runs until 2002, has accused white farmers of bankrolling the opposition, undermining his revolution and clinging to land stolen from the people by British colonial authorities.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The government of Zimbabwe has deployed its own army officers to direct farm invasions by war veterans and Zanu-PF supporters, a leading Zimbabwean newspaper claims today. The news comes as squatters' leaders announced a 'cessation of hostilities' - although attacks on white farmers have continued unabated. According to a report in the Zimbabwe Independent, \u0093commanders\u0094 have been appointed by the government to coordinate logistics such as providing food and supplies. It is thought they may also have provided the AK-47 assault rifles and other automatic weapons used by squatters, and government trucks to transport food. Leaders in the region will hold a summit this weekend to discuss the deepening crisis - and the continuing war in the Congo. Presidents Thabo Mbeki of South Africa, Sam Nujoma of Namibia and Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique will meet Zimbabwe's leader, Robert Mugabe, at the Victoria Falls resort. Zimbabwe's main opposition leader has condemned the political killings in his country but said they would not intimidate his party into boycotting upcoming elections. \"We are not retreating,\" said Morgan Tsvangirai, head of the Movement for Democratic Change. Calling Mugabe \"a deranged dictator,\" Tsvangirai said his recent trip abroad was meant to garner support for his movement and to look ahead to a Zimbabwe after Mugabe. \"We have to look postively beyond Mugabe. Mugabe is history,\" he said, shortly after arriving home from a week-long trip to Britain, South Africa and the United States. Meanwhile, President Robert Mugabe today rejected offers of international help to tackle land reform in his country. \"We can reach our own settlement, I don't think we need help from the United Nations - this is not a United Nations issue yet,\" Mr Mugabe told BBC radio in a recorded interview as Zimbabwe grappled with its worst economic and political crisis since independence in 1980. Asked if he might accept input from Britain - the former colonial power in Zimbabwe - or from the European Union to try to resolve the issue, he said: \"The people in Europe don't understand how deeply this land issue touches our hearts.\" Thousands of black veterans of the former Rhodesia's 1970s liberation war have occupied hundreds of white-owned farms over the past two months. Two white farmers and a police officer have been killed in clashes linked to the occupations. Mr Mugabe said that he would not force an immediate withdrawal. \"These are war veterans who fought for the country, and the army also has war veterans in it,\" he said. \"Would you want me to set war veterans in the army against war veterans outside the army? Do you think that would work? \"This may be a long way to a solution, but it is a much smoother way, I can assure you.\" After a meeting with white farmers and leaders of the black land invaders on Wednesday, Mr Mugabe said the two sides had agreed there would be no more violence and it was therefore not necessary to send more police to the occupied farms. The president, who has ruled Zimbabwe for 20 years, has endorsed the invasions and refused to condemn violence against white farmers, whom he accuses of colonial and racist attitudes. Mr Mugabe's ruling Zanu-PF party faces parliamentary elections within the next four months and, for the first time since independence, faces the possibility of defeat. Mr Mugabe, whose presidential term runs until 2002, has accused white farmers of bankrolling the opposition, undermining his revolution and clinging to land stolen from the people by British colonial authorities.",

Useful to know that, next time Aunt Ann gets started on family values.\"</p> <p> <strong>Ruth Rendell</strong>, in the <strong>Sunday Times</strong>, gave the book a neat back-handed compliment: \"This novel is full of dull things yet, paradoxically, it is not dull. You want to go on reading, you want to know what happens, it isn't easy to put down. And this, perhaps, is because of the moving portrait she creates of the disabled boy, and a skill she may not know she has in depicting his parents' pain. The image of lifeless Jeremy laid on the floor in front of a flickering screen, clean and fresh, dressed in new clothes, a mobile swinging above his upturned face, will not be easy to forget.\" Rendell's conclusion was a delight: \"Widdecombe once memorably said of a certain Home Secretary that he had 'something of the night about him'. She has something of a Sunday afternoon about her, but her book is readable and, not surprisingly, she is good on the political bits.\"</p> <p> <strong>David Sexton</strong>, in the <strong>London Evening Standard</strong>, found The Clematis Tree \"an extremely strange book. It is sincere and serious. On the other hand, it is completely devoid of plausible contemporary reference ... [It] is one long course in misery, perked up only by a little crucifix waving.

The adverts, headlined 'Tonight must be about football', include a plea in both English and Turkish from Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale for good behaviour. </p> <p>\"Whatever the result I ask everyone to ensure their visit to Elland Road is safe,\" says Ridsdale. \"It is important that all of us take the opportunity to show the world that we will not allow the futility of violence and personal injury to cast a shadow over football in this country.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile Leeds boss David O'Leary has admitted that there is an air of depression among the players in the run up to the game. \"I just think they've been so saddened with what happened in Istanbul and with the funerals over the last couple of days,\" he said. \"But the whole city has become a gloomy place and the players feel that. They've been upset and they feel why should they be smiling when everybody is down - and you also feel how lucky you are.\"</p> <p><strong>FOR GOODNESS SAKE JUST CLICK BELOW OR THEY'LL BE HERE FOREVER</strong></p> <p>Enter First Direct's Little Fella Challenge and you could win a VW Beetle or Sony Wega Widescreen TV.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.firstdirect.com/littlefella/index.html\">Click here</a></p> <p><strong>EVERYBODY LOVES A LOSER</strong></p> <p>Last night's Big Cup action caused the world to spin off its axis as Manchester United scored fewer goals in a football match than the other team they were playing in it. Obviously, with news as stunning as this, it'll take a while for the nation to pick themselves up off the floor - either because they're totally gutted or they're still curled up in a belly-clutching ball, guffawing like a banshee. Luckily, the Fiver took a less emotional view - we were watching the snooker on the other side anyway - and is up and about to report on United's reaction to their Big Cup exit.</p> <p>\"It's bitterly disappointing,\" said one-man disaster zone Roy Keane. \"Hopefully we will be back next year and we can put it right,\" he promised, surprisingly gaining the Fiver's sympathy. \"It won't be difficult to pick ourselves up because we've got a championship to win,\" he proudly concluded. What a sweetheart!</p> <p>\"We've always gone on the premise that if you win a game, you forget about it and go on to the next one,\" explained Teddy Sheringham, who has never made any reference to the events of last May at all, anywhere, ever. \"This will be no different. We've got to win the League now and it would be a travesty if we lost that,\" he bravely claimed. The little soldier!</p> <p>As you can see, everyone at Old Trafford is obviously in a state of shock - even Alex Ferguson was sensationally caught on camera being magnanimous in defeat.

Salas. Simeone. Veron. Want. Want. Want. It is perhaps this character trait which has led them to purchase the skilful and excellent Brazilian footballer Rivaldo from Barcelona for a world-record \u00a331m.</p> <p>According to respected Italian sports paper Gazzetta Dello Sport, the Rome giants have responded to being humiliated in Big Cup by offering Rivaldo a five-year contract worth at least \u00a33m-a-year. The 28-year-old World Player of the Year has apparently agreed to the deal and is set to put his name - Rivaldo (Mr) - to paper imminently.</p> <p>As the Gazzetta's report has been described in a Lazio tantrum as being \"without substance\", the Fiver assumes it must be true. That being the case, Rivaldo will play out the rest of the season in the classic Barca colours before pulling on the not-quite-as-classic-because-<br>it-looks-a-bit-like-Coventry biancocelesti shirt. Meanwhile, the only thing left to do is settle the \u00a331m tab - Lazio have offered Barca cash plus their pick of Alen Boksic, Matias Almeyda, Dejan Stankovic and Marcelo Salas, all of whom have been tossed aside like spent Furbies.</p> <p><strong>OUR EASTER TANTRUM</strong></p> <p>What?

      "bodyText": "LEEDS MAKE ADVERT PLEA Leeds United have placed full-page adverts in tabloid newspapers which appeal for calm at their Uefa Cup match against Galatasaray tonight. The adverts, headlined 'Tonight must be about football', include a plea in both English and Turkish from Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale for good behaviour. \"Whatever the result I ask everyone to ensure their visit to Elland Road is safe,\" says Ridsdale. \"It is important that all of us take the opportunity to show the world that we will not allow the futility of violence and personal injury to cast a shadow over football in this country.\" Meanwhile Leeds boss David O'Leary has admitted that there is an air of depression among the players in the run up to the game. \"I just think they've been so saddened with what happened in Istanbul and with the funerals over the last couple of days,\" he said. \"But the whole city has become a gloomy place and the players feel that. They've been upset and they feel why should they be smiling when everybody is down - and you also feel how lucky you are.\" FOR GOODNESS SAKE JUST CLICK BELOW OR THEY'LL BE HERE FOREVER Enter First Direct's Little Fella Challenge and you could win a VW Beetle or Sony Wega Widescreen TV. Click here EVERYBODY LOVES A LOSER Last night's Big Cup action caused the world to spin off its axis as Manchester United scored fewer goals in a football match than the other team they were playing in it. Obviously, with news as stunning as this, it'll take a while for the nation to pick themselves up off the floor - either because they're totally gutted or they're still curled up in a belly-clutching ball, guffawing like a banshee. Luckily, the Fiver took a less emotional view - we were watching the snooker on the other side anyway - and is up and about to report on United's reaction to their Big Cup exit. \"It's bitterly disappointing,\" said one-man disaster zone Roy Keane. \"Hopefully we will be back next year and we can put it right,\" he promised, surprisingly gaining the Fiver's sympathy. \"It won't be difficult to pick ourselves up because we've got a championship to win,\" he proudly concluded. What a sweetheart! \"We've always gone on the premise that if you win a game, you forget about it and go on to the next one,\" explained Teddy Sheringham, who has never made any reference to the events of last May at all, anywhere, ever. \"This will be no different. We've got to win the League now and it would be a travesty if we lost that,\" he bravely claimed. The little soldier! As you can see, everyone at Old Trafford is obviously in a state of shock - even Alex Ferguson was sensationally caught on camera being magnanimous in defeat. So come on, Fiver readers, let's pick them up and give them a big cuddle. Send your very sincere messages of support to the not-in-any-way-run-by-the-Fiver email account manutdplc@hotmail.com. Remember - we love them now they're losers (and any titles gained over the weekend don't count). QUOTE OF THE DAY \"I have no worries about the passion of the game. We will manage to keep a cool head this time\" - Liverpool manager Gerard Houllier recklessly tempts fate before tomorrow's derby match with Everton.

Click here TOY STORY 52 Like a small spoilt child who is fed up with their bloody old Tamagotchi and wants a special Pikachu edition Pokemon instead or they'll be sick all over their remote-control Buzz Lightyear, Lazio simply must have all the best players in the world. Salas. Simeone. Veron. Want. Want. Want. It is perhaps this character trait which has led them to purchase the skilful and excellent Brazilian footballer Rivaldo from Barcelona for a world-record \u00a331m. According to respected Italian sports paper Gazzetta Dello Sport, the Rome giants have responded to being humiliated in Big Cup by offering Rivaldo a five-year contract worth at least \u00a33m-a-year. The 28-year-old World Player of the Year has apparently agreed to the deal and is set to put his name - Rivaldo (Mr) - to paper imminently. As the Gazzetta's report has been described in a Lazio tantrum as being \"without substance\", the Fiver assumes it must be true. That being the case, Rivaldo will play out the rest of the season in the classic Barca colours before pulling on the not-quite-as-classic-because- it-looks-a-bit-like-Coventry biancocelesti shirt. Meanwhile, the only thing left to do is settle the \u00a331m tab - Lazio have offered Barca cash plus their pick of Alen Boksic, Matias Almeyda, Dejan Stankovic and Marcelo Salas, all of whom have been tossed aside like spent Furbies. OUR EASTER TANTRUM What? You mean to say you haven't got us an egg?!? Well, that's it! You've done it now! We're going and we're not coming back until Tuesday!!! THE RUMOUR MILL Sunderland are poised to make a bid for Kaizer Chiefs South African international striker Siyabonga Nomvete, after he impressed in two loan spells at the club. Arsenal are interested in Lens midfielder Alex Nyarko. The powerful 26-year-old Ghanaian has scored once in 21 appearances this season. NEWS IN BRIEF Real Madrid defender Roberto Carlos could be in hot water with Uefa for reportedly winning \u00a31.65m after allegedly placing a five-figure bet on the correct score of 3-2 in Wednesday night's victory over Manchester United. West Ham's Joe Cole has suffered a fracture of his right leg. The injury, suffered in a clash with Derby's Rory Delap last Saturday, will rule out Cole for the rest of the season. Everton's record signing Nick Barmby will sign a new deal at the end of the season which will keep him at Goodison until at least 2005. Tranmere manager John Aldridge has been fined a total of \u00a3750 and warned over his behaviour following his misconduct hearing at the FA today. The former Republic of Ireland international faced three charges, one of which stemmed from his clash with Leicester midfielder Theo Zagorakis during the Annual Leicester Challenge (sponsored by Worthington) on February 27. Massimo Taibi has told Alex Ferguson he wants to come back to Manchester United. \"Nobody should be judged on four games,\" the Italian keeper claims.

      "bodyText": "Lord Haw Haw, the Nazi sympathiser who broadcast anti-British propaganda from Germany, slipped out of Britain days before the outbreak of war under the noses of MI5, documents released today show. William Joyce - who earned his nickname by his blend of Irish brogue and cockney he tried to disguise as a \"public school\" voice as he delivered his propaganda broadcasts beginning with the phrase \"Germany calling\" - had made no secret of his pro-Nazi views. MI5 files reveal that the security service intercepted a letter from Joyce to a suspected German spy announcing his intention to leave Britain. A secret memo warned he was \"quite willing to take action inimical to this country in order to further the campaign against the supposed 'world Jewish conspiracy'\" and recommended he should be detained in the event of war. Joyce first came to MI5's attention as an outspoken supporter of Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists. A 1937 intelligence report argued that Joyce's \"irritability of manner\" suggested that his \"inner man\" felt his talents had not been properly recognised and that he secretly regarded Mosley as a \"conceited popinjay\". Joyce subsequently set up his own pro-Nazi organisation - the National Socialist League. MI5 intercepted his correspondence, including letters he exchanged with Christian Bauer, a German journalist expelled from Britain for suspected espionage. They were particularly concerned about \"somewhat cryptic messages\" from Bauer for his brother Quentin who worked at the Air Ministry and who shared Joyce's pro-Nazi views. On July 20 1939 - in a letter opened by MI5 - Joyce wrote to Bauer to tell him Quentin was planning to travel to Berlin in early September. On September 1, the police special branch was despatched to arrest him, only to discover that he had escaped a few days earlier. Though born in the US, the son of a naturalised Irish-American father, he studied at the London School of Economics. After the war he was sentenced to death for treason - the courts ruled that despite his background, Joyce held a British passport. One of Joyce's tasks in Germany was to persuade British prisoners of war to join the fight against Bolshevism.

      "bodyText": "Thousands of refugees have \"flooded\" into Britain. There are complaints about the lack of \"adequate machinery\" to meet the \"unforeseen contingency\". A detention centre has been set up to \"check and carefully sift\" them. In language with an eerie contemporary resonance, MI5 documents released today at the public record office show how \"aliens\" - as they were then called - were vetted and controlled during the second world war. Sir David Petrie, head of the agency, proudly told the foreign secretary, Anthony Eden, how by the late summer of 1940 \"practically every potentially dangerous person, whether British or foreign, had been swept into the net\". He added: \"The subsequent gradual process of release led to a complete ticketing and labelling of those whom it was thought safe to discharge.\" But, he added in his memo written in 1944, \"a new complication arose from the great number of totally unknown alien refugees who flooded into this country after Hitler had overrun western Europe\". Sir David went on: \"No adequate machinery existed to meet this unforseen contingency [of] thousands of refugees in all classes\" coming to Britain. Some had come to continue the fight against German occupation of their country. But Sir David warned: \"There were many others of a different calibre, who came to this country primarily for their own good and with no particular loyalty to anyone.\" He explained to Eden how MI5 had set up a London detention centre early in 1941 at the Royal Patriotic School in Wandsworth, south London. \"Fortunately\", he said, \"no harm seems to have resulted.\" Indeed, he concluded that \"the great majority have been perfectly innocent\".",

The former minister intends to brandish the documents during today's House of Lords second reading debate on the bill, with Lord Falconer, the Cabinet Office minister, already anticipating a rough ride on Labour's contentious legislation. Revolts are expected over proposals to allow Cabinet ministers to veto the release of information; refuse to publish the facts behind policy making; and keep secret information obtained during criminal investigations. Mr Straw looks certain to capitulate in one area, by deciding that no council leader or mayor can override Elizabeth France, the new information commissioner, if she orders the release of documents. Lord Dubs intends to show fellow peers policy and briefing papers on a meeting he had in 1998 with the Irish transport minister, Noel Dempsey, to tighten up road safety measures between the republic and Northern Ireland. The papers - released by the Irish - reveal that Dublin was proposing to introduce a United Kingdom penalty point system for motoring offences to cut road accidents. The high death toll and serious injuries on both sides of the border made road safety an issue in Anglo-Irish talks.

The volume of spending in the shops rose 0.5% last month and by 4.6% in the year to March.</p> <p>This, according to conventional wisdom, is much too fast to be sustainable for any length of time without rekindling inflation and will put further pressure on interest rates. It follows Wednesday's figures showing average earnings rising at an eight-year high of 6%. People are earning too much and spending too much - so it's time to slap on the brakes.</p> <p>Or is it? Look at the details of the spending figures and you find that while the volume of spending has gone up by 4.6% over the year, the value (which is what is important for inflation) has risen by only 1.6%. In other words, shops can't make price increases stick, despite the sharp rise in purchasing power.</p> <p>This unusual phenomenon was reflected in the inflation figures earlier this week, which showed that the underlying increase in prices was only 2.0% for the year. Why isn't inflation rising when there is so much money sloshing around?</p> <p>There are several reasons. Globalisation, the strong pound (which makes imports cheaper) and the effects of the internet. The knowledge that people can buy cheap imported alternatives or search the web for better bargains is preventing shopkeepers from raising their prices.</p> <p>For the moment this has produced a nirvana of high earnings and low prices. We could be entering a long period of low prices. But we may never be given a chance to know.</p> <p>The trouble is that there is usually a time lag before high wages force prices up - and that's what the Bank of England is worried about. It is under a legal obligation to prevent the underlying rise in prices from exceeding 2.5%, and as there is a time lag of up to 18 months before rises in interest rates affect the economy it isn't tempted to take chances.</p> <p>The Bank will probably ignore the fact that the 6% rise in earnings is exceptional (buoyed up by one-off city bonuses and the effects of the minimum wage on hotels and catering). Stand by for another increase in interest rates - internet or no internet.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Today's figures for retail trade put the problems of the economy in a nutshell. The volume of spending in the shops rose 0.5% last month and by 4.6% in the year to March. This, according to conventional wisdom, is much too fast to be sustainable for any length of time without rekindling inflation and will put further pressure on interest rates. It follows Wednesday's figures showing average earnings rising at an eight-year high of 6%. People are earning too much and spending too much - so it's time to slap on the brakes. Or is it? Look at the details of the spending figures and you find that while the volume of spending has gone up by 4.6% over the year, the value (which is what is important for inflation) has risen by only 1.6%. In other words, shops can't make price increases stick, despite the sharp rise in purchasing power. This unusual phenomenon was reflected in the inflation figures earlier this week, which showed that the underlying increase in prices was only 2.0% for the year. Why isn't inflation rising when there is so much money sloshing around? There are several reasons. Globalisation, the strong pound (which makes imports cheaper) and the effects of the internet. The knowledge that people can buy cheap imported alternatives or search the web for better bargains is preventing shopkeepers from raising their prices. For the moment this has produced a nirvana of high earnings and low prices. We could be entering a long period of low prices. But we may never be given a chance to know. The trouble is that there is usually a time lag before high wages force prices up - and that's what the Bank of England is worried about. It is under a legal obligation to prevent the underlying rise in prices from exceeding 2.5%, and as there is a time lag of up to 18 months before rises in interest rates affect the economy it isn't tempted to take chances. The Bank will probably ignore the fact that the 6% rise in earnings is exceptional (buoyed up by one-off city bonuses and the effects of the minimum wage on hotels and catering). Stand by for another increase in interest rates - internet or no internet.",

      "body": "<p>What's in your trolley following a trip to the local supermarket? Bread and milk? Fruit and veg? Perhaps the odd television or a computer? </p> <p>In the past couple of years supermarkets have increasingly focused on non-food products such as clothing, perfume and now, electrical goods because they offer far better profit margins than can be charged on food. </p> <p>Tesco has launched seven electrical stores-within-stores and plans to roll out 50 more in the next year. Meanwhile, Asda, now owned by US retailer Wal-Mart, which has a strong track record in selling electrical goods, is to launch a hypermarket chain called Supercentre in July. It will introduce new product categories and extend the George clothing brand into housewares, toys and books. It will also sell computers and software, small electrical goods, and, possibly, white goods such as fridges and freezers. </p> <p>Asda already has special promotions on TVs, videos and DVD players and there are bargains to be had. It claims to offer the best-value DVD player in Britain at \u00a3177.99 - that's \u00a31.01 cheaper than the DVD player on sale at Tesco. </p> <p>\"Supermarkets are very opportunistic about electrical retailing,\" says Mike Godliman, a retail analyst. \"They usually get a certain line in and sell it as a one-off promotion. It's all about unbeatable deals that draw in consumers to buy a DVD player or whatever, and then turning them into loyal customers.\" </p> <p>Tesco started selling electrical goods in 1998 and sold a healthy 10,000 DVD players at \u00a3179 in a week. \"It's been amazingly successful,\" says Simon Soffe of Tesco. \"We can sell them cheaper because our margins are much lower than high street electrical retailers.\" </p> <p>It's an issue that concerns the Radio, Electrical and TV Retailers Association, Retra. \"The products on offer in supermarkets are to entice people in. The supermarkets are not trying to make serious profit margins from them,\" explains Retra chief executive, Fred Round. </p> <p>If the supermarkets aren't interested in making big profits from electrical goods, does that make it a good deal for consumers? Well, up to a point. </p> <p>Unlike high street electrical stores such as Dixons or Comet supermarkets may not have products available when it suits you. As Soffe explains: \"We buy an allocation of computers, for example, from a manufacturer such as Fujitsu or Siemens-Nixdorf and we sell them very fast.\" </p> <p>If you don't buy quickly, then stocks are likely to have run out and the offers - which Asda calls WOWs - are rarely repeated. Once offers have gone, that's it - consumers can't plan to buy a product next month when there is a bit more space on the credit card. </p> <p>Another problem is that many products are only available at the larger stores which have sufficient shelf space. Tesco is trying to address this by launching \"cyberzones\" within its stores where customers can order anything from books to fridges through Tesco's internet site. Customers will also get free access to the entire web and not just Tesco's site. </p> <p>Supermarkets are working on an opportunistic basis, striking deals with manufacturers as and when they can, which means the range of goods on offer is limited. If you are looking for something in particular, you may be better off going to your local electrical retailer. </p> <p>\"At the end of the day we offer customer choice with a much wider range of products available. And a lot of our prices are equivalent if not better than in the supermarkets,\" says Dixons. Asda is selling a Bush DVD 2000 for \u00a3177.99 and while Dixons does not sell that particular product it says that its equivalent own-brand product costs \u00a3169.35. </p> <p>If you want a leading brand name you may also be disappointed. Asda's TVs and videos are supplied by German manufacturer Schneider - hardly a household name in the UK. Tesco's DVD players are made by Wharfedale. </p> <p>The lack of top brand names is not necessarily the supermarkets' fault. Just as the makers of designer perfume, Levi jeans and Calvin Klein felt supermarkets weren't an upmarket enough environment for their brands, it's the same with some manufacturers of electrical goods. \"We have sold some big brands such as Amstrad TVs, for example, but some famous brands have an issue about supplying us,\" says Soffe. </p> <p>Perhaps the biggest issue is one of service. Both Dixons and Retra say that consumers who buy electrical goods at supermarkets don't receive the sort of expert advice they would get from a specialist on the high street. </p> <p>But Tesco insists consumers know what they want. \"They have often done their research either by reading magazines or on the internet and don't want a sales pitch,\" says Soffe. </p> <p>If electrical goods develop faults within a year, Tesco customers will be offered a full refund or exchange. The company also set up a dedicated help line with Fujitsu when it sold a batch of its computers. \"That meant that consumers who had queries about setting up their PCs could talk straight to the experts.\" </p> <p>Not all consumers' needs are the same, explains consumer consultant Paul Edwards. \"Some require assistance and so if they want to buy a computer they will go to PC World or wherever. But lots of people are confident about making these types of purchases and trust big name supermarkets like Tesco. If they can buy their car insurance or other financial services at the supermarket then buying a telly is no problem.\" </p> <p>And it's convenient, adds Edwards. \"People lead such busy lives but if you buy your TV from the supermarket along with your cornflakes there are no problems with parking and you don't need to make another trip. Besides they are offering some great bargains.\" </p> <p>And those bargains might be extended to leading brands in the near future, says Godliman. \"Although it tends to be secondary brands on offer at the moment, I think the stigma of having your brand sold in the supermarket will disappear. Leading brands will increasingly want to get in there - after all, they want to sell as many products as possible.\" </p> <p>If supermarkets are serious about selling electrical goods on a permanent basis rather than as special promotions then they will face a number of challenges such as training staff, ensuring that repairs or refunds are dealt with efficiently and organising delivery of bigger items.</p>",

It claims to offer the best-value DVD player in Britain at \u00a3177.99 - that's \u00a31.01 cheaper than the DVD player on sale at Tesco. \"Supermarkets are very opportunistic about electrical retailing,\" says Mike Godliman, a retail analyst. \"They usually get a certain line in and sell it as a one-off promotion. It's all about unbeatable deals that draw in consumers to buy a DVD player or whatever, and then turning them into loyal customers.\" Tesco started selling electrical goods in 1998 and sold a healthy 10,000 DVD players at \u00a3179 in a week. \"It's been amazingly successful,\" says Simon Soffe of Tesco. \"We can sell them cheaper because our margins are much lower than high street electrical retailers.\" It's an issue that concerns the Radio, Electrical and TV Retailers Association, Retra. \"The products on offer in supermarkets are to entice people in. The supermarkets are not trying to make serious profit margins from them,\" explains Retra chief executive, Fred Round. If the supermarkets aren't interested in making big profits from electrical goods, does that make it a good deal for consumers? Well, up to a point. Unlike high street electrical stores such as Dixons or Comet supermarkets may not have products available when it suits you. As Soffe explains: \"We buy an allocation of computers, for example, from a manufacturer such as Fujitsu or Siemens-Nixdorf and we sell them very fast.\" If you don't buy quickly, then stocks are likely to have run out and the offers - which Asda calls WOWs - are rarely repeated. Once offers have gone, that's it - consumers can't plan to buy a product next month when there is a bit more space on the credit card. Another problem is that many products are only available at the larger stores which have sufficient shelf space. Tesco is trying to address this by launching \"cyberzones\" within its stores where customers can order anything from books to fridges through Tesco's internet site. Customers will also get free access to the entire web and not just Tesco's site. Supermarkets are working on an opportunistic basis, striking deals with manufacturers as and when they can, which means the range of goods on offer is limited. If you are looking for something in particular, you may be better off going to your local electrical retailer. \"At the end of the day we offer customer choice with a much wider range of products available. And a lot of our prices are equivalent if not better than in the supermarkets,\" says Dixons. Asda is selling a Bush DVD 2000 for \u00a3177.99 and while Dixons does not sell that particular product it says that its equivalent own-brand product costs \u00a3169.35. If you want a leading brand name you may also be disappointed. Asda's TVs and videos are supplied by German manufacturer Schneider - hardly a household name in the UK. Tesco's DVD players are made by Wharfedale. The lack of top brand names is not necessarily the supermarkets' fault. Just as the makers of designer perfume, Levi jeans and Calvin Klein felt supermarkets weren't an upmarket enough environment for their brands, it's the same with some manufacturers of electrical goods. \"We have sold some big brands such as Amstrad TVs, for example, but some famous brands have an issue about supplying us,\" says Soffe. Perhaps the biggest issue is one of service. Both Dixons and Retra say that consumers who buy electrical goods at supermarkets don't receive the sort of expert advice they would get from a specialist on the high street. But Tesco insists consumers know what they want. \"They have often done their research either by reading magazines or on the internet and don't want a sales pitch,\" says Soffe. If electrical goods develop faults within a year, Tesco customers will be offered a full refund or exchange. The company also set up a dedicated help line with Fujitsu when it sold a batch of its computers. \"That meant that consumers who had queries about setting up their PCs could talk straight to the experts.\" Not all consumers' needs are the same, explains consumer consultant Paul Edwards. \"Some require assistance and so if they want to buy a computer they will go to PC World or wherever. But lots of people are confident about making these types of purchases and trust big name supermarkets like Tesco. If they can buy their car insurance or other financial services at the supermarket then buying a telly is no problem.\" And it's convenient, adds Edwards. \"People lead such busy lives but if you buy your TV from the supermarket along with your cornflakes there are no problems with parking and you don't need to make another trip. Besides they are offering some great bargains.\" And those bargains might be extended to leading brands in the near future, says Godliman. \"Although it tends to be secondary brands on offer at the moment, I think the stigma of having your brand sold in the supermarket will disappear. Leading brands will increasingly want to get in there - after all, they want to sell as many products as possible.\" If supermarkets are serious about selling electrical goods on a permanent basis rather than as special promotions then they will face a number of challenges such as training staff, ensuring that repairs or refunds are dealt with efficiently and organising delivery of bigger items.",

This has not endeared them to locals, especially as Ridsdale was at the comparable function in Istanbul when he got word of the murders. The Turkish team have promised, however, to wear black armbands tonight and that has won back a little respect. The acid test, all agree, will be policing and behaviour in Leeds' pub and club-infested centre after the game, particularly if United get knocked out of the competition. The few Turkish-owned businesses - mostly restaurants and cafes - will get extra protection, and although the game will be screened across the city, most venues are banning visitors who wear club shirts or other obviously partisan gear. Leeds is nervous but also aware of an opportunity, which has been bolstered by a trouble-free night for Galatasaray at their team hotel (Leeds players had threatening calls in their bedrooms the night before the first-leg match in Istanbul.) Tonight's match, said Assistant Chief Constable Paul Garvin, could at best be a great tribute to Loftus and Speight, and a way to link the name of Leeds with generosity and fair play.",

      "bodyText": "The shape of the mayoral contest is now becoming clear. There is no real desire to have the Conservatives back. People's memories aren't that short. People now know why there are real doubts about the suitability of Ken Livingstone - doubts about policy, doubts about statements he has made, doubts about what he stands for. And every day people realise more and more that being Mayor of London is actually a very serious job. It is a policy job with real power and influence over London. The real frustration in this contest is that despite the power of the Mayor's job, it has become a policy free zone. Ken Livingstone says he will have a Green as his deputy but what will that mean for London? What policies has he agreed with his new partners? Mr Norris says he wants to privatise the tube. But what is cost of that, what delay would it cause to vital work? On transport, probably the most important issue in this election, there is still nowhere near enough focus on what the alternatives put forward by the candidates would mean. There would be three main effects of the public sector bond scheme advocated by Ken Livingstone. First it would mean delay. The tube needs investment now, not at some dim and distant date in the mists of time. The negotiations for the government's PPP plans are well underway. Ken Livingstone would call a halt to the whole thing if he had his way and hold back investment, possibly for years in the future. Secondly, Ken Livingstone's proposals are a millstone of debt for London. The independent report from the London Business School said just a couple of weeks ago that \"The investment and maintenance costs over the first 15 years of the PPP are likely to be at least \u00a32.3bn less than with bond financing.\" And third, he wants the fast introduction of congestion charges to pay for his proposals - his manifesto may have left the figure out, but the cost to drivers will be 35 per day or \u00a3100 a month. Delay, debt, congestion charges - it is a cost that Londoners should think long and hard about before casting their votes on the 4th of May. Then there is the Conservative candidate. The first thing he has tried to do is drop any mention that he is a Conservative. The Party that dare not speak its name. He told Time Out \"I'm not standing for the Conservative Party\" but however much he may try to hide it or run away from it, I have to remind Steve Norris that he is William Hague's Conservative candidate in this election. We know what he would do for London because he's been here before as transport minister for London. He once said the jubilee line extension would be \"the greatest achievement of my time in office.\" The JLE has of course improved the underground but it turned out to be two years late; it was \u00a31.9 billion over budget; its endless cost overruns meant the rest of the tube lost out on desperately needed investment; and it had to be sorted out by this government. Overpriced, overdue and starved of investment. That was the London underground when Steve Norris was in charge. That's the past. But in the future the Conservatives would privatise the tube and bring to London Rail Privatisation Mark II. Mr Norris said only a few months ago, \"Full privatisation is the best alternative\" It is the wrong policy for three reasons: First, like public sector bonds, privatisation would also delay new investment in the tube. Second, Londoners would not want those parts of the underground such as safety, the running of the trains and ticketing placed in private hands. What we plan is increased investment in what remains a public service. And thirdly, under the Tory plans privatisation is also a means to remove funds from London. The Tory manifesto at the last election said the proceeds from privatisation would not all be spent in London. They said \"The majority of the remaining surplus from privatisation will be channelled into additional support for transport investment in London and elsewhere in the country\". So the choice on transport - the key issue in this campaign - is clear. Under the Conservatives London will get delay and privatisation. Under Ken Livingstone London will get delay and massive debt. With Frank Dobson and New Labour London will get the fast investment and value for money needed to create a world class underground for a world class city. And I believe that the closer we get to polling day, the more people will turn to Frank. If you want money into the tube fast you will turn to Frank. If you want a candidate who will work with the police and the people of London to fight crime you will turn to Frank. If you want a candidate who will tackle the poverty and social division that still exists in too many parts of London, you will turn to Frank. And if you want a candidate who can represent London on the world stage, again you will turn to Frank. So my message today is, when it comes to the issues that matter, turn to Frank.",

The MPs' report suggests that \"standards are coming second to profitability\". It found that the contract has an \"in-built incentive\" to issue more \"paper\" approvals for benefits claims and carry out fewer actual tests. It also criticises the lack of professionalism in the way doctors have carried out some of the tests. <br> <p><b>What is the government doing about it?</b><br>MPs are now asking the social security secretary, Alistair Darling, to renegotiate the contract with Sema to improve its efficiency. The government may well do so. Disability benefits have risen four-fold since 1980, and the government remains concerned that each week 3,000 people move from sick pay to incapacity benefit, of whom 90% will never return to work.<br></p> <p><b>What is the government doing for disabled people?</b><br>The government is torn between its desire to hold down disability costs while being seen to be an effective champion of disabled rights. Labour's manifesto did not dare broach the subject. But soon after it took office in 1997, it identified disability benefits as the target of reforming cost-cuts. However, the government points to a range of measures showing its commitment to providing disabled people with benefits, rights and job opportunities.<br><br></p> <p>\u0095 <b>Benefits:</b> In January, the government announced two small improvements in disabled-benefit provision, worth \u00a35.5m a year to 52,000 people.

The eligibility criteria for incapacity benefit was tightened to discourage new claimants. A means test was also introduced for incapacity benefit, which claws back the \u00a366.75-a-week benefit from people with private pensions or insurance payments, even if they are living below the poverty line (defined as half average income).</p> <p>\u0095 The government went ahead with cuts, despite the fact that soon after it emerged that the <a href=\"http://www.dss.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">department of social security</a> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,3953186,00.html\" target=\"_new\">saved \u00a31.7bn in 1998/99 through underspending</a>.

The second choice, Raimond van der Gouw, had proved himself an adequate deputy in Europe but, as Bordeaux proved, remained accident-prone.</p> <p> With Savio and Steve McManaman tending to tuck in behind Raul and Fernando Morientes, Real set out to put pressure on United's centre-backs with swift exchanges of passes. And an early low centre from Roberto Carlos on the left, which just cleared the far post, would surely have brought a goal had Raul been on the end of it.</p> <p> For United, Dwight Yorke and Andy Cole were tightly marked, so much depended on Ryan Giggs and Beckham spreading the play while Keane and Scholes found opportunities to drive forward from midfield. Yet it was quite a time before United gained sufficient possession to establish any sort of attacking momentum.</p> <p> In fact the goal that Old Trafford feared should have arrived in the 13th minute after Gary Neville's misreading of a high ball allowed Roberto Carlos a clear run on the left. The Brazilian's pass found Morientes but Van der Gouw easily saved a weak shot.</p> <p> Neville was giving United an uncomfortable rerun of his errors during the Fifa world club championship in Rio. No sooner had Yorke's head failed to find the target after meeting Giggs's precise centre than the defender passed back straight to Roberto Carlos, who was denied a shot only by the alertness of Van der Gouw.</p> <p> Worse, for United, was soon to follow. In the 20th minute McManaman found Morientes who laid a pass out to Michel Salgado. Van der Gouw had Salgado's weak cross-shot covered but Keane lunged in to block it and diverted the ball into his own net.</p> <p> As Iker Casillas punched clear a shot from Yorke, blocked one from Scholes and then kept out another, from Keane, United's chances of scoring at least twice to save the tie hung in the balance.</p> <p> One of the most worrying aspects for United was the fact that, although Giggs was regularly turning Real's defence on the left, they were not exploiting this advantage in front of goal. Cole was convinced that, as he rose to meet the ball under the bar Aitor Karanka reached up a hand to deflect it away. Certainly the defender tried but whether he made contact was doubtful.</p> <p> With Raul shooting too high after a miscue by Stam, who then deflected a centre from McManaman dangerously close to his own net, the portents for United in the second half were not promising. Yet no one could have predicted the course of events which saw Real Madrid take a 3,0 lead by the 52nd minute.</p> <p> Five minutes after the break Real caught United on the break and McManaman clipped the ball to Raul, in space to his right. This time Raul did not miss, curling a shot into the far corner.</p> <p> There was time for Keane to waft a valuable chance to start saving the tie over the top before Raul scored again. With the defence nowhere Redondo reached the byline and set up the striker for a tap-in.</p> <p> Then in the 64th minute Beckham reminded Old Trafford of the art of the possible by outwitting a clutch of defenders before hooking a marvellous shot high into the net. Later Casillas made a point blank save to deny the substitute Ole Gunnar Solksjaer.</p> <p> * Real Madrid now meet Bay ern Munich after a 3,2 aggregate win over Porto. In the last minute Jardel levelled for Porto but Thomas Linke headed the winner seconds later. Paulo Sergio scored Bayern's first.</p> <p> Manchester United (4-4-2): Van der Gouw G.

In fact the goal that Old Trafford feared should have arrived in the 13th minute after Gary Neville's misreading of a high ball allowed Roberto Carlos a clear run on the left. The Brazilian's pass found Morientes but Van der Gouw easily saved a weak shot. Neville was giving United an uncomfortable rerun of his errors during the Fifa world club championship in Rio. No sooner had Yorke's head failed to find the target after meeting Giggs's precise centre than the defender passed back straight to Roberto Carlos, who was denied a shot only by the alertness of Van der Gouw. Worse, for United, was soon to follow. In the 20th minute McManaman found Morientes who laid a pass out to Michel Salgado. Van der Gouw had Salgado's weak cross-shot covered but Keane lunged in to block it and diverted the ball into his own net. As Iker Casillas punched clear a shot from Yorke, blocked one from Scholes and then kept out another, from Keane, United's chances of scoring at least twice to save the tie hung in the balance. One of the most worrying aspects for United was the fact that, although Giggs was regularly turning Real's defence on the left, they were not exploiting this advantage in front of goal. Cole was convinced that, as he rose to meet the ball under the bar Aitor Karanka reached up a hand to deflect it away. Certainly the defender tried but whether he made contact was doubtful. With Raul shooting too high after a miscue by Stam, who then deflected a centre from McManaman dangerously close to his own net, the portents for United in the second half were not promising. Yet no one could have predicted the course of events which saw Real Madrid take a 3,0 lead by the 52nd minute. Five minutes after the break Real caught United on the break and McManaman clipped the ball to Raul, in space to his right. This time Raul did not miss, curling a shot into the far corner. There was time for Keane to waft a valuable chance to start saving the tie over the top before Raul scored again. With the defence nowhere Redondo reached the byline and set up the striker for a tap-in. Then in the 64th minute Beckham reminded Old Trafford of the art of the possible by outwitting a clutch of defenders before hooking a marvellous shot high into the net. Later Casillas made a point blank save to deny the substitute Ole Gunnar Solksjaer. * Real Madrid now meet Bay ern Munich after a 3,2 aggregate win over Porto. In the last minute Jardel levelled for Porto but Thomas Linke headed the winner seconds later. Paulo Sergio scored Bayern's first. Manchester United (4-4-2): Van der Gouw G. Neville, Berg (Sheringham, 62min), Stam, Irwin (Silvestre, h-t) Beckham, Keane, Scholes, Giggs Cole (Solksjaer, 62), Yorke. Real Madrid (4-4-2): Casillas Salgado, Ivan Campo, Karanka, Roberto Carlos McManaman (Julio Cesar, 89), Helguera, Redondo, Savio (Geremi, 65) Morientes (Anelka, 72), Raul.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair today renewed his backing for Frank Dobson in the London mayoral race and attacked Ken Livingstone's plans for a congestion charge which he claims could cost drivers \u00a3100 a month. The prime minister also claimed that Mr Dobson's support would rise as soon as the media focused on policies rather than personalities - at the same time as Labour was launching an election broadcast nicknamed Frank: the Movie, which focuses on the candidate's personal qualities. Mr Livingstone's proposals for funding the tube with a bond scheme would mean delays and a \"millstone of debt\" for London, Mr Blair claimed. He said Mr Livingstone's introduction of congestion charges would cost drivers \u00a35 per day, or \u00a3100 a month. The prime minister's claim came on the day the London chamber of commerce, the RAC and the Freight Transport Association issued a joint warning of an \"angry backlash\" if congestion charges were brought in before significant improvements were made to public transport. \"While we do not oppose congestion charging in principle, motorists should be given high-quality public transport alternatives before it is put in place,\" said the chamber of commerce's chief executive, Simon Sperryn. Mr Livingstone, the former Labour MP and independent mayoral candidate, responded by claiming that the government's public-private partnership (PPP) for the modernisation of the underground, backed by Mr Dobson, could cost \u00a3100m in consultants' fees alone. \"The PPP consultants' gravy-train shows once again how vital it is that the future of the underground should be decided by London,\" Mr Livingstone said. Mr Dobson is the only candidate from the main parties not to back Mr Livingstone's call for \"London\" - and not the government - to decide future funding arrangements for the tube. Lending his support to Mr Dobson's ailing campaign - a poll last week put him third on 15%, behind Mr Livingstone and the Tory candidate, Steven Norris - Mr Blair claimed that once the media \"start looking at these policy questions there is only one candidate in this election\". \"Frank is not a media candidate,\" he added. \"He is not a showbusiness candidate, but he is a 24-hour-a-day man. He is the guy who will work night and day for these policies. He has never changed in the 20 years I have known him.\" Mr Dobson also mounted a fierce personal attack on Mr Livingstone. \"Strip away the chat-show talk, the gesture politics and the smarming up to every group he meets and you see what Londoners increasingly are seeing - that the emperor has no clothes.\" The Liberal Democrat candidate, Susan Kramer - who was not mentioned by Mr Blair or Mr Dobson - said that Labour still had not explained how they would finance their Underground modernisation programme. \"On the tube, Frank Dobson promises radical improvement by 2010, but he won't tell us how he will pay for it,\" she said. The four minutes of Frank: the Movie focus squarely on Mr Dobson as an individual, in an effort to illustrate his message that he would be his own man as mayor and not a Downing Street placeman, as his critics claim. The film is shot in a deliberately \"amateur\" style, mixing wobbly video footage with blurred, unposed still-photos, in order to present Mr Dobson as an unpolished, straight-talking candidate. Intercutting between snapshots of London streets and footage of the candidate speaking straight to camera, the broadcast outlines Mr Dobson's policies on transport, jobs, playgrounds, health and drugs. Following press reports that he has been encouraged to swear in order to show his passion, Mr Dobson uses the word \"damn\" in a pre-watershed broadcast, when talking about the tube. The word \"Labour\" is not spoken, and appears on screen only once. The broadcast will be shown in the London area tomorrow on BBC1 and ITV, following early evening news programmes.",

But the Spanish foreign minister, Abel Matutes, cautioned that the latest settlement did not mean that Spain had abandoned its claim to Gibraltar. \"It does not address the sovereignty question,\" he said. The foreign secretary, Robin Cook, said he hoped it would \"improve the climate of dialogue\" over the tiny outpost of 28,000 people which Britain has held since the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. \"We've achieved it without surrendering a single dot on our commitment that Gibraltar is British territory,\" Mr Cook said. Gibraltar, usually unhappily caught between the two, also expressed contentment with the new arrangements. Gibraltar's chief minister, Peter Caru ana, told a special meeting of the assembly yesterday that the agreement would allow co-operation between the Gibraltar and Spanish police to help fight crime. Spain, which has launched military actions over the centuries aimed at winning back the Rock, had become alarmed that Gibraltar had shown signs of increasing autonomy. At present it is a British overseas territory. Anxious to prevent direct ties between Gibraltar and the European Union, Spain had stacked up a series of obstacles, and had been blocking EU directives. It had also refused to deal directly with the local authority in Gibraltar. Almost all these problems have now been resolved. The settlement, which Britain and Spain have been negotiating behind the scenes for the last eight months, means that: \u00b7 Gibraltarian documents, diplomatic contacts and financial and judicial decisions that extend outside its territory have to be rubber-stamped by Britain, an authority Spain recognises. \u00b7 Gibraltarians, who faced problems travelling around Europe, will now have their identity cards accepted. \u00b7 Spain will also recognise identity cards issued to Gibraltar residents, after the local authority agreed to clarify the territory's status on the cards. \u00b7 The Spanish police, who had accused Gibraltar of being a haven for traffickers, will work more closely with the Gibraltar police. \u00b7 Marriages and divorces in Gibraltar will be recognised throughout the European Union. \u00b7 Banks and other financial institutions in Gibraltar will be able to spread their services throughout the European Union. \u00b7 To get round Spanish objections to direct links with Gibraltar, communications between Gibraltar and Spain will be conducted between a \"post-box\" at the Foreign Office in London. The big remaining problem is over the lack of any representation by Gibraltar in the European parliament. At present, Gibraltar has what one Foreign Office spokeswoman described as \"two-thirds membership\" of the EU. Spanish objections mean Gibraltarians cannot vote in European Union elections or have a seat in the European parliament. Moves are under way to try to resolve this, possibly within the next year. Relations between Britain and Spain are relatively good and the contentious issue of sovereignty could gradually become irrelevant under the common umbrella of the European Union. An important side effect of the deal is that many EU directives that had been blocked by Spain in protest over Gibraltar will be implemented soon. Equally important, the settlement should make it easier for Britain to integrate into the EU's system of police and judicial cooperation, under the Schengen agreement that allows free movement without passports round the continental part of the European Union. EU officials were particularly pleased because the deal clears the way for implementation of EU-wide rules on cross-border company take-overs which were agreed by the 15 EU nations last June after a decade of haggling, but have since been snagged by the Gibraltar issue. The deal was negotiated between Britain's ambassador to the European Union, Sir Stephen Wall, and his Spanish counterpart, Francesco Javier Elorza.

All you have to do is drop off your favourite ovenproof dish in the morning, pick it up on the way home from work and then heat it up. Sneaky, yes, but also surely a symptom of the new habit of staying in the office until what used to be called suppertime, and then expecting to have time to knock up a chichi meal for your friends. </p> <p>One forward-thinking delicatessen can't fill an ever-widening gap in the market, but maybe the internet can. Leapingsalmon.com, the brainchild of Cambridge graduate net entrepreneurs James Marshall and Peter Kenyon, is cooking to go: an upscale takeaway/dinner party hybrid, which blends the laziness of ordering in with the look-aren't-I-clever benefits of cooking. </p> <p>All you have to do is log on to the website by 12 noon (or the day before, if you're out of central London), choose a dish (say, melanzane and taleggio ravioli in a butter and pine kernel sauce), part with around \u00a315 to \u00a320 via credit card, and a \"coolbag\" will be delivered - to your office by 6pm, or your home between 6pm and 7.30pm. </p> <p>The coolbag (in boy-friendly steel grey; one tester observed, \"You could say you were carrying your hard disk in it\") arrives ready for you to take home, and contains all the ingredients you need - even things like butter, lemon, sugar, and a recipe to make the meal in less than 30 minutes. </p> <p>Given a fridge stuffed full of gorgeous fresh produce, knocking up a meal in 30 minutes is no problem, but there are always days when stocks run low through lack of time. The truly time-saving part of the leapingsalmon.com idea is being able to produce food (or more specifically, food that isn't pasta and tomato sauce) without having to shop. </p> <p>For me - and I'd hazard a guess that this is normal - the difference between everyday supper and dinner-party food is that the former revolves around whatever is in the fridge, whereas the latter revolves around what I think everyone would like to eat. But when time constraints mean that food will have to be bought on the way home from work, or at lunchtime, any recipe which requires an ingredient that Sainsbury's aren't likely to have in stock has to be struck off the list. </p> <p>The words \"now available in many specialist stores\" have me turning the page double quick. Moreover, the idiot-proof tone of the leapingsalmon.com recipes give the impression that the target customer is the type who thinks a well-stocked larder means having two bottles of Absolut vodka.</p> <p>So on test day, I bypassed the tetchy after-work supermarket crowds and arrived home an hour earlier and considerably less frazzled. Leapingsalmon.com grades its meals from easy to difficult, so I had opted to try out an easy recipe (chargrilled salmon in lemon and watercress sauce with spinach roulade, roasted peppers and new potatoes) and a difficult one (roast breast of duck in caramelised red onion and port sauce with French beans, carrots, and mashed potato infused with truffle oil). </p> <p>Dinner a la leapingsalmon. com is a totally different kettle of fish to \"proper\" cooking. It felt more like a chemistry experiment than making supper. There were endless tiny plastic boxes: the meat was pre-sliced, the vegetables trimmed, the creme fraiche measured out. All the difficult bits had been done - the salmon kit contained ready-made stock, wine and cornflour mixture, while the duck featured a tub of port gravy. </p> <p>In fact, the most taxing moment of the whole enterprise was brought upon myself when I took all the boxes for both meals out of the coolbags, then couldn't work out which tubs went with which recipe. </p> <p>Once I had that licked, it honestly couldn't have been easier. In fact it was so easy that I got a bit bored.

      "bodyText": "There is a delicatessen not too far from where I live where the lasagne is legendary. The secret? They make it in your own dish, so it looks like you cooked it. All you have to do is drop off your favourite ovenproof dish in the morning, pick it up on the way home from work and then heat it up. Sneaky, yes, but also surely a symptom of the new habit of staying in the office until what used to be called suppertime, and then expecting to have time to knock up a chichi meal for your friends. One forward-thinking delicatessen can't fill an ever-widening gap in the market, but maybe the internet can. Leapingsalmon.com, the brainchild of Cambridge graduate net entrepreneurs James Marshall and Peter Kenyon, is cooking to go: an upscale takeaway/dinner party hybrid, which blends the laziness of ordering in with the look-aren't-I-clever benefits of cooking. All you have to do is log on to the website by 12 noon (or the day before, if you're out of central London), choose a dish (say, melanzane and taleggio ravioli in a butter and pine kernel sauce), part with around \u00a315 to \u00a320 via credit card, and a \"coolbag\" will be delivered - to your office by 6pm, or your home between 6pm and 7.30pm. The coolbag (in boy-friendly steel grey; one tester observed, \"You could say you were carrying your hard disk in it\") arrives ready for you to take home, and contains all the ingredients you need - even things like butter, lemon, sugar, and a recipe to make the meal in less than 30 minutes. Given a fridge stuffed full of gorgeous fresh produce, knocking up a meal in 30 minutes is no problem, but there are always days when stocks run low through lack of time. The truly time-saving part of the leapingsalmon.com idea is being able to produce food (or more specifically, food that isn't pasta and tomato sauce) without having to shop. For me - and I'd hazard a guess that this is normal - the difference between everyday supper and dinner-party food is that the former revolves around whatever is in the fridge, whereas the latter revolves around what I think everyone would like to eat. But when time constraints mean that food will have to be bought on the way home from work, or at lunchtime, any recipe which requires an ingredient that Sainsbury's aren't likely to have in stock has to be struck off the list. The words \"now available in many specialist stores\" have me turning the page double quick. Moreover, the idiot-proof tone of the leapingsalmon.com recipes give the impression that the target customer is the type who thinks a well-stocked larder means having two bottles of Absolut vodka. So on test day, I bypassed the tetchy after-work supermarket crowds and arrived home an hour earlier and considerably less frazzled. Leapingsalmon.com grades its meals from easy to difficult, so I had opted to try out an easy recipe (chargrilled salmon in lemon and watercress sauce with spinach roulade, roasted peppers and new potatoes) and a difficult one (roast breast of duck in caramelised red onion and port sauce with French beans, carrots, and mashed potato infused with truffle oil). Dinner a la leapingsalmon. com is a totally different kettle of fish to \"proper\" cooking. It felt more like a chemistry experiment than making supper. There were endless tiny plastic boxes: the meat was pre-sliced, the vegetables trimmed, the creme fraiche measured out. All the difficult bits had been done - the salmon kit contained ready-made stock, wine and cornflour mixture, while the duck featured a tub of port gravy. In fact, the most taxing moment of the whole enterprise was brought upon myself when I took all the boxes for both meals out of the coolbags, then couldn't work out which tubs went with which recipe. Once I had that licked, it honestly couldn't have been easier. In fact it was so easy that I got a bit bored. The duck was actually no more difficult than the salmon - for example, the mash with truffle oil was a matter of tipping the ready-made mash into a saucepan and stirring in the oil. The chopping board barely had a walk-on part. Each meal was ready in well under the 30 minutes promised. When it came to the moment of reckoning, the duck looked pretty on the plate, I thought, what with the restaurant-esque caramelised onions and the pretty, leafy baby carrots, although my testers (who knew I hadn't \"really\" cooked it) were less than overawed. The salmon, on the other hand, looked decidedly underwhelming: calling it chargrilled is a bit misleading - unless you have a griddle pan (and it doesn't seem to me that these kits are aimed at the griddle-owning cook) it is baked instead. The duck and salmon themselves were very good quality, although it was the sugar-sweet carrots and crunchy French beans served with the duck that garnered the highest praise. The pre-prepared mash didn't fool anyone. \"A bit like space food,\" commented my eagle-eyed testers. The duck was undoubtedly a suitably impressive meal for \u00a319.90 (for two generous portions) and 25 minutes' work.

      "body": "<p>Eccentric, outspoken, lonely, loony and highly strung: all words used by friends and neighbours to describe Tony Martin, the farmer convicted yesterday of the murder of a 16-year-old boy who broke into his isolated farmhouse one night last August.</p> <p>Many people in the Fen villages near Emneth in Norfolk believed the \"weird\" farmer to be harmless. But others, who had heard him espouse his hatred for burglars and what he would do with them if he caught them, had taken to giving Martin a wide berth.</p> <p>Apart from thieves, Martin's pet hate was Gypsies. Norwich crown court heard that the farmer had talked of putting Gypsies in the middle of a field, surrounding it with barbed wire and machine gunning them. Fred Barras, the boy he killed, was both of these things: a Gypsy and a thief.</p> <p>Martin - said to wear only navy blue - lived alone, nurturing apples along with his deep hatreds. One look at his bizarre home, appropriately named Bleak House, gives a fair insight into the character of the man.</p> <p>The house, like something from a Grimms' fairy tale, is covered in creepers and ivy. Doors are hanging off, a broken lavatory sits outside the front door, beside it is a moss-covered Rover 2000 and a long-discarded washing machine.</p> <p><b> Rottweilers</b><br></p> <p>When the jury visited the house police were forced to clear sackloads of rubble from the floor, point out booby traps on the landing and cut back swaths of the dangerous hogweed plant just to make it safe. Martin and his three rottweilers, Otto, Bruno and Daniel, lived in the middle of this chaos.</p> <p>Upstairs, antiques were locked away in two rooms while Martin fixed up a TV and a small lamp that burned 24 hours a day in another. It was here that he slept fully clothed, with his boots on and his well-oiled pump-action shotgun by his bedside. Waiting.</p> <p>Tony Martin was born in 1944 in the Cambridgeshire village of Wisbech, just a few miles from Bleak House. His father Walter was a wealthy fruit farmer who married Hilary Mitcham, also from a farming family.</p> <p>Their son was privately educated but not too bright academically. He attended Glebe House, Hunstanton, where he won a prize for sports, and Copethorpe Park in Oxfordshire.</p> <p>A loner from an early age, Martin preferred quieter pursuits such as making models. Even now, he collects teddy bears, bringing one with him to court every day.</p> <p>Guns were always around the house: cartridges were kept in pots and drawers and every other place but young Tony, his mother claims, did not take to shooting like his father and brother Robin.</p> <p>\"He didn't really like the idea of killing. He didn't like animals to be killed. When he got his own place, which is now a bit of a mess admittedly, he wanted it to be a bird sanctuary,\" she said.</p> <p>After leaving school at 17, Martin travelled the globe working on cruise liners. He spent time in Australia, working on sheep farms, and New Zealand, where he was jailed for being an illegal alien.</p> <p>After a spell on the Scottish oil rigs, the death of his grandfather brought him back to the Emneth area where he ran a pig farm on his parents' property.</p> <p>It was not until he was 35 that Martin got a place of his own: he inherited Bleak House from his aunt Gladys and uncle Arthur. At first he had grand plans for the red-brick Victorian property but a lack of money, then will, allowed it to become dilapidated and almost uninhabitable.</p> <p>Martin did, however, buy more of the surrounding land over time and now has a valuable 350 acres with an orchard of low trees growing apples, pears and plums.</p> <p>Martin had a few friends and struck up a friendship with Helen Lilley, the owner of the nearby Marmion House hotel he fled to after the killing. His best friend, Terry Howard, says Martin became lonely in later life.</p> <p>\"He would never admit to that, but I think he was. He would turn up at all times, a stone would rattle at my window at 7.30am and he would say, 'Are you going to let me in for a coffee?' \"</p> <p>Howard said his friend was \"weird\" and at times could be \"hard work\". He said: \"I would not call him a rebel, but he's always been his own man. At times it could make him a pain in the arse.\"</p> <p><b> Trinkets</b><br></p> <p>During his years at Bleak House, Martin became more and more convinced that he was a target for burglars. He told the court that not long after moving in he had arrived home one night to catch a burglar stuffing a pillowcase with trinkets, which he dropped when Martin chased him.</p> <p>He said that over the years electrical items, tools and tractor batteries had been stolen. In March last year, a grandfather clock was taken and in May he lost a table, a bureau and two chests of drawers.</p> <p>Martin claims he became more and more frustrated by police inaction over the burglaries but police sources say they are not even sure that all the incidents took place.</p> <p>Despite claims by Martin's friends and his mother that he hated shooting, he was involved in a number of incidents with guns. In June 1976, the farmer is alleged to have gone to a friend's house in some distress and brandished a first world war revolver: a shot was fired and a pigeon killed. In December 1987 he had an argument at his brother's house over some property. Martin is said to have got very upset and used a shotgun to smash windows.</p> <p>In 1994 he had his shotgun certificate revoked after he found a man scrumping for apples in his orchard and shot a hole in the back of his vehicle. After the shooting of Fred Barras and Brendan Fearon, police recovered an old rusty shotgun from Martin's garage: another gun he should not have had without a shotgun certificate.

      "bodyText": "Eccentric, outspoken, lonely, loony and highly strung: all words used by friends and neighbours to describe Tony Martin, the farmer convicted yesterday of the murder of a 16-year-old boy who broke into his isolated farmhouse one night last August. Many people in the Fen villages near Emneth in Norfolk believed the \"weird\" farmer to be harmless. But others, who had heard him espouse his hatred for burglars and what he would do with them if he caught them, had taken to giving Martin a wide berth. Apart from thieves, Martin's pet hate was Gypsies. Norwich crown court heard that the farmer had talked of putting Gypsies in the middle of a field, surrounding it with barbed wire and machine gunning them. Fred Barras, the boy he killed, was both of these things: a Gypsy and a thief. Martin - said to wear only navy blue - lived alone, nurturing apples along with his deep hatreds. One look at his bizarre home, appropriately named Bleak House, gives a fair insight into the character of the man. The house, like something from a Grimms' fairy tale, is covered in creepers and ivy. Doors are hanging off, a broken lavatory sits outside the front door, beside it is a moss-covered Rover 2000 and a long-discarded washing machine. Rottweilers When the jury visited the house police were forced to clear sackloads of rubble from the floor, point out booby traps on the landing and cut back swaths of the dangerous hogweed plant just to make it safe. Martin and his three rottweilers, Otto, Bruno and Daniel, lived in the middle of this chaos. Upstairs, antiques were locked away in two rooms while Martin fixed up a TV and a small lamp that burned 24 hours a day in another. It was here that he slept fully clothed, with his boots on and his well-oiled pump-action shotgun by his bedside. Waiting. Tony Martin was born in 1944 in the Cambridgeshire village of Wisbech, just a few miles from Bleak House. His father Walter was a wealthy fruit farmer who married Hilary Mitcham, also from a farming family. Their son was privately educated but not too bright academically. He attended Glebe House, Hunstanton, where he won a prize for sports, and Copethorpe Park in Oxfordshire. A loner from an early age, Martin preferred quieter pursuits such as making models. Even now, he collects teddy bears, bringing one with him to court every day. Guns were always around the house: cartridges were kept in pots and drawers and every other place but young Tony, his mother claims, did not take to shooting like his father and brother Robin. \"He didn't really like the idea of killing. He didn't like animals to be killed. When he got his own place, which is now a bit of a mess admittedly, he wanted it to be a bird sanctuary,\" she said. After leaving school at 17, Martin travelled the globe working on cruise liners. He spent time in Australia, working on sheep farms, and New Zealand, where he was jailed for being an illegal alien. After a spell on the Scottish oil rigs, the death of his grandfather brought him back to the Emneth area where he ran a pig farm on his parents' property. It was not until he was 35 that Martin got a place of his own: he inherited Bleak House from his aunt Gladys and uncle Arthur. At first he had grand plans for the red-brick Victorian property but a lack of money, then will, allowed it to become dilapidated and almost uninhabitable. Martin did, however, buy more of the surrounding land over time and now has a valuable 350 acres with an orchard of low trees growing apples, pears and plums. Martin had a few friends and struck up a friendship with Helen Lilley, the owner of the nearby Marmion House hotel he fled to after the killing. His best friend, Terry Howard, says Martin became lonely in later life. \"He would never admit to that, but I think he was. He would turn up at all times, a stone would rattle at my window at 7.30am and he would say, 'Are you going to let me in for a coffee?' \" Howard said his friend was \"weird\" and at times could be \"hard work\". He said: \"I would not call him a rebel, but he's always been his own man. At times it could make him a pain in the arse.\" Trinkets During his years at Bleak House, Martin became more and more convinced that he was a target for burglars. He told the court that not long after moving in he had arrived home one night to catch a burglar stuffing a pillowcase with trinkets, which he dropped when Martin chased him. He said that over the years electrical items, tools and tractor batteries had been stolen. In March last year, a grandfather clock was taken and in May he lost a table, a bureau and two chests of drawers. Martin claims he became more and more frustrated by police inaction over the burglaries but police sources say they are not even sure that all the incidents took place. Despite claims by Martin's friends and his mother that he hated shooting, he was involved in a number of incidents with guns. In June 1976, the farmer is alleged to have gone to a friend's house in some distress and brandished a first world war revolver: a shot was fired and a pigeon killed. In December 1987 he had an argument at his brother's house over some property. Martin is said to have got very upset and used a shotgun to smash windows. In 1994 he had his shotgun certificate revoked after he found a man scrumping for apples in his orchard and shot a hole in the back of his vehicle. After the shooting of Fred Barras and Brendan Fearon, police recovered an old rusty shotgun from Martin's garage: another gun he should not have had without a shotgun certificate. The guns, Martin said, were for shooting pigeons. Guns are part of the culture in the Norfolk area. Farmers use them every day and many local people keep them not just for hunting but protection. As one woman put it: \"They wouldn't hesitate to use it.\" Here, there is an air of paranoia, a fear of the intruder. Walk around the villages of Emneth and Emneth Hungate and that fear is more than palpable. Signs on lamp-posts and fences warn that \"guard dogs are loose\", \"this is a homewatch area\", that \"this is private property\" and that \"scrap dealers are not welcome\". NFU Mutual figures show Norfolk as having the highest incidence of rural crime, particularly burglaries and the theft of tractors and trailers. Emneth has policing difficulties because of its situation on the borders of Norfolk and Cambridgeshire, making it a target for the travelling criminal. Consequently, most people keep dogs, positioning their kennels right in front of their homes. Farms in Norfolk have long attracted travelling people, who come to pick the different fruits of the season. As work became less certain elsewhere, they began to settle. To Martin, they were nothing but \"light-fingered pykies\" and \"bastards\". A committal hearing heard that he believed \"Hitler was right\" in his policies towards Gypsies. His views would have pleased his uncle by marriage, Andrew Fountaine, a founder of the National Front. Martin was a regular visitor to Fountaine's home, at Narford Hall, near Swaffham, Norfolk, not far from Bleak House. It was here that the fascist leader organised regular Aryan summer camps, which prompted the Home Office on one occasion to refuse entry permission to a number of continental fascists. Fountaine had warned: \"Within a generation, the Norfolkman, his culture, purpose, and ethnic succession will be biologically extinguished.\" Views such as these are not just the preserve of the wider Martin family; they still prevail on the Fens today.

Shopkeepers seem to clam up at the mere mention of the word Galatasaray, as if it is some Pandora's Box which must remain shut. </p> <p>I am ready to give up, but decide - somewhat tentatively - to venture into the bustling Halkevi Community Centre, home of London's large Kurdish population, and a large number of die-hard Galatasaray fans.</p> <p>When I enter there are about 40 people sitting around tables, which are laid out in a bingo-style horizontal formation. In the background a crowd of elderly gentleman wearing faded black suits are watching the Kurdish TV channel Medya. Most of them are smoking. The younger lads prefer to jostle round the table-tennis and pool tables.</p> <p>It looks like any other community centre. There's even a place to buy soft drinks and flavoured tea, and a stage, decked out with speakers and a keyboard, for big occasions.</p> <p>But then you see the pictures of the founders of the PKK (the Kurdistan Workers Party), with the only surviving member Adullah Ocalan (or Apo as he is affectionately known) taking pride of place, and you realise these people are even more passionate about their politics than their football.</p> <p>Everyone is immediately friendly, and it's not long before there is a crowd of people around my table, offering their opinions.</p> <p>Some are aggressive, and see Uefa's decision to ban Galatasaray fan as racist. \"What Uefa did was side with the stronger economic government,\" says a bearded man in his forties named Huseyin. \"Why is it that two men were stabbed but the whole country is punished? </p> <p>\"In Turkey, it's not OK for everybody to drink large amounts,\" he continued. \"When somebody drinks and does what the English did, ordinary people see it as wrong. That's why they reacted.\"</p> <p>Others talk confidently about how they've obtained tickets in the home section of Elland Road from their English friends, and would go even though they expected trouble.</p> <p>One man - who gives his name as Haci - says: \"I think Leeds are very angry, and there will be trouble. But we've got some mad supporters. They would go to Elland Road even if they knew they were going to die. Some of them are very, very fanatical.\" </p> <p>And if these fanatical supporters were provoked, I asked? \"We go there and if anybody says something they will be chopped up,\" he replies in Turkish, his face showing no emotion. </p> <p>But most Galatasaray fans say they would watch the game at home. \"Whoever goes is looking for trouble,\" said Ilyas Ozsoy, a well-spoken man in his late thirties, \"Why go at all? - it's on the television.\"</p> <p>\"Both countries have over-reacted,\" he continues. \"It's a football match.

      "bodyText": "My plan, when I board the train to Stoke Newington, North London, seems simple enough: find the Galatasaray social club, and - after working my way in with a glass or two of Lezzo tea, or whatever else the regulars are drinking - get the Turkish reaction to the murders of the two Leeds fans, and the maelstrom surrounding it. The trouble is that 45 minutes later, despite plodding up and down the High Street, I am still no nearer to finding the place. I walk past endless kebab-selling cafes and cash'n'carries - one of which is happy to boast: \"our prices are straight because we are straight\" - but my enquiries about the club are met with suspicion; a shrug of the shoulders and a firm \"I don't know\". Shopkeepers seem to clam up at the mere mention of the word Galatasaray, as if it is some Pandora's Box which must remain shut. I am ready to give up, but decide - somewhat tentatively - to venture into the bustling Halkevi Community Centre, home of London's large Kurdish population, and a large number of die-hard Galatasaray fans. When I enter there are about 40 people sitting around tables, which are laid out in a bingo-style horizontal formation. In the background a crowd of elderly gentleman wearing faded black suits are watching the Kurdish TV channel Medya. Most of them are smoking. The younger lads prefer to jostle round the table-tennis and pool tables. It looks like any other community centre. There's even a place to buy soft drinks and flavoured tea, and a stage, decked out with speakers and a keyboard, for big occasions. But then you see the pictures of the founders of the PKK (the Kurdistan Workers Party), with the only surviving member Adullah Ocalan (or Apo as he is affectionately known) taking pride of place, and you realise these people are even more passionate about their politics than their football. Everyone is immediately friendly, and it's not long before there is a crowd of people around my table, offering their opinions. Some are aggressive, and see Uefa's decision to ban Galatasaray fan as racist. \"What Uefa did was side with the stronger economic government,\" says a bearded man in his forties named Huseyin. \"Why is it that two men were stabbed but the whole country is punished? \"In Turkey, it's not OK for everybody to drink large amounts,\" he continued. \"When somebody drinks and does what the English did, ordinary people see it as wrong. That's why they reacted.\" Others talk confidently about how they've obtained tickets in the home section of Elland Road from their English friends, and would go even though they expected trouble. One man - who gives his name as Haci - says: \"I think Leeds are very angry, and there will be trouble. But we've got some mad supporters. They would go to Elland Road even if they knew they were going to die. Some of them are very, very fanatical.\" And if these fanatical supporters were provoked, I asked? \"We go there and if anybody says something they will be chopped up,\" he replies in Turkish, his face showing no emotion. But most Galatasaray fans say they would watch the game at home. \"Whoever goes is looking for trouble,\" said Ilyas Ozsoy, a well-spoken man in his late thirties, \"Why go at all? - it's on the television.\" \"Both countries have over-reacted,\" he continues. \"It's a football match. Some trouble happened in Turkey. Two people died. Nobody's happy about it - but it's just a football match, it's only sport.\" Another fan, a Kurdish teenager named Denis says he is desperate to go to Elland Road, as he wants to lay red flowers as a tribute to the two dead men. \"I also wish that both teams would come together before kick-off and shake hands to show that football can rise above nationalism,\" he continues. \"But I'm scared. Since the deaths of the Leeds fans there have been several attacks. Last week a Kurdish guy from Northern Iraq was beaten up in London by a gang of white youths because they thought he was Turkish. In that climate nobody is safe.\" Not surprisingly the talk frequently turns to politics. Many are deeply suspicious of the Turkish government and hope that if Leeds' fans attack anyone it will be the hated special forces that are accompanying the Galatasaray team. Others think that the government might have bribed people to confess to the killings of the Leeds men to quell English outrage - and in a few months time those same men will be released. But most fans don't have time for conspiracy theories. They just want the tonight's game - and the thousands of column inches that have accompanied it - to be forgotten about, so they can live their lives as normal. Eventually we finish up, and two of the men offer to take me to the Galatasaray Social Club further up the High Street. I soon realise why I wasn't able to find it before: it's now called the Rainbow club. The owner explains that after the deaths of Christopher Loftus and Kevin Speight they hastily changed its name because they feared that English supporters would be out for revenge. So the following morning they whitened the board outside the club, and then painted in the word Gokkusagi (rainbow) in red paint over the word Galatasaray. \"So far we haven't had any trouble,\" he confides. \"But I do worry about what will happen after the night's match.\" \"Even though I support Galatasaray I don't want them to win because if that happens the trouble will escalate.\" He pauses to think. \"Well, maybe 1-0 to Leeds would be a good score to satisfy everybody.

      "bodyText": "The veteran Labour leftwinger, Dennis Skinner MP, last night launched a scathing attack on Ken Livingstone when he denounced the independent frontrunner for London mayor as an egotistical prima donna and a liar whom voters could not trust. The move came as Mr Livingstone, who has been expelled from Labour's ranks for his independent bid for mayor, moved to strengthen his position by urging his supporters to help Greens get elected to the new Greater London assembly (GLA). With just two weeks to go to polling day that move - welcomed by the Greens who are offering reciprocal support - may be more than offset by the onslaught of Mr Skinner, for many years a Livingstone ally on Labour's ruling national executive committee. In an impassioned intervention in support of Frank Dobson - \"a bloke and a half,\" he called him - Mr Skinner singled out as the former GLC leader's worst betrayal the pledges he broke, not to MPs or ministers but to constituency activists in Brent East. They had fought for him \"like tigers\" when Mr Livingstone's majority had been small and he had let them down. \"He tells them he's going to be the Labour candidate, then he lies to them. To me that's as low as you can get,\" said the MP for Bolsover. Mr Dobson was \"not a prima donna ... not someone with an ego as big as a house\". Mayor Livingstone would \"hit the headlines, but you'll never be able to trust him because he's broken his pledge and his loyalty to his party\". The former miner contrasted the loyalty to Labour of people like Tony Benn and himself with defections by the likes of Mr Livingstone and the miners' leader, Arthur Scargill. \"The personality cult of the ego does not work down a coal mine and it does not work in the Labour party,\" said Mr Skinner. The savagery of his speech overshadowed pro-Dobson speeches by cabinet ministers, Mo Mowlam and John Reid, at a Dobson rally in Westminster where the official Labour candidate, trailing with 15% to Mr Livingstone's 49%, came close to admitting he may lose. \"If we win we win, if we don't we don't. We have all lost before and we will win again,\" Mr Dobson told supporters.",

Their candidate for mayor, Darren Johnson, who is also at the top of the Green party list for the GLA, has already urged his side to give their second preferences to Mr Livingstone. He may need them in the decisive second round if his support stays below the necessary 50%, or falls still further. The Greens took 7.7% of the London vote in the 1999 Euro polls and elected two MEPs, Jean Lambert and Caroline Lucas, in the wider south-east. They hope to elect two GLA members, Mr Johnson and his deputy, Victoria Anderson.</p> <p>Mr Dobson, who will make a personalised plea to Londoners in a campaign broadcast on TV tonight, was quick to retaliate against a rival he regards as in it for himself, not for London. He moved to undermine \"Red Ken's\" Green credentials.</p> <p>The Dobson team issued two quotes from an interview which Mr Livingstone gave to Open Eye magazine in which he allegedly said he favours genetically modified food - a \"lesser evil\", compared with \"saturating the world with chemicals\".</p> <p>Asked about biotechnology as a means of increasing agricultural output, he had also observed that \"people had exactly the same qualms about antibiotics when they started, they had exactly the same qualms about breeding selectively hundreds of years ago\".</p> <p>Mr Dobson's broadcast says he wants to maker London \"safer, fairer and cleaner.\" But he will warn voters that their choice will be binding for four years. \"It won't be like buying something from a shop and then taking it back and asking for your money back.\"</p> <p>Steve Norris, the Tory candidate, who also claims he can beat the frontrunmner on second preferences, screened his election broadcast on two giant screens in central London last night - a first he claimed (see Letters).</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ken Livingstone yesterday launched another tactical gamble to strengthen his bid to become London's first elected mayor when he urged his supporters to use their votes to ensure that the Greens get seats in the new Greater London assembly. The former GLC leader, who has been expelled from Labour's ranks after declaring an independent candidacy, did not abandon his old party entirely. He urged Londoners to prevent a Tory revival - \"I can't think of anything worse\" - and to give their second preference votes to Frank Dobson, Labour's official candidate. They should also vote Labour in the 14 geographical constituencies which make up the bulk of the 25-strong GLA with whom the elected mayor will have to work closely. But in a bid for tactical Green support the Brent East MP also advised using the fourth vote on May 4 to help the Greens win some of the 11 London-wide top-up seats available in the new proportional voting system, designed to widen representation. That would help \"make sure that protection of the environment is systematically pursued across all fields of the GLA's work ... a strong Green contingent in the assembly is vital to clean up London,\" Mr Livingstone said. The Greens were delighted by the move. Their candidate for mayor, Darren Johnson, who is also at the top of the Green party list for the GLA, has already urged his side to give their second preferences to Mr Livingstone. He may need them in the decisive second round if his support stays below the necessary 50%, or falls still further. The Greens took 7.7% of the London vote in the 1999 Euro polls and elected two MEPs, Jean Lambert and Caroline Lucas, in the wider south-east. They hope to elect two GLA members, Mr Johnson and his deputy, Victoria Anderson. Mr Dobson, who will make a personalised plea to Londoners in a campaign broadcast on TV tonight, was quick to retaliate against a rival he regards as in it for himself, not for London. He moved to undermine \"Red Ken's\" Green credentials. The Dobson team issued two quotes from an interview which Mr Livingstone gave to Open Eye magazine in which he allegedly said he favours genetically modified food - a \"lesser evil\", compared with \"saturating the world with chemicals\". Asked about biotechnology as a means of increasing agricultural output, he had also observed that \"people had exactly the same qualms about antibiotics when they started, they had exactly the same qualms about breeding selectively hundreds of years ago\". Mr Dobson's broadcast says he wants to maker London \"safer, fairer and cleaner.\" But he will warn voters that their choice will be binding for four years. \"It won't be like buying something from a shop and then taking it back and asking for your money back.\" Steve Norris, the Tory candidate, who also claims he can beat the frontrunmner on second preferences, screened his election broadcast on two giant screens in central London last night - a first he claimed (see Letters).",

The Commons social security committee said the contracting out of medical eligibility tests to a private firm, the Sema Group, had raised suspicions that \"standards are coming second to profitability\". \"If this is happening, it is not only unfair, but it is also an inexcusable waste of taxpayers' money,\" the committee said in a report published today. Since Sema - which had no previous experience of medical operations - took over in 1998, the number of medical tests carried out to check claimants were really eligible for benefits had dropped sharply. The government said that the fall was due to the better targeting of tests. However the committee said the there were concerns that the way the Sema's \u00a3300 million contract was drawn up had given an \"in-built incentive\" to issue more \"paper\" approvals for benefits claims and carry out fewer actual tests. The MPs called on social security secretary Alistair Darling now to renegotiate the contract with Sema to tighten up its provisions. \"The inference could be drawn that Sema is profiteering, although we note their insistence that they do not use this method to increase profits,\" the report said. \"But what is entirely unacceptable and of particular concern is that the contractual system allows such a suspicion to be possible. \"We recommend that the contract be renegotiated in such a way as to ensure that there can be no question of profits being increased as a result of a policy which could cost the taxpayer millions of pounds through the payment of benefits which should not be made.\" The committee also expressed concern that doctors carrying out the tests were not consistently treating claimants with the level of professionalism they were entitled to expect. Complaints included uncomfortable and painful examinations, rude and brusque treatment, inaccurate recording of information, unacceptably long waits for tests and appointments cancelled at short notice. The committee also criticised the \"cultural insensitivity\" of some doctors towards ethnic minority claimants, including in one case the reported \"racial stereotyping of Irish clients\" who were assumed to have a drink problem.",

      "bodyText": "Who buys wine on the internet, anyway? Online grocery shopping, I can understand - it saves you from the trolleys and the queues and the carrier bags that split. But off-licences are fairly calm, fairly safe places. Pop in for a bottle or two, scan the special offers, but plump for the chardonnay; boring, I know, but it slips down easily and it's never, well, wrong. Still, I log on in the interest of research and wonder where to start. There are a few names that I know, more that I don't, and there are some that are vaguely familiar from the shop shelves I pass on the way to the chardonnay. I know nothing about wine, but would never admit this in the local offie. Online, this isn't a problem. If you're someone who does know their wines, then you can dive right in. There are vintage charts, tasting notes . . . just tap in your favourite wine producer and 12 bottles of their finest will hit the doorstep the next day.

      "body": "<p>There are quite a few advantages to our new house - at least, there will be, when the builders have finally taken their leave and I can reclaim my worldly goods from storage. One of the least anticipated was discovering that by moving a few hundred yards along the road we've propelled ourselves into the catchment area for Tesco Direct.</p> <p>No longer would I have to listen enviously to friends describing how nice young men in blue and white vans dropped bags of freshly packed groceries at their doors. Now I too could summon the supermarket to my doorstep at the touch of a button or two. No more wrestling with defective trolleys, no more bribing compliance from my 18-month-old twin daughters with half the crisp counter and no more discovering decaying avocados nestling in a dark corner of the car weeks later.</p> <p>Surely online shopping was the embodiment of Tony Blair's new Britain: efficient, convenient and hi-tech? Well, yes and no. Grocery shopping online, although not as testing as a heaving supermarket on a Saturday mid-morning, nevertheless has its frustrations.</p> <p>For a start, it takes a long time. Much longer than I thought it would. In Tesco's case, its somewhat sluggish site seems as if it's in dire need of a double espresso. Maybe it feels that way because I'm more used to buying books from super-slick Amazon - a pastime that can empty your savings account faster than you can say: \"Add to basket.\" </p> <p>Conversely, on the Tesco site I regularly take a good hour to spend \u00a329.50. One reason is that, every so often, you lose connection and have to log in again. When this first happened I was sure the carefully selected contents of my basket had disappeared into to cyberspace to curdle and decay, but happily they were waiting for me on my return, minus the most recent addition of disposable cutlery.</p> <p>There were other downsides that I hadn't anticipated. Namely, no facility to rummage at the back of the babyleaf salad selection to haul out one wearing next week's sell-by date or, for that matter, any way of picking the least eccentrically shaped Maris Pipers. </p> <p>Also, although the site does offer information on some of the goods on offer, including ingredients and nutritional facts, it doesn't provide any cooking instructions. Given that my kitchen currently consists of a microwave, a kettle and toaster, this is crucial information. If the three-bean vegetarian chilli comes in a foil container, it's no good to me. What's more, I suspect that when my kitchen re-emerges from its reconstructive surgery, I'll be just as anxious to know if the macaroni cheese on offer is suitable for home freezing. All these things you can read on the packet in the shop, but not online.</p> <p>A further limitation, for now at least, is that net shopping is no good for bargain hunters. If you're one of those people who only buy the stuff that's three for the price of two, or promising 4,000 club card points, then, for the moment, it seems you are destined for actual, rather than virtual, shopping. </p> <p>And if you're just downright short of ideas or not particularly hungry, you're probably better off hopping in the car. They haven't yet produced virtual aisles and there's a distinct lack of pictures. As someone who's recently been plunged into the business of web publishing, I understand Tesco's dilemma all too well: mouth-watering pictures would be great, but would slow down the site even more. Nevertheless, a five-word description of an iced ring doughnut is never quite as enticing as seeing one in the flesh. Consequently, I never seem to buy quite enough in one \"trip\", which, given the flat fiver delivery charge, is very unsound economics.</p> <p>Despite the limitations of the service, however, I find myself drawn back week after week. I wouldn't say settling down in front of the Compaq with a nice glass of Rioja and the kids safely tucked up in bed is the most thrilling way to spend an evening, but I've had a lot worse. Next day, usually pretty much on cue (you choose a two-hour delivery slot), up roll those nice young men in their blue and white van, and with them comes a real sense of achievement. Not only have I done the groceries, but I too am modern, efficient and hi-tech.</p> <p>And just think: soon you'll be able to do it anywhere, from your mobile phone. In bus queues, in dentists' waiting rooms, at the theatre. And there's no doubt that shopping sites will get faster and faster, as chips become ever more powerful and servers more reliable. With all the time this will free up, I'll have to find something else to do. Maybe I'll go to the shops.</p> <p>\u0095 Justine Roberts runs www.mumsnet.com, a website offering product recommendations, chat and advice for parents of 0-10s.</p> <p><strong>'My nightmare is over'</strong></p> <p>The family trip to the supermarket used to be torture for Jonathan Rogers. But now that he's discovered online shopping, there's no turning back</p> <p>I used to quite enjoy going to the supermarket. When you're single and there's a Tesco Metro nearby open until 10pm, it's not too bad at all. Most of my groceries fitted into two bags, and being able to shop late at night seemed one of the best things about living in the city. And there was always the outside chance of meeting your soulmate among the broccoli and iceberg lettuce.</p> <p>Then (not at a supermarket, I should add) I met my girlfriend Lindsay and her 14-month-old son Kiran. Suddenly I was no longer shopping for a partner. </p> <p>What used to be a gentle trip - a magazine here, some butter there - became a full-on nightmare. Shopping with a child is a race against the clock; you have to be quick otherwise he gets bored and throws a tantrum, which is a cue for disapproving glances from childless shoppers. It's certainly not a pleasure, and after you have all the shopping you'll need for the next week, you are confronted with several queues from hell to choose from - and believe me, you will make the wrong choice. </p> <p>The express checkout is a distant memory. And the grief doesn't stop there; the miserable checkout staff, the struggle home with cheap bags and swollen fingers - the list goes on and on. So when a friend of mine told me about Tesco Direct, I was more than ready to listen.</p> <p>You choose all your groceries online, and the store picks them out for you and delivers them to your door for just \u00a35. It sounded too good to be true. Surely, I assumed, they were bound to supply you with the wrong items, fob you off with less-than-fresh food and, following the proud tradition of British deliveries, make you wait in all day on a Saturday. </p> <p>However, the desire to palm off my aisle misery on to someone else was too great and \u00a35 didn't seem much for that kind of peace of mind, so I went for it. With Kiran distracted by the Teletubbies, Lindsay and I navigated through the virtual store, got what we wanted, and paid by credit card. After this, we were given a selection of delivery dates and a choice of two-hour periods on those dates. The food duly arrived on time, it was fine, and I was converted.</p> <p>The store had got all the items right, and those that were out of stock were replaced with the next best thing (pink grapefruits became red, that kind of thing). Furthermore, we were able to order Thomas the Tank Engine ham slices for Kiran without the public humiliation. Another plus point was that, when shopping online, you tend to stick to a list, and so avoid buying those superfluous items that you convince yourself you absolutely have to have when you're there in person. </p> <p>Not being able to see what you're buying is a disadvantage, but the descriptions are good, and after a million trips you tend to know what everything looks like anyway. The store you choose from is the biggest in the area, so the selection is immense; mine is Colney Hatch, a huge hypermarket with 5,000 car spaces. A far cry from my Stroud Green Road Tesco Metro days.</p> <p>The only problems we have experienced are the usual ones associated with the internet - if you are logged on at the same time as too many other people, the servers can be slow. But at least when this happens you can put a record on, or make a coffee. And the one time I had to call the support line, I was given excellent and friendly advice by someone who had clearly gone to a different charm school from his till-operating colleagues. I have also been sent software that allows you to shop offline, thus saving on phone bills.</p> <p>Despite all this, internet shopping hasn't won me over completely. I still have anxieties, for example, about giving personal details over the web. (My girlfriend, meanwhile, is a serial online shopper who, she assures me, has never been ripped off.) There are still certain things I would prefer to buy in person, such as records and clothes. But for something soul-destroying like weekly food shopping, the net is a life-saver. Now, if only Ikea could do the same thing.</p> <p> <strong>The online supermarkets</strong></p> <p>www.tesco.co.uk</p> <p>The giant among online grocers, with more customers than any of its rivals. More than 100 stores, most in the south-east, currently take part in the TescoDirect scheme; by the end of the year, 90% of the population should be within reach of the electronic aisles. Choose from 20,000 product ranges - in-store special offers apply - and arrange a two-hour delivery slot. Some stores deliver on Sundays.</p> <p>www.sainsburys.co.uk</p> <p>Sainsbury's Orderline service offers around 15,000 of its in-store ranges online, although it's mostly customers within the M25 who are benefiting at present. The service will be shifting out of stores to dedicated picking centres this year, bringing it to more shoppers outside London. Next-day delivery is available; it costs \u00a35 a pop.</p> <p>www.waitrose.com</p> <p>Companies, rather than individuals, must sign up to this scheme, which charges nothing for delivery. No need to stay in waiting for the van either, as they drop the groceries at the office. Those without a car - or, indeed, a workplace - must make do with wine or fresh organics, which WaitroseDirect will send straight to your door within 48 hours.</p> <p>www.budgens.co.uk</p> <p>In a rebuff to the trend to serve south-east shoppers, Budgens Direct started its online service in its Runcorn heartland. The usual two-hour delivery slot applies, though customers must pay for groceries on arrival. Office deliveries, too; these don't incur the normal \u00a35 charge.</p> <p>www.marks-and-spencer.co.uk</p> <p>Not with the front-runners in the online shopping race, but offers a range of wines for home delivery, with the trademark returns policy. Gorgeous pictures of food abound on the site, though, and bosses recently announced their intention to expand to include some of their luxury food ranges. www.icelandfreeshop. com A pioneer of home shopping, and the only one to claim a nationwide service, covering 97% of the population. Delivery is free, but you must spend a minimum of \u00a340 and live within 10 miles of a store (three miles within the M25). GM-free, too. </p> <p>www.asda.co.uk</p> <p>Ventured into online shopping last year with asda@home in Croydon and Watford, but there are no details on their website. </p> <p>www.co-op.co.uk</p> <p>Big on banking, but short on food: stay-at-home shoppers are currently restricted to wines or domestic appliances.</p> <p>www.safeway.co.uk</p> <p>Still trialling EasiOrder in Basingstoke; a palm-sized organiser compiles and sends lists to the store.</p> <p>www.24-7.co.uk</p> <p>The online arm of Somerfield, not yet fully operational, promises 5,000 product lines and a large organic range, plus ordering through interactive TV.</p> <p>www.foodferry.co.uk</p> <p>Chuck away the loyalty cards, as foodferry will take your list and shop everywhere, and even unpack your groceries for you. Next-day delivery; London only, though.</p> <p>www.freshfood.co.uk</p> <p>The UK's biggest online organic store, with more than 4,500 lines. The owners promise that you can do your weekly shop here, so start with one of their boxes - fresh produce, meat or fish - and take your pick from the greens on offer. Delivery costs a fiver, and is only on Thursdays, though you can set up a regular food drop. </p> <p>www.organicsdirect. co.uk</p> <p>This site offers a box scheme which will see prime fruit and veg arriving on your doorstep from only \u00a312.95 including delivery. No meats yet, but breads, dairy and booze are covered. For an even speedier service, Londoners can try www. organicdelivery.co.uk.</p>",

And the one time I had to call the support line, I was given excellent and friendly advice by someone who had clearly gone to a different charm school from his till-operating colleagues. I have also been sent software that allows you to shop offline, thus saving on phone bills. Despite all this, internet shopping hasn't won me over completely. I still have anxieties, for example, about giving personal details over the web. (My girlfriend, meanwhile, is a serial online shopper who, she assures me, has never been ripped off.) There are still certain things I would prefer to buy in person, such as records and clothes. But for something soul-destroying like weekly food shopping, the net is a life-saver. Now, if only Ikea could do the same thing. The online supermarkets www.tesco.co.uk The giant among online grocers, with more customers than any of its rivals. More than 100 stores, most in the south-east, currently take part in the TescoDirect scheme; by the end of the year, 90% of the population should be within reach of the electronic aisles. Choose from 20,000 product ranges - in-store special offers apply - and arrange a two-hour delivery slot. Some stores deliver on Sundays. www.sainsburys.co.uk Sainsbury's Orderline service offers around 15,000 of its in-store ranges online, although it's mostly customers within the M25 who are benefiting at present. The service will be shifting out of stores to dedicated picking centres this year, bringing it to more shoppers outside London. Next-day delivery is available; it costs \u00a35 a pop. www.waitrose.com Companies, rather than individuals, must sign up to this scheme, which charges nothing for delivery. No need to stay in waiting for the van either, as they drop the groceries at the office. Those without a car - or, indeed, a workplace - must make do with wine or fresh organics, which WaitroseDirect will send straight to your door within 48 hours. www.budgens.co.uk In a rebuff to the trend to serve south-east shoppers, Budgens Direct started its online service in its Runcorn heartland. The usual two-hour delivery slot applies, though customers must pay for groceries on arrival. Office deliveries, too; these don't incur the normal \u00a35 charge. www.marks-and-spencer.co.uk Not with the front-runners in the online shopping race, but offers a range of wines for home delivery, with the trademark returns policy. Gorgeous pictures of food abound on the site, though, and bosses recently announced their intention to expand to include some of their luxury food ranges. www.icelandfreeshop. com A pioneer of home shopping, and the only one to claim a nationwide service, covering 97% of the population. Delivery is free, but you must spend a minimum of \u00a340 and live within 10 miles of a store (three miles within the M25). GM-free, too. www.asda.co.uk Ventured into online shopping last year with asda@home in Croydon and Watford, but there are no details on their website. www.co-op.co.uk Big on banking, but short on food: stay-at-home shoppers are currently restricted to wines or domestic appliances. www.safeway.co.uk Still trialling EasiOrder in Basingstoke; a palm-sized organiser compiles and sends lists to the store. www.24-7.co.uk The online arm of Somerfield, not yet fully operational, promises 5,000 product lines and a large organic range, plus ordering through interactive TV. www.foodferry.co.uk Chuck away the loyalty cards, as foodferry will take your list and shop everywhere, and even unpack your groceries for you. Next-day delivery; London only, though. www.freshfood.co.uk The UK's biggest online organic store, with more than 4,500 lines. The owners promise that you can do your weekly shop here, so start with one of their boxes - fresh produce, meat or fish - and take your pick from the greens on offer. Delivery costs a fiver, and is only on Thursdays, though you can set up a regular food drop. www.organicsdirect. co.uk This site offers a box scheme which will see prime fruit and veg arriving on your doorstep from only \u00a312.95 including delivery. No meats yet, but breads, dairy and booze are covered. For an even speedier service, Londoners can try www. organicdelivery.co.uk.",

They found Laura in the spare room and they only tied her arms and legs behind her. \"She was hiding in the cupboard, but they found her pretty quickly,\" said Mr Jowett. \"They kept on asking her who she was going to vote for. She told them she didn't know any party.\" The men then raped the sisters. \"I could hear them,\" he said. The men then ransacked the house, loading a Mazda pickup truck. Mr Jowett then said one of the men found a bottle of furniture oil and started to spread it all over the furniture inside the house and over Tonia. They then tried to set light to the oil but it did not catch. \"They were questioning Laura, they held a pellet gun to her head, saying they would shoot her if she didn't speak,\" said Mr Jowett. The men then kicked Mr Jowett to see if he was still alive. He said one of the men offered to stab him to make sure that he was dead. The men spent another hour loading up their truck with loot. \"Tonia was first up. She managed to get her hands out of the braces they tied her with because they were elasticised. Then she called to me. \"At that stage I didn't answer. I wasn't sure if people were still there. \"Tonia ran through to Laura, then untied her. Tonia thought I was probably dead, but she came back and found I was alive. She undid me. \"I knew what was going on around me. \"They really tied me up tight, I had no feeling in my hands and my feet,\" Mr Jowett added. Mr Jowett, his wife and sister-in-law then stole out of the back of the cottage, climbed a fence and walked the three miles to Zimbabwe's international airport.",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair yesterday launched a withering attack on William Hague, lampooning his attempts to criticise increased government running costs as \"Hague-onomics\" which relied on distorted statistics. In some of their bitterest exchanges in the Commons, the prime minister rounded on Mr Hague after the Tory leader accused him of allowing spending on the running of government departments to spiral out of control. Ministers had spent \u00a3633m more than their original estimates in the last year, with the costs of Downing Street increasing by 23%. Mr Hague said: \"This is a government where more money is spent each year on spin doctors, political advisors, bureaucracy - nowhere more so than in 10 Downing Street ... \"On its own figures [this government] spends \u00a32bn more and spends it on pen pushers, not on police, on bureaucrats not on teachers, on spin doctors not on real doctors. Isn't that why this is a government that taxes so much more and delivers so much less?\" Brandishing a Treasury document, Mr Hague said that the Department of Trade and Industry had increased its spending by \u00a3114m over the past three years, while the Lord Chancellor's department had seen costs rise by \u00a3100m. \"Where has the Lord Chancellor spent \u00a3100m?\" Mr Hague joked. \"He can't have spent it all on wallpaper in the Lord Chancellor's department.\" The prime minister accused Mr Hague of distorting the figures, insisting that costs had fallen in real terms. \"This [is a] pathetic attempt because Hague-onomics is beginning to be found out,\" Mr Blair said. \"By the time we get through with them in the next general election, your economic policy will be in ruins along with your party.\" The prime minister reminded Mr Hague that public funds to support the Opposition had increased threefold. \"All I can say is on value for money terms, if you are getting three times the amount of Short money [official money for running the Opposition office], you should get better advice than you got then to ask these questions again,\" Mr Blair said. The prime minister said that the only increases were good news for voters. \"The numbers of nurses under this government is up,\" Mr Blair said. \"The number of doctors is up. The number of teachers are up as well. The only thing that is going down is the Tory party.\" The exchanges between Mr Blair and Mr Hague were good parlimentary knockabout two weeks ahead of next month's local government elections. But both leaders were disingenuous in their interpretation of the Treasury's figures on the government's running costs. Mr Hague was right to point out that spending by some departments has increased. Overall spending, however, has only increased in real terms by 1.4% - hardly the dramatic rise criticised by the Tory leader. The prime minister misled MPs because his claim that spending has fallen in real terms is based on last year's figures. Government running costs last year amounted to \u00a314bn, which is less than the \u00a314.3bn in real terms spent by the Tories in their last year in office. However, government spending for this year is expected to rise to \u00a314.5bn, which is 1.4% more than the Tories spent in their last year.",

      "bodyText": "The rail industry yesterday became embroiled in a bitter internal fight over who should bear the responsibility for the Paddington rail crash in which 31 people died and 227 were injured. The two train companies involved, Thames Trains and Great Western, have both lodged claims against Raitrack, while Railtrack has issued a counter claim against Thames Trains. The bitter conflict is a legacy of privatisation when British Rail was split off into more than 100 companies. Whenever a major incident took place, BR immediately accepted responsibility, and legal experts have constantly warned of problems since the break-up. Railtrack said the action was \"an insurance claim\" to recover costs of clearing the wreckage and added: \"This is part of the legal process.\" It denied that it was an attempt to influence the outcome of Lord Cullen's inquiry into the accident, which opens next month. Great Western confirmed that it had issued a liability notice against Railtrack. \"This is an automatic legal process and does not have any effect on claims lodged by passengers or those involved with the tragedy.\" Thames Trains declined to comment in advance of the inquiry. The crash is estimated to have cost more than \u00a320m, and Lord Cullen's inquiry is likely to blame many factors for the worst rail crash since the Clapham tragedy 12 years ago. Some key sections of evidence are being assembled, including a report from the health and safety executive that a section of track badly out of alignment could have affected on-train safety equipment. The equipment could have indicated to the Thames driver, Michael Holder, that he was approaching a green signal rather than a red. The report has already been challenged by Gerald Corbett, Railtrack's chief executive, who said that he had not been provided with any scientific information about the HSE's theory. Lord Cullen's inquiry will be the most important statement about the railway industry since privatisation and will cause the government to reconsider key safety aspects. One of the results could the setting up of a separate rail safety body. Group 4, the security firm, yesterday joined a group of bidders for one of the rail franchises. It is one of six contenders for the franchise run by Stagecoach-owned South West Trains. It is also bidding for Central Trains in the Midlands and the proposed Trans Pennine Express between Sheffield and Manchester. A Group 4 spokeswoman said: \"We are new to the rail business but have experience in raising private investment and the transfer of people.\"",

      "bodyText": "Hillary Clinton's team for her New York senate seat campaign has returned a $22,000 (\u00a314,000) contribution from a businesswoman who has been linked by investigators to a convicted drug-trafficker. \"The contribution was inappropriate,\" said Howard Wolfson, Mrs Clinton's campaign spokesman. The donation came from Vivian Mannerud, whose company runs charter flights between Cuba and Miami. Ms Mannerud has been linked by congressional investigators to Jorge Cabrera, who admitted last year smuggling 2,700kg (6,000lb) of cocaine into the US and was jailed for 19 years and fined $1.5m. She is said to have promised Cabrera an invitation to a fundraising dinner in honour of the vice-president, Al Gore, five years ago in return for a donation of $20,000 to the Democratic party. It is alleged that the cheque he wrote was drawn on an account which held his profits from drug-smuggling. The party returned the contribution, but not before Cabrera had been invited to a White House Christmas party, where he was photographed with Mrs Clinton and Mr Gore. Three weeks later Cabrera was arrested at a Florida warehouse and accused of drug-smuggling. A picture of him with the Cuban leader, Fidel Castro, was found in his briefcase, and he tried to make a deal for leniency in return for implicating the Cuban government in drug-dealing. Ms Mannerud, who has never been charged with any offence, said that she believed that Cabrera was a fisherman and did not know that he had served more than three years in jail for drug-related crimes. She also said that she did not remember mentioning that a contribution could earn him an invitation to the Gore dinner in Miami. Ms Mannerud was in the news three months ago when she volunteered ago to fly Elian Gonzalez - the Cuban boy at the centre of a bitter custody battle - back to Havana on a private jet. Mrs Clinton's standing in the polls has improved recently because of the way the New York mayor, Rudolph Giuliani - her rival in the senate race - is regarded as having mishandled the affair of the fatal police shooting of an unarmed black man outside a bar. The Rev Al Sharpton, a black civil rights activist, is running a series of demonstrations against the New York police department, with one protest each day this week. Yesterday's demonstrations was held on Wall Street. On Tuesday night Mr Sharpton and 26 other protesters were arrested after attempting to burst into a Broadway theatre where a performance of The Phantom of the Opera was being given. On Monday 15 people were arrested at the first protest. Mr Sharpton said that Easter week had been chosen for the protests because \"a lot of tourists come to New York at this time and they need to go home knowing that there is outrage in this city\".",

The war veterans got their recognition and money and Mr Mugabe got the private army that is spearheading Zanu-PF's campaign to cling to power.</p> <p>Mr Hunzvi has played one card especially hard - race. He is particularly combative about Zimbabwe's white minority. \"The white farmers have two options: to hand over the land and leave or to stay and see what land we leave them,\" he said. \"The whites are foreigners, they are British! They should go back to Britain. We don't need them here. They can all go.\"</p> <p>Mr Hunzvi, who took the nickname \"Hitler\" during the independence struggle, also shows no remorse.</p> <p>\"All revolutions require violence,\" he said recently. \"I am like Napoleon Bonaparte, Che Guevara or like Adolf Hitler himself. They are figures no one could stop and who led a revolution. Now no one can stop the revolution we have started.\"</p> <p>Yesterday Mr Hunzvi was convicted of contempt of court for not ordering the veterans to vacate the farms they have illegally occupied but he remains defiant. \"I cannot tell my followers to go against the orders of President Mugabe,\" he said. \"The president says we must stay and he is going to redistribute the land.</p> <p>\"I'm very happy. We will be intensifying our efforts to redistribute the land to the Zimbabwean people. Our people are not squatters on commercial farms, they are Zimbabweans on Zimbabwean land. That is the land that we went to war for and we are going to stay on that land.\"</p> <p>When asked about the high court order that the war veterans should leave the farms, he retorted angrily: \"Why should we observe the law? What laws did you observe when you came and stole the land from the African people? Did you think of law when you grabbed our land?\"</p> <p>Mr Hunzvi also derided the suggestion that Zimbabwe might become isolated from the international community over the wave of violence, the farm invasions and the breakdown of rule of law.</p> <p>\"We don't care if this isolates us from the west. Did the westerners supply us during our war of liberation? No. They called us terrorists. They isolated us then. So it is not new.</p> <p>\"We are fighting an economic war and it is much more bitter than the political war. You provoked some sanctions and that makes us suffer. We must protect ourselves. It is a bitter war.\"</p> <p>But who controls who is still not established. The war veterans have it in their power to destroy Mr Mugabe, but without his protection they might well be crushed by the army.</p> <p>One veteran Zanu-PF official believes Mr Mugabe has a very uneasy relationship with Mr Hunzvi. \"He is like a man who keeps hunting dogs. They may live in the garden but one day they will be let loose to hunt and all the time he is a little bit afraid of the dogs,\" he said.</p> <p>The other unanswered question is what reward Mr Hunzvi will demand after the elections. Already there are some clues: Zanu-PF stalwarts are being pushed aside as parliamentary candidates in favour of war veterans.</p>",

He is particularly combative about Zimbabwe's white minority. \"The white farmers have two options: to hand over the land and leave or to stay and see what land we leave them,\" he said. \"The whites are foreigners, they are British! They should go back to Britain. We don't need them here. They can all go.\" Mr Hunzvi, who took the nickname \"Hitler\" during the independence struggle, also shows no remorse. \"All revolutions require violence,\" he said recently. \"I am like Napoleon Bonaparte, Che Guevara or like Adolf Hitler himself. They are figures no one could stop and who led a revolution. Now no one can stop the revolution we have started.\" Yesterday Mr Hunzvi was convicted of contempt of court for not ordering the veterans to vacate the farms they have illegally occupied but he remains defiant. \"I cannot tell my followers to go against the orders of President Mugabe,\" he said. \"The president says we must stay and he is going to redistribute the land. \"I'm very happy. We will be intensifying our efforts to redistribute the land to the Zimbabwean people. Our people are not squatters on commercial farms, they are Zimbabweans on Zimbabwean land. That is the land that we went to war for and we are going to stay on that land.\" When asked about the high court order that the war veterans should leave the farms, he retorted angrily: \"Why should we observe the law? What laws did you observe when you came and stole the land from the African people? Did you think of law when you grabbed our land?\" Mr Hunzvi also derided the suggestion that Zimbabwe might become isolated from the international community over the wave of violence, the farm invasions and the breakdown of rule of law. \"We don't care if this isolates us from the west. Did the westerners supply us during our war of liberation? No. They called us terrorists. They isolated us then. So it is not new. \"We are fighting an economic war and it is much more bitter than the political war. You provoked some sanctions and that makes us suffer. We must protect ourselves. It is a bitter war.\" But who controls who is still not established. The war veterans have it in their power to destroy Mr Mugabe, but without his protection they might well be crushed by the army. One veteran Zanu-PF official believes Mr Mugabe has a very uneasy relationship with Mr Hunzvi. \"He is like a man who keeps hunting dogs. They may live in the garden but one day they will be let loose to hunt and all the time he is a little bit afraid of the dogs,\" he said. The other unanswered question is what reward Mr Hunzvi will demand after the elections. Already there are some clues: Zanu-PF stalwarts are being pushed aside as parliamentary candidates in favour of war veterans.",

The prime minister stressed that a meeting with Commonwealth ministers was scheduled for May 2 at which action could be discussed. He said the government was in touch with African leaders, but added: \"It is important that the action we take helps people in Zimbabwe and does not make the situation worse for them.\" The main thrust of government policy is to ensure Mr Mugabe honours his commitment to hold a general election next month. Although the Foreign Office minister, Peter Hain, has used harsh language in condemning Mr Mugabe, the government has avoided calls for sanctions and suspension from the Commonwealth. A boost for this approach was came yesterday when Harare set a date, April 27, for a meeting in London between a delegation of its ministers and the British government to discuss land reform. British ministers have been trying for the last week to increase international pressure on Mr Mugabe, but about the only supporter so far has been Nigeria. Its envoy briefed the foreign secretary Robin Cook yesterday on his talks with the Zimbabwean president.

She will be overseeing the exhumation of her 12-year-old son, James. Grave-diggers, screened from view, will lift him and place his coffin in the undertaker's hearse. He will return to his bedroom in the beautiful bungalow on Neds Point Road before beginning the long trip by road and air home to Ottershaw, Surrey.</p> <p>He has never been to the family's new house in England, but will stay until Saturday morning, when, after a short, intimate service, he will be re-interred in a tiny, tranquil graveyard.</p> <p>Buncrana has never seen anything quite like this before, and his parents' unorthodox approach to their son's burial is the chatter of the town. Opinion is divided, though sympathy is overwhelming for the English family who came in search of a dream.</p> <p>James Barker was one of 29 people murdered in the Omagh bombing of August 15 1998, the single worst atrocity of the Troubles. Some include the heavily pregnant Avril Monaghan's unborn twins in the death toll, and say that there were 31 victims.</p> <p>The Real IRA, dissident republicans opposed to the Good Friday agreement, assassinated Catholics as well as Protestants in the County Tyrone town. They even managed to claim the life of a Mormon.</p> <p>James had regarded the 11 months exploring the shores of Lough Swilly as the best of his life. He was mad about Chelsea football club, but he also wore the Irish Republic's green shirt with pride. His big sister, Estella, even now sneaks into his bedroom at night so she can sleep with it. Her mother finds it in her bed each morning, and takes it back to James's room. Nothing is ever said.</p> <p>As Donna-Maria, 43, and her children, Erin-Esther, 21, Estella, 15, and five-year-old Oliver-Tristan accompany James today, she will reflect on the tragedy of a three-year-old vision. After school finishes in June, she vows never to set foot again in Ireland. They are selling their unfinished house.</p> <p>She brought her three youngest children to rural Ireland in September 1997 to escape the home counties rat-race. Their new life was, for a time, the idyll she imagined.</p> <p>Her husband Victor, 43, a solicitor based in Chertsey, Surrey, is a workaholic who rarely takes a break. They compromised on a holiday home across the Irish border from Derry, where she was brought up.</p> <p>\"Then I had the bright brainwave,\" says Donna-Maria. \"Rather than use it as a holiday home, I suggested I should move over with the children. It was just so much a better quality of life and I thought it would be fantastic for them to grow up in the tranquillity of the place. We agreed, and Victor would come over every three weeks or so.</p> <p>\"Two weeks before James died I was having coffee with my mother. I remember saying to her: 'Nothing can spoil this. This is heaven.' \"</p> <p>Erin-Esther, who works with British Airways, stayed in England with Victor, while the others settled into their new lives. Estella loved her boarding school in Belfast, and James, a keen athlete, flourished at Foyle and Londonderry Preparatory school.</p> <p>\"It really was fabulous,\" says Donna-Maria. \"James loved it. He had the type of freedom he could never have had in Surrey.\"</p> <p>The day before he died, James spent an afternoon fishing with Victor in a boat on the lough. James sat on his dad's knee, telling him how much he loved it in Ireland. But he said he was sad he was unable to see more of him.</p> <p>The Barkers had bought the house from a family who hosted Spanish pupils arriving in Buncrana each year on an exchange visit. The organisers called to check if the new owner would again take a student.</p> <p>Estella was studying Spanish, and Donna-Maria figured it a good idea. They were joined by Uki Baselga, whose brother, Fernando, 12, stayed with a family nearby. He became inseparable from James.</p> <p>They were shopping in Omagh after an organised bus visit to the Ulster-American Folk Museum just outside the town when the massive car bomb exploded. Fernando was killed outright, along with Spanish teacher Rocio Ramos, 23, and Sean McLoughlin, 12, and eight-year-old Oran Doherty, both from Buncrana.</p> <p>James was blown on to a roof. He lived for more than three hours as doctors vainly pumped 18 pints of blood into him.</p> <p>Donna-Maria thought the museum was in Belfast. Her mother was reassuring her on the phone at 6.47pm, the time James died, and it was only when her mum appeared at St John's restaurant in nearby Fahan at 10.30pm that she realised something was seriously awry.</p> <p>There then followed a nightmare as they tried to secure information. They decided to head for Omagh, and were eventually guided to the town's leisure centre at 3.30am. It was to be four more hours before they learned the worst. They were the last of the bereaved to be told.</p> <p>Donna-Maria says: \"The other families had each other. We were on our own. We were total strangers.</p> <p>\"James was covered in a green blanket with a white handkerchief-sized cloth over his head. A man all in green with three-quarter wellies on him pulled it back.</p> <p>\"James had his head towards me, to the right. He had a huge bandage on his head. His face was blood-stained and very badly bruised.</p> <p>\"His eyes were wide-open and looking towards me. He had the most beautiful emerald eyes, dancing, smiling eyes, and I had never realised the exact shade of them until then.</p> <p>\"I went towards him to put my arms around him, and I remember the man in the green outfit started forward. I looked up and said: 'I am not going to hurt my boy. I just want to hold him.' I remember kissing his lips. He was so cold. He was so cold.\"</p> <p>They had never been to Omagh before, and got lost on the way home. Hanging on the clothes line in the sunlight was James's Chelsea top.</p> <p>She found a poem he had just written to Victor after reading an old school report of his father, who had gone to Eton. His dad had come second in German, the only time he was ever anything other than first.</p> <p>Entitled For the Future, it was written in pencil on a sheet of A4 paper, and concluded with his flourishing signature, it was one of several scrunched-up drafts. She laid it beside him in his coffin.</p> <p>He spoke in the note of working as hard as his father to become a lawyer himself, and said that he wanted to give Victor a rest. After he had studied, his father would teach him until he was ready, and then, he said, he would take over \"the joint\".</p> <p>Donna-Maria pulls out photographs of her son in his coffin, his eyes ever so slightly open, his chin crudely stitched, and his face badly marked. His hair is terribly singed.</p> <p>It contrasts painfully with local artist Ken Canning's portrait of him above the fireplace, fair-haired and freckled face with his head tilted at his trademark angle.</p> <p>\"He was a beautiful, beautiful boy,\" says Donna-Maria. \"He had real special qualities, so helpful, well-mannered, and always smiling. A woman who was a camp leader on a trip he was on last year wrote to me saying how he had stood out so much among 100 boys. One lady told me how he played with her little daughter on the beach to let her relax and read her book, and then went all the way back for her when she realised she had forgotten her glasses.</p> <p>\"An old farmer came to say how James would wait for him as he went for a walk each day and have a long adult conversation with him. He said that he came to hope James would be there, and he always was.\"</p> <p>Donna-Maria is in tears constantly, but she says she has never seen her husband cry. He admits he had tried to lose himself in work. He is prominent in trying to bring the Omagh bombers to book. The RUC and Garda say they know who was responsible, but believe it unlikely they will amass the evidence to secure convictions.</p> <p>Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, recently wrote to Victor to say he would refuse to assist investigations because of the RUC's involvement. He cited historical and contemporary reasons.</p> <p>Bertie Ahern, taoiseach, has agreed to a broadcast appeal for more information just before the second anniversary. Tony Blair, meanwhile, is still sitting on the fence, enraging Victor.</p> <p>\"We were an ordinary hard-working family, trying to do the best for our children,\" he says. \"Our grief is the same as all the families.</p> <p>\"Where you come from and what you do is nothing to do with suffering. It is indiscriminate. It is indescribable.\"</p> <p>While memories of the atrocity may be fading elsewhere, they run deep in Omagh. It could hardly be any other way, says Michael Gallagher, who lost his son Aidan, 21, with the catalogue of bomb hoax calls which are still driving shoppers from the town.</p> <p>The first false warning came exactly a week after the massacre. There have been more than 100 since, some using the Real IRA's recognised codeword. There are, says Gallagher, no words to describe the mindset of those carrying them out.</p> <p>The Barkers had planned to stay to see the Omagh bombers caught. But they decided to leave two months ago, after the murders in Tandragee, Co Armagh, of David McIlwaine, 18, and Andrew Robb, 19.</p> <p>It was inconceivable to leave James behind in a graveyard where Irish tricolours will fly over republican graves this weekend to mark the 1916 Easter Rising. Donna-Maria says she wants him to be close.</p> <p>\"They are lovely people in Ireland,\" she says. \"I really hope there is lasting peace. But I am just not happy here any more. I feel so guilty for making the decision to move here. People say time is a great healer, but it is nonsense. The pain is so intense. We have paid a high, high price for our dream.\"</p>",

The organisers called to check if the new owner would again take a student. Estella was studying Spanish, and Donna-Maria figured it a good idea. They were joined by Uki Baselga, whose brother, Fernando, 12, stayed with a family nearby. He became inseparable from James. They were shopping in Omagh after an organised bus visit to the Ulster-American Folk Museum just outside the town when the massive car bomb exploded. Fernando was killed outright, along with Spanish teacher Rocio Ramos, 23, and Sean McLoughlin, 12, and eight-year-old Oran Doherty, both from Buncrana. James was blown on to a roof. He lived for more than three hours as doctors vainly pumped 18 pints of blood into him. Donna-Maria thought the museum was in Belfast. Her mother was reassuring her on the phone at 6.47pm, the time James died, and it was only when her mum appeared at St John's restaurant in nearby Fahan at 10.30pm that she realised something was seriously awry. There then followed a nightmare as they tried to secure information. They decided to head for Omagh, and were eventually guided to the town's leisure centre at 3.30am. It was to be four more hours before they learned the worst. They were the last of the bereaved to be told. Donna-Maria says: \"The other families had each other. We were on our own. We were total strangers. \"James was covered in a green blanket with a white handkerchief-sized cloth over his head. A man all in green with three-quarter wellies on him pulled it back. \"James had his head towards me, to the right. He had a huge bandage on his head. His face was blood-stained and very badly bruised. \"His eyes were wide-open and looking towards me. He had the most beautiful emerald eyes, dancing, smiling eyes, and I had never realised the exact shade of them until then. \"I went towards him to put my arms around him, and I remember the man in the green outfit started forward. I looked up and said: 'I am not going to hurt my boy. I just want to hold him.' I remember kissing his lips. He was so cold. He was so cold.\" They had never been to Omagh before, and got lost on the way home. Hanging on the clothes line in the sunlight was James's Chelsea top. She found a poem he had just written to Victor after reading an old school report of his father, who had gone to Eton. His dad had come second in German, the only time he was ever anything other than first. Entitled For the Future, it was written in pencil on a sheet of A4 paper, and concluded with his flourishing signature, it was one of several scrunched-up drafts. She laid it beside him in his coffin. He spoke in the note of working as hard as his father to become a lawyer himself, and said that he wanted to give Victor a rest. After he had studied, his father would teach him until he was ready, and then, he said, he would take over \"the joint\". Donna-Maria pulls out photographs of her son in his coffin, his eyes ever so slightly open, his chin crudely stitched, and his face badly marked. His hair is terribly singed. It contrasts painfully with local artist Ken Canning's portrait of him above the fireplace, fair-haired and freckled face with his head tilted at his trademark angle. \"He was a beautiful, beautiful boy,\" says Donna-Maria. \"He had real special qualities, so helpful, well-mannered, and always smiling. A woman who was a camp leader on a trip he was on last year wrote to me saying how he had stood out so much among 100 boys. One lady told me how he played with her little daughter on the beach to let her relax and read her book, and then went all the way back for her when she realised she had forgotten her glasses. \"An old farmer came to say how James would wait for him as he went for a walk each day and have a long adult conversation with him. He said that he came to hope James would be there, and he always was.\" Donna-Maria is in tears constantly, but she says she has never seen her husband cry. He admits he had tried to lose himself in work. He is prominent in trying to bring the Omagh bombers to book. The RUC and Garda say they know who was responsible, but believe it unlikely they will amass the evidence to secure convictions. Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, recently wrote to Victor to say he would refuse to assist investigations because of the RUC's involvement. He cited historical and contemporary reasons. Bertie Ahern, taoiseach, has agreed to a broadcast appeal for more information just before the second anniversary. Tony Blair, meanwhile, is still sitting on the fence, enraging Victor. \"We were an ordinary hard-working family, trying to do the best for our children,\" he says. \"Our grief is the same as all the families. \"Where you come from and what you do is nothing to do with suffering. It is indiscriminate. It is indescribable.\" While memories of the atrocity may be fading elsewhere, they run deep in Omagh. It could hardly be any other way, says Michael Gallagher, who lost his son Aidan, 21, with the catalogue of bomb hoax calls which are still driving shoppers from the town. The first false warning came exactly a week after the massacre. There have been more than 100 since, some using the Real IRA's recognised codeword. There are, says Gallagher, no words to describe the mindset of those carrying them out. The Barkers had planned to stay to see the Omagh bombers caught. But they decided to leave two months ago, after the murders in Tandragee, Co Armagh, of David McIlwaine, 18, and Andrew Robb, 19. It was inconceivable to leave James behind in a graveyard where Irish tricolours will fly over republican graves this weekend to mark the 1916 Easter Rising. Donna-Maria says she wants him to be close. \"They are lovely people in Ireland,\" she says. \"I really hope there is lasting peace. But I am just not happy here any more. I feel so guilty for making the decision to move here. People say time is a great healer, but it is nonsense. The pain is so intense. We have paid a high, high price for our dream.\"",

      "bodyText": "George W Bush is abandoning plans to make a series of image-boosting overseas trips later this year, including one to Britain, because his advisers fear that his tendency to make foreign-policy gaffes may turn them into a public relations embarrassment for his US presidential campaign. Mr Bush was to have made up to three foreign trips in May and June to help burnish his image as a statesman and to get to know the world leaders with whom he will have to work if he wins the White House, including Tony Blair. But the trips to Europe and Asia have now been dropped from his schedule, and he is likely to make only one overseas journey between now and the November 7 election, to Latin America. Officially, his campaign team says the European trip has not yet been formally abandoned, but his spokesman, Ari Fleischer, confirmed yesterday that it was now \"most unlikely\", because of scheduling difficulties. Diplomatic sources on both sides of the Atlantic confirm that they no longer expect to see Mr Bush in Europe before the election. At the heart of the decision to scale back Mr Bush's planned international exposure is thought to be the belief, especially among some of his Texas-based advisers, that the trip could turn into an embarrassing media ordeal which could diminish Mr Bush's credibility in the contest with his Democratic opponent, Vice-President Al Gore. In the past, US presidential hopefuls have made something of a point of being photographed on the international stage at this point in the political calendar, in the belief that such contacts go down well with the voters back home as well as being a helpful investment for future understanding and cooperation. Mr Bush's predecessor as the Republican challenger, Bob Dole, made such a trip at the end of 1994, during which he met the then British prime minister, John Major, in Downing Street, and other leaders. But, reflecting the changed priorities of modern campaigning, Mr Bush's advisers have decided to play safe and remain in control of their man's candidacy back home rather than risk things spinning out of control in the relatively unfamiliar environment of an overseas visit. Instead of visiting Europe and Asia, Mr Bush is now expected to make only the visit to Latin America - probably to Mexico and other central American states - which he will use to try to strengthen his appeal among US Latino voters, a constituency which he has cultivated as governor of Texas. Mr Bush will meet the Mexican president, Ernesto Zedillo, next week when the two men are scheduled to attend a border bridge opening ceremony in Laredo, Texas. The advisers believe that Mr Bush would have been likely to face demonstrations in some European capitals on such issues as capital punishment, gun control and the environment, though such events would not necessarily be seen as a political disadvantage to him. Their main anxiety was thought to be the risk that Mr Bush might be ambushed by the travelling US media, or even by their European counterparts, into committing another in the series of gaffes which plagued his early efforts to present himself as a qualified leader of the free world. Mr Bush has still not fully lived down his failure to name a number of foreign leaders when a Boston television journalist surprised him last year with an on-camera \"pop quiz\" about the leaders of India, Pakistan, Taiwan and Chechnya. Though Mr Bush has subsequently made generally well-received keynote speeches on defence and foreign affairs, he remains dogged by the view that, on these issues at least, he is lost without his cue cards. Plans for Mr Bush to visit Europe had been under active discussion between his advisers and diplomats in several European capitals for several months. The trip was thought likely to take place once Mr Bush had wrapped up his party's presidential nomination - which he did in March - and before the Republican convention in Philadelphia in late July. Mr Bush himself confirmed to the Guardian in November that this was his intention. Though no itinerary had been finalised, London was always near the top of the list of likely stops, and the prime minister issued a formal invitation to Mr Bush late last year. Other stops discussed in the Bush camp included Belgium, where Mr Bush was to have met Nato and European Union officials; Germany, because of its importance; Spain, where the governor's proficiency in Spanish could be exploited; Ireland, always a tempting stage for an American politician running for office; and Poland, where Mr Bush hoped to address post-cold-war east-west issues and make a pitch to the largely Catholic Polish-American vote. In spite of his unusual personal and political closeness to President Clinton, Mr Blair has made several private moves in recent months to open channels of communication with Mr Bush.

      "bodyText": "A 15-year-old boy has been charged with two counts of computer mischief for crippling the CNN website and 1,200 related sites in a cyber attack, police said yesterday. His computer name was \"Mafiaboy\", but he cannot be identified under Canadian law. Cyber attacks against CNN, Yahoo!, eBay, Amazon, ETrade and other major web sites in February inconvenienced millions of users and raised questions about internet security. The apparently coordinated attacks overloaded the sites with a barrage of messages generated by hackers. Inspector Yves Roussel of the Royal Canadian Mounted police said the boy had boasted in internet chat rooms about what he had done. The boy was released on bail conditions that included not connecting to the internet. The investigation conducted jointly by the RCMP, the FBI and US justice department was continuing, Mr Roussel said. \"Wherever they are, hackers will be investigated and arrested.\" But Rick Broadhead, an internet consultant, said cyber attacks would continue. \"We shouldn't feel any more safe because of this arrest,\" he said. \"It is a new form of terrorism called cyber terrorism. I really believe it won't go away.\" A spokesman for the FBI said the damage caused by international hacking could run to hundreds of millions of dollars. The attacks involved placing tools on middleman computers and remotely ordering them to overwhelm the victim site with fake traffic. Three computers have been identified as middlemen in the February attacks: a computer at the University of California, Santa Barbara; a router at Stanford University; and a home business computer in the area of Portland, Oregon. Investigators say that dozens, even hundreds, of middlemen computers were used in the attacks.

Back in 1978, when Dobbo was going for the Labour nomination in the Holborn and St Pancras South constituency, the most popular candidate for the safe seat was journalist Chris Mullin (now MP for Sunderland South).

It has also been seen as a possible ploy to build support in Michigan.</p> <p>Mr Bush has made a habit of mentioning possible vice-presidential candidates as he tries to reunite his party after a bitter primary season. As well as Mr McCain, he has mentioned his former rival Elizabeth Dole, the Pennsylvania governor Tom Ridge, and the New Jersey governor Christine Todd Whitman as possibilities.</p> <p>On the other hand, Mr Bush is under pressure to mend some fences with Mr McCain, who won wide support from the independents and Democratic swing voters the candidate needs to attract in November.</p> <p>The two men have arranged their first meeting since the primary season on May 9 in Pittsburgh.</p> <p>The vice-presidential nomination will be one of the many items on the agenda, as will the role Mr McCain will play in the Republican national convention in Philadelphia in late July and early August and Mr Bush's willingness to adopt some of Mr McCain's ideas for campaign finance reform as part of the party platform.</p> <p>Mr Bush is expected to announce soon that he has asked the former US defence secretary Dick Cheney to head a committee to examine a range of possible Republican vice-presidential nominees.</p>",

Mr McCain has consistently ruled out the possibility of being the number two on anyone's ticket. \"I know he's said he's not interested, but until I talk to him and find out how interested he is, I'll give him consideration,\" Mr Bush said at a news conference at Dearborn, outside Detroit. \"I just need to look him in the eye and visit with him on that.\" \"Talk like this is always flattering, whether it's from Governor Bush or [the Minnesota governor] Jesse Ventura,\" a spokesman for Mr McCain said. \"However, Senator McCain has made it more than clear that he is not interested in being vice-president.\" Bush-watchers suspect that the unprompted mention of Mr McCain may not have been entirely spontaneous, not least because Michigan's Republican governor, John Engler, a strong Bush backer, echoed his comments yesterday in a separate television interview. It has also been seen as a possible ploy to build support in Michigan. Mr Bush has made a habit of mentioning possible vice-presidential candidates as he tries to reunite his party after a bitter primary season. As well as Mr McCain, he has mentioned his former rival Elizabeth Dole, the Pennsylvania governor Tom Ridge, and the New Jersey governor Christine Todd Whitman as possibilities. On the other hand, Mr Bush is under pressure to mend some fences with Mr McCain, who won wide support from the independents and Democratic swing voters the candidate needs to attract in November. The two men have arranged their first meeting since the primary season on May 9 in Pittsburgh. The vice-presidential nomination will be one of the many items on the agenda, as will the role Mr McCain will play in the Republican national convention in Philadelphia in late July and early August and Mr Bush's willingness to adopt some of Mr McCain's ideas for campaign finance reform as part of the party platform. Mr Bush is expected to announce soon that he has asked the former US defence secretary Dick Cheney to head a committee to examine a range of possible Republican vice-presidential nominees.",

      "bodyText": "The United States anti-drugs czar, Barry McCaffrey, is waging a different kind of war to those which have dominated his past and present careers: one against a journalist he accuses of writing an article containing \"alarming and defamatory allegations\" which reduced his wife to tears. The retired general said on Tuesday that the veteran investigative journalist Seymour Hersh, who won a Pulitzer prize for his exposure of the My Lai massacre during the Vietnam war, is spreading false stories about his military career while researching an article intended for publication in the New Yorker magazine. General McCaffrey has written to the magazine's editor, David Remnick, and other news organisations alleging that Mr Hersh has been conducting defamatory interviews filled with false allegations, according to reports published in the Washington Post and issued by US news agencies yesterday. Among the allegations, the Associated Press reported, are claims that troops led by Gen McCaffrey killed Iraqi prisoners of war and committed other crimes which were covered up by the US army during the Gulf war; that he committed several unspecified felonies during his Vietnam era service; and that he \"acted inappropriately\" in developing the Clinton administration's proposed $1.6bn (\u00a31bn) anti-drugs aid plan for Colombia. Part of Mr Hersh's investigation of Mr McCaffrey concerns allegations that the 24th Infantry Division was, while under the general's command, involved in war crimes against Iraqi prisoners of war at Tallil air force base in 1991. Mr McCaffrey wrote a memo last Friday in which he defended himself against the allegations. \"I've gotten calls from dozens of friends over the last three months reporting a series of accusations by Mr Hersh, ranging from bike theft at age 11 to atrocities in the Gulf war,\" Gen McCaffrey told the agency. \"They are defamatory and sort of frightening to my friends and family.\" Mr Hersh said he would not comment on an article which has not yet been published. He has written to Mr McCaffrey's office, however, rejecting the general's suggestion that the interviews for the article were designed to impugn him. \"Your allegations are wrong,\" Mr Hersh said in his letter. \"I am simply going about my business, as I have for the past 35 or so years, asking questions, listening to answers and trying to verify and assess what I've been told.\" The New Yorker's head of editorial came down squarely behind the veteran journalist. \"I have complete confidence in Sy Hersh,\" Mr Remnick told the Washington Post. \"Remember, we haven't published a thing yet.\" Mr Hersh, 63, has acquired an awesome reputation as a intensely thorough investigative reporter, one that remains intact. Last year he interviewed more than 100 people for another New Yorker article, which questioned whether the US had bombed the right target in 1998 when it attacked an alleged chemicals factory in Sudan following the embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. But his reputation took a knock three years ago when his book on the Kennedy family, The Dark Side of Camelot, had to be changed at the last minute after it became clear that Mr Hersh had been conned by a source who had sold him phoney papers supposedly documenting a pay-off to the film star Marilyn Monroe.",

Coalition leaders were struggling to agree on a successor who could unify their seven parties and resist the opposition's clamour for an immediate general election. President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi will meet political leaders today and tomorrow to decide whether the centre-left should try to form a new government. If a candidate is not found Mr Ciampi can call an election or appoint a non-political caretaker to lead until the scheduled elections in April 2001. Mr D'Alema, Italy's first ex-communist prime minister, will remain in office until a new government is formed. He resigned in a 20-minute speech to the senate, but appealed to fractious colleagues to revive the alliance that has ruled Italy for 18 months. Mr D'Alema had offered to resign on Monday but the president asked him to first test the feelings of parliament.

As a result of the ruling, Great Ormond Street hospital for children will now receive a \u00a3200,000 bequest under the terms of the will left by the 76-year-old widow after her death in April 1997. The judge found that Lily Morris, who had severe dementia, had fallen under the \"undue influence\" of her full-time carer and cleaner Pauline Rushin and Mrs Rushin's daughter, Caroline Billinge, 27, who convinced her to hand over the \u00a3300,000 Derbyshire farm house to Mrs Rushin and make other gifts, including a Porsche and a BMW. Mrs Morris, a retired nurse who once worked at Great Ormond Street hospital, had left the bulk of her estate to the hospital in her final will, but in February 1996 she signed an agreement leaving her house to her housekeeper in return for \u00a350 and a promise she would be looked after for the rest of her life. Mr Justice Rimer set aside the agreement on the grounds that Mrs Morris did not have sufficient mental capacity to enter into such a contract, saying the mother's and daughter's evidence had been \"untruthful and unconvincing\". The judge said he had \"the gravest doubts\" as to whether the widow had acted of her own free will in signing the agreement with the housekeeper, adding: \"I regard the whole course of events leading up to it as redolent with grounds for suspicion.\" The widow, who died by strangulation when her clothing was accidentally trapped in a stair lift, embarked on a \"quite irrational\" spending spree in the months before her death, the judge said.

Three judges overturned an earlier decision which had ordered the paper to disclose its source. They said the incident was a one-off which should not be used to erode the right of reporters to protect their sources. During the original hearing at the high court in London, Mr Justice Morland was told that a draft of a barrister's written opinion, which had been discarded at his chambers, found its way to the Express journalist Rachel Baird. After making notes about the document, Ms Baird tore it up, put the pieces in an envelope and asked a colleague to dispose of them. They ended up in a Soho dustbin. When Ms Baird telephoned Sir Elton's lawyers for a comment on the information she had gained, they immediately obtained an injunction banning publication. The injunction remains in force. Mr Justice Morland had ruled that the newspaper should disclose its source because that person presented a \"very real and continuing danger to the interests of justice, threatening the confidentiality of legal professional privilege\". \"Balancing the competing interests of justice and of investigative journalism, in the exercise of my discretion in my judgment I do not consider it disproportionate to order, and do so order, the defendants to disclose the identity of the source.\" Express Newspapers, the paper's editor Rosie Boycott and journalist Rachel Baird appealed, arguing that the paper had a \"public interest\" defence under the contempt of court act. Giving his judgment yesterday, the master of the rolls, Lord Woolf, said that Mr Justice Morland was \"clearly wrong\" to conclude that the desire to identify the source overrode the need to protect that person. There was a \"prime need\" to protect the source \"in the interest of ensuring a free press in a democratic society\", he said. \u0095 The hospital which houses Moors murderer Ian Brady yesterday won a high court order directing the Mirror newspaper to reveal the source who handed over confidential records on the killer.

A survey of 31 branch secretaries showed unanimous concern that disruptive behaviour was making it harder for children to learn. Most thought behaviour had deteriorated since the government set targets to reduce permanent exclusions by a third by 2002. Three in four said schools did not get adequate support for dealing with pupils at risk of exclusion and 71% said teachers did not get enough help with handling violent, abusive, disruptive pupils, or those who bully other pupils. \"Students now believe they can be rude, abusive, violent, cast false allegations, set off fire alarms and the school will accept them back,\" said one. \"Being sworn at is something that happens so regularly in school that the teachers don't bother with it any more,\" said another. Martin Pilkington, the association's head of legal services, said local education authorities had a duty of care to staff and pupils. Under health and safety regulations, they should conduct risk assessments before allowing pupils with a history of disruptive behaviour to return to the classroom. \"If teachers are physically injured, they can commence proceedings for negligence against the LEA.\" Cases could also be brought by parents of children who have been injured by other pupils. And there might be grounds for legal action against loss of educational opportunities caused by the disruptive behaviour of classmates, he said. Jennifer Bangs, the association's president, told the conference of \"the hour upon hour of energy-draining, confidence-sapping work that goes into containing and maintaining those youngsters whose behaviour is persistently antisocial.\" The social inclusion policy was laudable, but teachers could not be expected to solve all society's ills. Children with learning difficulties and behavioural problems were often better served in special schools where places had been cut on grounds of cost. \"Not to marginalise them, not to exclude them, but to acknowledge candidly that in a civilised society caring for the many often means making specific ... provision for the few,\" said Ms Bangs, a teacher at West Park community school in Derby. The association issued a four-point action plan calling for: \u0095 stronger emphasis on behaviour management during teacher training; \u0095 behaviour management courses for teachers this year; \u0095 early intervention strategies to nip misbehaviour in the bud among the under-fives; \u0095 support centres to help schools with behaviour problems. Peter Smith, the association's general secretary, said: \"Teachers do believe social inclusion is a good thing, but they want to make sure youngsters get the proper specialist support they are entitled to.\" Mr Blunkett is expected to tell teachers next week at the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers conference in Llandudno that the social inclusion policy is not meant to permit violence in the classroom. Education department sources said the government was funding 400 units for disruptive pupils. Everyday violence Examples of school violence reported to the conference: \u0095 At an unnamed Nottingham secondary school, pupils removed part of the roof and poured hot pitch into the classroom below during a lesson. Only one of the culprits was punished by a short period of exclusion. \u0095 At another Nottingham secondary school, teachers were advised to get as many of their pupils as possible into the classroom at the start of the lesson and then to lock the door. \u0095 A newly qualified woman teacher had to hide in a cupboard to escape from a pupil who had assaulted her and then chased her round the school.",

      "bodyText": "An army doctor and former SAS trooper who machine-gunned his fiancee to death in a pub car park started a life jail sentence yesterday after a judge dismissed his Gulf war syndrome defence as spurious. Thomas Shanks, a consultant anaesthetist and holder of the Military Medal, reverted fatally into a calculating killer, a jury at Sheffield crown court decided, after nurse Vicky Fletcher jilted him for another man. But his conviction for murder - instead of manslaughter which he had admitted on grounds of personality changes caused by Gulf war service as a captain in the Royal Army Medical Corps - was by a 10-2 majority verdict and came after a previous trial ended in deadlock. Shanks, 49, showed little emotion at the verdict and sentence. The family of Ms Fletcher, who was 26 years younger than Shanks and previously brought assault charges against him, welcomed the fact that \"justice has at last been done.\" The shaven-headed doctor told police that he could not bear the thought of Ms Fletcher with another man, the court heard. On the night of May 7, 1998, knowing she was drinking with her new partner at a pub near the hospital in Pontefract, West Yorkshire, at which he and Ms Fletcher worked, he cleaned and loaded the AK47 and put it into the boot of his car with a baseball bat, axe and knife. After confronting the nurse at one pub and scuffling with David Griffin, the 47-year-old who had taken his place, he tailed them to the Lamplighters pub in Castleford. He told the court that what followed was unreal and \"like being in a video\", but witnesses described his behaviour as cool and controlled. Shanks went briefly on the run but gave himself up near Glasgow after phoning his former wife, Julie, who had been placed under police guard with their nine-year-old daughter Jodie. Shanks was one of nine children of a labourer who died of an epileptic fit. After his mother took to drink, Shanks ran away, and joined the army at 17. The SAS changed everything - evidence from an anonymous colonel described him as exceptionally brave and honest - and on discharge he took O and A levels and qualified as a doctor at Birmingham University. But the court heard there had always been a darker side to him, including an incident when he head-butted a policeman after being arrested for drunken driving. Problems grew after he was stabbed by skinheads in Birmingham during medical training, and became pronounced on his return from call-up as a RAMC doctor in the Gulf, the court heard. Ray Bristow, a warrant officer who served with Shanks in the Gulf, said he had visited the doctor in prison and was convinced Gulf war syndrome had affected him.",

Now the big news from America is that the modern male has moved on from designer suits to steroids, from facial masks to the pursuit of serious muscle. The narcissistic peacock has been replaced by a new generation of male neurotics suffering from what is being called The Adonis Complex.</p> <p>That is the name of the latest \"sensational\" book from the States, based on research by three psychologists, which argues that modern men have an unhealthy obsession with their body image. Where once men got a sense of self-worth and esteem through the workplace, now they're working out in gyms and guzzling down steroids in hot and dangerous pursuit of the perfect body. According to one of the book's authors, Dr Harrison Pope: \"Millions of men are suffering shame, self-doubt and embarrassment because of this damaging emphasis on body image.\"</p> <p>The question is: has this book really managed to capture a neglected aspect of the crisis of masculinity or is it symptomatic of a growing victim culture, in which to make money with a book you simply manufacture a malady and give it a catchy name like The Adonis Complex? Don't be fooled into thinking that this is just some silly American preoccupation at which we can poke fun. At a time when suicide rates, depression levels and use of steroids are on the increase for young British males, many commentators here are saying the kind of things that are found in The Adonis Complex.</p> <p>A central claim of the book is that today it is men, even more than women, who suffer from anxiety about the state of their bodies. The authors cite surveys that reveal that 38% of American men want bigger pecs, while only 34% of women want bigger breasts. And when it comes to acne anxiety, young male teenagers are more worried than females.</p> <p>It seems we men are also victimised by what Naomi Wolf once called The Beauty Myth. Supposedly, the media and movies are awash with images of men with superb muscular bodies. All those stars with their bulging biceps and supermodel babes - with such images of perfection, is it any wonder young men feel inadequate?</p> <p>But do they? Of course it was always a mistake to assume that anxiety about \"body appearance\" was something exclusive to women. Ever since the invention of the teenager in the late 50s, adolescent males have been spending more of their time in front of the mirror and more of their income on products that promise to make them more attractive.</p> <p>The grooming boom that really began in the 80s has been, on balance, a good thing. What woman wants to be involved with some fat, greasy, smelly slob of a man who never makes the effort to look nice? And, yes, there are times when a man looks in the mirror and wants to weep at the gruesome blob he's become and wishes he could swap bodies with Brad Pitt.</p> <p>But that's not some serious desire that dominates a man's life, as the authors of The Adonis Complex would have us believe. Go to any gym and you will see men who work hard at getting the perfect body. But most men are more modest in their body ambitions: instead of a longing for a perfection they know is impossible to attain, they would be quite happy to settle for more hair, less fat, fewer wrinkles and some muscle. Mr Average Bloke does not want to be an Andonis; just good-looking enough to get the girl of his dreams.</p> <p>What gives The Adonis Complex its controversial edge is its claim that men are turning to muscle because it is the one area in which they can be superior to women. \"Women can now fly combat aircraft, run multinational companies and have eliminated every last male bastion,\" Pope says. \"Today there's nothing a woman can't do. What does a man have left to identify himself as masculine? Few women can bench-press 300lb, so the body remains the last refuge of masculinity.\"</p> <p>It seems that, these days, just about every aspect of male behaviour is explained as some kind of scared response to the growing equality of women. But it's interesting to note that the rise of muscle-building culture occurred in America during the 50s, a time not noted for its emancipation of women. Was Charles Atlas really scared of the social advancement of Mrs Atlas - or, as legend has it, was he tired of having sand kicked in his face by men? Anyone who has seen a bunch of guys in a gym pumping iron will know that they are flexing their pecs to impress other men. I would argue that the most body-obsessed people in the world are homosexual men. Are they, too, responding to the empowerment of women?</p> <p>Most men, here and in America, do not believe that muscularity equals masculinity. Look at the success of Arnold Schwarzenegger in the 80s. He took the serious-tough-guy-real-man stuff out of muscle building and injected a new note of playful irony. Here was the muscle man who invited you to laugh at his image - and not envy it.</p> <p>If you actually look at the images associated with masculine perfection, stars like Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt, you will see that they are in good physical shape, but none of them looks like a serious body builder. And what about little Leonardo DiCaprio? The world's sexist star has far less muscle on him than Madonna.</p> <p>I suspect that men today are more concerned about their body appearance than ever before, but not because they are suffering from a crisis of masculinity or a fear of women. On the contrary, they no longer fear being seen as effeminate or homosexual every time they try a new facial scrub or dye their hair. Conversely, women like Madonna who spend a lot of their time building their muscles are no longer dismissed as sad sacks trying to look like men.</p> <p>We no longer live in a world in which there are such rigid divisions between feminine and masculine, heterosexual and homosexual. I have no doubt that men today are more concerned about the state of their bodies than ever before and it is crucial to a man's sense of self-esteem. But then our whole culture has become far more body aware. The great mass of people have more time, leisure and income than ever before to spend on looking good.

      "body": "<p>Dressed in a slinky seethrough apron, brandishing a whisk in one hand and a wooden spoon in the other, Babette, the star of a controversial new ad campaign for double cream, has come storming in from nowhere to replace supermodel tax exile Laetitia Casta as le scandale du jour in France. Currently appearing on billboards up and down the country to promote Babette double cream, the punning caption on her pinny has sparked public outrage. It reads: \"Babette: Je la lie, je la fouette et parfois elle passe \u00e0 la casserole.\" When referring to the product, this means: \"Babette: I thicken it, I whip it and sometimes it goes into the saucepan.\" But the witty double entendre can also take on a blatantly sexual connotation: \"Babette: I tie her up, I whip her and sometimes she gets laid.\"</p> <p>The campaign has been branded \"porn chic\", currently much in vogue in French advertising. While Candia, the company that makes Babette, has expressed surprise at the furore, Nicole P\u00e9ry, the Minister for Women's Rights, has publicly condemned the campaign, declaring: \"Under the cover of humour, these advertisements totally trivialise violence against women.\"</p> <p>P\u00e9ry is not alone in her concern. Viviane Monnier, spokesperson for the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Nationale Solidarit\u00e9 Femmes, which runs a helpline for battered women, has called the new porn chic \"as dangerous and degrading to women as any other type of porn\". She is seeing whether legal action can be brought against Candia for incitement to violence and rape, and is calling for a boycott of all the company's products.</p> <p>This week, Candia have defended themselves by saying the campaign was dreamt up by an all-women team, but it comes as no surprise to find it was a male director who pulled Babette's apron strings. Christophe Corsand, a creative director at French ad agency D'Arcy, says he is \"stunned\" by the reaction. \"Babette is meant to be a modern, active woman. She comes across as smart, sassy and assertive, not submissive. I think the ad is a lot less demeaning to women than the classic washing powder ads that depict Little House On The Prairie-style housewives.\"</p> <p>Corsand's argument that Babette is a self-confident, provocative woman is hard to swallow when she doesn't even have a head (\"We had to crop the picture to fit in the long slogan on the apron!\"). But the most significant part of the debate is why this ad has managed to spark such controversy when ads of a similarly offensive nature have been plastered over French billboards for the past 10 years. Bare breasts have masqueraded as melons and tomatoes, and olive oil has been promoted with the slogan: \"She's 16, she's a virgin and she's great at cooking!\" In one interactive campaign, a pouting babe in underwear promised \"Tomorrow I'll take off my top!\" (cue bare breasts the next day) and \"Next week it's the bottom!\" (Metro-users were treated to a bum shot the following week).</p> <p>Vladimir Donn, producer of Culture Pub, a French TV show that goes in for witty deconstruction of ads, claims French campaigns are often shocking to Anglo-Saxon eyes because the French do not share the same taboos about naked bodies. \"I find the Babette ad extremely funny,\" Donn says. \"People who accuse it of inciting domestic violence are missing the S&amp;M connotations.\"</p> <p>A quick poll of French friends reveals that many find the ad \"subtle\", \"sophisticated\" and \"pretty funny\". \"It's not offensive,\" insists Pauline, a graphic designer in her 30s: \"I mean, it's not as if you've got some guy standing there saying it to her!\"</p> <p>However, British friends do take offence. Anne-Marie Harper, Parisian publishing executive and working mother of two, says she is constantly shocked at the way women are portrayed in French advertising. \"When I moved here 10 years ago, I found the whole thing really upsetting,\" she says. \"I was particularly irritated by a campaign for a clothes chain called La City which had this totally gratuitous shot of a naked girl. It was almost laughable - I mean, nowhere on the poster did you get the slightest idea of what La City's clothes were like.\"</p> <p>Stephanie Theobald, author of Biche, a new novel that does for Paris what Armistead Maupin did for San Francisco, blames Babette-style advertising on general French attitudes to sex. \"Basically, the French get away with what we call sexism because sex in France, from the Marquis de Sade right through to Bernard Henri-L\u00e9vy, has always been marketed as some sort of cerebral, philosophical activity.\" In a country in which even the sleaziest wife-swapping clubs are euphemised as \"th\u00e9tres de la sexualit\u00e9\", it is perhaps little wonder that poor old Babette has been swallowed up by a slick advertising pun.</p>",

It was during the 17th Indian Division's bitter and bloody struggle with the Japanese 33rd Division on the Tiddim Road in Burma, in the final phase of the Indian division's withdrawal through the Chin Hills.</p> <p>The Japanese occupied a crucial position on the Basha East Hill, the approach to which was a narrow ridge little more than 15 ft wide. Two attempts to take the position faltered in the face of withering fire from Japanese machine-gun nests and artillery and mortars concealed in the jungle. On May 25, Gaje, now in command of his company's D platoon, was ordered to take the position.</p> <p>Encouraging his riflemen and shouting the Gurkha's battle-cry \"Ayo Gurkhali!\" (the Gurkhas are upon you), Gaje attacked. Although badly wounded by a Japanese grenade, he led his men along the ridge and, apparently oblivious to the fire-power raining down, closed with the enemy in a bitter hand-to-hand fight.</p> <p>It was an action which won him the Victoria Cross, and as the citation put it, Gaje \"dominated the fight\" with \"his outstanding example, dauntless courage and superb leadership. Hurling grenades and covered in blood from his own wounds, he led assault after assault.\" The young Gurkhas, \"spurred on by the irresistible will of their leader to win, stormed and carried the hill by a magnificent effort and inflicted heavy casualties on the Japanese.\" Having gained the position, Gaje held it, despite continued heavy fire, refusing to have his wounds dressed until ordered to do so by an officer.</p> <p>Born in Barpak village in western Nepal, Gaje, a Gurung of the Ghale tribe, enlisted in the Indian army in 1934. Following training, he joined the 2nd battalion, 5th Royal Gurkha Rifles (Frontier Force), subsequently serving in Waziristan and in operations against that now-forgotten thorn in the side of the British Raj, the Fakir of Ipi. From 1939 to 1942, Gaje served as an instructor at the regimental depot in Abbotabad.</p> <p>With the Japanese invasion of Burma, Gaje's battalion was despatched to Rangoon with the 48th Indian Infantry brigade, joining the 17th Indian Division at the Sittang Bridge in February, 1942. During the seemingly inexorable Japanese advance towards India, Gaje, always at the forefront of the fighting, distinguished himself on numerous occasions as the 17th Indian Division made its heroic withdrawal. Then came his VC-winning action.</p> <p>In 1944 the Viceroy of India, Field Marshal Lord Wavell, presented Gaje Ghale with his VC at an investiture at the Red Fort in Delhi before a crowd of more than 5,000. In 1946, Gaje paid the first of many visits to London, taking part in the victory parade.</p> <p>Following independence in 1947, Gaje, promoted Subadar Major, stayed with his battalion, which became part of the new Indian Army as the 5th Gorkha Rifles. He later saw service with the United Nations in the Congo in 1962-63. On his retirement from active service he was awarded the Star of Nepal at a special ceremony held in Kathmandu.</p> <p>Granted the honorary rank of Captain, Gaje Ghale re tained close links with former regimental colleagues and was a frequent and very welcome guest in Britain, regularly attending reunions of the Victoria Cross and George Cross Association. With other Gurkha VCs, he attended the opening of the Gurkha Museum at Winchester in 1990, and was present at ceremonies marking the 50th anniversary of VJ Day in London in 1995. Those who were privileged to meet this remarkable man will long remember his striking presence and smiling countenance. Gaje Ghale, VC, was, indeed, one of \"The Bravest of the Brave.\"</p> <p>He was married with four sons and five daughters (one of whom predeceased him).</p> <p>Gaje Ghale, VC, soldier, born August 1 1918; died March 28 2000.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In May 1943 Gaje Ghale, who has died aged 81, was serving as a havildar (sergeant) with the 2nd battalion, 5th Royal Gurkha Rifles. It was during the 17th Indian Division's bitter and bloody struggle with the Japanese 33rd Division on the Tiddim Road in Burma, in the final phase of the Indian division's withdrawal through the Chin Hills. The Japanese occupied a crucial position on the Basha East Hill, the approach to which was a narrow ridge little more than 15 ft wide. Two attempts to take the position faltered in the face of withering fire from Japanese machine-gun nests and artillery and mortars concealed in the jungle. On May 25, Gaje, now in command of his company's D platoon, was ordered to take the position. Encouraging his riflemen and shouting the Gurkha's battle-cry \"Ayo Gurkhali!\" (the Gurkhas are upon you), Gaje attacked. Although badly wounded by a Japanese grenade, he led his men along the ridge and, apparently oblivious to the fire-power raining down, closed with the enemy in a bitter hand-to-hand fight. It was an action which won him the Victoria Cross, and as the citation put it, Gaje \"dominated the fight\" with \"his outstanding example, dauntless courage and superb leadership. Hurling grenades and covered in blood from his own wounds, he led assault after assault.\" The young Gurkhas, \"spurred on by the irresistible will of their leader to win, stormed and carried the hill by a magnificent effort and inflicted heavy casualties on the Japanese.\" Having gained the position, Gaje held it, despite continued heavy fire, refusing to have his wounds dressed until ordered to do so by an officer. Born in Barpak village in western Nepal, Gaje, a Gurung of the Ghale tribe, enlisted in the Indian army in 1934. Following training, he joined the 2nd battalion, 5th Royal Gurkha Rifles (Frontier Force), subsequently serving in Waziristan and in operations against that now-forgotten thorn in the side of the British Raj, the Fakir of Ipi. From 1939 to 1942, Gaje served as an instructor at the regimental depot in Abbotabad. With the Japanese invasion of Burma, Gaje's battalion was despatched to Rangoon with the 48th Indian Infantry brigade, joining the 17th Indian Division at the Sittang Bridge in February, 1942. During the seemingly inexorable Japanese advance towards India, Gaje, always at the forefront of the fighting, distinguished himself on numerous occasions as the 17th Indian Division made its heroic withdrawal. Then came his VC-winning action. In 1944 the Viceroy of India, Field Marshal Lord Wavell, presented Gaje Ghale with his VC at an investiture at the Red Fort in Delhi before a crowd of more than 5,000. In 1946, Gaje paid the first of many visits to London, taking part in the victory parade. Following independence in 1947, Gaje, promoted Subadar Major, stayed with his battalion, which became part of the new Indian Army as the 5th Gorkha Rifles. He later saw service with the United Nations in the Congo in 1962-63. On his retirement from active service he was awarded the Star of Nepal at a special ceremony held in Kathmandu. Granted the honorary rank of Captain, Gaje Ghale re tained close links with former regimental colleagues and was a frequent and very welcome guest in Britain, regularly attending reunions of the Victoria Cross and George Cross Association. With other Gurkha VCs, he attended the opening of the Gurkha Museum at Winchester in 1990, and was present at ceremonies marking the 50th anniversary of VJ Day in London in 1995. Those who were privileged to meet this remarkable man will long remember his striking presence and smiling countenance. Gaje Ghale, VC, was, indeed, one of \"The Bravest of the Brave.\" He was married with four sons and five daughters (one of whom predeceased him). Gaje Ghale, VC, soldier, born August 1 1918; died March 28 2000.",

A mask in one hand, a .357 Magnum in the other, an accomplice at his side, he parked in front of the farmhouse and waited.</p> <p>But what turned the bend was a traffic patrol with two curious policemen. They were suspicious when they saw two strangers watching an isolated road. A call to base revealed the Lancia to be stolen. Enzo Baldini stepped from the patrol car and crunched over gravel towards Viccei.</p> <p>He was 30ft away when the strangers raised their revolvers and fired. The first shot missed but three followed. The policeman crumpled as a bullet tore into his leg. He grasped his sub-machine gun as a figure raced towards him, pointing a revolver. Baldini loosed 15 rounds and the figure twirled and toppled. There was no scream; Viccei was dead before he hit the ground.</p> <p>\"I always wanted to reach something that was top of its field,\" he once said, at a peak of glamour and infamy a lifetime away from the moment a terrified traffic cop became his nemesis. His death has shaken Italy. Viccei was not supposed to be sitting armed in a stolen car waiting to ambush a bank security van. He was technically serving time but was allowed out during the day to work in a publisher's office.</p> <p>The story behind Tuesday's shootout may write the epitaph for Italy's penal lenience, for Viccei, 45, was no ordinary gangster. It was he who masterminded the \u00a340m Knightsbridge safe deposit robbery in July 1987, a spectacular heist dubbed the crime of the century. Security guard uniforms, metal cutting equipment, walkie-talkies and the owner's complicity enabled his gang to clear 114 boxes in under two hours. The victims were royalty, celebrities, millionaires and criminals. No shots were fired and no one was injured.</p> <p>Viccei, a playboy and serial seducer, had come to London in search of a big life and he had found it. \"I had a passion for weapons, beautiful women and fast cars,\" he said. When he was caught a few days later at the wheel of his Ferrari, traced by a fingerprint, he became a folk hero. The Italian Stallion, the Wolf, the gentleman thief - he exulted in all his nicknames.</p> <p>In reality, he was an arrogant, vain thug. The son of a libel lawyer and boutique-owning mother from Ascoli Piceno, a town near his final shootout, he craved adulation and never hesitated to use violence. A thief by 16, he went to university in Rome to study philosophy in the 70s but fell under the influence of the neo-fascist terrorist leader Gianni Nardi. He joined the youth group Fronta Della Giuventu, daubing swastikas on public buildings before graduating to bombings. He racked up a suspected 54 robberies as politics became a distant motive.</p> <p>Viccei wanted to be a star. He modelled himself on Al Pacino's Scarface, which he reputedly watched 58 times. He had a gold key-ring in the shape of a shotgun. The combination number for his \u00a3700 Louis Vuitton briefcase was 357, after the .357 Magnum. He moved to Britain in the 1980s and didn't allow broken English to inhibit chasing women or five armed robberies. Once captured, he played the master villain. Suave, athletic, sunglasses, permanent grin, jokes and boasts. Newspapers drooled over his cunning and charm.</p> <p>Less attention was paid to dissenters from the myth. \"I found him boring, showing off his Rolex watch and talking about his fast cars,\" said Justine Marr, secretary to the Parvez Latif, who owned the security deposit. A detective was equally dismissive. \"He wanted to be known as the mastermind of the world's biggest robbery. He has an ego the size of the Old Bailey.\" It mattered not. A star was born. He told the judge: \"Maybe I am a romantic lunatic but money was the last thing on my mind.\" Only \u00a310m was ever recovered.</p> <p>Sentenced to 22 years, he languished in Parkhurst on the Isle of Wight. He wore a T-shirt emblazoned with the slogan \"I love Knightsbridge\" around a clown's face with dollar signs for eyes. Then in November 1992, the Wolf bounded to freedom, although it was called extradition.</p> <p>Under the Treaty of Strasbourg, he was transferred to a jail in Pescara on the Adriatic coast to finish his sentence. Declaring himself a reformed character, he tried to buy freedom by claiming to know the truth about Roberto Calvi, \"God's banker\", who was found hanging under Blackfriars bridge in London in 1982. It was a bluff, but it did not matter. Within three years, he was strolling the beachside cafes on his way to work at a publisher's office, visiting his flat and returning to jail at 10.30 every night.</p> <p>He told Britain: \"The legal system in Italy may look softer than yours but it is not. The only difference is that the rehabilitation programme does not discriminate like in your country.\" An autobiography seemed to complete the rehabilitation and Viccei slid into obscurity, effectively free until gaining parole in 2003. But in prison, he had befriended Antonio Malatesta, a member of the Puglia mafia, known as the Sacred United Heart, which specialises in kidnappings, armed hold-ups and smuggling. Malatesta was also free to roam while serving time because he had become a supergrass (a pentito) which is a fast-track to reduced sentences and priviliges.</p> <p>Italian justice has made supergrasses and rapid releases for \"model prisoners\" central to its fight against organised crime. Since the first mafioso broke the code of omerta in 80s and started talking, thousands have followed. The mafia reeled but cracks are forming. Dozens of prison ers enjoying semi-liberty have been caught murdering and robbing. Pentitis are manipulating prosecutors to ensnare rival clans. Appeals courts are throwing out their testimony. The system is breaking down. Tuesday's shootout could be the last straw. Opposition politicians branded it a scandal. Only by fluke had justice prevailed. They want Viccei's epitaph to be the abolition of supergrasses.</p> <p>Police yesterday said the pair were planning to either rob a bank security van or kidnap a scion from one of the area's three industrialist families. Malatesta tried to flee after they opened fire but was shot, wounded and caught. Viccei, hair flicked with grey, dressed in blue jeans and a green jacket, was said by police to have approached the prostrate Baldini with the intention of finishing him off when the hail of bullets spun him round; he landed on his back, blood seeping from his eyes, nose and mouth.</p> <p>Reinforcements arrived and dozens of police stood above the corpse. None recognised him. The master robber was mistaken for an Albanian bandit. Only hours later was his identity discovered. By Viccei's own criterion, he died a failure: \"The rule of this game is that if they don't catch you, you are a genius. But if they do, you are a miserable nobody.\"</p>",

Enzo Baldini stepped from the patrol car and crunched over gravel towards Viccei. He was 30ft away when the strangers raised their revolvers and fired. The first shot missed but three followed. The policeman crumpled as a bullet tore into his leg. He grasped his sub-machine gun as a figure raced towards him, pointing a revolver. Baldini loosed 15 rounds and the figure twirled and toppled. There was no scream; Viccei was dead before he hit the ground. \"I always wanted to reach something that was top of its field,\" he once said, at a peak of glamour and infamy a lifetime away from the moment a terrified traffic cop became his nemesis. His death has shaken Italy. Viccei was not supposed to be sitting armed in a stolen car waiting to ambush a bank security van. He was technically serving time but was allowed out during the day to work in a publisher's office. The story behind Tuesday's shootout may write the epitaph for Italy's penal lenience, for Viccei, 45, was no ordinary gangster. It was he who masterminded the \u00a340m Knightsbridge safe deposit robbery in July 1987, a spectacular heist dubbed the crime of the century. Security guard uniforms, metal cutting equipment, walkie-talkies and the owner's complicity enabled his gang to clear 114 boxes in under two hours. The victims were royalty, celebrities, millionaires and criminals. No shots were fired and no one was injured. Viccei, a playboy and serial seducer, had come to London in search of a big life and he had found it. \"I had a passion for weapons, beautiful women and fast cars,\" he said. When he was caught a few days later at the wheel of his Ferrari, traced by a fingerprint, he became a folk hero. The Italian Stallion, the Wolf, the gentleman thief - he exulted in all his nicknames. In reality, he was an arrogant, vain thug. The son of a libel lawyer and boutique-owning mother from Ascoli Piceno, a town near his final shootout, he craved adulation and never hesitated to use violence. A thief by 16, he went to university in Rome to study philosophy in the 70s but fell under the influence of the neo-fascist terrorist leader Gianni Nardi. He joined the youth group Fronta Della Giuventu, daubing swastikas on public buildings before graduating to bombings. He racked up a suspected 54 robberies as politics became a distant motive. Viccei wanted to be a star. He modelled himself on Al Pacino's Scarface, which he reputedly watched 58 times. He had a gold key-ring in the shape of a shotgun. The combination number for his \u00a3700 Louis Vuitton briefcase was 357, after the .357 Magnum. He moved to Britain in the 1980s and didn't allow broken English to inhibit chasing women or five armed robberies. Once captured, he played the master villain. Suave, athletic, sunglasses, permanent grin, jokes and boasts. Newspapers drooled over his cunning and charm. Less attention was paid to dissenters from the myth. \"I found him boring, showing off his Rolex watch and talking about his fast cars,\" said Justine Marr, secretary to the Parvez Latif, who owned the security deposit. A detective was equally dismissive. \"He wanted to be known as the mastermind of the world's biggest robbery. He has an ego the size of the Old Bailey.\" It mattered not. A star was born. He told the judge: \"Maybe I am a romantic lunatic but money was the last thing on my mind.\" Only \u00a310m was ever recovered. Sentenced to 22 years, he languished in Parkhurst on the Isle of Wight. He wore a T-shirt emblazoned with the slogan \"I love Knightsbridge\" around a clown's face with dollar signs for eyes. Then in November 1992, the Wolf bounded to freedom, although it was called extradition. Under the Treaty of Strasbourg, he was transferred to a jail in Pescara on the Adriatic coast to finish his sentence. Declaring himself a reformed character, he tried to buy freedom by claiming to know the truth about Roberto Calvi, \"God's banker\", who was found hanging under Blackfriars bridge in London in 1982. It was a bluff, but it did not matter. Within three years, he was strolling the beachside cafes on his way to work at a publisher's office, visiting his flat and returning to jail at 10.30 every night. He told Britain: \"The legal system in Italy may look softer than yours but it is not. The only difference is that the rehabilitation programme does not discriminate like in your country.\" An autobiography seemed to complete the rehabilitation and Viccei slid into obscurity, effectively free until gaining parole in 2003. But in prison, he had befriended Antonio Malatesta, a member of the Puglia mafia, known as the Sacred United Heart, which specialises in kidnappings, armed hold-ups and smuggling. Malatesta was also free to roam while serving time because he had become a supergrass (a pentito) which is a fast-track to reduced sentences and priviliges. Italian justice has made supergrasses and rapid releases for \"model prisoners\" central to its fight against organised crime. Since the first mafioso broke the code of omerta in 80s and started talking, thousands have followed. The mafia reeled but cracks are forming. Dozens of prison ers enjoying semi-liberty have been caught murdering and robbing. Pentitis are manipulating prosecutors to ensnare rival clans. Appeals courts are throwing out their testimony. The system is breaking down. Tuesday's shootout could be the last straw. Opposition politicians branded it a scandal. Only by fluke had justice prevailed. They want Viccei's epitaph to be the abolition of supergrasses. Police yesterday said the pair were planning to either rob a bank security van or kidnap a scion from one of the area's three industrialist families. Malatesta tried to flee after they opened fire but was shot, wounded and caught. Viccei, hair flicked with grey, dressed in blue jeans and a green jacket, was said by police to have approached the prostrate Baldini with the intention of finishing him off when the hail of bullets spun him round; he landed on his back, blood seeping from his eyes, nose and mouth. Reinforcements arrived and dozens of police stood above the corpse. None recognised him. The master robber was mistaken for an Albanian bandit. Only hours later was his identity discovered. By Viccei's own criterion, he died a failure: \"The rule of this game is that if they don't catch you, you are a genius. But if they do, you are a miserable nobody.\"",

Of course there were cracks that had to be papered over - but that is in the nature of a peace negotiation. By the end, standing in the Easter snow, men who had once been blood enemies stood together, having brokered a new way to live together.

There are no glimpses of negotiating teams hugging in Castle Buildings, no Sinn Fein spokesmen emerging to declare \"a beautiful day\". Instead the Good Friday agreement is on life support, each one of the parties who ought to be propping it up feeling shaky. The Ulster Unionist leader is hemmed in by a party that has almost given up on him and on the peace process. At their last council meeting they voted to have nothing to do with self-rule - a cornerstone of the agreement - unless the IRA gave up its guns and London abandoned its plans to rename the Royal Ulster Constabulary. Against that backdrop, and surrounded by party bigwigs plotting against him - and a former UUP activist threatening to challenge him in his own parliamentary seat - there is little movement David Trimble can make. He could offer a concession - only to have his party refuse to budge. Most observers reckon the UUP leader can only go back to his party with a back-me-or-sack-me ultimatum once more. He cannot waste that one shot.</p> <p>The republican side is looking slightly stronger, but it too has problems. At the last party conference, hardliner Gerry McGeough was elected to a senior post: that seemed like a warning to Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness that the fundamentalists have not gone away. The IRA ceasefire is safe, but the organisation is not about to hand over its arsenal any time soon.</p> <p>One other player is also looking peaky. The secretary of state, Peter Mandelson, is now under constant attack from both sides. Unionists are angry at recent speeches which they have interpreted as pressure to drop their demand for IRA guns. Republicans still cannot forgive his February decision to collapse the executive. On one thing both sides agree: Mr Mandelson, they say, is too touchy, too concerned with his own image to cope in the gloves-off politics of Northern Ireland. Many interpreted Tony Blair's visit to Belfast this week as a sign that the prime minister felt he had to step in, to get a grip on the situation himself.</p> <p>Despite all that, the optimists have not quite given up. They note that Mr Blair and the Irish prime minister Bertie Ahern are due to meet again today, in London: that would not happen unless they had something to say to each other. Dublin has been working hard to get the IRA to build on the more constructive statement it gave to John de Chastelain's commission on decommissioning in February. There are reports of progress - persuading republicans not only to produce new language (\"the war is over\") but deeds, too. This might have been what Mr Blair wanted to float with Mr Trimble in their talks on Tuesday. Either way, all those who believe that April 1998 represented Northern Ireland's best chance in a generation should not give up hope just yet. Good Friday once brought good luck to Northern Ireland - it just might do it again.</p>",

Against that backdrop, and surrounded by party bigwigs plotting against him - and a former UUP activist threatening to challenge him in his own parliamentary seat - there is little movement David Trimble can make. He could offer a concession - only to have his party refuse to budge. Most observers reckon the UUP leader can only go back to his party with a back-me-or-sack-me ultimatum once more. He cannot waste that one shot. The republican side is looking slightly stronger, but it too has problems. At the last party conference, hardliner Gerry McGeough was elected to a senior post: that seemed like a warning to Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness that the fundamentalists have not gone away. The IRA ceasefire is safe, but the organisation is not about to hand over its arsenal any time soon. One other player is also looking peaky. The secretary of state, Peter Mandelson, is now under constant attack from both sides. Unionists are angry at recent speeches which they have interpreted as pressure to drop their demand for IRA guns. Republicans still cannot forgive his February decision to collapse the executive. On one thing both sides agree: Mr Mandelson, they say, is too touchy, too concerned with his own image to cope in the gloves-off politics of Northern Ireland. Many interpreted Tony Blair's visit to Belfast this week as a sign that the prime minister felt he had to step in, to get a grip on the situation himself. Despite all that, the optimists have not quite given up. They note that Mr Blair and the Irish prime minister Bertie Ahern are due to meet again today, in London: that would not happen unless they had something to say to each other. Dublin has been working hard to get the IRA to build on the more constructive statement it gave to John de Chastelain's commission on decommissioning in February. There are reports of progress - persuading republicans not only to produce new language (\"the war is over\") but deeds, too. This might have been what Mr Blair wanted to float with Mr Trimble in their talks on Tuesday. Either way, all those who believe that April 1998 represented Northern Ireland's best chance in a generation should not give up hope just yet. Good Friday once brought good luck to Northern Ireland - it just might do it again.",

The woman, whose initial is J, had no connection with Dando, but the man tried to extract as much information as he could. \"It was a very polite, respectful call,\" he said. \"She described him as a white person with no foreign accent.\" That call was made in December 1998 but calls to the utilities made by a man claiming to be Dando's brother were made in February 1999. Dando, 37, was killed by a single bullet to the head outside her home in Fulham, west London almost a year ago Last night, police used the BBC Crimewatch programme to appeal for information about a new suspect, and to ask Dando's killer to give himself up. Mr Campbell said he thought the killer was waiting near Dando's home on the day of the murder for an opportunity to strike. The programme focused on a man seen hanging around near Dando's home before she died and on two previous Mondays. A dozen witnesses say they saw a man in his 30s to 40s, wearing a dark suit, who appeared agitated. Mr Campbell said of the killer: \"I cannot say whether his fixation is transferred to someone else.

      "bodyText": "Paul Barber (Letters, April 19) believes he does not become a bogus job seeker just because his application is rejected. But that presumes he has not misrepresented himself. If he applied for a job as a graphic designer when he was, in fact, an electrician, then he would be a bogus graphic designer. To qualify as a genuine asylum seeker you must have a well-founded fear of persecution. Those who make unsubstantiated claims are guilty of masquerading. They are bogus asylum seekers. Alistair McConnachie Glasgow \u0095 The BNP's statement for its London mayoral candidate makes liberal use of the Tory's description of asylum seekers as \"bogus\". No mention of detention camps yet though. Well done, Mr Hague, \"clear blue water\" between the Tories and the BNP. Saul Walker London saul.walker@nat.org.uk \u0095 Tony Blair leads a Labour party which presented a bogus platform at the last election. Fortunately they have to apply again and their application can then be rejected. Paul Knutson Northwood, Middx paul@knutson.demon.co.uk \u0095 Would supporters of women who wish to breastfeed in Commons' committees (MPs to challenge breastfeeding ban, April 15 and Oona King MP's letter, April 18) want a surgeon to be breastfeeding while she was carrying out an operation? Or an airline pilot in the middle of a flight? Why then permit MPs, whose work affects the lives of so many more people, to have their concentration divided? Catriona Graham Edinburgh \u0095 I was interested to read \"dubber\" meant a lady of ill repute (Letters, April 14).

The results of DNA tests on a heart (right, in its crystal vase container) presumed to be his contradict the myth that the boy - the son of Louis XVI and Queen Marie-Antoinette - did not die of TB but was smuggled out of prison after his parents were guillotined, and that another child's body was placed in his bed. It is claimed that he then founded a new dynasty before dying in Holland in 1845. The legend has led to claims by at least 100 pretenders to the Bourbon regal inheritance. Thousands of articles and 600 books have kept the myth alive, but the geneticists, Jean-Jacques Cassiman and Bernd Brinkmann, said that DNA from the heart matched samples from locks of hair cut from Marie-Antoinette. Although royal pretenders believe that the heart, which resembles a piece of dark stone, had been mishandled over the years and could not provide proof, the genetic evidence appeared to be conclusive. The historian Philippe Delorme, who launched the affair, said science had confirmed the verdict of history, and there was no doubt that it was the boy-king who died in 1795. \"There is no longer an enigma around Louis XVII.\" The results of earlier examinations had already persuaded Prof Cassiman, from Louvain University in Belgium, and Prof Brinkmann, from M\u00fcnster University in Germany, that the most likely living pretender, Charles de Bourbon, Duke of Normandy, was not related to the royal family. Among the many previous investigators was the late French president Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, who went to Germany and Holland in a failed attempt to disprove the story that the royalist doctor who carried out a post-mortem examination on the boy in 1795 saved the heart when the rest of the body was thrown into a common grave. The heart, which the doctor pickled, was later stolen by a medical student, and when it was eventually recovered it was rejected by the Bourbon family as a fake.

Traffic will be a problem if the weather is fine or foul, according to AA Roadwatch. If it is sunny, roads to the coast and countryside will be choked with traffic, but if it is raining, motorists will head to shopping malls instead. Problems have been exacerbated by the combination of a very late Easter break and the May bank holiday the following week which means many people have extended their holidays. Among the most congested motorways will be the M25 near Heathrow, the A40 and M4 heading out of London and the M6 around Birmingham. Traffic will also be brought to a standstill on the M1 in Hertfordshire and on main routes to the Metro centre, Gateshead, and the Meadowhall centre in Sheffield. Michael Johnson, of AA Roadwatch, said: \"The problem is there is no way around this traffic unless you take the very bold step of breaking with tradition and staying at home.\" Many roadworks have been suspended by the highways agency to avoid further snarl-ups on the motorways. A spokesman for Trafficmaster, a traffic information company, said it expected holiday routes to become busy from 1pm today, particularly the M5 from the west midlands, the A31 towards the Hampshire and Dorset coast, routes towards the west country, the A55 along the north Wales coast and around the M55 junction with the M6 north of Preston.

      "bodyText": "Thirteen Lebanese detainees released by Israel headed home yesterday after Red Cross officials escorted them out of the Israeli occupation zone in south Lebanon. Hundreds of joyful relatives and villagers mobbed the bus carrying the men into the frontline village of Kfar Tibnit, 50 miles south-east of Beirut, which was decked out with flags and welcoming banners. The release came an hour after the Israeli high court rejected a last-minute petition from the relatives of a missing Israeli airman to keep the Lebanese as bargaining counters for a possible swap. The men, held without trial for more than a decade, were turned over by prison officials to the Israeli army, which handed them on to the Red Cross over at the border town of Metulla. The army, fearing possible artillery fire from the zone, kept relatives well clear of the checkpoint, since villagers on the fringes of the occupied area are often caught in the crossfire. Before their arrival, locals festooned the streets of Kfar Tibnit with Lebanese flags and banners, as excited and anxious relatives of the detainees' milled about clutching pictures and bouquets. Although an Israeli court ruling last week made it illegal for Israel to hold prisoners for barter, the release had been delayed twice and could have been postponed again if the court had approved the petition by the family of the missing Israeli airman Ron Arad. Despite the uncertainty, local politicians and officials held court in the village, while members of Hizbullah, whose guerrillas are fighting Israel's occupation of the south, bussed scores of supporters to the site to set up speakers broadcasting patriotic anthems. \"I've been waiting to hug him for 13 years. I can't imagine it,\" said Zeinab Yassin, whose brother Mohammed was among those released. \"I just can't put my feelings into words.\" Lebanese human rights groups say the detainees were taken during clashes with Israeli troops and their militia allies, the South Lebanon Army, or snatched from their homes in the occupied zone. \"He's the hero of heroes and I am so proud of him,\" said Amal, the fiancee of detainee Ahmed Taleb. \"Isn't it enough that he fought against the enemy and is now coming home?\" But not all who gathered at Kfar Tibnit were joyful.

A campaign led by Oxfam is calling on the conference to adopt an $8bn (\u00a35.1bn) programme aimed at getting the 125m children who are out of school in the third world into the classroom. \"The governments, UN agencies and World Bank officials attending the forum have all identified education as the key to human development,\" an Oxfam official said. \"All of them have made high-sounding pronouncements on the need for a renewed effort to achieve education for all. \"Yet they have collectively failed to display the vision and commitment needed to translate good principles into practice.\"",

What is this great invention that will grip the nation? It is the electronic or e-book. </p> <p>The technology was thrown into the limelight recently when horror writer, Stephen King, decided to publish his latest novella, Riding the Bullet, exclusively on the internet, a decision that sent shock waves through the $70bn (\u00a344.6bn) publishing industry. Within the first 24 hours of the promotion Barnes and Noble received more than 200,000 requests for the novella. That's the equivalent of selling 2.5 books per second. Check out the Barnes and Noble library on the internet at www.bn.com and you will find a whole selection of them. On-screen there's little to distinguish them from the printed word but they are a lot harder to read on a computer display or liquid crystal display (LCD), hence King published a novella rather than a full-blown novel.</p> <p>BN has provided software designed to make the e-books easier to read: download the imaginatively titled e-book reader and the Glassbook reader from the site and install them for what the company claims is a paper-like display. </p> <p>You can also purchase a Rocket Book device to carry the e-books around. Software mogul, Bill Gates, has already recognised the potential of the technology and Microsoft's researchers have produced similar software designed to give a paper-like quality to text on an electronic screen, called ClearType font-enhancing technology.</p> <p>The software was designed following a study of how letters and words appear on the printed page and attempts to recreate those images on-screen. \"It fixes the problem of word recognition,\" says Scottish born Bill Hill, one of the co-inventors of ClearType, who hit upon the idea while animal tracking in America. \"Animal tracking is a bit like reading. If you recognise the pattern it's easy. But if it isn't clear enough or sharp enough we have to work it out,\" he says. </p> <p>Hill believes that the impact of ClearType and technology like it will have as dramatic a social impact as the dawn of the first printing press. \"The move towards screen readable information will change society just as much as the invention of the printing press but it will do it in five years rather than 500,\" he says.</p> <p>But even Hill will admit that there's a lot more to be done before we'll want to read an entire novel on-screen. \"The book is a most complex technology. It is the most mature information interface that we have and in order to understand how it works we have to do a lot more.\"</p> <p>Others agree that the Rocket Book/ClearType approach is primitive. \"Electronic books that you can buy right now such as the Rocket Book are still, from a technological point of view, using existing technology. It is basically just a laptop computer with a standard LCD display,\" says Pierre Wiltzius, technical manager for Lucent/Bell Labs.</p> <p>Is there an alternative? Imagine a substance that looks and feels like paper, with the qualities of a computer screen, allows you to download electronic content but which you can roll-up and put in your pocket. If you think it sounds like science fiction, think again - Xerox, the document company, believes it has come up with exactly that. What's more it won't even require a separate power source while you read it.</p> <p>The basis of this e-paper already exists in the company's Palo Alto Research Centre (Parc), ironically, the same outfit that brought us the laser printer, in the form of an electronic pulp called Gyricon. Gyricon is basically a thin sheet of plastic made up of millions of tiny beads, a bit like the toner particles found in traditional printers.</p> <p>The beads are double-sided, one black and one white. Each fits loosely into its own oil-filled cavity and still has the freedom to rotate. Electricity passed through the Gyricon causes the beads to rotate, showing either their black or white side in a series of patterns that form words and/or pictures. </p> <p>Only a small charge is needed to \"print\" on the paper. The researchers at Parc claim that it is possible to create a printer-type device to do the trick that would be small enough to fit into your wallet or purse. The company even has plans to weave further magic with its own design for an electronic \"wand\", a tube that acts as a printer, copier, fax and scanner in one.</p> <p>Other solutions are on the horizon too from Lucent/Bell Labs. The company's goal is to replace the expensive silicon-based technology used in the Rocket Book with a plastic that it says will look and feel like paper. </p> <p>\"Our goal is to make a paper-like film that is as flexible and easy to read as ink on paper,\" says Wiltzius. He also hopes his plastic will be 100 times cheaper than the silicon chip based readers. Lucent is not stopping with electronic paper. The company hopes its paper-like film will work with a separate technological development, called E-Ink, invented by an American start-up of the same name. Electronic Ink is a coloured liquid made up of millions of tiny spheres called microcapsules.</p> <p> Each microcapsule has a clear outer surface and is filled with a blue dye and microscopic chips of white pigment which carry a positive charge. The ink is sandwiched between two transparent conductive sheets and the white pigment is made to rise or fall by electronic charges, creating blue or white dots which can be formed into letters and pictures.

They could be on widespread display later this year. </p> <p>When will you be leafing through your electronic Guardian? The answer could be sooner than you think. Xerox claims it has already had a lot of interest from the newspaper publishing community. \"There's been a large amount of interest from the newspaper publishing companies to find alternative methods of publishing. In the case of paper there's a lot of cost in print and distribution,\" says Nick Sheridon, developer of Gyricon.</p> <p>Microsoft has started to address the wider issues of copyright protection and is planning a range of products that will offer \"digital rights management to protect internet property,\" according to Hill. A 5,000-year-old technology will not be replaced overnight, but an electronic alternative is just around the corner.

      "body": "<p>Crouching on the floor of the Photographers' Gallery in central London are a tousled man in his 60s and a younger woman with glasses and blonde hair tied in a ponytail. The Ukrainian photographer Boris Mikhailov and his second wife, Vita, are poring over a giant, photographic poster of a homeless man with a diseased penis. </p> <p>\"Boris is very nervous about the show. He's in the middle of an argument with his wife about where the pictures should go - he wanted to hang all his own work,\" explains the curator, Jeremy Millar, the day before the show opens. In other words, our interview is off. Mikhailov, with his deep, dancing eyes, gets up to shake my hand and then disappears. Vita was to have acted as translator. </p> <p>There is something incongruous about the way this ageing man in his cheap clothes has been given free rein to scrabble on the floor of a smart, paint-fresh gallery. Mikhailov, who for 30 years has explored the role of the individual within the ideology of the state (communist and now capitalist), seems dwarfed by fashionable London.

      "bodyText": "Crouching on the floor of the Photographers' Gallery in central London are a tousled man in his 60s and a younger woman with glasses and blonde hair tied in a ponytail. The Ukrainian photographer Boris Mikhailov and his second wife, Vita, are poring over a giant, photographic poster of a homeless man with a diseased penis. \"Boris is very nervous about the show. He's in the middle of an argument with his wife about where the pictures should go - he wanted to hang all his own work,\" explains the curator, Jeremy Millar, the day before the show opens. In other words, our interview is off. Mikhailov, with his deep, dancing eyes, gets up to shake my hand and then disappears. Vita was to have acted as translator. There is something incongruous about the way this ageing man in his cheap clothes has been given free rein to scrabble on the floor of a smart, paint-fresh gallery. Mikhailov, who for 30 years has explored the role of the individual within the ideology of the state (communist and now capitalist), seems dwarfed by fashionable London. Just as the homeless subjects of his 1999 Case History series - made to reveal the nakedness of their neglected and deformed bodies - are lost in the brutal new world that is capitalism in the former USSR. In Case Study, homeless people drag away animal carcasses to chew; children sniff glue; sexual or physical abuse and death are omnipresent. The red of wounds leaks into snow before the vulgar red backdrop of Coca-Cola ads, which have replaced the red communist slogans and banners of Mikhailov's earlier work.

      "body": "<p>Ute Lemper has become inextricably linked with Kurt Weill and the cabaret songs of the Weimar Republic, yet pinning her down is like trying to cram a mattress into the neck of a wine bottle. The New York Times captured one aspect of her performing self with the observation, \"Ms Lemper gleefully carries the role of cabaret singer to the edge of stylised madness\", but that's only part of the story. She'll add a new chapter when she brings the songs from her recent album, Punishing Kiss, to British stages at the beginning of May. For once, these will be pieces by current writers, including Tom Waits, Nick Cave, Elvis Costello and The Divine Comedy, rather than music written under the gathering storm of Nazi Germany. </p> <p>In conversation with the woman, you get the impression that inside that impossibly long, slim body, there are at least half a dozen Lempers trying to get out. She delivers a string of tirades and monologues, as she rages about her pet hates and obsessions then soberly evaluates her life and career. </p> <p>For instance, she hates the two-faced smugness of the Royal Family. She watched Sarah Ferguson being interviewed on CNN by Larry King, and saw red. \"She says, 'I respect and honour the royal family', but she doesn't at all,\" snaps Lemper. \"Why doesn't she say, 'I think the royal family is infamous. They are mean people, they caused a lot of pain for Diana and me, and they're racists' - there are no black people working at Buckingham Palace. Why doesn't she just say this? She's hypocritical for the sake of her fucking title. It's just unbearable.\" </p> <p>In Lemper-world, Hitler and the Nazis come in for regular hammerings, as do Germany and German culture in general. The hypocrisy and closet anti-semitism of the British also get her goat. So does the new financial apartheid she sees developing in Europe, as the rich EU countries gang up against the smaller ones with unreliable currencies. What French audiences consider to be humour is a perpetual source of bafflement to her. It's some kind of therapy: she deals with her emotions by ranting them to a standstill. </p> <p>She can't understand why the British critics put the boot into her one-woman show, Life's a Swindle, when she brought it to the Queen's Theatre in London last year. In her mind, she can still see rows of repressed middle-aged men scrawling derogatory comments. \"The show worked really well in the US and in Paris, and the only bad reviews I got were here in England,\" she grumbles. \"In the first week, I got this very stiff-upper-lip British conservative audience who didn't know what the heck was happening with that show, because it was so outside the conventions of a West End performance. But in the second week I got a great audience, I got the real hip and groovy funky people.\" </p> <p>The choice of words is a giveaway here. Behind her cool and haughty exterior, which makes her look like the killer queen of old Berlin, a large chunk of Lemper is an old-fashioned radical with hippy tendencies. Born in Munster in the mid-60s, she found herself suffering - not unlike Germany itself - from a divided soul. As she grew up, Germany was beginning to reassert itself after its period of post-war reconstruction, but Lemper has always felt conflicting emotions about her homeland, and has looked outwards to France, Britain and the United States. Her marriage to the Jewish writer and comedian David Tabatsky, with whom she lives in New York with their two children, was an implicit condemnation of everything she disliked about Germany. </p> <p>Her attachment to the works of Brecht and Weill grew out of the same soil. \"Brecht had all those spirits I was looking for. He was violent sometimes. He created a universe of sailors and whores and love and passion and the outcasts of society, again always anti-establishment and anti-capitalism. It expressed a lot of what I wanted to express while I was growing up.\" </p> <p>Life's a Swindle marked a change of direction for Lemper. She admits that the first night was heavy with her most intimate neuroses, especially the long monologue about a return trip she made to Germany and her attempt to throw off the baggage of her Catholic upbringing, but the most striking aspect was its acid humour. Lemper has always viewed the world darkly and through a distorting lens, but finally she was finding a way of expressing that in direct, personal terms, not just through performances of other writers' material. </p> <p>\"David has really helped me a lot,\" she explains. \"I only took the role of Velma Kelly in Chicago because he convinced me to do it. He said, 'It will be fine, I'll run the household. Do this, it will be good for you.' Plus he encouraged me to explore comedy and introduce humour into a performance, which I wouldn't do 10 years ago. So I'm proud of the Life's a Swindle show, because in the end it did find its audience. I'm even proud of the bad reviews because they proved the show was anti-conservative and these reviewers were pretty conservative - though I'll acknowledge there were a couple of mistakes on the first night.\" </p> <p>Lemper's forthcoming Punishing Kiss performances will see her in a different guise. The album was the fruition of a long-cherished ambition to break away from the Weimar Republic and record some more modern songs. \"I was always hoping that this might happen, but sometimes I don't seize the initiative enough to say, 'Right, this has to happen now!' \" Lemper admits. \"There are always so many other projects waiting on my doorstep, usually in the cabaret or contemporary classical fields.\" </p> <p>While she enjoyed recording the new songs, her main goal was to find material for performance. It's in front of a live audience that Lemper feels she really finds herself. </p> <p>\"What I love so much about the stage is that you are isolated and you go down to the naked nothing of existence,\" she explains. \"You go into the dark areas of life, and all questions are there. Where do I go? Where do I come from? Why are relationships not working out? Why am I so isolated even though I live inside a big society? That's really why I want to perform. OK, you can give the schtick and the fun and the movement, but I need to go all the way down to that deep dark area. That is when I become fulfilled as a performer.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Ute Lemper plays the Royal Festival Hall, London SE1 (020-7960 4242), on May 3, and Bridgewater Hall, Manchester (0161-907 9000), on May 5.</p>",

It's a slim book compared with familiar blockbusters about Apple, IBM, Microsoft and other industry powers, but it tells a story that few people know. </p> <p> Like hundreds of Silicon Valley success stories from Sun Microsystems to Yahoo!, Cisco started at Stanford University in Palo Alto, Califor nia. In the early 1980s, the campus had thousands of computers connected together in networks, but no convenient way of connecting the separate networks together. Working without permission and without an official budget, Sandy Lerner, director of computing at the Stanford University Business School, her boyfriend Len Bosack and other engineers just went ahead and did it. Sandy and Len didn't invent routers - which basically work like electronic post offices, forwarding packets of data instead of packets of paper. </p> <p>They didn't invent TCP/IP, the internet protocol that defines how the packets travel. They didn't write the interface software that made the whole thing run. But they did help create a system that got an incredibly useful job done. When word of their success spread across the internet, other universities and some businesses wanted to use Stanford's \"black box\" to solve the same problem. However, the university wasn't interested in supplying demand, nor did it want Sandy and Len using its facilities for that purpose. So late in 1984, the couple mortgaged their house and used their credit cards to start 'cisco (with a small c in those days) in their living room at 199 Oak Grove Avenue, Atherton, California. Sandy based the company logo on the Golden Gate bridge. Cisco was a success, but the founders soon lost control. Their venture capitalist backer, Don Valentine, brought in a management team, and in 1990, seven vice presidents presented him with an ultimatum: it was Sandy or them. </p> <p>Sandy was out, and Len quit soon afterwards. But at that point, the man most responsible for making Cisco a superpower, John Thomas Chambers, hadn't even joined the company. Chambers, a former IBM salesman, turned Cisco from a company with only 500 employees and annual sales of $183m in 1991 into today's powerhouse, with 21,000 employees and sales worth about $15bn a year. (It reported $8.3bn in sales for the last six months of 1999.) </p> <p> One of the secrets of Chambers' success has been to expand rapidly by buying in new technologies. He's become known for paying very high prices for small start-up companies - in one case, Cerent, it came to $25m per employee. Manda Rigby, the UK director of marketing, says: \"We don't buy people for large market share, we don't buy them to take competitive technologies out and then not develop them, we buy young companies with cutting-edge technology, and we buy people.\" </p> <p> Rigby reckons that Cisco has taken over 57 companies, including 11 so far this year. But, she adds, about 75% of the former chief executives whose companies have been taken over are still with Cisco, \"and it can't be because they need the money\". </p> <p> The idea is simple: find out what customers need next and buy the best of the companies starting to supply it. Or in Cisco's case, buy half a dozen of them, if necessary. But it requires an agnosticism that, at crucial times, has proven beyond all too many technology companies, including IBM and Apple. Unlike them, Cisco has not fought religious wars based on an arrogant belief in its own superiority, to the detriment of its customers' businesses. </p> <p> Of course, Cisco does have a \"big idea\": its belief in the ultimate triumph of IP, the internet protocol. Chambers bet the company on the success of the internet, and the belief that it would subsume or displace other forms of networking. Big bet, big win. The question now is whether Cisco can expand its dominance of internet technologies both downwards into the small business/home market, and upwards into the telecommunications business. In the small business/home market, Cisco will eventually run into Intel, which has earmarked networking as a major area for its future growth. Indeed, Intel wants to commoditise the networking business by providing cheap \"building block\" technologies that will do the same jobs as high-priced equipment like Cisco's. Intel wants to make it as easy to assemble routers, hubs and switches as it is to assemble PCs. </p> <p> In the telecommunications market, Cisco will run into industry giants such as Lucent (formerly part of the US phone company, AT&amp;T) and Nortel (originally the Canadian phone company, Northern Telecom). Although \"pure IP\" networks - carrying voice calls as well as data - might be the future, the phone companies have already invested billions in existing systems using different technologies, such as ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode communications). </p> <p> They aren't going to throw it out, and it takes them decades to update their infrastructure. As Bunnell points out: \"The internet industry in which Cisco thrives is built on a tradition of rapid development at the expense of reliability and tolerance of flaws that would be insufferable in the phone industry.\" Like Intel and Microsoft, its business has been built on the rapid development and deployment of new features, rather than fixing the technology for years and concentrating on reliability. Still, Chambers believes the world's networks are going to converge into one giant, global telecommunications system carrying voice, data and anything else that can be digitised. Maybe Cisco won't end up with 80% of it, but it wont be for want of trying. </p> <p> \u0095 Making the Cisco Connection: The Story Behind the Real Internet Superpower by David Bunnell (John Wiley &amp; Sons, \u00a316.50).</p>",

Takeuchi says that incorporating this smog-eating material into construction components such as cladding for high-rise buildings could act as a pollution sponge, soaking up noxious gases from even the most heavily polluted cities. Sunlight, on the cloudiest of winter days, is enough, he claims, to make the material work. The panels would in effect be self-cleaning and so stay white. At the chemical level, the graphite, which is powdered to produce an enormous surface area in a small volume, acts as a sponge absorbing the pollutants from the air. </p> <p>The titanium dioxide activated by UV light from the sun releases highly reactive oxygen and hydroxy \"radicals\" - molecules with an extra electron. These radicals race around inside the material reacting with the absorbed pollutant molecules and zapping them into non-volatile acids. </p> <p>But what about getting rid of the acids? The material regenerates itself when it comes into contact with water, so when it rains the acids are flushed off into gutters where they can be neutralised by addition of alkali lime in the drainage inlet system, leaving refreshed walls ready to eat yet more smog.

      "body": "<p>One balmy summer night in August a man awoke in his home near the Turkish city of Izmit. Feeling thirsty and unable to sleep he roused his wife and they took coffee on the balcony. </p> <p>Suddenly a loud and growing rumbling shattered the stillness of the early hours. The building shook and swayed and the couple had to grasp the parapet to avoid being hurled to their deaths. </p> <p>As the terrible cacophony reached a climax, the ground beneath rose and fell in waves and the whole building began to fall forward. Thinking their end had come the couple prayed for deliverance. </p> <p>Their prayers were answered. The front of the balcony softly touched the ground and the tilting ceased, allowing the pair to step off and run to safety. </p> <p>The second they had left, the building suddenly came alive again, tilting backwards this time until it stood straight and proud once more. Then it collapsed like a pack of cards, killing instantly or incarcerating the dozens of less favoured families left inside. </p> <p>An extraordinary scene, but just one of many played out on the night of August 17 1999, when a terrible earthquake, registering 7.4 on the Richter Scale, struck north west Turkey a hundred miles east of Istanbul. </p> <p>Within seconds, tens of thousands of buildings were reduced to rubble or severely damaged, killing almost 20,000 people and injuring countless others. It was the 11th most lethal quake of the 20th century. </p> <p>Economically too it took an enormous toll. Some estimates put the cost at more than 10% of Turkey's GDP. </p> <p>The quake should have come as no surprise. The region around Izmit straddles the 1,600km long North Anatolian Fault, a weakness in the crust that mark's the boundary between two of the earth's plates. </p> <p>Time and time again over the last hundred years this fault has ruptured, generating eight destructive earthquakes - in excess of magnitude seven on the Richter Scale - that have crept ominously closer and closer towards the great urban sprawl of Istanbul. Following the Izmit quake, and another almost as large that shook the Ducze region three months later, all the active segments of the North Anatolian Fault have now ruptured, except that beneath the Sea of Marmara - directly south of Istanbul. </p> <p>Given this picture it is not surprising that the Turkish authorities and the population of Istanbul are seriously worried about the safety of this great city. Istanbul has been rocked before by major earthquakes - the last in 1766. Then, as now, the event was preceded by a sequence of quakes that worked their way along the North Anatolian Fault from the east, and another occurred in the Izmit region just decades before the last Istanbul quake. </p> <p>Geologists point out that a 160km stretch of the North Anatolian Fault beneath the Sea of Marmara has been accumulating stress since 1766. This is sufficient to trigger a displacement along the fault of five and a half metres - easily enough to generate an earthquake at least as big as that which flattened Izmit last year. </p> <p>It seems inevitable then that Istanbul will succumb to a major earthquake, possibly sometime in the next few decades. But how will it and its people fare? The omens from the Izmit quake are not good. Because of the continuous seismic threat, building codes are in force to ensure that structures are capable of surviving the magnitude 7 plus quakes that regularly rock the north of the country. </p> <p>Unfortunately the Izmit experience showed that having the codes in place is simply not sufficient to avoid catastrophe. They must also be enforced. At Izmit and in the surrounding urban centres, thousands of apartment blocks that should have stood relatively firm were reduced to rubble with ease, burying all inside and yielding few survivors. It was not long before the reasons for this became apparent. </p> <p>The building boom of the last few decades - driven by the rapid growth of the Turkish economy - had led to a proliferation of cowboy builders and methods. Cheap or inappropriate materials were used, walls and floors were not sufficiently tied together, and housing inspectors turned a blind eye - perhaps aided by a little greasing of palms - to what would turn out to be the lethal cutting of costs and corners. </p> <p>In the aftermath of the catastrophe it was not too difficult to spot the irresponsible builders as little evidence of their labours remained.

      "bodyText": "One balmy summer night in August a man awoke in his home near the Turkish city of Izmit. Feeling thirsty and unable to sleep he roused his wife and they took coffee on the balcony. Suddenly a loud and growing rumbling shattered the stillness of the early hours. The building shook and swayed and the couple had to grasp the parapet to avoid being hurled to their deaths. As the terrible cacophony reached a climax, the ground beneath rose and fell in waves and the whole building began to fall forward. Thinking their end had come the couple prayed for deliverance. Their prayers were answered. The front of the balcony softly touched the ground and the tilting ceased, allowing the pair to step off and run to safety. The second they had left, the building suddenly came alive again, tilting backwards this time until it stood straight and proud once more. Then it collapsed like a pack of cards, killing instantly or incarcerating the dozens of less favoured families left inside. An extraordinary scene, but just one of many played out on the night of August 17 1999, when a terrible earthquake, registering 7.4 on the Richter Scale, struck north west Turkey a hundred miles east of Istanbul. Within seconds, tens of thousands of buildings were reduced to rubble or severely damaged, killing almost 20,000 people and injuring countless others. It was the 11th most lethal quake of the 20th century. Economically too it took an enormous toll. Some estimates put the cost at more than 10% of Turkey's GDP. The quake should have come as no surprise. The region around Izmit straddles the 1,600km long North Anatolian Fault, a weakness in the crust that mark's the boundary between two of the earth's plates. Time and time again over the last hundred years this fault has ruptured, generating eight destructive earthquakes - in excess of magnitude seven on the Richter Scale - that have crept ominously closer and closer towards the great urban sprawl of Istanbul. Following the Izmit quake, and another almost as large that shook the Ducze region three months later, all the active segments of the North Anatolian Fault have now ruptured, except that beneath the Sea of Marmara - directly south of Istanbul. Given this picture it is not surprising that the Turkish authorities and the population of Istanbul are seriously worried about the safety of this great city. Istanbul has been rocked before by major earthquakes - the last in 1766. Then, as now, the event was preceded by a sequence of quakes that worked their way along the North Anatolian Fault from the east, and another occurred in the Izmit region just decades before the last Istanbul quake. Geologists point out that a 160km stretch of the North Anatolian Fault beneath the Sea of Marmara has been accumulating stress since 1766. This is sufficient to trigger a displacement along the fault of five and a half metres - easily enough to generate an earthquake at least as big as that which flattened Izmit last year. It seems inevitable then that Istanbul will succumb to a major earthquake, possibly sometime in the next few decades. But how will it and its people fare? The omens from the Izmit quake are not good. Because of the continuous seismic threat, building codes are in force to ensure that structures are capable of surviving the magnitude 7 plus quakes that regularly rock the north of the country. Unfortunately the Izmit experience showed that having the codes in place is simply not sufficient to avoid catastrophe. They must also be enforced. At Izmit and in the surrounding urban centres, thousands of apartment blocks that should have stood relatively firm were reduced to rubble with ease, burying all inside and yielding few survivors. It was not long before the reasons for this became apparent. The building boom of the last few decades - driven by the rapid growth of the Turkish economy - had led to a proliferation of cowboy builders and methods. Cheap or inappropriate materials were used, walls and floors were not sufficiently tied together, and housing inspectors turned a blind eye - perhaps aided by a little greasing of palms - to what would turn out to be the lethal cutting of costs and corners. In the aftermath of the catastrophe it was not too difficult to spot the irresponsible builders as little evidence of their labours remained. But among the heaps of rubble and bodies, some apartment blocks stood virtually untouched - testimony to the work of builders who gave more than a passing nod in the direction of the Turkish earthquake building codes. Since the Izmit disaster, politicians in Turkey have been desperate to demonstrate to their people, and particularly the 12 million who live in greater Istanbul, that they regard the enforcement of seismic building regulations as of paramount importance. One former Istanbul mayoral candidate - also an architect - whom I talked to during a recent visit was not, however, optimistic - pointing out that of the two and a half million buildings making up Istanbul around 80% are illegally or inappropriately constructed. Even if more stringent seismic code enforcement does result in new buildings being sufficiently earthquake-proofed, there does not seem to be either the political will or the money to ensure the expensive retrofitting needed to make these huge numbers of older buildings safe during the coming quake. As earthquake engineers never tire of pointing out \"it is buildings not earthquakes that kill people\" so the future for inhabitants of the \"gateway to Asia\" looks far from rosy. \u0095 The Izmit earthquake and the threat to Istanbul are addressed in the second programme of Bill McGuire's new Radio 4 series Disasters In Waiting at 9pm on Wednesday, April 26.

In global biomass, the only other species that even approaches humankind is the Antarctic krill. </p> <p>Krill don't kill, but humans are now exterminating other species at between 100 and 200 times the normal rate of extinction. </p> <p>This is a book to be grabbed eagerly by the confused, who need help through the whole messy business of life: its prodigality, its fragility. This is the book to guide you through the mysteries of phyla: there are only 15 species of sphenophyta or horsetails, but there are 10,000 species of bryophyta or mosses. </p> <p>There are 750 kinds of tardigrada or water bears, but they seem to be practically indestructible, and 52,000 species of craniata, which include all the bony fishes, all amphibians, birds, reptiles, grizzly bears and humans. </p> <p>The list of recent vertebrate extinctions fills eight pages of small print in this book. There are 500 genetically distinct banana cultivars and, by the way, the banana is an aggressive weed. </p> <p>Cabbage, broccoli, kohlrabi and calabrese are all one species, Brassica oleracea. The Kayapo Indians exploit 45 species of trees (how many people could even name 45 species of tree?) and sow 86 varieties of food plants. </p> <p>Chagga gardeners in Kenya cultivate 100 species. In 21 home gardens of the Santa Rosa people in Peru, naturalists counted 168 different species. Meanwhile 150 nations cultivate the potato for food, as well as industrial quantities of starch, alcohol, glucose and dextrin. Andean farmers recognise 3,000-5,000 different varieties. </p> <p>Anchovies are by far the most fished-for fish, the annual catch far outweighing the Atlantic cod, herring and skipjack tuna together. </p> <p>You get the picture: even the things you thought you knew, you didn't. Is life possible with diminishing global biodiversity? We are in the process of finding that out. Could you live without this book? Yes, but such books offer something to live by, as well as with. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Global Biodiversity: Earth's Living Resources in the 21st Century (World Conservation Monitoring Centre \u00a329.99) One species, Mark Collins points out in the foreword, has appropriated 40% of the world's productivity; about a dozen crops provide 75% of its food. In global biomass, the only other species that even approaches humankind is the Antarctic krill. Krill don't kill, but humans are now exterminating other species at between 100 and 200 times the normal rate of extinction. This is a book to be grabbed eagerly by the confused, who need help through the whole messy business of life: its prodigality, its fragility. This is the book to guide you through the mysteries of phyla: there are only 15 species of sphenophyta or horsetails, but there are 10,000 species of bryophyta or mosses. There are 750 kinds of tardigrada or water bears, but they seem to be practically indestructible, and 52,000 species of craniata, which include all the bony fishes, all amphibians, birds, reptiles, grizzly bears and humans. The list of recent vertebrate extinctions fills eight pages of small print in this book. There are 500 genetically distinct banana cultivars and, by the way, the banana is an aggressive weed. Cabbage, broccoli, kohlrabi and calabrese are all one species, Brassica oleracea. The Kayapo Indians exploit 45 species of trees (how many people could even name 45 species of tree?) and sow 86 varieties of food plants. Chagga gardeners in Kenya cultivate 100 species. In 21 home gardens of the Santa Rosa people in Peru, naturalists counted 168 different species. Meanwhile 150 nations cultivate the potato for food, as well as industrial quantities of starch, alcohol, glucose and dextrin. Andean farmers recognise 3,000-5,000 different varieties. Anchovies are by far the most fished-for fish, the annual catch far outweighing the Atlantic cod, herring and skipjack tuna together. You get the picture: even the things you thought you knew, you didn't. Is life possible with diminishing global biodiversity? We are in the process of finding that out. Could you live without this book? Yes, but such books offer something to live by, as well as with.",

The network of parties also kept her spirits up in the early days. Asking volunteers to compile directories is not new. The success of sites like Epinions and the Open Directory Project proves that users are prepared to submit valuable opinions for free. If Traveldonkey succeeds, it could offer an example of how quickly a good website idea can still sell itself, however na\u00efve its creators seem at its inception. And in a month when accusations of the gentrification of the web increased, the success of a site like traveldonkey could help counter the perception that only the well connected, and the well-heeled can now make a mint in cyberspace.",

As far as I can see Netscape opened up the code for it but never consolidated it all and skipped straight to version 6. Is this to make sure they remain one (version) step ahead of Microsoft, in which case they are being rather childish? Or are they ignoring a flawed policy with version 5, in which case they should admit it and stop being so silly! I want answers! :-) George Forth forth@dircon.co.uk \u0095 Online replies: Netscape 5 did go missing, presumed by many to be lost to programming difficulties.

Telefonica of Spain pulled out on Monday, joining another half dozen firms who have found the going too expensive. </p> <p>The prize? The right to run one of a new generation of high-speed mobile networks which will - the telcos claim - bring the internet and multimedia to subscribers at blisteringly high speeds, while they are on the move. The new services could be available some time in 2002. </p> <p>Yet it could all end in tears for those who win a licence. The massive amounts they are going to pay the exchequer may mean 3G handsets and services will be too expensive for ordinary consumers. Also, cheaper technologies which do not require completely new networks, or expensive 3G licences, could give the new networks a run for their money. </p> <p>The spectacular failure of the Iridium satellite telephone network - whose startup costs of around $7bn were still lower than those faced by some of the successful 3G bidders - shows that expensive handsets and high call charges put off most consumers. Iridium won only around 50,000 customers worldwide before it collapsed last month, with debts of $5bn. </p> <p>Like Iridium, 3G could be undermined by the strength of competing technologies. GPRS (general packet radio service), due to arrive in Britain later this year, will bring more power to mobile devices, but without many of the huge startup costs faced by 3G. </p> <p>Eventually, GPRS could become powerful enough to offer some of the services available on 3G through technology called Edge (Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evaluation). </p> <p>Edge has been developed specifically as an alternative for telecoms companies who lose out in 3G auctions, and it could deliver 400Kbps to mobile handsets. Twin ISDN lines to desktop PCs currently offer only 128Kbps; the best telephone line modems offer a maximum of 56Kbps. This would be enough to offer video and high-quality audio, despite being only around half as fast as 3G. </p> <p>Sam Forster, technology head in Cap Gemini UK's strategic technology unit, says this technology could undermine the business case for 3G. \"You could be looking at, potentially, up to half a meg of bandwidth without having a 3G licence. That makes an interesting financial model if you think that kind of bandwidth is good enough for your organisation.\" </p> <p>At the heart of what its fans say will be the 3G revolution will be new handsets and a new way of using your phone. You won't just talk to it any more, you'll be able to watch TV, listen to music, shop, book a restaurant table and surf the net. And, since it will always be connected to the network, you'll always receive important information \"pushed\" down the airwaves at you. </p> <p>That is the hype. Some may say we have been down this road before - only recently, with Wap (wireless application protocol), which has been disappointingly buggy and slow. 3G also faces a number of challenges, not least the huge amounts paid out for the licences to run the networks. It is important to remember the vast sums promised in the bandwidth auction come before the expected \u00a33bn apiece cost of building the infrastructure for each network. And Forster points out that \"mobile operators are still dreaming up the business models\" as auction prices soar. </p> <p>\"The mobile operators are so desperate to get a licence for this bandwidth that these vast sums are being spent. The figures the networks are talking are around \u00a33,000 a customer, just to pay for the licence, and then anything between \u00a31,000 and \u00a33,000 for the infrastructure. </p> <p>\"It's a significant investment by these organisations. It's obviously great news for the taxpayer, but not such great news for the future mobile subscribers,\" says Forster. He adds that successful bidders will attempt to recoup some of their costs by reselling parts of the bandwidth. </p> <p>\"They will also introduce new ways of paying for content and services used by mobile subscribers,\" he says. \"They could charge per packet [of data], they could charge per event, they could charge by the amount of data or even what kind of data it is. The 3G charging models will be pretty much based around the existing internet ones, plus the existing cable ones with things like video on demand.\" </p> <p> The mobile phone industry is confident that the technology will, at least, be able to deliver. Mike Short, director of international affairs at BT Cellnet , says 3G will \"allow for a much greater mobile information society, where information overload can be avoided\". </p> <p>He adds: \"By the time 3G is in, we'll be beyond just short messaging into short postcards. We'll also be into longer messages as well, where email to the mobile phone is much more common. That doesn't mean huge PowerPoint messages to the phone - it may mean only relevant personalised messages. So, for example, have your email headers delivered to you. You might have your emails screened so that only those relevant by location are sent, or you might let through the ones from the managing director - or your wife.\" </p> <p>Janiece Webb, senior vice president of Motorola's personal networking group, says the G3 mobiles will deliver \"convergence\" - where the worlds of computing, internet, communications and entertainment merge and complement each other. \"By the end of 2003 there will be well over a billion wireless internet users - more than there are internet users today,\" she says. </p> <p>Motorola is forming alliances with companies like Oracle and IBM to bring powerful database-driven business applications to mobile phone users. \"Those in the database environment want to be able to extend their reach and let customers take whatever they want to do wirelessly,\" says Webb. </p> <p>\"The single thing in short supply in today's environment is time. People's work lives and home lives are blurring. Productivity comes from being able to do whatever I want to do wherever I'm at - I don't have to do it hooked to a PC in the office. I should be able to read my emails or get critical information regardless of where I am.\" </p> <p>This may sound like 3G will be a business tool, rather than one for the masses. Webb admits that businesses will probably be the first users, but says the large amount of bandwidth on offer should make mobile online entertainment compelling. Young people, already voracious consumers of mobile technology, will quickly take to 3G, she says. </p> <p>But will ordinary consumers be able to afford 3G? Forster points out that the recent explosion in mobile phone use has been fuelled by cheap handsets and pre-pay phones with no expensive long-term contracts. \"Early takeup is encouraged by low start-up costs: you get free connection, or free air time, or a free handset,\" he says. \"But you look at the cost model per customer that they have [for 3G] and you find it is potentially \u00a36,000 a customer. It's going to be painful to give that away for nothing.\" </p> <p>The conundrum is that, without the inducement, 3G networks may struggle. </p>",

That makes an interesting financial model if you think that kind of bandwidth is good enough for your organisation.\" At the heart of what its fans say will be the 3G revolution will be new handsets and a new way of using your phone. You won't just talk to it any more, you'll be able to watch TV, listen to music, shop, book a restaurant table and surf the net. And, since it will always be connected to the network, you'll always receive important information \"pushed\" down the airwaves at you. That is the hype. Some may say we have been down this road before - only recently, with Wap (wireless application protocol), which has been disappointingly buggy and slow. 3G also faces a number of challenges, not least the huge amounts paid out for the licences to run the networks. It is important to remember the vast sums promised in the bandwidth auction come before the expected \u00a33bn apiece cost of building the infrastructure for each network. And Forster points out that \"mobile operators are still dreaming up the business models\" as auction prices soar. \"The mobile operators are so desperate to get a licence for this bandwidth that these vast sums are being spent. The figures the networks are talking are around \u00a33,000 a customer, just to pay for the licence, and then anything between \u00a31,000 and \u00a33,000 for the infrastructure. \"It's a significant investment by these organisations. It's obviously great news for the taxpayer, but not such great news for the future mobile subscribers,\" says Forster. He adds that successful bidders will attempt to recoup some of their costs by reselling parts of the bandwidth. \"They will also introduce new ways of paying for content and services used by mobile subscribers,\" he says. \"They could charge per packet [of data], they could charge per event, they could charge by the amount of data or even what kind of data it is. The 3G charging models will be pretty much based around the existing internet ones, plus the existing cable ones with things like video on demand.\" The mobile phone industry is confident that the technology will, at least, be able to deliver. Mike Short, director of international affairs at BT Cellnet , says 3G will \"allow for a much greater mobile information society, where information overload can be avoided\". He adds: \"By the time 3G is in, we'll be beyond just short messaging into short postcards. We'll also be into longer messages as well, where email to the mobile phone is much more common. That doesn't mean huge PowerPoint messages to the phone - it may mean only relevant personalised messages. So, for example, have your email headers delivered to you. You might have your emails screened so that only those relevant by location are sent, or you might let through the ones from the managing director - or your wife.\" Janiece Webb, senior vice president of Motorola's personal networking group, says the G3 mobiles will deliver \"convergence\" - where the worlds of computing, internet, communications and entertainment merge and complement each other. \"By the end of 2003 there will be well over a billion wireless internet users - more than there are internet users today,\" she says. Motorola is forming alliances with companies like Oracle and IBM to bring powerful database-driven business applications to mobile phone users. \"Those in the database environment want to be able to extend their reach and let customers take whatever they want to do wirelessly,\" says Webb. \"The single thing in short supply in today's environment is time. People's work lives and home lives are blurring. Productivity comes from being able to do whatever I want to do wherever I'm at - I don't have to do it hooked to a PC in the office. I should be able to read my emails or get critical information regardless of where I am.\" This may sound like 3G will be a business tool, rather than one for the masses. Webb admits that businesses will probably be the first users, but says the large amount of bandwidth on offer should make mobile online entertainment compelling. Young people, already voracious consumers of mobile technology, will quickly take to 3G, she says. But will ordinary consumers be able to afford 3G? Forster points out that the recent explosion in mobile phone use has been fuelled by cheap handsets and pre-pay phones with no expensive long-term contracts. \"Early takeup is encouraged by low start-up costs: you get free connection, or free air time, or a free handset,\" he says. \"But you look at the cost model per customer that they have [for 3G] and you find it is potentially \u00a36,000 a customer. It's going to be painful to give that away for nothing.\" The conundrum is that, without the inducement, 3G networks may struggle.",

These can last from three weeks to an academic year, so it is wise for students to be realistic about their needs. It is generally accepted that approximately 200 hours of study are needed to improve by one IELTS band-score.</p> <p>Once embarked on a degree course, Martin Kenworthy, director of the Language Services Unit at the University of Leicester, also stresses the value of good quality in-sessional training, preferably linked to subject areas. \"We go into the departments and work with students in their lectures. We also encourage departments to give formative assignments early in the course to avoid disaster for a student later, when assignments count.\" </p> <p>Some of the \"new\" universities -those formed from polytechnics in 1992 - are experimenting with new styles of pre-sessional and foundation courses. Elspeth Jones, director of the Centre for Language Study at Leeds Metropolitan University, explains: \"Our courses are monthly, and so students from parts of the world with a different academic year can enrol at any time. The General English courses can also become credit-bearing modules in the Credit Accumulation and Transfer Scheme (CATS) and therefore part of a student's degree.\"</p> <p>She feels that language training in new universities is generally more flexible than in older institutions. \"Universities like ours can take students with lower IELTS grades and can put them through a programme that will bring them up to the required standard - though we cannot guarantee how long it will take.\"</p> <p>Faced with the variety of courses on offer, Andrew Waite, Vice-Chair of the British Association of State English Language Teaching (BASELT) urges caution. \"One problem is that some institutions clearly need to further improve their support for international students. Students need to do research and find out about language centres. Have they been externally assessed under the English in Britain accreditation system, is one question to ask.\"</p> <p>BALEAP runs a self-regulatory accreditation system which, like English in Britain, ensures courses meet high standards, not just in teaching, but in all areas including management, welfare, course design, staffing and assessment.</p> <p>However, if language tutors are right to issue warnings about some current provision, what will be the effect of Education UK? Ros Richards, head of English for Academic Purposes at the University of Reading, feels the remedy lies in careful planning. \"Increased provision for pre-sessional and in-sessional English language programmes will be needed. In their academic departments greater numbers of international students are likely to need more supporting material for their courses, and more explicit feedback on content and language. This will require more time from academic staff. Institutions need to be addressing this issue now and planning its effective resourcing for the future.\"</p> <p><strong>For more information</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.englishinbritain.co.uk\">English in Britain</a>, information is available from local British Council offices</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.baselt.org.uk\">BASELT</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.baleap.org.uk\">BALEAP</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ielts.org\">IELTS</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.toefl.org\">TOEFL</a></p>",

Once embarked on a degree course, Martin Kenworthy, director of the Language Services Unit at the University of Leicester, also stresses the value of good quality in-sessional training, preferably linked to subject areas. \"We go into the departments and work with students in their lectures. We also encourage departments to give formative assignments early in the course to avoid disaster for a student later, when assignments count.\" Some of the \"new\" universities -those formed from polytechnics in 1992 - are experimenting with new styles of pre-sessional and foundation courses. Elspeth Jones, director of the Centre for Language Study at Leeds Metropolitan University, explains: \"Our courses are monthly, and so students from parts of the world with a different academic year can enrol at any time. The General English courses can also become credit-bearing modules in the Credit Accumulation and Transfer Scheme (CATS) and therefore part of a student's degree.\" She feels that language training in new universities is generally more flexible than in older institutions. \"Universities like ours can take students with lower IELTS grades and can put them through a programme that will bring them up to the required standard - though we cannot guarantee how long it will take.\" Faced with the variety of courses on offer, Andrew Waite, Vice-Chair of the British Association of State English Language Teaching (BASELT) urges caution. \"One problem is that some institutions clearly need to further improve their support for international students. Students need to do research and find out about language centres. Have they been externally assessed under the English in Britain accreditation system, is one question to ask.\" BALEAP runs a self-regulatory accreditation system which, like English in Britain, ensures courses meet high standards, not just in teaching, but in all areas including management, welfare, course design, staffing and assessment. However, if language tutors are right to issue warnings about some current provision, what will be the effect of Education UK? Ros Richards, head of English for Academic Purposes at the University of Reading, feels the remedy lies in careful planning. \"Increased provision for pre-sessional and in-sessional English language programmes will be needed. In their academic departments greater numbers of international students are likely to need more supporting material for their courses, and more explicit feedback on content and language. This will require more time from academic staff. Institutions need to be addressing this issue now and planning its effective resourcing for the future.\" For more information English in Britain, information is available from local British Council offices BASELT BALEAP IELTS TOEFL",
