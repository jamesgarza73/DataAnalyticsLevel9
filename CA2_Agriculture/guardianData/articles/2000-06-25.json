      "body": "<p>If you want to get ahead, get together. That's the verdict of a growing number of office workers, who are recognising that they don't necessarily need to go on an external course to develop their skills and maximise their career. Building networks within the office - formal or informal - can be just as effective in providing a forum for self-development. </p> <p>Despite having rather negative connotations of over-ambitious social climbers, networking is the new buzzword among the support staff of many larger employers. A growing number of companies are actively encouraging support staff to take time out to utilise a variety of professional associations, ranging from the specialist (such as the British Society of Medical Secretaries) to the general such as PA Network). So impressed are some employers with the results that they are creating their own networks in-house. According to Hilton Catt and Patricia Scudamore, authors of The Power of Networking, in a further decade these internal secretarial networks will have changed the face of support work completely. </p> <p>\"Networking isn't just about the stereotype of social climbing. It's about getting contacts, becoming knowledgeable about the latest changes in the profession, raising the profile of your role, and ensuring you're getting the best chances of training and promotion - in other words reaching your full potential,\" explains Catt. \"Not surprisingly, employers have realised that creating their own formal networks means creating the very best secretaries around.\" </p> <p>So why now? According to Professor Alan Smithers, researcher in employment issues at the University of Liverpool, \"With layers of middle management disappearing and with the downsizing of companies, office support roles are no longer perceived as merely an 'extra wife' to a manager. Rather, they are recognised as roles which include overseeing information technology, training, marketing, personnel and managing small projects.\" </p> <p>Lisa Barnes, secretary co-ordinator at KPMG, thinks the large numbers of secretaries at work is a reason. \"In our Manchester office alone, we now have 57. So we decided to set up a system in which we meet up every six weeks to discuss issues affecting both the company and our jobs, and to learn from each other as to the best ways of dealing with them. It raises morale and has had a very positive effect on staff retention,\" she says. </p> <p>In addition, KPMG organises occasional meetings with client support staff to boost client relations and ensure that its employees keep up to date on the latest movements in the secretarial world. \"We also have 'Oceans of Opportunities' days, where all support functions set out stalls, almost like a bazaar,\" says David Chadwick, communications officer for the London office. \"It's invaluable for raising awareness of what the different departments do - thereby creating better links - and also offers otherwise hidden opportunities for changing careers, essential in a climate where secretaries are increasingly moving into roles such as HR and marketing.\" </p> <p>Dr Jane Sturges, research fellow at Birkbeck college in London, has found that with fewer management levels and often less money available, traditional incentives such as bonuses and extra annual leave are being replaced by increased responsibility and opportunities for building on skills. \"Networking is seen as a kind of perk for secretaries,\" she explains. \"They know their job won't be for life anymore so they want more transferable rewards.\" </p> <p>At the forefront of the trend for internal secretarial networks is pharmaceutical giant Glaxo Wellcome, whose network is entitled, rather grandly, \"Creating the Secretary of the Future\" (CSF). \"A group of secretaries - of which there are 450 within the company - got together two years ago to discuss growing discontent,\" explains Denise Healy, who has given up her job as a PA to become the network's co-ordinator. \"We realised it was due to changes in technology and in our role, changes that we didn't feel we could keep up with unless we all pulled together. We designed a detailed questionnaire asking for the particular solutions secretaries had in mind and asked volunteers to canvass opinions in their area. That led to the decision to create a forum with five projects: a measure of competencies that secretaries could work towards and continually improve on; self-development which allows them to be more pro-active in gaining skills they need; a website with continually updated news; a communications network; and secretarial seminars.\" </p> <p>Lesa Cheshire, a secretary at Glaxo Wellcome, claims the network has changed her working life. \"Two years ago, we were just getting on with our jobs and could have been working anywhere. But now, people care about us - what we're doing and how we're doing it. Because the network gets a huge amount of support and sponsorship from board level, and projects such as the competency measures have been developed to directly relate to our appraisals, all our managers are deeply involved too.\" </p> <p>Backing from the top is one of the reasons that Chris Towler, director of global regulatory policy, intelligence and education, believes the programme is so successful. \"If anyone is going to be belittled in an organisation, it's the support staff. So it's very easy for their network to be seen as little more than a workplace women's gossip group unless it has the name of the MD associated with it. In any case, network objectives need to work alongside company objectives.\" </p> <p>The other reason the network works, adds Healy, is because it's run by and for the secretaries. \"We want support from the big guys, but we don't want them to run the show.\" </p> <p>CSF held its first seminar earlier this month. \"We've had odd lectures before but this is the first time we have run a whole day devoted to speakers, workshops and stands,\" says one secretary, browsing the latest training opportunities in IT before rushing off to the medical terminology accreditation stall. \"I worked here for six years before I knew a thing about a single one of our pharmaceutical products,\" she confesses. \"But now CSF has regular talks about them and I've become really interested in our latest inventions and am considering training in a more specialised medical area of the business.\" </p> <p>\"Are you going to the 'Dealing with Difficult People' workshop of the 'Self-Motivation to Succeed' seminar?\" a PA interrupts. It is packed. \"Let's start with the difficulties,\" the presenter says, to which the secretaries shout in unison, \"The know-alls?\" \"What about the ones who start every sentence with, 'I don't mean to be negative but . . .'\" says one PA. \"And the ones who never say thank you?\" pipes up another. Creating the list seems to be therapeutic in itself. \"The day inspired me in many ways,\" says secretary Jacqui Williams. \"But above all, it was nice to have an opportunity to really get to know the people I work with.\" </p> <p>And this is the hidden benefit that employers are recognising, that beyond all the management gabble there is a great deal of benefit if staff simply know and get on with each other. Pharmaceuticals giant Unilever even tries to recruit compatible people with the express intention that they will have a good chance of getting along. \"Employees report that working in a sociable networked environment stimulates creativity because it fosters teamwork, information-sharing and a spirit of openness to new ideas,\" says a spokesperson. \"But they also report that nothing else comes close when it comes to making their work enjoyable.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>Talks which could have led to Britain's biggest internet service provider, Freeserve, being bought by German rival T-Online have broken down, it emerged at the weekend. </p> <p>Freeserve is expected to issue a joint statement today with parent company Dixons, which owns 80% of the group, confirming that discussions have terminated. </p> <p>Insiders said alternative conversations with cable company NTL were still going on but were unlikely to reach any conclusion in the near future. </p> <p>The announcement will leave Freeserve management facing awkward questions when the company announces its full-year results tomorrow, when it had been expected to present a deal. It is also likely to have a damaging effect on Freeserve shares on a day when the entire net sector is braced for another battering. </p> <p>The deal would have seen Dixons taking cash and shares in the combined net group. </p> <p>Insiders said the cessation of talks had been amicable but centered on \"cultural differences\" between the two firms. The German business had also been concerned that Freeserve management might quit once the deal was done and their share options cashed. </p> <p>\"The two sides obviously had very long talks and remain on good terms,\" said one source close to the negotiations. </p> <p>\"For T-Online, matters were complicated by the fact that this was very soon after their flotation and they were already under enormous pressure. It was too much to achieve in too short a time.\" </p> <p>The statement from Dixons will be the first public words on the fate of Freeserve since the admission in May that it was reviewing its options for the future of the net group. Freeserve is at present valued at around \u00a34.5bn, although reports suggest the business could be sold for up to \u00a36bn. </p> <p>An acquisition of Freeserve by NTL would accelerate the cable firm's attempt to make itself the leader in Britain for telephony, pay-television and broadband internet access. </p> <p>The company - which is 25% owned by France Telecom and in which Microsoft has a minor stake - has proven an agressive competitor to companies such as BT and BSkyB. </p> <p>Question marks, however, hang over the level of debt already weighing on NTL, and some observers suggest that its plans actually stop short of a full takeover.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Talks which could have led to Britain's biggest internet service provider, Freeserve, being bought by German rival T-Online have broken down, it emerged at the weekend. Freeserve is expected to issue a joint statement today with parent company Dixons, which owns 80% of the group, confirming that discussions have terminated. Insiders said alternative conversations with cable company NTL were still going on but were unlikely to reach any conclusion in the near future. The announcement will leave Freeserve management facing awkward questions when the company announces its full-year results tomorrow, when it had been expected to present a deal. It is also likely to have a damaging effect on Freeserve shares on a day when the entire net sector is braced for another battering. The deal would have seen Dixons taking cash and shares in the combined net group. Insiders said the cessation of talks had been amicable but centered on \"cultural differences\" between the two firms. The German business had also been concerned that Freeserve management might quit once the deal was done and their share options cashed. \"The two sides obviously had very long talks and remain on good terms,\" said one source close to the negotiations. \"For T-Online, matters were complicated by the fact that this was very soon after their flotation and they were already under enormous pressure. It was too much to achieve in too short a time.\" The statement from Dixons will be the first public words on the fate of Freeserve since the admission in May that it was reviewing its options for the future of the net group. Freeserve is at present valued at around \u00a34.5bn, although reports suggest the business could be sold for up to \u00a36bn. An acquisition of Freeserve by NTL would accelerate the cable firm's attempt to make itself the leader in Britain for telephony, pay-television and broadband internet access. The company - which is 25% owned by France Telecom and in which Microsoft has a minor stake - has proven an agressive competitor to companies such as BT and BSkyB. Question marks, however, hang over the level of debt already weighing on NTL, and some observers suggest that its plans actually stop short of a full takeover.",

      "body": "<p>After England's exit from Euro2000, the onset of Wimbledon gives Brits another chance to hone their skills in the one field we excel at - being a good loser.</p> <p>Coming last in sport is not quite as exquisitely painful an experience as losing out in your job, though. If your team fails to score there is always a fountain to urinate in. Peeing in the office water dispenser is hardly the approved way of letting off frustration when you fail to land that pay-rise at work. And giving the gang from IT a good kicking will probably lead to the sack, if not a custodial sentence. </p> <p>So how to handle the gut-wrenching moment when you fail to deliver in the win-win stakes? How to turn \"lose\" into a spin success? Perhaps we can take some tips from the more celebrity losers, after all. Try, for instance:</p> <p><strong>The Oscar loser's delight</strong></p> <p>For facial expression techniques when that key job goes to someone else or the sales pitch turns pear-shaped look no further than Oscars night. They expect to win, they would kill to win. And yet when the camera zooms into close-up as another name is announced, they punch the air and gurgle with delight as though their preferred choice had been selected. </p> <p><strong>Key tips</strong><br>Rehearse the smile for weeks before to avoid the faux-rictus look. Be the first to rush up and congratulate the colleague who did get the job/sale. Don't let anyone hear you retching in the toilet afterwards</p> <p><strong>The footballer's gape</strong></p> <p>In the world of football the stiff upper lip is dead. As in industry, commitment is all on the pitch, and the steely grin of indifference is taken as a sign of weakness. When you lose out in the style of any British goalie, the technique is to stare in disbelief. 'Whaaaaaat?' should be your war-cry before you scour the vicinity for someone else to blame. Claim dirty tricks on behalf of the person who did get the job/sale you wanted and go off with your suit jacket or shirt pulled up over your head, kicking over waste bins en route. Tears or a defiant finger are also recommended.</p> <p><strong>Key tips</strong><br>It can help to apologise for the tantrum later, just to prove you are a reliable employee and not just a spoilt five-year-old brat. Explain that the winning meant a lot to you and that you will up your performance next time. (Or get Kevin Keegan to do the apologies for you)</p> <p><strong>The architect's waffle</strong></p> <p>When Sir Norman Foster explained patiently to the press that the Millennium Bridge was far from being a failure and that, anyway, it wasn't his fault, he did us all a service in terms of technique.</p> <p>When confronted by a \"lose\" at work make a few ethereal quotes about how success and fail can never be measured in layman's terms. Then say that you only learn through the faults that show up. And that it was your colleague's responsibility in the first place. </p> <p><strong>Key tips</strong><br>A look of confidence is vital for this type of performance.

      "bodyText": "After England's exit from Euro2000, the onset of Wimbledon gives Brits another chance to hone their skills in the one field we excel at - being a good loser. Coming last in sport is not quite as exquisitely painful an experience as losing out in your job, though. If your team fails to score there is always a fountain to urinate in. Peeing in the office water dispenser is hardly the approved way of letting off frustration when you fail to land that pay-rise at work. And giving the gang from IT a good kicking will probably lead to the sack, if not a custodial sentence. So how to handle the gut-wrenching moment when you fail to deliver in the win-win stakes? How to turn \"lose\" into a spin success? Perhaps we can take some tips from the more celebrity losers, after all. Try, for instance: The Oscar loser's delight For facial expression techniques when that key job goes to someone else or the sales pitch turns pear-shaped look no further than Oscars night. They expect to win, they would kill to win. And yet when the camera zooms into close-up as another name is announced, they punch the air and gurgle with delight as though their preferred choice had been selected. Key tips Rehearse the smile for weeks before to avoid the faux-rictus look. Be the first to rush up and congratulate the colleague who did get the job/sale. Don't let anyone hear you retching in the toilet afterwards The footballer's gape In the world of football the stiff upper lip is dead. As in industry, commitment is all on the pitch, and the steely grin of indifference is taken as a sign of weakness. When you lose out in the style of any British goalie, the technique is to stare in disbelief. 'Whaaaaaat?' should be your war-cry before you scour the vicinity for someone else to blame. Claim dirty tricks on behalf of the person who did get the job/sale you wanted and go off with your suit jacket or shirt pulled up over your head, kicking over waste bins en route. Tears or a defiant finger are also recommended. Key tips It can help to apologise for the tantrum later, just to prove you are a reliable employee and not just a spoilt five-year-old brat. Explain that the winning meant a lot to you and that you will up your performance next time. (Or get Kevin Keegan to do the apologies for you) The architect's waffle When Sir Norman Foster explained patiently to the press that the Millennium Bridge was far from being a failure and that, anyway, it wasn't his fault, he did us all a service in terms of technique. When confronted by a \"lose\" at work make a few ethereal quotes about how success and fail can never be measured in layman's terms. Then say that you only learn through the faults that show up. And that it was your colleague's responsibility in the first place. Key tips A look of confidence is vital for this type of performance. Stick one hand in a pocket and smile as though moving through life without a care in the world. Imply you are on a higher plane of thinking than mere mortals and that - even if you did make excuses - they wouldn't understand them, anyway. The political vanishing act Politicians and their entourages have acquired a new technique when the whiff of 'lose' is in the air: they vanish from sight for a week or so. 'Going underground' is a valuable technique because it relieves you of the prospect of too much stage-managed indifference. You may only be able to check out of the workplace for the odd day's paid holiday, but you can achieve the same effect by keeping a low profile for a month or so. This means that, by the time you join in the swing of things again, the rest of the office have forgotten your shame and embarrassment. Low-profiles are easy to maintain in the modern workplace. Lower your chair a little to make yourself hidden behind you PC screen, arrive early and leave a little later each day, and stop attending unnecessary meetings.

      "body": "<p>They reinstated him as swiftly as they decently could. At the beginning of July, Graham Thorpe will be back in the England set-up, from which he chose to excuse himself by withdrawing his availability for the South African tour last August, as a member of the one-day squad. They may like to have him in the side for Thursday's second Test as well, but I doubt whether the selectors can justify that. Thorpe himself would be surprised to find himself among the names chosen for the Lord's Test, which are announced this morning. </p> <p>Thorpe has always been the strongest advocate of the central contract system; now in the short term he may be a victim of it. The selectors are surely duty-bound to give one more chance to their chosen men, however fragile they may look. Even if their instincts are beginning to waver, they have to persist with Mark Ramprakash and Graeme Hick a little longer. Thorpe could replace Nick Knight (non-contracted) but this would be harsh on the man who top-scored in both English innings at Edgbaston (albeit with 26 and 34). And there's always Michael Vaughan (contracted) to consider. Even so, it's a question of when rather than if Thorpe returns to the Test scene. I'll be surprised if he's not there at Old Trafford for the third Test. </p> <p>Thorpe won't and can't complain about his absence so far this summer. 'There's no bitterness about that. Maybe if I had blazed a few hundreds at the start of the season I would have been there for the first Test.' But he didn't. He started the season slowly, a victim of moist and mischievous pitches and his own rustiness after the first winter lay-off that he had experienced in 10 years, which have been consumed by three A tours and seven senior tours. 'But,' he adds, 'there are no regrets either.' </p> <p>'I could see the consequences of pulling out of the winter tour. I knew the central contracts were coming up. I knew that by pulling out I might not play for England again. But I had to weigh up my priorities, balancing the needs of my family [he now has two children aged one and three] and my career. As the season progressed I had to ask myself, \"Am I looking forward to the day we step onto the plane for South Africa. Am I looking forward to the tour and the cricket?\".' </p> <p>In all honesty he could not give an unequivocal 'Yes' to those questions. So he decided to take a rest and withdrew. He was in good company. Graham Gooch, who turned down an Ashes tour, Ian Botham, Geoff Boycott and Ray Illingworth have all taken winters out. None the less, some viewed his withdrawal as an act of treachery. He would have been criticised more heavily if he had grumped his way around South Africa, pining for home for three-and-a-half months. </p> <p>'The hardest part was telling Nasser,' he says. 'We've been mates for years and we've been through a lot together, good times and bad [remember that match-winning 288-run partnership against the Aussies at Birmingham in 1997; there's no time and space to chronicle the lows just now]. Nasser did not try to dissuade me. He knows me well enough to realise that it would have been a waste of time.' </p> <p>Clearly his best mates regard him as 'obstinate'. David Lloyd famously labelled him 'surly' in his book, although quickly left an apologetic message on the Thorpe answerphone once the 'surly' headlines appeared. But Thorpe says he likes touring. 'I may not be the most outgoing of men, but I enjoy the company of my team-mates, enjoy new places.' </p> <p>Yet he can be difficult - or single-minded depending on your standpoint. Before the World Cup he didn't turn up to an official dinner at Canterbury and was fined. He just about acknowledges that his absence that night was a mistake. By the way, this is done with a smile.There's no sign of surliness at all. Passing team-mates suggest with a wink that he must be launching a charm offensive. Actually, Thorpe, quiet-spoken and private though he may be, is no grumpier than any other English cricketer and he may well have a healthier sense of perspective than most of them. </p> <p>He has been one of the more reassuring sights - amid modest competition - coming out to bat in a crisis for England. He's not guaranteed to score runs, but he always seems to give himself a decent chance of doing so. Thorpe thinks more in terms of opportunities, than burdens. He showed that in his first Test when he scored a century against the Australians in 1993 and at Exmouth, where I met him, he recognised these same qualities in two youngsters who had just been batting for Devon against Surrey in the NatWest. David Lye and Matt Wood, 40 years between them, had just added 100 together. 'They didn't worry about failing. I think that's how I felt in my first Test. I hope I'll have the same positive approach if I play Test cricket again.' </p> <p>So Thorpe is less likely to be shackled by the pressures of Test cricket. Whenever possible, he likes to take the initiative, to take the attack to the bowlers. He's noticed how Steve Waugh often does the same; racing to 20 by taking the gamble of hitting a few early boundaries and then consolidating. Curiously, he plays a more restricted role in one-day cricket for Surrey and for England, when he resumes his one-day career. He is seen as a 'finisher', the man who stays in, picks up ones and twos, who spurns too many big shots and whose duty is to be there at the end of a run chase. There may be times when he yearns to go for the extravagant boundary but says he gains equal satisfaction from seeing it through to the end. </p> <p>An in-form Thorpe is probably England's best middle-order batsman in Test cricket as well. Having seen the current lot mesmerised by Courtney Walsh and Curtly Ambrose, whom they now never expect to deliver a hittable ball, the selectors must pine for a refreshed and uncomplicated Thorpe to stiffen the middle order. But they don't want to be seen to panic either. So all the Edgbaston batsmen are likely to be retained for one more Test, to be given the chance to atone. Ed Giddins may not be so lucky though he was at his most potent when England last played at Lord's.</p>",

      "bodyText": "They reinstated him as swiftly as they decently could. At the beginning of July, Graham Thorpe will be back in the England set-up, from which he chose to excuse himself by withdrawing his availability for the South African tour last August, as a member of the one-day squad. They may like to have him in the side for Thursday's second Test as well, but I doubt whether the selectors can justify that. Thorpe himself would be surprised to find himself among the names chosen for the Lord's Test, which are announced this morning. Thorpe has always been the strongest advocate of the central contract system; now in the short term he may be a victim of it. The selectors are surely duty-bound to give one more chance to their chosen men, however fragile they may look. Even if their instincts are beginning to waver, they have to persist with Mark Ramprakash and Graeme Hick a little longer. Thorpe could replace Nick Knight (non-contracted) but this would be harsh on the man who top-scored in both English innings at Edgbaston (albeit with 26 and 34). And there's always Michael Vaughan (contracted) to consider. Even so, it's a question of when rather than if Thorpe returns to the Test scene. I'll be surprised if he's not there at Old Trafford for the third Test. Thorpe won't and can't complain about his absence so far this summer. 'There's no bitterness about that.

      "body": "<p>In its own right this was an important match since Worcestershire and Somerset are the top two teams in the first division of the National League. But there were intriguing games within the game as well. </p> <p>When Andrew Caddick was bowling to Graeme Hick on a typically bouncy Taunton surface the cricket was of the highest calibre - two quality performers testing one another out; the subsequent duel between Keith Parsons and David Leatherdale was perhaps less entrancing. And there was the chance to compare and contrast two of the brightest young cricketers in the coun try, Marcus Trescothick and Vikram Solanki. </p> <p>Or there would have been if Solanki had not edged the first ball of the match, delivered by Caddick, towards second slip, where Trescothick briefly juggled it before completing the catch. Round one to Trescothick, whom West Country folk believe to be extremely unlucky not to have made the one day squad for the forthcoming triangular series (he's the highest run-scorer in the National League this year), where he might have joined - or replaced - Solanki. </p> <p>Thereafter there were two games going on out there. When Hick was batting, all was serene, the pitch benign and runs flowed smoothly from his bat. When anyone else was on strike it all looked rather trickier. Hick scored 101 out of Worcestershire's total of 222-8 which was competitive enough since Glenn McGrath, who averages 4.8 with the ball in this competition was fit and well and prowling in the pavilion. How they must pine for Hick to show the same authority on Thursday at Lord's. </p> <p>He gave Caddick due respect. As usual, Somerset bowled their England fast bowler straight through; there were four maidens in his spell and plenty of steep bounce. </p> <p>Hick was cagey, recognising that there would be easy pickings later on.

      "bodyText": "In its own right this was an important match since Worcestershire and Somerset are the top two teams in the first division of the National League. But there were intriguing games within the game as well. When Andrew Caddick was bowling to Graeme Hick on a typically bouncy Taunton surface the cricket was of the highest calibre - two quality performers testing one another out; the subsequent duel between Keith Parsons and David Leatherdale was perhaps less entrancing. And there was the chance to compare and contrast two of the brightest young cricketers in the coun try, Marcus Trescothick and Vikram Solanki. Or there would have been if Solanki had not edged the first ball of the match, delivered by Caddick, towards second slip, where Trescothick briefly juggled it before completing the catch. Round one to Trescothick, whom West Country folk believe to be extremely unlucky not to have made the one day squad for the forthcoming triangular series (he's the highest run-scorer in the National League this year), where he might have joined - or replaced - Solanki. Thereafter there were two games going on out there. When Hick was batting, all was serene, the pitch benign and runs flowed smoothly from his bat. When anyone else was on strike it all looked rather trickier. Hick scored 101 out of Worcestershire's total of 222-8 which was competitive enough since Glenn McGrath, who averages 4.8 with the ball in this competition was fit and well and prowling in the pavilion. How they must pine for Hick to show the same authority on Thursday at Lord's. He gave Caddick due respect. As usual, Somerset bowled their England fast bowler straight through; there were four maidens in his spell and plenty of steep bounce. Hick was cagey, recognising that there would be easy pickings later on. Initially the much-improved Steffan Jones, who soon disposed of an out-of-touch Elliott Wil son, also demanded careful attention. But once the opening bowlers had been seen off the run-rate soared. There were not too many extravagant stokes from the Hick bat. Simple orthodoxy was enough. Parsons and Jarvis were glided effortlessly past the right hand of mid-on. If the ball was short, which was too often the case he pulled with awesome power and certainty. He rarely hit the field as he cruised to his century in 107 balls. It came as something of a surprise when he finally missed an attempted pull against Jarvis in the 42nd over, but by then he had done the damage. There were other significant contributions, albeit in a minor key, for the visitors. David Leatherdale was a useful ally for Hick in a 58-run partnership until he became the first of two victims in two balls for Parsons. Kadeer Ali, a 17-year-old making his one-day debut, revealed some wristy promise until he was bowled around his legs by Ian Blackwell. And at the end, the ageless Steven Rhodes, the ultimate old pro, scampered and struck the ball to good effect as he has done for the last fifteen years.

A heroic figure seemingly blessed with all the appropriate virtues and with a long and illustrious career stretching out in front of him has been felled by his own fatal flaws. Hansie Cronje is now a broken man, full of self-loathing, a victim of hubris. </p> <p>He is now painfully acknowledging those flaws. Initially we were told that Satan had taken over, a notion that appeared to shed Cronje himself of much responsibility for his wrongdoings. He's been a bit more specific while giving evidence to the King Commission. He admitted to an 'unfortunate love of money', before explaining 'I am not an alcoholic and I have never been addicted to nicotine, but I understand that there are times when you give in to temptation.' Moreover, like many who have risen rapidly to the top he must have felt impregnable, untouchable. He could beat the system and in his own mind was capable of rewriting history, of justifying what he was doing until it all became public knowledge. </p> <p>Now there is no way back. He'll never play seriously again. He could have coached or managed South African teams, English county sides, international sides and have been well rewarded - by most people's standards - for doing so. Had he accepted Glamorgan's offer to coach them 18 months ago he might not be in disgrace now. Instead all those fine performances for his country have been eroded. At best he might just be remembered with gratitude but only as the man, whose example and whose eventual open testimony (we presume) helped to rid the game of the stain of match-fixing. </p> <p>There is no money left in the game for Cronje. But there may be money to be made, if he can bear it, in the off-shoots of his personal tragedy. I'm still sufficiently short of cynicism to imagine Cronje wanting to profit from his predicament, but then I never believed that he could entwine himself with dodgy bookmakers and punters in the first place. </p> <p> The Observer spoke to Max Clifford, the agent who has piloted many media targets - from politicians' mistresses, to multiple-birth mothers to Geoffrey Boycott - through the trained telescopic sights of Fleet Street, and he is sure that Cronje could make a lot of money. </p> <p>'It depends, of course, on what he is prepared to say but although I am not an expert on the game myself, everything I hear suggests that there are still more names to be named and stories to be uncovered,' he said. 'Hansie Cronje is seen as the man who has destroyed the credibility of international cricket. He is big news. </p> <p>'At the same time editors would not want to be seen to be paying him vast amounts of money because, basically, he has admitted to being a crook. But there is the defence of criminal immunity in South Africa and the fact that he has not been convicted of anything at present. Editors will also argue public interest in revealing what has happened to the sport. </p> <p>'The interest, I suggest, is basically the British market. For his revelatory story in a British newspaper alone I'd say the value is \u00a3100,000. On top of that you could have a fast-turnaround book deal and it may make more sense to do that first and serialise the text in a newspaper. He would need to come up with two or three new stories and find one or two so far unknown names to give that increased value. There is no doubt in my mind, properly handled, that he could make at least \u00a3500,000 out of his story. But it could be very much more.' </p> <p>And what about film rights? 'No I don't think so.' said Clifford. 'The Americans just don't understand the game, but an untapped market, bearing in mind the betting scandal story - is India and Bollywood. But the key to all this are the ingredients. If he comes up with something new then there is a lot of money to be made.' </p> <p>Surely not. A few months ago all those noughts would have excited him. Now his life has been publicly shredded. We presume he has been open with us. Surely he does not want to go through all that again however much he's paid. He has suffered and like most tragic figures. Once fallen they provoke not only our loathing, but our sympathy also.

There had been a terrible tragedy but he was safe, he told her.</p> <p>She was spared the dreadful wait which other parents across Britain are still enduring as the slow process continues of identifying those who died in an arson attack on an Australian backpackers' hostel.</p> <p>Since the fire on Friday morning, 15 have been confirmed dead, and there are fears that at least another six bodies also lie inside the Palace Backpackers' hostel in Childers, Queensland. At least six of the dead are British, a further one is thought to be Irish. The consulates of all the countries whose nationals were in the area have now been given a list of 15 names.</p> <p>Hundreds of UK parents will worry needlessly. Their child will eventually call, from a completely different town, a different hostel.</p> <p>The Australian authorities are asking all backpackers in the country to phone home immediately and internet caf\u00e9s in Queensland are allowing foreigners to write a free email to let someone back home know they are safe.</p> <p>A website has been set up and heartrending messages are posted. The anxiety is tangible, from the German 'mama and papa' begging for information to 'mammy and daddy and Wendy from Llanelli', desperately appealing for Sarah to call. A message from one US mother was typical: 'I just want to hear that you're not in Childers.'</p> <p>Alexander Downer, Foreign Affairs Minister, was visibly moved on Australian television as he appealed to backpackers: 'For heaven's sake, ring home and tell your families you are all right.'</p> <p>Telephone lines set up for relatives have been swamped and calls are still coming in.</p> <p>The family of Sarah Williams, from the Welsh village of Aberfan, and her friend Natalie Morris, from nearby Cefn Coed, now know the two have perished. Their friend, Kelly Symonds, 23, escaped the blaze to tell the emergency services that her young friends had not.</p> <p>Louise Brewster, 19, and boyfriend Derek Bailey, 22, were luckier. Like many of the young people in Childers they had been earning extra cash picking courgettes and fruit from farms in the area.</p> <p>They had been turned away from the Palace on Thursday because it was full. They camped nearby instead.</p> <p>Louise's father, Richard, of Watton-at-Stone, Hertfordshire, had a horrifying 15 minutes on Friday morning.

      "bodyText": "Jill Griffiths is one of the lucky ones. Her son, Neil, called her in the early hours of the morning, before she had time to see the television news or read a newspaper. There had been a terrible tragedy but he was safe, he told her. She was spared the dreadful wait which other parents across Britain are still enduring as the slow process continues of identifying those who died in an arson attack on an Australian backpackers' hostel. Since the fire on Friday morning, 15 have been confirmed dead, and there are fears that at least another six bodies also lie inside the Palace Backpackers' hostel in Childers, Queensland. At least six of the dead are British, a further one is thought to be Irish. The consulates of all the countries whose nationals were in the area have now been given a list of 15 names. Hundreds of UK parents will worry needlessly. Their child will eventually call, from a completely different town, a different hostel. The Australian authorities are asking all backpackers in the country to phone home immediately and internet caf\u00e9s in Queensland are allowing foreigners to write a free email to let someone back home know they are safe. A website has been set up and heartrending messages are posted. The anxiety is tangible, from the German 'mama and papa' begging for information to 'mammy and daddy and Wendy from Llanelli', desperately appealing for Sarah to call. A message from one US mother was typical: 'I just want to hear that you're not in Childers.' Alexander Downer, Foreign Affairs Minister, was visibly moved on Australian television as he appealed to backpackers: 'For heaven's sake, ring home and tell your families you are all right.' Telephone lines set up for relatives have been swamped and calls are still coming in. The family of Sarah Williams, from the Welsh village of Aberfan, and her friend Natalie Morris, from nearby Cefn Coed, now know the two have perished. Their friend, Kelly Symonds, 23, escaped the blaze to tell the emergency services that her young friends had not. Louise Brewster, 19, and boyfriend Derek Bailey, 22, were luckier. Like many of the young people in Childers they had been earning extra cash picking courgettes and fruit from farms in the area. They had been turned away from the Palace on Thursday because it was full. They camped nearby instead. Louise's father, Richard, of Watton-at-Stone, Hertfordshire, had a horrifying 15 minutes on Friday morning. 'We heard about the fire at 7am on the Friday morning and were very worried for about a quarter of an hour until Louise phoned. 'She said she had a lucky escape. She was very composed on the phone, I don't think the shock had hit her.' Gary Paton, 20, from Milngavie, Glasgow, sobbed as he told his father how his friends had died. His father, Willie, said: 'He phoned me at half past five in the morning just to say that there had been a fire in the hostel where he was staying and that he was okay.

'She still keeps hearing glass breaking and people shouting. I'm a very lucky mother, but there's others that are not so lucky.' As Australian police named 37-year-old Robert Long as the man they want to question in connection with the fire, The Observer can reveal the dreadful safety record of Australia's budget accommodation. The country's politicians have been calling for better fire control systems in backpackers' accommodation since 1981 when nine young travellers died in a fire in Sydney. In 1989 an arsonist killed six, including a British man, again in a Sydney hostel. Between 1981 and 1997, a total of 47 backpackers have died in fires at hostels across Australia and hundreds of others have survived up to 20 arson attacks. Survivors of Friday's fire reported hearing no fire alarms but fire commissioner Jeff Wright said the building had smoke detectors and reg ular safety checks. But a spokesman for the Queensland fire authority confirmed to The Observer that building owners could not be forced to install fire alarms. Yesterday Paul Pearce, the mayor of Waverley in Sydney, said it can take up to 12 months to close an unsafe hostel and it was virtually impossible to prosecute. 'Meantime, you have a possibly unsafe hostel operating in an undesirable area,' he said. But for backpackers' families the wait goes on. 'I weep to think of them,' said Jill Griffiths, who yesterday received a graphic email from 24-year-old Neil, describing his ordeal.

      "body": "<p>Kevin Keegan needs more time, we are told by his employers at the Football Association. Like Alan Shearer, it should be more time to spend with his family. </p> <p>For a watershed moment has arrived in the English game, one that the FA ignores at its and the national team's peril. It must dredge its soul for courage; the courage to thank their personable but inadequate coach then tell him that the unequal struggle is over. And the courage, for the first time, to appoint a foreign replacement. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger does not so much spring to mind as stare us in the face. Give him G\u00e9rard Houllier, too, as technical director. </p> <p>What would it cost to prise them from jobs they prize at Arsenal and Liverpool? Compensation of several millions to their clubs and \u00a32 million pounds each a year perhaps. A package adding up to the market value of Emile Heskey. Hmm. Tough choice, that, as to which might serve England better. </p> <p>The FA has money coming out of its ears. It must have, to have taken more staff to Euro 2000 than there were players in the squad. </p> <p>What it patently lacks is the knowledge and expertise, the awareness of trends in the European and World games, that would enable English players to compete once more in those theatres rather than return them humiliated to the repertories of the Premiership where, once they have rediscovered their timing in a month or two, they will be lauded anew - and probably rightly - as talented performers. </p> <p>Wenger has two more years to serve at Highbury, but one senses that already he is thinking ahead. Japan have tried, and will surely do so again, to tempt him back to the Far East in time for the World Cup of 2002. Last week, he was advanced as a possible coach of Germany though he was quick to rule himself out. For a devoted Anglophile, with a detached fondness for its culture, England could appeal enormously, however. </p> <p>What the German interest did illustrate was their willingness now to accept that they no longer have the wherewithal to solve their own serious shortcomings. Giovanni Trapattoni is being considered as Erich Ribbeck's replacement as head coach. If the Germans can show such humility, then it is surely not too much to expect of England? </p> <p>There would undoubtedly be differences - for the better. Wenger would surely bring the pace, passing and movement that characterises his football. Believe it or not, despite the evidence of the past fortnight, English players are also capable of such. Just look at how Ray Parlour developed under him at Arsenal. And despite Wenger's tranquil bearing, derived from his fascination for Zen Buddhism acquired during his management of Grampus 8 of Nagoya, there beats a passion for the game within him that is in harmony with the English. </p> <p>He has always loved, he once said, the reservoir of spirit and commitment of English teams when, say, 2-0 down. In a similar situation other teams can give up the ghost. Unexpected sides, such as Romania and Spain, may have discovered resilience but it remains an English trump card. The problem is that they lead with it too often. Wenger would simply make better use of the hand dealt. </p> <p>Then add Houllier to consult over the cards. Last Saturday, after England's win over Germany, he approached me in the bowels of the stadium at Charleroi beaming from ear to ear. He shook my hand warmly, as pleased as any Englishman in the place. He was saddened by what he witnessed at the same venue 72 hours later, and not just because of the result. </p> <p>Indeed, it has been touching these last few days talking to such people as Raddy Antic and Savo Milosevic who, among many at the tournament, are genuinely sad at the demise of a country and style of play for which they have a true soft spot. </p> <p>Houllier believes that the supervisor of a country's football should be a native, aware of the nuances of the grass roots. But it has got England nowhere so far. A fresh eye is needed. The leaving of Liverpool would grieve him, and after recently signing a new four-year contract he will be especially reluctant. But it is like asking Miss World to dance. You never know until you take the chance. Rejection is worth the potential reward. </p> <p>Sadly, there is little faith in this quarter in the FA's ability to be bold and radical. What was their response to the debacle that was their Euro 2000? 'People should not be looking for a quick fix,' said the chief executive Adam Crozier. What, then, were his organisation doing when they appointed Keegan? He has indeed proved that we ain't going to get a quick fix . Meanwhile, the chairman Geoff Thompson is insisting that the current technical director Howard Wilkinson should have more input to the senior side. Pur-lease. It reminds you of the MP who once said that the best way to get hold of Tam Dalyell was to look for a stick and he would be on the wrong end of it. </p> <p>Wilkinson, the FA seem to need reminding, is the man who, with his tactics and selection in a Wembley friendly when caretaker coach 16 months ago, merely confirmed Wenger's words last week that France are 'five to 10 years' ahead. Then he used the chaos surrounding Glenn Hoddle's departure to jock off the successful Peter Taylor from the under-21 team before leading them to yet another English shambles in the recent European Championship finals. </p> <p>Like Hoddle before him, Keegan is not thought to warm to Wilkinson and will surely bristle, if only privately, at Thompson's suggestion. Such is the FA. Politics and personality intrude upon progress. By contrast, the key personality traits of Wenger and Houllier are the absence of rampant egos. Teamwork is the thing, as the French system of the Nineties that appointed the then little-known Aime Jacquet and now Roger Lemerre has shown. </p> <p>'Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it,' wrote the American philosopher George Satanyana. Memories seem short within Lancaster Gate. There were echoes of England's campaign of 1988 this time, in the straight-lines, straitjacketed formation they were squeezed into by Keegan, undone, now as then, by devious foreign johnnies who insist on moving about a bit instead of staying where they should have. </p> <p>Some will point out that the FA stuck with Bobby Robson then, after he had offered his resignation, and were rewarded with a memorable World Cup in 1990. That relied though on the emergence of Paul Gascoigne and on senior players approaching Robson during the tournament to suggest a change to a sweeper system. </p> <p>If Keegan does remain coach, such an event could well happen again. Indeed, at the England base in Spa, several players did discuss with him the need for a change of approach to save the team from being outnumbered in midfield. When he did bring on Nick Barmby and Steven Gerrard against Germany at the expense of a striker, albeit the wrong one, England suddenly looked better balanced. </p> <p>He failed to absorb the lesson, however. Against Romania we again had Emile and the defectives. This time for bad measure we had poor Gareth Southgate looking bemused as Keegan tried to explain to him that he wanted him to go on and stick to Adrian Mutu, Georghe Hagi's replacement, in midfield. It echoed that moment in Norway in 1993 when Nigel Clough tried to make sense of Graham Taylor, whom Keegan is beginning to resemble. </p> <p>I feel sorry for the players. Southgate, previously so capable for England but so bafflingly overlooked now, could have gone on and done the same sweeping job that he does so well for Aston Villa and a striker withdrawn to midfield to staunch the haem orrhaging, instead of being asked to spill blood chasing lost causes. Ironically, I understand Keegan was contemplating introducing a 3-5-2 starting line-up against Italy in the quarter-final but he hesitated against Romania and was lost. </p> <p>Keegan said that England simply did not pass the ball well, no matter the tactics or system. How are they supposed to amid a confused pattern of play which sees an often unsupported man with the ball given only a difficult option rather than several easier? With Gerrard injured, he did not have enough midfield alternatives, he added. Why then did he take two strikers, in Robbie Fowler and Kevin Phillips who did not play rather than more versatile players? </p> <p>Enough already. The anger is starting to well up again. I do not believe that England's players, man for man, are worse than Portugal's or Romania's or that there is insufficient quality in the country. There were enough good players in 1996 and a large majority of them remain, along with a young promising crop, among them Gerrard, Gareth Barry and Joe Gascoigne, sorry Cole. </p> <p>The worry is that they will flounder in the current stormy sea, rather than bask on the beach of a new, nurturing national team environment. The chances are remote that they and the existing experienced players, who are still needed, will ever be properly empowered by their leader in the way they were by Terry Venables in 1996. </p> <p>That time, his time may sadly have gone. Keegan's certainly has. He speaks of having 10 weeks to rethink before the World Cup qualifying match against Germany at Wembley on 8 October. The time for English football to escape its denial is shorter than it thinks. Enough of King Kev. Vive le Roi. </p>",

Like the English, their club game has been so all-embracing and high-achieving as to fuel the feeling that, surely, the national team will win something one of these days. So far, it has been only the European Championship of 1964 and the football tournament of the Olympic Games they hosted in 1992. </p> <p>Is the team that so thrillingly, astonishingly, overcame Yugoslavia in 96 breathtaking minutes in Bruges in midweek finally the one?

'Psychologically this victory will greatly help them,' Raddy Antic, once of Luton Town, twice manager of Real Madrid and a Yugoslav himself, told me, having regained his breath after that dramatic two-goal, back-from-the-brink finale.

In tournaments, particularly in the group stages, the foundation is a niggardly defence, of which the Spanish game is in short supply. </p> <p>Besides, not all think Spain have fallen so far short. 'The distance has maybe been one minute sometimes,' says Josep Guardiola, deemed man of the match on Wednesday night, though the opinion from this privileged press seat was that the ubiquitous Ivan Helguera just pipped 'Pep'. But then Guardiola has his gold medal from '92, which may not mean much to the British, for whom the politics of sport and football dictate that they do not enter the Olympic Games, but does to the rest of the world. </p> <p>'Football,' he added, 'is not always black and white. Sometimes it is grey.' Did he mean the Euro 96 quarter-final against England, when a good goal - by no less than Julio Salinas - was ruled offside and should have sent them through? 'Maybe,' he replied. </p> <p>If nothing else, as with England's though less admirable win over Germany, the display against Yugoslavia has at least won them a nation's indulgence for a little while. This one deserves to. It was indeed a match that had skill and courage and incident, for good and bad, of every kind. At times, a terrible beauty of a game. The complete game. If it was too error-strewn for the purist of a previous era, one can only respond that at such a pace and intensity it was inevitable. </p> <p>It was almost like watching the best of games from La Liga , not surprising since five of the Yugoslavs used to ply their trade in Spain, and lifted the spirits after Charleroi's dross 24 hours earlier. It had the bonus of sending home a Norway who bring scarcely anything to a major tournament, save redeemingly likeable supporters. </p> <p> 'Un gran partido,' said the Spain coach, Jose Camacho, before adding: 'I will have to think about that,' when asked if it was the most memorable game of his career, though with nine Championships, the Copa Del Rey four times, a Uefa Cup and 81 caps as a player with Real Madrid, his hesitation was understandable. One day perhaps... </p> <p>The professional in Yugoslavia's canny Vujadin Boskov, a man well-versed in Spanish footballing culture having managed Real Zaragoza, Real Madrid and Sporting Gijon, could not resist lamenting injuries, a red card and and the referee's performance but eventually he conceded that, yes, it had been 'satisfaction to have played those 90 minutes'.

      "body": "<p>Frank Rijkaard began the interview by offering me a Barclays cigarette. The Dutch coach is a polite and kind man. Former team-mates like Arnold Muhren and Gerald Vanenburg talk about him with something approaching love. Even Johan Cruyff hesitates to criticise him. Rijkaard is a nice guy. </p> <p>So it was a shock, early in Euro 2000, to see him erupt. He had publicly erupted only once before, at the World Cup of 1990, when as a player he was sent off for spitting at the German Rudi Voller. Outside Holland he is still known chiefly for this most uncharacteristic act, and I hereby apologise for using it as the cover photograph of a book I wrote. </p> <p>Rijkaard's second eruption came ten days ago at the Dutch camp in Hoenderloo. It is his custom to address press conferences in the slow and simple speech of a kind primary school teacher talking to backward children. This time he exploded. </p> <p>'When there is a Euro 2000 game on TV, I sometimes walk past my players, and I see them watching with half an eye or playing cards. In the match on TV you see everyone running the fire out of their slippers, but then you see our guys look up briefly at the television set and you hear: \"What a bad game!\"' </p> <p>It was a perfect cameo of the Dutch professional footballer. But Rijkaard was not trying to be funny. The man who became Holland's manager as fourth or fifth choice after the last World Cup is no caretaker. He may never have coached a team before, and never have aspired to this job, but he wants to transform Dutch football. And he knows exactly how he wants to do it, because he once transformed himself. </p> <p>Rijkaard was born 37 years ago in Amsterdam. His father, a gifted black footballer named Herman Rijkaard, had taken the boat from the Dutch West Indian colony of Surinam with his friend and fellow player George Gullit. Both men had married white Dutch women, and settled near one another in Amsterdam. It was years before the great rush of Surinamese immigrants that was to bring the Kluivert, Seedorf and Davids families to Holland, where they would be stuck in ghettoes. The Rijkaards and Gullits were part of a small group of middle-class Surinamese men who were accepted fairly easily into Dutch society. Ruud Gullit says he only discovered he was black when he was ten years old. </p> <p>He and Rijkaard grew up playing football together on a local square, the Balboaplein, and at the DWS club of Amsterdam. Even as a teenager Gullit was the louder and more confident of the two, but experts such as Johan Cruyff thought Rijkaard the more gifted footballer. He was huge, intelligent, and could do everything with a football. </p> <p>He joined Ajax, and at 18 made his debut for Holland against Switzerland. Gullit replaced him at half-time, but the Swiss commentator never noticed the switch. Holland lost the match 2-1. The Dutch team, composed of naive youngsters like Gullit, Rijkaard and Marco van Basten, lost often in those days. They failed to qualify for the World Cups of 1982 and 1986 and the European Championship of 1984. </p> <p>Experts said they would never make it: pretty footballers, but lacking in bite and with a penchant for conceding silly goals. Ajax eventually decided to discard Rijkaard. They offered him to Groningen, a small club in the north of Holland, but Groningen didn't want him. The young man's reputation had been destroyed by the Ajax coach, Aad de Mos, who had said after Ajax had yet again exited the European Cup in the autumn: 'You won't win the war with boys like Rijkaard and (Gerald) Vanenburg.' </p> <p>The saying has become legendary. Rijkaard told me: 'The question was: how do you deal with it? I looked in the mirror and thought: \"Yes, football is about something. It's not just a game for fun.\" So from that moment on I began to fight, to stand my man, and after every match I could look in the mirror and say, \"Good or bad, I did what was within my power\".' </p> <p>This sounds like the pop psychology books that Rijkaard reads. You may mock, but there is no quibbling with the results. De Mos was proved right: Rijkaard never won a war. Instead he won the European Cup twice with AC Milan and once with Ajax, and the European Championship with Holland in 1988. By the time he retired in 1995 he was one of the most respected players in football. </p> <p>The Dutch team today is an eleven-man version of the young Rijkaard: pretty footballers, who lose when it counts. The one great prize most of them have won was the Champions League with Ajax in 1995, when they were led from the back by a centre-half named Rijkaard who gave them a talking-to at half-time in the final. </p> <p>Now Rijkaard must motivate them again. Dutch footballers need that. Left to themselves, they tend to elevate good football above winning. Hence the Hoenderloo speech. </p> <p>But Rijkaard is no Kevin Keegan, no orator. He is a man of detail. 'That's what surprises me most about Frank,' says Dennis Bergkamp, another former team-mate. 'He really knows how to analyse an opponent completely.' </p> <p>Rijkaard has specific advice to impart. Much of it is on a subject the Dutch traditionally disdain: defending. He gave me a masterclass. </p> <p>'As a young centre-back at Ajax, I played with Wim Jansen, and of course you learn a huge amount. I made some mistakes, because we Dutchmen want to solve situations by playing football. So we look at the ball, try to judge where it will come. Eight out of ten times it's wonderful if you intercept it. \"What vision!\" people say. But the other two times the ball goes in behind your back and it's really just a marking error. </p> <p>'Then came the moment that I joined the squad for the European Championship of 1988 and it became clear that I'd have to play centre-back. One thing was crystal clear to me: if you're centre-back, you first of all have to perform your task. </p> <p>'What I did was watch the striker very closely. If the ball went to the wing, I would touch him so that I knew if he was going forward or backwards.And then he went forward and I was with him. Very often I was lying in between when someone wanted to shoot, or I gave a little push when someone wanted to head. I mean, it doesn't always go right, but that was the intention. For me it was living proof that that is how you defend.' </p> <p>Indeed: this most cultured of footballers erased strikers like Gary Lineker and Oleg Protassov from games. It is a shame he finished only third in the voting for player of the tournament, behind his more obvious team-mates Van Basten (scored five goals) and Gullit (wore long Rastafarian hair). </p> <p>Rijkaard continued: 'After your career you go to matches and you see so many unnecessary goals. Because a person is just looking where the ball is and not his opponent. Well, a ball alone has never scored a goal.' </p> <p>Throwing yourself in front of the ball, says Rijkaard, might sound mucky but can be the difference between winning and losing. That difference has traditionally been of little interest to the Dutch. Cruyff himself says that Holland in effect won the World Cup of 1974, even though they lost in the final, because everyone remembers their beautiful play. </p> <p>Rijkaard diagrees. He grew up watching Cruyff, was coached by him at Ajax, quarrelled with him many times, eventually walked out, and landed up at AC Milan. There he became something of an Italian. Even today he is distinguished among the casual Dutch by his tailored Italian suits, and at Euro 2000 press conferences he demonstrates an excellent use of the language. (His English is also excellent, and this tournament he has occasionally assisted his translator, the cricket-loving Dutch press officer Rob de Leede.) </p> <p>In Italy, as Cruyff notes with a certain wonder, what matters is winning. Rijkaard imbibed that. Why, I asked him, did Holland switch recently from white shorts to the black ones they wore in the 1970s? </p> <p>'This all sounds a bit airy,' said Rijkaard, 'because it's not about the shorts, but I felt that black emits more power. White: clean, neat and attractive, attractive football. Black is that you throw yourself in front of the ball in the last minute and prevent a goal. It's a feeling. That's why I chose it.' </p> <p>Until this week, this was all just talk. Only at Euro 2000 is Rijkaard starting to prove himself. For two years beforehand his team played only friendlies. At one point they went 16 months without winning a game, making him Holland's least successful manager since 1951. The leader of the far-left Socialist Party demanded his dismissal. </p> <p>Rijkaard experimented endlessly, yet began Euro 2000 with a shaky 1-0 win against the Czech Republic. He then dropped Clarence Seedorf, who had also been dropped by Rijkaard's predecessor, Guus Hiddink, after the first match of the World Cup. The first half of Holland's second game, against Denmark, was scoreless and depressing. Then Rijkaard brought on Ronald de Boer for Marc Overmars, and moved Boudewijn Zenden to the left wing. Now Holland were playing with ten of the players who had started the semi-final of the World Cup against Brazil under Hiddink two years ago, nine of them playing in the same positions they had then. Almost instantly the Dutch scored three goals. </p> <p>In the game against France, a somewhat makeshift team played a recognisable version of Hiddink's system. What, then, has Rijkaard contributed? 'The core was clear even then,' he admits. The style, too, has scarcely changed. The Dutch school - one-touch passing, use of the wings, attack - dates back to the 1960s and was restored by Cruyff when he became manager of Ajax in 1985. Rijkaard, a member of the Dutch footballing establishment, does not question it. </p> <p>But he aims to add a crucial nuance: defence. This Dutch side is more calculating than most of its predecessors. Frank de Boer sticks behind his defence almost like an Italian sweeper, Ronald de Boer dived to win a crucial penalty against the Czechs, and the keepers have been hitting long punts at Patrick Kluivert's head. So far it has worked: after going 3-2 up against France with an hour to play, Holland slowed down the game and barely gave away a chance - it would have done a good German side proud. </p> <p>Rijkaard has achieved something else: he has made the Dutch camp perhaps the most harmonious of Euro 2000. The foreign stereotype that the Dutch are about to start eating each other is just that - a foreign stereotype. This week Seedorf told an Italian newspaper that the Dutch press is racist, but even a statement as raw as that failed to split the players into two camps of rival colours, as briefly happened at Euro 96. </p> <p>'Guus Hiddink tore down that barrier,' Rijkaard told me. 'I have continued his line. Keeping an eye on who sits at which table at meals, seeing who rooms with whom. I made Edgar Davids vice-captain. Nothing to do with colour, just because he was playing excellently and because he lives like an athlete. But those are all details that change things in the group. The relations are now totally equal.' </p> <p>Rijkaard deserves great credit for this. It is not simply that he is half black and half white, in the same way that as a coach he is part Dutch and part Italian. It is also that he is an impressive character. </p> <p>Everyone respects him. The black players grew up with his poster on their walls. No one would ever suspect him of pandering to anyone. He may not be a great coach, but there is general agreement that he is a good man. </p> <p>As we leave his office, he shows me a card bearing a Chinese character that was given him by Chinese journalists. 'It's my name in Chinese,' he says. 'At least I hope it's my name in Chinese. It might be a curse.' </p> <p>Rijkaard could win Euro 2000 and still be cursed. His compatriots want Holland to attack. Winning alone is not enough. Italy were lauded at home for winning their first three games in cowardly fashion. But as Rijkaard presumably knows, Holland is not Italy. In Holland, the suits, the food and the defenders are all much worse.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Frank Rijkaard began the interview by offering me a Barclays cigarette. The Dutch coach is a polite and kind man. Former team-mates like Arnold Muhren and Gerald Vanenburg talk about him with something approaching love. Even Johan Cruyff hesitates to criticise him. Rijkaard is a nice guy. So it was a shock, early in Euro 2000, to see him erupt. He had publicly erupted only once before, at the World Cup of 1990, when as a player he was sent off for spitting at the German Rudi Voller. Outside Holland he is still known chiefly for this most uncharacteristic act, and I hereby apologise for using it as the cover photograph of a book I wrote. Rijkaard's second eruption came ten days ago at the Dutch camp in Hoenderloo. It is his custom to address press conferences in the slow and simple speech of a kind primary school teacher talking to backward children. This time he exploded. 'When there is a Euro 2000 game on TV, I sometimes walk past my players, and I see them watching with half an eye or playing cards. In the match on TV you see everyone running the fire out of their slippers, but then you see our guys look up briefly at the television set and you hear: \"What a bad game!\"' It was a perfect cameo of the Dutch professional footballer. But Rijkaard was not trying to be funny. The man who became Holland's manager as fourth or fifth choice after the last World Cup is no caretaker. He may never have coached a team before, and never have aspired to this job, but he wants to transform Dutch football. And he knows exactly how he wants to do it, because he once transformed himself. Rijkaard was born 37 years ago in Amsterdam. His father, a gifted black footballer named Herman Rijkaard, had taken the boat from the Dutch West Indian colony of Surinam with his friend and fellow player George Gullit. Both men had married white Dutch women, and settled near one another in Amsterdam. It was years before the great rush of Surinamese immigrants that was to bring the Kluivert, Seedorf and Davids families to Holland, where they would be stuck in ghettoes. The Rijkaards and Gullits were part of a small group of middle-class Surinamese men who were accepted fairly easily into Dutch society. Ruud Gullit says he only discovered he was black when he was ten years old. He and Rijkaard grew up playing football together on a local square, the Balboaplein, and at the DWS club of Amsterdam. Even as a teenager Gullit was the louder and more confident of the two, but experts such as Johan Cruyff thought Rijkaard the more gifted footballer. He was huge, intelligent, and could do everything with a football. He joined Ajax, and at 18 made his debut for Holland against Switzerland. Gullit replaced him at half-time, but the Swiss commentator never noticed the switch. Holland lost the match 2-1. The Dutch team, composed of naive youngsters like Gullit, Rijkaard and Marco van Basten, lost often in those days. They failed to qualify for the World Cups of 1982 and 1986 and the European Championship of 1984. Experts said they would never make it: pretty footballers, but lacking in bite and with a penchant for conceding silly goals. Ajax eventually decided to discard Rijkaard. They offered him to Groningen, a small club in the north of Holland, but Groningen didn't want him. The young man's reputation had been destroyed by the Ajax coach, Aad de Mos, who had said after Ajax had yet again exited the European Cup in the autumn: 'You won't win the war with boys like Rijkaard and (Gerald) Vanenburg.' The saying has become legendary. Rijkaard told me: 'The question was: how do you deal with it? I looked in the mirror and thought: \"Yes, football is about something. It's not just a game for fun.\" So from that moment on I began to fight, to stand my man, and after every match I could look in the mirror and say, \"Good or bad, I did what was within my power\".' This sounds like the pop psychology books that Rijkaard reads. You may mock, but there is no quibbling with the results. De Mos was proved right: Rijkaard never won a war. Instead he won the European Cup twice with AC Milan and once with Ajax, and the European Championship with Holland in 1988. By the time he retired in 1995 he was one of the most respected players in football. The Dutch team today is an eleven-man version of the young Rijkaard: pretty footballers, who lose when it counts. The one great prize most of them have won was the Champions League with Ajax in 1995, when they were led from the back by a centre-half named Rijkaard who gave them a talking-to at half-time in the final. Now Rijkaard must motivate them again. Dutch footballers need that. Left to themselves, they tend to elevate good football above winning. Hence the Hoenderloo speech. But Rijkaard is no Kevin Keegan, no orator. He is a man of detail. 'That's what surprises me most about Frank,' says Dennis Bergkamp, another former team-mate. 'He really knows how to analyse an opponent completely.' Rijkaard has specific advice to impart. Much of it is on a subject the Dutch traditionally disdain: defending. He gave me a masterclass. 'As a young centre-back at Ajax, I played with Wim Jansen, and of course you learn a huge amount. I made some mistakes, because we Dutchmen want to solve situations by playing football. So we look at the ball, try to judge where it will come. Eight out of ten times it's wonderful if you intercept it. \"What vision!\" people say. But the other two times the ball goes in behind your back and it's really just a marking error. 'Then came the moment that I joined the squad for the European Championship of 1988 and it became clear that I'd have to play centre-back. One thing was crystal clear to me: if you're centre-back, you first of all have to perform your task. 'What I did was watch the striker very closely. If the ball went to the wing, I would touch him so that I knew if he was going forward or backwards.And then he went forward and I was with him. Very often I was lying in between when someone wanted to shoot, or I gave a little push when someone wanted to head. I mean, it doesn't always go right, but that was the intention. For me it was living proof that that is how you defend.' Indeed: this most cultured of footballers erased strikers like Gary Lineker and Oleg Protassov from games. It is a shame he finished only third in the voting for player of the tournament, behind his more obvious team-mates Van Basten (scored five goals) and Gullit (wore long Rastafarian hair). Rijkaard continued: 'After your career you go to matches and you see so many unnecessary goals. Because a person is just looking where the ball is and not his opponent. Well, a ball alone has never scored a goal.' Throwing yourself in front of the ball, says Rijkaard, might sound mucky but can be the difference between winning and losing. That difference has traditionally been of little interest to the Dutch. Cruyff himself says that Holland in effect won the World Cup of 1974, even though they lost in the final, because everyone remembers their beautiful play. Rijkaard diagrees. He grew up watching Cruyff, was coached by him at Ajax, quarrelled with him many times, eventually walked out, and landed up at AC Milan. There he became something of an Italian. Even today he is distinguished among the casual Dutch by his tailored Italian suits, and at Euro 2000 press conferences he demonstrates an excellent use of the language. (His English is also excellent, and this tournament he has occasionally assisted his translator, the cricket-loving Dutch press officer Rob de Leede.) In Italy, as Cruyff notes with a certain wonder, what matters is winning. Rijkaard imbibed that. Why, I asked him, did Holland switch recently from white shorts to the black ones they wore in the 1970s? 'This all sounds a bit airy,' said Rijkaard, 'because it's not about the shorts, but I felt that black emits more power. White: clean, neat and attractive, attractive football. Black is that you throw yourself in front of the ball in the last minute and prevent a goal. It's a feeling. That's why I chose it.' Until this week, this was all just talk. Only at Euro 2000 is Rijkaard starting to prove himself. For two years beforehand his team played only friendlies.

'Guus Hiddink tore down that barrier,' Rijkaard told me. 'I have continued his line. Keeping an eye on who sits at which table at meals, seeing who rooms with whom. I made Edgar Davids vice-captain. Nothing to do with colour, just because he was playing excellently and because he lives like an athlete. But those are all details that change things in the group.

Five of Euro 2000's eight quarter-finalists hail from the Mediterranean, symbolic of a shift in power away from the physical north and towards the stirring, soulful style of the south. Turkey joined Italy, France, Spain and, as far as he is concerned, best of the lot Portugal. </p> <p>This was by no means the most seductive show so far from Humberto Coelho's delightful team. Still, they cannot help but impress. Not too long ago they might have allowed themselves to be outscrapped by an increasingly gutsy Turkey, but now they have a work ethic to match their wit. Upon that firm foundation they showed flashes of the dazzle which has won them so many friends in the Low Countries. </p> <p>The spiritual home of total football warmed to a team capable of expert technique and fluid movement.

      "bodyText": "Mustafa Denizli has noticed an intriguing new trend in European football. Five of Euro 2000's eight quarter-finalists hail from the Mediterranean, symbolic of a shift in power away from the physical north and towards the stirring, soulful style of the south. Turkey joined Italy, France, Spain and, as far as he is concerned, best of the lot Portugal. This was by no means the most seductive show so far from Humberto Coelho's delightful team. Still, they cannot help but impress. Not too long ago they might have allowed themselves to be outscrapped by an increasingly gutsy Turkey, but now they have a work ethic to match their wit. Upon that firm foundation they showed flashes of the dazzle which has won them so many friends in the Low Countries. The spiritual home of total football warmed to a team capable of expert technique and fluid movement. A shimmy from Figo, a dribble from Conceicao, a surge from Rui Costa, and now they even possess the finishing touch in the shape of the exuberant Nuno Gomes. Johan Cruyff, who has been so critical of the current Dutch incarnation, might even find them pleasing. Portugal's supremely gifted adventurous proved a hurdle too far for Turkey. Playing with 10 men for more than an hour after Alpay was ordered off - for clouting the melodramatic Fernando Couto - proved too much for a team still finding their feet at the highest level.

      "body": "<p><strong> Keown denial</strong> </p> <p>Martin Keown has hit back at reports that appeared in several newspapers suggesting he had been critical of Kevin Keegan's tactics. The England defender was quoted yesterday as saying: 'I was disturbed to read in a number of newspapers comments attributed to me - but not said by me - suggesting that I was critical of both the England team and the manager, Kevin Keegan. </p> <p>'I believe that by use of these comments there has been an orchestrated campaign to spin a story suggesting I am critical of the England set-up. </p> <p>'Nothing could be further from the truth. I... would not do or say anything to give ammunition to those who would attempt to undermine both the manager and the team.' </p> <p>He had obviously forgotten what he wrote in his own contribution to the press just the day before, in his Daily Telegraph column on Friday. </p> <p>'The bottom line is that we were inept tactically, we were exposed against teams we should have beaten, we lacked a pattern in our play at times and, ultimately, individual and collective tactical mistakes cost us dearly,' he wrote, adding, 'If you play a passing game, you have to use the right structure.' </p> <p> <strong> Body blow</strong> </p> <p>Some of the English fans arrested by the Belgian police for causing havoc in Brussels the night before England-Germany responded with a humour that was, sadly, untypical. After being wrestled onto the floor, made to lie face down and strapped into sharp-edged plastic handcuffs, a row of bodies suddenly lapsed into a chorus of Always Look on the Bright Side of Life. Their Belgian captors didn't see the funny side, however, and an officer produced his truncheon and went down the line giving each man a tap on the head until they shut up. 'It looked and sounded like someone going up the musical scale on a glockenspiel,' laughed one British security official. </p> <p> <strong> Stewards a success</strong> </p> <p>Amazingly, UEFA's controversial policy of deploying only stewards to maintain order inside match venues, rather than uniformed police, has proved a success. Although there has been trouble in the centres of Brussels and Charleroi, very few nasty incidents have occurred inside grounds. Fears that the only visible peacekeepers being civilians in blue-and-yellow stewards' kit would encourage trouble have proved misplaced. Happily, the hit-and-miss segregation seen at most games has not produced mayhem. </p> <p> <strong> Romanians in ticket probe</strong> </p> <p>The Romanian FA has been asked to explain to Uefa how about 600 England fans suddenly appeared in the Romanian end in Charleroi just before kick-off last Tuesday. 'It should have been impossible, given our strict ticketing arrangements,' said Euro 2000's Richard van der Eijk. 'All the tickets in that end were for Romanians only.' He denied these were ticketless England fans or that there had been an overspill from the three-tier main stand. So did the Romanian FA sell some of their allocation to rival fans? 'We're investigating,' says van der Eijk. </p> <p> <strong> Helpline for 'hooligans'</strong> </p> <p>Not all English fans are thugs, though, and even the Belgian police many of the 921 English fans arrested and/or deported had done nothing wrong except not carry their passport.

      "bodyText": "Keown denial Martin Keown has hit back at reports that appeared in several newspapers suggesting he had been critical of Kevin Keegan's tactics. The England defender was quoted yesterday as saying: 'I was disturbed to read in a number of newspapers comments attributed to me - but not said by me - suggesting that I was critical of both the England team and the manager, Kevin Keegan. 'I believe that by use of these comments there has been an orchestrated campaign to spin a story suggesting I am critical of the England set-up. 'Nothing could be further from the truth. I... would not do or say anything to give ammunition to those who would attempt to undermine both the manager and the team.' He had obviously forgotten what he wrote in his own contribution to the press just the day before, in his Daily Telegraph column on Friday. 'The bottom line is that we were inept tactically, we were exposed against teams we should have beaten, we lacked a pattern in our play at times and, ultimately, individual and collective tactical mistakes cost us dearly,' he wrote, adding, 'If you play a passing game, you have to use the right structure.' Body blow Some of the English fans arrested by the Belgian police for causing havoc in Brussels the night before England-Germany responded with a humour that was, sadly, untypical. After being wrestled onto the floor, made to lie face down and strapped into sharp-edged plastic handcuffs, a row of bodies suddenly lapsed into a chorus of Always Look on the Bright Side of Life. Their Belgian captors didn't see the funny side, however, and an officer produced his truncheon and went down the line giving each man a tap on the head until they shut up. 'It looked and sounded like someone going up the musical scale on a glockenspiel,' laughed one British security official. Stewards a success Amazingly, UEFA's controversial policy of deploying only stewards to maintain order inside match venues, rather than uniformed police, has proved a success. Although there has been trouble in the centres of Brussels and Charleroi, very few nasty incidents have occurred inside grounds. Fears that the only visible peacekeepers being civilians in blue-and-yellow stewards' kit would encourage trouble have proved misplaced. Happily, the hit-and-miss segregation seen at most games has not produced mayhem. Romanians in ticket probe The Romanian FA has been asked to explain to Uefa how about 600 England fans suddenly appeared in the Romanian end in Charleroi just before kick-off last Tuesday. 'It should have been impossible, given our strict ticketing arrangements,' said Euro 2000's Richard van der Eijk. 'All the tickets in that end were for Romanians only.' He denied these were ticketless England fans or that there had been an overspill from the three-tier main stand. So did the Romanian FA sell some of their allocation to rival fans? 'We're investigating,' says van der Eijk. Helpline for 'hooligans' Not all English fans are thugs, though, and even the Belgian police many of the 921 English fans arrested and/or deported had done nothing wrong except not carry their passport. That's why the Football Supporters Association yesterday launched a campaign to get compensation for anyone wrongly arrested or sent home and ensure they do not appear on future lists of 'hooligans'. Anyone who feels mistreated can ring the FSA on 020 8541 3399 or email details of what happened to them to fsa_euro2000@hotmail.com. There's only one David Beckham A survey of every group match at the tournament by Uefa's Technical Study Group (TSG), coordinated by former Scotland boss Andy Roxburgh, head of Uefa's technical department, and including ex-Blackburn manager Roy Hodgson and Liverpool coach G\u00e9rard Houllier, has produced a list of the best 50 players at these championships. And, surprise, surprise, only one England player, Manchester United's David Beckham, appears on the list. The best-represented side in the survey is Holland, with eight players among the top 50, followed by World Cup holders France, Portugal and Italy, each with seven. Portugal, with the four men - Manuel Rui Costa, Luis Figo, Sergio Conceicao and Paulo Bento - who ran rings around England in their opening match, had the most midfielders. The top 50 will be whittled down to an all-star squad of 16 after the semi-finals, with the winners being announced by Pele shortly before the final in Rotterdam on 2July. denis.campbell@observer.co.uk",

Now that I have a forum each week I decided to use my position to make a point, as much for myself as anything else. A lot of people who work in publishing or in these shops are not able to say what they think because they fear losing their jobs.' According to former colleagues at the Deansgate branch, Robert Topping is appealing against his sacking. He is also a friend of Tim Waterstone.",

Not only that, but he married my daughter. </p> <p>He arrived in late spring of 1994, to attend the wedding of my only other daughter. Knowing that the United States was to host an upcoming soccer competition that apparently was deemed by some significant, I sought to engage my future son-in-law in some small talk. </p> <p>'So, Yves,' I said, in that horribly false voice one uses towards people to whom one feels the obligation of courtesy, 'How do you think France will fare in that World Cup thing we're having over here in the summer?' </p> <p>Yves is not only a gentleman and a scholar (and, God love him, several years later, he fell sound asleep at my side during the first half of a particularly tedious Spurs/Everton match at White Hart Lane), but a young man of such congeniality and obvious good character that I would have liked him even if he had not travelled such a great distance for no other purpose than to steal my daughter from under my very nose. </p> <p>But immediately, he fired me a look of such malice and anger that I took an involuntary step backward. 'Don't speak to me,' he said, 'of this _ this _ Merde! I cannot even bear to say it: this ... World Cup!' </p> <p>And with that he was gone. </p> <p>Within minutes, I was approached by the daughter whose fianc\u00e9 he was. 'Dad!' she said, 'How could you have? Don't you know anything? Now, poor Yves is totally shattered.' </p> <p>In the hours that followed, I was able to piece together the genesis of my faux pas. It seemed that although there would be 24 countries represented at the World Cup to be hosted by America, France would not be among them, having inexplicably lost home matches against both Israel and Bulgaria the previous autumn. </p> <p>Like Mitterrand's mistresses, it was something all of France acknowledged, but certainly not a topic they enjoyed hearing discussed by outsiders. </p> <p>'And of course Yves thinks you were insulting him by asking such a question.

Three months ago, I would have told you the World Cup was a yacht race!' </p> <p>And so I started to watch, in '94, and even to attend, hoping to learn what it might be about this sport that could so quickly transform the gracious and elegant Yves Jekyll into the rabid, snarling Mr Hyde. And I did learn, and became, instantly, a fire-breathing Mr Hyde myself. </p> <p>The wedding of Yves and my daughter was to take place in south-west France at the start of September. Arriving in Bordeaux just a bit ahead of time, with my wife and two other children, I picked up the rental car intended to speed us effortlessly down the coast to our destination in the Aquitaine region. </p> <p>It was early on a weekday morning, the airport was virtually empty, most of the rental counters were deserted. My wife, having slept not at all on the aeroplane displayed just a hint of impatience. </p> <p>'What's the delay?' she asked. 'And why is that woman making a telephone call? Is there a problem with the credit card?' </p> <p>'No, no, not at all,' I said, in the same infuriatingly unctuous tone I'd employed with Yves a few months earlier. 'It's just that Bordeaux aren't playing at home this week, so I've asked her to kindly locate the nearest match we might be able see before the wedding.' </p> <p>'What are you talking about?' </p> <p>'A match, dearest. You know: Like at the World Cup.' </p> <p>'Yes, but the World Cup is over.' </p> <p>'Absolutely. But the World Cup ends only so the new league seasons can begin.' </p> <p>'Are you out of your ...' </p> <p>'Pardon.' The car-rental clerk had put down the phone and was shaking her head sadly. 'I am so very sorry,' she said, as though she'd personally been in charge of arranging dates for the new season's fixtures. </p> <p>'For the closest, you still must drive more than two 'undred kilo-me-tres in the wrong direction, and this will only bring you to Toulouse, which is very much not worthy of your trouble, for last saison they become, I don't know how...anyway, among les rel\u00e9gu\u00e9s .' </p> <p>'Ah, sent down,' I said, marvelling at the universal language of the game. </p> <p>' Tant pis ,' I said.

Let's just say that when I rose after the match to cheer the lads in purple, and to wave my little flag that said ' Rebondir ensemble' I was very much a party of one. </p> <p>And from what I'd seen during the 90 minutes that had preceded, I sensed not only that Toulouse and I would not 'go back up together,' I feared that they'd not go back up at all - not even with Roland Courbis as manager. </p> <p>But that's now history and in order to keep the upper lip stiff, we must look forward. To a France-Holland final? </p> <p>Let's give the last word to the long-suffering Yves, speaking from his redoubt in Paris's 18th arrondissement: 'I was confident in the French team,' he says, 'and does the match against Holland really count?

(France B unquestionably possess the power to beat England A. The scoreline of France A versus England B hardly bears contemplating.) </p> <p>A quarter-final against a gutsy Spain side is not the time for too many experiments or risks. This is a match with extra resonance for two returning players, Deschamps and Bixente Lizarazu, who hail from the Basque country. </p> <p>'I know this team very well,' says the fervent fullback Lizarazu. 'We have already seen the two faces of Spain in this tournament. On the one side they are slow and sluggish like they are struggling to row a boat.

The point was proved once again as 'Britian' and 'Pussy Hunter' and their tattooed chums attempted to take on water cannon with three green plastic chairs. National Disgrace. Bring Them Home. The English Disease. How Much Longer Must We.... The headlines were as predictable as the proposed solutions. Gary Lineker called for passport confiscation on a grand scale. Were such a scheme to be put into operation it would have rid the Championship of its best supporters. The English. </p> <p>Not all England football fans, perhaps, but English football fans (there is a considerable distinction) who see green plastic chairs not as potential weapons and a chance to attract the TV cameras, but as something to sit on. Passionate, knowledgeable, peaceable supporters happy to sit and drink and talk football with anyone and everyone. Fans who may be pretty relieved that the England team are back home. Their sense of relief would have come from the knowledge that they would no longer have to share the stand with fellow countrymen singing 'No Surrender To The IRA'; no longer have to avoid the Irish bars where the idiots gather to sing the National Anthem and spoil for a fight; no longer have to endure the embarrassment of seeing fat-bellied oafs face down, bloodied and handcuffed in the gutter, asking their captors, the Belgian police, 'Who won the war then?' </p> <p>England's departure from the tournament has once again led to an immediate and noticeable raising of standards, both on and off the pitch.

The point was proved once again as 'Britian' and 'Pussy Hunter' and their tattooed chums attempted to take on water cannon with three green plastic chairs. National Disgrace. Bring Them Home. The English Disease. How Much Longer Must We.... The headlines were as predictable as the proposed solutions. Gary Lineker called for passport confiscation on a grand scale. Were such a scheme to be put into operation it would have rid the Championship of its best supporters. The English. Not all England football fans, perhaps, but English football fans (there is a considerable distinction) who see green plastic chairs not as potential weapons and a chance to attract the TV cameras, but as something to sit on. Passionate, knowledgeable, peaceable supporters happy to sit and drink and talk football with anyone and everyone. Fans who may be pretty relieved that the England team are back home. Their sense of relief would have come from the knowledge that they would no longer have to share the stand with fellow countrymen singing 'No Surrender To The IRA'; no longer have to avoid the Irish bars where the idiots gather to sing the National Anthem and spoil for a fight; no longer have to endure the embarrassment of seeing fat-bellied oafs face down, bloodied and handcuffed in the gutter, asking their captors, the Belgian police, 'Who won the war then?' England's departure from the tournament has once again led to an immediate and noticeable raising of standards, both on and off the pitch. At every game there are more English (and many Scots too) in attendance than neutrals of any other nationality bar the hosts. Even this weekend there are probably as many English fans in Holland and Belgium as there are Spanish.

It could serve as a motto for the whole city, for this is Bristol, a town built for real working people from the proceeds of their labour in its port. </p> <p>But what does a city do when the reason for its very existence has literally sailed away? Handsome Bristol's docks have long been silent, but a buccaneering spirit still lurks there down by the water, playing its part in the city's renaissance. Looking out from Cabot's Tower high above the city centre, a huge roofscape lies below, the river twisting through it like a silver-grey eel. Great ships no longer unload their cargoes here, but the quaysides are far from derelict. Like London and Liverpool, the waterfront is revitalised with bars, internet caf\u00e9s, floating restaurants, bookshops, galleries and health clubs. </p> <p>This is a city of constant variety; ancient buildings set against, for the most part, imaginative, modern civic development - the new Broad Quay water feature, for instance (all fountains, weirs, masts and rigging), reminding Bristolians of their city's former reliance on the sea. And some great civic disasters are being set right. Queen Square, crammed with beautiful Georgian houses, had a dual carriageway driven through it by a Sixties planner, but now it is being returned to its former splendour, the road ripped up and grass replacing tarmac. </p> <p>An astonishing \u00a3450 million is being spent on redeveloping a harbourside area to the west of the city centre towards the Anglican cathedral. Called @Bristol, it aims to entertain with a mix of nature, science and art. Explore @Bristol, due to open on 6 July, will show how science and technology affect our lives. Wildscreen @Bristol, opening on 20 July, will focus on the diversity of the natural world with a walk-through botanical house filled with live butterflies and birds and the only Imax cinema in the South-West: an appropriate attraction in a city that is home to the world-famous BBC Wildlife Unit. A planetarium - a giant silver sphere called Imaginarium - is also under construction. </p> <p>So Bristol is looking forward to the future with confidence, but its past is equally fascinating. The money that poured in off the dockside was ploughed into fine houses and great churches; St Mary Redcliffe, for instance, is a massive perpendicular gem, far richer than the bigger cathedral across the water and considered one of the finest churches in the world. </p> <p>Clifton must be one of England's most beautiful suburbs. Once a village, it became a highly desirable address in the late eighteenth century when richer Bristolians built fine houses on Clifton Down, up above the noise and bustle of the quayside. It's really rewarding to stroll around. Grand terraces with balconies of decorated wrought iron overlook open green spaces, the dramatic Avon Gorge and the city's best-known icon, the Clifton Suspension Bridge by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, the Victorian engineer who built the Great Western Railway, Temple Meads station and the SS Great Britain, the largest ship of her day, now lying in her original dry dock in the harbour below. </p> <p>It's difficult to believe, but ships once carried their cargoes right to the door of Bristol's new Hotel du Vin, an imaginative conversion of a series of city-centre warehouses. Mr Reed's Sugar House was built in 1728 when the River Frome flowed past its front door and the hotel's windows, which today overlook the city's central hub, would have looked out on to a sea of masts and rigging. Sugar and tobacco flowed in to Bristol from the Caribbean. Manufactured goods went to Africa and were swapped for slaves for the Caribbean plantations. </p> <p>When the sugar trade ended, the warehouse moved on to tobacco and eventually birdseed, before lying empty for 11 years.

A sweeping modern staircase leads up to the 40 loft-style bedrooms retaining massive wooden beams and iron pillars. </p> <p>The ships may have sailed, but Bristol retains its air of a city wedded to the sea.

      "body": "<p>In his essay on The Advancement of Learning, written nearly 400 years ago, Francis Bacon argued that 'the registering and proposing of doubts has a double use'. Aside from its obvious use in helping us to guard 'against errors', doubts can contribute to broadening an investigation. Issues that 'would have been passed by lightly without intervention,' Bacon noted, end up being 'attentively and carefully observed' precisely because of the intervention of doubts.</p> <p>This second use is very important to bear in mind as we try to assess the critiques of globalisation that have been recently aired in different forms. The importance of these challenges lies, I would argue, not so much in the 'theses' that are presented as simple slogans on posters and placards, but in the 'themes' that they bring forcefully into global discussion. Demonstrations have recently occurred not only at the venues of international financial gatherings (for example, in Seattle where the WTO were to meet), but also, in the form of less organised but intense protests, in different national capitals, all the way from Jakarta and Bangkok to Abidjan and Mexico. These doubts about global economic relations continue to come from different ends of the globe, and there is reason enough to see these doubts about globalisation as a global phenomenon as well. They are, in this sense, 'global doubts' - not just an ad hoc assortment of localised opposition.</p> <p>However, the significance of this phenomenon does not undermine the economic case for global trade and worldwide use of modern technology and finance. Indeed, that case is, I believe, very strong. And nevertheless, these disputations can have a very positive role in broadening our investigation of economic and financial relations in the world and in forcing attention to issues that could have been otherwise neglected. We have to distinguish the distinct issues involved. Opponents of globalisation may see it as a new folly, but it is neither particularly new, nor, in general, a folly. It is largely an intensification of the processes of interaction involving travel, trade, migration and dissemination of knowledge that have shaped the progress of the world over millennia. A more immediate point is that there is extensive evidence that the global economy has actually brought prosperity to many different areas of the globe. The productive and economic contributions of global integration can scarcely be denied.</p> <p>However, we also have to recognise the enormous inequalities that exist across the globe and often within each country, and we have to examine the manifest disparities that give these global doubts the political salience they undoubtedly have. What is needed is not a rejection of the positive role of the market mechanism in generating income and wealth, but the important recognition that the market mechanism has to work in a world of many institutions. We need the power and protection of these institutions, provided by democratic practice, civil and human rights, a free and open media, facilities for basic education and health care, economic safety nets, and of course, provisions for women's freedom and rights - a neglected area which is only now beginning to receive the attention it deserves.</p> <p>Let me give a few quick examples. First, a well-functioning market economy does not obviate the need for democracy and civil and political rights. These rights not only give people more freedom to live the way they would like (without being bossed around), they also allow people to have more voice to demand that their interests not be ignored. The fact that no famine has ever occurred in a democratic country (even in very poor ones) with a free press and regular elections is only one rudimentary illustration of this connection. It is not surprising that the demand for democracy and for civil and political rights became much stronger in East and South East Asia, as the economic crisis of 1997 developed and spread.</p> <p>The protective power of democracy is particularly needed as and when a country is hit by an economic crisis. There is, of course, no basic conflict between economic globalisation and the fostering of democracies. But quite often global capitalist institutions show a distinct preference for orderly autocracies over the adversarial politics of democratic governance and the activist use of human rights. It is not adequate to concede verbally (as many advocates of basic reliance on the market do) that non-market institutions may be important; it is necessary to make sure that these institutions are strong and can supplement the market mechanism appropriately and adequately.</p> <p>To take a second issue, the ability of people to participate in the market economy is enormously influenced by social arrangements for education, health care, microcredit, land reform, and other public policies. Furthermore, the sharing of the benefits of the market economy also depends on social institutions. This applies even to very prosperous countries.</p> <p>Take the deprivation of disadvantaged groups in the United States, for example African Americans. Even though American blacks are typically many times richer, in terms of income per head, than people in the developing world, nevertheless in terms of surviving to mature ages, they tend to fall behind the population of many Third World countries, including substantial parts of China and India. Aside from civic violence, lack of a national medical coverage has a role to play here, and so has the breakdown of inner city education and other social arrangements. The unprecedented economic boom that the American economy has enjoyed has not resolved these problems.</p> <p>Third, there is now overwhelming evidence that women's empowerment through schooling, employment opportunities, etc, have the most far-reaching effects on the lives of all - men, women and children. It reduces child mortality; it cuts down health hazards of adults arising from low birth weight; it increases the range and effectiveness of public debates; and it is more influential than economic growth in moderating fertility rates. We can see its influence in the halving of the fertility rate of Bangladesh in less than two decades, and in the fact that while some districts of India have quite high fertility rates, others with more gender equity already have fertility rates lower than the United States and Britain. The reach of social institutions that work for gender equity is astonishingly large.</p> <p>There is also a related point of great importance which John Kenneth Galbraith has made very forcefully. The role of institutions has to be assessed in terms of the 'countervailing power' they exercise over one another. Asymmetric power in one domain can be checked by a different configuration of forces in another domain. Distribution of power in the world relates closely to institutional plurality. This applies even to the institutional basis of world trade and finance, which includes, among other arrangements, such institutions as the World Trade Organisation, the World Bank, the IMF, and so on. It is necessary to re-examine the balance of power in the running of the different institutions that make up the global architecture.</p> <p>The present institutional architecture was largely set up in the middle Forties, on the basis of the understanding of the needs of the world economy as interpreted in the Bretton Woods Conference held just as the Second World War was coming to an end. The world was, in fact, very different in the Forties, when the bulk of Asia and Africa was still under colonial rule of one kind or another, when the tolerance of insecurity and of poverty was much greater (even the West had just emerged from a massive depression and a very destructive war), and when there was little understanding of the huge global prospects of democracy, economic development and human rights in the world.</p> <p>Even within the existing global architecture, the substantive policies followed by the principal institutions can make a big difference. For example, the recent changes in the policy priorities of the World Bank (under the leadership of James Wolfensohn), with a much greater involvement with economic security and social development, has been undoubtedly influential. The existing institutions can address the global doubts more fully, and the United Nations can also play a very big role in forcing attention on these concerns.</p> <p>It is not at all difficult to reject many of the criticisms of globalisation that have recently been made, and it is right that rejectable points should be repulsed. But there is a basic need to recognise that despite the big contributions that a global economy can undoubtedly make to global prosperity, we also have to confront, at the same time, the far-reaching manifestations of inequality between and within nations. The real debate associated with globalisation is, ultimately, not about the efficiency of markets, nor about the importance of modern technology. The debate, rather, is about inequality of power, for which there is much less tolerance now than in the world that emerged at the end of the Second World War.</p> <p>We cannot, to use Francis Bacon's words, let these broader doubts pass 'lightly without intervention'.

      "bodyText": "In his essay on The Advancement of Learning, written nearly 400 years ago, Francis Bacon argued that 'the registering and proposing of doubts has a double use'. Aside from its obvious use in helping us to guard 'against errors', doubts can contribute to broadening an investigation. Issues that 'would have been passed by lightly without intervention,' Bacon noted, end up being 'attentively and carefully observed' precisely because of the intervention of doubts. This second use is very important to bear in mind as we try to assess the critiques of globalisation that have been recently aired in different forms. The importance of these challenges lies, I would argue, not so much in the 'theses' that are presented as simple slogans on posters and placards, but in the 'themes' that they bring forcefully into global discussion. Demonstrations have recently occurred not only at the venues of international financial gatherings (for example, in Seattle where the WTO were to meet), but also, in the form of less organised but intense protests, in different national capitals, all the way from Jakarta and Bangkok to Abidjan and Mexico. These doubts about global economic relations continue to come from different ends of the globe, and there is reason enough to see these doubts about globalisation as a global phenomenon as well. They are, in this sense, 'global doubts' - not just an ad hoc assortment of localised opposition. However, the significance of this phenomenon does not undermine the economic case for global trade and worldwide use of modern technology and finance. Indeed, that case is, I believe, very strong. And nevertheless, these disputations can have a very positive role in broadening our investigation of economic and financial relations in the world and in forcing attention to issues that could have been otherwise neglected. We have to distinguish the distinct issues involved. Opponents of globalisation may see it as a new folly, but it is neither particularly new, nor, in general, a folly.

Stankovic, J. Stankovic, Bunjevcevic, Kovacevic, Nadj. <br></p> <p><strong>Referee</strong>: J M Garcia Aranda (Spain)<br></p> <p><strong>1 min</strong> Sander Westerveld gets his wish and van der Sar starts in goal for Holland. The Yugoslavs have two players suspended, but goal-machine Milosevic is present and correct. Holland kick off in an orange bowl.<br></p> <p><strong>2</strong> Zenden has a lock on the left side, and Overmars starts on the right where he has looked out of sorts due to the unaccustomed nature of the position.<br></p> <p><strong>4</strong> First test for Bosvelt, chased back by Milosevic. The Dutch right-back looks to have pace to spare. The Dutch move smoothly upfield, and an Overmars dummy opens up a shooting chance for Bergkamp. The Arsenal man strikes a rising drive straight into Mihajlovic's backside.<br></p> <p><strong>8</strong> A humdinger of a battle is developing in midfield, with Davids versus the whole of Yugoslavia. It'll be a surprise if the referee doesn't have to take his name at some point in the game. Yugoslavia are absorbing intense early pressure from the home side, but they haven't conceded yet...<br></p> <p><strong>10</strong> Kluivert is pulled back centre-left, 40 yards out. Zenden floats in a cross aimed at Stam, but Djukic rises to clear. They are looking pretty solid at the back - Holland may need some magic to unlock what has been a very porous defence.<br></p> <p><strong>13</strong> Yugoslavia's turn to attack now, with a free kick from the left touchline. Mihajlovic's delivery swings in an van der Sar judges the flight well to clear. Milosevic was lurking with intent behind the Dutch keeper at the far post, and worryingly for Holland, unmarked.<br></p> <p><strong>17</strong> Mijatovic, played in with a quick square ball from Milosevic, finds himself one-on-one with van der Sar 10 yards out. He picks his spot, but unfortunately for Mijatovic, it's the spot occupied by van der Sar. A great save and Yugoslavia should be one-nil up.<br></p> <p><strong>19</strong> Holland go close, firstly through Bergkamp, played in by Davids' through ball lofted over the top down the centre-left. His curling shot has far-corner written all over it, but the athletic Kralj makes the save and importantly gets distance on his parry, with Kluivert lurking with bad intentions. Overmars plays it in again for Kluivert to head, but his effort arrows over the bar. A breathless few minutes.<br></p> <p><strong>21</strong> Bergkamp seems to be responding to some of the criticism he has received about the quality of his performances in an orange shirt. Again, Davids is the provider, this time a weighted through-ball on the deck. Bergkamp aims for the corner from 20 yards and once more, Kralj is Yugoslavia's saviour.<br></p> <p><strong>22</strong> Davids skips past two challenges and with no Bergkamp available to pass to, has a go himself. His rising drive beats Kralj, but just clears the crossbar. Holland have visibly gone up a gear and Yugoslavia are hanging on.<br></p> <p><strong>24 GOAL! Holland 1 - 0 Yugoslavia</strong> Bergkamp, who seems to be missing chances in front of goal, turn provider, flicking a ball on for Kluivert who needs two touches, one to control it (when it looked beyond him) and the other to poke it past Kralj, well beaten this time. Here we go.<br></p> <p><strong>28</strong> The Dutch, buoyed by the goal, are playing with the ball glued to their feet. Yugoslavia need possession and the Dutch are playing passing triangles around them.<br></p> <p><strong>31</strong> Jugovic is looking at a long afternoon scrapping with Davids. When he looks like he's won a tackle legitimately, the referee blows up for a foul. The free kick, from a central position 50 yards out, is taken quickly and Numan cuts inside from the left and drives a low shot at Kralj's near post, which the keeper does well to hold.<br></p> <p><strong>32</strong> Bergkamp plays a short pass to Overmars in the Yugoslav area. The diminutive winger spins and shoots just over. The crowd want another (Orange) goal.<br></p> <p><strong>35</strong> A corner to Holland, from the left. Their first - surprising when you think of the pressure they've put Yugoslavia under. Bergkamp takes, and Kralj gathers with relief over the penalty spot.<br></p> <p><strong>36</strong> Zenden, who earlier blasted a clearance into Mijatovic's face, this time plants one right on Milosevic's kisser. Magic sponge time.<br></p> <p><strong>37</strong> Komljenovic, a solid defender, looks to be lacking pace. Zenden has skinned him for the third time and if the Barcelona man had a shooting foot, Yugoslavia might consider going home at half time.<br></p> <p><strong>38 GOAL!! Holland 2 - 0 Yugoslavia</strong> They might not come out for the second half anyway. Davids, who had been quiet for a couple of minutes, picks up the ball in the centre circle and surges forward. one look up and a perfect loft ball finds Kluivert's boot 10 yards out. the ball slides under Kralj and the orange masses go berzerk. Looks like there are a lot more goals where that came from...<br></p> <p><strong>43</strong> Again, after scoring Holland are keeping the ball in midfield and stringing together 8, 10 passes. Jaap Stam looks on, bored.<br></p> <p><strong>47</strong> Half time: Holland 2 - 0 Yugoslavia. No bookings - just brilliant football<br></p> <p><strong>Second half</strong></p> <p> <strong>45</strong> A weary-looking Yugoslavia restart the game. It's going to take a miracle for them to get back into this one - they look outclassed in every department.<br></p> <p><strong>47</strong> Holland, on a counter-attack, are breathtaking. Overmars arrows a ball to Zenden in space on the left. He plays it back into Davids in a central position, who plays a one-touch pass to Overmars. The winger pulls the trigger from 20 yards but can only blast the ball over. The Men in Orange look irresistible.<br></p> <p><strong>50</strong> Zenden torments Komljenovic too much and gets a knock on the ankle for his trouble. Free kick from the left.<br></p> <p><strong>51 GOAL!!! Holland 3 - 0 Yugoslavia</strong> The set-piece is floated over and the cross is redelivered from the right. Kluivert (who else?) ghosts in at the near post and <strong>bang!</strong> the ball is in the roof of the net and Holland, barring an act of God, are in the semi-final.<br>#</p> <p><strong>54 GOAL!!!! Holland 4 - 0 Holland</strong> Zenden. On the left. Square ball. Kluivert. 10 yards. Bottom corner. Goal. Brilliant. Nuff said.<br> </p> <p><strong>58</strong> Kluivert takes a knock challenging for a high ball and is clutching his right cheek. Holland win a corner from the left. Kluivert is <strong>substituted</strong> as a precautionary measure, to an amazing ovation. Roy Maakay comes on in his place. Nothing comes of the corner, but no-one is complaining.<br></p> <p><strong>63</strong> Yugoslavia are gamely trying to push forward, but even this team of lost-cause specialists appear overwhelmed against this orange machine. Westerveld is preparing to come on for van de Sar.<br></p> <p><strong>65</strong> Overmars and Bergkamp enjoy the space that Makaay creates with is running off the ball. Bergkamp lays the ball off to Overmars on the right of the Yugoslav area, and the Arsenal man's low shot slips wide of the far post with Kralj a spectator. <strong>Substitute</strong> Westerveld comes on for van der Sar.<br></p> <p><strong>69</strong> Davids fouls Milosevic 25 yards out centre-right. Mihajlovic will fancy this one. The four man wall watch his shot bend over them and sail agonisingly wide of the right-hand upright as Westerveld stood rooted to the spot.<br></p> <p><strong>71</strong> <strong>Substitute</strong> Kovacevic on for Drulovic - Yugoslavia now playing with three forwards. His first touch is a header that Westerveld does well to keep out and even better to catch and smother the ball at Milosevic's feet.<br></p> <p><strong>73</strong> Yugoslavia attack and the ball is spread left. Overmars bundles over Milosevic near the corner flag. The free kick is easily cleared but the ball is played back in to the far post and Cocu, tracking back, keeps his eye on the ball all the way and his mid-air clearance becomes a horror show as his collides with the post with his ribs. After a while and some magic sponge action, he gets gingerly to his feet.<br></p> <p><strong>78 GOAL!!!!! Holland 5 - 0 Yugoslavia</strong> Bergkamp, released down the left, keeps the ball well while his team-mates catch up with the play. Dennis looks up and floats the ball to Marc Overmars, 25 yards out centre-right. He chests it and the volley is a sweet as any you will ever see. Kralj does well to get a hand on it, but the power is too great and if they're not too caned, they'll be dancing in the streets of Amsterdam.<br></p> <p><strong>81</strong> Almost number six as Bergkamp takes a free kick from the left. It's a low curling cross/shot that fools everyone. Kralj conjures a save more by luck than judgement.<br></p> <p><strong>84</strong> They haven't come off the gas at all. Still pressing, looking for number six, Holland are playing increasingly through Bergkamp, who seems to have redefined his role. During this tournament.<br></p> <p><strong>88</strong> Dutch possession during this game has been staggering. They must have had over 65% of the ball. There's never been a six-nil during the European Championships. The Dutch have a few minutes to make history.<br></p> <p><strong>90</strong> Two extra minutes to be played, and that's the first time I've ever heard the fourth official get a cheer.<br></p> <p><strong>91 GOA!!!!!! Holland 6 - 0 Yugoslavia</strong> Cocu, from 25 yards, drills the ball into the foot of the right-hand post. The rebound falls kindly for Marc Overmars, who calmly slots the ball home from the left side of the area past a shell-shocked Kralj.<br></p> <p><strong>92 GOAL!!!!!!! Holland 6 - 1 Yugoslavia</strong> Mijatovic strikes a rising drive past Westerveld onto the crossbar, and Milosevic is there to slot it home from 5 yards. One of the more muted celebrations you're likely to see.<br></p> <p><strong>93</strong> Full time: Holland 6 (Six) - 1 Yugoslavia. Truly, truly amazing.<br></p>",

Yugoslavia need possession and the Dutch are playing passing triangles around them. 31 Jugovic is looking at a long afternoon scrapping with Davids. When he looks like he's won a tackle legitimately, the referee blows up for a foul. The free kick, from a central position 50 yards out, is taken quickly and Numan cuts inside from the left and drives a low shot at Kralj's near post, which the keeper does well to hold. 32 Bergkamp plays a short pass to Overmars in the Yugoslav area. The diminutive winger spins and shoots just over. The crowd want another (Orange) goal. 35 A corner to Holland, from the left. Their first - surprising when you think of the pressure they've put Yugoslavia under. Bergkamp takes, and Kralj gathers with relief over the penalty spot. 36 Zenden, who earlier blasted a clearance into Mijatovic's face, this time plants one right on Milosevic's kisser. Magic sponge time. 37 Komljenovic, a solid defender, looks to be lacking pace. Zenden has skinned him for the third time and if the Barcelona man had a shooting foot, Yugoslavia might consider going home at half time. 38 GOAL!! Holland 2 - 0 Yugoslavia They might not come out for the second half anyway. Davids, who had been quiet for a couple of minutes, picks up the ball in the centre circle and surges forward. one look up and a perfect loft ball finds Kluivert's boot 10 yards out. the ball slides under Kralj and the orange masses go berzerk. Looks like there are a lot more goals where that came from... 43 Again, after scoring Holland are keeping the ball in midfield and stringing together 8, 10 passes. Jaap Stam looks on, bored. 47 Half time: Holland 2 - 0 Yugoslavia. No bookings - just brilliant football Second half 45 A weary-looking Yugoslavia restart the game. It's going to take a miracle for them to get back into this one - they look outclassed in every department. 47 Holland, on a counter-attack, are breathtaking. Overmars arrows a ball to Zenden in space on the left. He plays it back into Davids in a central position, who plays a one-touch pass to Overmars. The winger pulls the trigger from 20 yards but can only blast the ball over. The Men in Orange look irresistible. 50 Zenden torments Komljenovic too much and gets a knock on the ankle for his trouble. Free kick from the left. 51 GOAL!!! Holland 3 - 0 Yugoslavia The set-piece is floated over and the cross is redelivered from the right. Kluivert (who else?) ghosts in at the near post and bang! the ball is in the roof of the net and Holland, barring an act of God, are in the semi-final. # 54 GOAL!!!! Holland 4 - 0 Holland Zenden. On the left. Square ball. Kluivert. 10 yards. Bottom corner. Goal. Brilliant. Nuff said. 58 Kluivert takes a knock challenging for a high ball and is clutching his right cheek. Holland win a corner from the left. Kluivert is substituted as a precautionary measure, to an amazing ovation. Roy Maakay comes on in his place. Nothing comes of the corner, but no-one is complaining. 63 Yugoslavia are gamely trying to push forward, but even this team of lost-cause specialists appear overwhelmed against this orange machine. Westerveld is preparing to come on for van de Sar. 65 Overmars and Bergkamp enjoy the space that Makaay creates with is running off the ball. Bergkamp lays the ball off to Overmars on the right of the Yugoslav area, and the Arsenal man's low shot slips wide of the far post with Kralj a spectator. Substitute Westerveld comes on for van der Sar. 69 Davids fouls Milosevic 25 yards out centre-right. Mihajlovic will fancy this one. The four man wall watch his shot bend over them and sail agonisingly wide of the right-hand upright as Westerveld stood rooted to the spot. 71 Substitute Kovacevic on for Drulovic - Yugoslavia now playing with three forwards. His first touch is a header that Westerveld does well to keep out and even better to catch and smother the ball at Milosevic's feet. 73 Yugoslavia attack and the ball is spread left. Overmars bundles over Milosevic near the corner flag. The free kick is easily cleared but the ball is played back in to the far post and Cocu, tracking back, keeps his eye on the ball all the way and his mid-air clearance becomes a horror show as his collides with the post with his ribs. After a while and some magic sponge action, he gets gingerly to his feet. 78 GOAL!!!!! Holland 5 - 0 Yugoslavia Bergkamp, released down the left, keeps the ball well while his team-mates catch up with the play. Dennis looks up and floats the ball to Marc Overmars, 25 yards out centre-right. He chests it and the volley is a sweet as any you will ever see. Kralj does well to get a hand on it, but the power is too great and if they're not too caned, they'll be dancing in the streets of Amsterdam. 81 Almost number six as Bergkamp takes a free kick from the left. It's a low curling cross/shot that fools everyone. Kralj conjures a save more by luck than judgement. 84 They haven't come off the gas at all. Still pressing, looking for number six, Holland are playing increasingly through Bergkamp, who seems to have redefined his role. During this tournament. 88 Dutch possession during this game has been staggering. They must have had over 65% of the ball. There's never been a six-nil during the European Championships. The Dutch have a few minutes to make history. 90 Two extra minutes to be played, and that's the first time I've ever heard the fourth official get a cheer. 91 GOA!!!!!! Holland 6 - 0 Yugoslavia Cocu, from 25 yards, drills the ball into the foot of the right-hand post. The rebound falls kindly for Marc Overmars, who calmly slots the ball home from the left side of the area past a shell-shocked Kralj. 92 GOAL!!!!!!! Holland 6 - 1 Yugoslavia Mijatovic strikes a rising drive past Westerveld onto the crossbar, and Milosevic is there to slot it home from 5 yards. One of the more muted celebrations you're likely to see. 93 Full time: Holland 6 (Six) - 1 Yugoslavia. Truly, truly amazing.",

      "body": "<p>It's the last thing you need before a hard-earned holiday.You've packed your bags, cancelled the milk, left the key with your neighbours, remembered your passport and sweated in car, bus or train to meet your check-in time at the airport. Only to find that, when you get there, your flight has been delayed and you have hours to kill before take-off. </p> <p>Last weekend holidaymakers across the country found themselves stuck with nowhere to go when a crucial air traffic control computer crashed at the service's West Drayton centre. As temperatures soared, discomfort grew. </p> <p>Delays can be caused by all sorts of things: hurricanes in the Caribbean, strikes in Spain, bomb scares, wars and hijacks. With air traffic increasing by 5 per cent every year, and persistent problems with an overloaded air traffic control network, it is wise to be prepared for more chaos, especially since July and August are busier months than June. </p> <p>Last weekend more than 400 flights in and out of Heathrow were cancelled. The previous week a 20-minute glitch caused 12 flights to be stopped, but the effects were felt for days since crews and planes were in the wrong place. EasyJet cancelled its entire weekend's operation, which suggests it was cheaper to keep its fleet on the ground. Flight cancellations are indiscriminate: it doesn't matter if you are Sir Bobby Charlton travelling to a football match in Belgium or William Hague hoping to attend a meeting in Portugal, you too could be forced to set up temporary home in a departure lounge. Here's how to survive. </p> <p><strong> The airports</strong><br> </p> <p><strong>Heathrow</strong>, at 3,000 acres and 1,250 flights per day, is Europe's largest airport by any criterion, so there will be much more for passengers to do and buy than at other UK airports. In the event of a delay, management may provide extra staff, seating, blankets and water. Children's colouring books are available from information desks at airports run by BAA. </p> <p><strong> Your rights</strong><br> </p> <p> There are three main players in the waiting game (airport, airline and tour operator) and no hard and fast rules. The best advice is to buy <strong> travel insurance </strong> and check that you are covered for delays and cancellations. Another important point to remember is that although you will usually be allowed to <strong> go home</strong> to wait - even after you have checked in - it is your responsibility to catch your flight, and delays can shorten as well as lengthen. </p> <p>But there are guidelines: delays of three hours merit a <strong> food voucher</strong> of \u00a33, and passengers delayed for six hours are entitled to a main meal. If you miss a business meeting or just a day of your holiday, you may be able to claim <strong> compensation</strong>, but it depends on who is responsible for the delay. For example, airlines are are not liable for bad weather delays, but may themselves demand last weekend's losses back from the Civil Aviation Authority. </p> <p>The small print in tour operators' brochures will tell you how far they will go to help you. Air2000 and First Choice, for instance, supply refreshment vouchers for delays of more than three hours and will pay for a meal after a longer delay. They can also arrange and fund overnight B&amp;B accommodation if necessary. </p> <p>Operators who use charter airlines find it difficult to allow customers extra time on holiday since charter flights are booked by the week. However, those who use scheduled airlines may be able to extend their holidays by a day or two. </p> <p>British Airways Holidays' policy is to deal with individual situations as and when they arise (it has a 24-hour duty office for customer enquiries). Last weekend it dealt with 400 passengers, offering the opportunity to cancel their holiday at no cost or making amendments to schedules to fit in with later scheduled flights, but the company did not pay for any overnight accommodation. </p> <p><strong> Things to take</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Families </strong> with very young children should of course take a supply of their necessities, but remember that airports have shops on both sides of the check-in gate selling nappies and baby food. Bring favourite board games, books, a pack of cards or portable computer games. </p> <p><strong> Things to do</strong><br> </p> <p> Passing the time should not be too much of a problem at <strong> Heathrow</strong> . The most important thing to remember is that there is free bus travel within the airport perimeter. Each terminal offers something different, but all are easily accessible by bus, as is the Heathrow visitor centre and the hotels on the main access road. </p> <p><strong> Terminal 1</strong> has a small golf studio with an electronic golf simulator in which golfers can practise their swing (\u00a310 for 15 minutes). Alternatively the <strong> Beauty Centre</strong> offers facials, makeovers, manicures and massages and stocks leading brands. Free makeovers are also available from the <strong> Mac </strong> shop in <strong> Terminal 3</strong> , subject to demand. The<strong> Hilton Hotel</strong> near <strong> Terminal 4 </strong> offers access to its gym, pool and solarium for \u00a310. </p> <p><strong> Arcades</strong> with a wide range of games machines are located in Terminals 2 and 3<strong> </strong> (<strong> Voyager</strong> in Terminal 2 and <strong> Serendipity </strong> and <strong> Sega </strong> in Terminal 3). Under-sevens should head for the large <strong> play area</strong> in the <strong> Flight Connection Centre </strong> (far end of Terminal 1) for climbing frames and soft toys. It is well padded but unsupervised. </p> <p>The <strong> Queen's Building</strong> is located between Terminals 1 and 2 and houses the new <strong> business centre</strong> (open 7am-7pm, Monday to Friday, closed weekends). Unlimited access to the lounge is \u00a320, use of the computers (and the internet) is \u00a34.50 per half hour and there are charges to send faxes or use the photocopier. Call 020 8759 2434 for information. </p> <p>The business centre is in a quiet area of the airport, but for real tranquillity head outside for the multi-denominational <strong> chapel</strong>, near Car park 2. Unremarkable from the exterior, it is rather like entering a gloomy spaceship - the dome-shaped underground room has a roughly textured, grey finish and, despite spotlights, it is fairly dark. However, it is definitely relaxing, and there is usually a chaplain on hand for a chat. On the other side of the <strong> Garden of Remembrance</strong> is a small, bright <strong> prayer room</strong>. The garden is rather misleadingly named, since there are no green spaces at Heathrow. There is a further prayer area for Muslim travellers in Terminal 3. </p> <p>The <strong> Spectators' Viewing Gallery</strong> (020 8745 5259) on the roof of Terminal 2, from which passengers can watch planes take off and land, is also free. A perfect way to kill a few hours is to take a free bus ride to the <strong> Heathrow Visitor Centre (</strong> 020 8745 6655). The facilities include a flight simulator (\u00a31 a go) and interactive displays explaining the airport's history and the roles of its employees. If you fancy joining the workforce there is even a job centre. </p> <p>While facilities at regional airports may not be quite so extensive, many will have other advantages. <strong> Stanley Park </strong> at <strong> Manchester Airport</strong> is popular with both staff and passengers, while the city centre itself is just 20 minutes away by car. The airport also offers a <strong> children's play area</strong>, a <strong> business centre</strong> with internet and fax machines, <strong> beauty salons </strong> and<strong> hairdressers</strong>. In the event of major delays they will supply blankets, colouring books and children's entertainers. </p> <p><strong> Stansted</strong> also has a <strong> play area</strong>, an <strong> internet exchange</strong> and the <strong> Millennium Lounge</strong>, which is open to over-16s from 5.30am to 9.30pm. The entrance charge of \u00a315 covers complimentary drinks from the caf\u00e9 and bar, complimentary newspapers, TV and music stations, and workstations with fax, phones, internet and email. Stansted village itself is just a bus ride away. </p> <p><strong> Things to buy</strong><br> </p> <p> When it comes to shopping, <strong> Heathrow</strong> is in a league of its own - definitely have your credit card at the ready. It is claimed that the profusion of upmarket designer shops (<strong> Gucci, Chanel, Herm\u00e8s</strong> and <strong> Liberty</strong> are all in Terminal 3) is justified by market research into the demographic profile of the Heathrow passenger.

      "bodyText": "It's the last thing you need before a hard-earned holiday.You've packed your bags, cancelled the milk, left the key with your neighbours, remembered your passport and sweated in car, bus or train to meet your check-in time at the airport. Only to find that, when you get there, your flight has been delayed and you have hours to kill before take-off. Last weekend holidaymakers across the country found themselves stuck with nowhere to go when a crucial air traffic control computer crashed at the service's West Drayton centre. As temperatures soared, discomfort grew. Delays can be caused by all sorts of things: hurricanes in the Caribbean, strikes in Spain, bomb scares, wars and hijacks. With air traffic increasing by 5 per cent every year, and persistent problems with an overloaded air traffic control network, it is wise to be prepared for more chaos, especially since July and August are busier months than June. Last weekend more than 400 flights in and out of Heathrow were cancelled. The previous week a 20-minute glitch caused 12 flights to be stopped, but the effects were felt for days since crews and planes were in the wrong place. EasyJet cancelled its entire weekend's operation, which suggests it was cheaper to keep its fleet on the ground. Flight cancellations are indiscriminate: it doesn't matter if you are Sir Bobby Charlton travelling to a football match in Belgium or William Hague hoping to attend a meeting in Portugal, you too could be forced to set up temporary home in a departure lounge. Here's how to survive. The airports Heathrow, at 3,000 acres and 1,250 flights per day, is Europe's largest airport by any criterion, so there will be much more for passengers to do and buy than at other UK airports. In the event of a delay, management may provide extra staff, seating, blankets and water. Children's colouring books are available from information desks at airports run by BAA. Your rights There are three main players in the waiting game (airport, airline and tour operator) and no hard and fast rules. The best advice is to buy travel insurance and check that you are covered for delays and cancellations. Another important point to remember is that although you will usually be allowed to go home to wait - even after you have checked in - it is your responsibility to catch your flight, and delays can shorten as well as lengthen. But there are guidelines: delays of three hours merit a food voucher of \u00a33, and passengers delayed for six hours are entitled to a main meal. If you miss a business meeting or just a day of your holiday, you may be able to claim compensation, but it depends on who is responsible for the delay. For example, airlines are are not liable for bad weather delays, but may themselves demand last weekend's losses back from the Civil Aviation Authority. The small print in tour operators' brochures will tell you how far they will go to help you. Air2000 and First Choice, for instance, supply refreshment vouchers for delays of more than three hours and will pay for a meal after a longer delay. They can also arrange and fund overnight B&amp;B accommodation if necessary. Operators who use charter airlines find it difficult to allow customers extra time on holiday since charter flights are booked by the week. However, those who use scheduled airlines may be able to extend their holidays by a day or two. British Airways Holidays' policy is to deal with individual situations as and when they arise (it has a 24-hour duty office for customer enquiries). Last weekend it dealt with 400 passengers, offering the opportunity to cancel their holiday at no cost or making amendments to schedules to fit in with later scheduled flights, but the company did not pay for any overnight accommodation. Things to take Families with very young children should of course take a supply of their necessities, but remember that airports have shops on both sides of the check-in gate selling nappies and baby food. Bring favourite board games, books, a pack of cards or portable computer games. Things to do Passing the time should not be too much of a problem at Heathrow . The most important thing to remember is that there is free bus travel within the airport perimeter. Each terminal offers something different, but all are easily accessible by bus, as is the Heathrow visitor centre and the hotels on the main access road. Terminal 1 has a small golf studio with an electronic golf simulator in which golfers can practise their swing (\u00a310 for 15 minutes). Alternatively the Beauty Centre offers facials, makeovers, manicures and massages and stocks leading brands. Free makeovers are also available from the Mac shop in Terminal 3 , subject to demand. The Hilton Hotel near Terminal 4 offers access to its gym, pool and solarium for \u00a310. Arcades with a wide range of games machines are located in Terminals 2 and 3 ( Voyager in Terminal 2 and Serendipity and Sega in Terminal 3). Under-sevens should head for the large play area in the Flight Connection Centre (far end of Terminal 1) for climbing frames and soft toys. It is well padded but unsupervised. The Queen's Building is located between Terminals 1 and 2 and houses the new business centre (open 7am-7pm, Monday to Friday, closed weekends). Unlimited access to the lounge is \u00a320, use of the computers (and the internet) is \u00a34.50 per half hour and there are charges to send faxes or use the photocopier. Call 020 8759 2434 for information. The business centre is in a quiet area of the airport, but for real tranquillity head outside for the multi-denominational chapel, near Car park 2. Unremarkable from the exterior, it is rather like entering a gloomy spaceship - the dome-shaped underground room has a roughly textured, grey finish and, despite spotlights, it is fairly dark. However, it is definitely relaxing, and there is usually a chaplain on hand for a chat. On the other side of the Garden of Remembrance is a small, bright prayer room. The garden is rather misleadingly named, since there are no green spaces at Heathrow. There is a further prayer area for Muslim travellers in Terminal 3. The Spectators' Viewing Gallery (020 8745 5259) on the roof of Terminal 2, from which passengers can watch planes take off and land, is also free. A perfect way to kill a few hours is to take a free bus ride to the Heathrow Visitor Centre ( 020 8745 6655). The facilities include a flight simulator (\u00a31 a go) and interactive displays explaining the airport's history and the roles of its employees. If you fancy joining the workforce there is even a job centre. While facilities at regional airports may not be quite so extensive, many will have other advantages. Stanley Park at Manchester Airport is popular with both staff and passengers, while the city centre itself is just 20 minutes away by car. The airport also offers a children's play area, a business centre with internet and fax machines, beauty salons and hairdressers. In the event of major delays they will supply blankets, colouring books and children's entertainers. Stansted also has a play area, an internet exchange and the Millennium Lounge, which is open to over-16s from 5.30am to 9.30pm. The entrance charge of \u00a315 covers complimentary drinks from the caf\u00e9 and bar, complimentary newspapers, TV and music stations, and workstations with fax, phones, internet and email. Stansted village itself is just a bus ride away. Things to buy When it comes to shopping, Heathrow is in a league of its own - definitely have your credit card at the ready. It is claimed that the profusion of upmarket designer shops ( Gucci, Chanel, Herm\u00e8s and Liberty are all in Terminal 3) is justified by market research into the demographic profile of the Heathrow passenger. Whatever the reason, it means that there are plenty of tax-free bargains on the other side of the check-in barrier: Gucci sunglasses can be picked up for \u00a380 to \u00a3100, or you can spend up to \u00a31,000 on a Gucci watch. Many shops will look after purchases until you return from holiday, so if you have a long wait ahead, why not do some Christmas shopping? Another option might be to invest in a Walkman or portable mini-disc player at Dixons (Terminals 1-4), all of which will be cheaper than in the High Street. HMV and WH Smith have a wide range of CDs and mini-discs. But to keep the children really quiet, get your hands on a Gameboy (\u00a350) and the new Pok\u00e9mon game. Try the book shops, where you'll find the latest Harry Potter story, as well as Martin Amis's memoirs. Or send the kids off to the Disney store in Terminal 1. Whiskies of the World stocks 350 different whiskies, some of which can be tasted (another way to pass the time). Prices range from \u00a38 to \u00a33,500 for a 50-year-old Glenfiddich.

Don't forget that if you are travelling outside the European Union you can still shop at duty-free prices. Do not expect a comparable selection of shops at regional airports such as Stansted, Southampton, Edinburgh and Luton. However, all have duty-free shops, newsagents and book shops. Refreshments and amenities Free showers and baby-changing facilities are now available at most airports. Restaurants vary enormously. Egon Ronay produces a guide to eating at BAA airports (including Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted, Southampton, Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen). Heathrow leads the way. Pret \u00e0 Manger in Terminal 1 rates highly, as does Harry Ramsden's (fish and chips, \u00a36) and the Parallel 54 cocktail bar in Terminal 3's Food Village. He declines to rate Burger King, but this is a cost effective option (\u00a34.29 for a meal). Chez Gerard and TGI Fridays have both opened outlets in Terminal 3 recently. Garfunkel's at Gatwick, Bewley's at Southampton, Pizza Hut at Glasgow and Brophy's at Aberdeen also won plaudits, but it is clear that passengers should not arrive with high expectations if they are travelling from a crowded regional airport.

      "body": "<p>Smiles. Smiles are the souvenirs I treasure most from my trip to the small West Indian island of St Lucia. Yes, there was sunshine, sea like blue Champagne and crustaceans in every liqueur known to man, but from the moment the BWIA plane touched down on the surf-fringed airstrip at Hewanorra there began an endless succession of 100-watt, happy smiles, almost all accompanied by a 'Welcome to San Loosha', straight from the heart, that I will never forget. </p> <p>From Hewanorra a half-hour minibus ride wove giddily round the potholes in the roads to my destination: the luxurious Jalousie Hilton on the west coast of the island. Tucked away beneath the dense coconut palms in its own exclusive bay between the island's famous Pitons - two green peaks thrown up by volcanic activity 40,000 years ago - this was like no hotel I had ever seen before. It describes itself as a 'resort and spa', with guests housed in separate villas, and you really do need recourse to a map to find your way around the 300 acres of this former plantation. To aid you in your travels, a discreet fleet of minibuses cruise the lanes invisibly, materialising magically within 30 seconds of a guest's request. </p> <p>This is a destination for the true tropical sybarite. There is so much to do - with four restaurants, three bars, tennis courts, swimming pool, beach, golf course and spa centre - that to reveal one's intention to explore the island beyond the gated perimeter is considered at the very least eccentric. What more could you want, the eyes of the puzzled staff seem to say. But it is essential to get out and about, if only to stop yourself from becoming irreversibly accustomed to private plunge-pools and saronged Bond-girl-alikes (usually honeymooning with some smouldering James) by the gallon. </p> <p>So what do you do? Well, you can drive to the nearby botanical gardens, which boast waterfalls and welcome shade in a climate where the needle barely dips below the 30-degree mark. There you can wander slowly between beds containing several species of spectacular Heliconia whose huge, paddle-shaped leaves shroud strings of bright red bracts which give the shrub its nickname Lobster Claw. Hundreds of hibiscus, oleanders, passion flowers, sky flowers, are all here in abundance, and you can see tiny hummingbirds darting between nutmeg, banana, coconut, breadfruit and mango trees. It's enough to put the more familiar strelitzias to shame. </p> <p>From there it's a short trip to the sulphur springs, worryingly referred to in tourist itineraries as 'Drive-In Volcano'. You can smell these steaming, spluttering springs a mile away, but they do serve as a reminder of the volcanic history of the island as well as providing the locals with food for monumental superstition. Equestrians can opt to ride Western-style on obedient horse through active banana and coconut plantations on the Mourne Coubaril estate, though beware the falling fruit. The more adventurous - it cannot be stressed enough that you must be very fit for this - can go for long guided walks into the rainforest which covers the higher reaches of the mountains in the centre of the island, where peaceful, isolated communities of Rastafarians practise their 'agricul ture'. Again, botanically this is fascinating territory - all banyans and strange epiphytes and secret waterfalls spilling into rock pools visited by large land-crabs - but be sure to carry water and food as the trek is an arduous one, especially in the heat. </p> <p>Gastronomic adventures can also be rewarding, though it was initially on the recommendation of the view at sunset that I ventured to the Dasheene Restaurant at Ladera, a 15-minute drive away in the hills. At precisely 6.30pm the huge burning ball of the sun disappeared beneath the horizon, swallowed up in a sea of impossible pinks and blues. The food that followed was delicious if a little contrived - good fresh raw materials such as local crab and prawn whose flavours were restrained or smothered rather than encouraged. When it came to pudding, however, Ladera's Tropical Fruit Creme Brulee out-bruleed any other brulee I have ever encountered. </p> <p>Bronzed and, despite the brulee, visibly leaner from my extensive amateur forays into an undersea world populated with marine creatures every bit as colourful and exotic as the plant life, it was with a heavy heart that I hung up my air-conditioning remote-control for the last time and headed north for a very different holiday experience in the capital, Castries. This time I travelled by boat, which is a good way to see otherwise inaccessible parts of the coastline and drop in on places such as wealthy Marigot Bay, the location for the first Dr Doolittle film, where numerous stars including Mick Jagger have homes high above the bay. </p> <p>Castries has a ramshackle charm about it. The elegant town square is now called Derek Walcott Square after St Lucia's most famous, Nobel-winning literary son, though its name has changed over the centuries through successive occupations by the British and the French. There you will find vendors selling crafts, basketwork, T-shirts and all manner of local fast foods - dasheene (a relation of the turnip), fried plantain, peas and rice. The surrounding architecture consists largely of late nineteenth and early twentieth-century wooden buildings built in the French style with intricate fretwork balconies overhanging the pavement. Of special interest on this principally Roman Catholic island is thecathedral, with its apse ceiling painting of five saints with St Lucy at the centre. </p> <p>Here I stayed in the altogether more American-style surroundings of the Royal St Lucian hotel on Reduit Beach. A more public affair, most rooms look out on an elaborate swimming pool which snakes under bridges and round bends in a complex of pink sun terraces, culminating in a sunken, 'swim-up' bar at the centre for those who like to enjoy their parasolled planter's punches in a semi-submerged state. The beach itself was brochure-perfect: a long white strand punctuated by pink sails and caressed by soft Caribbean surf at the edge of a warm azure sea. Were it not for the allure of the snorkelling, glass-bottom boats, jetskis, waterskiing et al , it would be easy to pass a week under a thatched umbrella there with a sack of novels for company. </p> <p>What drew me away was the annual St Lucia Jazz Festival. It's really more a case of soul and jazz, in fact, and this year's headliners were Herbie Hancock, Joe Lovano, Joe Sample, Brenda Russell, Spyro Gyra, George Duke and Monty Alexander, supplemented by soul stars Gladys Knight, Lou Rawls and James Ingram. Many of the concerts didn't even begin until midnight, beneath an ivory Caribbean moon, whereas others were staged in the sensuous heat of tropical afternoons on palm-fringed, sandy beaches. </p> <p>Billed as being 'to jazz what Jamaica's Sunsplash is to reggae', St Lucia Jazz 2000 took place at venues around the island, though the biggest gigs were held at Pigeon Island, just north of Castries. In the capital itself, Cameroonian jazz singer and bass-player Richard Bona's intimate set at the Half Yellow Moon club provided the high-point of the entire festival, and back in Derek Walcott Square local singer Mervyn Wilkinson and venerable St Lucian calypsonian Ronald 'Boo' Hinkson entertained enthusiastic crowds with their own homegrown musical delights. </p> <p>As the curtain fell on my stay in St Lucia Land of Smiles, I realised I had quickly learned to dance to the music of a different drum. Be it in the guise of jazz pilgrim, shambolic amateur naturalist or just five-star sybarite, I will return. </p> <p><strong>St Lucia spas</strong></p> <p><strong>Jalousie Hilton</strong> </p> <p>Not being particularly au fait with these things I opted to go for the Caribbean Massage. This turned out to be a standard massage carried by a Caribbean person and very good it was, too. It lasted approximately 55 minutes and cost US$75. An enjoyable treatment using lavender oil, it certainly relaxed tired muscles and eased tension. I emerged feeling revitalised if pleasantly drowsy. </p> <p><strong>Royal St Lucian</strong> </p> <p>I've never been keen on cutting my nails, so seeing manicure and pedicure on the menu I went for that, at US$50. True, you do feel mildly guilty as someone else clips and digs and files away, but then they bathe your feet and hands in magical balms and you just want more. As a bloke, I'm not sure about the shiny transparent nail-varnish, though...</p>",

Tucked away beneath the dense coconut palms in its own exclusive bay between the island's famous Pitons - two green peaks thrown up by volcanic activity 40,000 years ago - this was like no hotel I had ever seen before. It describes itself as a 'resort and spa', with guests housed in separate villas, and you really do need recourse to a map to find your way around the 300 acres of this former plantation. To aid you in your travels, a discreet fleet of minibuses cruise the lanes invisibly, materialising magically within 30 seconds of a guest's request. This is a destination for the true tropical sybarite. There is so much to do - with four restaurants, three bars, tennis courts, swimming pool, beach, golf course and spa centre - that to reveal one's intention to explore the island beyond the gated perimeter is considered at the very least eccentric. What more could you want, the eyes of the puzzled staff seem to say. But it is essential to get out and about, if only to stop yourself from becoming irreversibly accustomed to private plunge-pools and saronged Bond-girl-alikes (usually honeymooning with some smouldering James) by the gallon. So what do you do? Well, you can drive to the nearby botanical gardens, which boast waterfalls and welcome shade in a climate where the needle barely dips below the 30-degree mark. There you can wander slowly between beds containing several species of spectacular Heliconia whose huge, paddle-shaped leaves shroud strings of bright red bracts which give the shrub its nickname Lobster Claw. Hundreds of hibiscus, oleanders, passion flowers, sky flowers, are all here in abundance, and you can see tiny hummingbirds darting between nutmeg, banana, coconut, breadfruit and mango trees. It's enough to put the more familiar strelitzias to shame. From there it's a short trip to the sulphur springs, worryingly referred to in tourist itineraries as 'Drive-In Volcano'. You can smell these steaming, spluttering springs a mile away, but they do serve as a reminder of the volcanic history of the island as well as providing the locals with food for monumental superstition. Equestrians can opt to ride Western-style on obedient horse through active banana and coconut plantations on the Mourne Coubaril estate, though beware the falling fruit. The more adventurous - it cannot be stressed enough that you must be very fit for this - can go for long guided walks into the rainforest which covers the higher reaches of the mountains in the centre of the island, where peaceful, isolated communities of Rastafarians practise their 'agricul ture'. Again, botanically this is fascinating territory - all banyans and strange epiphytes and secret waterfalls spilling into rock pools visited by large land-crabs - but be sure to carry water and food as the trek is an arduous one, especially in the heat. Gastronomic adventures can also be rewarding, though it was initially on the recommendation of the view at sunset that I ventured to the Dasheene Restaurant at Ladera, a 15-minute drive away in the hills. At precisely 6.30pm the huge burning ball of the sun disappeared beneath the horizon, swallowed up in a sea of impossible pinks and blues. The food that followed was delicious if a little contrived - good fresh raw materials such as local crab and prawn whose flavours were restrained or smothered rather than encouraged. When it came to pudding, however, Ladera's Tropical Fruit Creme Brulee out-bruleed any other brulee I have ever encountered. Bronzed and, despite the brulee, visibly leaner from my extensive amateur forays into an undersea world populated with marine creatures every bit as colourful and exotic as the plant life, it was with a heavy heart that I hung up my air-conditioning remote-control for the last time and headed north for a very different holiday experience in the capital, Castries. This time I travelled by boat, which is a good way to see otherwise inaccessible parts of the coastline and drop in on places such as wealthy Marigot Bay, the location for the first Dr Doolittle film, where numerous stars including Mick Jagger have homes high above the bay. Castries has a ramshackle charm about it. The elegant town square is now called Derek Walcott Square after St Lucia's most famous, Nobel-winning literary son, though its name has changed over the centuries through successive occupations by the British and the French. There you will find vendors selling crafts, basketwork, T-shirts and all manner of local fast foods - dasheene (a relation of the turnip), fried plantain, peas and rice. The surrounding architecture consists largely of late nineteenth and early twentieth-century wooden buildings built in the French style with intricate fretwork balconies overhanging the pavement. Of special interest on this principally Roman Catholic island is thecathedral, with its apse ceiling painting of five saints with St Lucy at the centre. Here I stayed in the altogether more American-style surroundings of the Royal St Lucian hotel on Reduit Beach. A more public affair, most rooms look out on an elaborate swimming pool which snakes under bridges and round bends in a complex of pink sun terraces, culminating in a sunken, 'swim-up' bar at the centre for those who like to enjoy their parasolled planter's punches in a semi-submerged state. The beach itself was brochure-perfect: a long white strand punctuated by pink sails and caressed by soft Caribbean surf at the edge of a warm azure sea. Were it not for the allure of the snorkelling, glass-bottom boats, jetskis, waterskiing et al , it would be easy to pass a week under a thatched umbrella there with a sack of novels for company. What drew me away was the annual St Lucia Jazz Festival. It's really more a case of soul and jazz, in fact, and this year's headliners were Herbie Hancock, Joe Lovano, Joe Sample, Brenda Russell, Spyro Gyra, George Duke and Monty Alexander, supplemented by soul stars Gladys Knight, Lou Rawls and James Ingram. Many of the concerts didn't even begin until midnight, beneath an ivory Caribbean moon, whereas others were staged in the sensuous heat of tropical afternoons on palm-fringed, sandy beaches. Billed as being 'to jazz what Jamaica's Sunsplash is to reggae', St Lucia Jazz 2000 took place at venues around the island, though the biggest gigs were held at Pigeon Island, just north of Castries. In the capital itself, Cameroonian jazz singer and bass-player Richard Bona's intimate set at the Half Yellow Moon club provided the high-point of the entire festival, and back in Derek Walcott Square local singer Mervyn Wilkinson and venerable St Lucian calypsonian Ronald 'Boo' Hinkson entertained enthusiastic crowds with their own homegrown musical delights. As the curtain fell on my stay in St Lucia Land of Smiles, I realised I had quickly learned to dance to the music of a different drum. Be it in the guise of jazz pilgrim, shambolic amateur naturalist or just five-star sybarite, I will return. St Lucia spas Jalousie Hilton Not being particularly au fait with these things I opted to go for the Caribbean Massage. This turned out to be a standard massage carried by a Caribbean person and very good it was, too. It lasted approximately 55 minutes and cost US$75. An enjoyable treatment using lavender oil, it certainly relaxed tired muscles and eased tension. I emerged feeling revitalised if pleasantly drowsy. Royal St Lucian I've never been keen on cutting my nails, so seeing manicure and pedicure on the menu I went for that, at US$50. True, you do feel mildly guilty as someone else clips and digs and files away, but then they bathe your feet and hands in magical balms and you just want more. As a bloke, I'm not sure about the shiny transparent nail-varnish, though...",

      "body": "<p>The first thing I did on arrival at Birmingham's New Street station was pay a visit to W.H. Smith's for a pocket book containing locomotive numbers. I couldn't find one. 'Excuse me, do you still sell those little trainspotting books?' I asked the assistant. </p> <p>'I don't think we sell that type of thing any more,' she said, looking at this 35-year-old man as if I'd just asked for the latest copy of Nuns In Rubber. 'I'll ask my manager.' </p> <p>'DAVE, DO WE HAVE ANY OF THOSE TRAINSPOTTING BOOKS LEFT?' she shouted from one end of the shop to the other. The bustle stopped and dozens of pairs of eyes bored into me with a mixture of vilification and pity. I looked around for my friend, Tom, who had driven me to the station. He had dropped behind a counter and become engrossed in a magazine for the concrete industry. As a boy, I had been a trainspotter. Now that innocent noun had carved a place for itself as a pejorative and lay somewhere between paedophile and rapist in the nation's collective conscience. I left the shop quickly. Without my book. </p> <p>A quarter of a century earlier, the station was the focal point of my troubled life. Back then, in the space of 12 months, cancer hollowed out my beloved grandmother, my grandfather died, and my uncle James, who'd had such an influence on me, suffered a fatal stroke. On the way back from James's funeral, my father announced he was leaving my mother. Shortly afterwards, my mother was diagnosed with cancer. Not a particularly good time. I was fat, lonely and miserable, and witnessing an ordered life crumble into chaos and dust. </p> <p>Every Saturday I would buy a platform ticket and just sit, watching. I fell in love - with the noise, the diesel fumes, the possibility of travel, of getting away, putting distance between myself and a life that had become unfamiliar and full of conflict. Somebody else's life. Somebody else's script. </p> <p>I saved my pocket money and progressed from platform tickets to tickets to travel. I would pitch up at the ticket office at New Street, empty my pockets and ask how far my money would take me. Often, it was just to Wolverhampton or Stafford, but sometimes I'd get as far as Crewe or Doncaster, with their bustling locomotive works and engine sheds - spotting paradises. </p> <p>In the summer, I'd purchase a railrover ticket, which gave me unlimited travel for a week. Sometimes I'd be gone for two or three days at a time. I could nearly always end the evening on a train travelling overnight and get some sleep but, on more than one occasion, I had to get my head down in the warm embrace of a waiting room. I had become obsessed. </p> <p>My parents worried, but they had other things to occupy them. It felt good to get away. To be sitting on a train. Going somewhere, anywhere, as long as it wasn't home, where people shouted and cried and said wild, dangerous things. </p> <p>One summer's weekend in 1975, aged 11, I undertook a trainspotter's pilgrimage. I headed north to Crewe, home of Crewe Works, one of the largest locomotive works in the world, occupying 365 acres. From Crewe, across the Pennines to Doncaster, to the fabled 'Donny' Works, where generations of trainbuilders had turned out legendary engines. From Doncaster to Darlington, and then on to Shildon, the location then of one of Europe's biggest wagon-building plants but, more importantly, the venue for The Railway Cavalcade, a celebration of 150 years of railways. Shildon was not chosen lightly for the honour of hosting this festival. It was outside the Mason's Arms pub in the town that the first public passenger train departed in 1825 for Stockton on the Stockton and Darlington Railway. </p> <p>On that Sunday, I sat and watched a procession of trains go by: Stephenson's Rocket, the Flying Scotsman, Mallard, Great Western Castles and Southern Region Bullied Pacifics; a pantheon of steam locomotives. Also on display were contemporary British-built locos, still setting the standard the world over. It was a sublime day, embracing the past, and looking optimistically to the future. </p> <p>During the following 25 years, my love of trains never diminished, although when I discovered beer and girls the attraction of sitting on a freezing platform lost its allure. Now, curious to see what had happened in the time I'd been away, I under took that same journey. From Birmingham, I headed north on a Virgin train, through the tunnel that leads away from New Street. It felt good to be travelling on a train again, not commuting or on business, but just for the sake of it. Ahead was a cartoon mousehole of bright light, and the infinite possibilities that travel brings. </p> <p>I found the guard and asked him what working on the modern railways was like. I told him I was writing a piece for The Observer. He stiffened, and told me that he had signed a contract forbidding him from talking to the press. I'd be arrested if Virgin found out what I was doing. He scuttled off, leaving me feeling a little seditious. </p> <p>The approach to Crewe used to be memorable for spotters. The four tracks fanned out into a vast marshalling yard. There was Crewe Diesel Depot, where you were guaranteed to see dozens and dozens of locomotives. </p> <p>It was raining when I got to Crewe this time. The marshalling yard had shrunk considerably and in it were columns of vandalised and neglected coaches. At the diesel depot, a dozen locos stood idle. Half of them had broken windscreens or had their side panels ripped off to reveal missing engines - emasculated giants. It was a depressing sight. I stood on the platform in a flurry of wind and water, the overhead cables fizzing and humming. This trip had seemed a good idea at the time, but I was beginning to have regrets. When I used to come to Crewe, I felt part of it. Now, I felt like an outsider. The trains looked like Portakabins on wheels. Each train carried a different livery; a private affair. The staff, in their Virgin Puffa jackets, looked like they'd be more at home serving fries and Whoppers. </p> <p>The next day I headed for the site of the old British Rail Crewe Works. In 1837 the first station was opened by the Grand Junction Railway Company, but it was not until 1843, when the GJRC decided to site its workshops at Crewe, that the town was born. At its height, the works employed 30,000 people and made some of the finest trains the world has seen. The ubiquitous HSTs that ply their trade all over the country were made at Crewe. During the last 20 years, the works has been run down and what little remained was sold to the private sector. Adtranz, the company which took over, employs around 1,000 people, largely engaged in collision repair or refurbishment. No locomotives are made. </p> <p>Part of the old works is occupied by a huge Safeway store. In the car park there is a steam tank engine, painted in the supermarket's corporate colours and surrounded by rubber matting for children to play on. </p> <p>Almost hidden behind Safeway is the Railway Age, a small heritage centre to celebrate 150 years of the railways in Crewe. It would be easy to miss. On one of the sidings is the prototype of the Advanced Passenger Train. During the late Eighties, the APT tilting train was developed at Crewe, at enormous cost to the taxpayer, to achieve greater speeds on the twisting line to Glasgow. Early trials were successful, but there were problems with the tilting mechanism and it was abandoned by a government with no vested interest in the future of trainbuilding. In 2002, Richard Branson's new Pendolino tilting trains will enter service on the West Coast Main Line and run past the rusting museum piece at the Heritage Centre. Virgin has invested \u00a3592 million in these trains. The tilting mechanisms are being built by Fiat in Italy, the bogies in Switzerland, and they are being assembled in the old Metro Cammell Works in Birmingham by Alstom, a French company. </p> <p>I left Crewe heading for Doncaster in a box painted yellow with green sploshes. The seats were made of thin foam and all passengers faced the same way. Just like when you go back to your old school and find the seats and desks ludicrously small, so it is with these local trains. The interior was finished in a dull, utilitarian grey and, with sliding electric doors and no openable windows, the train was like a hermetically sealed tube. It was so quiet and smooth that even the clickety-clack of the wheels on the tracks was annulled. </p> <p>While changing trains at Sheffield, I talked to one of the men in the uniform of Midland Mainline. He used to work at the vast Tinsley marshalling yard, just outside the Steel City. Now he stands on the station all day 'meeting and greeting, smiling at customers and being as helpful as possible'. 'I am known as a customer services supervisor,' he continued, forcing a grin. 'I can't even go for a piss without some 23-year-old graduate manager asking me where I've been.' </p> <p>Another customer services operative told me that, when trains run late, it can quickly descend into chaos. 'The different companies' timetables do not connect with each other like they used to,' he said. 'It just becomes a free-for-all, and we are here to apologise for it all.' </p> <p>At Doncaster, I saw my first trainspotters. I approached, telling them what I was up to. They recoiled, becoming defensive. The media had been brutal towards 'railway enthusiasts', they said, correcting my terminology, and they had no desire to provide further ammunition. </p> <p>One of my abiding memories of spotting was sitting at Doncaster Station, listening for the shrill sound of the twin Napier engines of a Deltic. Silently, more than 100 tons of metal would creep into view and then erupt furiously in a maelstrom of full-open throttles and crashing coaches, the entire station shaking to its foundations. Seconds later, all that was left was the wind and a red tail light, disappearing bewitchingly into the night. It was magnificent. </p> <p>Later that night I paid a visit to Doncaster Works. Up until the mid-Eighties, more than 5,000 men were employed there. The last locomotive to be built there, a Class 58, rolled off the production line in 1987. Now there are around 300 men employed there, based in a tiny part of the old site, mostly on contracts to refurbish wagon wheels and respray coaches. </p> <p>I stood outside the gates that had teemed with life on my last visit. Opposite was the plant public house, now boarded up. I spoke to one of the security guards, patrolling the desolate site. </p> <p>'It's such a bloody waste,' he said. 'I started here as a crane operator in 1985. There were more than 5,000 here then. I was asked: \"How old are you?\" I told him I was 26. He replied: \"You'll still be working here when you're 65.\" Two years later, the plant was effectively closed down and I've been working as a security guard ever since. I earn \u00a33.60 an hour, working a 75-hour week to survive.' </p> <p>That night, in my B&amp;B, I read an article about the 270 Class 66 locomotives that have been ordered, to be operated on British freight workings, by English, Welsh &amp; Scottish Railways, now the sole mover of freight in Britain, Freightliner excepted. The supplier of this massive order? General Motors of Ontario. I also read about the fleet of 30 new Class 67 locomotives. The supplier? Alstom at Valencia, Spain, as sub-contractors for General Motors. It seemed the nation that invented the train was now importing them by the depot load. From Doncaster to York, the home of The National Railway Museum, and until recently, the site of York Railway Works, closed down in 1995. Finally on to Darlington, where I waited for the train to Shildon, the place where the railways began and my journey would end. I waited. And waited. And waited. </p> <p>After 30 minutes, a station official appeared in an ankle-length greatcoat and military cap. The train had failed. It wasn't coming. No train was coming. One of the features of train operators having to lease rolling stock is that when they break down there is no replacement. It does not make economic sense. </p> <p>And so it was that I turned up in Shildon, the birthplace of trains, in a minicab. It was howling a gale and the sky was firing a horizontal salvo of frozen bullets. The last time I was in Shildon, at the great Cavalcade, the works employed 3,000 people. The interim history carried a depressingly familiar leitmotif . In 1982, BREL, announced that it intended to close the 150-year-old works, then still one of the most profitable in the country. </p> <p>Despite petitions from Sedgefield Borough Council, the closure went ahead. Unemployment in the town shot up to nearly 50 per cent, and 355 people were chasing every job vacancy in the area. Businesses folded, shops closed and the value of property plummeted. An entire generation moved away to seek work and never returned. </p> <p>Schools closed, crime soared and the social and health implications of such disastrous levels of unemployment began to bite savagely. Today Shildon, where it is possible to buy a house for \u00a36,000, is showing signs of a slow recovery. </p> <p>But if you popped into The Mason's Arms and asked the locals about The Closure, you would still generate emotions of bitter and visceral intensity. In the unrelenting rain, I went to stand at the spot where I watched the trains go by all those years ago. The sidings had been ripped up, and only weeds flourished. I had seen enough and was regretting coming back. I wanted to go home. </p> <p>At Doncaster, waiting for the train to London, I saw a lad taking numbers and photographs at the end of the platform. I approached him and said hello, difficult enough when you are 35, grubby from four days of travelling, and the recipient of your attentions is a schoolboy. His name was Michael, he was 14, and he came from Liverpool. </p> <p>I asked him why he went trainspotting. He replied that he liked the power, the speed and the noise. He asked me if I liked writing. I couldn't answer him. I asked him about his photography. He talked about the dusting of snow on the Pennines that morning, and how marvellously the winter sun reflected off it. A dusting. Reflecting winter sun. He was 14! </p> <p>We talked about trains. Michael told me he loved the old Class 47s, but hates the new Class 66s. 'They're so boring,' he said. I told him how I used to love the old Class 40s, and hated the then new 47s. 'They were so characterless,' I said. We agreed to differ. </p> <p>After a while, I told Michael how my spotting began when things at home had started to go wrong. He told me he had started spotting three years previously, just about the time his parents had split up. </p> <p>My train pulled in and I climbed on board. I stood at the door to wave him off. I was tired and jaded and unshaven. His nascent eyes were full of the future; sparkling and beaming. He wished me luck. I said: 'Good luck to you, too.'</p>",

The tilting mechanisms are being built by Fiat in Italy, the bogies in Switzerland, and they are being assembled in the old Metro Cammell Works in Birmingham by Alstom, a French company. I left Crewe heading for Doncaster in a box painted yellow with green sploshes. The seats were made of thin foam and all passengers faced the same way. Just like when you go back to your old school and find the seats and desks ludicrously small, so it is with these local trains. The interior was finished in a dull, utilitarian grey and, with sliding electric doors and no openable windows, the train was like a hermetically sealed tube. It was so quiet and smooth that even the clickety-clack of the wheels on the tracks was annulled. While changing trains at Sheffield, I talked to one of the men in the uniform of Midland Mainline. He used to work at the vast Tinsley marshalling yard, just outside the Steel City. Now he stands on the station all day 'meeting and greeting, smiling at customers and being as helpful as possible'. 'I am known as a customer services supervisor,' he continued, forcing a grin. 'I can't even go for a piss without some 23-year-old graduate manager asking me where I've been.' Another customer services operative told me that, when trains run late, it can quickly descend into chaos. 'The different companies' timetables do not connect with each other like they used to,' he said. 'It just becomes a free-for-all, and we are here to apologise for it all.' At Doncaster, I saw my first trainspotters. I approached, telling them what I was up to. They recoiled, becoming defensive. The media had been brutal towards 'railway enthusiasts', they said, correcting my terminology, and they had no desire to provide further ammunition. One of my abiding memories of spotting was sitting at Doncaster Station, listening for the shrill sound of the twin Napier engines of a Deltic. Silently, more than 100 tons of metal would creep into view and then erupt furiously in a maelstrom of full-open throttles and crashing coaches, the entire station shaking to its foundations. Seconds later, all that was left was the wind and a red tail light, disappearing bewitchingly into the night. It was magnificent. Later that night I paid a visit to Doncaster Works. Up until the mid-Eighties, more than 5,000 men were employed there. The last locomotive to be built there, a Class 58, rolled off the production line in 1987. Now there are around 300 men employed there, based in a tiny part of the old site, mostly on contracts to refurbish wagon wheels and respray coaches. I stood outside the gates that had teemed with life on my last visit. Opposite was the plant public house, now boarded up. I spoke to one of the security guards, patrolling the desolate site. 'It's such a bloody waste,' he said. 'I started here as a crane operator in 1985. There were more than 5,000 here then. I was asked: \"How old are you?\" I told him I was 26. He replied: \"You'll still be working here when you're 65.\" Two years later, the plant was effectively closed down and I've been working as a security guard ever since. I earn \u00a33.60 an hour, working a 75-hour week to survive.' That night, in my B&amp;B, I read an article about the 270 Class 66 locomotives that have been ordered, to be operated on British freight workings, by English, Welsh &amp; Scottish Railways, now the sole mover of freight in Britain, Freightliner excepted. The supplier of this massive order? General Motors of Ontario. I also read about the fleet of 30 new Class 67 locomotives. The supplier? Alstom at Valencia, Spain, as sub-contractors for General Motors. It seemed the nation that invented the train was now importing them by the depot load. From Doncaster to York, the home of The National Railway Museum, and until recently, the site of York Railway Works, closed down in 1995. Finally on to Darlington, where I waited for the train to Shildon, the place where the railways began and my journey would end. I waited. And waited. And waited. After 30 minutes, a station official appeared in an ankle-length greatcoat and military cap. The train had failed. It wasn't coming. No train was coming. One of the features of train operators having to lease rolling stock is that when they break down there is no replacement. It does not make economic sense. And so it was that I turned up in Shildon, the birthplace of trains, in a minicab. It was howling a gale and the sky was firing a horizontal salvo of frozen bullets. The last time I was in Shildon, at the great Cavalcade, the works employed 3,000 people. The interim history carried a depressingly familiar leitmotif . In 1982, BREL, announced that it intended to close the 150-year-old works, then still one of the most profitable in the country. Despite petitions from Sedgefield Borough Council, the closure went ahead. Unemployment in the town shot up to nearly 50 per cent, and 355 people were chasing every job vacancy in the area. Businesses folded, shops closed and the value of property plummeted. An entire generation moved away to seek work and never returned. Schools closed, crime soared and the social and health implications of such disastrous levels of unemployment began to bite savagely. Today Shildon, where it is possible to buy a house for \u00a36,000, is showing signs of a slow recovery. But if you popped into The Mason's Arms and asked the locals about The Closure, you would still generate emotions of bitter and visceral intensity. In the unrelenting rain, I went to stand at the spot where I watched the trains go by all those years ago. The sidings had been ripped up, and only weeds flourished. I had seen enough and was regretting coming back. I wanted to go home. At Doncaster, waiting for the train to London, I saw a lad taking numbers and photographs at the end of the platform. I approached him and said hello, difficult enough when you are 35, grubby from four days of travelling, and the recipient of your attentions is a schoolboy. His name was Michael, he was 14, and he came from Liverpool. I asked him why he went trainspotting. He replied that he liked the power, the speed and the noise. He asked me if I liked writing. I couldn't answer him. I asked him about his photography. He talked about the dusting of snow on the Pennines that morning, and how marvellously the winter sun reflected off it. A dusting. Reflecting winter sun. He was 14! We talked about trains. Michael told me he loved the old Class 47s, but hates the new Class 66s. 'They're so boring,' he said. I told him how I used to love the old Class 40s, and hated the then new 47s. 'They were so characterless,' I said. We agreed to differ. After a while, I told Michael how my spotting began when things at home had started to go wrong. He told me he had started spotting three years previously, just about the time his parents had split up. My train pulled in and I climbed on board. I stood at the door to wave him off. I was tired and jaded and unshaven. His nascent eyes were full of the future; sparkling and beaming. He wished me luck. I said: 'Good luck to you, too.'",

      "body": "<p>From the moment Mary Pierce whacked a winner past Conchita Martinez at Roland Garros, you somehow knew the French were in for a good summer. Even a gruesome Johnny Halliday special performance in front of the Eiffel Tower could not dampen the idea that while Cool Britannia is as hip as a Shackleton recliner, La Belle France is definitely frache. </p> <p>Add to this the spectacle of Euro 2000, where the combined talents of the Arsenal squad - sorry, French national team - dazzled the opposition, and Arsene Wenger pronounced them 'five years ahead in footballing terms of England' (we wish!), and the pile of deals ignited by French companies and it makes you queasier than a bad channel crossing. </p> <p>France is playing a corporate blinder, too. Vivendi, under the ambitious Jean-Marie Messier, took over Seagram and became the world's second-largest media company. France T\u00e9l\u00e9com bought Orange - though it could be interpreted as a reverse takeover, so high were the premiums for retaining the Orange management. Then there is Publicis buying the proudest name in British advertising, Saatchi and Saatchi, and yogurt maker extraordinaire Danone, with its cheeky bid for Nabisco. </p> <p>Looking for a common thread to tie Thierry Henry to a fruit pur\u00e9e manufacturer may appear a spurious exercise. But the success of these French team enterprises has a common foundation: training. And in particular relevance to its corporate success, state involvement. </p> <p>Ten days ago hundreds of thousands of French 18-year-olds were struggling through a Baccalaureate, which included questions such as 'Can the demands of justice be reconciled with the demands of liberty?' Imagine laying such a pearl before the massed ranks of Blunkett's underachievers. The very idea of grappling with a philosophical notion is anathema to benchmarking, yet fits well with the vocational aspects of a broader curriculum. Put that in your beacon school and smoke it, as they say. </p> <p>The fact that Messier came through the country's egalitarian education system and graduated from the Ecole Polytechnique, is also significant. The rather turgid emphasis the French have on state-funded comprehensive education is reaping the same results as its attention to young footballers. They don't, of course, have lovely photos of a dappled prince in an Eton cloister to put in their newspapers, so they borrow ours. But it seems a small price to pay for excellence in sport and commerce. </p> <p>There are, of course, other factors in their corporate success - such as the way the French government shamelessly protected its previously nationalised industries, such as the utilities which comprise half of Vivendi, but far from bloating into unwieldy bureaucracies, their sleeping giants are dynamic worldbeaters oddly able to compete in the free market. </p> <p>So while the French desire to involve the state in education and corporate life is curiously repugnant to our own Thatcherite free market thinking, we cannot deny that it is hugely effective. </p> <p>To watch French television you would not believe that many products are sold in France which are not mobile phones; their adoration of the prototype French internet, Minitel, has been replaced by a wholehearted embracing of the world wide web.

      "bodyText": "From the moment Mary Pierce whacked a winner past Conchita Martinez at Roland Garros, you somehow knew the French were in for a good summer. Even a gruesome Johnny Halliday special performance in front of the Eiffel Tower could not dampen the idea that while Cool Britannia is as hip as a Shackleton recliner, La Belle France is definitely frache. Add to this the spectacle of Euro 2000, where the combined talents of the Arsenal squad - sorry, French national team - dazzled the opposition, and Arsene Wenger pronounced them 'five years ahead in footballing terms of England' (we wish!), and the pile of deals ignited by French companies and it makes you queasier than a bad channel crossing. France is playing a corporate blinder, too. Vivendi, under the ambitious Jean-Marie Messier, took over Seagram and became the world's second-largest media company. France T\u00e9l\u00e9com bought Orange - though it could be interpreted as a reverse takeover, so high were the premiums for retaining the Orange management. Then there is Publicis buying the proudest name in British advertising, Saatchi and Saatchi, and yogurt maker extraordinaire Danone, with its cheeky bid for Nabisco. Looking for a common thread to tie Thierry Henry to a fruit pur\u00e9e manufacturer may appear a spurious exercise. But the success of these French team enterprises has a common foundation: training. And in particular relevance to its corporate success, state involvement. Ten days ago hundreds of thousands of French 18-year-olds were struggling through a Baccalaureate, which included questions such as 'Can the demands of justice be reconciled with the demands of liberty?' Imagine laying such a pearl before the massed ranks of Blunkett's underachievers. The very idea of grappling with a philosophical notion is anathema to benchmarking, yet fits well with the vocational aspects of a broader curriculum. Put that in your beacon school and smoke it, as they say. The fact that Messier came through the country's egalitarian education system and graduated from the Ecole Polytechnique, is also significant. The rather turgid emphasis the French have on state-funded comprehensive education is reaping the same results as its attention to young footballers. They don't, of course, have lovely photos of a dappled prince in an Eton cloister to put in their newspapers, so they borrow ours. But it seems a small price to pay for excellence in sport and commerce. There are, of course, other factors in their corporate success - such as the way the French government shamelessly protected its previously nationalised industries, such as the utilities which comprise half of Vivendi, but far from bloating into unwieldy bureaucracies, their sleeping giants are dynamic worldbeaters oddly able to compete in the free market. So while the French desire to involve the state in education and corporate life is curiously repugnant to our own Thatcherite free market thinking, we cannot deny that it is hugely effective. To watch French television you would not believe that many products are sold in France which are not mobile phones; their adoration of the prototype French internet, Minitel, has been replaced by a wholehearted embracing of the world wide web. The towering business parks in the outskirts of Antibes are as impressive as anything in California. There is nothing backward about the French attitude to business or international development. Of course one takes with this what other commentators have correctly identified as a chauvinistic tendency - but then beating the world is one sure-fire way to resist it. We could, it seems, learn a lot from the French, in football and in business. But for anyone who listened to the highlights of the Halliday concert there is a crumb of comfort - their music is still bloody awful. emily.bell@observer.co.uk",

There was an ocean perch or 'redfish', bug-eyed and Day-Glo orange - too ugly for the skittish British, but beloved of Germans. There was a handsome, yard-long coley, shaded grey like a salmon, and a flat, spiky skate, hard-blinking its recessed eyes in a way which I found inexplicably moving. But my eye was drawn to one of the cod, a big one, four feet in length and perhaps the same in years. The other fish were lying still, but this one wasn't. It was struggling, flicking its powerful tail and refusing to give up. In repose, it was beautiful - dark at the spine, with a delicate silver thread running down its side amid dancing amber-green specks. I realised with amazement that I'd never seen a live one before, only steaks and fillets. </p> <p>We recognise the cod as ubiquitous, yet few of us know just how entwined we are with it. In the Middle Ages, the revelation that its salted flesh would keep over time and distance shrank the world of our forbears as profoundly as the invention of the aeroplane, television and the internet have our own. It became a strategic resource and for three centuries the fortunes of Atlantic nations and the world they rampaged across and subjugated were shaped by it. </p> <p>In fact, the longer you look at this ranging, roving determined survivor, the more you come to see it as one of nature's chosen species, a talisman to whom our future is linked as assuredly as our past. For scientists are now coming to see that, quite apart from being a valuable food source, the cod is one of the most sensitive barometers we have as to the health of the planet. It is entirely possible that if it goes, we go too. And for reasons we don't fully understand, it's going. Fast. On the morning I left for Iceland, the Today programme on Radio 4 reported that this year's British catch was shaping up to be 'the worst in living memory' and I can still hear announcer James Naughtie's voice in my head as the big cod on the deck, summoning one last effort, flips itself up towards a gap in the ship's outer rail, but falls agonisingly short of its target. It crashes back down, defeated and finally accepting of its fate, before sliding passively into the hold and destiny on a supermarket shelf. 'And scientists are saying that it's not going to get any better,' Naughtie had said. 'In fact, it may get worse.' That was one of the lucky ones, then. </p> <p>In 1989, the United Nations estimated the combined cost of subsidising the world's fishing fleet at $92 billion. In the early 90s, the European Union was spending an annual $580 million. This can't go on. Iceland is said to be the only nation left on earth whose fishing industry is expected to make a significant contribution to the national economy. It guards its waters and fish stocks jealously, yet even here there are problems. As my plane touches down, a fierce row is erupting over a proposed reduction in quotas for next year, where an increase had been anticipated. This is not the only surprise that will be greeting me this week. </p> <p>The Westman Islands jut monumentally out of the sea off the southern coast of Iceland. The Vikings named them after the Irishmen (the west men) who they enslaved and deposited there. Since then, they have been sacked by Turks and terrorised by the live volcano which last erupted in the 1970s. Living here has long been something of a balancing act. </p> <p>The midsummer sun was shining benignly when I arrived at around midnight on a Sunday, but I was worried. The day before, I'd gone fly fishing on a bleak and windy Icelandic lake with some local fish merchants and a couple of English buyers who happened to be visiting at the same time. People here follow weather forecasts with an avidity that we don't at home and everyone knew that storms were predicted for the next couple of days. I kept being asked the same question - 'Have you been out before?' - to which I would mumble, 'Oh, you know, ferries and things...' and watch as the questioner's eyes ignited with amusement. Even the girl sitting next to me on the 25-minute flight did it. Sleep was elusive that night. </p> <p>The sun was still shining early the next morning, but as I set about locating my boat in the remarkably pretty, cliff-framed harbour, the sky clouded over and a fine drizzle began. Anyone who's seen The Omen will remember something similar happening when one of the priests gets trapped in a park with Satan; and I fully expected to hear a thunderclap in the distance as I shook the hand of Helgi, my initially laconic captain. I braced myself for the inevitable question, which duly came in the course of the following exchange. </p> <p>'Have you been out before?' </p> <p>'Well, you know, sort of. Ferries. And things.' </p> <p>'Then you will be sick, I think.' </p> <p>Which was at least direct. It seemed to be getting colder and windier all the time. One of the Englishman I'd met on the lake, Keith Brown of the Grimsby-based Sealord company, later informed me that a fish-factory owner he was with glanced out to sea that day and confidently predicted that we would not be sailing in such conditions. Worse, my ship, the Danski P\u00e9tur , turned out to be one of the smallest in the harbour; 27 metres long, 150 tonnes, its decks crowded with nets, chains, booms and rusty, lethal-looking machinery. In the North Atlantic regions, fishermen have the highest fatality rate of any type of worker. A few years ago, one of the crew on this boat had his arm ripped off at the shoulder. I drop off my bags and repair to a safe caf\u00e9 while the crew ready the boat. </p> <p>I am reading a remarkable book called Cod: A Biography of the Fish that Changed the World, by an American writer named Mark Kurlansky. He tells the story of the letter a group of Bristol merchants wrote to Christopher Columbus, as he basked in his 'discovery' of America, reminding him that they'd already been there. And the Frenchman Jacques Cartier, who claimed Newfoundland for France, untroubled by the presence of 1,000 Basque fishing boats anchored there. Like the Bristolians, the Basques hadn't wanted to give away the whereabouts of the secret fishing grounds which had made them rich. Both the Bretons and the English had tried to follow them, but had failed. According to Kurlansky, Sir Walter Raleigh averred in 1595 that if the 50 Newfoundland cod-fishing ships based in Plymouth should ever be lost, 'It would be the greatest blow ever given to England.' </p> <p>Cod also made possible the American Revolution, allowing the New England colon- ies to become prosperous and independent. Cod swim with their mouths wide open and will swallow anything that is put in front of them. Once hooked, they refuse to fight, merely trailing obediently to the surface. To the early fishermen, they must have seemed like gifts from the gods and only in the 1890s did this gift come to seem anything other than boundless, as the invention of the steam engine and trawling led to the near-depletion of North Sea stocks within a decade. The first British-built, steel-hulled trawlers arrived in Icelandic waters in 1905 and some experts contend that they, too, would have been laid waste but for the intervention of the First World War. </p> <p>After the Second World War, on-board freezer technology and high-powered diesel engines capable of dragging huge nets along the sea floor meant that nowhere was safe. The resultant overfishing has been an issue in all areas of the North Atlantic ever since and the cause of two 'Cod Wars' between Britain and Iceland. As it turns out this may be the least of our problems. </p> <p>The Danski P\u00e9tur is almost bizarrely cramped. The bridge is crowded with instruments, the steps to the tiny mess are steep and difficult to squeeze down, and the cabins confront you like dank, dark coffins. To get to my own bunk, I have to stumble through the area where tonnes of freshly caught fish are gutted and sent on a conveyor belt to the hold. Everything smells strongly of blood, sweat and diesel, including the quilt on my own tiny bunk at the front of the ship. I'm contemplating the fact that this will be my home for the next four or five days when a sudden lurch knocks me from my feet. Somewhere just above my head, there is a roar, swiftly followed by a crash and a deathly hiss, as ocean fizzes across the deck, simultaneously sweeping away any constructive use for my stomach over the next 24 hours. </p> <p>I climb to the bridge as fast as my leaden, unsteady legs will take me. We've left the harbour and met a wall of churning, foamy white sea. The boat is shuddering and tilting laterally through at least 110 degrees, while the bow is flung into the air by a succession of irregular waves, then dropped into almost vertical dives. Surf ploughs almost to the base of the bridge: to step outside would be suicide. There is nowhere to escape to, no fresh air to breathe, nothing to do but try to contain my growing queasiness. It feels as though tennis-ball-sized bearings in my skull and abdomen are being manipulated from the outside by a powerful magnet. </p> <p>At the helm, Helgi smiles ruefully, perhaps sensing my increasingly strained attempt to hide my discomfort. 'This is a difficult boat to work,' he says, 'too much roll.' It was built in 1971, but rebuilt in 1988, when a new deck and bigger bridge were added. As a consequence, it is top-heavy and vulnerable to even a modest swell. He wouldn't be worried unless the waves hit 15ft, though, which is about twice what they are right now. And the southwesterly winds will help us travel more quickly to our destination. For the first time it strikes me: for all our technological advancement, this is still what you have to do if you want to catch fish. Later, I will see this as something to celebrate, but such generosity of spirit escapes me at present. </p> <p>I'm in a bind now. I'd bought a supply of seasickness pills in the harbour, but, not wanting to cheat on an experience whose full horror I then had no way of comprehending, I'd decided not to take them. Now I want to - badly! - but every time I take one, it comes straight back up. I go to my cabin with the aim of retreating into slumber while the ocean bombs the hull not feet from my head and I am being alternately pitched into the wall and the rail of my bunk. A couple of times, I wake from dreams of staring into a precipice to find myself rolling across an almost vertical mattress. Only afterwards do I appreciate just how bad the night is. </p> <p>The worst thing is the affront to dignity, the feeling of being a helpless child again in the company of eight capable grown-ups: something no man likes to feel unless it's part of a service he's purchased with Luncheon Vouchers. And like a child, I am assuming that the way things are is the way they will remain. </p> <p>They don't. Most of Tuesday is spent travelling, with the sea gradually easing and my guts beginning to function again. I'm in the mess with the crew, chatting and watching videos of Eddie Murphy films I've never heard of, when I become aware that the roll of the P\u00e9tur has subsided to a gentle sway. Helgi's voice comes over the Tannoy and the men smile at each other wearily. It's 11 in the evening, we've travelled 200 miles north to the sandbanks off the Western Fjords and we're going to drop the net. </p> <p>The water is utterly still, shrouded in mist, dotted with gulls. With the help of a pair of strong hydraulic booms fore and aft, two netmen feed the long net down a recess at the back of the boat. Once it's out, the pair of computer-controlled 'trawl doors', which look like massive cast-iron shields, are dropped in order to maintain an optimum spread and angle of trawl. In the bridge, Helgi is examining a range of sonar equipment. He has detected a high degree of movement underneath us and thinks it might be cod pursuing krill. Now he will move slowly back and forth along the bank for two or three hours, monitoring the net closely; because at 36 fathoms, these are shallow, treacherous waters, haunted by dozens of jagged wrecks - \u00a315,000 worth of net can easily snag, tear and be lost, even by a vigilant captain. </p> <p>The contrast with what has gone before could scarcely be more profound. Today, we're gliding across a pool of shimmering black satin, watching silver-blue reflections of cloud and sky flicker playfully across its surface. As we near the edge of the banks, huge swells rise and fall like liquid Brecon valleys, tossing and softly catching the boat as it falls. Standing at the front, Leonardo DiCaprio-like, I understand the elderly Monet's predilection for painting water for the first time. I am also sorely tempted to echo DiCaprio's 'king of the world' cry from Titanic but think better of it. They might still carry planks on these things. </p> <p>We'd dropped the nets twice before, but that was when we were further south and the weather was bad, so we hadn't caught much. This time, the sensors in Helgi's net tell him that we're getting lucky. He summons the crew, who smile and laugh as they reel in a net containing 8-10 tonnes of fish, most of it cod. The seemingly endless haul is emptied on to a section of deck in stages, then passed into the processing area down below. There, it will be gutted and packed into crates of ice. Often, these men come out and catch nothing, so this is a cause for celebration and everyone seems to relax. </p> <p>The gutting must be done immediately, so while Helgi conducts another trawl, the men begin what is for them a laborious process. I've decided to pitch in and am surprised to find myself instantly possessed by the ghost of Charlie Chaplin. Johann the cook demonstrates how to cut into the fleshly bridge between the gills, then slit the belly, grab the innards and cleanly sever the tendon which holds them in place. I am tutored in removing the liver, placing it in one chute while flinging the guts down another, and introducing the carcass to a slow-moving conveyor belt. </p> <p>He makes it look easy and graceful and I'm doing OK, I think, until Hilmar, the first mate, comes to work opposite me, at which point I go to pieces and my new crewmates find themselves dodging knives and flying fish remains in previously unimaginable quantities. This could explain why, every now and then, a splash of bloody, fishy water hits the back of my head as someone hurls a big beast into the tank that feeds the conveying machine. </p> <p>The worst bit, though, is taking off the orange plastic mac worn during this process and having a little dribble of stinking gunk run down your neck. As so often in life, the splashes are easy to deal with, it's the trickles that mess you up. I decide that I know enough about gutting for the time being. </p> <p>Fourteen hours of intense labour later, we have a hold containing 30 tonnes of fish. Helgi is quietly satisfied: it's been a good day, made better by the fact that an old mate who's skippering a nearby trawler twice the size of this one has only bagged six tonnes. Helgi used to run a boat like that and shows me a picture of the old one in a registry of Icelandic fishing boats; 'the one that got away' of fishing legend. </p> <p>But like most fishermen, he and his crew work for a share of the catch, with the first 25 per cent deducted by the owner for costs and the crew taking 35 per cent of what remains, distributed in increments based on seniority. </p> <p>The Danski P\u00e9tur is compact and powerful, with a small crew to share the profits: Helgi makes better money now than he did then. They also get to keep the livers, which are worth \u00a325 per kilo and will pay for a group holiday (with wives) to Rio in October. These guys do all right. </p> <p>Helgi's been at sea for 35 years, since he was 12. There are far fewer fish now, he tells me, and he must use all his accumulated wiles to catch them. The Westman Isles boats are gradually disappearing, at a rate of one or two every year. 'When I get to 50,' he tells me, 'I would like to give it up and find something else.' It's the gambler's oath. He has no idea of what he might do instead and would have trouble settling into the routine of most jobs after riding the unpredictable seas for so long. His son, Agust, is on the boat, and a son-in-law, Johann, makes an articulate, able chief engineer. </p> <p>In other waters, such a man might dream of owning his own boat, but a boat is worth nothing without 'quota' - a licence to catch an agreed amount of fish per year - and this is expensive and mostly acquired through inheritance or politicking. In the words of Johann the engineer, 'If you want to impress a girl for a date, you don't show her your nice car, you tell her you've got a quota.' It's a kind of feudal system, where fishing families of many generations have no automatic right to fish. </p> <p>The Icelandic quota system, which is similar to the one operated by the EU, was introduced as a crisis measure. Fishermen don't like it. The man from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) in the UK explains some of the problems in working any system that involves fishing, which boil down to the fact that there are many different types in many different areas and everyone wants the restrictions they all agree are necessary to apply somewhere else. These are the original not-in-my-backyarders and it is easy to find yourself listening to one tell you that there are still plenty of fish - the problem is the seismic soundings of oil companies, which scare the creatures away and disrupt their spawning habits. </p> <p>Either way, the so-called 'box' around Ireland was closed completely for three months this spring and the Grand Banks off Newfoundland, once home to the richest cod stocks on earth, have just been reopened after a hiatus of four years. Scientists agree that overfishing has been a major factor in bringing this about. More chilling, though, is the report recently produced by MAFF researchers which claims that cod are failing to reproduce in the North Sea because water temperatures are rising. During the 90s, they say, average temperatures rose from 7.75 C to 8 C, which is in line with man-made global warming. If this theory is correct, the Atlantic cod is trying to tell us something and we don't seem to be listening. </p> <p>I'll be honest with you: I was relieved to get back into port and dry land, though I was sorry to say goodbye to Helgi and his men, who would get an afternoon off, prior to heading out to sea again the next day. A week later, I still think of them every time I can't finish my tea because my stomach's shrunk or someone moves away from me on the Tube because I smell of cod intestine. </p> <p>One of the remedies for overfishing favoured by Mark Kurlansky is to restrict numbers of days at sea rather than size of catch per vessel, which would favour small boats over behemoths with high overheads. This seems a good idea, but Porgrimur Leifsson, the owner of the sparkling fish factory where the P\u00e9tur 's cod will be processed for Waitrose, doesn't think it will happen. 'In a few years, there will be no more boats like the Danski P\u00e9tur ,' he tells me as he drives me away in search of a warm shower and the sanctuary of another life back on terra firma. I think there's a trace of regret in his voice, but it's probably just my imagination.</p>",

I am also sorely tempted to echo DiCaprio's 'king of the world' cry from Titanic but think better of it. They might still carry planks on these things. We'd dropped the nets twice before, but that was when we were further south and the weather was bad, so we hadn't caught much. This time, the sensors in Helgi's net tell him that we're getting lucky. He summons the crew, who smile and laugh as they reel in a net containing 8-10 tonnes of fish, most of it cod. The seemingly endless haul is emptied on to a section of deck in stages, then passed into the processing area down below. There, it will be gutted and packed into crates of ice. Often, these men come out and catch nothing, so this is a cause for celebration and everyone seems to relax. The gutting must be done immediately, so while Helgi conducts another trawl, the men begin what is for them a laborious process. I've decided to pitch in and am surprised to find myself instantly possessed by the ghost of Charlie Chaplin. Johann the cook demonstrates how to cut into the fleshly bridge between the gills, then slit the belly, grab the innards and cleanly sever the tendon which holds them in place. I am tutored in removing the liver, placing it in one chute while flinging the guts down another, and introducing the carcass to a slow-moving conveyor belt. He makes it look easy and graceful and I'm doing OK, I think, until Hilmar, the first mate, comes to work opposite me, at which point I go to pieces and my new crewmates find themselves dodging knives and flying fish remains in previously unimaginable quantities. This could explain why, every now and then, a splash of bloody, fishy water hits the back of my head as someone hurls a big beast into the tank that feeds the conveying machine. The worst bit, though, is taking off the orange plastic mac worn during this process and having a little dribble of stinking gunk run down your neck. As so often in life, the splashes are easy to deal with, it's the trickles that mess you up. I decide that I know enough about gutting for the time being. Fourteen hours of intense labour later, we have a hold containing 30 tonnes of fish. Helgi is quietly satisfied: it's been a good day, made better by the fact that an old mate who's skippering a nearby trawler twice the size of this one has only bagged six tonnes. Helgi used to run a boat like that and shows me a picture of the old one in a registry of Icelandic fishing boats; 'the one that got away' of fishing legend. But like most fishermen, he and his crew work for a share of the catch, with the first 25 per cent deducted by the owner for costs and the crew taking 35 per cent of what remains, distributed in increments based on seniority. The Danski P\u00e9tur is compact and powerful, with a small crew to share the profits: Helgi makes better money now than he did then. They also get to keep the livers, which are worth \u00a325 per kilo and will pay for a group holiday (with wives) to Rio in October. These guys do all right. Helgi's been at sea for 35 years, since he was 12. There are far fewer fish now, he tells me, and he must use all his accumulated wiles to catch them. The Westman Isles boats are gradually disappearing, at a rate of one or two every year. 'When I get to 50,' he tells me, 'I would like to give it up and find something else.' It's the gambler's oath. He has no idea of what he might do instead and would have trouble settling into the routine of most jobs after riding the unpredictable seas for so long. His son, Agust, is on the boat, and a son-in-law, Johann, makes an articulate, able chief engineer. In other waters, such a man might dream of owning his own boat, but a boat is worth nothing without 'quota' - a licence to catch an agreed amount of fish per year - and this is expensive and mostly acquired through inheritance or politicking. In the words of Johann the engineer, 'If you want to impress a girl for a date, you don't show her your nice car, you tell her you've got a quota.' It's a kind of feudal system, where fishing families of many generations have no automatic right to fish. The Icelandic quota system, which is similar to the one operated by the EU, was introduced as a crisis measure. Fishermen don't like it. The man from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) in the UK explains some of the problems in working any system that involves fishing, which boil down to the fact that there are many different types in many different areas and everyone wants the restrictions they all agree are necessary to apply somewhere else. These are the original not-in-my-backyarders and it is easy to find yourself listening to one tell you that there are still plenty of fish - the problem is the seismic soundings of oil companies, which scare the creatures away and disrupt their spawning habits. Either way, the so-called 'box' around Ireland was closed completely for three months this spring and the Grand Banks off Newfoundland, once home to the richest cod stocks on earth, have just been reopened after a hiatus of four years. Scientists agree that overfishing has been a major factor in bringing this about. More chilling, though, is the report recently produced by MAFF researchers which claims that cod are failing to reproduce in the North Sea because water temperatures are rising. During the 90s, they say, average temperatures rose from 7.75 C to 8 C, which is in line with man-made global warming. If this theory is correct, the Atlantic cod is trying to tell us something and we don't seem to be listening. I'll be honest with you: I was relieved to get back into port and dry land, though I was sorry to say goodbye to Helgi and his men, who would get an afternoon off, prior to heading out to sea again the next day. A week later, I still think of them every time I can't finish my tea because my stomach's shrunk or someone moves away from me on the Tube because I smell of cod intestine. One of the remedies for overfishing favoured by Mark Kurlansky is to restrict numbers of days at sea rather than size of catch per vessel, which would favour small boats over behemoths with high overheads. This seems a good idea, but Porgrimur Leifsson, the owner of the sparkling fish factory where the P\u00e9tur 's cod will be processed for Waitrose, doesn't think it will happen. 'In a few years, there will be no more boats like the Danski P\u00e9tur ,' he tells me as he drives me away in search of a warm shower and the sanctuary of another life back on terra firma. I think there's a trace of regret in his voice, but it's probably just my imagination.",

The book is not dead, long live the book, etc. But, frankly, it depends on the book.

Harry Potter and the Doom Spell Tournament is less a book than a phenomenon. A marketing phenomenon. Haven't Bloomsbury sold enough copies of J.K. Rowlings's three volumes so far without resorting to advance hype worthy of a Wonderbra? Have they no faith in their product's ability to sell on its merits? </p> <p>Anticipation has been carefully heightened by shrouding the plot in secrecy, beyond the tantalising titbit that one of the characters dies.

After publication a private train will carry her around the country (a privilege once accorded that other noted author, Edward Heath) to sign copies. Come on, guys, why not just sell it as a book rather than hype it like a Spice Girls CD? </p> <p>Maybe, in truth, because it isn't a very good one. I brave the wrath of millions by daring to say so, but it really doesn't take a high-minded killjoy to worry what these books are doing to the literary taste of millions of potential young readers. Bloomsbury's stock value has trebled since Potter joined its list.

As a workout for the brain, reading (or being read) Harry Potter is an activity marginally less testing than watching Neighbour s. And that, at least, is vaguely about real life. These are one-dimensional children's books, Disney cartoons written in words, no more. </p> <p>It is an interesting paradox that the more popular (or bestselling) an adult book, viz a Barbara Cartland or Jeffrey Archer, the less likely it is to be considered literature, while the popularity of a children's book sees big literary claims being made on its behalf.

I duly found myself amazed. </p> <p>Eager to see what all the fuss was about, I had looked forward to enjoying a magical ride through some thrillingly original fantasy world, on a par with such children's classics as Alice in Wonderland, Treasure Island or Peter Pan, which gently question the values of the adult world from a child's point of view. Instead I found myself struggling to finish a tedious, clunkily written version of Billy Bunter on broomsticks. </p> <p>Several of the Whitbread judges agreed with me. Compared with Jacqueline Wilson's The Illustrated Mum , a slice of real contemporary life which credits its young readers with some interest in the complex world around them, the Potter saga was essentially patronising, very conservative, highly derivative, dispiritingly nostalgic for a bygone Britain which only ever existed at Greyfriars and St Trinian's.

All our antennae were thus alerted to another potential marketing coup for Harry Potter. But it wasn't that which moved me to a protest that made unlikely headlines the next day. It was astonishment that anyone could even begin to hold Rowling's work in the same regard as Heaney's or Cairns's. I was not prepared to lend my name to such faux-naif folly, and said so. All populist hell broke loose. </p> <p>At my most embattled (but before I was called a 'pompous prat' on television), I was alarmed to hear two of the celebrity judges, Jerry Hall and Imogen Stubbs, testifying how much their chil dren enjoyed being read Potter. Were their children, I snorted, to be allowed to choose the Book of the Year? 'You should be reading them Beowulf,' I snapped testily. 'It's much the same sort of stuff, heroes taking on dragons and all that, but the language is far more exciting.' To their credit, Hall and Stubbs politely agreed with me, promised to read their children Heaney, and wound up helping him carry the day. Just. </p> <p>By that weekend the nation seemed to be suffering a collective nervous breakdown, as the Sunday papers debated whether we are a Beowulf Britain or a Harry Potter Britain. We are, of course, neither. We are a country with dramatically declining standards of literacy, increasingly dragged down to the lowest common denominator by the purveyors of all forms of mindless mass entertainment. The success of the Potter books is just another dispiriting proof of the Murdoch-led dumbing down of all our lives, or what Hensher called 'the infantilisation of adult culture'. </p> <p>Having gritted my teeth and struggled through the first two before passing sentence, I remain dumbstruck at their huge popularity. The first three books have sold 21 million copies in the US and a further seven million in Britain and the English speaking-world. </p> <p>Good luck, say I, to Joanne Rowling, who with the help of the marketing men has made a fortune already estimated at \u00a315 million, expected to double once Steven Spielberg makes the movies. I warm to the modest way in which she appears to have handled her huge success, sensibly keeping as low a public profile as possible. </p> <p>She has also, apparently, been persuaded to endure the indignity of hiding behind her initials to spare young male readers the embarrassment of enjoying a book by a woman. And it is not, I suspect, her fault that the Potter mythology misrepresents a middle-class, university-educated writer who chose to leave her Portuguese husband as an abandoned working-class mother toiling away in a Scottish garret. </p> <p>What I do object to is a pedestrian, ungrammatical prose style which has left me with a headache and a sense of a wasted opportunity. If Rowling is blessed with this magic gift of tapping into young minds, I can only wish she had made better use of it. Her characters, unlike life's, are all black-and-white . Her story-lines are predictable, the suspense minimal, the sentimentality cloying every page. (Did Harry, like so many child-heroes before him, HAVE to be yet another poignant orphan?) </p> <p>Even more depressing is the feeble cop-out of this resourceful single parent mum, on welfare while writing the first book, in sending her oh so generic, Molesworthian hero to a good old private English boarding school. Why on earth couldn't Hogwarts (the name is indicative of the reach of her imagination) have been a comprehensive, or an embattled secondary modern or a solid old-fashioned grammar - a school of the kind with which most of those millions of young readers can identify? </p> <p>Why, in the weariest tradition of English children's literature from Tom Brown's Schooldays on, did she have to send Harry to a neo-Dotheboys Hall, complete with such arcane rituals as weirdly named hierarchies and home grown sports with incomprehensible rules? Much of the Potter saga could have been written in the Fifties, as Suzanne Moore has pointed out: 'What child do you know these days who eats rock cakes and talks about galoshes? No wonder they love it in the States.' Ye olde fairy-tale England, with real Tudor beams and a Queen who rides around in a horse-drawn golden coach: that is not just how the rest of the world still sees us, it is how Potterites would have us see ourselves. </p> <p>These are some of the reasons why I said, during and after the Whitbread judging, that a victory for Harry Potter 'would have sent out a signal to the world, like the monarchy and the Dome, that Britain is a country that refuses to grow up and take itself seriously'. I did not, as reported, further argue that children's books cannot be great literature. Of course they can, if they are well-written, stretch the reader's imagination and open virgin minds to the magical powers of words. </p> <p>For all the long shadows of its various villains, the world of Harry Potter is essentially a familiar and thus safe one for young readers to roam in. Their thrill at the smell of danger is carefully controlled by the certainty that virtue will prevail - no Roald Dahl-type risks for Rowling - and their minds unstretched by any reflective pauses in the breathless narrative, any encouragement to assess the rights and wrongs of what is going on. </p> <p>Not that Potter's world offers much scope to moral philosophers. Harry's dead parents were uncomplicatedly good. His wicked uncle and aunt are unequivocally bad, like the super-villain Lord Voldemort. Given their unadorned prose style, these books wind up reading themselves. They are not teaching children the joys of literature any more than they are challenging them to question the supposed certainties of their daily lives. </p> <p>Children's literature is what it is: the invention of a captivating alternative world in which, at its best, home truths about adult behaviour are glimpsed through the eyes of innocence. Harry Potter offers no such transcendent adventure. He is a children's hero for our culturally impoverished times, rating escapism above enlightenment. </p> <p>I wish I could hope that Rowling's new volume will prove me wrong, that she has taken her audience captive only to lift them, at the midpoint of her saga, from the banal realms in which they are rooted to a wonderworld where their souls can soar. On the evidence so far, that seems highly unlikely. As Harry approaches puberty - the series is scheduled to cover seven teenage years - he will no doubt turn into a spotty little wizard who eventually gets the girl. </p> <p>As for the 150,000 adults who paid extra to buy the same books in grown-up dustjackets, to avoid embarrassment when reading them in public (or perhaps even at home), well, get a life. I commend unto you the words of George Walden: 'The Harry Potter books are what they are: tales for children. Unlike Alice in Wonderland , or Just William , or The Simpsons , which can be enjoyed by all ages because they are so finely written and work on so many levels, the Harry Potter books work on just one.' </p> <p>Volume One begins with the sentence: 'Mr and Mrs Dursley of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much.' Any adult who is not stopped in their tracks by that cutesy 'thank you very much', is presumably a Beano subscriber clutching a comfort blanket. Getting in touch with your inner child is all very well, but reluctance to put away childish things is, as another bestseller long ago suggested, rather more worrisome. One can only pray that, having grown up with Harry Potter, his millions of young fans don't spend the rest of their lives stuck in a scary timewarp. There is, as a grown-up writer once put it, a world elsewhere.</p>",

The nation's high streets will be mobbed by parents and children stampeding to obtain not the latest faddish toy or computer game or movie spin-off merchandise, but a book. You know, one of those old-fashioned things, pre-audiobooks and e-novels, with lots of words printed on crisp white pages snugly bound between hard covers. In any other circumstances, this would be cause for stunned rejoicing. The book is not dead, long live the book, etc. But, frankly, it depends on the book. If people were fighting to buy Seamus Heaney's sizzling translation of Beowulf, or David Cairns's riproaring biography of Berlioz, or even my own action-packed life of Shakespeare, I would naturally be uncorking champagne and running jaunty standards up the nation's literary flagpoles. But it's not. Harry Potter and the Doom Spell Tournament is less a book than a phenomenon. A marketing phenomenon. Haven't Bloomsbury sold enough copies of J.K. Rowlings's three volumes so far without resorting to advance hype worthy of a Wonderbra? Have they no faith in their product's ability to sell on its merits? Anticipation has been carefully heightened by shrouding the plot in secrecy, beyond the tantalising titbit that one of the characters dies. No review copies have been sent out.

One of a number of excellent German Rieslings at the Co-op, this is a stylish, intense, almost exotic Mosel Riesling with notes of apple and white peach. The sweetness, refreshing acidity and delicate alcohol are beautifully balanced. </p> <p><strong> 1999 Penfolds Eden Valley Reserve Riesling </strong> (\u00a39.99, selected branches of Safeway). Fuller bodied than the Mosel Riesling, but this cool-climate Eden Valley white from the ever-reliable Penfolds is still delicate by Australian standards. It is zesty and concentrated on the palate, with intense lemon-and-lime fruit and super length. </p> <p><strong> 1999 Tesco Beaujolais Villages, Louis Josse </strong> (\u00a34.99, Tesco).

      "body": "<p>The nearest I get to killing anything is pouring salt on the slugs that regularly turn my garden into the final scene from Peter Greenaway's A Zed and Two Noughts. Even then I use the best Maldon. Cooking mussels doesn't count, as it seems such a blissful way to go: you are piled into a pot with your mates, all pissed on Chardonnay and scattered with herbs. Within seconds of closing the lid someone turns up the fire and you're gone. I can kill mussels without flinching - when I lift the lid and that heady steam billows up, all the shells are gaping at me, as if they died laughing. </p> <p>The rest of the killing I leave to the professionals. Like most consumers, I am happy to tuck into fish or meat, but I want no blood on my hands, thank you. Many will argue that I do, and of course they have a point; but if I am a crab that has to die, I would rather go at the hands of someone who knows what they are doing than someone who dangles me over the boiling brine then wimps out. </p> <p>Last week, I ate lobster at a friend's house. It was the finest lobster I have ever eaten, tasting smack-bang of the sea, its flesh as tender as a Chiver's jelly. Of course, we were a scallop's throw from the sea, in Suffolk. I should disclose here that I have never been a lobster fan, filing it 'under-overrated' - along with white asparagus and fillet steak. Once the snow-white flesh has been drowned in the usual brandy and cream glop so beloved of classic French cooking, then you might as well eat be eating school rubbers. But this was the lobster that made me re-open the file. </p> <p>My host had chosen a different route. She served them naked, hot from the pot, with thin, home-made chips and buckets of wobbling mayonnaise. Explicit instructions were extracted from the cook in that casual, disinterested way in which a professional hacker might get you to divulge your password. I was ready for the kill. </p> <p>So I am standing in the Saturday-morning queue at the fishmongers and waiting till I get to the window that runs the length of the ice-strewn counter. There is no sign of my prey. Scallops shiver in their shells, oysters are firmly closed and obviously in a grump, mussels tight-lipped at the inevitable. Then I spot him - or is it a her? - in a polystyrene box under the counter. Some say hens are more tender, others disagree. There are five of them, their claws bound with rusty-pink rubber bands. They are struggling to move. </p> <p>Slowly, as if to reassure their prospective murderers of their freshness, they close the occasional eye or wave a tentacle. They are more exquisitely marked than I had ever really noticed before. A deep blue-black with paler edges, they have cute freckles and rust-coloured bristles. The queue moves slowly along like a chain gang. You get the feeling the lobsters are talking about us, wondering who is going to do the dirty deed. My method is chosen already: I shall put them briefly in the freezer and send them to sleep, and only then will I plunge them into boiling water. The counsel of perfection is that this method may just take the edge of the flavour, but at least I do get to feel better about it. </p> <p>The woman eighth in front of me points into the box. It suddenly dawns that I should have come earlier; apparently I am not the only one with murder in mind. A lad in a rubber apron picks up her choice, turns him over for her inspection, shrouds him in white paper and pops him in bag. She doesn't look like the sort of person who would be party to the inevitable slaughter that will go on later in her kitchen. But then neither did Rose West. </p> <p>I am level with the box now, my nose up against the window. I pick my quarry. He is far from the biggest - apparently they can be tough. His legs are intact (crippled lobsters come cheaper). Not an obvious beauty, he seems like the one least likely to be chosen. It occurs to me that this is exactly the way I chose my cat. </p> <p>I start to feel slightly light-headed and focus on an elderly man ahead who chooses a kipper with more thought than most of us would choose a tie. I look back. I am past the box now and level with some monkfish that have had their heads removed. Monkfish are the only fish with a face. That's why fishmongers decapitate them first - they can smile at you. </p> <p>Perhaps my lobster should have a name before being boiled and served up with a tomato salad. I start to think of something suitable for such a creature, with its cold eyes and unsmiling lips. I suddenly realise that my supper looks like Ann Widdecombe. </p> <p>There is only one person in front of me now and they are taking forever. A Dover sole, two sea bass and a shipping order (no pun intended) for tuna steaks for a barbecue. I am once again level with the lobsters' prison but, this time, there is no glass between us. Lenny the lobster has turned round to face me. My dinner is looking at me. He struggles once more to free himself from those rubber bands and I think not of his end in boiling water, but of his journey home, cocooned in plastic, unsure of his place of execution. </p> <p>But he will be able to watch me make the mayonnaise that will accompany him, and halve the lemon. He will see the water going into the pot, and the salt that will make a home from home. 'Being served, mate?' says a guy with a number-one haircut. 'Errm, no. Uhm, can I have a errr, a ummm...' One last glance and I see my prey has turned his back on me. I swallow. 'Err, a lobster please. Yes, just one. One of the ready-cooked ones.' </p> <p> <strong> Lemon and herb mayonnaise for lobster</strong> </p> <p> 2 large, free-range egg yolks </p> <p>100ml groundnut oil </p> <p>200ml mild, not too fruity, extra-virgin olive oil </p> <p>the juice of a large lemon </p> <p>a small bunch of tarragon </p> <p>100ml double cream </p> <p>Put the egg yolks into a large bowl. Sprinkle a pinch of salt over them and stir briefly with a whisk. Add a drop of groundnut oil, no more than half a teaspoon, and whisk it in. Add another and whisk that in, then a few more drops, whisking constantly. Now start to let it run in a trickle, but don't stop whisking. It is good to have help doing this so that one of you can whisk while the other pours. Once you have finished the groundnut oil, start adding the extra-virgin. </p> <p>At this point you should be able to feel the whisk becoming heavier, a sign that the mayonnaise is thickening. By the time you have almost finished, it should be thick enough to wobble. Once the oil is finished, give it one more really good beating. We will let the mayonnaise down later so it is lighter. </p> <p>Squeeze the lemons and fold the juice, drop by drop, into the mayonnaise.You will see it lighten in colour as the juice goes in. Now mix in the cream. The mayonnaise will thin a little, but you must stop if it is getting too thin - you want it to be smooth enough to spoon rather than pour over the lobster. </p> <p>Chop the herbs finely, though not so fine that they look like tea leaves. Fold them into the mayonnaise. Add salt or black pepper if it needs it. </p> <p> <strong> Buttered lobster</strong> </p> <p> I am not sure there is a better way to serve lobster than plainly boiled with lots of melted butter. The problem is that even a lobster straight from the pan will not always melt the butter you put in it, so you should use softened butter, and a little lemon juice. The method below is also extremely useful for making the most of a creature bought freshly cooked. In other words, lobster for wimps. </p> <p>1 live lobster per person </p> <p>a generous 50g butter per person </p> <p>lemons, quartered </p> <p>Kill the lobster in which ever way you think fit. If, like me, you are unhappy about dispatching it yourself, buy it from a fishmonger you know and trust to sell you one boiled just hours - rather than days - before. Cut the lobster in half lengthways and remove the meat from the body and from inside the claws, saving every bit of juice you can. Keep the two halves of shell. Try to keep the flesh in chunks. </p> <p>Warm the butter in a shallow pan over a high heat until it starts to froth, then add the lobster meat. Do this quickly, tossing the meat over in the butter till it is hot, then pile it back into the shells. Let the butter in the pan sizzle for a minute or two longer, then pour in any juices you managed to save when you split the lobster. Drizzle it and any odd bits left in the pan over the lobster. </p> <p>Serve immediately, while the butter is still foaming. Squeeze lemon over as you eat. </p> <p> <strong> Killing your lobster</strong> </p> <p> Those who wish to kill their own lobster, and are obviously braver than I, have a choice of methods. If you have a very large pot, drop your lobsters, one at a time, into boiling water. Fans of this method insist the lobster dies quickly (how would they know?) </p> <p>Others suggest putting the lobster into cold water and slowly bringing it to the boil. The idea is that he nods off. This sounds like a lingering death. Others still swear by putting theirs into the freezer for an hour where he will apparently go to sleep, but the flesh will not quite freeze. He can then be cooked without suffering any pain. </p> <p>The RSPCA apparently prefers the knife method, which involves splitting the lobster in half while it is alive. This may well be true, but it is completely beyond this cook. The choice is yours.</p>",

Add another and whisk that in, then a few more drops, whisking constantly. Now start to let it run in a trickle, but don't stop whisking. It is good to have help doing this so that one of you can whisk while the other pours. Once you have finished the groundnut oil, start adding the extra-virgin. At this point you should be able to feel the whisk becoming heavier, a sign that the mayonnaise is thickening. By the time you have almost finished, it should be thick enough to wobble. Once the oil is finished, give it one more really good beating. We will let the mayonnaise down later so it is lighter. Squeeze the lemons and fold the juice, drop by drop, into the mayonnaise.You will see it lighten in colour as the juice goes in. Now mix in the cream. The mayonnaise will thin a little, but you must stop if it is getting too thin - you want it to be smooth enough to spoon rather than pour over the lobster. Chop the herbs finely, though not so fine that they look like tea leaves. Fold them into the mayonnaise. Add salt or black pepper if it needs it. Buttered lobster I am not sure there is a better way to serve lobster than plainly boiled with lots of melted butter. The problem is that even a lobster straight from the pan will not always melt the butter you put in it, so you should use softened butter, and a little lemon juice. The method below is also extremely useful for making the most of a creature bought freshly cooked. In other words, lobster for wimps. 1 live lobster per person a generous 50g butter per person lemons, quartered Kill the lobster in which ever way you think fit. If, like me, you are unhappy about dispatching it yourself, buy it from a fishmonger you know and trust to sell you one boiled just hours - rather than days - before. Cut the lobster in half lengthways and remove the meat from the body and from inside the claws, saving every bit of juice you can. Keep the two halves of shell. Try to keep the flesh in chunks. Warm the butter in a shallow pan over a high heat until it starts to froth, then add the lobster meat. Do this quickly, tossing the meat over in the butter till it is hot, then pile it back into the shells. Let the butter in the pan sizzle for a minute or two longer, then pour in any juices you managed to save when you split the lobster. Drizzle it and any odd bits left in the pan over the lobster. Serve immediately, while the butter is still foaming. Squeeze lemon over as you eat. Killing your lobster Those who wish to kill their own lobster, and are obviously braver than I, have a choice of methods. If you have a very large pot, drop your lobsters, one at a time, into boiling water. Fans of this method insist the lobster dies quickly (how would they know?) Others suggest putting the lobster into cold water and slowly bringing it to the boil. The idea is that he nods off. This sounds like a lingering death. Others still swear by putting theirs into the freezer for an hour where he will apparently go to sleep, but the flesh will not quite freeze. He can then be cooked without suffering any pain. The RSPCA apparently prefers the knife method, which involves splitting the lobster in half while it is alive. This may well be true, but it is completely beyond this cook. The choice is yours.",

      "body": "<p>While the vegetable garden on our heavy, slow-warm soil is still emergent (although the broad beans are picking well and the artichokes have finally hit some sort of stride), the herb garden is certainly at its best, the whole area as fresh as herbs on a white plate. I think that the flowers of ordinary sage are, in their prime, worth their space in any border and the leaves of lovage and fennel are fabulous. But it only really looks good from early May to July, so to have an area solely devoted to herbs is not just a luxury on space but on time as well. We dress its shortcomings in spring with tulips and forget-me-nots, but it is harder to distract from its tiredness after mid-July. I have a tray of Nicotiana sylvestris left and perhaps they will go in there and act as a foil. Certainly there is something herbal, even medicinal, about the resiny scent of tobacco plants at dusk. </p> <p>We have finished off the paths in the garden, three of which stopped short of their destination since we altered and extended the layout of the Jewel garden. This involved the delivery of a lorry-load of scalpings and a lorry-load of 'redgra' - a powdery, sandy gravel that binds when compacted and wet. Once formed, it makes a hard surface not unlike beaten earth, but it needs very good drainage beneath it if it is not to become a sticky mud in very wet weather. In an ideal world, I would have all the paths grass, because nothing looks better at this time of year. But our soil and climate mean this is utterly impractical, so we are slowly making all our working paths hard, with redgra and brick. In summer it seems an act of vandalism, but I know that come October I will regret not being more radical and doing more while the weather - and ground - is reasonably dry. </p> <p>Our 64 box balls need cutting, but I have been too busy and too weary - the remnants of a flu bug nipping at my heels. I want them to grow as large as possible and always agonise between cutting them to maintain a good compact form and leaving as much on as possible. </p> <p>I wonder if it is worth growing strawberries at all. I love a strawberry eaten warm from the garden, but the slugs take half of our crop and I have yet to find a proper deterrent for them. It might make more sense to surrender and to grow a slug-proof crop on the same ground. But is this common sense or defeatism? </p> <p> The opening of the script for Channel 4's Real Gardens was written along the following lines: 'Welcome to Real Gardens - Monty, this is your chance to say something personal about the season or something you love.' I had all of 10 or 15 seconds to fill. Something personal about midsummer...</p> <p>Here goes. In 10 seconds I shall say how there is this rolling midsummer fever in my veins, made of light falling through the leaves, made of the smell of the first roses and honeysuckle and musky tobacco plants in the dusk, made of the richness of this earth that astonishes me more every year, made of the thinnest of skies at five in the morning drawn up like a wispy tent by half a dozen larks, made of the patient husbanding of the vegetable garden, bringing food to the table with all the skill I can muster, made of the evenings that stay alive past 10, the sky turning Prussian blue but still lit enough from inside to walk torchless at midnight. </p> <p>Is that OK? Did it fit? There is more, of course. These are just hints, just pointers. It doesn't work. You get nowhere near it and yet not to attempt to tell everybody is a dereliction of duty. This, if anyone cares, is why I garden. All the sensations, and ancillary emotions towed along with them, bundled into moments of perfection. This is as good as it gets. </p> <p>Midsummer is not necessarily the high-spot, but there are weeks and sometimes months when only memory and anticipation sustain you. Midsummer is a cairn on top of the year, and there is a view to be taken from here. </p> <p>For a start, there are all the temporal measurements that have taken place this week on the pinnacle of the year - summer solstice, the longest day, the middle of the calendar - as though we reach this peak, take a breather, and then trudge down the other side to the unrelieved gloom of the winter solstice. But it is not the garden's summit. That comes later - in this garden, perhaps as late as September, when the vegetable plot is spilling with its harvest and the borders have that rich, late-season intensity. But because there is this sensation of so much more to come, coupled with maximum light, maximum time and freshness, it is a time to celebrate. </p> <p>Intimacy is at the centre of all good gardening, so your own backyard is always the most interesting, or at least, it should be. Broad horticultural sweeps of the brush make for dull pictures. For a start, you inevitably load certain plants with significance that the casual eye does not share. At this time of year, for me, those plants are the roses. I adore old roses and they never fail to repay that adoration, even in a mildewy, blackspotty, aphid-coated season. Is there anything in the garden more beautiful than the rich pink buds of 'Chapeau de Napoleon' opening from its bright green tricorn? If so, it is probably the sliced-off flowers of the gallica 'Charles de Mills', the white flowers of the damask 'Madame Hardy', the intensity of the gallica 'Tuscany Superb', the alba 'Celestial', the incredible velvety cherry red of 'Scharlachglut' before they bleach pink in the sun... and 50 more. Every day in June, when I am at home, I go and cut a selection of about a dozen different roses and put them in small vases - just the flowers - on the kitchen table, our desks, bedside tables. If you don't like roses, then you're simply growing the wrong ones. </p> <p>Sweet peas have to be cut, too. Their season has begun, although it will hit maximum intensity in a month's time. We grow ours on wigwams of six hazel bean sticks, planting a 4in pot with two sweet peas in it to each stick, so each wigwam has 12 plants of the same type. </p> <p>The Jewel garden has sweet peas with rich single colours, such as 'Black Knight', 'Violet Queen' and 'Hannah Dale' and the walled garden, which is a much softer, gentle place and has most of the old roses, includes Spencer varieties with good scent, such as 'Cream Southborne', 'Lovejoy' and 'Gipsy Queen', as well as the original 'Cupani'. I have written about sweet peas before, but suffice to say that I cannot imagine midsummer without them. A bunch of sweet peas has incredible healing power and seems to combine the inevitable components of nostalgia with a life-affirming intensity of the moment. </p> <p>The third component of the midsummer flower garden, which seems to form a trinity in my association, is the poppies. The oriental poppies are pretty much done, but the opium, field and shirley poppies are at their best. Field poppies, Papaver rhoeas , lie patiently waiting for their moment for a remarkably long time. Each flower will produce around 17,000 seeds, of which about 3,000 will remain viable and dormant in untilled ground for at least a century before bursting into flower when the ground is disturbed and the seeds are exposed to light. We let these flourish wherever they appear - and they appear everywhere, from cracks paths to the onion bed. They usually get it wrong, poor dolts, but they somehow get an exemption from the degree of colour-ruthlessness we try and apply. </p> <p>Not solemn enough for heavy August and too fulsome for spring, the frilly silliness of opium poppies against their dusty leaves - also frilled like a 70s dress shirt - is exactly in the spirit of midsummer. There is a particular batch of 'Black peony' opium poppy, P somniferum , that has been popping up in the vegetable garden that would be fabulous in the Jewel garden. Poppies hate being moved once they have got to any size at all, but you can take a clump of seedlings in wet soil and move them. The only time I did this, from the kitchen garden, they turned out to be unacceptably anodyne pink - which would have been fine where they were, in among some main-crop potatoes - but hopelessly jarring among the purples, crimsons and oranges where I'd put them. </p> <p>The Jewel garden arrives at this end of June, intense without heaviness - a memorable lunch rather than a heavy dinner. It is held together by the combination of, among other things, delphiniums, roses, sweet Williams - of which we have nigricans and another with the most intense, shimmering magenta of any plant I have ever seen and whose seed packet I have lost. Geums, the ligularias 'The Rocket', 'Desdemona' and the unpronounceable Lprzewalksii, the last of the June-flowering clematises, the first of the dahlia 'Bishop of Llandaff' (setting a benchmark for red among all the is-it-red-is-it-pinks?) all lit by the great tracer sprays of Stipa gigantica . </p> <p>The spring garden has gone dormant and I only walk through it about once a week, but that's fine. It needs the rest. Only a hedge-width away, the foxgloves all along the pleached lime walk are perhaps past their true best, but have another week in them. By which time we shall be in July and, somehow, another season. * </p> <p> It is now safe to mow long grass without harming the spring flowers that you may have growing in it. But it is essential to collect all the cut grass and remove it if you want the same wildflowers to spread or even return next year. I have found that even very dry hay will compost well enough in a big heap if you leave it for a couple of years and put the sprinkler on to it in dry weather. It also acts as a good mulch for fruit trees. Put it around the trunk straightaway and let it rot down in situ. </p> <p>By the same token, you can now tidy up the leaves of bulbs such as daffodils and tulips without harming next season's flowers. If you grow them in pots, it is a good idea to take them out, clean the compost off and store them in a cool, dry place before repotting in the autumn. </p> <p>Lift irises that have been in the same site for the past three years or more, divide them and replant in as sunny a spot as possible, making sure that half the rhizome remains above the surface of the ground.</p>",

For a start, you inevitably load certain plants with significance that the casual eye does not share. At this time of year, for me, those plants are the roses. I adore old roses and they never fail to repay that adoration, even in a mildewy, blackspotty, aphid-coated season. Is there anything in the garden more beautiful than the rich pink buds of 'Chapeau de Napoleon' opening from its bright green tricorn? If so, it is probably the sliced-off flowers of the gallica 'Charles de Mills', the white flowers of the damask 'Madame Hardy', the intensity of the gallica 'Tuscany Superb', the alba 'Celestial', the incredible velvety cherry red of 'Scharlachglut' before they bleach pink in the sun... and 50 more. Every day in June, when I am at home, I go and cut a selection of about a dozen different roses and put them in small vases - just the flowers - on the kitchen table, our desks, bedside tables. If you don't like roses, then you're simply growing the wrong ones. Sweet peas have to be cut, too. Their season has begun, although it will hit maximum intensity in a month's time. We grow ours on wigwams of six hazel bean sticks, planting a 4in pot with two sweet peas in it to each stick, so each wigwam has 12 plants of the same type. The Jewel garden has sweet peas with rich single colours, such as 'Black Knight', 'Violet Queen' and 'Hannah Dale' and the walled garden, which is a much softer, gentle place and has most of the old roses, includes Spencer varieties with good scent, such as 'Cream Southborne', 'Lovejoy' and 'Gipsy Queen', as well as the original 'Cupani'. I have written about sweet peas before, but suffice to say that I cannot imagine midsummer without them. A bunch of sweet peas has incredible healing power and seems to combine the inevitable components of nostalgia with a life-affirming intensity of the moment. The third component of the midsummer flower garden, which seems to form a trinity in my association, is the poppies. The oriental poppies are pretty much done, but the opium, field and shirley poppies are at their best. Field poppies, Papaver rhoeas , lie patiently waiting for their moment for a remarkably long time. Each flower will produce around 17,000 seeds, of which about 3,000 will remain viable and dormant in untilled ground for at least a century before bursting into flower when the ground is disturbed and the seeds are exposed to light. We let these flourish wherever they appear - and they appear everywhere, from cracks paths to the onion bed. They usually get it wrong, poor dolts, but they somehow get an exemption from the degree of colour-ruthlessness we try and apply. Not solemn enough for heavy August and too fulsome for spring, the frilly silliness of opium poppies against their dusty leaves - also frilled like a 70s dress shirt - is exactly in the spirit of midsummer. There is a particular batch of 'Black peony' opium poppy, P somniferum , that has been popping up in the vegetable garden that would be fabulous in the Jewel garden. Poppies hate being moved once they have got to any size at all, but you can take a clump of seedlings in wet soil and move them. The only time I did this, from the kitchen garden, they turned out to be unacceptably anodyne pink - which would have been fine where they were, in among some main-crop potatoes - but hopelessly jarring among the purples, crimsons and oranges where I'd put them. The Jewel garden arrives at this end of June, intense without heaviness - a memorable lunch rather than a heavy dinner. It is held together by the combination of, among other things, delphiniums, roses, sweet Williams - of which we have nigricans and another with the most intense, shimmering magenta of any plant I have ever seen and whose seed packet I have lost. Geums, the ligularias 'The Rocket', 'Desdemona' and the unpronounceable Lprzewalksii, the last of the June-flowering clematises, the first of the dahlia 'Bishop of Llandaff' (setting a benchmark for red among all the is-it-red-is-it-pinks?) all lit by the great tracer sprays of Stipa gigantica . The spring garden has gone dormant and I only walk through it about once a week, but that's fine. It needs the rest. Only a hedge-width away, the foxgloves all along the pleached lime walk are perhaps past their true best, but have another week in them. By which time we shall be in July and, somehow, another season. * It is now safe to mow long grass without harming the spring flowers that you may have growing in it. But it is essential to collect all the cut grass and remove it if you want the same wildflowers to spread or even return next year. I have found that even very dry hay will compost well enough in a big heap if you leave it for a couple of years and put the sprinkler on to it in dry weather. It also acts as a good mulch for fruit trees. Put it around the trunk straightaway and let it rot down in situ. By the same token, you can now tidy up the leaves of bulbs such as daffodils and tulips without harming next season's flowers. If you grow them in pots, it is a good idea to take them out, clean the compost off and store them in a cool, dry place before repotting in the autumn. Lift irises that have been in the same site for the past three years or more, divide them and replant in as sunny a spot as possible, making sure that half the rhizome remains above the surface of the ground.",

      "body": "<p><strong> I'm a Man: Sex, Gods and Rock'n'Roll</strong><br>Ruth Padel<br>Faber &amp; Faber \u00a3.9.99, pp352<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502335488,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>Even the chapter headings of Ruth Padel's I'm a Man: Sex, Gods and Rock'n'Roll, a highly personalised, vivid and speculative critique of the history and meaning of popular music, are slightly exhausting. Here are just some of them: 'Power, War and Creativity: the Male Gods Round Desire'; 'When the Guitar Became a Gun: Empowering Violence'; 'Cross Dressing, Castrati, Camp'; 'Dylan: Creativity, Misogyny and Echo' and, my personal favourite,the simple, dramatic 'The Holy Axe'. </p> <p>It's lovely to imagine Padel sitting around with a bunch of brain-dead musician goons in a hotel room at four o'clock in the morning, a heap of class A drugs on the table between them, discussing this little lot. An earlier breed of rock star - Brian Eno, David Bowie, Brian Jones, Jimmy Page - might have gone for it, maybe strumming sitars and other unusual ethnic instruments, as they mused along with this expressive, passionate and, occasionally, slightly overwrought poet-writer about the darker psychological suburbs of rock'n'roll. </p> <p>The incessant male validation and misogyny. The theft from black artists. The imagery. The primality. The glory. The sex, drugs and shame. Padel would probably have had to put up with them staring down her top while they were doing it, but she might just have got a semblance of a decent conversation out of them. </p> <p>Sadly, however, I could tell Padel for nothing that not many of the present crop of male British rock and pop stars would even understand what she was talking about, never mind be able to join in with words of more than two syllables. Pulp's Jarvis Cocker or Primal Scream's Bobby Gillespie at a push. Asian Dub Foundation for the race issues. Paul Weller if you caught him in a good mood running between Winnebagos at Glastonbury. </p> <p>However, could you imagine Oasis's contribution to the debate 'Heroes Are Violent, Dark, Against - Especially In the Theatre'? Even the Manic Street Preachers would probably slope off, wrapped in a Welsh footie flag, somewhere around the chapter, 'Marine Magic: Saving, Veiling, Faking' . As the great Shane MacGowan, then of the Pogues, once said to an intensely theorising, earnest New Musical Express colleague of mine: 'Jeeshush shut up, you're boring the arsh off me.' </p> <p>Sometimes, Ruth, you really have to wonder why we bother. Books like I'm A Man are not really for musicians - they're always too drunk or too drugged, sometimes as a disguise for their innate laziness or stupidity, otherwise simply because they were born to be druggy drunks and theories about Sophocles, and his links to modern-day rock make their brain hurt. In a way, you've got to be sympathetic. Music is, by definition, an instinctive rather than intellectual discipline and a beer could go flat in the time it takes Padel to argue through her more intricate theories about men, women, culture, libido, myth and reality. </p> <p>Saying that, Padel should be congratulated for not having produced the standard fan/critic tome. I'm A Man is basically the evergreen fan lament: 'Rock'n'roll ruined my life!', but it spins around an intellectual axis, vents a polemicised, gender-based spleen and paints a frequently touching subtext of the young Padel coming to terms with the fact that the music she is obsessed by is doomed to let her down on every level - as a thinker, a fan, a humanitarian and a woman. </p> <p>It starts as it means to go on, with a rant about the correlation of Greek myth to rock'n'roll, splicing rock quotes with history, and Padel's own thoughts. 'How come we do not realise how extremely strange rock culture and its conventions are?' she asks. 'Why the enormous stadia? Why the groupies, the screaming hysteria, crowd surfing and enormous theatricity?' </p> <p>Padel concludes at this point that our knee-jerk acceptance of standard rock mores is strange and then goes on to find a lot of other things strange. At times, you agree wholeheartedly with her thought processes and her choice of data. As one might expect from a book entitled I'm A Man, Padel is particularly vivid when talking about the coruscating sexism and racism that have burrowed like woodworm through rock from the time the white man decided to claim the 'boogie' as his own big idea, and sideline female musicians as mere glorified groupies. </p> <p>The chapters on the enduring emphasis on 'cock in rock' are amusing, while the passages on the science and poetry of the rock crowd, and the dissections of the really rather bizarre rituals we all take for granted, are original and beautifully expressed. </p> <p> I'm A Man isn't a perfect music book, like Greil Marcus's Mystery Train or the Osmonds 1976 annual. For instance, some might take umbrage at the way Padel doesn't work her way methodically through the history; she rather makes the facts squeeze themselves into interesting shapes to adapt to her theories. Then there is the slightly grating way she hops through musical genres like a man rushing around duty free trying to find a last-minute present for his wife. </p> <p>Most unforgivably, the tone occasionally 'slums it' a little too obviously.

      "bodyText": "I'm a Man: Sex, Gods and Rock'n'Roll Ruth Padel Faber &amp; Faber \u00a3.9.99, pp352 Buy it at BOL Even the chapter headings of Ruth Padel's I'm a Man: Sex, Gods and Rock'n'Roll, a highly personalised, vivid and speculative critique of the history and meaning of popular music, are slightly exhausting. Here are just some of them: 'Power, War and Creativity: the Male Gods Round Desire'; 'When the Guitar Became a Gun: Empowering Violence'; 'Cross Dressing, Castrati, Camp'; 'Dylan: Creativity, Misogyny and Echo' and, my personal favourite,the simple, dramatic 'The Holy Axe'. It's lovely to imagine Padel sitting around with a bunch of brain-dead musician goons in a hotel room at four o'clock in the morning, a heap of class A drugs on the table between them, discussing this little lot. An earlier breed of rock star - Brian Eno, David Bowie, Brian Jones, Jimmy Page - might have gone for it, maybe strumming sitars and other unusual ethnic instruments, as they mused along with this expressive, passionate and, occasionally, slightly overwrought poet-writer about the darker psychological suburbs of rock'n'roll. The incessant male validation and misogyny. The theft from black artists. The imagery. The primality. The glory. The sex, drugs and shame. Padel would probably have had to put up with them staring down her top while they were doing it, but she might just have got a semblance of a decent conversation out of them. Sadly, however, I could tell Padel for nothing that not many of the present crop of male British rock and pop stars would even understand what she was talking about, never mind be able to join in with words of more than two syllables. Pulp's Jarvis Cocker or Primal Scream's Bobby Gillespie at a push. Asian Dub Foundation for the race issues. Paul Weller if you caught him in a good mood running between Winnebagos at Glastonbury. However, could you imagine Oasis's contribution to the debate 'Heroes Are Violent, Dark, Against - Especially In the Theatre'? Even the Manic Street Preachers would probably slope off, wrapped in a Welsh footie flag, somewhere around the chapter, 'Marine Magic: Saving, Veiling, Faking' . As the great Shane MacGowan, then of the Pogues, once said to an intensely theorising, earnest New Musical Express colleague of mine: 'Jeeshush shut up, you're boring the arsh off me.' Sometimes, Ruth, you really have to wonder why we bother. Books like I'm A Man are not really for musicians - they're always too drunk or too drugged, sometimes as a disguise for their innate laziness or stupidity, otherwise simply because they were born to be druggy drunks and theories about Sophocles, and his links to modern-day rock make their brain hurt. In a way, you've got to be sympathetic. Music is, by definition, an instinctive rather than intellectual discipline and a beer could go flat in the time it takes Padel to argue through her more intricate theories about men, women, culture, libido, myth and reality. Saying that, Padel should be congratulated for not having produced the standard fan/critic tome. I'm A Man is basically the evergreen fan lament: 'Rock'n'roll ruined my life!', but it spins around an intellectual axis, vents a polemicised, gender-based spleen and paints a frequently touching subtext of the young Padel coming to terms with the fact that the music she is obsessed by is doomed to let her down on every level - as a thinker, a fan, a humanitarian and a woman. It starts as it means to go on, with a rant about the correlation of Greek myth to rock'n'roll, splicing rock quotes with history, and Padel's own thoughts. 'How come we do not realise how extremely strange rock culture and its conventions are?' she asks. 'Why the enormous stadia? Why the groupies, the screaming hysteria, crowd surfing and enormous theatricity?' Padel concludes at this point that our knee-jerk acceptance of standard rock mores is strange and then goes on to find a lot of other things strange. At times, you agree wholeheartedly with her thought processes and her choice of data. As one might expect from a book entitled I'm A Man, Padel is particularly vivid when talking about the coruscating sexism and racism that have burrowed like woodworm through rock from the time the white man decided to claim the 'boogie' as his own big idea, and sideline female musicians as mere glorified groupies. The chapters on the enduring emphasis on 'cock in rock' are amusing, while the passages on the science and poetry of the rock crowd, and the dissections of the really rather bizarre rituals we all take for granted, are original and beautifully expressed. I'm A Man isn't a perfect music book, like Greil Marcus's Mystery Train or the Osmonds 1976 annual. For instance, some might take umbrage at the way Padel doesn't work her way methodically through the history; she rather makes the facts squeeze themselves into interesting shapes to adapt to her theories. Then there is the slightly grating way she hops through musical genres like a man rushing around duty free trying to find a last-minute present for his wife. Most unforgivably, the tone occasionally 'slums it' a little too obviously. At such times, one is reminded of when newspapers send the esteemed, highbrow likes of Vikram Seth, Martin Amis or Salman Rushdie off to do something populist and 'ordinary' (darts; football; pop concerts) and they come back all over-excited about the 'common man' and have to be put to bed early. Saying that, I'm A Man is a credible, interesting book, written with a mulekick style and researched with obvious passion. After this, the air-guitar hero will never be able to admire himself strumming away in front of the bedroom mirror with quite the same ill-informed, cock-centric, humourless intensity ever again.",

      "body": "<p>Kevin Keegan asked to be judged on results, and he has been. England took an early flight home after losing two leads, two matches and most of their credibility by playing some of the most gormless football at Euro 2000, but the FA are standing by their man. </p> <p>Keegan may be an ideal ambassador for English football between fixtures, but as soon as matches begin the bold words and positive outlook are revealed as mere wishful thinking. There is no doubt that Keegan has just presided over the biggest shambles since the Graham Taylor era, or that the gains made by Terry Venables and Glenn Hoddle in realigning English football with the rest of the world have been squandered. From a 20-minute high in the game against Portugal, England went backwards, stripping back the years like time travellers as they did so to arrive at the point where the rest of Europe is once again laughing at us. </p> <p>Two things appear to be preserving Keegan from a fate similar to Taylor's. The first is that he took over halfway through qualifying, and deserves a modicum of credit for getting England to Euro 2000 at all. The second is the defeat of Germany in Charleroi, that allowed a brief interlude of optimism and saved Keegan and England from the three straight defeats which would surely have made the manager's position untenable. Even so, three straight defeats was all England's football deserved, but luck sent along the worst German team in living memory to make Keegan's side feel a little better about themselves, at least until Portugal's reserves put the hard-fought 1-0 win into perspective. </p> <p>Perhaps the FA are right and Keegan deserves a chance over the full four years of his contract, although to be around in 2002 the manager needs to steer England through World Cup qualification, which cannot be taken for granted. Opponents like Germany, Greece, Finland and Albania might not appear too daunting, but England do not yet have a single performance in the bank under Keegan to make any of those sides unduly concerned. Based on the evidence of the past 18 months, it is all too easy to imagine England being frustrated in Helsinki or Athens. </p> <p>'Since I've been in charge, I've never seen us play as well as we can,' Keegan admitted. 'I take responsibility for England never reaching their peak, but I don't see any reason to offer my resignation. We can get through our World Cup qualification.' </p> <p>The FA still want Keegan, the Press is not yet calling for his head - so it looks as if we will be sticking with gormless football for the foreseeable future. There are two likely outcomes. Either England screw up in qualifying and another manager will be brought in to try and get the 2002 campaign back on the rails, or Keegan's side will stagger into the World Cup finals and make the sort of impression on Japan and Korea they have just made on Belgium and Holland. </p> <p>'You can doubt me, you can question my suitability for the job, but my life's been about proving people wrong,' Keegan said in that melodramatic way of his. He means his life as a player. He has not proved many people wrong as a manager, either at Newcastle ('I've taken this club as far as I can, I don't know how to go a stage further') or with England ('I wanted to show we were better than our qualifying form suggested, but we never managed to do that'). The question now is whether Keegan can learn from his mistakes, or at least it ought to be. The fact is Keegan is not admitting any mistakes, so don't hold your breath. Nonetheless, here are 10 reasons why Keegan failed at Euro 2000, and will probably continue to fail in the World Cup. </p> <p>(1)<strong> Having too much faith in the ability of Alan Shearer</strong> </p> <p>Keegan clearly expected his captain to be banging in the goals like it was Euro 96 all over again, terrorising the world's best defences and galvanising his own players with clench-fisted exhortations to follow his example. For the past two years this has been pure fantasy. Shearer was of only limited value to England in the last World Cup, and has done little since to warrant the slavish devotion of successive England managers. Hoddle would surely have tried an alternative by now, whereas Keegan would still be picking him for the World Cup qualifiers had not Shearer himself called it a day. </p> <p>What Shearer knows, but Keegan appears unable to grasp, is that he is a sadly diminished player since his ankle injury three years ago. Every utterance Keegan makes, including the outrageous accusation that press criticism has hounded his captain off the international stage, conveys the impression that Shearer can play for England for at least another two years if he wishes. </p> <p>(2)<strong> Making Shearer captain</strong> </p> <p>All of the above was apparent when Keegan took over from Hoddle in February last year. Shearer's lacklustre performances and defeated body language were already attracting comment, yet the first thing Keegan did on becoming England manager was appoint Shearer his captain even though his form did not warrant a place in the team. That meant England always played more or less the same way, with David Beckham and whoever could be found for the left wing required to supply crosses from wide positions. And with Shearer a constant presence, alternative strikers - Michael Owen, Andy Cole or Robbie Fowler - were only seen in relation to him, and rarely in their own right. </p> <p>(3)<strong> Taking Michael Owen off at half time against Portugal</strong> </p> <p>Had this been a more decisive fixture, rather than the first match of the European Championship, this revealing substitution might have ended up haunting Keegan in a Gary Lineker-Graham Taylor way. The difference is that Owen's career is not over, it must just have felt that way after he was pulled off in favour of Emile Heskey. </p> <p>Keegan said he wanted a different sort of player up front, one who could hold the ball up. Heskey is certainly different to Owen, whether or not he can hold the ball up. As it happened, against Portugal, he couldn't. Nor, in a month of Sundays, could Heskey produce the sort of alert response and instinctive vision that Owen showed in the first half to find Beckham in the move that created the second goal. </p> <p>(4)<strong> Ignoring birth certificates</strong> </p> <p>Keegan picks players on form, ability and experience, and does not take age into account. This is why Stuart Pearce may yet add to his England caps in World Cup qualifiers this autumn, and why the spine of the England team is being allowed to age together. </p> <p>In fairness, there are not that many convincing young candidates queueing up to take over from Seaman, Adams, Ince and Shearer, but the downside of coaxing one last tournament out of the old guard is that there is now no time to adapt to the next. Keegan reacted to the suggestion England might use Euro 2000 to prepare for the World Cup as if it were treasonable. 'I'm not going to turn my back on the players who got us here,' he said, disregarding the fact that England had hardly qualified impressively. </p> <p>But surely now Keegan will usher in the young players and begin to dismantle the team? Don't bank on it. 'This is not the end of the line for Adams, Ince and Seaman, I'd like to double underline that,' Keegan said after elimination. 'You can't look to the future too much when you're trying to qualify for a tournament.' </p> <p>(5)<strong> Believing England could win Euro 2000</strong> </p> <p>'Expectancy is something I've always encouraged,' said Keegan, who reiterated his belief that England could win the event even after defeat by Portugal. 'I don't regret it. That's my job. What do you want me to say? That we won't do very well? We had a chance of winning. Had we faced Italy we would have been two games from the final. That's a chance. I am an optimist. I don't surround myself with people who want to be negative or see the dark side of everything.' </p> <p>(6)<strong> Being so optimistic</strong> </p> <p>There is nothing wrong with positive thinking, but Keegan must be the only person in the world who believed his preferred England team, with its ageing spine, non-existent left wing and predictable tactics, could sweep all before them. Had he never seen France, Holland, or even Portugal? 'We're not like France and Holland, and we can't play like Brazil or Portugal,' he said. 'It's not what we are brought up on, our strengths are different. But if we could learn to play it from the back, keep hold of the ball, and add that to our long ball strengths and our crossing, we could have a combination with a chance.' </p> <p>Four years ago Venables unashamedly copied Dutch tactics and ended up thrashing Holland 4-1, still the post-1966 high point of English football. The players are mostly still around, indeed some exciting new ones have arrived, but now Keegan admits they can't play a passing game. Evidently there is a limit to his optimism. </p> <p>(7)<strong> Being too conservative in his selection</strong> </p> <p>'Everyone knows the way we play,' Keegan even confessed. 'We like to get down the wings and get in crosses for our front men, and as long as I'm in charge I hope we always will.' </p> <p>Keegan does not appear worried that hardly anyone else still plays like this, or that England's recent results scarcely justify such unshakeable belief. 'There's no point talking about tactics or formation if you can't even pass the ball,' Keegan said. But England players can pass the ball. As Keegan says, they do it in the Premiership all the time. What they lacked in Euro 2000 was a shape to make life difficult for their opponents and a system to make ball retention easier. </p> <p>(8)<strong> Inability to change things round on the pitch</strong> </p> <p>Perhaps, as Dennis Wise has said, this is as much the players' fault as the manager's. Yet having picked a 4-4-2 formation for the first game and then watched as Portugal's alleged wide players tucked inside to leave the Nevilles with nothing to do and Ince with two or three men at a time to deal with, England's response was slow. 'We want to be playing this game in their half of the pitch,' Keegan had said beforehand. Even before Portugal equalised it was clear this plan was not working. England's outnumbered midfield was in full retreat, and the game was played almost exclusively in England's half. The same thing was allowed to happen again against Romania - entirely predictably - just because Keegan thought the system had worked well enough against Germany. </p> <p>(9)<strong> According senior players too much respect</strong> </p> <p>Keegan is a manager who listens to his senior players, and it is hard to criticise him for that. Perhaps significantly, however, for a manager who constantly harps on about how callously he was dropped by Bobby Robson, Keegan has yet to establish he can deal with the tricky matter of ending an ageing player's England days.

Others would offer the less kindly view that Keegan copped out on Shearer all along, surrendered the initiative to his captain and allowed him to do more or less as he pleased. Shearer has gone now, but Keegan has yet to show he can make a difficult decision. </p> <p>(10)<strong> Rating Emile Heskey as a successor to Shearer</strong> </p> <p>Heskey has his good points, though not many of them were easily discernible in this tournament and Liverpool must have had at least half the value wiped off their \u00a311m investment. But post-Shearer we do not need a replacement so much as a rethink. England have just spent two years asking too much of ordinary players like Shearer and Phil Neville, while simultaneously failing to get the best from class acts like Beckham, Scholes and Owen. We might not be as lavishly endowed with talented players as France, Holland and Portugal, but - with the talent we do have - we ought not to be flying home early with the Slovenians and Scandinavians. </p> <p>A good coach with firm ideas could sort it out, but while the FA continue to persist with a good PR man instead, the best plan might be to ignore the Keegan rhetoric and go into the next World Cup expecting the worst.</p>",
