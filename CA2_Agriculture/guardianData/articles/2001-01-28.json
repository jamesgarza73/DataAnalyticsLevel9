      "body": "<p>All last night, I was doing Ian Rickson's job for him. In my mind's eye, the scene I watched him rehearse from Kevin Elyot's new play Mouth to Mouth would not let me go. Words and gestures kept coming back. I teased at them; they teased back. The scene seemed a riddle with many possible answers. It is the nearest I will ever come to understanding how consuming a director's work must be. </p> <p>Ian Rickson took over as artistic director of the Royal Court from Stephen Daldry in 1998. He presided over the last stages of the Court's \u00a329 million revamp, and his production of Conor McPherson's Dublin Carol opened the new theatre in March 2000. His zestful treatment of Jez Butterworth's 1950s gangster play Mojo (1995) launched him; his production of Conor McPherson's The Weir made his name. </p> <p>Rickson is tall and boyish (at 37) with toffee-brown eyes, a hooked nose and severely short hair. He is a little camp, though not gay. (He lives with theatre director Polly Teale and has a teenage son, Jack, by a previous partner). He is beautifully turned out on the afternoon we meet, in cream trousers and cardi gan and black leather slippers. His elegant, minimal appearance is like the quality of his work: no excrescences or gimmicks. In this, he is part of Royal Court tradition. </p> <p>When I ask him if he thinks Stephen Daldry a 'hard act to follow', he answers that Daldry is 'an inspiring person', but the question is not one he asks himself. He likens the Court's work to a 'narrative' of which he is a part. He acknowledges a stylistic link with the 1950s English Stage company who aimed to 'create actor-led, uncluttered stagecraft.' He says there is a 'collegiate' feeling between himself, Daldry, Max Stafford Clark, Peter Gill, Jocelyn Herbert and others who have worked at the Court. It was Stafford Clark who gave Rickson his first break, making him a director for the Young People's Theatre at the Court. </p> <p>Rickson is laid back and eager at the same time, a combination that is all his own. He is impossible not to like, even though his sweetness sometimes seems precious. But he is surprisingly hard to interview: there is a great deal that needs to be 'off the record' and about the record itself, he is visibly concerned. He does not want to sound pompous, pretentious, 'tight-arsed', evangelical. </p> <p>He need not worry so much. The only tricky thing about him is the extent to which he hopes to manage his own image. I put it to him that the flipside of his niceness is that he minds terribly what other people think. He looks a little taken aback (hurt even?) but agrees: 'Yes, true.' He reflects that sensitivity matters, it is important to care about work but maintains such feelings 'shouldn't be in the [rehearsal] room. Actors should never have to pick up on a director's insecurity - just as children do not want to know when their parents are unhappy.' </p> <p>Rickson was born in Chaldon, south- east London. His father was an agency sports reporter, his mother an usherette at the Ambassadors theatre. He read English at Essex where he also acted a great deal. I first met him in 1988 when he entered a Young Directors competition at the Battersea Arts Centre. He did not win. I no longer remember who did but have never forgotten Ian. He was clad in black like a trainee Hamlet, and something about him blazed. </p> <p>He was emphatic about what he wanted to do: to direct contemporary work. And now his wish has more than come true: the Royal Court is the largest commissioning theatre in the world. But why this absolute commitment to new writing? (I remember once commenting that Rickson's zeal was enough to make one feel one should take umbrage on behalf of all old or dead playwrights): 'It is the most interesting thing to work with playwrights on new plays because there is no context, no Coles notes, no previous perfor mances. We are hurtled into the present together... there is an exhilaration about this.' </p> <p>He did not need to tell me. I had seen it in practice. Between 2pm and 5.45pm in a snazzy rehearsal room opposite the Young Vic, I watched Rickson direct Lindsay Duncan, Michael Maloney and Barnaby Kay. My first impression was that Rickson resembled a gentle teacher (all good teachers get students to think for themselves). 'The best directors are good listeners,' Rickson remarked later. He asked actors questions about how their characters felt. 'What is the rhythm of that?' he might wonder, about a particular gesture. Rhythm is 'really important' to him. To direct well, you must have a 'good ear'. I was impressed by his careful approach to time and by the way he scored speech, as if it were music. </p> <p>Actors will be the first to tell you that their work is emotionally 'draining.' But I felt wrung out just watching Lindsay Duncan. Over and over, she found her way into the grief of the last scene in which she mourns the death of a son. She has a gift for elegy: a voice from elsewhere: soft, starved. Ian listened with total attention to everything she had to say about her part. </p> <p>When I read Kevin Elyot's Mouth to Mouth (Elyot is most famous for his My Night with Reg , though Rickson has also directed the tender, introverted The Day I Stood Still for the National) I found it a slender, depressed piece: all bones and no flesh. Ian regards it as 'beautifully written and formally precise' and thinks 'the sensibility which links sex and death feels very contemporary'. I tell him I was moved in rehearsal. Perhaps I had failed to mind the gap between page and stage. </p> <p>Rickson wishes he could have longer rehearsal periods. How much does administration interfere with his creative work? 'Attitude is all. If you feel the administration is cumbersome and beleaguering then everything becomes difficult. You have to think of going to meet some rich donor who might support the theatre as a creative act' </p> <p>Rickson intervenes more in the later stages of rehearsal. I liked the way that, at every chance, he seemed keen to extend the humanity of the play. 'I think you go to the theatre to try and understand what it is to be human', he said later. He is anything but a nihilist. </p> <p>There was a wonderful moment in which he suggested 'as an exercise' that Lindsay Duncan and Barnaby Kay tango - an allusion to their shared past. The exercise worked and was incorporated into the piece. 'As an exercise,' Rickson joked, is a 'trick' to get actors to try something out fearlessly. Watching, it seemed like magical sleight of hand. </p> <p>Rickson tells actors their gestures need to be 'earned'. Every line of the play is considered and given a context. The cast is encouraged to bring in anything that might help with the work, as a bird might fetch twigs for a nest. (I was reminded of a good primary school teacher again.) </p> <p>The cast was also sent on outings. Michael Maloney went to eat at the Ivy - as his character does in the play. Lindsay Duncan drew the short straw and went to Balham to identify the house in which her character might have lived. Kevin Elyot sat in on rehearsals and offered his comments and read aloud a marvellous piece, by A.C. Grayling, about death: 'The presence of those who lived can never be removed from the lives of those who cared about them, which gives them a kind of immortality.' </p> <p>What advice would Ian give to someone wanting to be a director? 'You need stubborn persistence' and 'an absolute fascination in people, so that you are sustained by curiosity'. I am sure it would be lovely to be directed by Rickson. He is unthreatening, hopeful, illuminating. In fact, he is top of the class. </p> <p>\u0095 Mouth to Mouth opens at the Royal Court on 6 February</p>",

I liked the way that, at every chance, he seemed keen to extend the humanity of the play. 'I think you go to the theatre to try and understand what it is to be human', he said later. He is anything but a nihilist. There was a wonderful moment in which he suggested 'as an exercise' that Lindsay Duncan and Barnaby Kay tango - an allusion to their shared past. The exercise worked and was incorporated into the piece. 'As an exercise,' Rickson joked, is a 'trick' to get actors to try something out fearlessly. Watching, it seemed like magical sleight of hand. Rickson tells actors their gestures need to be 'earned'. Every line of the play is considered and given a context. The cast is encouraged to bring in anything that might help with the work, as a bird might fetch twigs for a nest. (I was reminded of a good primary school teacher again.) The cast was also sent on outings. Michael Maloney went to eat at the Ivy - as his character does in the play. Lindsay Duncan drew the short straw and went to Balham to identify the house in which her character might have lived. Kevin Elyot sat in on rehearsals and offered his comments and read aloud a marvellous piece, by A.C. Grayling, about death: 'The presence of those who lived can never be removed from the lives of those who cared about them, which gives them a kind of immortality.' What advice would Ian give to someone wanting to be a director? 'You need stubborn persistence' and 'an absolute fascination in people, so that you are sustained by curiosity'. I am sure it would be lovely to be directed by Rickson. He is unthreatening, hopeful, illuminating. In fact, he is top of the class. \u0095 Mouth to Mouth opens at the Royal Court on 6 February",

Eddie Akuamoah forced a corner and when it came over Mark Harris headed fractionally over to underline ominous traits for the home team. Gradually City steadied down and Brian Tinnion's intuitive touches from midfield emerged. First his perfect pass was screwed wide by Lee Peacock; then Tinnion's own 30-yard drive was tipped on to the bar by the capable Gavin Kelly, a 19-year-old on loan from Spurs and Kingstonian's seventh keeper of the season. </p> <p>Chapple must self-consciously have been thinking of an eighth as Kelly was hurt going for a short back-pass, the worry was that the visitors had no keeper on the bench.

If you are just walking around on your own in a dark place that you don't know, then people will kill you. 'If you go together in a group then you are stronger. I think that's the difference. Because things aren't working out for us away from home, we have to learn to work as a unit. People have to back up each other - to fight together, not individually.' It is a message, of course, that Chelsea would do well to heed in today's FA Cup fourth round tie at Gillingham. But one Gillingham man who refuses to look upon Chelsea's vulnerability away from Stamford Bridge as a reason to be cheerful is their assistant-manager, Richard Hill. No doubt still haunted by the memory of Gillingham's 5-0 defeat by Chelsea last season, he says: 'It would be foolish for us to start talking about form playing any part,' he said. ' 'Both myself and Andy Hessenthaler [Gillingham's player-manager] are young men, but we are also experienced enough not get carried away with all of the hype.' In contrast, Scunthorpe's manager, Brian Laws, is nothing if not upbeat about the prospect of his team winning at Bolton. 'All the pressure is on Bolton,' Laws says. 'We fancy our chances.' And who can blame him after the way his side held their nerve in that Cup penalty shoot-out against Burnley last week.",

      "body": "<p>Barcelona is one of those unique cities that manages eternally to reinvent itself and always remain at the cutting edge of trends. Right now, a small neighbourhood known simply as El Born, off all the usual tourist tracks, has been transformed almost overnight into the stylish, in-vogue heart of the city. Just imagine Soho, Covent Garden and Notting Hill all rolled into one. </p> <p>Small, intimate, friendly and funky, 'Born' (as those in the know call it) is where just about everything fashionable is happening now - in art, clothes design, interior decoration, smart restaurants, cool cocktail lounges, chic wine bars and hip dance clubs. Visiting the Catalan capital for a weekend, it is all too easy to spend your time in crowds of other travellers wandering down the Ramblas, lining up to get into the splendid Picasso or Miro museums, following the trail of Gaudi monuments or exploring the Barrio Gotic - yesterday's trendy quarter, today already a sticky tourist trap. So wander off the well-trodden path to discover El Born, before it gets unmasked for everyone in guide books. </p> <p>The heart and soul of this community is the wide open, tree-lined Passeig del Born. From the thirteenth to the seventeenth centuries, this was pretty much the main square of Barcelona, the site of the city's public festivities, which included jousting tournaments, carnivals and even the burning of heretics during the Inquisition. At one end of the Passeig is an impressive metal and glass structure, the former Mercat del Born covered market, while at the other end is one of the most important Gothic churches in all Catalonia, Santa Maria del Mar. Although the Boquer\u00eda, on the Ramblas, may be the city's most famous food market, the main wholesale business was always done here at El Born and this 1870 building is more impressive architecturally. At the moment, though, it is empty as the traders have been moved to another part of the city, and no one can seem to agree what to do with such a magnificent structure. But with El Born transformed into the cultural hub of Barcelona, it seems almost certain that the market will be transformed into some sort of arts, film or book centre. </p> <p>The Eglesia de Santa Maria del Mar has no such identity problems. Known as the People's Cathedral, this is one of the most popular and frequented religious centres for city inhabitants, and whenever you choose to visit there is the feeling that this is an authentic, functioning place of worship rather than a tourist attraction. Built in the fourteenth century, both the exterior and interior have been wonderfully preserved and restoration work on paintings and stained-glass windows is in continual progress to ensure everyone's favourite church stays in an immaculate state. </p> <p>El Born has two distinct personalities, one daylight, the other nocturnal, the former geared up to shop till you drop, the latter dedicated to some serious partying. Here are a mixture of day and night locales, but just remember that to explore the neighbourhood's vibrant nightlife, you need to pace the evening well by not starting out too early. Most bars and restaurants do not even open till 9pm. </p> <p><strong> Shopping </strong></p> <p> <strong> E&amp;A Gispert</strong> <br> Carrer Sombrerers 23 </p> <p> Walking along the narrow Carrer Sombrerers - once the hat-making street of Barcelona - you cannot help noticing the enticing smell of freshly roasted coffee that is wafting out of an ancient shop called Gispert. This is an aromatic Aladdin's Cave of spices and herbs, teas and coffees, dried fruit and nuts from around the world. Founded in the 1850s, this venerable establishment feels and looks more like a museum than a simple food emporium. Make sure you take a peek in the back room where an ancient wood-burning stove is still used to roast the coffee. </p> <p> <strong> Galeria Principal Sombrerers</strong> <br> Carrer Sombrerers 1 </p> <p> Just a couple of doors down from Gispert is a bright, minimalist gallery, run by a friendly English woman, Lucina Fearon. It is the perfect place to get a feel for what is happening in the vibrant avant-garde art scene in Barcelona. As it specialises in prints and lithographs produced by young, up-and-coming artists, prices are surprisingly reasonable. So you may well end up buying an artwork to take home rather than the usual souvenirs. The city's main gallery-land is just round the corner, in Carrer Montcada. </p> <p> <strong> Las 40 Ladronas</strong> <br> Carrer Esparteria 17 </p> <p> The '40 Thieves' of this boutique's name are actually two young women fashion designers who create fun, daring one-off outfits out of secondhand clothes. Tucked down an alley, the boutique displays finished garments outside, stacked all over the place, while inside the scene is even more anarchic as the two women sit over sewing machines surrounded by piles of old clothes. Shoppers watching their budget can choose something cheap from the heaps; expect stiffer prices for the reworked garments. </p> <p> <strong> Vila Viniteca</strong> <br> Carrer dels Agullers 7 </p> <p> Wine enthusiasts from all over Barcelona are drawn to this respected store, which has been a feature of the since 1932 and boasts the city's most extensive selection of wines. There is only a small sign on the street, but expect a shock as you walk in, coming face to face with thousands of different bottles stacked on top of each other. Shop assistants have to climb tall ladders then teeter along narrow ledges to reach the highest shelves. Saturday morning is a good time to visit, as there are often free tastings of Catalan vintages. </p> <p> <strong> Atalanta Manufactura</strong> <br> Passeig del Born 10 </p> <p> Like many of the shops in El Born, Atalanta Manufactura is half-boutique, half-atelier, where you can watch artisans at work creating the merchandise on display. Here the speciality is hand-painted silks, linen and velvet, along with a small, offbeat selection of interior design objects. The genial owner will describe to you in delightful broken-English that the philosphy of her designs is seduction, but should you fail to be seduced then check out the shop next door, Rafa Teja Atelier, whose hand-painted cloth is more conventional. </p> <p> <strong> Nayamau</strong> <br> Passeig del Born 12 </p> <p> Many passers-by walk straight past the messy workshop of interior designer Mauricio Gosalvez, but it serves as his shop too, and you will soon realise that many of the fashionable furniture and ornaments decorating El Born's trendy bars and restaurants are created here. Items like the pastel-coloured one-off lamps are small enough to take straight back home with you, but Gosalvez is also able to propose unique furniture designs to order. </p> <p><strong> Bars and tapas </strong></p> <p> <strong> Pitin Bar</strong> <br> Passeig del Born 34 (Metro Jaume I) </p> <p> The area has only recently become the trendiest part of the city, but the friendly Pitin Bar has been an stylish outpost here for more than 20 years. Opened originally as a restaurant, it has been turned it into a cool bar and lounge by the owner's son Ram\u00f3n. It still serves light snacks and has a sunny terrace in the main square during the day, but it is best as a late-night hang-out, for cocktails or a glass of excellent Spanish wine. </p> <p> <strong> La Vinya del Senyor</strong> <br> Pla\u00e7a Santa Maria 5 (Metro Jaume I) </p> <p> With more than 300 different bottles on its wine list, this is Barcelona's prime wine bar and it also boasts one of the most beautiful terraces, looking out over the grandiose Santa Maria del Mar church. Unlike a typical bodega, this is both chic and expensive, but the incredible choice of vintages - from all over the world - make La Vinya an indispensable stop for wine-lovers. It also has an inventive Asian chef who creates original tapas. </p> <p> <strong> El Xampanyet</strong> <br> Carrer Montcada 22 (Metro Jaume I) </p> <p> The Xampanyet (pronounced 'champanyet') is simply the greatest tapas bar in Barcelona. Just past the Picasso Museum, it has been in the friendly Esteve family for three generations. You may pop in just for a quick glass of cava, but be warned, you will end up staying an hour, as an irresistible stream of tapas start arriving - the best anchovies, tiny toasts with grilled peppers, spicy sausages and slices of Serrano ham. </p> <p> <strong> Gimlet</strong> <br> Carrer Rec 24 (Metro Jaume I) </p> <p> Gimlet is nothing less than a classic cocktail bar, oozing the kind of style and elegance you would usually find in downtown New York. It is not the easiest bar to find, with just a discreet neon sign outside. Walk in though and the atmosphere is immediately electric, the long wooden bar crowded with the hippest elements of Barcelona society, the statuesque barman calmly shaking a perfect cocktail. This is the preferred haunt for Barcelona bar owners to come to relax on their night off, enjoying a whisky sour, Manhattan or ultra-dry martini. There may be actors, artists, musicians or politicians, but this remains essentially an anonymous locale, where no one takes any notice of celebrities, even if Pedro Almod\u00f3var were to walk in. </p> <p><strong> Restaurants </strong></p> <p> <strong> Passeis del Pep</strong> <br> Pla\u00e7a de Palau 2 (Metro Barceloneta) </p> <p> It is difficult to find a better restaurant serving fish and sea food than the discreet but very smart Passeis del Pep. There is no sign on the street; gourmets in the know fol low a long corridor down the side of a Caixa bank and a door at the end suddenly opens out into an elegant dining room. There is no menu and no prices - this is not for budget watchers - but let yourself be guided through a wonderful meal by the knowledgeable waiters. If the season is right, do not miss the espardenyes , exquisite sea cucumbers. (Tel: 00 34 93 310 1021) </p> <p> <strong> Set Portes</strong> <br> Passeig Isabel II 14 </p> <p> If you are looking for one of the swish spots to watch Barcelona's movers and shakers making deals over a power lunch, then go no further than the famous 'Seven Doors'. Opened in 1836, the restaurant really does have seven doors - though only one is open as the entrance. This is one of the best places to come and try a classic paella, and although the atmosphere is pretty formal and booking essential, the prices are surprisingly reasonable. (Tel: 00 34 93 319 2950) </p> <p> <strong> Hofmann</strong> <br> Carrer Argenteria 74 (Metro Jaume I) </p> <p> The restaurant, run by charming female chef Mey Hof mann, should be an obligatory stop-off for any inquisitive gourmet. The elegant salon features a gastronomic menu of Catalan dishes, but the surprise here is that Hofmann also functions as a cooking school. Down on the street, just by the entrance, diners can see into the open kitchen where future chefs and enthusiastic amateurs are learning culinary skills. As some courses, such as for pastry (organised in conjunction with the famed Parisian patisserie, Lenotre), can be condensed into four or even two lessons, this can even become part of a holiday weekend. (Tel: 00 34 93 319 5889) </p> <p> <strong> El Foro Cafe</strong> <br> Carrer de la Princesa 52 (Metro Jaume I) </p> <p> The intriguing sign outside this cavernous new address reads: gastronomy, art and culture. It turns out to be a fair description of what is a very eclectic venue. Walk in during the day and you enter a busy caf\u00e9/restaurant, where the walls are decorated with bright contemporary art exhibitions. But turn up after midnight at the weekend and you will see most people disappearing down a flight of steps into the cellar that hosts the funky nightclub Galaxy, where the dancefloor is packed and the sound system blasts out the latest House music hits at high volume. </p> <p> <strong> Sandwich &amp; Friends</strong> <br> Passeig del Born 27 (Metro Jaume I) </p> <p> With its anglicised name and cosmopolitan cuisine, Sandwich &amp; Friends is pretty much a 'fast-food bodega'. But do not be put off, as it fits in perfectly with the fun, fashionable crowd drawn to the neighbourhood. For lunch, there is a big outdoor terrace right opposite the spare metal and glass construction that once housed Barcelona's main market, while at night the airy dining room is dominated by a huge, cartoon-like mural that could have come straight out of a Fellini movie. </p> <p><strong> After hours </strong></p> <p> <strong> Plastic Bar</strong> <br> Passeig del Born 19 (Metro Jaume I) </p> <p> Outrageous kitsch decor and punky barmen who specialise in lethal tequila slammers makes this bizarre new club one of the liveliest nightspots in town. The dance floor is minuscule, but that does not stop most customers abandoning their drinks on the bar, as the infectiously enthusiastic disc jockey manages to make most nights feel like a fun party. </p> <p> <strong> Woman Caballero</strong> <br> Estaci\u00f3 de Fran\u00e7a, Avenida Marqu\u00e8s de l'Argentera 6 (Metro Barceloneta) </p> <p> If you decide to sample only one club from Barcelona's diverse nocturnal scene, then it has to be the very hot Woman Caballero. This is not for the faint-hearted though, as doors do not even open till two in the morning, while the last clubbers stagger out about 9am. The location itself is original, as this maze-like subterranean club is beneath the grand train station, the Estaci\u00f3 de Fran\u00e7a - meaning that the station buffet is the perfect place for breakfast after a night of dancing. You can hop between three separate dance floors, each with a different ambience, dancers and music - funk, latin and techno. </p> <p> <strong> Borneo</strong> <br> Carrer Rec 49 (Metro Jaume I) </p> <p> Bars seem to open up every week in El Born and the names are confusing - Borne, Riborn, Born 21, Taverna del Born and Suborn to name just a few. So it should come as no surprise that Borneo is nothing to do with headhunters, but is rather a arty new nightclub, opposite Gimlet. The mood and accent here is jazz and, apart from the excellent mix played by the DJ, there are occasional live concerts. Borneo is a very laid-back place to end an evening's entertainment.</p>",

Vila Viniteca Carrer dels Agullers 7 Wine enthusiasts from all over Barcelona are drawn to this respected store, which has been a feature of the since 1932 and boasts the city's most extensive selection of wines. There is only a small sign on the street, but expect a shock as you walk in, coming face to face with thousands of different bottles stacked on top of each other. Shop assistants have to climb tall ladders then teeter along narrow ledges to reach the highest shelves. Saturday morning is a good time to visit, as there are often free tastings of Catalan vintages. Atalanta Manufactura Passeig del Born 10 Like many of the shops in El Born, Atalanta Manufactura is half-boutique, half-atelier, where you can watch artisans at work creating the merchandise on display. Here the speciality is hand-painted silks, linen and velvet, along with a small, offbeat selection of interior design objects. The genial owner will describe to you in delightful broken-English that the philosphy of her designs is seduction, but should you fail to be seduced then check out the shop next door, Rafa Teja Atelier, whose hand-painted cloth is more conventional. Nayamau Passeig del Born 12 Many passers-by walk straight past the messy workshop of interior designer Mauricio Gosalvez, but it serves as his shop too, and you will soon realise that many of the fashionable furniture and ornaments decorating El Born's trendy bars and restaurants are created here. Items like the pastel-coloured one-off lamps are small enough to take straight back home with you, but Gosalvez is also able to propose unique furniture designs to order. Bars and tapas Pitin Bar Passeig del Born 34 (Metro Jaume I) The area has only recently become the trendiest part of the city, but the friendly Pitin Bar has been an stylish outpost here for more than 20 years. Opened originally as a restaurant, it has been turned it into a cool bar and lounge by the owner's son Ram\u00f3n. It still serves light snacks and has a sunny terrace in the main square during the day, but it is best as a late-night hang-out, for cocktails or a glass of excellent Spanish wine. La Vinya del Senyor Pla\u00e7a Santa Maria 5 (Metro Jaume I) With more than 300 different bottles on its wine list, this is Barcelona's prime wine bar and it also boasts one of the most beautiful terraces, looking out over the grandiose Santa Maria del Mar church. Unlike a typical bodega, this is both chic and expensive, but the incredible choice of vintages - from all over the world - make La Vinya an indispensable stop for wine-lovers. It also has an inventive Asian chef who creates original tapas. El Xampanyet Carrer Montcada 22 (Metro Jaume I) The Xampanyet (pronounced 'champanyet') is simply the greatest tapas bar in Barcelona. Just past the Picasso Museum, it has been in the friendly Esteve family for three generations. You may pop in just for a quick glass of cava, but be warned, you will end up staying an hour, as an irresistible stream of tapas start arriving - the best anchovies, tiny toasts with grilled peppers, spicy sausages and slices of Serrano ham. Gimlet Carrer Rec 24 (Metro Jaume I) Gimlet is nothing less than a classic cocktail bar, oozing the kind of style and elegance you would usually find in downtown New York. It is not the easiest bar to find, with just a discreet neon sign outside. Walk in though and the atmosphere is immediately electric, the long wooden bar crowded with the hippest elements of Barcelona society, the statuesque barman calmly shaking a perfect cocktail. This is the preferred haunt for Barcelona bar owners to come to relax on their night off, enjoying a whisky sour, Manhattan or ultra-dry martini. There may be actors, artists, musicians or politicians, but this remains essentially an anonymous locale, where no one takes any notice of celebrities, even if Pedro Almod\u00f3var were to walk in. Restaurants Passeis del Pep Pla\u00e7a de Palau 2 (Metro Barceloneta) It is difficult to find a better restaurant serving fish and sea food than the discreet but very smart Passeis del Pep. There is no sign on the street; gourmets in the know fol low a long corridor down the side of a Caixa bank and a door at the end suddenly opens out into an elegant dining room. There is no menu and no prices - this is not for budget watchers - but let yourself be guided through a wonderful meal by the knowledgeable waiters. If the season is right, do not miss the espardenyes , exquisite sea cucumbers. (Tel: 00 34 93 310 1021) Set Portes Passeig Isabel II 14 If you are looking for one of the swish spots to watch Barcelona's movers and shakers making deals over a power lunch, then go no further than the famous 'Seven Doors'. Opened in 1836, the restaurant really does have seven doors - though only one is open as the entrance. This is one of the best places to come and try a classic paella, and although the atmosphere is pretty formal and booking essential, the prices are surprisingly reasonable. (Tel: 00 34 93 319 2950) Hofmann Carrer Argenteria 74 (Metro Jaume I) The restaurant, run by charming female chef Mey Hof mann, should be an obligatory stop-off for any inquisitive gourmet. The elegant salon features a gastronomic menu of Catalan dishes, but the surprise here is that Hofmann also functions as a cooking school. Down on the street, just by the entrance, diners can see into the open kitchen where future chefs and enthusiastic amateurs are learning culinary skills. As some courses, such as for pastry (organised in conjunction with the famed Parisian patisserie, Lenotre), can be condensed into four or even two lessons, this can even become part of a holiday weekend. (Tel: 00 34 93 319 5889) El Foro Cafe Carrer de la Princesa 52 (Metro Jaume I) The intriguing sign outside this cavernous new address reads: gastronomy, art and culture. It turns out to be a fair description of what is a very eclectic venue. Walk in during the day and you enter a busy caf\u00e9/restaurant, where the walls are decorated with bright contemporary art exhibitions. But turn up after midnight at the weekend and you will see most people disappearing down a flight of steps into the cellar that hosts the funky nightclub Galaxy, where the dancefloor is packed and the sound system blasts out the latest House music hits at high volume. Sandwich &amp; Friends Passeig del Born 27 (Metro Jaume I) With its anglicised name and cosmopolitan cuisine, Sandwich &amp; Friends is pretty much a 'fast-food bodega'. But do not be put off, as it fits in perfectly with the fun, fashionable crowd drawn to the neighbourhood. For lunch, there is a big outdoor terrace right opposite the spare metal and glass construction that once housed Barcelona's main market, while at night the airy dining room is dominated by a huge, cartoon-like mural that could have come straight out of a Fellini movie. After hours Plastic Bar Passeig del Born 19 (Metro Jaume I) Outrageous kitsch decor and punky barmen who specialise in lethal tequila slammers makes this bizarre new club one of the liveliest nightspots in town. The dance floor is minuscule, but that does not stop most customers abandoning their drinks on the bar, as the infectiously enthusiastic disc jockey manages to make most nights feel like a fun party. Woman Caballero Estaci\u00f3 de Fran\u00e7a, Avenida Marqu\u00e8s de l'Argentera 6 (Metro Barceloneta) If you decide to sample only one club from Barcelona's diverse nocturnal scene, then it has to be the very hot Woman Caballero. This is not for the faint-hearted though, as doors do not even open till two in the morning, while the last clubbers stagger out about 9am. The location itself is original, as this maze-like subterranean club is beneath the grand train station, the Estaci\u00f3 de Fran\u00e7a - meaning that the station buffet is the perfect place for breakfast after a night of dancing. You can hop between three separate dance floors, each with a different ambience, dancers and music - funk, latin and techno. Borneo Carrer Rec 49 (Metro Jaume I) Bars seem to open up every week in El Born and the names are confusing - Borne, Riborn, Born 21, Taverna del Born and Suborn to name just a few. So it should come as no surprise that Borneo is nothing to do with headhunters, but is rather a arty new nightclub, opposite Gimlet. The mood and accent here is jazz and, apart from the excellent mix played by the DJ, there are occasional live concerts. Borneo is a very laid-back place to end an evening's entertainment.",

'I think so,' says Adams of his likely retirement in 18 months' time, at the end of his newly-negotiated contract with Arsenal, by which time he will be 35. </p> <p>'Although ending my international career may open things up,' he adds, 'I may find that with the amount of time that I have to recover, I'll be able to go on for longer.' In his attempt to extend his Arsenal career, Adams is likely to take international weeks as rest periods, rather than join the England squad in any coaching capacity, as has been suggested. When his playing days do end, he says, he will first take time out of the game for a rest and to spend more time with his young family before considering whether to go into coaching or management. </p> <p>'I do feel knowledge is to be passed on,' he says. 'And I do feel I have got a lot to offer. 'I'm not going to be egotistical and say I could jump into the Arsenal job. Maybe I need to learn, to get my coaching badge, to have a look around at a few clubs, to manage a small club. A lot goes into it. But yes, I could do it. The idea does appeal, and I'm not going to rule that out.' </p> <p>England, he says, is a different matter but he would still consider joining the set-up. 'There's a lot of things go into the England job. If I could influence the media, the structure and politics of the industry, then you never know. I don't rule it out, either.' Long before then, Adams insists that there are still trophies left to be won in his final 18 months with Arsenal. 'I've never been a fading-out kind of guy,' he says. </p> <p>He explains why the team has been under-achieving and how he believes it is turning around. He also outlines how he is grooming Patrick Vieira to replace him as captain. Alongside the football and then beyond, Adams also expects to be kept busy with his addiction treatment centre, which is nearly ready to take its first patients. He is close to finding a property for the 16-bed centre, which will be a non profit-making charity, open to all sportsmen and women who believe they need help for any addictive illness, be it drink, drugs or gambling. Adams - now into the fifth year of his own recovery from alcoholism - has professionals currently working on the project, and counselling could be available from April ahead of the centre's proposed opening in June. </p> <p>'The aim is to give a chance to sporting people, retired or active, to get the best available therapy,' says Adams. 'I think back to that time when for me there seemed nowhere to go. In this country there is still a lot of shame about the illness. People think you are weak-willed. But I know it took enormous courage for me to accept my alcoholism.' </p>",

      "body": "<p>First, and by chance, I met a young guide called Amr, a tall, thin village boy with a beige galabiyya and brown knitted cap. Then Amr found me a brown donkey, which he tied up beside his own. </p> <p>We shared black tea and pleasantries in the shade of a date palm and then headed out of the valley into the desert. </p> <p>The transition from lush garden to arid waste was easy and abrupt. At the edge of the desert the going was firm, the grey wilderness more rock than sand. The late-morning sun struck like an iron and flattened out the creases from the landscape. The donkeys made a special, plaintive wheeze as if begging to be anywhere but there, but they did not once turn around, as I did, to gaze wistfully at the Nile valley of Middle Egypt, almost fluorescent green in this light. Its promise of comfort tormented me like the thought of paradise to a troubled soul. </p> <p>As we got into our stride, Amr brought out a white keffiyeh and wrapped it round his ears. He shuffled further back on his donkey to let his feet swing loose and when he was sitting comfortably, he began to sing about Antar, one of the great and legendary Arab heroes. </p> <p>' Then Antar rode across the desert </p> <p>And rushed into the fight </p> <p>His sword raised above his head _' </p> <p> He lifted the meagre bamboo he carried as a crop and sliced through the thick air. Don Quixote could have done no better. </p> <p>The bamboo lisped, imaginary heads rolled and the wheezing donkeys, fearing the worst, picked up their pace, just a little, just for a moment, until the heat melted the edge off their urgency. </p> <p>We were climbing a gentle incline out of the valley and as we put some distance between ourselves and the fertile land, as we got the overview, it became easy to establish the cardinal points of Egypt. </p> <p>The Nile arrives in Egypt from Sudan in the south and runs more or less due north to its end in the Mediterranean. The sun comes out of the desert in the east and disappears into the desert to the west. </p> <p>Seen like this, the land is in a perfect and harmonious relationship with sunlight and water. Almost wherever you are you can trace the movement of the river and the sun and find that you are at the crossroads of the essentials of life. </p> <p>No wonder ancient Egyp tians made gods of these elements and Ra, the sun-god, lorded over all. </p> <p>The donkeys headed due east, towards a creamy limestone ridge. Even from the river I had been able to make out the line of incisions in the hillside. To the south, signs of a limestone quarry. To the north there were the ancient tombs of Beni Hassan, famous for their terrace with a remarkable view across the valley to the Libyan Desert and for their images of hunting and wrestling, reminders that people who lived long ago enjoyed many of the things we do today. </p> <p>Amr led us straight ahead and continued to list the virtues of the great Antar. 'He could ride like the wind,' he sang. 'He could fight like the devil. He could love like a prince_' The song was incessant and pleading and, as with so many things in Egypt, the longer it continued, the more it began to take on religious significance, a suitable accompaniment for our entry into the hills. </p> <p>We rode up a ravine and passed the entrances to a string of ancient tombs. Amr slowed and leaned forward on his donkey, as though he was going to get down. This, he explained, was where other foreigners he had taken had wanted to get down. But I was too excited and too happy to stop there and we rode on to the place I had come to see, the temple of Pasht, Speos Artemidos, which Amr, like many Egyptians, called 'the stable of Antar'. </p> <p>The 'stable' was fronted by a portico of stone pillars, two rows of four. The portico was cut out of the rock, the chamber beyond cut into it, a sudden order and symmetry imposed long ago on the random chaos of nature, its significance lost, its form all that is left to us. Egyptologists use the name the Greeks gave the place - Speos Artemidos, 'the Grotto of Artemis', the goddess of hunting - but the temple was already old when the Greeks arrived. Their allusion to hunting would have been appropriate because the area was rich in wildlife, and even as recently as 150 years ago there were still crocodiles to chase this far north. </p> <p>I looked around. The desert is deceptive. At first sight it seems empty, but if you stand still, signs of life often begin to emerge, a bird dashing from cover, insects underfoot, small rodents scuffling about. Here, near the grotto dedicated to the Greek goddess of hunting, only flies buzzed around the donkeys. </p> <p>The little temple was built about 3,500 years ago, when wildlife was so abundant and so threatening that it made sense to worship animals as gods. Its foundation details are lost - why it was built here and who commissioned it - but it was dedicated to the ancient lion goddess Pasht. 'Long time ago,' Amr explained as we got closer, 'they found mummified lions and cats buried in deep holes near here.' I was going to ask if people were still finding things, if they were still looking, but he held up a hand to silence me and pointed ahead to some donkeys tied up near the temple. </p> <p>The donkeys were a disappointment. One of the reasons I had made the journey was that I had been told I would have the place to myself, but here were some tourists, perhaps, or officials from the antiquity service. </p> <p>Amr thought otherwise. He put a long, slender finger to his lips. 'Wait here. I will go to look.' </p> <p>Life being strange and wonderful, it occurred to me that maybe we had found the hideout of thieves or hashish smugglers - Ali Baba transported to the banks of the Nile. This I wasn't going to miss. My heels touched the donkey's spare ribs. 'I'm coming with you.' </p> <p>We left our donkeys tied near the others and walked across the dusty ground as far as the portico, as far as the images of the lion goddess carved on to walls. The temple - think more of a shrine than of the grandeur of Luxor - was gloomy inside after the desert brilliance, but there was no mistaking the two men coming out towards us. </p> <p>Amr offered greetings. There was a touch of menace about the response. While Amr talked, I looked behind the men and saw a woman in the little chamber. </p> <p>She was dressed in black and merged into the gloom, so it was impossible to see clearly, but she was certainly alone, down on the ground, and she appeared to be rolling across the sand and rock, moving from side to side. I heard her talking, confiding, moaning, softly pleading. </p> <p>One of the men stood in front of me to block the view. </p> <p>'Please,' Amr said, 'it is not possible for us to stay here right now. We must come back another time.' </p> <p>My first thought was that this was Amr's elaborate way of getting paid for a second ride and I was going to object, but he took me by the arm and led me out of the portico. </p> <p>'Why can't we go in?' </p> <p>'This woman wants to have a baby but she cannot,' he said as plainly as if he had been talking about fixing her washing machine. 'So she has come here for it to be possible.' </p> <p>'Why here?' </p> <p>'Because here there is baraka , blessing.' </p> <p>The story, the way Amr explained it as we rode back down into the green valley, was simple. The woman was from a nearby village, had had difficulty in getting pregnant and had visited her sheikh and the doctor. Pills, potions and prayers but still nothing had happened. </p> <p>So now she was placing her faith in the old stones and had come to pray to Pasht to bless her with a child. </p> <p>'Now she will be OK,' Amr assured me as he used his bamboo to fence with my donkey's tail. </p> <p>'Why?' </p> <p>' Allah karim .

      "bodyText": "First, and by chance, I met a young guide called Amr, a tall, thin village boy with a beige galabiyya and brown knitted cap. Then Amr found me a brown donkey, which he tied up beside his own. We shared black tea and pleasantries in the shade of a date palm and then headed out of the valley into the desert. The transition from lush garden to arid waste was easy and abrupt. At the edge of the desert the going was firm, the grey wilderness more rock than sand. The late-morning sun struck like an iron and flattened out the creases from the landscape. The donkeys made a special, plaintive wheeze as if begging to be anywhere but there, but they did not once turn around, as I did, to gaze wistfully at the Nile valley of Middle Egypt, almost fluorescent green in this light. Its promise of comfort tormented me like the thought of paradise to a troubled soul. As we got into our stride, Amr brought out a white keffiyeh and wrapped it round his ears. He shuffled further back on his donkey to let his feet swing loose and when he was sitting comfortably, he began to sing about Antar, one of the great and legendary Arab heroes. ' Then Antar rode across the desert And rushed into the fight His sword raised above his head _' He lifted the meagre bamboo he carried as a crop and sliced through the thick air. Don Quixote could have done no better. The bamboo lisped, imaginary heads rolled and the wheezing donkeys, fearing the worst, picked up their pace, just a little, just for a moment, until the heat melted the edge off their urgency. We were climbing a gentle incline out of the valley and as we put some distance between ourselves and the fertile land, as we got the overview, it became easy to establish the cardinal points of Egypt. The Nile arrives in Egypt from Sudan in the south and runs more or less due north to its end in the Mediterranean. The sun comes out of the desert in the east and disappears into the desert to the west. Seen like this, the land is in a perfect and harmonious relationship with sunlight and water. Almost wherever you are you can trace the movement of the river and the sun and find that you are at the crossroads of the essentials of life. No wonder ancient Egyp tians made gods of these elements and Ra, the sun-god, lorded over all. The donkeys headed due east, towards a creamy limestone ridge. Even from the river I had been able to make out the line of incisions in the hillside. To the south, signs of a limestone quarry. To the north there were the ancient tombs of Beni Hassan, famous for their terrace with a remarkable view across the valley to the Libyan Desert and for their images of hunting and wrestling, reminders that people who lived long ago enjoyed many of the things we do today. Amr led us straight ahead and continued to list the virtues of the great Antar. 'He could ride like the wind,' he sang. 'He could fight like the devil. He could love like a prince_' The song was incessant and pleading and, as with so many things in Egypt, the longer it continued, the more it began to take on religious significance, a suitable accompaniment for our entry into the hills. We rode up a ravine and passed the entrances to a string of ancient tombs. Amr slowed and leaned forward on his donkey, as though he was going to get down. This, he explained, was where other foreigners he had taken had wanted to get down. But I was too excited and too happy to stop there and we rode on to the place I had come to see, the temple of Pasht, Speos Artemidos, which Amr, like many Egyptians, called 'the stable of Antar'. The 'stable' was fronted by a portico of stone pillars, two rows of four. The portico was cut out of the rock, the chamber beyond cut into it, a sudden order and symmetry imposed long ago on the random chaos of nature, its significance lost, its form all that is left to us. Egyptologists use the name the Greeks gave the place - Speos Artemidos, 'the Grotto of Artemis', the goddess of hunting - but the temple was already old when the Greeks arrived. Their allusion to hunting would have been appropriate because the area was rich in wildlife, and even as recently as 150 years ago there were still crocodiles to chase this far north. I looked around. The desert is deceptive. At first sight it seems empty, but if you stand still, signs of life often begin to emerge, a bird dashing from cover, insects underfoot, small rodents scuffling about. Here, near the grotto dedicated to the Greek goddess of hunting, only flies buzzed around the donkeys. The little temple was built about 3,500 years ago, when wildlife was so abundant and so threatening that it made sense to worship animals as gods. Its foundation details are lost - why it was built here and who commissioned it - but it was dedicated to the ancient lion goddess Pasht. 'Long time ago,' Amr explained as we got closer, 'they found mummified lions and cats buried in deep holes near here.' I was going to ask if people were still finding things, if they were still looking, but he held up a hand to silence me and pointed ahead to some donkeys tied up near the temple. The donkeys were a disappointment. One of the reasons I had made the journey was that I had been told I would have the place to myself, but here were some tourists, perhaps, or officials from the antiquity service. Amr thought otherwise. He put a long, slender finger to his lips. 'Wait here. I will go to look.' Life being strange and wonderful, it occurred to me that maybe we had found the hideout of thieves or hashish smugglers - Ali Baba transported to the banks of the Nile. This I wasn't going to miss. My heels touched the donkey's spare ribs. 'I'm coming with you.' We left our donkeys tied near the others and walked across the dusty ground as far as the portico, as far as the images of the lion goddess carved on to walls. The temple - think more of a shrine than of the grandeur of Luxor - was gloomy inside after the desert brilliance, but there was no mistaking the two men coming out towards us. Amr offered greetings. There was a touch of menace about the response. While Amr talked, I looked behind the men and saw a woman in the little chamber. She was dressed in black and merged into the gloom, so it was impossible to see clearly, but she was certainly alone, down on the ground, and she appeared to be rolling across the sand and rock, moving from side to side. I heard her talking, confiding, moaning, softly pleading. One of the men stood in front of me to block the view. 'Please,' Amr said, 'it is not possible for us to stay here right now. We must come back another time.' My first thought was that this was Amr's elaborate way of getting paid for a second ride and I was going to object, but he took me by the arm and led me out of the portico. 'Why can't we go in?' 'This woman wants to have a baby but she cannot,' he said as plainly as if he had been talking about fixing her washing machine. 'So she has come here for it to be possible.' 'Why here?' 'Because here there is baraka , blessing.' The story, the way Amr explained it as we rode back down into the green valley, was simple. The woman was from a nearby village, had had difficulty in getting pregnant and had visited her sheikh and the doctor. Pills, potions and prayers but still nothing had happened. So now she was placing her faith in the old stones and had come to pray to Pasht to bless her with a child. 'Now she will be OK,' Amr assured me as he used his bamboo to fence with my donkey's tail. 'Why?' ' Allah karim . God is generous, ya Antoon ,' he replied, using the Coptic version of my name. 'But this is Pasht, the ancient goddess, or Antar, the Arab hero. This isn't Allah.' 'In my country, it is all the same, all Allah.' 'Do many women do this?' He looked at me in a way he hadn't before, with a touch of suspicion, and then looked ahead. 'Many women? Yes_ when they need to.' 'And what about men?' 'The men?' He turned away with magnificent disdain as though he could hardly believe I had asked such a dumb question. 'Antar never had trouble with his women.' Then he raised his stick and sliced the thick, hot air in two as though he was bringing the conversation to an end.

      "bodyText": "Holistic holidays have become hot property, according to Kuoni, Britain's largest long-haul tour operator. 'People want something extra in their lives,' said Sue Biggs, Kuoni managing director. 'They are looking for the spiritual side of life and want treatments and to experience other cultures.' This is reflected in the growing interest in spa holidays, alternative medicine - ayurvedic and homeopathic treatments - and alternative religions such as Buddhism. The choice of hotel can be as big a factor as the destination. Hotels like Dubai's spectacular Burj al Arab, which sits like a sail over the sea, the Aman Resorts in several Far Eastern countries and the rebuilt Sandy Lane in Barbados have become attractions in their own right. Thailand remained Kuoni's top-selling destination last year, growing by 12 per cent, thanks to late season special offers - and the downturn in Indonesia because of political unrest. Dubai was the fastest-growing destination with a 70 per cent increase in British visitors and more growth is forecast. Also on the list is India - though its government gets the 'killing the goose that laid the golden egg' award for dramatically increas ing the cost of admission to the Taj Mahal and other major attractions. Predicted hot spots for 2001 \u0095 Dubai: A truly twenty-first-century city with hotels that win design awards, clean, safe beaches and just six hours flying time. \u0095 United States: Tailor-made itineraries are ever-easier, thanks to latest technology. \u0095 India: A new wave of confidence and design consciousness is sweeping the country with exciting hotels opening. \u0095 Nepal: An attraction in its own right, the mountain kingdom gains too as a second centre for visitors to India. \u0095 Australia: Quickly recovered from post-Olympic blues. \u0095 Mexico: Some of the world's best sightseeing, plus fabulous Caribbean beaches. \u0095 Tanzania: The best game viewing in the world, new hotels and the exotic attractions of Zanzibar. \u0095 Vietnam: History ancient and modern, culture, great food and terrific beaches. \u0095 South Africa: Culture, game viewing, excellent wine and beaches. \u0095 Barbados: Could bounce back from the doldrums with the return of Sandy Lane and possibly Concorde. Kuoni's website has been upgraded to allow direct booking of 750 hotels and 150 tours in more than 50 destinations. Brochures from travel agents or call 0870 007 458664",

Admittedly it was down to my bad maths that my passport was three days short of the required six months' validity, but it was three days for goodness sake and, pleasant as the flight had been (as far as an 18-hour flight can be pleasant), I didn't fancy another one immediately. Nor, for the sake of five dollars, was I interested in a closer look at Indonesian judicial proceedings, so I gave in. As it turned out, his maths was as bad as mine; 'Five!' he hissed, frantically writing down 50. 'Welcome to Bali.' </p> <p>Before I got there, Bali had always conjured visions of smooth white beaches with frondy palms, packed with gap-year backpackers and Australian surfers in sarongs under a vast sky of stained-glass blue. Instead we landed through a layer of fat grey cloud and stepped out into a humidity that wrapped itself around your face like a wet scarf. 'It's the rainy season,' our guide explained cheerfully, and I couldn't help feeling slightly cheated; it had been the rainy season in London 18 hours and $50 ago. </p> <p>But once we left behind the honking traffic of Denpasar and walked into the marble foyer of the Oberoi Hotel, Bali began to live up to the clich\u00e9s. The rain had stopped and Wagnerian surf thundered on to the beach a few feet away from the open-air restaurant; it was still humid, but the air was full of the scent of flowers, the wind off the sea was sharp and the beers were stingingly cold. 'This is paradise,' someone observed, calling on all their imaginative resources. 'Wait till you see Lombok,' said John, the Oberoi's American manager. 'Lombok makes this look like New York City.' </p> <p>Bali is busy; you would not know it from inside the secluded grounds of the Oberoi - 15 acres of tropical flowers and private luxury villas, a huge pool, amphitheatre and its own stretch of beach - but the coastal resorts are becoming crammed with bars and nightclubs catering for the surfers and young travellers sporting henna tattoos and ethnic jewellery. Lombok, by contrast, is only two hours away by ferry but feels like a different coun try. Which, essentially, it is. The people of each island identify themselves firmly with their birthplace and local dialects differ significantly, though I had to take their word for this, as I managed only to learn the indispensable phrases 'bon appetit' and 'I love you'. </p> <p>But perhaps the most obvious difference is that of religion. Bali is the only Hindu island in Indonesia, though the culture is shot through with animism. Temples abound along the roadside, from the small ancestral ones of family homes to the large, ornate village temples, all facing north-east in the direction of the holy mountain. Driving through Bali on our first day, we noticed that the statues of the Hindu gods in the towns wore little skirts of black and white checked material, which reminded me of the time my granny knitted hats for the owls on her gatepost in winter, but apparently this symbolises the animist belief in the balance of good and evil. </p> <p>We spent a sticky, cloudy day in Bali trawling the craft markets of Ubud, once a hippy haven and now a shopping centre (though not in the Brent Cross sense) for those who want to haggle over the famous hand-made silver jewellery, local pearls and silk sarongs. This takes some practice: it's possible to spend half an hour debating the last few thousand rupia and getting quite irate when they won't back down, before a bit of effortful mental arithmetic reminds you that you're arguing over 5p. In the shade of the Njana Tilem Gallery, however, the extraordinary woodcarvings of Bali's most famous artist, Ida Bagus Tilem, sell for thousands of dollars to international collectors; towering, intricate depictions of Rama and Sita engulfed in flames, or a traditional fisherman hauling his catch in a net, each strand of which is exquisitely worked in ebony, hibiscus or frangipani. If you can't find the money, or the space on your coffee table, there's a selection of smaller animals that fit into your hand and cost only a few dollars. </p> <p>By some meteorological quirk, the rainy season seemed to apply exclusively to Bali, so that we arrived in Lombok in perfectly tropical weather. (Another tip: don't stand on deck on the ferry for two hours at midday with no sunscreen, however deceptively cool the breeze. There is not much ozone round here and it will hurt.) </p> <p>The Oberoi Lombok is possibly the most romantic place in the universe, and we understood immediately what John meant about the island's calm; inside the resort you can hear only the birds and the fountains, and on the roads you pass only pony carts and the odd moped, carrying the villagers to work in the paddy fields and cashew plantations. In the evenings, the calls of the muezzin carry distantly across the bay from the mosque. </p> <p>One of the advantages of staying at the Oberoi, apart from its obvious luxury, is that you can choose the pace of your holiday. We took a day trip to Sendaggita Waterfall, where the really adventurous can take an overnight trek up Mount Rinjani, the island's highest volcano (naturally, we didn't), and also visited a traditional Sasak village. We spent a morning snorkelling with giant turtles off the coast of the Gili Islands, and returned for Indonesian massages at the health spa, and finished our stay with a fresh seafood barbecue, with candlelit tables on the beach and traditional performances by local dancers and musicians while you eat. </p> <p>Lombok experienced a brief dip in popularity after the riots last year, but the hotels were not affected and we saw nothing to suggest any disruption to the island's tranquillity. This may change eventually, though not because of political unrest. At the moment there are restrictions on the building of resorts, and a large proportion of the island's income is still from agriculture. But tourism is always more lucrative, and the construction of a new golf course on the other side of the bay suggests that developers may not be far behind. Lombok really is the most unbelievably beautiful place on God's earth and, at the risk of flooding it with visitors, I insist you go there immediately, in case it should change in the future. Just remember to check your passport. </p> <p>\u0095 Stephanie Merritt was a guest at the Oberoi hotels in Bali and Lombok.

      "body": "<p>A simple wooden plaque at the entrance to the empty base station for the Kitzsteinhorn funicular train commemorates the 155 people who died in the blaze two months ago. Underneath the plaque mourners have left their own mementoes. Handwritten notes and soft toys have been placed alongside candles. People stand around in little groups talking quietly while others stare up the mountain towards the tunnel entrance. </p> <p>Only a few metres away hundreds of skiers are stepping off the bus and trooping up the hill to the other gateway to the Kitzsteinhorn glacier, the Panoramabahn cable car. Instead of a direct trip up in the train, skiers now have to take the eight- person cable car and then a chair lift before gaining access to the mountain's 40 kilometres of runs. </p> <p>When Kitzsteinhorn reopened for business on 7 December - 27 days after the accident - the lift company feared that few people would turn up. Instead staff were forced to turn skiiers away. 'They were coming to prove that they believed in us,' says Peter Pr\u00e4uuer, commercial director of the Gletscherbahnen Kaprun AG. 'After the accident we received hundreds of phone calls and letters from previous guests telling us that they were coming back.' </p> <p>But reopening day highlighted one of the key problems this season - capacity. Michael Strasser, director of the tourist office in neighbouring Zell Am See, says: 'The problems will come when there is little snow in Zell Am See and skiers are bused over to Kitzsteinhorn, which can cope with a third fewer skiers than usual because the funicular is shut.' </p> <p>Neilson, one of two main UK ski operators featuring Kaprun, says business is down 15 per cent for the resort this season while Zell Am See is up 15 per cent. Philip Poile, commercial director, says: 'I don't think the disaster is at the front of people's minds now. My main concern is the cable car issue and whether there will be big queues because of the capacity problems.' </p> <p>Hans Wallner, director of the Kaprun Tourist Office, says the problem is not so much getting people up the mountain but getting them all down at the end of the day. Instead of the maximum 10,000 passengers transported up the mountain every day, the tunnel's closure has reduced the capacity to 6,000. </p> <p>As news of the accident spread across the globe more than 700 journalists descended on the tiny village of Kaprun. 'It was not easy to handle for a village of only 3,000 inhabitants,' says Wallner. Kaprun lost six people in the fire, including an eight-year-old boy.

      "bodyText": "A simple wooden plaque at the entrance to the empty base station for the Kitzsteinhorn funicular train commemorates the 155 people who died in the blaze two months ago. Underneath the plaque mourners have left their own mementoes. Handwritten notes and soft toys have been placed alongside candles. People stand around in little groups talking quietly while others stare up the mountain towards the tunnel entrance. Only a few metres away hundreds of skiers are stepping off the bus and trooping up the hill to the other gateway to the Kitzsteinhorn glacier, the Panoramabahn cable car. Instead of a direct trip up in the train, skiers now have to take the eight- person cable car and then a chair lift before gaining access to the mountain's 40 kilometres of runs. When Kitzsteinhorn reopened for business on 7 December - 27 days after the accident - the lift company feared that few people would turn up. Instead staff were forced to turn skiiers away. 'They were coming to prove that they believed in us,' says Peter Pr\u00e4uuer, commercial director of the Gletscherbahnen Kaprun AG. 'After the accident we received hundreds of phone calls and letters from previous guests telling us that they were coming back.' But reopening day highlighted one of the key problems this season - capacity. Michael Strasser, director of the tourist office in neighbouring Zell Am See, says: 'The problems will come when there is little snow in Zell Am See and skiers are bused over to Kitzsteinhorn, which can cope with a third fewer skiers than usual because the funicular is shut.' Neilson, one of two main UK ski operators featuring Kaprun, says business is down 15 per cent for the resort this season while Zell Am See is up 15 per cent. Philip Poile, commercial director, says: 'I don't think the disaster is at the front of people's minds now. My main concern is the cable car issue and whether there will be big queues because of the capacity problems.' Hans Wallner, director of the Kaprun Tourist Office, says the problem is not so much getting people up the mountain but getting them all down at the end of the day. Instead of the maximum 10,000 passengers transported up the mountain every day, the tunnel's closure has reduced the capacity to 6,000. As news of the accident spread across the globe more than 700 journalists descended on the tiny village of Kaprun. 'It was not easy to handle for a village of only 3,000 inhabitants,' says Wallner. Kaprun lost six people in the fire, including an eight-year-old boy. Strasser adds: 'The villagers somehow felt guilty even though it wasn't their fault. We had to work hard to convince them that life goes on.' Kaprun's dependence on tourism was also highlighted by the accident. Many German skiers, who make up 36 per cent of Kaprun's 450,000 winter visitors, cancelled their holidays for the rest of November and bookings for the rest of the season tailed off. More than 80 per cent of the village's population works in the tourism industry, which lost an estimated \u00a370 million during the month-long closure.

The contingent risk is that you may suffer some catastrophic accident that renders you disabled or incapable. This may happen before you are old though it is much more likely when you are already old. A fifth of Britain's pensioners are incapable of looking after themselves; injury as much as infirmity is the cause.</p> <p>The philosophic and political question is how should society respond. The conservative view is that such risks should be each individual's responsibility, and that the only intervention by the state should be to underwrite the circumstances of the very poorest who simply do not have the wherewithal to look after themselves. The liberal view is that because old age is certain and the consequences of a catastrophic and unpredictable accident are just that - catastrophic and realistically uninsurable - then these are definitive areas where the responsibility should be collective. The division is decisive; it defines a crucial difference between Left and Right.</p> <p>In Britain the conservative view has held sway for 20 years. The large moral proposition about the superiority of individual responsibility has been supported by two important sub-propositions.</p> <p>The first is that the delivery of support for the elderly by the state is often inefficient, and is better performed by the private sector; even the state's 'promise' about providing a good pension is fragile and better respected by the private sector. The second is that the state cannot afford - given an increasingly ageing population - to undertake collective responsibility for personal care and guarantee the value of the basic state pension even if it wanted.</p> <p>We must abandon universal provision and substitute targeted, means-tested provision only for the very needy. Thus the state pension has been allowed to become worth progressively less, indexed only to the growth of prices generally rather than wages. A safety net, the Minimum Income Retirement Guarantee, is de facto replacing the universal provision element of the state pension, meaning that individuals, from young disabled to elderly, who need personal care have been means tested to ensure only the poor get their care paid for.</p> <p>But last Thursday came a crucial dent in the conservative consensus. Liberal Democrat members of the Scottish Executive, under pressure from their party in the Scottish Parliament, forced the Labour leader of the Executive and Scotland's First Minister, Henry McLeish, into an extraordinary U-turn. Scotland is now committed to the universal provision of free personal care for the elderly, and a study group is to report by August on how to proceed. Scotland is demonstrating that it belongs to the European liberal mainstream, and is declaring independence from conservative England. More ominously for New Labour, it is yet more evidence that the custodianship of Britain's progressive tradition is passing from them.</p> <p>For New Labour strongly and passionately disagrees with universal and collective provision for old age and its consequences. It is readier to build a stronger safety-net for low-income groups than the Tories would consider, but its position is conservative even if at the liberal end of that spectrum. It has refused to consider the central recommendation of the Royal Commission on Long Term Care for the elderly that it set up after the election: that personal care for the elderly should be provided by the state free of charge with only living or 'hotel' costs to be means-tested.</p> <p>Instead, in its new Health and Social Care Bill, New Labour wants to standardise nationally the current lottery of means-tested charging, currently varying between local authorities, and wind down a worthwhile universal basic state pension. In this area, Labour is becoming the party of One Nation conservatism. The Liberal Democrats are assuming the mantle of championing the liberal and centre-Left propositions on collective responsibility.</p> <p>The case for universal provision of free personal care for the elderly was made eloquently by the Royal Commission. 'Long term care,' it reported, 'is a contingency not a probability. Neither its incidence nor the scale of care needed are predictable. It is equitable and proper for the state to meet at least one element of the catastrophic costs for everyone. And the costs in the future in relation to people's likely means will remain catastrophic.' It rejected outright the notion that individuals could take responsibility for the cost of personal care that might follow a catastrophe, because this was not a risk the mainstream insurance industry was prepared to accept. Indeed, standard insurance for personal care in old age is prohibitively expensive.</p> <p>As for the argument about open-ended public expense with an ageing population, the Commission was simply scornful. It dismissed the widespread notion that the country is labouring under a demographic time bomb; Britain's pensioner population is growing, but not greatly in relation to the numbers of people of working age. In any case, the costs of providing long-term care for pensioners and the disabled are not great (\u00a3800 million to \u00a31,200m), and affordable if we choose.</p> <p>The report was completed before the emergence of a structural budget surplus, which further weakens the argument about unaffordability. The moral and practical imperative, the Commission felt, was to offer personal care free, with individuals still paying for living and housing costs while means-testing protected the poorest.</p> <p>In short, the key conservative arguments - individual responsibility, the relative efficiency of the private sector, the ageing population and the cost to the Exchequer - cut no ice. In this area the balance of the argument was to act collectively. Yet apart from some concessions on lifting the threshold of wealth before the means test applies, the Government has been stoutly opposed to any reform. But now it confronts the move in Scotland, which if it isn't fudged, is a direct challenge to its stance.</p> <p>In my view, the argument extends to the basic old-age pension. The state 'pension promise' has not been solid. But then the private sector-pension 'promise' is a lot less solid than the propaganda assumes, being subject to the vagaries of stock-market performance, annuity rates and, as 900,000 holders of Equitable Life pension plans found out, to pension fund mismanagement.</p> <p>What future pensioners need is neither to be wholly reliant on the state nor on the market, but to have their risks balanced. Just as everyone has the right to free universal personal care, so everyone has the right to a solid universal state pension whose level is automatically linked to the rise in general living standards. We should rely on a combination of our savings, our employers' pension scheme and a good state pension for income in old age - and not try to pretend that the private sector provides a free option.</p> <p>Because it doesn't. The Government may boast about healthy public finances, but if the consequence is to displace risk on to those incapable of accepting it then the boast is hollow. Universal personal care and a universal state pension are hallmarks of a society that understands the limits of individual responsibility. Congratulations to Scotland's Liberal Democrats. Without them the proposition would be dead. And welcome devolution.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Scottish Executive's promise to bring forward proposals to provide free and universal personal care for the elderly has drawn a predictable response from bilious commentators who see this as yet another example of favoured treatment north of the Border. This attitude betrays a misunderstanding of devolution. The Scottish Parliament has been given the power to allocate its block grant according to its own priorities. There is something comical, therefore, in the cries of horror at the possibility that it might choose to do so. There remain genuine worries about whether there is enough money in the pot. The Executive's promise, forced out of Labour at the end of Thursday's debate by its Lib Dem coalition partners and some of its own backbenchers, was opaque. A study group, surely otiose after the Sutherland Royal Commission, will report in August and proposals will then set out the costs and implications of the change. In plain language, this means that the issue has been kicked into touch until after a general election. It also implies that means-testing will remain part of Labour's preferences and that the coalition will face hard choices. The talk of 'efficiency' savings begins to smack of desperation. First Minister Henry McLeish has been remarkably determined that the Scottish Parliament should find its own way forward, but even his friends fear he may have been a little too bullish, raising false expectations. He also faces the hostility of his old friend and protector, Gordon Brown, who has set his face against the concession in England. Let's hope Henry's got it right. This is a desirable measure which England and Wales should seek to emulate rather than denounce.",

Burnt black by the sun, strewn with meteorites, it stretched towards the hazy Jbel Bani mountain range where we'd take the low road into the Sahara proper, the one with sand. After three days on the flat, we were still walking towards the mountains. Brahim, our guide, told us that only by experiencing the hammada (stony desert) would we truly appreciate the dunes. That night, a herd of 150 goats tiptoed past my tent in the twilight - 600 little hooves hitting the rubbly ground like soft rain. </p> <p>We'd driven south from Marrakesh, through a High Atlas mist, down to the village of Ait-Benhaddouh which has made a mint from its lovely old kasbah used in Lawrence of Arabia and Gladiator. Locals have a signed photo of Russell Crowe in their living room next to the one of King Muhammad VI. Further down the Dra Valley we passed somewhere called Tizi-n-Tinififft and spent two days buying carpets in the sacred town of Tamgrout. Soon after, the road runs out at Algeria. </p> <p>It was November (hot days, chilly nights) and I was on a new two-week trek of southern Morocco - first the Sahara, then the Anti-Atlas mountains - co-run by Englishman John-Paul Rodgers from the middle of Derbyshire and guide Brahim Elaabdouli. A history graduate from a remote Berber mountain village, Brahim was Mr Itinerary by day, wide-eyed storyteller by night. </p> <p>On a Moroccan trek, everybody smokes, hospitality knows no bounds and speed is not of the essence. Dawn turned to late morning by the time Ali and Aziz, gorgeous in sky-blue robes, had found the camels (they wander off in the night); coaxed them, loaded them with our food, water and camping gear ('hoosh' = up, 'toosh' = down) and we could finally set off - Arab, the strongest, followed by Bakher, Saharawi and Peter, the naughty one. Soon it was time for lunch, thrown together behind a thorn tree by Brahim's brother Muhammad; spicy omelette with lime, fried aubergines, tomato and coriander salad; coffee, dates, oranges. Before you knew it, it was time to set up camp again. You bring your own tent; they provide mattresses, blankets, pillows, flowery sheets...</p> <p>Walking with camels is oddly relaxing, their piled-high bodies rocking gently back and forth, the soft, heart-shaped soles of their big feet slopping along like old slippers. I never saw our camels spit. They did smell, but so did we. Convoys of silver Land-Cruisers sped Europeans over the mountains to their ready-made five-star bivouacs. We were evolving into scenery: unclean, unrecognisable (a definite plus) in turban-style sashes, and adept at giving each other privacy when nature called over the parched emptiness. It hasn't rained for three years, and how the true nomads out here survive, hurrying into nowhere with goats and toddlers, their colourful laundry hanging in the trees, is hard to imagine - though in the desert, everyone shares. A quiet man in his thirties came over for aspirin for his little girl who had a fever, and stayed all evening; on the menu, Muhammad's prune and lamb tagine and fresh bread, baked in the sand under hot embers. And so we whiled away another starry night with brain-teasers, jokes about circumcision, the one about the chicken who goes from Chigaga to Casablanca, each punchline repeated four times (English, French, Arabic, Berber) and still getting laughs. </p> <p>On the last night in the desert we finally camped in the big dunes. Scrabbling up 40ft sand castles, I regressed to the age of six; but there was something X-rated about the way the rising sun slowly found each dune's perfect rumps and hollows and the sand blushed into life. Later, the enormous guilt factor of teetering up an immaculate whiplash curve like a drunk gymnast, one foot slipping into hot orange sand, the other into silky shadow, crimping as you go. Given how long we'd spent getting here, it was a miracle nobody had done it before me. </p> <p>A strong selling point of this journey is the chance to dip a toe in two Moroccan cultures. We said goodbye to the camels, Ali and Aziz, then drove sadly by 4x4 over an enormous dry lake bed, once the main source of water for 40-camel caravans heading north, the only water left now a mirage. </p> <p>'Where have you come from?' asked a soldier who had stopped us. So close to the Algerian border, the military are sensitive, and have built pastel-pink fortresses. That was his first question. The second was, 'Do you have a cigarette?' Twenty kilometres on, we were at the foot of the mountains in Tata - little more than a souk in the Seventies but, after the hammada, almost cosmopolitan. Blue-tiled colonnades; fluorescent-lit shops selling one thing: buttons, drainpipes, eggs. Next door, chickens killed while you wait. We left a trail of sand through the foyer of the friendly Renaissance hotel, where businessmen were watching Morocco v Libya in the Africa Cup. We hadn't had a shower since Marrakesh seven days ago. </p> <p>Tata's rush hour is a school one: young boys cycling in tandem with their arms round each other; groups of girls in jeans and headscarves. By 8.40 it was over and all you could hear was wood pigeons again. Many women here wear European-style clothes; just as many keep fully veiled, and when they meet in the street, kiss each other's hands, then their own, in a traditional mark of respect. Brahim had planned for us to drive up into the Anti-Atlas mountains in the dark, then climb with torches to our first bivouac so we would be amazed by the view when we unzipped our tents in the morning. </p> <p>This was where Brahim and Muhammad grew up, in a white village perched over a valley of apricots, almonds, pomegranates and chocolate. An Eden that got a road seven years ago, where they speak Berber, not French or Arabic; write grafitti in squashed olives; and where Brahim's mum met us at the door with marigolds and sweet thyme, a symbol of love and welcome. We did an easy two-day circuit through rocky valleys with astonishing acoustics: in a narrow mountain pass, our four donkeys set each other off on an orgy of braying that echoed and amplified round into the next valley; here, skirting a steep drop, you could hear a spoon in a sauce-pan in the village opposite. </p> <p>And on Sunday morning, I woke on a green valley floor with the sun streaming in, to the heavenly stereo of three young women singing on one slope, two on the other side - a plaintive song about collecting wood by the river and asking Allah to help, belted out over the sound of their axes as they collected prickly firewood, the odd rebel yell thrown in.</p> <p><strong>Factfile</strong></p> <p>Carol McDaid travelled with Equatorial Travel.

This was where Brahim and Muhammad grew up, in a white village perched over a valley of apricots, almonds, pomegranates and chocolate. An Eden that got a road seven years ago, where they speak Berber, not French or Arabic; write grafitti in squashed olives; and where Brahim's mum met us at the door with marigolds and sweet thyme, a symbol of love and welcome. We did an easy two-day circuit through rocky valleys with astonishing acoustics: in a narrow mountain pass, our four donkeys set each other off on an orgy of braying that echoed and amplified round into the next valley; here, skirting a steep drop, you could hear a spoon in a sauce-pan in the village opposite. And on Sunday morning, I woke on a green valley floor with the sun streaming in, to the heavenly stereo of three young women singing on one slope, two on the other side - a plaintive song about collecting wood by the river and asking Allah to help, belted out over the sound of their axes as they collected prickly firewood, the odd rebel yell thrown in.

      "body": "<p>About a third of the world's people have TB bacilli in their bodies, but the bacterium is indolent. It multiplies into lung-consuming, bone-eating illness in only 10 per cent of the infected. People who live in crowded peasant huts and prisons and homeless shelters and slums stand the best chances of inhaling TB bacilli, of having the infection expand into active disease, and also, in some settings, of contracting or generating drug-resistant strains. A person with active disease who receives only one anti-TB drug, or who receives several for too short a time, can become a site of rapid bacterial evolution. The drugs apply the selective pressure. The host winds up sick with bacilli immune to those drugs, then coughs them up for others to share. This occurs infrequently in places of nearly universal poverty such as Haiti, where most people don't get treated at all, and most often in places where wealth and poverty are mingled, where the poor receive some therapy but not enough - places such as New York City, Peru and post-Soviet Russia.</p> <p>Farmer was obliged to go to Moscow because five years ago an old friend of his, a priest named Father Jack, had died of drug-resistant tuberculosis. It seemed that he must have caught it while working in Carabayllo, a slum on the outskirts of Lima. Farmer and a close friend and colleague named Jim Yong Kim - a fellow doctor from Harvard and the executive director of Partners in Health - went to the shantytown and, sure enough, discovered an epidemic of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) TB.</p> <p>The patients they found in Carabayllo - about 50, initially - were mainly young, and all were poor. Most had severely damaged lungs. Partners in Health had already helped finance a small clinic in the shantytown, and a good doctor was on hand, but cures would be difficult. Many of the workers were terrified of inhaling the drug-resistant germs. Farmer and Kim would have to arrange to feed the patients, in order to strengthen their immune systems. They'd have to arrange for laboratory analysis of each patient's TB, so that they'd know which antibiotics to use. Because most patients had TB resistant to all five of the best drugs, they'd have to give them 'second-line' antibiotics.</p> <p>In short, they'd have to build a first-rate health-care system out of the shantytown's mediocre one - a system that would administer those drugs reliably and keep the patients' spirits up, because the second-line drugs are weak and have unpleasant side effects, which a patient has to endure for as much as two years. Moreover, the second-line drugs were little used and very expensive, and Farmer and Kim didn't know where they'd find the money to buy them and they had no chance of getting money from foundations, because the World Health Organisation (WHO) had declared projects like theirs too expensive for 'resource-poor settings'.</p> <p>The WHO had created a program for worldwide TB control called Dots (Directly Observed Therapy Short Course). Properly applied, Dots ensures that patients take regular doses of the cheap and powerful first-line antibiotics for six to eight months. Dots worked well in most places. Farmer had used the programme for years in Haiti, even back before it had a name. It was inexpensive. It was all that poor countries could afford. Therefore, the policymakers reasoned, it had to be sufficient, even in settings where first-line-drug-resistance had surfaced.</p> <p>Farmer and Kim had some allies. The most powerful was Howard Hiatt, the former dean of the Harvard School of Public Health. He watched their project in Peru, a little nervously, from a distance. For a time, he wondered where they were getting the money for the second-line drugs. Then one day the president of the Brigham and Women's Hospital stopped him in a corridor and said, 'Your friends Farmer and Kim are in trouble with me. They owe this hospital $92,000.' Hiatt looked into the matter: 'Sure enough. They would stop at the pharmacy before they left for Peru and fill their briefcases with drugs.' Looking back, Hiatt was amused. 'That's their Robin Hood attitude.'</p> <p>Actually, they only borrowed the drugs. A Boston developer, Tom White, the chief donor to all their causes, soon wrote a check for the entire bill.</p> <p>It took Farmer about 22 hours to travel between Cange and Carabayllo and back again. Over the next three years, he made the journey 50 times. Kim went almost as often. 'Peru nearly killed us,' Farmer said later - and it was literally true in his case, when he came down with hepatitis A and ignored the symptoms for a time. But the results were very good. Indeed, 'astonishing' to Hiatt.</p> <p>'Paul and Jim mobilised the world to accept drug-resistant TB as a soluble problem,' Hiatt says, looking back. 'At least 2m people a year die of TB, more adults than from any other infectious disease. And when those people who die include predominantly people with drug-resistant strains, as will happen unless a very big and good programme gets established, it's not going to be 2m.'</p> <p>Many other meetings and arguments followed, but after that one a general strategy for treating MDR officially existed, and was endorsed by the WHO - a strategy like the one Farmer and Kim had used. It even had a name: Dots-Plus. With help from Hiatt, and later from others as well, Kim worked to reduce the prices of the second-line drugs. But Peru had drained about a $1m a year from their treasury - all the money they'd hoped to save as an endowment for Partners in Health.</p> <p>Farmer asked for help from the Open Society Institute (OSI), George Soros's foundation. The OSI turned him down, but sent him a letter of recommendation. It said that the OSI understood the importance of his and Kim's work in Peru, because the OSI had a similar project in Russia. Farmer knew about the TB epidemic in Russia, of course. It had arisen in the turmoil that followed the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The troubles contained ingredients not just for an epidemic but for a drug-resistant epidemic: a failing health-care system, a rising crime rate. Farmer knew that Soros had put up $12.5m for a pilot project to improve TB control in Russia. But Farmer hadn't known the details until he saw the letter. The OSI would use the Dots strategy. It would treat all patients as if they had nonresistant, pan-susceptible TB, and for those who didn't get better it would provide hospice care to ease their deaths.</p> <p>Farmer was appalled. With Hiatt's blessing, he wrote a two-page letter to the OSI, explaining that its project was bound to fail.</p> <p>In the event, Farmer ended up in George Soros's office. Soros shouted over the phone at the director of his project, Alex Goldfarb, for a while, in Farmer's presence. Then he asked Farmer to help fix the pilot project. Farmer wavered. Haiti needed him more. But his basic impulse was to say, 'You can't just let a poor person die,' and here he thought he saw a chance to apply this creed on every level.</p> <p>So Farmer took a trip to Siberia with Goldfarb. They returned as friends. What they saw in the overcrowded prisons alarmed Farmer. He and Goldfarb went to see Soros to ask for more money. Soros said that would just delay the international response. Instead, he arranged a meeting at the White House, with Hillary Clinton presiding. Farmer and Goldfarb helped write the talking points for Soros and critiqued the ones prepared for the First Lady. She prevailed upon the World Bank to take action, and the World Bank dispatched something called a mission to Moscow, a group of economists, epidemiologists, and public-health experts who would work out the details of a TB loan to Russia.</p> <p>This mission to Moscow was a good example of what Farmer meant when he said that in Areas of Moral Clarity only the imperative to take action is clear. He represented the World Bank on the problem of TB in Russian prisons. Goldfarb represented the Russian Ministry of Justice, which ran the prisons. The Ministry of Health, in charge of the civilian sector, felt it should receive the great majority of whatever money was loaned. Some of the World Bank consultants agreed. But nearly half of all cases and most of the drug-resistant ones languished in the prisons. So he and Goldfarb thought the Ministry of Justice should get half the loan. The mixture seemed combustible: World Bank consultants mixed with Russian colonels and generals and former members of a defeated empire, on the look out for condescension.</p> <p>Farmer had flown to Russia four times already on this business, and he was tired of it, he said. Tired of the meetings and arguments in rooms that grew increasingly airless, where there were no patients, his thoughts straying back to Haiti: when the next meningitis victim came in, would the doctors, in his absence, do a spinal tap? Tired physically, too, just then. Our first morning in Moscow, he said at breakfast, 'I'm still biologically deranged.' He wore his third and last shirt. One of the buttons was missing. His black suit was rumpled. His face was red, probably because in his mind he was already arguing. As the days wore on, Farmer's smiles and his vigour returned, and with them, somehow, the illusion of a stylishly dressed man. He seemed to be winning the argument about the percentage of the loan the prisoners would receive. Now he and the other consultants were arguing about details, about whether or not the gaunt, tuberculous prisoners would receive 10 cents' worth of extra food a day. 'The food fight', Farmer called it. He kept his temper and practised his usual brand of tourism. He visited a prison.</p> <p>Moscow's central prison, the largest in the city, is called a sizo - a detention centre. The building was immense, though I couldn't grasp its actual dimensions, because of the complexity of turnings, through doorways where you had to duck your head, and climbings, up ancient metal staircases, and hikes, down corridors that made me think of abandoned subway tunnels, with some sort of yellow fibreboard slapped haphazardly on the walls. 'Don't get lost,' a prison official said. 'This is not a good place to get lost.'</p> <p>We passed a file of prisoners, all dressed in ragged coats and caps, grey faces in dim light. Then we reached the prison hospital. 'Think of Cuba,' Farmer whispered to me. 'Look at this shitty place.' The guides were all doctors or public-health officials, and they deplored the conditions. They opened the door to a cell reserved for patients with Aids. 'There are fewer than in the usual cells,' one of the doctors said.</p> <p>'How many?'</p> <p>'Only 50 in this room.'</p> <p>Farmer went in first, followed by a translator. A dingy grey room, full of bunk beds, laundry hanging from clotheslines. Most of the men were young. In a moment, Farmer was shaking hands with them, touching arms and shoulders, and in another moment loud voices all around him were competing to air grievances.</p> <p>Another twisty passage, into the TB department. 'The doctors are over-worked and have almost no protection,' an official said. 'The X-ray equipment - it is exhausted.' They weren't sure how many patients had drug-resistant strains. 'We do not have laboratory support from Moscow.'</p> <p>We went into another cell, this one filled with TB patients, the same as the last but a little more crowded and humid - the humidity comes from many pairs of lungs exhaling. Several men were coughing, each distinctively, I thought - a Chaliapin bass, a baritone, a tenor. Farmer stood beside a bed, his arm resting on the mattress of an upper berth. 'You look good,' he said to one of the men. 'Anybody coughing up blood?'</p> <p>'No.'</p> <p>'So, people are getting better?'</p> <p>'It's not worse,' said a prisoner.</p> <p>He asked where they came from.</p> <p>Grozny, Volga, Baku,' Farmer said to the translator. 'And it's better to be here. Tell him I've been to Colony Three.'</p> <p>'Good luck,' Farmer said through the translator. 'I hope everybody gets better.' We headed back towards the prison office. 'I like these prison medical people,' Farmer said to me. 'They're trying.'</p> <p>About 10 per cent of Russia's 1m prisoners had active TB. In many prisons, a majority of them had drug-resistant strains; 20 per cent, it was feared, had MDR. On top of that, one of the doctors told Farmer, the incidence of syphilis was rising. Alarming, because rising syphilis announces the imminence of Aids, and Aids would grossly magnify the TB epidemic. 'It's gonna be a fucking disaster,' Farmer said softly to me as we headed back to the central office.</p> <p>In the end, Farmer won his skirmishes in Moscow. He'd managed to sneak food into the budget by calling it vitamins. And, for now at least, the prisoners would get about half the loan. The first instalment was projected at $30m. (The figure has since been increased to $170m, paid out over five years.) Farmer believed the world ought to spend the money outright, not lend it, and he figured that staunching the epidemic in Russia and the former republics would cost at least half a billion dollars. Still, he felt happy.</p> <p>So did Goldfarb. 'I am always ambivalent, though,' he told Farmer. 'It means I have to deal with this $30m. Keep them from stealing it. And there is a lot at stake. It has to work, or we can forget Dots-Plus.'</p> <p>Farmer and Goldfarb spent a lot of time together that week. Goldfarb usually appeared in slightly rumpled tweeds and corduroys, threatening to do battle with one or another Russian official or member of the World Bank team. Farmer would argue him out of this. They seemed to have the kind of friendship that thrives on argument. At dinner one night, Goldfarb said, in sonorously accented English, 'Prisoners. They are not nice people. They are epeedeemeeologically eempoortant.'</p> <p>'Our big split,' said Farmer. He turned to me. 'The stench of innocence is what I smell. The stench of guilt is what he smells.'</p> <p>'I should take that back,' Goldfarb said. 'About half of the people shouldn't be in jail.'</p> <p>'Three-quarters,' said Farmer. 'Come on Alex. Those are crimes against property.'</p> <p>'There is 25 per cent should be in jail for life,' said Goldfarb.</p> <p>'No, 10 per cent,' said Farmer. 'You think I'm naive.'</p> <p>'You are not naive,' said Goldfarb.</p> <p>'You see the whole situation. You just don't accept that\u0085'</p> <p>'People aren't nice.'</p> <p>'No! Bad people. You are not naive. You can just disregard things which are unpleasant, and that is why you are not scientific. You disregard reality.'</p> <p>Farmer had wished for a blizzard in Moscow. He had got just a snowfall. We walked back to the hotel in the cold, cold night, Farmer with his red scarf over his nose, his glasses fogging up.</p> <p>I rehearsed his argument with Goldfarb, Farmer's whittling down the number he thought should be in prison. If it had gone on, I thought, he might have got down zero.</p> <p>'Do you think I'm crazy?' Farmer asked.</p> <p>'No. But some of those prisoners have done terrible things.'</p> <p>'I know,' he said. 'And I believe in historical accuracy.'</p> <p>'But you forgive everyone.'</p> <p>'I guess I do. Do you think that's crazy?'</p> <p>'No,' I said. 'But it's a fight you can't win.'</p> <p>'That's all right. I'm prepared for defeat.'</p> <p>'But there are the small victories,' I said.</p> <p>'And I love them!' he replied.</p> <p>We left Moscow before dawn, and flew to Zurich, where we boarded a plane to Boston. Farmer carried a large curved sabre made of glass and filled with cognac, a present from the Deputy Justice Minister. The customs agents raised their eyebrows. Other passengers did double takes. He smiled back, but his smile looked wan. Every takeoff and landing nauseated Farmer for a few minutes. When we arrived in Boston the next afternoon, he'd have to go right to another meeting - funding for the women's clinic in Cange was running out.</p> <p>Most modern descriptions of human behaviour give selfishness great explanatory power, even over what looked like selfless acts. But after I'd spent a month with Farmer altruism had begun to seem plausible, even normal. On the airplane back to Boston, he offered his own explanation. 'There's a social truth and a personal truth,' Farmer said, once we'd crammed ourselves into our seats. 'We live in a time of great ease and bounty.</p> <p>I have complete access to all that ease and bounty. At the same time, I have had the world revealed to me as it really is. It isn't a different world - it's the same world.</p> <p>He glanced out the window, and began telling me a story. Back before Zanmi Lasante, he said - when he was 23, volunteering as a doctor's assistant in a hospital in Leogane, in Haiti - he had a long talk with an American doctor, a kindly man who seemed to love the Haitians. The doctor had worked there for a year. Now he was departing.</p> <p>'Isn't it going to be hard to leave?'</p> <p>'Are you kidding? I can't wait. There's no electricity. It's just brutal here.'</p> <p>'But aren't you worried about not being able to forget all this? There's so much disease here.'</p> <p>'No,' said the doctor. 'I'm an American, and I'm going home.' Farmer thought about that conversation all day and into the evening. He thought the doctor's answer was sensible, a legitimate answer. But he didn't know his own. He was supposed to start medical school himself in the autumn. I'm definitely going to be a doctor, he thought.</p> <p>Farmer fidgeted in the narrow airplane seat. 'So later on that night, a young woman came in. She was pregnant, and she had malaria\u0085 It's not as if it hasn't happened since.' He stopped, his face turned to the window again. 'She had a very high parasitimia. Bad malaria. She went into a coma and, you know, I didn't know the details then. I do now, because it's my speciality. She needed a transfusion, and her sister was there and\u0085' It was drizzling outside. He stared out at the runway landscape, grey and dull, crying softly.</p> <p>'It's not about her. It happens all the time in Haiti, but I didn't know that then. So there was no blood at the hospital, and the doctor told her sister to go to Port-au-Prince to get some blood. But she would need some money. I ran around the hospital. I rounded up $15. I gave her the money and she left, and then she came back, and she didn't have enough money to go to Port-au-Prince. So meanwhile the patient started having respiratory distress. And this pink stuff started coming out of her mouth, and the nurses were saying, 'We should do a Caesarean delivery.' I said, 'There's got to be some way to get her some blood.' Her sister was beside herself. She was sobbing and crying. The woman had five kids. The sister said 'This is terrible. You can't even get a blood transfusion if you're poor.' And she said, 'We're all human beings.'</p> <p>The flight crew was preparing the cabin for takeoff. In a moment, Farmer would start feeling sick. 'My big struggle is how people can not care, erase, not remember. I'm not a dour person. But I have a terrible message. And I'm not gonna put my seat in an upright position.'</p> <p>He had recovered his normal voice. The death was a memory again. He said, quoting the sister once more, '\"We're all human beings.\"' As if in answer to my question. He shook his head.</p> <p>'The other thing about it is, I knew the others focused on my reaction. The nurses were saying, 'Poor Paul. What a sweet young man.' And the doctors thought, He's new here, he's green, he's naive.' He paused. 'Yeah, but I got staying power. That's the thing. I wasn't naive, in fact.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "About a third of the world's people have TB bacilli in their bodies, but the bacterium is indolent. It multiplies into lung-consuming, bone-eating illness in only 10 per cent of the infected. People who live in crowded peasant huts and prisons and homeless shelters and slums stand the best chances of inhaling TB bacilli, of having the infection expand into active disease, and also, in some settings, of contracting or generating drug-resistant strains. A person with active disease who receives only one anti-TB drug, or who receives several for too short a time, can become a site of rapid bacterial evolution. The drugs apply the selective pressure. The host winds up sick with bacilli immune to those drugs, then coughs them up for others to share. This occurs infrequently in places of nearly universal poverty such as Haiti, where most people don't get treated at all, and most often in places where wealth and poverty are mingled, where the poor receive some therapy but not enough - places such as New York City, Peru and post-Soviet Russia. Farmer was obliged to go to Moscow because five years ago an old friend of his, a priest named Father Jack, had died of drug-resistant tuberculosis. It seemed that he must have caught it while working in Carabayllo, a slum on the outskirts of Lima. Farmer and a close friend and colleague named Jim Yong Kim - a fellow doctor from Harvard and the executive director of Partners in Health - went to the shantytown and, sure enough, discovered an epidemic of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) TB. The patients they found in Carabayllo - about 50, initially - were mainly young, and all were poor. Most had severely damaged lungs. Partners in Health had already helped finance a small clinic in the shantytown, and a good doctor was on hand, but cures would be difficult. Many of the workers were terrified of inhaling the drug-resistant germs. Farmer and Kim would have to arrange to feed the patients, in order to strengthen their immune systems. They'd have to arrange for laboratory analysis of each patient's TB, so that they'd know which antibiotics to use. Because most patients had TB resistant to all five of the best drugs, they'd have to give them 'second-line' antibiotics. In short, they'd have to build a first-rate health-care system out of the shantytown's mediocre one - a system that would administer those drugs reliably and keep the patients' spirits up, because the second-line drugs are weak and have unpleasant side effects, which a patient has to endure for as much as two years. Moreover, the second-line drugs were little used and very expensive, and Farmer and Kim didn't know where they'd find the money to buy them and they had no chance of getting money from foundations, because the World Health Organisation (WHO) had declared projects like theirs too expensive for 'resource-poor settings'. The WHO had created a program for worldwide TB control called Dots (Directly Observed Therapy Short Course). Properly applied, Dots ensures that patients take regular doses of the cheap and powerful first-line antibiotics for six to eight months. Dots worked well in most places. Farmer had used the programme for years in Haiti, even back before it had a name. It was inexpensive. It was all that poor countries could afford. Therefore, the policymakers reasoned, it had to be sufficient, even in settings where first-line-drug-resistance had surfaced. Farmer and Kim had some allies. The most powerful was Howard Hiatt, the former dean of the Harvard School of Public Health. He watched their project in Peru, a little nervously, from a distance. For a time, he wondered where they were getting the money for the second-line drugs. Then one day the president of the Brigham and Women's Hospital stopped him in a corridor and said, 'Your friends Farmer and Kim are in trouble with me. They owe this hospital $92,000.' Hiatt looked into the matter: 'Sure enough. They would stop at the pharmacy before they left for Peru and fill their briefcases with drugs.' Looking back, Hiatt was amused. 'That's their Robin Hood attitude.' Actually, they only borrowed the drugs. A Boston developer, Tom White, the chief donor to all their causes, soon wrote a check for the entire bill. It took Farmer about 22 hours to travel between Cange and Carabayllo and back again. Over the next three years, he made the journey 50 times. Kim went almost as often. 'Peru nearly killed us,' Farmer said later - and it was literally true in his case, when he came down with hepatitis A and ignored the symptoms for a time. But the results were very good. Indeed, 'astonishing' to Hiatt. 'Paul and Jim mobilised the world to accept drug-resistant TB as a soluble problem,' Hiatt says, looking back. 'At least 2m people a year die of TB, more adults than from any other infectious disease. And when those people who die include predominantly people with drug-resistant strains, as will happen unless a very big and good programme gets established, it's not going to be 2m.' Many other meetings and arguments followed, but after that one a general strategy for treating MDR officially existed, and was endorsed by the WHO - a strategy like the one Farmer and Kim had used. It even had a name: Dots-Plus. With help from Hiatt, and later from others as well, Kim worked to reduce the prices of the second-line drugs. But Peru had drained about a $1m a year from their treasury - all the money they'd hoped to save as an endowment for Partners in Health. Farmer asked for help from the Open Society Institute (OSI), George Soros's foundation. The OSI turned him down, but sent him a letter of recommendation. It said that the OSI understood the importance of his and Kim's work in Peru, because the OSI had a similar project in Russia. Farmer knew about the TB epidemic in Russia, of course. It had arisen in the turmoil that followed the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The troubles contained ingredients not just for an epidemic but for a drug-resistant epidemic: a failing health-care system, a rising crime rate. Farmer knew that Soros had put up $12.5m for a pilot project to improve TB control in Russia. But Farmer hadn't known the details until he saw the letter. The OSI would use the Dots strategy. It would treat all patients as if they had nonresistant, pan-susceptible TB, and for those who didn't get better it would provide hospice care to ease their deaths. Farmer was appalled. With Hiatt's blessing, he wrote a two-page letter to the OSI, explaining that its project was bound to fail. In the event, Farmer ended up in George Soros's office. Soros shouted over the phone at the director of his project, Alex Goldfarb, for a while, in Farmer's presence. Then he asked Farmer to help fix the pilot project. Farmer wavered. Haiti needed him more. But his basic impulse was to say, 'You can't just let a poor person die,' and here he thought he saw a chance to apply this creed on every level. So Farmer took a trip to Siberia with Goldfarb. They returned as friends. What they saw in the overcrowded prisons alarmed Farmer. He and Goldfarb went to see Soros to ask for more money. Soros said that would just delay the international response. Instead, he arranged a meeting at the White House, with Hillary Clinton presiding. Farmer and Goldfarb helped write the talking points for Soros and critiqued the ones prepared for the First Lady. She prevailed upon the World Bank to take action, and the World Bank dispatched something called a mission to Moscow, a group of economists, epidemiologists, and public-health experts who would work out the details of a TB loan to Russia. This mission to Moscow was a good example of what Farmer meant when he said that in Areas of Moral Clarity only the imperative to take action is clear. He represented the World Bank on the problem of TB in Russian prisons. Goldfarb represented the Russian Ministry of Justice, which ran the prisons. The Ministry of Health, in charge of the civilian sector, felt it should receive the great majority of whatever money was loaned. Some of the World Bank consultants agreed. But nearly half of all cases and most of the drug-resistant ones languished in the prisons. So he and Goldfarb thought the Ministry of Justice should get half the loan. The mixture seemed combustible: World Bank consultants mixed with Russian colonels and generals and former members of a defeated empire, on the look out for condescension. Farmer had flown to Russia four times already on this business, and he was tired of it, he said. Tired of the meetings and arguments in rooms that grew increasingly airless, where there were no patients, his thoughts straying back to Haiti: when the next meningitis victim came in, would the doctors, in his absence, do a spinal tap? Tired physically, too, just then. Our first morning in Moscow, he said at breakfast, 'I'm still biologically deranged.' He wore his third and last shirt. One of the buttons was missing. His black suit was rumpled. His face was red, probably because in his mind he was already arguing. As the days wore on, Farmer's smiles and his vigour returned, and with them, somehow, the illusion of a stylishly dressed man. He seemed to be winning the argument about the percentage of the loan the prisoners would receive. Now he and the other consultants were arguing about details, about whether or not the gaunt, tuberculous prisoners would receive 10 cents' worth of extra food a day. 'The food fight', Farmer called it. He kept his temper and practised his usual brand of tourism. He visited a prison. Moscow's central prison, the largest in the city, is called a sizo - a detention centre. The building was immense, though I couldn't grasp its actual dimensions, because of the complexity of turnings, through doorways where you had to duck your head, and climbings, up ancient metal staircases, and hikes, down corridors that made me think of abandoned subway tunnels, with some sort of yellow fibreboard slapped haphazardly on the walls. 'Don't get lost,' a prison official said. 'This is not a good place to get lost.' We passed a file of prisoners, all dressed in ragged coats and caps, grey faces in dim light. Then we reached the prison hospital. 'Think of Cuba,' Farmer whispered to me. 'Look at this shitty place.' The guides were all doctors or public-health officials, and they deplored the conditions. They opened the door to a cell reserved for patients with Aids. 'There are fewer than in the usual cells,' one of the doctors said. 'How many?' 'Only 50 in this room.' Farmer went in first, followed by a translator. A dingy grey room, full of bunk beds, laundry hanging from clotheslines. Most of the men were young. In a moment, Farmer was shaking hands with them, touching arms and shoulders, and in another moment loud voices all around him were competing to air grievances. Another twisty passage, into the TB department. 'The doctors are over-worked and have almost no protection,' an official said. 'The X-ray equipment - it is exhausted.' They weren't sure how many patients had drug-resistant strains. 'We do not have laboratory support from Moscow.' We went into another cell, this one filled with TB patients, the same as the last but a little more crowded and humid - the humidity comes from many pairs of lungs exhaling. Several men were coughing, each distinctively, I thought - a Chaliapin bass, a baritone, a tenor. Farmer stood beside a bed, his arm resting on the mattress of an upper berth. 'You look good,' he said to one of the men. 'Anybody coughing up blood?' 'No.' 'So, people are getting better?' 'It's not worse,' said a prisoner. He asked where they came from. Grozny, Volga, Baku,' Farmer said to the translator. 'And it's better to be here. Tell him I've been to Colony Three.' 'Good luck,' Farmer said through the translator. 'I hope everybody gets better.' We headed back towards the prison office. 'I like these prison medical people,' Farmer said to me. 'They're trying.' About 10 per cent of Russia's 1m prisoners had active TB. In many prisons, a majority of them had drug-resistant strains; 20 per cent, it was feared, had MDR. On top of that, one of the doctors told Farmer, the incidence of syphilis was rising. Alarming, because rising syphilis announces the imminence of Aids, and Aids would grossly magnify the TB epidemic. 'It's gonna be a fucking disaster,' Farmer said softly to me as we headed back to the central office. In the end, Farmer won his skirmishes in Moscow. He'd managed to sneak food into the budget by calling it vitamins. And, for now at least, the prisoners would get about half the loan. The first instalment was projected at $30m. (The figure has since been increased to $170m, paid out over five years.) Farmer believed the world ought to spend the money outright, not lend it, and he figured that staunching the epidemic in Russia and the former republics would cost at least half a billion dollars. Still, he felt happy. So did Goldfarb. 'I am always ambivalent, though,' he told Farmer. 'It means I have to deal with this $30m. Keep them from stealing it. And there is a lot at stake. It has to work, or we can forget Dots-Plus.' Farmer and Goldfarb spent a lot of time together that week. Goldfarb usually appeared in slightly rumpled tweeds and corduroys, threatening to do battle with one or another Russian official or member of the World Bank team. Farmer would argue him out of this. They seemed to have the kind of friendship that thrives on argument. At dinner one night, Goldfarb said, in sonorously accented English, 'Prisoners. They are not nice people. They are epeedeemeeologically eempoortant.' 'Our big split,' said Farmer. He turned to me. 'The stench of innocence is what I smell. The stench of guilt is what he smells.' 'I should take that back,' Goldfarb said. 'About half of the people shouldn't be in jail.' 'Three-quarters,' said Farmer. 'Come on Alex. Those are crimes against property.' 'There is 25 per cent should be in jail for life,' said Goldfarb. 'No, 10 per cent,' said Farmer. 'You think I'm naive.' 'You are not naive,' said Goldfarb. 'You see the whole situation. You just don't accept that\u0085' 'People aren't nice.' 'No! Bad people. You are not naive. You can just disregard things which are unpleasant, and that is why you are not scientific. You disregard reality.' Farmer had wished for a blizzard in Moscow. He had got just a snowfall. We walked back to the hotel in the cold, cold night, Farmer with his red scarf over his nose, his glasses fogging up. I rehearsed his argument with Goldfarb, Farmer's whittling down the number he thought should be in prison. If it had gone on, I thought, he might have got down zero. 'Do you think I'm crazy?' Farmer asked. 'No. But some of those prisoners have done terrible things.' 'I know,' he said. 'And I believe in historical accuracy.' 'But you forgive everyone.' 'I guess I do. Do you think that's crazy?' 'No,' I said. 'But it's a fight you can't win.' 'That's all right. I'm prepared for defeat.' 'But there are the small victories,' I said. 'And I love them!' he replied. We left Moscow before dawn, and flew to Zurich, where we boarded a plane to Boston. Farmer carried a large curved sabre made of glass and filled with cognac, a present from the Deputy Justice Minister. The customs agents raised their eyebrows. Other passengers did double takes. He smiled back, but his smile looked wan. Every takeoff and landing nauseated Farmer for a few minutes. When we arrived in Boston the next afternoon, he'd have to go right to another meeting - funding for the women's clinic in Cange was running out. Most modern descriptions of human behaviour give selfishness great explanatory power, even over what looked like selfless acts. But after I'd spent a month with Farmer altruism had begun to seem plausible, even normal. On the airplane back to Boston, he offered his own explanation. 'There's a social truth and a personal truth,' Farmer said, once we'd crammed ourselves into our seats. 'We live in a time of great ease and bounty. I have complete access to all that ease and bounty. At the same time, I have had the world revealed to me as it really is. It isn't a different world - it's the same world. He glanced out the window, and began telling me a story. Back before Zanmi Lasante, he said - when he was 23, volunteering as a doctor's assistant in a hospital in Leogane, in Haiti - he had a long talk with an American doctor, a kindly man who seemed to love the Haitians.

      "body": "<p>It's a long time since we have struggled to pronounce the name Muttiah Muralitharan. He is only 29 but he's been around a good while now, making his Test debut nine years ago, and it is his name that will be on the lips of the England tourists as they set off for Sri Lanka on Tuesday. </p> <p>It may be a journalistic device to proclaim that 'everything depends on so and so', but in this case the assumption that the outcome of the Test series in Sri Lanka hinges on how the England batsmen deal with Muralitharan seems justified. If they can blunt Murali - as they did Saqlain in Pakistan - then they should avoid defeat and they might win. If not then England, who have lost their last two encounters with Sri Lanka in 1998 and 1993, will struggle. </p> <p>The Sri Lankans depend on Murali's unique brand of off-breaks even more than the Kiwis in the Eighties leant upon the sublime skills of Richard Hadlee. There have been times when the left arm seamer, Chaminda Vaas, threatened to be a potent ally for Murali but a succession of injuries has neutered him so that his prime function, alongside the other left-armer, Nuwan Zoysa, seems to be to create some rough outside the right-handers' off stump for Murali to aim at. </p> <p>England are unlikely to underestimate the challenge in Sri Lanka. They will be playing in alien conditions - in extreme humidity - and the pitches for the first two Tests, in Galle and Kandy, usually encourage the spinners.</p> <p>However one factor is very much in England's favour. For the past five weeks their players have been able to put their feet up, while savouring the unusual experience of being accorded hero status after their stunning victory in Karachi. They should be refreshed and eager for the fray. Meanwhile the Sri Lankans have been trekking around the globe with minimal success. They have just endured a gruelling series in South Africa and they are now in New Zealand. On 31 January they play the first of five one-day internationals against the Kiwis in a series that does not end until 11 February. This gives them little time to recuperate before the first Test starts in Galle on 22 February. In Sri Lanka England's relative freshness could be decisive. </p> <p>The Sri Lankans, even though they have recalled old timers, Aravinda de Silva and Hashan Tillekeratne, to their squad are still adjusting to the post-Ranatunga era. Arjuna Ranatunga was a dictatorial leader, who strutted around the field with Napoleonic arrogance. He may have infuriated opponents but he engendered remarkable self-belief among his own players. His replacement, Sanath Jayasuriya is a man of impressive dignity, who inspires devotion rather than awe from his players. Whether he can juggle his bowlers - at the other end to Murali - as deftly as his predecessor remains to be seen. </p> <p>England set off with an unusually settled side. Initially there will be just two decisions for Duncan Fletcher and Nasser Hussain to make. Inevitably one of them centres on Hick. They know that Hick has the capacity to dominate spinners but, after his mediocre efforts in Pakistan, should they persist with him in the Test team rather than Michael Vaughan, who is fit again? </p> <p>The other conundrum is who should be Ashley Giles' spinning partner. With Ian Salisbury exiled, the choice rests between Robert Croft and Jason Brown, who has now returned from the A tour in the West Indies. Brown would be the brave choice; he's now reckoned to be the more penetrating bowler.

      "bodyText": "It's a long time since we have struggled to pronounce the name Muttiah Muralitharan. He is only 29 but he's been around a good while now, making his Test debut nine years ago, and it is his name that will be on the lips of the England tourists as they set off for Sri Lanka on Tuesday. It may be a journalistic device to proclaim that 'everything depends on so and so', but in this case the assumption that the outcome of the Test series in Sri Lanka hinges on how the England batsmen deal with Muralitharan seems justified. If they can blunt Murali - as they did Saqlain in Pakistan - then they should avoid defeat and they might win. If not then England, who have lost their last two encounters with Sri Lanka in 1998 and 1993, will struggle. The Sri Lankans depend on Murali's unique brand of off-breaks even more than the Kiwis in the Eighties leant upon the sublime skills of Richard Hadlee. There have been times when the left arm seamer, Chaminda Vaas, threatened to be a potent ally for Murali but a succession of injuries has neutered him so that his prime function, alongside the other left-armer, Nuwan Zoysa, seems to be to create some rough outside the right-handers' off stump for Murali to aim at. England are unlikely to underestimate the challenge in Sri Lanka. They will be playing in alien conditions - in extreme humidity - and the pitches for the first two Tests, in Galle and Kandy, usually encourage the spinners. However one factor is very much in England's favour. For the past five weeks their players have been able to put their feet up, while savouring the unusual experience of being accorded hero status after their stunning victory in Karachi. They should be refreshed and eager for the fray. Meanwhile the Sri Lankans have been trekking around the globe with minimal success. They have just endured a gruelling series in South Africa and they are now in New Zealand. On 31 January they play the first of five one-day internationals against the Kiwis in a series that does not end until 11 February. This gives them little time to recuperate before the first Test starts in Galle on 22 February. In Sri Lanka England's relative freshness could be decisive. The Sri Lankans, even though they have recalled old timers, Aravinda de Silva and Hashan Tillekeratne, to their squad are still adjusting to the post-Ranatunga era. Arjuna Ranatunga was a dictatorial leader, who strutted around the field with Napoleonic arrogance. He may have infuriated opponents but he engendered remarkable self-belief among his own players. His replacement, Sanath Jayasuriya is a man of impressive dignity, who inspires devotion rather than awe from his players. Whether he can juggle his bowlers - at the other end to Murali - as deftly as his predecessor remains to be seen. England set off with an unusually settled side. Initially there will be just two decisions for Duncan Fletcher and Nasser Hussain to make. Inevitably one of them centres on Hick. They know that Hick has the capacity to dominate spinners but, after his mediocre efforts in Pakistan, should they persist with him in the Test team rather than Michael Vaughan, who is fit again? The other conundrum is who should be Ashley Giles' spinning partner. With Ian Salisbury exiled, the choice rests between Robert Croft and Jason Brown, who has now returned from the A tour in the West Indies. Brown would be the brave choice; he's now reckoned to be the more penetrating bowler. But Croft has experience overseas; he can bat a bit and will surely be on his best behaviour after his autumnal outburst. My guess is that they will take what seems to be the safer option and give the Welshman first go. But even Croft at his most outspoken knows that he's no Murali.

      "body": "<p>There are two risks that every reader of this column runs. The certain risk is that you will grow old. The contingent risk is that you may suffer some catastrophic accident that renders you disabled or incapable. This may happen before you are old though it is much more likely when you are already old. A fifth of Britain's pensioners are incapable of looking after themselves; injury as much as infirmity is the cause. </p> <p>The philosophic and political question is how should society respond. The conservative view is that such risks should be each individual's responsibility, and that the only intervention by the state should be to underwrite the circumstances of the very poorest who simply do not have the wherewithal to look after themselves. The liberal view is that because old age is certain and the consequences of a catastrophic and unpredictable accident are just that - catastrophic and realistically uninsurable - then these are definitive areas where the responsibility should be collective. The division is decisive; it defines a crucial difference between Left and Right. </p> <p>In Britain the conservative view has held sway for 20 years. The large moral proposition about the superiority of individual responsibility has been supported by two important sub-propositions.</p> <p>The first is that the delivery of support for the elderly by the state is often inefficient, and is better performed by the private sector; even the state's 'promise' about providing a good pension is fragile and better respected by the private sector. The second is that the state cannot afford - given an increasingly ageing population - to undertake collective responsibility for personal care and guarantee the value of the basic state pension even if it wanted. </p> <p>We must abandon universal provision and substitute targeted, means-tested provision only for the very needy. Thus the state pension has been allowed to become worth progressively less, indexed only to the growth of prices generally rather than wages. A safety net, the Minimum Income Retirement Guarantee, is de facto replacing the universal provision element of the state pension, meaning that individuals, from young disabled to elderly, who need personal care have been means tested to ensure only the poor get their care paid for. </p> <p>But last Thursday came a crucial dent in the conservative consensus. Liberal Democrat members of the Scottish Executive, under pressure from their party in the Scottish Parliament, forced the Labour leader of the Executive and Scotland's First Minister, Henry McLeish, into an extraordinary U-turn. Scotland is now committed to the universal provision of free personal care for the elderly, and a study group is to report by August on how to proceed. Scotland is demonstrating that it belongs to the European liberal mainstream, and is declaring independence from conservative England. More ominously for New Labour, it is yet more evidence that the custodianship of Britain's progressive tradition is passing from them. </p> <p>For New Labour strongly and passionately disagrees with universal and collective provision for old age and its consequences. It is readier to build a stronger safety-net for low-income groups than the Tories would consider, but its position is conservative even if at the liberal end of that spectrum. It has refused to consider the central recommendation of the Royal Commission on Long Term Care for the elderly that it set up after the election: that personal care for the elderly should be provided by the state free of charge with only living or 'hotel' costs to be means-tested. </p> <p>Instead, in its new Health and Social Care Bill, New Labour wants to standardise nationally the current lottery of means-tested charging, currently varying between local authorities, and wind down a worthwhile universal basic state pension. In this area, Labour is becoming the party of One Nation conservatism.

And the costs in the future in relation to people's likely means will remain catastrophic.'

In this area the balance of the argument was to act collectively.

Just as everyone has the right to free universal personal care, so everyone has the right to a solid universal state pension whose level is automatically linked to the rise in general living standards.

The Government may boast about healthy public finances, but if the consequence is to displace risk on to those incapable of accepting it then the boast is hollow. Universal personal care and a universal state pension are hallmarks of a society that understands the limits of individual responsibility. Congratulations to Scotland's Liberal Democrats.

      "bodyText": "There are two risks that every reader of this column runs. The certain risk is that you will grow old. The contingent risk is that you may suffer some catastrophic accident that renders you disabled or incapable. This may happen before you are old though it is much more likely when you are already old. A fifth of Britain's pensioners are incapable of looking after themselves; injury as much as infirmity is the cause. The philosophic and political question is how should society respond. The conservative view is that such risks should be each individual's responsibility, and that the only intervention by the state should be to underwrite the circumstances of the very poorest who simply do not have the wherewithal to look after themselves. The liberal view is that because old age is certain and the consequences of a catastrophic and unpredictable accident are just that - catastrophic and realistically uninsurable - then these are definitive areas where the responsibility should be collective. The division is decisive; it defines a crucial difference between Left and Right. In Britain the conservative view has held sway for 20 years. The large moral proposition about the superiority of individual responsibility has been supported by two important sub-propositions. The first is that the delivery of support for the elderly by the state is often inefficient, and is better performed by the private sector; even the state's 'promise' about providing a good pension is fragile and better respected by the private sector. The second is that the state cannot afford - given an increasingly ageing population - to undertake collective responsibility for personal care and guarantee the value of the basic state pension even if it wanted. We must abandon universal provision and substitute targeted, means-tested provision only for the very needy. Thus the state pension has been allowed to become worth progressively less, indexed only to the growth of prices generally rather than wages. A safety net, the Minimum Income Retirement Guarantee, is de facto replacing the universal provision element of the state pension, meaning that individuals, from young disabled to elderly, who need personal care have been means tested to ensure only the poor get their care paid for. But last Thursday came a crucial dent in the conservative consensus. Liberal Democrat members of the Scottish Executive, under pressure from their party in the Scottish Parliament, forced the Labour leader of the Executive and Scotland's First Minister, Henry McLeish, into an extraordinary U-turn. Scotland is now committed to the universal provision of free personal care for the elderly, and a study group is to report by August on how to proceed. Scotland is demonstrating that it belongs to the European liberal mainstream, and is declaring independence from conservative England. More ominously for New Labour, it is yet more evidence that the custodianship of Britain's progressive tradition is passing from them. For New Labour strongly and passionately disagrees with universal and collective provision for old age and its consequences. It is readier to build a stronger safety-net for low-income groups than the Tories would consider, but its position is conservative even if at the liberal end of that spectrum. It has refused to consider the central recommendation of the Royal Commission on Long Term Care for the elderly that it set up after the election: that personal care for the elderly should be provided by the state free of charge with only living or 'hotel' costs to be means-tested. Instead, in its new Health and Social Care Bill, New Labour wants to standardise nationally the current lottery of means-tested charging, currently varying between local authorities, and wind down a worthwhile universal basic state pension.

      "body": "<p>Whenever I sit down to write about the Oscars, I hear two tutelary figures speaking over my shoulder. On the right, the distinguished American film writer John Simon is telling me that the great thing about the Academy Awards is that seeing the judgments of professionals on their peers' work makes one realise the crucial value of independent critics. Whispering into my left ear is the late Lindsay Anderson, asking, as he frequently did as a moral test: 'You don't take the Oscars seriously, do you?' </p> <p>The Oscars have been awarded since 1927 by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the nominations made by the 13 arts and crafts divisions and the full 5,000 members all voting to produce the final results. Since 1943 the Hollywood Foreign Press Association - a group of reporters, columnists and photographers covering Tinseltown for the worldwide media - has been handing out Golden Globes. Recently, they've been taken seriously because of the accuracy with which they have been anticipating the Oscars. </p> <p>The presentation ceremony, which takes place this year on 25 March, now rates peak-time TV attention and front- page coverage. Are these Foreign Press people so smart that they impress Academy voters? Do their hearts beat along with the great collective heart of Hollywood? Or are these outsiders trying to predict what the insiders will do? Who knows? I for one couldn't name a single member of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. </p> <p>Anyway, in the interval between the presentation of the Globes last Sunday and the announcement of the Oscar nominations on 13 February, I've been asked to make a personal choice of who or what I think should win the top six Academy Award categories. There's a problem here because I've yet to see several contenders, among them Almost Famous, Pollock, All the Pretty Horses, Chocolat and The Contender. Another problem is that at least five performers are competing in two movies and could cancel themselves out. Here, nevertheless, are my choices.</p> <p><strong>Best picture - Traffic</strong><br> The Academy voters like prestige, financial success and spiritual uplift, which explains why comedies, musicals (unless they're about juvenile delinquency or nuns) and genre movies are very rarely rewarded. </p> <p>Gladiator, which I greatly admire, does, however, have a good deal going for it. Ben Hur without the religion, it has restored the historical epic, won critical respect and made a fortune. It's a strong contender, but my own choice would be Steven Soderbergh's Traffic, a superbly crafted movie on an urgent topic. <br>Golden Globe: Gladiator</p> <p><strong>Best director - Steven Soderbergh for Traffic</strong><br> Very rarely does the award for 'Best director' not go to the person who made the best film (though the latter award is picked up by its producer). So rarely in fact that when in 1989 the Best Film Oscar went to Bruce Beresford's Driving Miss Daisy and Oliver Stone was named best director for Born on the Fourth of July this was considered an insult to Beresford. My own choice for best director would be the British filmmaker Christopher Nolan for his dazzling thriller Memento, but despite its success in Britain it hasn't yet opened in Los Angeles, where it's set, and thus is not eligible this year. So I am torn between Ang Lee for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, which I have certain doubts about as a deal of its magic derives from the skills of its martial arts stunt director, and Steven Soderbergh for Traffic. The trouble is that another Soderbergh film, Erin Brockovich, is likely also to be nominated. Still I'll opt for Soderbergh and Traffic. <br>Golden Globe: Ang Lee for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon <br>Soderbergh's previous Oscar form: nominated for Best Screenplay for sex, lies and videotape in 1989</p> <p><strong>Best actor - Michael Douglas for Wonder Boys</strong><br> Tom Hanks has everything going for him with Cast Away - previous success, public and professional popularity, and the fact that he endured pain and sacrifice in the interest of authenticity. Ever since Lon Chaney donned repulsive make-up and contorted his body for hours on end in the silent days, the Academy has loved actors who suffer for their art, putting on or losing weight, growing hair and/or beard, twisting their limbs, playing cripples and idiots (village or savant). Hence the Oscars for John Mills (Ryan's Daughter), Robert De Niro (Raging Bull), Daniel Day Lewis (My Left Foot), Dustin Hoffman (Rain Man) et al. Hanks has a great publicity machine behind his desert-island film, whereas back in 1954 Daniel O'Herlihy, star of Luis Bu\u00f1uel's Robinson Crusoe, used his life savings to get a Hollywood Boulevard cinema to show the film once a day for a week and admit Academy members free so it would qualify. The happy result was that O'Herlihy was nominated as best actor for this low-budget Mexican production, though it lost out to Marlon Brando (On the Waterfront). </p> <p>My choice, however, for best actor is Michael Douglas as the frazzled novelist and university lecturer in Curtis Hanson's Wonder Boys, a really daring performance of considerable depth and integrity. Here again, Douglas could well be nominated for Traffic, though I think his earlier performance is richer. <br>Golden Globe: Tom Hanks, Cast Away <br>Michael Douglas's previous Oscar form: Best Actor for Wall Street (1987); Best Picture as producer for One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975)</p> <p><strong>Best supporting actor - Benicio Del Toro For Traffic</strong><br> Supporting actors have been one of the great attractions of the cinema since the 1920s. Their recurrent appearances have helped create and populate a celluloid world as real as the one we actually inhabit. </p> <p>Think of those faces that recur in the films of John Ford, Frank Capra and Sam Peckinpah; the heavies and comic losers who pop up in Warner Brothers melodramas; the actors typed as judges, bankers, barmen, servants, desk clerks, cops, moms and dads. This tradition goes on, though nowadays the younger character actors tend to be minor stars. </p> <p>The four strongest contenders for my choice of Best Supporting Actor are particularly fine because they play off larger performances and have made two or three appearances over the past year. First is the Cuban-born Tomas Milian, who plays a hispanic businessman in The Yards and the Mexican general in Traffic. Then there's Benicio Del Toro, playing a professional criminal in The Way of the Gun and the honest Mexican cop in Traffic; Ben Stiller, as the Jewish suitor in Meet the Parents; and Robert Downey Jr, who appeared in three pictures, most memorably as Michael Douglas's spaced-out editor in Wonder Boys. All in all, I'd like to see the prize go to Benicio Del Toro. <br>Golden Globe: Benicio Del Toro, Traffic. Benicio Del Toro has twice won Best Supporting Male Actor at the Independent Spirit Awards for The Usual Suspects (1995) and Basquiat (1996)</p> <p><strong>Best actress - Julia Roberts for Erin Brockovich</strong><br> I've heard great things about Joan Allen in The Contender and she's done some fine work in the past decade. But I haven't seen her movie. For sheer sacrifice and disregard for ego, Ellen Burstyn, who won an Oscar in 1974 in Martin Scorsese's Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, makes a searingly painful impression as the addicted widow in Requiem For a Dream. But I think it too strong meat for the Academy. </p> <p>Tracey Ullman is delightful in Woody Allen's Small Time Crooks, at first sensible, then sadly social climbing. She's sure to be nominated. But Julia Roberts's performance as the single mother and self-taught crusading lawyer in Erin Brockovich is a towering achievement that never strikes a false note. In this film you see a character and an actress grow. It's Roberts's best, and most ambitious work so far and she'll be pushed to surpass it. <br>Golden Globe: Julia Roberts, Erin Brockovich <br>Previous Oscar form: Nominated for Best Actress for Pretty Woman (1990); nominated for Best Supporting Actress for Steel Magnolias (1989)</p> <p><strong>Best supporting actress - Zhang Ziyi for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</strong><br> Numerous movies in contention for this year's Oscars either sideline women or provide them with no substantial roles - The Perfect Storm, Terms of Engagement, Gladiator, U-571, O Brother Where Art Thou among them. Of course, there was Charlie's Angels. In the supporting actress category, I have happy memories of Joan Cusack as the mutual friend of the the hero and heroine in Stephen Frears's High Fidelity. Catherine Zeta-Jones had a nice role in that film, but the part that would make her an Oscar contender this year would be that of the housewife in Traffic who discovers her husband's wealth derives from drug-dealing. </p> <p>The supporting performance of the year for me was the Chinese actress Zhang Ziyi as the rebellious young aristocrat in Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Apart from being beautiful, expressive and graceful, she plays an active role in some of the best martial arts sequences I've ever seen. Could the Academy give an Oscar to an actress speaking a foreign language? They did once, back in 1961, when Sophia Loren was named best actress in Vittorio De Sica's Two Women, but she'd already established a reputation in Hollywood by then. It would be marvellous, however, to see Zhang Ziyi honoured by Hollywood. <br>Golden Globe: Kate Hudson for Almost Famous <br>Zhang Ziyi's previous Oscar form: None; recently won Best Supporting Actress from the Online Film Critics Society</p> <p><strong>Last year's oscar winners</strong> </p> <p>Best picture American Beauty <br>Best director Sam Mendes (American Beauty)<br>Best actor Kevin Spacey (American Beauty) <br>Best supporting actor Michael Caine (Cider House Rules) <br>Best actress Hilary Swank (Boys Don't Cry) <br>Best supporting actress Angelina Jolie (Girl Interrupted)</p>",

      "body": "<p>The mailbag from the House of Commons was bulging. It arrived every day at the Home Office, brimming with the latest missives from MPs, questions from constituents and official business.</p> <p>On 18 December, between the documents on the criminal justice system and policing matters, was a one page letter from the parliamentary questions office in the Commons. It contained a two paragraph inquiry about two brothers and their relationship with two powerful men in the Government.</p> <p>'To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what representations he has received in the applications of GP Hindiya and SP Hindiya for British citizenship from a) the Right Honourable member for Hartlepool and b) the Honourable member for Leicester East.' It was the start of a scandal.</p> <p>The questions were sent to the office of Barbara Roche, the immigration Minister. Her officials looked nonplussed at the names being asked about: GP Hindiya and SP Hindiya. Did that mean the Hinduja brothers, billionaires, friends to the Labour glitterati and well-known Government glad-handers? They assumed it did.</p> <p>The questions were from Norman Baker, the Liberal Democrat MP, who was determined to uncover the truth about Srichand and Gopichand Hinduja and their relationships with those at the highest levels of the British Establishment. He had misspelt the names in the question, but this small error would not be enough to prevent the story from unfolding. Baker had been involved in discussions with The Observer , which was undertaking an investigation of its own. The two chimed. The Home Office started making inquiries.</p> <p>Half a mile away in the Northern Ireland Office, Peter Mandelson, the Secretary of State, was dealing with the finer intricacies of the stalled peace process. Gerry Adams and David Trimble had reached stalemate and Mandelson was gloomy. Looking forward to his Christmas break, he was not aware that a single piece of A4 paper circulating in the Home Office 'for comment'could damage him. He did not know that a bomb was ticking beneath him - a bomb that would destroy his career, threaten the future of another Minister and put a question mark over the judgment of Tony Blair himself.</p> <p>Today we can reveal the remarkable story of how an Observer investigation and a series of parliamentary questions about three brothers few had heard of became a Government crisis - how a simple two paragraph inquiry opened a stinking can of deceit, lies and obsfuscation.</p> <p>Yet Government officials knew for weeks that questions were going to be asked about ministerial 'inquiries' over passports for rich men. They still claimed they were caught on the hop when the calls came. We can reveal how official incompetence meant that, although the Home Office had agreed on 'lines to take', no one had bothered to tell the press officers who were fielding the calls. And we can reveal how a date of 1998 became 1997 because of an unexplained 'cock-up'. In short, this is a story of how passports-for-favours, official mistakes and a cover-up proved to be the bitterest blow to the New Labour project.</p> <p>Fiona Millar was in her Downing Street office when her assistant put a phonecall through last November. A journalist from this newspaper wanted to know about a dress the Prime Minister's wife was wearing at a party.The party was organised by Srichand Hinduja.</p> <p>It was an innocent inquiry and Millar, Cherie Blair's press spokeswoman, did not have to think long about her answer. 'They got it wrong,' she said of press reports that the dress was a gift from the Indian billionaires. 'They offered her an outfit. But she didn't want it and it went to charity.'</p> <p>That was the start. What Millar said revealed a new strategy. The Government wanted to distance itself from the Hindujas, among the world's richest men, now caught up in an Indian arms corruption scandal. The problem was the Hindujas did not want to be distant from the Government.</p> <p>A behind-the-scenes briefing battle began. The Government let it be known that the Hindujas were hardly part of Blair's inner circle; yes, Ministers (lots of Ministers) might have met them, but that was it.</p> <p>Sources close to the Hindujas said something rather different. Not only were the Hindujas well connected, they could also count on friendly Ministers and backbenchers to put in a quiet word on their behalf. Peter Mandelson was mentioned. Keith Vaz, the slick Minister for Europe, was mentioned.</p> <p>Later that month The Observer ran a story linking the Hindujas' \u00a31 million donation to the Faith zone at the Dome to successful applications for citizenship by two of the Hinduja brothers. There was a picture of Cherie in the kameez. The calls started coming in. One non-political source suggested that Mandelson - a regular visitor to the Hinduja's offices - may have used his influence to get the billionaire a passport.</p> <p>Rebuttal politics is a classic of the civil service: identify a potential problem and then provide a series of well defined lines to rebut the allegations to the point of boredom. Never volunteer information and be as economical with the facts as possible when asked questions. Then hope the problem goes away.</p> <p>It is a well practised and well used system. The Hindujas would be a classic example of how it could go wrong.</p> <p>Just before the Home Office packed up for Christmas, officials met to discuss the issue of the written question. It was recognised that legitimate questions could be asked about ministerial involvement in the brothers' passport applications. A rebuttal operation was put in place.</p> <p>Mike O'Brien, the quietly spoken Home Office Minister who was responsible for immigration matters in 1998, was contacted after Christmas. The Northern Ireland office was also brought into the loop and Mandelson was given the opportunity to make amendments. Vaz was offered the same courtesy.</p> <p>Although they could not have known the significance of the Mandelson call at the time, officials checked the timing and the exact nature of the approach. The file on the Hindujas was pulled out and a note was discovered detailing the call itself. A separate note from O'Brien's private secretary dated 2 July confirmed that the information passed on to Mandelson about SP Hinduja's application was correct.</p> <p>As is normal procedure, Vaz and Mandelson were contacted to tell them that a parliamentary question referring to them was about to be answered. Their input was invited. Vaz's office has informed The Observer that they approved the draft quickly and that it was only stalling from Mandelson that held up the release of the answer. Such was Mandelson's concern over the contents of the 100-word answer it was redrafted by officials six times. Mandelson appeared to know that something significant could be about to happen.</p> <p>On 18 January, in the vote office of the House of Commons, the answer arrived, exactly a month after the original question. A day later Mandelson would be asked about it. He would lie. Four days after that he would resign and be cast into the political wilderness.</p> <p>As the piece of paper bearing the seven lines that would sink Mandelson fluttered into the wooden in-tray in the House of Commons 10 days ago, a distinctly A-list group of European politicians and financiers were descending on Versailles for a discreet meeting of minds.</p> <p>The guest list ranged from Chancellor Gordon Brown - who arrived late on Friday from Brussels - and Jean Claude Trichet, governor of the Bank of France, to John Major's former adviser Andrew Tyrie and the ebullient former Dome chief, P-Y Gerbeau.</p> <p>And, there, at the heart of such an influential group, was Peter Mandelson - the man supposedly so absorbed in the Northern Ireland peace process that he would soon be too busy to remember details of his involvement in the passport-for-favours row.</p> <p>His heart hardly seemed to be in Belfast either. Mandelson's speech that Friday was on foreign policy and the only other thing on his mind was the Dome.</p> <p>He was spotted in the hotel bar with Gerbeau, getting an animated briefing on the Frenchman's bid to buy the building - a joint scheme with Mandelson's good friend, the nightclub boss James Palumbo.</p> <p>By early Saturday afternoon Mandelson, now on his way home from Versailles and being asked to provide answers, had briefed his special adviser Patrick Diamond with the now infamously dishonest statement to this newspaper: that it was his private secretary, not he, who placed the crucial call to O'Brien.</p> <p>When O'Brien turned to his Warwickshire home late last Sunday night, he had no idea of the storm about to break around him. Even when he picked up his copy of The Observer , there was no way of knowing that the front-page story about Mandelson and Srichand Hinduja was about to put him at the centre of a political crisis. The headline said: Mandelson Helped Dome Backer's Bid For Passport.</p> <p>O'Brien was, however, was puzzled by the statement that the matter was dealt with by Mandelson's private secretary, when he clearly remembered the phone conversation with Mandelson himself took place in June 1998. After a brief conversation with his private secretary, he went to bed assuming that a clarification would be made in the morning either by Mandelson himself or the Prime Minister's official spokesman, Alastair Campbell.</p> <p>O'Brien was not even mentioned in the story and the duty press officer at the Home Office did not think it worth ringing him to tell him about the calls already coming in about the story.</p> <p>On Monday morning, O'Brien began to feel uneasy. He still felt that the statement to The Observer could be interpreted as meaning that a telephone conversation had been set up by private secretaries - but that would be fine as long as Mandelson issued a clarification.</p> <p>But the clarification did not come. Campbell briefed the press lobby on Monday that there was no direct contact between Mandelson and O'Brien. Alarm bells began to ring. Chris Smith, the Culture Secretary, also needed to know what was going on. With questions to his department in the Commons that day, he was concerned that he would be asked about Mandelson.</p> <p>His private secretary duly placed a call to Mandelson's private office on Monday lunchtime, a couple of hours before he was due in the Commons, to check the line.</p> <p>The answer he received underlined Mandelson's desperation to maintain the lie, and his belief that he could still pull it off: Smith was told categorically to say that Mandelson had not personally intervened. Smith repeated the line in parliament, oblivious to the fact that he was being misleading.</p> <p>A senior press officer from the Home Office rang Downing Street. As O'Brien jumped into his ministerial car to travel back to his office after a function at the Fire Service College, his mobile phone rang. This needed to be sorted out, Downing Street told him. And quickly.</p> <p>Campbell spoke to Mandelson, asking: 'What's this about a phone call?' The Northern Ireland Secretary admitted that the call had been a direct one but that he had 'failed to recollect it'. Campbell knew he would have a tough time at the next day's lobby briefing of parliamentary journalists.</p> <p>Campbell decided to be straight. The original story was wrong, he admitted. Mandelson did not initially remember the call but now that 'offices were back up and running' the full facts were clear: there had been direct contact.</p> <p>The story led the lunchtime news. At 4pm Godric Smith, Campbell's deputy, walked over to the Commons for the afternoon lobby. There was mayhem. Mandelson was accused of lying. Smith had to hold the line: Mandelson, he said, had not remembered the call.</p> <p>After 40 minutes Smith stalked back to Downing Street. He spoke to Mandelson, at No 10 for talks on Ireland, and Campbell. 'It's meltdown,' Smith said.</p> <p>Could they hold their position? A plan was worked out: Mandelson would do a round of interviews explaining the situation. But then came the Secretary of State's second moment of madness. Asked by Guy Gibbon of Channel 4 News that night why he had forgotten the original conversation, Mandelson said he had done no such thing and directly blamed Downing Street for any other indication. Why don't you ask them about it? Mandelson said. The No 10 switch board buzzed with calls.</p> <p>On the wall in Keith Vaz's office is a line of photographs of former Ministers of Europe, stretching back from the gregarious Spanish-speaking Tristan Garel-Jones through to the fanatically Eurosceptic David Heathcoat-Amory and ending with a single, empty hook.</p> <p>The hook is waiting for a photograph of Nigel Keith Anthony Standish Vaz, holder of the job since 1999. By Foreign Office convention, Ministers' pictures are hung only when their subjects leave, whether in glory or in disgrace. The question now is how long Vaz can keep his picture - and himself - off that hook.</p> <p>When Mandelson resigned, Vaz was in the middle of doing what he does best, charming his hosts over a lavish lunch on an official visit to Prague. He was halfway through the main course when the pager message arrived telling him Mandelson was at that moment facing the cameras in Downing Street and telling the world that he was out.</p> <p>Until then, like most of Westminster, Vaz had been unable to believe that the Northern Ireland Secretary would really fall. But once he had, the trap was sprung for a new quarry: suddenly Vaz, the second man in the written answer, was a target too. It was inevitable that when questions were raised about the Hindujas' passport application the Foreign Office Minister would be caught up in the web of intrigue. Many Asian journalists view Vaz as the Hindujas 'bagman in parliament' and he has admitted making representations to the Home Office about their various citizenship applications. When pictures of the myriad of parties the Hindujas host are published, Vaz is nearly always there, somewhere in the background, smiling and spreading cheer. Some have claimed that Vaz was the man who introduced Mandelson to the Hindujas.</p> <p>Blair has said he is confident Vaz has not acted improperly since he became a Minister. Reports say he has 'topped and tailed' letters for the Hindujas, signing them and sending them to Mandelson and the Prime Minister, but this is supposed to have happened while he was a backbench MP in October 1997. The key question is whether Vaz, who refuses to discuss the letters, has helped the Hindujas since he became a Minister. Sir Anthony Hammond, who will investigate the passports-for-favours scandal, will grill him on the issue.</p> <p>As Vaz's plane home from Prague touched down on the day that Mandelson resigned, the Foreign Office was still absorbed with other gossip - Foreign Secretary Robin Cook had been dragged from a dinner with the Spanish Prime Minister by a hasty pager message from Downing Street, telling him that Peter Hain was being abruptly transferred from the FO to the Department of Trade and Industry in the emergency reshuffle.</p> <p>But by Thursday morning, when a worthy but dull foreign language initiative due to be launched by Vaz attracted a suspiciously large number of journalists, it was his turn in the spotlight. The Greek tragedy of Mandelson's fall now gave way to Whitehall farce.</p> <p>Vaz made his five-minute speech as billed, but before his fellow speakers had finished at the lectern, he shuffled ignominiously to the side of the stage, almost tripping over a music stand in his haste to escape, and fled through a back exit pursued by shouting journalists.</p> <p>As the double doors clanged shut behind him, Vaz had unwittingly sent a signal that he had something to hide. Although when doorstepped by reporters the next morning he insisted he would be vindicated, it did not look good.</p> <p>Vaz's influence in the Asian community is legendary. Before Christmas, the Foreign Office Minister Peter Hain held an exclusive party for diplomats and non-government organisations in the Locarno suite of the department's central London headquarters. The Hindujas were not on the invitation list, but Gopichand Hinduja and his son Sanjay were there, enjoying the food. Many say Vaz, the arch party man, smuggled them in.</p> <p>At least one leading member of the Asian political elite recalls warning the young Vaz to stay away from the Hindujas almost eight years ago, telling him they could only damage the bright and ambitious young MP, but he would not listen. 'This is where Peter Mandelson and he have one thing in common,' said the source. 'They always follow the rich.'</p> <p>On Wednesday morning, Mandelson left his home in west London at 10am clutching two red boxes. Ten minutes earlier the Downing Street switchboard had called saying that the Prime Minister wanted to see him. The Northern Ireland minister cancelled all his other engagements. He had already spoken to two friends, the author Robert Harris at 7.10am and his former adviser Ben Wegg-Prosser, 20 minutes earlier.</p> <p>He told both that, although the press looked bad, he thought he could still survive. He would explain to the Prime Minister that when he was asked about 'forgetting' the conversation with O'Brien he would say that he thought the allegation was that he had 'deliberately' forgotten. That was something entirely different, he would insist. On such fine lines are political reputations rescued. Or so he thought.</p> <p>But by the morning the Prime Minister had made up his mind. His old friend would have to have an astonishing explanation for three days of inconsistencies and U-turns to survive.</p> <p>When Mandelson arrived in Blair's private study at 10.45am, Campbell was already there. He was exasperated that there had been such confusion and that a 'good news' announcement on thousands of jobs at the Nissan car plant in Sunderland, due that week, was about to be overwhelmed.</p> <p>Mandelson started on his 'deliberately' forgot line while Blair looked on, sometimes gently shaking his head. 'Remember, Tony is a barrister and he wanted a cold long look at the facts,' said one Downing Street aide. 'When he had heard all the facts he came to a decision and that was that Peter had to go.'</p> <p>Campbell left after 10 minutes for the morning lobby briefing, aware that if he were too late the journalists would start putting two and two together. He said that the meeting upstairs was difficult and that he wasn't quite sure of the position. Thirty minutes later Blair told Mandelson that there was no way out.</p> <p>Mandelson emerged and made his resignation statement on the steps of Number 10. But he was not contrite, blaming the press for his downfall. Even then, Mandelson thought he would find a way back into politics.</p> <p>Speaking to a close friend on Friday evening, his sentiment was clear. 'This inquiry might be a lot more interesting than some people are saying. I would watch it with a great deal of interest.' He would not go gently into the good night.</p> <p>Mandelson could not help himself, letting it be known through friends that he would continue as MP for Hartlepool. His many enemies did not want that. They wanted him gone. For Good.</p> <p>Downing Street machinery has now made it clear that Mandelson had more than simply 'a moment of madness' when he lied to The Observer</p> <p>In a scathing attack on a Minister once described as Tony Blair's closest ally, senior sources have said there was growing concern 'over a number of weeks' about his 'lack of focus' and his 'non-attention' to detail. A Downing Street source described him as 'slightly detached'. The last time this phrase was used to journalists, Campbell was talking about Ron Davies, the Minister who was caught during a 'moment of madness' on Clapham Common in London.</p> <p>At No 10 there is exasperation that 'Peter is still up to his old tricks', as one official put it. Although Mandelson said he was tired of politics and no longer had the stomach for the fight, Blair allies blame him for a series of stories that have appeared detailing his feelings on the feuding with Gordon Brown.</p> <p>Privately, ministers say Mandelson's influence has been quietly waning for some time. The first outward sign came when Downing Street let it be known last autumn that he had been told off by Campbell for leaking a speech to a secret dinner of pro-euro businessmen, causing a political row that upstaged several Government announcements. It was the first time a dressing-down had been publicly administered.</p> <p>Then came complaints late last year from inside Millbank that Mandelson, busy in Northern Ireland, was too distant from the election campaign, leaving Brown an unexpectedly free rein.</p> <p>Downing Street, far from, as some suggest, kicking the Hammond report into the long grass until after the next General Election, want it to be published quickly. Downing Street aides say that Tony Blair is well aware of the mess John Major got into over cash for questions. The former PM tried to lance the sleazy boil by calling a rapid end to his Government before the parliamentary report on Neil Hamilton, brown envelopes and Mohammed Al Fayed could be published. So it ran like a festering sore throughout the campaign and simply served to remind the electorate about matters of Conservative wrong-doing.</p> <p>Then there is the role of Gordon Brown. His hand has been strengthened by Mandelson's demise. The emphasis will change. Brown will concentrate on core Labour values and prefers to have a few beers while watching football than going to opulent political parties as Mandelson did.</p> <p>Not before time, many back benchers argue. Labour's big problem at the next election will be getting out its core vote - the heartlands issue - and not the Mondeo Man swing voter. Brown's allies say that Mandelson went just as his version of the New Labour future was becoming less central to Blair's future. Mandelson's allies grumble that this is the 'death of the project'.</p> <p>But they should not over-egg that pudding. Brown is the arch pragmatist, the man who knows how to win elections. 'Gordon didn't get where he is today by simply saying he knows how to solve child poverty,' said one well placed Labour official. There will still be plenty of tummy tickling for Mondeo Man. Far from delight at Mandelson's fall, Brown grumbled that the man he barely speaks to had got Labour into 'another hole'. And the events of last week do not necessarily mean that Euro project so beloved by the member for Hartlepool is derailed either.</p> <p>Although Roger Liddle, the European enthusiast in Downing Street, has lost his biggest backer, Brown is a political animal like no other. He is sceptical about the value of the euro at present because it is useful, given the public's opinion, to be sceptical. 'Gordon will move rapidly if he sees that it is in our interest and that public opinion is moving,' said one key pro-European campaigner. Robin Cook, the Foreign Secretary who has surprised Blair, not a natural ally, during his performances in Nice, will still plug away at the pro-euro line. Mandelson will still float gently in the background, cajoling his friend the Prime Minister to seize his moment in history and join up. The referendum will be delayed, not forgotten.</p> <p>The excitable shouts of 'Resign!' from the Tory backbenches as Tony Blair faced the Commons on Wednesday might have been overly optimistic, but there is no doubt the week has boosted morale in Smith Square.</p> <p>William Hague's promise of an 'unrelenting' pursuit of more ministerial scalps and of Tony Blair's 'appalling error of judgment' in trusting Mandelson, in a speech to a reporters' luncheon on Thursday which was hurriedly rejigged to take account of events, illustrated his strategy for the next week.</p> <p>Although it had been pencilled in as the launch of big tax and spending initiatives, with two major Hague speeches on Tuesday and Wednesday, his most urgent mission now will be to try and convince voters it is not just Mandelson but New Labour as a whole that is dishonest. If he can make the charge stick, Central Office believes it could cost Labour seats. But Hague is walking a narrow tightrope nonetheless: not only have the Hindujas been Tory donors in the past, but some senior Tories are privately muttering that his vitriolic speech on Wednesday was over the top since Mandelson had already resigned and could have backfired.</p> <p>It certainly won Blair one ally in Charles Kennedy. The Liberal Democrat leader meant to kick off his Commons speech by demanding a strengthening of the ministerial code: instead he was so irritated by what he saw as Hague's lack of generosity that he opened with an unscripted and impromptu attack on the Conservatives.</p> <p>Blair has been left to wonder what exactly seized the Northern Ireland Secretary when he decided to hide the truth on Saturday afternoon about a matter that he had been aware of for many days. Campbell has said that Mandelson can't even explain it to himself.</p> <p>It was ticking time bomb that might never have gone off. But Mandelson was never predictable.

      "bodyText": "The mailbag from the House of Commons was bulging. It arrived every day at the Home Office, brimming with the latest missives from MPs, questions from constituents and official business. On 18 December, between the documents on the criminal justice system and policing matters, was a one page letter from the parliamentary questions office in the Commons. It contained a two paragraph inquiry about two brothers and their relationship with two powerful men in the Government. 'To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what representations he has received in the applications of GP Hindiya and SP Hindiya for British citizenship from a) the Right Honourable member for Hartlepool and b) the Honourable member for Leicester East.' It was the start of a scandal. The questions were sent to the office of Barbara Roche, the immigration Minister. Her officials looked nonplussed at the names being asked about: GP Hindiya and SP Hindiya. Did that mean the Hinduja brothers, billionaires, friends to the Labour glitterati and well-known Government glad-handers? They assumed it did. The questions were from Norman Baker, the Liberal Democrat MP, who was determined to uncover the truth about Srichand and Gopichand Hinduja and their relationships with those at the highest levels of the British Establishment. He had misspelt the names in the question, but this small error would not be enough to prevent the story from unfolding. Baker had been involved in discussions with The Observer , which was undertaking an investigation of its own. The two chimed. The Home Office started making inquiries. Half a mile away in the Northern Ireland Office, Peter Mandelson, the Secretary of State, was dealing with the finer intricacies of the stalled peace process. Gerry Adams and David Trimble had reached stalemate and Mandelson was gloomy. Looking forward to his Christmas break, he was not aware that a single piece of A4 paper circulating in the Home Office 'for comment'could damage him. He did not know that a bomb was ticking beneath him - a bomb that would destroy his career, threaten the future of another Minister and put a question mark over the judgment of Tony Blair himself. Today we can reveal the remarkable story of how an Observer investigation and a series of parliamentary questions about three brothers few had heard of became a Government crisis - how a simple two paragraph inquiry opened a stinking can of deceit, lies and obsfuscation. Yet Government officials knew for weeks that questions were going to be asked about ministerial 'inquiries' over passports for rich men. They still claimed they were caught on the hop when the calls came. We can reveal how official incompetence meant that, although the Home Office had agreed on 'lines to take', no one had bothered to tell the press officers who were fielding the calls. And we can reveal how a date of 1998 became 1997 because of an unexplained 'cock-up'. In short, this is a story of how passports-for-favours, official mistakes and a cover-up proved to be the bitterest blow to the New Labour project. Fiona Millar was in her Downing Street office when her assistant put a phonecall through last November. A journalist from this newspaper wanted to know about a dress the Prime Minister's wife was wearing at a party.The party was organised by Srichand Hinduja. It was an innocent inquiry and Millar, Cherie Blair's press spokeswoman, did not have to think long about her answer. 'They got it wrong,' she said of press reports that the dress was a gift from the Indian billionaires. 'They offered her an outfit. But she didn't want it and it went to charity.' That was the start. What Millar said revealed a new strategy. The Government wanted to distance itself from the Hindujas, among the world's richest men, now caught up in an Indian arms corruption scandal. The problem was the Hindujas did not want to be distant from the Government. A behind-the-scenes briefing battle began. The Government let it be known that the Hindujas were hardly part of Blair's inner circle; yes, Ministers (lots of Ministers) might have met them, but that was it. Sources close to the Hindujas said something rather different. Not only were the Hindujas well connected, they could also count on friendly Ministers and backbenchers to put in a quiet word on their behalf. Peter Mandelson was mentioned. Keith Vaz, the slick Minister for Europe, was mentioned. Later that month The Observer ran a story linking the Hindujas' \u00a31 million donation to the Faith zone at the Dome to successful applications for citizenship by two of the Hinduja brothers. There was a picture of Cherie in the kameez. The calls started coming in. One non-political source suggested that Mandelson - a regular visitor to the Hinduja's offices - may have used his influence to get the billionaire a passport. Rebuttal politics is a classic of the civil service: identify a potential problem and then provide a series of well defined lines to rebut the allegations to the point of boredom. Never volunteer information and be as economical with the facts as possible when asked questions. Then hope the problem goes away. It is a well practised and well used system. The Hindujas would be a classic example of how it could go wrong. Just before the Home Office packed up for Christmas, officials met to discuss the issue of the written question. It was recognised that legitimate questions could be asked about ministerial involvement in the brothers' passport applications. A rebuttal operation was put in place. Mike O'Brien, the quietly spoken Home Office Minister who was responsible for immigration matters in 1998, was contacted after Christmas. The Northern Ireland office was also brought into the loop and Mandelson was given the opportunity to make amendments. Vaz was offered the same courtesy. Although they could not have known the significance of the Mandelson call at the time, officials checked the timing and the exact nature of the approach. The file on the Hindujas was pulled out and a note was discovered detailing the call itself. A separate note from O'Brien's private secretary dated 2 July confirmed that the information passed on to Mandelson about SP Hinduja's application was correct. As is normal procedure, Vaz and Mandelson were contacted to tell them that a parliamentary question referring to them was about to be answered. Their input was invited. Vaz's office has informed The Observer that they approved the draft quickly and that it was only stalling from Mandelson that held up the release of the answer. Such was Mandelson's concern over the contents of the 100-word answer it was redrafted by officials six times. Mandelson appeared to know that something significant could be about to happen. On 18 January, in the vote office of the House of Commons, the answer arrived, exactly a month after the original question. A day later Mandelson would be asked about it. He would lie. Four days after that he would resign and be cast into the political wilderness. As the piece of paper bearing the seven lines that would sink Mandelson fluttered into the wooden in-tray in the House of Commons 10 days ago, a distinctly A-list group of European politicians and financiers were descending on Versailles for a discreet meeting of minds. The guest list ranged from Chancellor Gordon Brown - who arrived late on Friday from Brussels - and Jean Claude Trichet, governor of the Bank of France, to John Major's former adviser Andrew Tyrie and the ebullient former Dome chief, P-Y Gerbeau. And, there, at the heart of such an influential group, was Peter Mandelson - the man supposedly so absorbed in the Northern Ireland peace process that he would soon be too busy to remember details of his involvement in the passport-for-favours row. His heart hardly seemed to be in Belfast either. Mandelson's speech that Friday was on foreign policy and the only other thing on his mind was the Dome. He was spotted in the hotel bar with Gerbeau, getting an animated briefing on the Frenchman's bid to buy the building - a joint scheme with Mandelson's good friend, the nightclub boss James Palumbo. By early Saturday afternoon Mandelson, now on his way home from Versailles and being asked to provide answers, had briefed his special adviser Patrick Diamond with the now infamously dishonest statement to this newspaper: that it was his private secretary, not he, who placed the crucial call to O'Brien. When O'Brien turned to his Warwickshire home late last Sunday night, he had no idea of the storm about to break around him. Even when he picked up his copy of The Observer , there was no way of knowing that the front-page story about Mandelson and Srichand Hinduja was about to put him at the centre of a political crisis. The headline said: Mandelson Helped Dome Backer's Bid For Passport. O'Brien was, however, was puzzled by the statement that the matter was dealt with by Mandelson's private secretary, when he clearly remembered the phone conversation with Mandelson himself took place in June 1998. After a brief conversation with his private secretary, he went to bed assuming that a clarification would be made in the morning either by Mandelson himself or the Prime Minister's official spokesman, Alastair Campbell. O'Brien was not even mentioned in the story and the duty press officer at the Home Office did not think it worth ringing him to tell him about the calls already coming in about the story. On Monday morning, O'Brien began to feel uneasy. He still felt that the statement to The Observer could be interpreted as meaning that a telephone conversation had been set up by private secretaries - but that would be fine as long as Mandelson issued a clarification. But the clarification did not come. Campbell briefed the press lobby on Monday that there was no direct contact between Mandelson and O'Brien. Alarm bells began to ring. Chris Smith, the Culture Secretary, also needed to know what was going on. With questions to his department in the Commons that day, he was concerned that he would be asked about Mandelson. His private secretary duly placed a call to Mandelson's private office on Monday lunchtime, a couple of hours before he was due in the Commons, to check the line. The answer he received underlined Mandelson's desperation to maintain the lie, and his belief that he could still pull it off: Smith was told categorically to say that Mandelson had not personally intervened. Smith repeated the line in parliament, oblivious to the fact that he was being misleading. A senior press officer from the Home Office rang Downing Street. As O'Brien jumped into his ministerial car to travel back to his office after a function at the Fire Service College, his mobile phone rang. This needed to be sorted out, Downing Street told him. And quickly. Campbell spoke to Mandelson, asking: 'What's this about a phone call?' The Northern Ireland Secretary admitted that the call had been a direct one but that he had 'failed to recollect it'. Campbell knew he would have a tough time at the next day's lobby briefing of parliamentary journalists. Campbell decided to be straight. The original story was wrong, he admitted. Mandelson did not initially remember the call but now that 'offices were back up and running' the full facts were clear: there had been direct contact. The story led the lunchtime news. At 4pm Godric Smith, Campbell's deputy, walked over to the Commons for the afternoon lobby. There was mayhem. Mandelson was accused of lying. Smith had to hold the line: Mandelson, he said, had not remembered the call. After 40 minutes Smith stalked back to Downing Street. He spoke to Mandelson, at No 10 for talks on Ireland, and Campbell. 'It's meltdown,' Smith said. Could they hold their position? A plan was worked out: Mandelson would do a round of interviews explaining the situation. But then came the Secretary of State's second moment of madness. Asked by Guy Gibbon of Channel 4 News that night why he had forgotten the original conversation, Mandelson said he had done no such thing and directly blamed Downing Street for any other indication. Why don't you ask them about it? Mandelson said. The No 10 switch board buzzed with calls. On the wall in Keith Vaz's office is a line of photographs of former Ministers of Europe, stretching back from the gregarious Spanish-speaking Tristan Garel-Jones through to the fanatically Eurosceptic David Heathcoat-Amory and ending with a single, empty hook. The hook is waiting for a photograph of Nigel Keith Anthony Standish Vaz, holder of the job since 1999. By Foreign Office convention, Ministers' pictures are hung only when their subjects leave, whether in glory or in disgrace. The question now is how long Vaz can keep his picture - and himself - off that hook. When Mandelson resigned, Vaz was in the middle of doing what he does best, charming his hosts over a lavish lunch on an official visit to Prague. He was halfway through the main course when the pager message arrived telling him Mandelson was at that moment facing the cameras in Downing Street and telling the world that he was out. Until then, like most of Westminster, Vaz had been unable to believe that the Northern Ireland Secretary would really fall. But once he had, the trap was sprung for a new quarry: suddenly Vaz, the second man in the written answer, was a target too. It was inevitable that when questions were raised about the Hindujas' passport application the Foreign Office Minister would be caught up in the web of intrigue. Many Asian journalists view Vaz as the Hindujas 'bagman in parliament' and he has admitted making representations to the Home Office about their various citizenship applications. When pictures of the myriad of parties the Hindujas host are published, Vaz is nearly always there, somewhere in the background, smiling and spreading cheer. Some have claimed that Vaz was the man who introduced Mandelson to the Hindujas. Blair has said he is confident Vaz has not acted improperly since he became a Minister. Reports say he has 'topped and tailed' letters for the Hindujas, signing them and sending them to Mandelson and the Prime Minister, but this is supposed to have happened while he was a backbench MP in October 1997. The key question is whether Vaz, who refuses to discuss the letters, has helped the Hindujas since he became a Minister. Sir Anthony Hammond, who will investigate the passports-for-favours scandal, will grill him on the issue. As Vaz's plane home from Prague touched down on the day that Mandelson resigned, the Foreign Office was still absorbed with other gossip - Foreign Secretary Robin Cook had been dragged from a dinner with the Spanish Prime Minister by a hasty pager message from Downing Street, telling him that Peter Hain was being abruptly transferred from the FO to the Department of Trade and Industry in the emergency reshuffle. But by Thursday morning, when a worthy but dull foreign language initiative due to be launched by Vaz attracted a suspiciously large number of journalists, it was his turn in the spotlight. The Greek tragedy of Mandelson's fall now gave way to Whitehall farce. Vaz made his five-minute speech as billed, but before his fellow speakers had finished at the lectern, he shuffled ignominiously to the side of the stage, almost tripping over a music stand in his haste to escape, and fled through a back exit pursued by shouting journalists. As the double doors clanged shut behind him, Vaz had unwittingly sent a signal that he had something to hide. Although when doorstepped by reporters the next morning he insisted he would be vindicated, it did not look good. Vaz's influence in the Asian community is legendary. Before Christmas, the Foreign Office Minister Peter Hain held an exclusive party for diplomats and non-government organisations in the Locarno suite of the department's central London headquarters. The Hindujas were not on the invitation list, but Gopichand Hinduja and his son Sanjay were there, enjoying the food. Many say Vaz, the arch party man, smuggled them in. At least one leading member of the Asian political elite recalls warning the young Vaz to stay away from the Hindujas almost eight years ago, telling him they could only damage the bright and ambitious young MP, but he would not listen. 'This is where Peter Mandelson and he have one thing in common,' said the source. 'They always follow the rich.' On Wednesday morning, Mandelson left his home in west London at 10am clutching two red boxes. Ten minutes earlier the Downing Street switchboard had called saying that the Prime Minister wanted to see him. The Northern Ireland minister cancelled all his other engagements. He had already spoken to two friends, the author Robert Harris at 7.10am and his former adviser Ben Wegg-Prosser, 20 minutes earlier. He told both that, although the press looked bad, he thought he could still survive. He would explain to the Prime Minister that when he was asked about 'forgetting' the conversation with O'Brien he would say that he thought the allegation was that he had 'deliberately' forgotten. That was something entirely different, he would insist. On such fine lines are political reputations rescued. Or so he thought. But by the morning the Prime Minister had made up his mind. His old friend would have to have an astonishing explanation for three days of inconsistencies and U-turns to survive. When Mandelson arrived in Blair's private study at 10.45am, Campbell was already there. He was exasperated that there had been such confusion and that a 'good news' announcement on thousands of jobs at the Nissan car plant in Sunderland, due that week, was about to be overwhelmed. Mandelson started on his 'deliberately' forgot line while Blair looked on, sometimes gently shaking his head. 'Remember, Tony is a barrister and he wanted a cold long look at the facts,' said one Downing Street aide. 'When he had heard all the facts he came to a decision and that was that Peter had to go.' Campbell left after 10 minutes for the morning lobby briefing, aware that if he were too late the journalists would start putting two and two together. He said that the meeting upstairs was difficult and that he wasn't quite sure of the position. Thirty minutes later Blair told Mandelson that there was no way out. Mandelson emerged and made his resignation statement on the steps of Number 10. But he was not contrite, blaming the press for his downfall. Even then, Mandelson thought he would find a way back into politics. Speaking to a close friend on Friday evening, his sentiment was clear. 'This inquiry might be a lot more interesting than some people are saying. I would watch it with a great deal of interest.' He would not go gently into the good night. Mandelson could not help himself, letting it be known through friends that he would continue as MP for Hartlepool. His many enemies did not want that. They wanted him gone. For Good. Downing Street machinery has now made it clear that Mandelson had more than simply 'a moment of madness' when he lied to The Observer In a scathing attack on a Minister once described as Tony Blair's closest ally, senior sources have said there was growing concern 'over a number of weeks' about his 'lack of focus' and his 'non-attention' to detail. A Downing Street source described him as 'slightly detached'. The last time this phrase was used to journalists, Campbell was talking about Ron Davies, the Minister who was caught during a 'moment of madness' on Clapham Common in London. At No 10 there is exasperation that 'Peter is still up to his old tricks', as one official put it. Although Mandelson said he was tired of politics and no longer had the stomach for the fight, Blair allies blame him for a series of stories that have appeared detailing his feelings on the feuding with Gordon Brown. Privately, ministers say Mandelson's influence has been quietly waning for some time. The first outward sign came when Downing Street let it be known last autumn that he had been told off by Campbell for leaking a speech to a secret dinner of pro-euro businessmen, causing a political row that upstaged several Government announcements. It was the first time a dressing-down had been publicly administered. Then came complaints late last year from inside Millbank that Mandelson, busy in Northern Ireland, was too distant from the election campaign, leaving Brown an unexpectedly free rein. Downing Street, far from, as some suggest, kicking the Hammond report into the long grass until after the next General Election, want it to be published quickly. Downing Street aides say that Tony Blair is well aware of the mess John Major got into over cash for questions. The former PM tried to lance the sleazy boil by calling a rapid end to his Government before the parliamentary report on Neil Hamilton, brown envelopes and Mohammed Al Fayed could be published. So it ran like a festering sore throughout the campaign and simply served to remind the electorate about matters of Conservative wrong-doing. Then there is the role of Gordon Brown. His hand has been strengthened by Mandelson's demise. The emphasis will change. Brown will concentrate on core Labour values and prefers to have a few beers while watching football than going to opulent political parties as Mandelson did. Not before time, many back benchers argue. Labour's big problem at the next election will be getting out its core vote - the heartlands issue - and not the Mondeo Man swing voter. Brown's allies say that Mandelson went just as his version of the New Labour future was becoming less central to Blair's future. Mandelson's allies grumble that this is the 'death of the project'. But they should not over-egg that pudding. Brown is the arch pragmatist, the man who knows how to win elections. 'Gordon didn't get where he is today by simply saying he knows how to solve child poverty,' said one well placed Labour official. There will still be plenty of tummy tickling for Mondeo Man. Far from delight at Mandelson's fall, Brown grumbled that the man he barely speaks to had got Labour into 'another hole'. And the events of last week do not necessarily mean that Euro project so beloved by the member for Hartlepool is derailed either. Although Roger Liddle, the European enthusiast in Downing Street, has lost his biggest backer, Brown is a political animal like no other. He is sceptical about the value of the euro at present because it is useful, given the public's opinion, to be sceptical. 'Gordon will move rapidly if he sees that it is in our interest and that public opinion is moving,' said one key pro-European campaigner. Robin Cook, the Foreign Secretary who has surprised Blair, not a natural ally, during his performances in Nice, will still plug away at the pro-euro line. Mandelson will still float gently in the background, cajoling his friend the Prime Minister to seize his moment in history and join up. The referendum will be delayed, not forgotten. The excitable shouts of 'Resign!' from the Tory backbenches as Tony Blair faced the Commons on Wednesday might have been overly optimistic, but there is no doubt the week has boosted morale in Smith Square. William Hague's promise of an 'unrelenting' pursuit of more ministerial scalps and of Tony Blair's 'appalling error of judgment' in trusting Mandelson, in a speech to a reporters' luncheon on Thursday which was hurriedly rejigged to take account of events, illustrated his strategy for the next week. Although it had been pencilled in as the launch of big tax and spending initiatives, with two major Hague speeches on Tuesday and Wednesday, his most urgent mission now will be to try and convince voters it is not just Mandelson but New Labour as a whole that is dishonest. If he can make the charge stick, Central Office believes it could cost Labour seats. But Hague is walking a narrow tightrope nonetheless: not only have the Hindujas been Tory donors in the past, but some senior Tories are privately muttering that his vitriolic speech on Wednesday was over the top since Mandelson had already resigned and could have backfired. It certainly won Blair one ally in Charles Kennedy. The Liberal Democrat leader meant to kick off his Commons speech by demanding a strengthening of the ministerial code: instead he was so irritated by what he saw as Hague's lack of generosity that he opened with an unscripted and impromptu attack on the Conservatives. Blair has been left to wonder what exactly seized the Northern Ireland Secretary when he decided to hide the truth on Saturday afternoon about a matter that he had been aware of for many days. Campbell has said that Mandelson can't even explain it to himself. It was ticking time bomb that might never have gone off. But Mandelson was never predictable. As yesterday's attacks on Mandelson his former allies underlined, they are still concerned that the man dubbed the Prince of Darkness could emerge again to cast a long shadow over the Government's record.

      "body": "<p>Celebrations to mark Chinese New Year last week will probably have been conducted with more enthusiasm than usual by investors with money in China's stock markets. </p> <p>Shanghai was the best performing stock market in the world last year, rising by a massive 136 per cent </p> <p>Experts say the economy responded to the Chinese government's spending programme, which started in 1998. In 2000 there was a double-digit increase in electricity and gas consumption, retail spending was up 11 per cent year on year and industrial production is also in double-digit growth. </p> <p>However, investors hoping for a repeat performance should note that fund managers are cautious about prospects for 2001. </p> <p>Billy Chan, fund manager of Invesco's Hong Kong and China growth fund, says: 'I expect growth to slow down.' He cites the fall in retail spending in the fourth quarter of last year and the fact that China's application to the World Trade Organisation, hoped for this year, is proving more tricky than expected and may be put back. </p> <p>As a result Chan has decided to cut some of his fund's exposure to China, investing instead in Hong Kong companies that are likely to benefit from the drop in US interest rates, namely banks and property developers. </p> <p>His long-term forecast is rosier. He says: 'China has tremendous potential. The WTO membership will bring about lots of direct foreign investment due to cheap labour and generate competition between existing companies.' </p> <p>Independent financial adviser Hargreaves Lansdown agrees. Ben Yearsley says: 'China is a good long-term story because of the customer base. There are 1 billion people there, most without things like PlayStations or even Coke. </p> <p>'We are generally positive about China - just not at the moment. Not being in the WTO is holding them back and there is a danger that we are looking at last year's winner rather than this year's.' </p> <p>So it may pay to hold off investing in China until the economic situation becomes clear - unless you are prepared to make a long-term commitment. </p> <p>China is viewed by most investment advisers and fund managers as an emerging market. It is likely to be volatile, making it a high-risk for small investors. Holdings should form only a small proportion of your portfolio. </p> <p>Buying into the market through an investment trust or unit trust will reduce risk and fund managers Invesco and Aberdeen Asset Management, as well as HSBC, all have unit trusts offering access to China. </p> <p>Funds may take advantage of Chinese economic growth without risking direct investment. At Aberdeen International, Flavia Cheong, manager of the China Opportunities fund has had difficulty finding Chinese companies that meet her criteria so she selects Hong Kong companies with operations on the mainland. The fund is up 32.66 per cent over one year, 69.79 per cent over three and 158.3 per cent over five. </p> <p>Only experienced investors should consider buying individual shares in the Chinese market. But for those who recognise the risk, some Chinese companies look likely to do well this year. </p> <p>Stockbroker Brunswick Direct, which offers online trading in stocks in emerging market countries, has just opened for trading in the Chinese market allowing you to buy stocks in individual companies there. </p> <p>Brunswick recommendations include China Unicom, China Mobile - the world's third biggest mobile phone company - and Huaneng Power. </p> <p>Brunswick's head of investment banking Paul Luke predicts telecom stocks will grow 50 per cent in the next three to four months alone. A whopping 75 per cent of the Chinese population has never made a phone call but this is set to change. Every month, 2 million telephone lines are being installed and more than 2 million mobile phone subscriptions are taken out. </p> <p>Utility stocks are another good bet as growth in the economy will see energy demands soar, especially as Beijing strives to integrate its western provinces. Luke explains: 'As you expand, telecoms and power are what you need.' </p> <p>Foreigners who wish to buy Chinese stocks can do so either via the Hong Kong market or through the B markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen, which are exclusively for foreign investors. Brunswick advises a minimum investment of $1,000. Share transactions cost 0.75 per cent, with a minimum fee of $50. </p> <p>\u0095 Contact the broker on 0207 887 7112.</p>",

Shanghai was the best performing stock market in the world last year, rising by a massive 136 per cent Experts say the economy responded to the Chinese government's spending programme, which started in 1998. In 2000 there was a double-digit increase in electricity and gas consumption, retail spending was up 11 per cent year on year and industrial production is also in double-digit growth. However, investors hoping for a repeat performance should note that fund managers are cautious about prospects for 2001. Billy Chan, fund manager of Invesco's Hong Kong and China growth fund, says: 'I expect growth to slow down.' He cites the fall in retail spending in the fourth quarter of last year and the fact that China's application to the World Trade Organisation, hoped for this year, is proving more tricky than expected and may be put back. As a result Chan has decided to cut some of his fund's exposure to China, investing instead in Hong Kong companies that are likely to benefit from the drop in US interest rates, namely banks and property developers. His long-term forecast is rosier. He says: 'China has tremendous potential. The WTO membership will bring about lots of direct foreign investment due to cheap labour and generate competition between existing companies.' Independent financial adviser Hargreaves Lansdown agrees. Ben Yearsley says: 'China is a good long-term story because of the customer base. There are 1 billion people there, most without things like PlayStations or even Coke. 'We are generally positive about China - just not at the moment. Not being in the WTO is holding them back and there is a danger that we are looking at last year's winner rather than this year's.' So it may pay to hold off investing in China until the economic situation becomes clear - unless you are prepared to make a long-term commitment. China is viewed by most investment advisers and fund managers as an emerging market. It is likely to be volatile, making it a high-risk for small investors. Holdings should form only a small proportion of your portfolio. Buying into the market through an investment trust or unit trust will reduce risk and fund managers Invesco and Aberdeen Asset Management, as well as HSBC, all have unit trusts offering access to China. Funds may take advantage of Chinese economic growth without risking direct investment. At Aberdeen International, Flavia Cheong, manager of the China Opportunities fund has had difficulty finding Chinese companies that meet her criteria so she selects Hong Kong companies with operations on the mainland. The fund is up 32.66 per cent over one year, 69.79 per cent over three and 158.3 per cent over five. Only experienced investors should consider buying individual shares in the Chinese market. But for those who recognise the risk, some Chinese companies look likely to do well this year. Stockbroker Brunswick Direct, which offers online trading in stocks in emerging market countries, has just opened for trading in the Chinese market allowing you to buy stocks in individual companies there. Brunswick recommendations include China Unicom, China Mobile - the world's third biggest mobile phone company - and Huaneng Power. Brunswick's head of investment banking Paul Luke predicts telecom stocks will grow 50 per cent in the next three to four months alone. A whopping 75 per cent of the Chinese population has never made a phone call but this is set to change. Every month, 2 million telephone lines are being installed and more than 2 million mobile phone subscriptions are taken out. Utility stocks are another good bet as growth in the economy will see energy demands soar, especially as Beijing strives to integrate its western provinces. Luke explains: 'As you expand, telecoms and power are what you need.' Foreigners who wish to buy Chinese stocks can do so either via the Hong Kong market or through the B markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen, which are exclusively for foreign investors. Brunswick advises a minimum investment of $1,000. Share transactions cost 0.75 per cent, with a minimum fee of $50. \u0095 Contact the broker on 0207 887 7112.",

      "body": "<p>The perfect orange is something you come across by surprise on a grey January morning. Its flesh the colour of sunset, its juice at once both sweet and sharp. It may come from Italy, Spain or Morocco. It might be no bigger than a tennis ball. The perfect orange is unlikely to be very shiny and is just as inclined to come in a job lot from a barrow boy as it is to come cosseted in tissue. But there it is in your hand, a fruit so full of joy it makes you want to laugh out loud. </p> <p>There is much vulgarity in a modern orange - the neon vibrancy of its skin and juice as sweet as a glass of squash. Sad, too, the way they are piled high at the greengrocers, a long-life, indestructible commodity displayed, indifferent to season and without any hint to the fruit's exotic and fragrant roots. </p> <p>The orange tree bares its perfumed white flowers and its green and ripe fruit at the same time. The scent of the blossom is released as your hand brushes past on its way to pluck each fruit. The romance continues with the skin, which will, when punctured with a thumbnail, send fine spurts of aromatic mist into the cool air. Imagine these apricot-coloured fruits, their glossy green leaves and a single white blossom still attached, displayed in the shops like a rare and scented jewel. </p> <p>It is possible to rescue some of this fruit's mystery at the turn of the year when we have a choice: freckled 'bloods' with their sweet magenta juice; pungently sour 'marmalade' oranges from Seville; tiddly teardrop-shaped kumquats to eat, pip and all; and those pink-flecked Italian fruit, their deep yellow flesh dashed with carmine, as if splashed from a paint brush. Originally from China, and brought to Europe by the Arabs, an orange should be as special as a peach or a melon. </p> <p>Even the name has coarsened over the centuries. Three thousand years ago, it was known to the Indians as narayam ('perfume within'); the Arab traders called it narandj and took it to Spain ( naranja ) and Italy, where it became arancia . It took little to go from the French orange , still beautiful if you say it in a thick local accent, to the ugly English 'orindge'. No wonder we now pile it high and sell it cheap. </p> <p>The magic is still there, in the zest, the fragrant oil held in the outer layer of skin. It is the essence of the fruit and has the subtlety of the flower married with the spicy hint of bubbling marmalade. The peel is only worth using, finely grated as a flavouring for cakes, souffl\u00e9s and syrups, if the fruit has not been treated with wax for keeping. How many times have I seen an instruction to scrub the fruit well before use? Yet a good scrubbing will release almost as much of the precious oil as will a fine-toothed grater. A nail brush and some Fairy Liquid should not be on any recipe's ingredient list. Better, surely, to purchase untreated fruits. Grating oranges on a winter afternoon is high on that long list of Pleasures of the Kitchen. The pleasure stops with a bang as soon you catch a knuckle on the saw-teeth of the grater. </p> <p>I often add long strips of peel, carefully shorn to exclude any of the bitter white pith, into the poaching liquor for pears (Comice pears, water, sugar, a vanilla pod simmered till the pears are swollen and butter-soft), or in a rabbit stew with thyme and juniper berries. </p> <p>Citrus zest and juice are good with cake or pudding. The sharpness lifts the bland alchemy of butter, sugar, eggs and flour. This must be why marmalade tart is always such a treat. A favourite cake is that classic Moorish almond sponge, the one where the warm cake is left to soak in a thick syrup of orange juice and sugar with a drop of orangeblossom water. I applied this chemistry to a steamed pudding this week, firstly with marmalade in the bottom (too strong, it overpowered the subtlety of the sponge) and secondly with apricot jam. The latter worked like a dream, the sharp preserve flattering the grated zest and juice in the sponge. Then I made a jelly from blood oranges and cardamom seed, as different from the packet stuff as orangeblossom water is from Sunny Delight. </p> <p><strong> Steamed orange and lemon pudding</strong><br> </p> <p> A steamed pudding, with its magical chemistry of butter, sugar, eggs and flour, probably stands high on anyone's list of comfort cooking. But here you must also add the heavenly nip of apricot and citrus that wafts through the fuggy kitchen as it cooks. Such puddings are an occasional treat, so I think we can go for broke - I made mine with organic Welsh butter, organic caster sugar and flour, unwaxed oranges and lemons and the best French apricot preserve. Serious pleasure here. Serves 4-5. </p> <p><strong>125g soft butter </strong></p> <p><strong>125g golden caster sugar </strong></p> <p><strong>2 large eggs </strong></p> <p><strong>125g self-raising flour </strong></p> <p><strong>the grated zest and juice of 1 lemon </strong></p> <p><strong>the grated zest of two oranges, plus the juice of one of them </strong></p> <p><strong>180g good-quality apricot jam, such as Bonne Maman </strong></p> <p>Get the boring bit over first. Butter a 1 litre pudding basin and cut a piece of greaseproof paper large enough to cover the top with good room to spare (it will act as a hat to protect the pud as it steams). Cut a piece of tin foil or clean muslin which is large enough to go over the top of that, then find a few thick rubber bands and a piece of string. If you do this sort of thing regularly, you will probably already have the plastic steamed-pudding bowl with snap-on lid that dispenses with all this malarkey. </p> <p>Cream the butter and sugar in a food mixer or using a hand-held electric whisk until it is smooth and fluffy, then add the eggs, one at a time. Fold in the flour with a large metal spoon, then stir in the grated zest of the oranges and lemon. Squeeze the juice of the lemon and one of the oranges and gently, firmly fold it in. You are aiming for a texture that will fall from the spoon with a firm shake. If it appears to be getting sloppy, stop adding the juice. </p> <p>Spoon the jam into the bottom of the buttered basin, then smooth the sponge mixture over the top of it. Lay the prepared piece of greaseproof paper over the top, folding a finger-thick pleat across the middle as you do (this stops the paper splitting as the pudding rises), then secure it with a rubber band. Now tie the muslin or foil over that, first with the rubber band and then with the string. If the water gets in, you'll have a soggy pudding. </p> <p>Place the pudding basin in a very large saucepan and pour boiling water round it, coming almost halfway up the sides of the basin. Cover with a lid and let it steam for an hour and a half, topping up the water with boiling water from the kettle if and when it gets low. </p> <p>Switch the heat off and leave for a few minutes, before unwrapping and turning out.</p> <p><strong> Orange jelly with lemon and cardamom</strong><br> </p> <p> I get a childish kick out of serving jelly to adults. But they always enjoy it, and especially after a spicy meal. Use as little gelatine as you can get away with, so it shimmers, barely set, on the spoon. I use 7 sheets of gelatine to 1 litre of liquid, which means the finished dessert is too fragile to turn out, and I usually serve it in wine glasses. I add the extra one (leaf gelatine comes in packets of 8) when I am offering it to people who prefer their jelly to have a distinct wobble. The addition of cardamom is a subtle one and, I suppose, gives it a faintly Moorish tone. Enough for 8. </p> <p><strong>12 large and juicy oranges (to give just under 1 litre of juice) </strong></p> <p><strong>1 unwaxed pink grapefruit </strong></p> <p><strong>1 unwaxed lemon </strong></p> <p><strong>6 green cardamom pods </strong></p> <p><strong>7-8 sheets of gelatine </strong></p> <p>Squeeze the oranges. You need just under 1 litre of juice, so stop when you have enough, or do a few more if you stop very short of a full litre. Much will depend on the size, type and age of your fruit. </p> <p>Squeeze the grapefruit and the lemon, but keep the juice separate from the orange, then remove 3 or 4 strips of zest from each with a short sharp knife. Pour these juices into a small stainless-steel or enamelled saucepan with an equal quantity of water and drop in the pared zest. Split open the cardamom seeds by pressing gently on them with the flat of a large knife, then add them to the juice and bring it almost to a boil. As soon as the juice is about to start bubbling, cover it with a lid and turn off the heat. Leave the juice to cool a little - about 15 minutes should be long enough. </p> <p>Now slide the gelatine sheets - one or two at a time, rather than in a big lump - into a bowl of cold water, and let them soften for 5 minutes. </p> <p>Remove the lid, stopping for a second or two to breathe in the wonderful smell of citrus and cardamom, then pour through a sieve into a large, scrupulously clean bowl. Reserve the cardamom seeds. Lift the softened gelatine sheets from the water (they will be just short of dissolving), and stir them into the warm grapefruit and lemon juice. The gelatine will dissolve in seconds. </p> <p>Pour the orange juice into the grapefruit and lemon juice and stir thoroughly, making certain that every bit of gelatine has melted. Add the reserved cardamom pods into the juice - they will float around, apparently pointlessly, but will in fact discreetly give some of their flavour to the jelly as it sets. Refrigerate for a good 4 or 5 hours.</p>",

It took little to go from the French orange , still beautiful if you say it in a thick local accent, to the ugly English 'orindge'. No wonder we now pile it high and sell it cheap. The magic is still there, in the zest, the fragrant oil held in the outer layer of skin. It is the essence of the fruit and has the subtlety of the flower married with the spicy hint of bubbling marmalade. The peel is only worth using, finely grated as a flavouring for cakes, souffl\u00e9s and syrups, if the fruit has not been treated with wax for keeping. How many times have I seen an instruction to scrub the fruit well before use? Yet a good scrubbing will release almost as much of the precious oil as will a fine-toothed grater. A nail brush and some Fairy Liquid should not be on any recipe's ingredient list. Better, surely, to purchase untreated fruits. Grating oranges on a winter afternoon is high on that long list of Pleasures of the Kitchen. The pleasure stops with a bang as soon you catch a knuckle on the saw-teeth of the grater. I often add long strips of peel, carefully shorn to exclude any of the bitter white pith, into the poaching liquor for pears (Comice pears, water, sugar, a vanilla pod simmered till the pears are swollen and butter-soft), or in a rabbit stew with thyme and juniper berries. Citrus zest and juice are good with cake or pudding. The sharpness lifts the bland alchemy of butter, sugar, eggs and flour. This must be why marmalade tart is always such a treat. A favourite cake is that classic Moorish almond sponge, the one where the warm cake is left to soak in a thick syrup of orange juice and sugar with a drop of orangeblossom water. I applied this chemistry to a steamed pudding this week, firstly with marmalade in the bottom (too strong, it overpowered the subtlety of the sponge) and secondly with apricot jam. The latter worked like a dream, the sharp preserve flattering the grated zest and juice in the sponge. Then I made a jelly from blood oranges and cardamom seed, as different from the packet stuff as orangeblossom water is from Sunny Delight. Steamed orange and lemon pudding A steamed pudding, with its magical chemistry of butter, sugar, eggs and flour, probably stands high on anyone's list of comfort cooking. But here you must also add the heavenly nip of apricot and citrus that wafts through the fuggy kitchen as it cooks. Such puddings are an occasional treat, so I think we can go for broke - I made mine with organic Welsh butter, organic caster sugar and flour, unwaxed oranges and lemons and the best French apricot preserve. Serious pleasure here. Serves 4-5. 125g soft butter 125g golden caster sugar 2 large eggs 125g self-raising flour the grated zest and juice of 1 lemon the grated zest of two oranges, plus the juice of one of them 180g good-quality apricot jam, such as Bonne Maman Get the boring bit over first. Butter a 1 litre pudding basin and cut a piece of greaseproof paper large enough to cover the top with good room to spare (it will act as a hat to protect the pud as it steams). Cut a piece of tin foil or clean muslin which is large enough to go over the top of that, then find a few thick rubber bands and a piece of string. If you do this sort of thing regularly, you will probably already have the plastic steamed-pudding bowl with snap-on lid that dispenses with all this malarkey. Cream the butter and sugar in a food mixer or using a hand-held electric whisk until it is smooth and fluffy, then add the eggs, one at a time. Fold in the flour with a large metal spoon, then stir in the grated zest of the oranges and lemon. Squeeze the juice of the lemon and one of the oranges and gently, firmly fold it in. You are aiming for a texture that will fall from the spoon with a firm shake. If it appears to be getting sloppy, stop adding the juice. Spoon the jam into the bottom of the buttered basin, then smooth the sponge mixture over the top of it. Lay the prepared piece of greaseproof paper over the top, folding a finger-thick pleat across the middle as you do (this stops the paper splitting as the pudding rises), then secure it with a rubber band. Now tie the muslin or foil over that, first with the rubber band and then with the string. If the water gets in, you'll have a soggy pudding. Place the pudding basin in a very large saucepan and pour boiling water round it, coming almost halfway up the sides of the basin. Cover with a lid and let it steam for an hour and a half, topping up the water with boiling water from the kettle if and when it gets low. Switch the heat off and leave for a few minutes, before unwrapping and turning out. Orange jelly with lemon and cardamom I get a childish kick out of serving jelly to adults. But they always enjoy it, and especially after a spicy meal. Use as little gelatine as you can get away with, so it shimmers, barely set, on the spoon. I use 7 sheets of gelatine to 1 litre of liquid, which means the finished dessert is too fragile to turn out, and I usually serve it in wine glasses. I add the extra one (leaf gelatine comes in packets of 8) when I am offering it to people who prefer their jelly to have a distinct wobble. The addition of cardamom is a subtle one and, I suppose, gives it a faintly Moorish tone. Enough for 8. 12 large and juicy oranges (to give just under 1 litre of juice) 1 unwaxed pink grapefruit 1 unwaxed lemon 6 green cardamom pods 7-8 sheets of gelatine Squeeze the oranges. You need just under 1 litre of juice, so stop when you have enough, or do a few more if you stop very short of a full litre. Much will depend on the size, type and age of your fruit. Squeeze the grapefruit and the lemon, but keep the juice separate from the orange, then remove 3 or 4 strips of zest from each with a short sharp knife. Pour these juices into a small stainless-steel or enamelled saucepan with an equal quantity of water and drop in the pared zest. Split open the cardamom seeds by pressing gently on them with the flat of a large knife, then add them to the juice and bring it almost to a boil. As soon as the juice is about to start bubbling, cover it with a lid and turn off the heat. Leave the juice to cool a little - about 15 minutes should be long enough. Now slide the gelatine sheets - one or two at a time, rather than in a big lump - into a bowl of cold water, and let them soften for 5 minutes. Remove the lid, stopping for a second or two to breathe in the wonderful smell of citrus and cardamom, then pour through a sieve into a large, scrupulously clean bowl. Reserve the cardamom seeds. Lift the softened gelatine sheets from the water (they will be just short of dissolving), and stir them into the warm grapefruit and lemon juice. The gelatine will dissolve in seconds. Pour the orange juice into the grapefruit and lemon juice and stir thoroughly, making certain that every bit of gelatine has melted. Add the reserved cardamom pods into the juice - they will float around, apparently pointlessly, but will in fact discreetly give some of their flavour to the jelly as it sets. Refrigerate for a good 4 or 5 hours.",

I was so appalled by Asia de Cuba and Spoon, the other restaurants at Schrager's London hotels - by their grimly over-conceptualised food, by their obscene prices, by the casual stupidity of the staff - that, unsurprisingly, the promise of another one to review had me reaching only for the inkwell full of poison the better to dip my nib. The question was, could I resist its lure? </p> <p>Well no, at least not at first, though it must be said that my party was not exactly match fit. I'd had a crappy day and my companion, Kate, announced as she arrived that she was nursing an Olympic-quality case of PMT. All that said, Shrager's places do cry out to be kicked. The promotional material, for example, announced that at Tuscan Steak - branches of which already exist in Miami and New York - 'American beef would be featured'. Why? If you're going to start importing dead cow, what's wrong with Tuscan bloody beef, given the name and all? Or am I being too literal here? </p> <p>And then there are the prices: the wine list that has nothing below \u00a322 a bottle, the garlic bread at \u00a38.50. Oh, and of course there's the Tuscan steak, by way of America: it was the most expensive single dish I have ever seen on a menu, listed at 65 - count them - 65 of your pounds sterling. There was a cheaper option of a 28-day-hung Aberdeen Angus. It cost a mere \u00a340. Irritatingly, for two people ready to diss the place, we were then told - in classic Schrager speak - that the restaurant worked on 'a sharing concept'. Which in standard English means those steaks are for two. Thus the prices could be downgraded from crimes against humanity to mere acts of clumsy extortion. </p> <p>No matter. There were always the starters. Kate had the crab and potato cake with a lemon and chive butter sauce at \u00a38.50. She took a couple of mouthfuls and then squinted at me through a hormonal haze. 'It's really rather unpleasant,' she said. 'I'm not going to eat any more.' She was right; it was odd. It was as if the crab and potato hadn't been formally introduced and sat in layers, uncertain of each other. It also lacked any of the rich, fishy sweetness you expect from crab. My Tuscan antipasto at \u00a312.50 was, if anything, worse: it was the kind of thing you would find on a wedding buffet and eat only out of a desire not to offend the bride and groom. There were a couple of dull bean salads, some thick-cut Parma ham and a few sunblushed tomatoes. You could have bought it all on the deli counter at Sainsbury's for a couple of quid. Apart from the hummus, which was genuinely disgusting, and would never be allowed into Sainsbury's. It was salty and granular and little else. God knows what this little cultural non sequitur was doing on a Tuscan plate. </p> <p>So far, so bad. Now came the main course, the Aberdeen Angus beef. It arrived on a big wooden board, the T bone upended so that the down stroke of the 'T' pointed to the ceiling as though the dish were giving the finger to the room. It had been cooked rare, came pre-sliced for ease of sharing and was - damn it all - bloody marvellous. It wasn't the best steak I have ever eaten, but it was seriously close. Kate and I looked at each other as we chewed, our lips curling into a furious snarl. 'It's good, isn't it?' I said, bitterly. 'Yes,' she said, her jaw clenched. 'Damn good.' It had a rich, salty crust and was beautifully tender within. It was also more than enough for two. </p> <p>Thankfully, a side dish of tomato and rocket salad at \u00a34 arrived late and was nothing special. We had little room for pudding, so we shared a dish of roasted figs with honey ice cream. Oh sod it: that was also terrific, the delicately acid fruit breaking up on the spoon. As to the restaurant space, it was formerly a place called Saint M. Very little has been done to its dark wood cladding in the transformation, though a large stuffed bull's head now hangs on the wall to remind you of the noble beast you will soon help despatch. </p> <p>So could I actually recommend it? Oh, I really don't think I could go that far; old habits die hard, you know. Yes, the beef is brilliant. (There are, incidentally, vegetarian dishes, if you don't appreciate bloody meat, though why you'd be in a restaurant called Tuscan Steak if you were a vegetarian is a mystery to me.) And the most fat-walletted among us might just about be able to argue that at \u00a340 for two, the Aberdeen Angus beef is good value. But all in all, a restaurant costing this much should be able to deliver from the beginning of the menu to the very bottom and, on our night there, it simply didn't.

      "body": "<p> The pattern that is emerging from global warming is not just warm and wet. It is more complicated. We have higher than average temperatures but still get short periods of real cold - as we did after Christmas. Spring is tending to feel wet and cold, as is summer. In practice - and this is entirely based on my own observation - we still have hot days and we still have periods when the ground gets very dry (just as it did last September). </p> <p> My recollection of last summer was that it was generally a good one. But when I look back over my weather records, I see that it was very bitty. We had lots of good weather but it tended to come in single days or even parts of days. If you are outside most of the time, you can accommodate this variability, but if you only get out at weekends or in the evening, then the weather becomes a pig in a poke. The only constant has been a lingering dampness. In summer, this damp hardly reaches the ground. </p> <p> The air and foliage is wet, but the soil remains pretty dry. There were times last summer when it seemed as though there was an almost constant film of water on every surface. This is the perfect environment for fungi to thrive. Fungal problems are increasing in all gardens in the UK. They include blackspot - a result of too much unventilated damp on leaves - and grey mould, which is the consequence of too much unventilated dry.</p> <p> You can often see both fungal afflictions on the same rose bush. In the vegetable garden last summer, my cos lettuces were wet on top and consequentially suffered 'capping' - where a carapace of rotten leaves develops on top, trapping the good leaves below it - while the roots were covered in root aphids which only thrive in dry soil. And it is the vegetable garden that has suffered most at the slimy jaws of slugs and snails. The abnormally mild winters have resulted in a population explosion and conditions perfectly suited to both species. </p> <p> Slugs like the wet and snails need dry places to hide and breed in. Both situations are more than catered for. With most population explosions there is a natural plateauing out as the food supply fails. But in a garden, the food just keeps rolling in. Eaten all my lettuces? Better sow some more! Life for a slug at the turn of the millennium is a 50-course meal. But vengeance comes to those who wait. </p> <p>As I write, a blissfully frosty dawn is revealing itself and we have had a series of really cold days which will do more to control the slimy hordes than any amount of pellets. So much for the whinge. But if it is to be wet in terms of water levels in the soil, and if it is to be generally warmer than before, then vegetables are the greatest beneficiaries. Some 90 per cent of vegetables are water - they need it to grow and mature. Given that I am hopelessly unscientific and seemingly unable to be accurate beyond multiplications of my stride or span of finger and thumb, here are some published statistics from the National Vegetable Research Station: any vegetable crop will lose more than one gallon of water per square yard per sunny day.</p> <p> On a cool, cloudy day it will still lose a couple of pints from 'evapotranspiration'. An enormous amount of water passes through the plant and only a tiny percentage of it remains in it - although that tiny percentage makes up the vast majority of the mature vegetable. So, vegetables need and respond well to lots of water. But there are times when water does no good at all. If the growing plant can get the water it needs from a combination of the moisture reserve in the soil, lack of competition from weeds and lack of sunlight, extra water is not going to help the plant. </p> <p>There are also times when the plant needs less water to grow healthily. Vegetables need more water when flowering and fruiting, with the time period surprisingly critical - 24 hours, generally. A lack of water during this period will irreversibly affect the resulting crop. Don't assume that because the weather is damp and gloomy there is no need to water. The important thing is to water the right amount at the right time. Would that it were that simple. Different types of vegetables respond differently to different amounts of water at different times. Leafy veg, in general, grows more leaves in response to a steady water supply. So lettuce and cabbage will have a bigger harvest if the water is never checked. </p> <p> Roots, on the other hand, respond in the same way - by growing more leaves. But this does not necessarily mean more root. So you can conscientiously water your parsnips and carrots, see them repay this care with flourishing topknots but actually get no more food than if you had watered them less. With legume crops such as peas, broad beans and French beans, too much water when they are young will harm the crop, because energy will go into the plant, producing masses of vegetative growth and fewer pods. It is recommended that you do not water legumes at all once the seedlings are established. When they start to flower and produce pods, however, then you should hit them with water big time. </p> <p> This is also true of tomatoes, the squash family and sweetcorn. Watering new potatoes as they come into flower will dramatically increase the size of the crop and, at the same time, increase the maturity, so you can harvest them earlier. Water is obviously hugely influential in shaping the size and content of the harvest, but it also affects taste. In principle, the more water a vegetable has applied to it while it is growing, the less taste it will have. Does this mean that a harvest from crops such as rocket, mizuna, mibuna, Florence fennel or spring cabbage, all planted out and grown on throughout last autumn's hideous monsoon, will taste less good than normal? Yes. I tried to counter this by using cloches to protect some plants from the rain. </p> <p> Radicchio responds very well to an umbrella, as do herb crops such as thyme. I think that this brings us back, as ever, to the soil. If your soil has good structure and an annual addition of lots of organic matter, it will have the right balance between water retention when the roots need it and drainage when there is too much of the wet about. A good soil structure lets long, healthy roots develop, so the plant can grow fast and reach water and mineral reserves deeper down. The final point about global warming is that it affects our vegetables in just about the worst possible way. We have wet springs and autumns, stopping us from cultivating the soil and increasing fungal diseases and pests, and yet summers that produce wet air but dry ground - just when crops need water in good quantities at the base of the plant. </p> <p> <strong>Your roots - a guide to all-weather watering</strong><br></p> <p> Never let weeds develop, primarily because they rob the growing plants of precious water and therefore upset the balance of the relationship between the water supply and your vegetables' needs. It is particularly mad to water an unweeded crop, as effectively all you are doing is feeding the weeds - which are supremely efficient at grabbing and using all available water. </p> <p>Mulch vegetables just as you mulch the borders. This suppresses weed growth, reduces evaporation and slows down the water supply - useful when we get days of rain. Root crops benefit particularly from a mulch, because the best way to water them is with a good soak about once every 10 days (which, given our weather, is likely to come from rain), but never to let the soil dry out. Even if it is very hot, a thick mulch will hold moisture for a week before you water again. </p> <p>Always water the base of any plant - but not as a general spray or mist of water, most of which will evaporate in hot weather or simply cool the plant rather than irrigate it. </p> <p> <strong>My roots</strong><br></p> <p>The garden is currently riddled through with holes, like a lump of Gruy\u00e8re cheese. Thousands of them. Voles are the culprit - voles by the thousand. I thought the flooding might have driven them away, but, instead, it seems to have created a subterranean vole ranch. The little sods nibble at the roots of everything, chew up tulip bulbs and, yesterday, I noticed that three-quarters of a quite large pleached lime had had its bark gnawed off just below ground level. Another couple of inches and it would have been killed. </p> <p>The cats catch dozens of them, which they deposit, headless, on the doorstep, but that will hardly dent the population. Voles tend to have population explosions, so I can only hope that this is the big bang and that there will be a few years of vole fall-out as a result. On the basis of know-your-enemy, I was reading everything I could about voles and discovered that an adult vole eats its own weight in dry food every week and, less surprisingly in light of this revelation, that they can pass over 1,000 droppings a day. </p> <p>Because we have had almost a week of frost, the ground is dry for the first time since September. Assuming that the weather will almost certainly be worse, I have been barrowing loads of mushroom compost all over the garden and making piles wherever it is likely to be needed. This is impossible in the wet, as the mess that a full barrow makes creates more harm than the good of the process. </p> <p>I used to belong to the 'mustn't-mulch-unless-the-soil-is-warm-and-wet' school, but have chucked that out. My New Year's resolution is: don't waste time on what you can't do, and do what you can do now. So, the borders get mulched in January frost and I am sure they will be fine, albeit colder for a little longer. Also, by the time that you read this I will have begun a long bout of filming - so I must get ahead of the jobs as and when I can, regardless of weather. </p> <p>I pruned the autumn-fruiting raspberries, which is one of those jobs that measure out January for me, in the same way that summer-pruning the espalier pears belongs to July. With the secateurs warmed up, I went round all the hornbeam hedges fine-pruning them. I did this last January and was surprised how much difference it made. Any deciduous hedge would do, and it means they enter the growing season at the right height and form, and also gives you a chance to give each plant the once-over. </p>",

      "bodyText": "The pattern that is emerging from global warming is not just warm and wet. It is more complicated. We have higher than average temperatures but still get short periods of real cold - as we did after Christmas. Spring is tending to feel wet and cold, as is summer. In practice - and this is entirely based on my own observation - we still have hot days and we still have periods when the ground gets very dry (just as it did last September). My recollection of last summer was that it was generally a good one. But when I look back over my weather records, I see that it was very bitty. We had lots of good weather but it tended to come in single days or even parts of days. If you are outside most of the time, you can accommodate this variability, but if you only get out at weekends or in the evening, then the weather becomes a pig in a poke. The only constant has been a lingering dampness. In summer, this damp hardly reaches the ground. The air and foliage is wet, but the soil remains pretty dry. There were times last summer when it seemed as though there was an almost constant film of water on every surface. This is the perfect environment for fungi to thrive. Fungal problems are increasing in all gardens in the UK. They include blackspot - a result of too much unventilated damp on leaves - and grey mould, which is the consequence of too much unventilated dry. You can often see both fungal afflictions on the same rose bush. In the vegetable garden last summer, my cos lettuces were wet on top and consequentially suffered 'capping' - where a carapace of rotten leaves develops on top, trapping the good leaves below it - while the roots were covered in root aphids which only thrive in dry soil. And it is the vegetable garden that has suffered most at the slimy jaws of slugs and snails. The abnormally mild winters have resulted in a population explosion and conditions perfectly suited to both species. Slugs like the wet and snails need dry places to hide and breed in. Both situations are more than catered for. With most population explosions there is a natural plateauing out as the food supply fails. But in a garden, the food just keeps rolling in. Eaten all my lettuces? Better sow some more! Life for a slug at the turn of the millennium is a 50-course meal. But vengeance comes to those who wait. As I write, a blissfully frosty dawn is revealing itself and we have had a series of really cold days which will do more to control the slimy hordes than any amount of pellets. So much for the whinge. But if it is to be wet in terms of water levels in the soil, and if it is to be generally warmer than before, then vegetables are the greatest beneficiaries. Some 90 per cent of vegetables are water - they need it to grow and mature. Given that I am hopelessly unscientific and seemingly unable to be accurate beyond multiplications of my stride or span of finger and thumb, here are some published statistics from the National Vegetable Research Station: any vegetable crop will lose more than one gallon of water per square yard per sunny day. On a cool, cloudy day it will still lose a couple of pints from 'evapotranspiration'. An enormous amount of water passes through the plant and only a tiny percentage of it remains in it - although that tiny percentage makes up the vast majority of the mature vegetable. So, vegetables need and respond well to lots of water. But there are times when water does no good at all. If the growing plant can get the water it needs from a combination of the moisture reserve in the soil, lack of competition from weeds and lack of sunlight, extra water is not going to help the plant. There are also times when the plant needs less water to grow healthily. Vegetables need more water when flowering and fruiting, with the time period surprisingly critical - 24 hours, generally. A lack of water during this period will irreversibly affect the resulting crop. Don't assume that because the weather is damp and gloomy there is no need to water. The important thing is to water the right amount at the right time. Would that it were that simple. Different types of vegetables respond differently to different amounts of water at different times. Leafy veg, in general, grows more leaves in response to a steady water supply. So lettuce and cabbage will have a bigger harvest if the water is never checked. Roots, on the other hand, respond in the same way - by growing more leaves. But this does not necessarily mean more root. So you can conscientiously water your parsnips and carrots, see them repay this care with flourishing topknots but actually get no more food than if you had watered them less. With legume crops such as peas, broad beans and French beans, too much water when they are young will harm the crop, because energy will go into the plant, producing masses of vegetative growth and fewer pods. It is recommended that you do not water legumes at all once the seedlings are established. When they start to flower and produce pods, however, then you should hit them with water big time. This is also true of tomatoes, the squash family and sweetcorn. Watering new potatoes as they come into flower will dramatically increase the size of the crop and, at the same time, increase the maturity, so you can harvest them earlier. Water is obviously hugely influential in shaping the size and content of the harvest, but it also affects taste. In principle, the more water a vegetable has applied to it while it is growing, the less taste it will have. Does this mean that a harvest from crops such as rocket, mizuna, mibuna, Florence fennel or spring cabbage, all planted out and grown on throughout last autumn's hideous monsoon, will taste less good than normal? Yes. I tried to counter this by using cloches to protect some plants from the rain. Radicchio responds very well to an umbrella, as do herb crops such as thyme. I think that this brings us back, as ever, to the soil. If your soil has good structure and an annual addition of lots of organic matter, it will have the right balance between water retention when the roots need it and drainage when there is too much of the wet about. A good soil structure lets long, healthy roots develop, so the plant can grow fast and reach water and mineral reserves deeper down. The final point about global warming is that it affects our vegetables in just about the worst possible way. We have wet springs and autumns, stopping us from cultivating the soil and increasing fungal diseases and pests, and yet summers that produce wet air but dry ground - just when crops need water in good quantities at the base of the plant. Your roots - a guide to all-weather watering Never let weeds develop, primarily because they rob the growing plants of precious water and therefore upset the balance of the relationship between the water supply and your vegetables' needs. It is particularly mad to water an unweeded crop, as effectively all you are doing is feeding the weeds - which are supremely efficient at grabbing and using all available water. Mulch vegetables just as you mulch the borders. This suppresses weed growth, reduces evaporation and slows down the water supply - useful when we get days of rain. Root crops benefit particularly from a mulch, because the best way to water them is with a good soak about once every 10 days (which, given our weather, is likely to come from rain), but never to let the soil dry out. Even if it is very hot, a thick mulch will hold moisture for a week before you water again. Always water the base of any plant - but not as a general spray or mist of water, most of which will evaporate in hot weather or simply cool the plant rather than irrigate it. My roots The garden is currently riddled through with holes, like a lump of Gruy\u00e8re cheese. Thousands of them. Voles are the culprit - voles by the thousand. I thought the flooding might have driven them away, but, instead, it seems to have created a subterranean vole ranch. The little sods nibble at the roots of everything, chew up tulip bulbs and, yesterday, I noticed that three-quarters of a quite large pleached lime had had its bark gnawed off just below ground level. Another couple of inches and it would have been killed. The cats catch dozens of them, which they deposit, headless, on the doorstep, but that will hardly dent the population. Voles tend to have population explosions, so I can only hope that this is the big bang and that there will be a few years of vole fall-out as a result. On the basis of know-your-enemy, I was reading everything I could about voles and discovered that an adult vole eats its own weight in dry food every week and, less surprisingly in light of this revelation, that they can pass over 1,000 droppings a day. Because we have had almost a week of frost, the ground is dry for the first time since September. Assuming that the weather will almost certainly be worse, I have been barrowing loads of mushroom compost all over the garden and making piles wherever it is likely to be needed. This is impossible in the wet, as the mess that a full barrow makes creates more harm than the good of the process. I used to belong to the 'mustn't-mulch-unless-the-soil-is-warm-and-wet' school, but have chucked that out. My New Year's resolution is: don't waste time on what you can't do, and do what you can do now. So, the borders get mulched in January frost and I am sure they will be fine, albeit colder for a little longer. Also, by the time that you read this I will have begun a long bout of filming - so I must get ahead of the jobs as and when I can, regardless of weather. I pruned the autumn-fruiting raspberries, which is one of those jobs that measure out January for me, in the same way that summer-pruning the espalier pears belongs to July. With the secateurs warmed up, I went round all the hornbeam hedges fine-pruning them. I did this last January and was surprised how much difference it made. Any deciduous hedge would do, and it means they enter the growing season at the right height and form, and also gives you a chance to give each plant the once-over.",

Claims that Ministers were unaware of the Hinduja brothers' business activities, currently at the centre of a massive corruption inquiry in India, were undermined last night when it emerged that British intelligence gave the Bank of England information about the Hindujas when the brothers applied for a banking licence in 1996.

      "body": "<p>The plotters would meet several times a month in different locations across White City. And from tiny acorns huge oak trees grow. Throughout 1999 a small cabal of strategists had been given a simple task by then-Director General, John Birt - to work out how the BBC could turn the plethora of new technologies emerging at the time into cool, hard cash. </p> <p>BBC insiders knew of the the group, but few were privy to their ideas. The plotters organised a series of clandestine conferences, all code-named 'Hever' and which were attended by some of the brightest brains advising the corporation. Their conclusions were fed back directly to Birt. </p> <p>Auntie was nervous about what would happen if Hever's results leaked into the public domain. They exposed huge rifts at the heart of the BBC. In one corner was the old guard, opposed to an increasingly commercialised BBC. In the other was the younger contingent, who viewed the corporation as a fusty relic urgently in need of an overhaul. </p> <p>Numerous plans were dreamt up. A free internet service provider was one option. But by the time the corporation got round to looking at launching a service, electrical retail giant Dixons had blown competitors out of the water with Freeserve. Then there was the proposal to float off the BBC's internet division on the stock market. But by the time Auntie had squared the move with her public service conscience the value of tech stocks had crashed and the move was dropped. 'The BBC has got the right idea but it's always been following the field. It takes a long time for it to make decisions and they all have to be given policy spins,' said one Hever source. </p> <p>But some Hever plans are now finding their way on to the desk of Greg Dyke, the BBC's commercially savvy new sheriff, who is charged with finding Auntie an extra \u00a3400 million to meet the costs of programming between 2002 and 2006. </p> <p>'John was always trying come up with a theoretical model to explain why we could do something commercial,' a BBC source said. 'Greg is much more, \"f *** it, let's see what we can get away with\".' </p> <p>Last week it became clear just how far Dyke thinks he can go. The BBC admitted that it was studying a plan to display advertising on a yet-to-be built international news website, BBCNews.com. The announcement sent shock waves through the media world.

      "bodyText": "The plotters would meet several times a month in different locations across White City. And from tiny acorns huge oak trees grow. Throughout 1999 a small cabal of strategists had been given a simple task by then-Director General, John Birt - to work out how the BBC could turn the plethora of new technologies emerging at the time into cool, hard cash. BBC insiders knew of the the group, but few were privy to their ideas. The plotters organised a series of clandestine conferences, all code-named 'Hever' and which were attended by some of the brightest brains advising the corporation. Their conclusions were fed back directly to Birt. Auntie was nervous about what would happen if Hever's results leaked into the public domain. They exposed huge rifts at the heart of the BBC. In one corner was the old guard, opposed to an increasingly commercialised BBC. In the other was the younger contingent, who viewed the corporation as a fusty relic urgently in need of an overhaul. Numerous plans were dreamt up. A free internet service provider was one option. But by the time the corporation got round to looking at launching a service, electrical retail giant Dixons had blown competitors out of the water with Freeserve. Then there was the proposal to float off the BBC's internet division on the stock market. But by the time Auntie had squared the move with her public service conscience the value of tech stocks had crashed and the move was dropped. 'The BBC has got the right idea but it's always been following the field. It takes a long time for it to make decisions and they all have to be given policy spins,' said one Hever source. But some Hever plans are now finding their way on to the desk of Greg Dyke, the BBC's commercially savvy new sheriff, who is charged with finding Auntie an extra \u00a3400 million to meet the costs of programming between 2002 and 2006. 'John was always trying come up with a theoretical model to explain why we could do something commercial,' a BBC source said. 'Greg is much more, \"f *** it, let's see what we can get away with\".' Last week it became clear just how far Dyke thinks he can go. The BBC admitted that it was studying a plan to display advertising on a yet-to-be built international news website, BBCNews.com. The announcement sent shock waves through the media world. Commercial rivals are screaming that what will start out as a bit of banner advertising on a website aimed at overseas internet surfers will quickly spread to all of the corporation's activities. 'This is the thinnest edge of the biggest wedge you could find.

We're back, one more time, to the problem of what the Guardian's Roy Greenslade calls 'the incredible bulk'; and thus to the quagmire of newspaper circulation statistics. What's real and what's confected? </p> <p>Greenslade thinks he knows. Bulks are 'the piles of papers one finds at airports, fast-food outlets or betting shops. They are the papers left outside your hotel room or handed out as you get on to a plane.' These giveaways, he says, should 'not be regarded as real sales and should not form part of the headline total'. His own reporting of ABC monthly circulation totals will henceforth leave the bulks stacked to one side. </p> <p>Fair enough? Sure, at first glance: sales are sales are sales. But journey a little further into this swamp and ask more basic questions. Who are these circulation figures for? What purpose are they intended to serve? Are they designed to make editors or publishers feel virtuous? To impress readers? Or to tell advertisers what they're getting for their money? There's no doubt, in history or current practice, where the crucial emphasis lies. </p> <p>These statistics - together with the results of the National Readership Survey - are an advertising tool. Display ad rates, indeed, tend to be pegged to specific targets, so that if the Express or the Telegraph dips definitively below the 1 million mark the rates they can charge dip, too. Hard cash: hard times. </p> <p>But here's a funny thing. Newspapers' use of bulks can vary hugely - in December the Daily Express churned out 52,000 a day and the Sun just 2,000 - but there is no hint of such discrepancies in the readership figures. </p> <p>The number of readers per copy for the Telegraph (which is big on bulks) and the Guardian (which is traditionally small) does not seem one jot affected. Maybe a good deal with the right airline can nudge your AB business readership up a tad - marketing departments traditionally think so - but that's because the bulks BA or Virgin dole out have been read and the ads duly scanned. </p> <p>A wide-awake advertising space buyer, in short, needs the NRS and the ABC together to have any clear take on value for money. Bulks don't affect such clarity. They are just part of the parcel - and ad agencies themselves are pretty used to bargain offers and direct mailings and samples (because customers use them all the time).That would not hold true, of course, if a reliance on bulks showed up on the NRS; but, if it doesn't, without obvious correlation, then there's not much to get steamed up about. </p> <p>More confusingly still, consider the new growth of Associated's Metro titles, papers with national reach actually given away every morning. Roy Greenslade (like other commentators) admires the progress they've made: a guaranteed 1 million distributed every morning isn't so far away. Yet what, in truth, is the difference between a pile of Metros outside your railway station and a pile of Daily Mails in your hotel lobby? Associated doesn't draw any moral lines: it aims to make profits either way. </p> <p>There used to a rough rule of thumb that held that something the customer paid for was more valuable than something that cost nothing: thus, that ads in paid-for papers were more valuable than those in the frees. But it's difficult to run that distinction any longer. Take New York this winter (finally catching up on the Metro wave). Is an ad in the Express there (the Daily News ' new afternoon subway freesheet) worth almost nothing, while an ad in Rupert Murdoch's Post has suddenly become worth much more? The Express distributes 125,000 copies a day; the Post , meanwhile, costs 25 cents, just half of what it did before the freesheet competition began. </p> <p>Imponderable territory. Is any cover price, no matter how slashed, worth more to an advertiser than no price at all? Is an ad in the London Evening Standard on one of its 10p days worth a fraction of a 35p day? It's not an argument worth beginning, let alone pursuing. </p> <p>Reckon, rather, that advertising is full of big, grown-up boys and girls who can be trusted to find their own way through this swamp. So we're back to the two other uses of circulation figures, defining what newspapers tell their readers, and themselves. </p> <p>Well, of course, it's nice to be honest with your readers. They expect it. But the Court of Last Resort could sit forever trying to find a way through these thickets. Is the bulk Telegraph the Lord Chief Justice reads on his train less sanctified than the cut-price Independent he doesn't touch? </p> <p>Is a subscription copy, paid for in advance, less noble than one where coins pass across a counter?

Everybody, the entire pack, can exclude the dead days between Christmas and New Year. Everybody can pretend they didn't happen (except in some very small print at the back of the ABC book). </p> <p>One day, perhaps, the NRS and ABC will get together and do something simple and pure and wholly informative.

Figures soon to be released by global internet research firm Jupiter MMXI show that over the crucial Christmas period Lastminute failed to expand what is known in the industry as its 'reach' - the company's share of the total internet population. The company's website attracted more than 500,000 visitors last December, 200,000 more than in the same month the previous year. But as more and more consumers have ventured onto the internet over the last year, Lastminute's reach has remained static. Jupiter's research shows that the company's share of the internet population in December was 4.2 per cent, only 0.1 per cent up on its position the previous Christmas. Alternative figures released by Nielsen/NetRatings show that in June last year Lastminute was attracting more than 485,000 visitors - but this had fallen to 354,000 by December. Nick Jones, senior analyst with Jupiter, said: 'The good news is it hasn't gone down. That would have been very disappointing. But the question is what group are they targeting?

'All the traditional retailers are online now; you don't have to visit Lastminute.' Earlier this month the company told The Observer it was happy with its Christmas trading figures and would give a fuller update at its next set of results.

      "body": "<p>The decision could not have come at a worse time for Julie. The 17-year-old had managed to find a precious place in a homeless hostel in Edinburgh, the first step to getting her off the streets and away from the life of prostitution and minor drug abuse she was beginning to drift into. Then she was caught using heroin and alcohol in the hostel and the lifeline of a bed indoors was immediately torn away . </p> <p>Although she pleaded to be allowed to stay in the hostel, although she explained that was the first time she had touched heroin and promised never to touch it again, although she told staff about the prostitution, about being attacked in the street, about her terror at the prospect of being roofless again, Julie was given 48 hours. She had broken the rules once, and that was as many chances as she was going to get. </p> <p>Julie's experience is just one of many harrowing cases to be revealed this week in a groundbreaking study of Edinburgh's struggle to get to grips with its homelessness problem. The report, which has been seen by The Observer ahead of its publication tomorrow, paints a grim picture: despite a \u00a310m cash injection from the Government's much-trumpeted Rough Sleepers' Initiative, the city's claims of success in tackling the issue are undermined by evidence of woefully inadequate hostel and care provision, spiralling drug abuse and an appalling toll of preventable deaths. </p> <p>The most disturbing finding of all is that Edinburgh's problems are far from unique; in towns and cities across the UK, those forced to sleep outdoors are facing the same uphill battle for a roof as their counterparts in Edinburgh. </p> <p>The Government launched its Rough Sleepers' Initiative in 1997 with the aim of getting homeless people into accommodation so that by the end of 2003 rough sleeping would be eradicated. Halfway down the line, the new study, carried out by the Edinburgh Streetwork Project (ESP) with the backing of Shelter Scotland over the course of 12 months, is a graphic illustration of just how much more needs to be achieved before that target is met. 'The findings were not a shock to us in the respect that we are working on these streets every day,' Tam Hendry, the ESP's general manager and one of the report's authors, told The Observer . </p> <p>'The shock has been how difficult it has been to communicate the scale of the problem and have it taken seriously. </p> <p>'Edinburgh happened to be the city we looked at, but other places cannot afford to sit back and be complacent. The issues we identify will be repeated across the country. The problem with a national strategy aiming to reduce rough sleeping by a set date is that there is a tendency to go for simplistic, one-size-fits-all solutions. In fact, the situation is far more complex.' </p> <p>Since being awarded \u00a310m from the Rough Sleepers' Initiative, Edinburgh has managed to cut the number of people sleeping on the streets at any one time by about 100. </p> <p>But the study, the first in-depth examination of the initiative in practice anywhere in the country, reveals that these gains may be less impressive than they appear at first glance. In fact, the report shows that the number of hostel beds available in the city has gone down by about 130 since 1997. According to the city council, this should be a matter of celebration, proof that fewer people are in need of emergency accommodation. But translate that figure into harsh experience for those trying to get off the street and the full meaning becomes clear. </p> <p>Between April and October 1999, only 14 per cent of those ESP workers referred to a hostel managed to find a bed. The report found that, over a three-month period between May and July that year, there was only a one-in-four chance of finding a vacancy. For men, there were only eight days per month when a vacancy was available; for women, there was one vacancy every day in May, 15 days in June and only six in July. </p> <p>'It is unforgivable that Edinburgh has reduced the number of hostel bed spaces,' said Hendry. 'We appreciate that the council is aiming to provide quality accommodation, and that there are problems with property prices and the not-in-my-backyard attitude, but they are going to have to, as a matter of priority, get the number of beds up so people at least have somewhere to go to get off the street.' </p> <p>So if those sleeping rough cannot get hostel accommodation, how has Edinburgh managed to reduce the numbers? The report shows that this success may, in large part, be accounted for by a similar increase in the numbers of those spending the night in 24-hour centres without sleeping facilities. A considerable number used the Cowgate Centre, in the heart of the Old Town, for example. It has a caf\u00e9, television room and pool table. But no beds. </p> <p>'It is like something out of Victorian times,' said Hendry. 'People crushed up on chairs or lying on the floor trying to sleep and stay warm. It is progress in that people are not outside, but it is very tenuous progress. They are only a step away from the street, and that is not enough.' </p> <p>The implications for the homeless of not being unable to find a hostel space are more serious than being forced to spend another freezing night outdoors, according to Liz Nicholson, director of Shelter Scotland. </p> <p>'Being turned away from hostels or services is a frustrating experience for anyone, but more so if you literally have nowhere else to turn. Except maybe to your \"new best friend\" who is more interested in developing your drug habit than solving your housing problems.' This fact is confirmed all too conclusively by the report. Workers at ESP received twice as many requests for help in relation to drugs problems between April and October 2000 than they did in the same period in 1999. There was almost a 20 per cent increase in those seeking help for heroin abuse; 65 per cent of whom were from people under 35 and 35 per cent were from those under 25. But as Julie's case proved, many of the hostels are either unwilling or not equipped to cope. </p> <p>'The problem is that the wrong thinking has been applied to the provision of hostel care, particularly for young people,' Hendry said. 'The attitude is that when people manage to access accommodation, they should take what they are given and they should abide by the rules, otherwise they are out. There is a completely intolerant attitude and that will require a big cultural change.' For those who are left on the streets, especially vulnerable young people with drugs or mental health problems, the outlook remains bleak, despite the \u00a310m investment. Over the course of the last 17 months, 14 homeless people have died in Edinburgh, an appalling death rate of almost one a month. </p> <p>For Hendry and other drugs workers, this is the evidence that is most difficult to deal with. 'The hardest thing about this job is having people you have been working with, and trying to help, die. You can tell who is going to be next because they are not getting the support they need, but there is nothing you can do about it. That is why the Rough Sleepers' Initiative has to be made to work.'</p>",

The Spectator editor's love of automobiles puts Two Jags to shame and he regularly test drives cars for his column in GQ; last Sunday he took a Ferrari 456GT for a spin. Unfortunately, on the way home he ran out of petrol. In the fast lane of the M40. In the end, the police had to pick him up. Sadly, this has not been the only blot on his copybook at GQ.

One of her first appearances in print was in the Daily Mail on 1 October 1997, where she claimed: 'Professional counselling is largely a waste of time.' This article was based on a September 1997 piece in the Telegraph , where McEwan opined: 'Counselling does more harm than good.' In the same month the omnipresent McEwan repeated these views in the Evening Standard; her opinion was recycled in a caustic tirade by Victor Lewis-Smith in the Mirror on 5 August 2000. The professor turns up in Dr Phil Hammond's Daily Express column for 14 November 2000; Lynda Lee Potter, in the Daily Mail, has repeatedly quoted McEwan - 'Evidently counselling people after a tragedy can do more harm than good' - most recently on 11 January. Tragically, for those who need a drop of McEwan to pep up their copy, Fife University does not exist. There is a Fife College.

      "body": "<p>As an 11-year-old boy, Dominic Lawson held a small glass under the bleeding foot of his sister Thomasina who had been cut in an accident. That night, he placed the vessel on the window sill of his bedroom, overlooking a graveyard, in order to see if vampires would pay him a visit. Even for a boy with the initials DRCL - Dracula without the vowels, as detractors point out - the gesture was curious. But it hardly meant the eccentric 11-year-old should inevitably one day graduate to a world of invisible ink, poisoned dart umbrellas and telephone box assignations on the platforms of suburban railway stations. </p> <p>Lawson, editor of the Sunday Telegraph and former editor of the Spectator, has always attracted attention. Part of a family with a constellation of contacts - his father is politician Nigel and his sister the columnist and cookery writer Nigella - he has already been mythologised as a sharp, demanding Fleet Street operator at just 44. With an eclectic circle of friends and interests, he inspires strong reactions for not always predictable views. </p> <p>The most vehement reactions this weekend have been from Lawson himself, accused once again of being an assistant to the security services. Lawson is not just another journalist, according to aggrieved ex-MI6 agent Richard Tomlinson. In an improbable memoir, The Big Breach, now published in Russia, Tomlinson elaborates on claims he first made in 1998, that a newspaper editor is 'Smallbrow', provider of cover to MI6 operatives in troublespots abroad. One MI6 officer allegedly posed as a Spectator freelancer when on an undercover mission to Estonia, with the assistance of the Spectator 's then editor. And Tomlinson himself now insists he was given a letter of introduction by Lawson when he too posed as a Spectator contributor, on a covert mission to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. </p> <p>The use of journalistic credentials as a cloak for espionage is hardly a new modus operandi. (Fastidious Observer readers will be the first to point out that half a century ago Kim Philby used his credentials from this paper as cover too.) But the entirely unproven claim deeply damages Lawson, not only because he has built his career on the basis of being one sceptical step apart from the establishment with which he is so well connected. Much more worrying is the fate that might await a reporter carrying a bona fide commission from him in, say, Kabul or Baghdad. </p> <p>'It is complete rubbish that I gave journalistic cover to an MI6 officer who wanted to go to Tallin,' insisted a furious Lawson. He does admit to some embarrassment that an 'aid worker' in Kosovo penned two pieces for the Spectator in 1994, countering widespread sympathy for the Bosnian Muslims by emphasising that atrocities had occurred 'on all sides', a view the Foreign Office was keen to promote. It turned out that 'Kenneth Roberts' worked for the security services. 'I simply didn't know,' Lawson insists. </p> <p>But Lawson's most awkward moment came two years ago, when Labour MP Brian Sedgemore named him in Parliament as an MI6 operative. The suggestion, again made without the benefit of any corroborating evidence, was popular at the time - few on the Left forget that it was Lawson who exposed Guardian journalist Richard Gott as on the payroll of the KGB. Sedgemore declined to repeat the claim without Parliamentary privilege. </p> <p>But in a catalogue of supposition, rumour and innuendo, there appears to be no evidence whatsoever suggesting that Lawson is a spy. Now his most helpful demonstration of support has come from an unlikely source. Tomlinson's book, as is de rigueur with new publications, is spiced with further celebrity 'revelations'. Not only was Lawson an MI6 agent, it claims, Nelson Mandela was too. Yesterday Mr Mandela condemned the work as a 'disgraceful fabrication'. </p> <p>Lawson remains a prickly enigma, even to those close to him. For the last decade he has been married to Rosa Monckton, the Asprey &amp; Garrard boss whose salary is reported to match that of her partner. The marriage has - according to one friend - been the making of Lawson. 'It was instantaneous. They went off to dinner after a party and never looked back.' </p> <p>Rosa hosts dinners at which close friends - including the Hagues, Michael Howard and Ruby Wax - are entertained assiduously. 'Rosa is a source of much subtle influence upon him,' says a regular diner. 'You can see her expanding his horizons very determinedly.' </p> <p>Monckton also introduced Lawson to her friend Diana, Princess of Wales. On one occasion, the high windows of London's Kensington Gardens twinkled with the reflection of opera glasses as Lawson accompanied the Princess for a stroll, appearing to advise and counsel. The relationship will have come more easily to Monckton, whose grandfather counselled Edward VIII during his abdication crisis, keeping the Windsors on side at the same time. </p> <p>Lawson does play the gentleman, not always to the satisfaction of some more socially demanding acquaintances. He has been spotted in London wearing 'bright straw-coloured corduroys', an unforgivable faux pas in the eyes of some. But while enjoying life in the inside lane, Lawson is undoubtedly an outsider too. There has never been a full explanation of why he left Eton after one term for the more cerebral Westminster. 'He was unhappy, that's that,' says Nigella. But in the political party and society to which he was born, anti-semitism is not unknown. </p> <p>Personal tragedy may well have hardened him. His mother died early, of cancer, as did his sister, Thomasina. His brother-in-law, John Diamond, is dying of throat cancer. </p> <p>Lawson is also driven, as are many sons of the successful, by a wish to be not just loved but also admired by his father. 'After some of his greatest scoops, he has rung Nigel just hoping for a word of acknowledgement,' disclosed a friend. 'It's pointless. The irony is that Nigel will tell us happily how proud he is of Dominic.' </p> <p>Lawson p\u00e8re was once editor of the Spectator too, but his son appeared to set a driven agenda during his tenure in the same job. An interview with Nicholas Ridley, in which Ridley disclosed his view of Germans, led to the Minister's resignation. Disclosure of Lord Denning's view of the Guildford Four and the Birmingham Six - 'easier if they had been hung' - led to humiliation for the former Master of the Rolls. 'These people were hardly innocents abroad,' points out a Lawson admirer, 'but Dominic drew blood.' </p> <p>Since his appointment to the Sunday Telegraph in 1995, Lawson has shown a firm touch. He has written successfully - although not exploitatively - about the birth of his daughter Domenica, who has Down's Syndrome. But a story count for the last 12 months yields 15 times as many hits for 'prostitution' and 'cocaine' as for 'common agricultural policy', efforts at popularisation which have driven up sales. 'To Dominic, it's all showbusiness,' says a loyal staffer. 'He wants to get his paper right. I'm a great believer that he has tabloid instincts.' If the editorship on a broadsheet does not become vacant in the next five years, perhaps it will be the Daily Mail - or a Daily Express owned by the Telegraph - to which Lawson brings his tabloid skills.

One important finding of that investigation is that minimally-trained 'technicians' were openly filmed falsifying data for HLS' customers. That HLS knowingly allowed human health to be endangered proves that not only were the animals' deaths worthless, the results may have distorted the true toxicity of the substance involved.

Immediately, Davie went to work, cooking up the drug on a spoon over the flame of lighter. Holding the syringe in one trembling hand, he injected into a vein in the other. And the trembling stopped.</p> <p>We were not sitting in Glasgow, Liverpool or London, and Davie is no deprived no-hope youngster from a sink council estate.

Home to the second-largest fishing fleet in Britain, the harbour is filled with modern trawlers worth up to \u00a3200,000 each. Even in these trying days of falling stocks and EU quotas, the men who crew these boats can bring in \u00a330,000 a year, the owners and skippers even more. Look closely around Fraserburgh and the trappings of high income are there: the BMWs and Audis, the gaudy, modern bungalows on the outskirts of town.</p> <p>'We are in the middle of a bloody disaster,' said Sandy Wisley, a local doctor. 'If this was Glasgow or London, there would be a public outcry, but because we're a tiny place stuck away up here in the top corner, nobody is interested.'</p> <p>The cold statistics compiled by Wisley at his Finlayson Street surgery are staggering. One in five young men in his practice, which covers 13,000 of the town's population, is a drug addict. About 70 per cent work on the trawlers, or did until they could no longer juggle their habits and their jobs. Wisley is treating more than 230 addicts and claims that two new ones come to him every week. Between February and April 1998, the practice prescribed 3,622 tablets of the opiate substitute dihydrocodeine; in the same period last year, more than 83,000 tablets - known as 'diffs' by users - were prescribed. The current tally is running above 90,000.</p> <p>In total, there are about 450 heroin users in the town, more than 2 per cent of the population. On average, they consume about \u00a380 of heroin each a day, more than \u00a329,000 a year. Spread over the whole population, from infants to pensioners, that means heroin is costing every single person in Fraserburgh about \u00a3800 each a year. Dealers can make \u00a35,000 a week here, but not all of this is profit; a substantial percentage of their income is used by the dealers to feed their own habits. 'It would be a great living if I didn't have to shoot so much up my arm,' said Davie's dealer.</p> <p>Heroin has taken a heavy toll on Fraserburgh's young population. On 30 December the town achieved the dubious distinction of being home to Scotland's last drugs fatality of 2000. Richard Smith, 24, had been a familiar face in the local drugs scene for years, but on the Saturday before New Year the heroin addict was found dead at a house in the village of St Combs, just outside Fraserburgh. His death was the 140th in the area since 1996, when the scale of the drugs problem began to emerge.</p> <p>'We first spotted the drugs problem in the early 1990s, but in 1997 it just exploded.' Wisley explains. 'Now, if I walk down the high street and 20 young lads say hello to me, you can bet that 15 of them will be addicts. And the only reason is money. These kids come back off the boats with a few thousand pounds a month in their pockets, and they don't know what else to do with it. In the past it would have been fast cars and drink binges, now it is drugs.'</p> <p>That is exactly how it was with Davie. He has not reached the stage where he has had to sell off the television, the hi-fi or the PlayStation, but his flat was in chaos, smelling of unwashed clothes and fish.</p> <p>'You come back after 10 days or whatever at sea and you are ready to party,' he says. 'You've got money in your pocket and a bit of time on your hands, so you go a bit wild.

'Kids don't really need to steal around here to finance their habits,' says Davie. 'Most of them make enough on their own, and when they can't earn any more they can con the money from their families.'</p> <p>But drugs agencies and police are becoming increasingly concerned about the quantity of crack cocaine making its way into the lucrative Fraserburgh drugs market.</p> <p>More and more addicts are testing positive for it. Doctors like Wisley are treating people whose heart rates are up at 190 beats a minute after crack binges, and some appear to be using the drug in combination with heroin in an attempt to increase the intensity of the fix.</p> <p>There have even been crack cocaine 'parties' in some of the outlying villages. 'Cocaine used to be practically non-existent around here,' said Wisley.

      "body": "<p>As with so many political downfalls, it was as much Peter Mandelson's duplicity in response to questions as his original offence that precipitated his resignation. Yet as we report today, in the follow-up to our original expos\u00e9 last weekend of the Mandelson affair, it is already becoming clear that the relationship between the Government and the Hinduja brothers was deeper and much more complicated than just the issue of a successful application for a passport.</p> <p>The degree to which the relationship with the brothers extends to the Minister for Europe, Keith Vaz, is also still worryingly unclear. The Government's response - on the face of it speedy and legitimate - has been to set up a judicial review. However, the unacceptable consequence of that decision has been to put the control and timing of the release of more information firmly within the Government's control. This is simply inadmissible given the scale of public interest in this matter. It is also poor politics.</p> <p>Interest in this affair is no longer driven by sensationalist fascination with the controversial figure of Mr Mandelson, whose judgment and suitability for high office were so obviously wanting. The passports-for-favours affair also goes to the heart of a central issue in British politics, namely where the private domain ends and the public domain begins. We live in a culture where politicians have never been less confident about asserting public purpose and the public interest. As they court the private sector, the boundaries between the public good and private interest become blurred and confused. In this territory of mutual favours, the scope for compromise and embarrassment is vast.</p> <p>If the Dome had been publicly financed and the absurd promise not made that it would not cost a penny of taxpayers' funds, the Government would not have had to abase itself to people like the Hinduja brothers in order to raise sponsorship funds in the first place. The story is repeated many times over - the new Wembley Stadium; the funding of the London Underground; the concessions to inward international investors on taxation and planning. Even by resisting the public funding of political parties, both Conservatives and Labour open themselves up to the charge of offering private favours to the moneyed and powerful.</p> <p>Every Minister will have learned an important lesson from Mr Mandelson's fate, but the Government should learn a larger lesson. There is a proper place for private partnership and private capital in public affairs, but only within parameters firmly established by those whose job it is to define the public interest.</p>",

Yet as we report today, in the follow-up to our original expos\u00e9 last weekend of the Mandelson affair, it is already becoming clear that the relationship between the Government and the Hinduja brothers was deeper and much more complicated than just the issue of a successful application for a passport. The degree to which the relationship with the brothers extends to the Minister for Europe, Keith Vaz, is also still worryingly unclear. The Government's response - on the face of it speedy and legitimate - has been to set up a judicial review. However, the unacceptable consequence of that decision has been to put the control and timing of the release of more information firmly within the Government's control. This is simply inadmissible given the scale of public interest in this matter. It is also poor politics. Interest in this affair is no longer driven by sensationalist fascination with the controversial figure of Mr Mandelson, whose judgment and suitability for high office were so obviously wanting. The passports-for-favours affair also goes to the heart of a central issue in British politics, namely where the private domain ends and the public domain begins. We live in a culture where politicians have never been less confident about asserting public purpose and the public interest. As they court the private sector, the boundaries between the public good and private interest become blurred and confused. In this territory of mutual favours, the scope for compromise and embarrassment is vast. If the Dome had been publicly financed and the absurd promise not made that it would not cost a penny of taxpayers' funds, the Government would not have had to abase itself to people like the Hinduja brothers in order to raise sponsorship funds in the first place. The story is repeated many times over - the new Wembley Stadium; the funding of the London Underground; the concessions to inward international investors on taxation and planning. Even by resisting the public funding of political parties, both Conservatives and Labour open themselves up to the charge of offering private favours to the moneyed and powerful. Every Minister will have learned an important lesson from Mr Mandelson's fate, but the Government should learn a larger lesson. There is a proper place for private partnership and private capital in public affairs, but only within parameters firmly established by those whose job it is to define the public interest.",

      "body": "<p>By an irony which escaped both men in the emotional fraughtness of the encounter, Tony Blair reached for a phrase minted by Margaret Thatcher to explain to Peter Mandelson why his political career was dead and Alastair Campbell was preparing the burial plot in history's cemetery for ruined talent. As they argued in the Prime Minister's study on Wednesday morning, and an impassioned argument there was, Blair told this oldest and most intimate of political allies and friends that there was 'no alternative' but for him to resign.</p> <p>The offence - in the eyes of the Prime Minister as well as an infuriated Campbell - was not that of misleading The Observer when our reporters questioned his office last weekend about the Hinduja brothers and passports. Nor was the crime that of putting Chris Smith in the position of misleading the Commons, though the Prime Minister regarded this as serious. No, as the Prime Minister saw it, the real outrage against the codes of New Labour was to breach the trust with him and his press secretary by not telling them the story straight.</p> <p>Some of the media coverage, portraying Mandelson in terms normally reserved for serial killers, suggested that he was guilty of the most outrageous mendacity ever committed in the annals of politics. Well, we could take every utterance emitted by Blair, Campbell and Gordon Brown over the past few years, or William Hague and his frontbenchers, or even some journalists, and I doubt they would all get a pristine pass through a lie detector.</p> <p>Whatever he had done, Mandelson's offence did not compare with Jonathan Aitken's, a man who tried to get his daughter to lie on oath for him. Like the mob, New Labour likes to keep - or at least tries to keep - its secrets, scandals and strategems in the family. Among the many nicknames Blair has given him over the years, he would refer to Mandelson as his consigli\u00e8re. The capital crime was to deceive the Godfather and his Enforcer, Campbell. And by doing so, Mandelson jeopardised the Firm at the most unforgivable of moments, the run-in to an election in which the Tories' only hope is to blacken all government as sleazy. That, ultimately, is why Mandelson had to sleep with the fishes.</p> <p>He had also transgressed other commandments that he had been so instrumental and successful in ramming into Labour during the transformation from years of unelectability into party of power. He had been indisciplined. The Hinduja affair fitted a pattern of behaviour of treating the rules as if they applied to everyone except himself and being notably casual about the proprieties to be followed when dealing with the rich.</p> <p>Not for the first time, just as the Government was trying to get its serious arguments and solid achievements across to the voters, a Mandelsonian scandal was screaming out of every media orifice. He had handed ammunition of an especially lethal nature to the tabloids which he, along with Alastair Campbell, had tutored the Prime Minister to treat with a mixture of loathing, supineness and fear. It has long been a regular source of despair to Tony Blair that his dervish of spin, so brilliant at giving counsel, was hopeless at taking advice about the hazards of his own whirling behaviour.</p> <p>A smarter operator would have been more assiduous about making friends and less careless about leaving his prints on the bodies of his many enemies. I'm told, for instance, that Gordon Brown is averse to putting anything sensitive or potentially inflammatory on official paper, a habit which causes some consternation at Number 10 and the Cabinet Office when important documents arrive from the Treasury without the signature of the Chancellor.</p> <p>Whether it was vanity, naivety or infatuation with riches - elements of all three, I guess, played their part - Mandelson demonstrated a startling penchant for living dangerously, especially when dealing with wealthy men of, ahem, interesting provenance. A smarter operator would have handled the Indian billionaires with asbestos gloves. To their requests for help, the cunning player would have bumped into the Immigration Minister in the Lobby to drop an unrecorded murmur in his ear while courteously and formally pointing the Hindujas in the direction of their constituency MP.</p> <p>To place another paradox on top of this teetering tower of ironies, the man so often and so erroneously described as a modern Machiavelli was not political enough. The final and most heinous of offences against the internal laws of this government was to imperil its grip on power. During that conversation with the Prime Minister, the Conservatives were already up and baying with the highly damaging line that nothing Labour said or pledged during the election could be trusted so long as Peter Mandelson was at Tony Blair's shoulder.</p> <p>Choosing between the man who had done so much to win that massive majority on May Day 1997 and taking any risks with the goal of securing the second term was, in the end, never much of a choice for Tony Blair. The second term came first. The folly of Peter Mandelson was to make himself so vulnerable to the forces he helped to conjure into British politics that he was finished off by the Prime Minister he had done so much to create.</p> <p>Not without a fight, mind you. It should be recorded that Mandelson hotly argued there was an alternative to his resignation. He pleaded with Blair for a reprieve. He complained that there had been a rush to judgment before the full facts were established and all the relevant officials had been interviewed. He fought with Blair to stay in the Cabinet, at least until after the completion of the inquiry into the Hinduja affair. Mandelson's sympathisers - there are still a few - contend that when the full facts are established, the picture may look more complicated and different.</p> <p>In the immediate aftermath of his first expulsion from the Cabinet, he was so depressed that some of his closest friends feared that Mandelson might even take his own life. This time, he is wretched, but he is also angry. Furious enough, perhaps, to try and challenge that universal assumption that he is finished. His decision to carry on as an MP, the voters of Hartlepool permitting, caused widespread surprise. It also so alarmed the Government that Geoff Hoon and Stephen Byers were sent out to consign him to a future as a deliverer of leaflets and knocker on doors. The Grand Vizier of New Labour, who might once have broken the careers of Messrs Byers and Hoon with a jagged whisper, is now himself airbrushed into oblivion by the junior cadre of modernisers. Politics is an unforgiving jungle.</p> <p>Yet no one who knows Peter Mandelson imagines him spending the next 20 years as an obscure backbencher, content to grapple with no greater challenge than helping council tenants to get their drains unblocked. Mandelson has said to friends: 'It hasn't ended yet.'</p> <p>This is certainly true in the sense that the emotional and political fall-out will continue to rain down for some time, hardest of all on the head of Tony Blair. Another of his sobriquets for Mandelson was 'my alter ego '. In his study on Wednesday, Tony Blair was amputating part of himself and without the benefit of much anaesthetic. High fury was accompanied by a sense of deep loss. Indeed, the depth of the loss sharpened the height of the fury. When they sat on the front bench that afternoon, the Prime Minister looked more pale and pink-eyed than his fallen friend. It is easy to believe those of the Prime Minister's allies who describe Tony Blair as 'devastated' and 'gutted'.</p> <p>The Prime Minister will be a lonelier man in his own government. He was the only profound mourner around the table at Thursday's first Mandelson-free Cabinet. That tells him how thoroughly his old friend's intrigues had alienated so many colleagues. I doubt there are many brave enough to say it to his face, but the unrestrained delight of so many in the Labour Party is not just because they loathed Peter Mandelson, but also because they were disturbed and bewildered that Mr Blair seemed so over-addicted to his alter ego.</p> <p>The decision to bring him back after the first disgrace casts an inevitable taint on the Prime Minister's judgment of character. And yet, in crucial respects which explain exactly why he did take the risk of bringing him back, Blair was absolutely right about Mandelson. The gloating thrill that has run up the collective spine of the Conservative Party, and was given rather graceless voice by William Hague, is informed by a relish that the fall of Mandelson weakens and destabilises the Prime Minister. It also springs from the - of course, unspoken - belief among Tories that this is the destruction of a formidable opponent.</p> <p>Also removed is one of the very few people who actually believed in the modernising programme in its entirety. Peter Mandelson was a Blairite before Blair. He was one of that tiny band who signed up to New Labour from more than ambition, sycophancy or convenience. He was the only big player in the Government apart from Tony Blair who could be called New Labour from absolute conviction. John Prescott, that great scorner of what he derides as nouveau Labour, can't have grinned so much since his honeymoon.</p> <p>Jack Straw and David Blunkett are, in their guts, traditional Labourish men wearing a modernising gloss. Gordon Brown is not really New Labour, a phrase he never uses these days. The Chancellor embraced the concept as a useful marketing tool with which to distance Labour from the failures of its past. What he never bought into - in the way Tony Blair did - was the Project as meaning an entirely different approach to progressive politics with the ambition of healing the breach between social democrats and liberals which gave so much of the twentieth century to the Conservatives.</p> <p>The cause of electoral reform within the Labour Party, already sinking, has been further holed. Of its remaining advocates at the level of Cabinet, Mo Mowlam is parked in the departure lounge and Robin Cook, though he will be encouraged by the removal of one predator for his job, will not feel strong enough to become an agitator for reform. One day, when the Tories are again a serious threat, the Labour Party will wake up. By that time, it will almost certainly be too late.</p> <p>The Cabinet has also lost its most consistent and articulate pro-European. Though commonly despised as an opportunist without two principles to rub together, Peter Mandelson burnt with the conviction that Britain's manifest destiny lies at the heart of Europe. That animated much of the glee with which his self-ignition was greeted by the Euro-hating press.</p> <p>Gordon Brown's much more agnostic, verging on the sceptical, approach towards early entry to the single currency is more likely to prevail now that the Prime Minister has been deprived of an intimate with clout who was prepared to push the opposing case and stiffen the Blair backbone in confrontations with his tungsten Chancellor. One of the explanations for Blair's dependency on Mandelson was that he prized him as a large personality, one of the few strong enough to help counterbalance Gordon Brown. The smashing of the original New Labour love triangle simplifies the relationship between the neighbours of Downing Street. No longer will Gordon Brown's paranoid streak be inflamed by the thought that when his early morning phone call to Tony is over, the next person on the line to the Prime Minister will be his hated rival for the ear of Blair.</p> <p>To Mandelson - and often, though not always, rightly - the Brownites attributed the inspiration for every disobliging reference to the Chancellor in the media. After one burst of infighting between the pair early last year, Mandelson told one friend that he should put a notice up on his desk: 'Remember: Gordon is mad.' Much as Tony Blair frequently bemoaned their incessant feuding, much as he pleaded with both men to bury the hatchet, at some deeply subconscious level it seems to have served him. Peter Mandelson's own theory was that Brown's hatred of him was a displacement of his ferocious resentment at Blair for snatching the crown of leadership which the Chancellor believes should have been his. Though evidently a self-serving bit of psychoanalysis, which conveniently neglected his own tendency to aggravate things, this has the ring of some truth.</p> <p>The removal of the third person in their marriage simplifies the Blair-Brown relationship: for better, so long as it remains relatively calm, perhaps for worse, when their eruptions can no longer be blamed on someone else. Gordon Brown would not be the acute strategist he is if he did not use his now untrammelled command over the election campaign to mark his claim to become Prime Minister. The Chancellor will want his stewardship of the economy and his campaign to receive the lion's credit for securing the second term. Those who try to protect Tony Blair's interests will be anxious that the Prime Minister's contribution is not entirely neglected.</p> <p>Brownite joy is unconfined not simply because their hate object has been immolated. In the complex balance of power between them, the seesaw has tilted to the Chancellor at the expense of the Prime Minister. As he drains the toxic dregs of the cocktail of ironies that finished him, perhaps it will be this bitter taste that lingers longest on the tongue of Peter Mandelson. Sacked by his old friend Tony Blair, his fall strengthens no one more than his ancient enemy, Gordon Brown.</p> <p>\u0095 Andrew Rawnsley's dissection of the the first three years of New Labour, Servants of the People, is published by Hamish Hamilton at \u00a317.99</p>",

I'm told, for instance, that Gordon Brown is averse to putting anything sensitive or potentially inflammatory on official paper, a habit which causes some consternation at Number 10 and the Cabinet Office when important documents arrive from the Treasury without the signature of the Chancellor. Whether it was vanity, naivety or infatuation with riches - elements of all three, I guess, played their part - Mandelson demonstrated a startling penchant for living dangerously, especially when dealing with wealthy men of, ahem, interesting provenance. A smarter operator would have handled the Indian billionaires with asbestos gloves. To their requests for help, the cunning player would have bumped into the Immigration Minister in the Lobby to drop an unrecorded murmur in his ear while courteously and formally pointing the Hindujas in the direction of their constituency MP. To place another paradox on top of this teetering tower of ironies, the man so often and so erroneously described as a modern Machiavelli was not political enough. The final and most heinous of offences against the internal laws of this government was to imperil its grip on power. During that conversation with the Prime Minister, the Conservatives were already up and baying with the highly damaging line that nothing Labour said or pledged during the election could be trusted so long as Peter Mandelson was at Tony Blair's shoulder. Choosing between the man who had done so much to win that massive majority on May Day 1997 and taking any risks with the goal of securing the second term was, in the end, never much of a choice for Tony Blair. The second term came first. The folly of Peter Mandelson was to make himself so vulnerable to the forces he helped to conjure into British politics that he was finished off by the Prime Minister he had done so much to create. Not without a fight, mind you. It should be recorded that Mandelson hotly argued there was an alternative to his resignation. He pleaded with Blair for a reprieve. He complained that there had been a rush to judgment before the full facts were established and all the relevant officials had been interviewed. He fought with Blair to stay in the Cabinet, at least until after the completion of the inquiry into the Hinduja affair. Mandelson's sympathisers - there are still a few - contend that when the full facts are established, the picture may look more complicated and different. In the immediate aftermath of his first expulsion from the Cabinet, he was so depressed that some of his closest friends feared that Mandelson might even take his own life. This time, he is wretched, but he is also angry. Furious enough, perhaps, to try and challenge that universal assumption that he is finished. His decision to carry on as an MP, the voters of Hartlepool permitting, caused widespread surprise. It also so alarmed the Government that Geoff Hoon and Stephen Byers were sent out to consign him to a future as a deliverer of leaflets and knocker on doors. The Grand Vizier of New Labour, who might once have broken the careers of Messrs Byers and Hoon with a jagged whisper, is now himself airbrushed into oblivion by the junior cadre of modernisers. Politics is an unforgiving jungle. Yet no one who knows Peter Mandelson imagines him spending the next 20 years as an obscure backbencher, content to grapple with no greater challenge than helping council tenants to get their drains unblocked. Mandelson has said to friends: 'It hasn't ended yet.' This is certainly true in the sense that the emotional and political fall-out will continue to rain down for some time, hardest of all on the head of Tony Blair. Another of his sobriquets for Mandelson was 'my alter ego '. In his study on Wednesday, Tony Blair was amputating part of himself and without the benefit of much anaesthetic. High fury was accompanied by a sense of deep loss. Indeed, the depth of the loss sharpened the height of the fury. When they sat on the front bench that afternoon, the Prime Minister looked more pale and pink-eyed than his fallen friend. It is easy to believe those of the Prime Minister's allies who describe Tony Blair as 'devastated' and 'gutted'. The Prime Minister will be a lonelier man in his own government. He was the only profound mourner around the table at Thursday's first Mandelson-free Cabinet. That tells him how thoroughly his old friend's intrigues had alienated so many colleagues. I doubt there are many brave enough to say it to his face, but the unrestrained delight of so many in the Labour Party is not just because they loathed Peter Mandelson, but also because they were disturbed and bewildered that Mr Blair seemed so over-addicted to his alter ego. The decision to bring him back after the first disgrace casts an inevitable taint on the Prime Minister's judgment of character. And yet, in crucial respects which explain exactly why he did take the risk of bringing him back, Blair was absolutely right about Mandelson. The gloating thrill that has run up the collective spine of the Conservative Party, and was given rather graceless voice by William Hague, is informed by a relish that the fall of Mandelson weakens and destabilises the Prime Minister. It also springs from the - of course, unspoken - belief among Tories that this is the destruction of a formidable opponent. Also removed is one of the very few people who actually believed in the modernising programme in its entirety. Peter Mandelson was a Blairite before Blair. He was one of that tiny band who signed up to New Labour from more than ambition, sycophancy or convenience. He was the only big player in the Government apart from Tony Blair who could be called New Labour from absolute conviction. John Prescott, that great scorner of what he derides as nouveau Labour, can't have grinned so much since his honeymoon. Jack Straw and David Blunkett are, in their guts, traditional Labourish men wearing a modernising gloss. Gordon Brown is not really New Labour, a phrase he never uses these days. The Chancellor embraced the concept as a useful marketing tool with which to distance Labour from the failures of its past. What he never bought into - in the way Tony Blair did - was the Project as meaning an entirely different approach to progressive politics with the ambition of healing the breach between social democrats and liberals which gave so much of the twentieth century to the Conservatives. The cause of electoral reform within the Labour Party, already sinking, has been further holed. Of its remaining advocates at the level of Cabinet, Mo Mowlam is parked in the departure lounge and Robin Cook, though he will be encouraged by the removal of one predator for his job, will not feel strong enough to become an agitator for reform. One day, when the Tories are again a serious threat, the Labour Party will wake up. By that time, it will almost certainly be too late. The Cabinet has also lost its most consistent and articulate pro-European. Though commonly despised as an opportunist without two principles to rub together, Peter Mandelson burnt with the conviction that Britain's manifest destiny lies at the heart of Europe. That animated much of the glee with which his self-ignition was greeted by the Euro-hating press. Gordon Brown's much more agnostic, verging on the sceptical, approach towards early entry to the single currency is more likely to prevail now that the Prime Minister has been deprived of an intimate with clout who was prepared to push the opposing case and stiffen the Blair backbone in confrontations with his tungsten Chancellor. One of the explanations for Blair's dependency on Mandelson was that he prized him as a large personality, one of the few strong enough to help counterbalance Gordon Brown. The smashing of the original New Labour love triangle simplifies the relationship between the neighbours of Downing Street. No longer will Gordon Brown's paranoid streak be inflamed by the thought that when his early morning phone call to Tony is over, the next person on the line to the Prime Minister will be his hated rival for the ear of Blair. To Mandelson - and often, though not always, rightly - the Brownites attributed the inspiration for every disobliging reference to the Chancellor in the media. After one burst of infighting between the pair early last year, Mandelson told one friend that he should put a notice up on his desk: 'Remember: Gordon is mad.' Much as Tony Blair frequently bemoaned their incessant feuding, much as he pleaded with both men to bury the hatchet, at some deeply subconscious level it seems to have served him. Peter Mandelson's own theory was that Brown's hatred of him was a displacement of his ferocious resentment at Blair for snatching the crown of leadership which the Chancellor believes should have been his. Though evidently a self-serving bit of psychoanalysis, which conveniently neglected his own tendency to aggravate things, this has the ring of some truth. The removal of the third person in their marriage simplifies the Blair-Brown relationship: for better, so long as it remains relatively calm, perhaps for worse, when their eruptions can no longer be blamed on someone else. Gordon Brown would not be the acute strategist he is if he did not use his now untrammelled command over the election campaign to mark his claim to become Prime Minister. The Chancellor will want his stewardship of the economy and his campaign to receive the lion's credit for securing the second term. Those who try to protect Tony Blair's interests will be anxious that the Prime Minister's contribution is not entirely neglected. Brownite joy is unconfined not simply because their hate object has been immolated. In the complex balance of power between them, the seesaw has tilted to the Chancellor at the expense of the Prime Minister. As he drains the toxic dregs of the cocktail of ironies that finished him, perhaps it will be this bitter taste that lingers longest on the tongue of Peter Mandelson. Sacked by his old friend Tony Blair, his fall strengthens no one more than his ancient enemy, Gordon Brown. \u0095 Andrew Rawnsley's dissection of the the first three years of New Labour, Servants of the People, is published by Hamish Hamilton at \u00a317.99",

      "body": "<p>The year is 2010. In the first decade of the twenty-first century the face of the global economy has been transformed by the internet. This is tomorrow's business, e-business, and it is dominated by a relatively small number of successful service economies, themselves centred on hub or 'smart' cities, such as Singapore or Dubai. They sit astride the vital infrastructure of the communications network in much the same way that ports, such as Venice, once dominated the trade of the Mediterranean. </p> <p>It is with such predictions in mind that the Government has set itself the task of making Britain an information superpower or, in the words of Tony Blair, 'the best place in the world for e-business'. Is this ambitious policy initiative realistic? </p> <p>As a nation, we may love to be disappointed but according to a survey of European executives, Britain is viewed as the preferred location to start an internet-related business, with Germany and France in second and third places respectively. A third of European business managers perceive the UK as the leading European information economy, followed closely again by Germany. </p> <p>Professor Jim Norton, head of e-business at the Institute of Directors and author of government e-commerce policy, would argue that the UK is already the world leader in businesses trading online. However, he advises that the criteria supporting this claim should be viewed with caution for two reasons. First, the definition of trading online is too broad.

      "bodyText": "The year is 2010. In the first decade of the twenty-first century the face of the global economy has been transformed by the internet. This is tomorrow's business, e-business, and it is dominated by a relatively small number of successful service economies, themselves centred on hub or 'smart' cities, such as Singapore or Dubai. They sit astride the vital infrastructure of the communications network in much the same way that ports, such as Venice, once dominated the trade of the Mediterranean. It is with such predictions in mind that the Government has set itself the task of making Britain an information superpower or, in the words of Tony Blair, 'the best place in the world for e-business'. Is this ambitious policy initiative realistic? As a nation, we may love to be disappointed but according to a survey of European executives, Britain is viewed as the preferred location to start an internet-related business, with Germany and France in second and third places respectively. A third of European business managers perceive the UK as the leading European information economy, followed closely again by Germany. Professor Jim Norton, head of e-business at the Institute of Directors and author of government e-commerce policy, would argue that the UK is already the world leader in businesses trading online. However, he advises that the criteria supporting this claim should be viewed with caution for two reasons. First, the definition of trading online is too broad. Second, the quoted percentages of businesses are weighted by employment, so larger companies dominate. 'Where we need to do better in the UK is for many businesses to overcome their instinctive aversion to new technology, looking beyond to the potential impact on their business models. 'This is not a \"new economy\"; it is a new set of tools and freedoms, which are complementary and can be usefully deployed in almost any \"Old Economy\" company.

      "body": "<p>America 2001. While the inflated riches of the new economy are wilting, an older power is stalking the land. As George W. Bush arrives in Washington from Texas he brings with him a coterie of friends from the Lone Star state whose fortunes, in common with his own, have been founded on power - oil, gas, and electricity. </p> <p>The timing could hardly be more symbolic. Twenty-first century California is plunged into spasms of nineteenth-century darkness because its power system cannot cope with the demands of its internet-fuelled economy. Meanwhile, energy companies are making fortunes as they sell electricity at vastly inflated prices - up to $1,000 a megawatt-hour compared with a $30 norm - into the starved Californian grid. These are swell times for Bush's new oiligocracy. </p> <p>But there is more. Electricity deregulation, the problem at the heart of the farce in California, promises to be one of the most controversial legislative issues of Bush's term in office. </p> <p>With a finely balanced Congress, the California humiliation, and a summer of massive energy price volatility in midwest states, there is waning support for further deregulation. </p> <p>But Bush and his energy industry players want deregulation. They would do. Two California utilities, Southern California Edison (SCE) and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, may be facing financial ruin because they can't get consumers to pay the price they are having to shell out for wholesale power. But companies supplying power, be they utilities operating Californian power plants they bought under deregulation or energy traders, are cashing in. </p> <p>This is happening not only in the Golden State, but right across the US - half of which is deregulated - where fortunes can be made from the mismatch between supply and demand. </p> <p>Some of these big players will be familiar in the UK. Utilities owning California plants include Southern Energy, part of a consortium buying Welsh utility Hyder, AES Corp, which owns the massive Drax power station in Yorkshire, trader Dynegy, Reliant, which held merger talks with PowerGen, and TXU, owner of Eastern Electricity and a pan-European trader. Enron, which trades in California, operates two plants in Britain and trades here. The last four are all Texan. </p> <p>Reliant, Dynegy, and AES have been branded by California governor Gray Davis as 'pirates and plunderers'. The companies and their shareholders won't care. Last week Enron announced a huge increase in revenues at the end of the fourth quarter, driven by soaring wholesale operations. It refused to split out Californian earnings. Dynegy's fourth quarter saw earnings double to $105.9m. </p> <p>These companies want further deregulation wherever in the world they operate. In the US they want to negotiate on a state-by-state basis rather than have onerous environmental and consumer protection conditions imposed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). </p> <p>They will take their message to the heart of the White House.Texas energy companies, including Enron, TXU, Dynegy and Reliant, have long exerted influence with the Bush dynasty. Diane Albaugh, wife of Bush's campaign manager, registered last autumn to lobby on behalf of TXU, Reliant, and Entergy, another Texas-based utility. </p> <p>The heads of two Texas energy players - Enron's Kenneth Lay and TXU's Earl Nye - are on the energy team of Bush's transitional administration, and both have made hefty donations to Bush: Lay $310,000 in the past two years and Nye $50,000, according to the Washington-based Center for Responsive Politics. </p> <p>Lay is particularly close to Bush, having served his father and acted as a fundraiser. Since 1999, Enron, which is also an oil and gas operator with an interest in deregulation, has bankrolled George W's election campaign to the tune of $555,275 - his highest single donor. </p> <p>Both Lay and Nye are arguing that what has happened in California should not taint future plans, despite the fact that deregulation in midwest states such as Illinois and Ohio caused massive price volatility last summer. </p> <p>Deregulation supporters argue that California is a one-off, caused partly by environmental blocks to new power stations. Only 700mwh have been built since 1995, compared with 5,700mwh in Bush's Texas. Lay even argues that instead of a federal cap being imposed on wholesale prices, Californian consumers should reduce their electricity consumption. </p> <p>This desire from the energy giants for deregulation and minimal federal interference was clear from the four-year campaign in Congress run by industry and the Republicans. In 1996 the FERC ordered utilities to open their electricity lines to competitors. Further deregulation has divided Congress, and in the run-up to the 2000 election the main concern was the role of FERC. </p> <p>Two Congressmen spearheaded the move for state-by-state control: Joe Barton, chairman of the House energy and power subcommittee and a Texas Republican with close links to Bush; and Alaskan senator Frank Murkowski, head of the Senate energy and natural resources committee. According to CRP, of the total $793,064 contributions to Bush's election funds, a massive $256,940 was paid by energy companies. </p> <p>This included $12,750 from TXU, $10,000 from Reliant, $7,591 from industry lobby group Edison Electric Institute, $5,000 from Ohio utility Cinergy, and $3,000 from Enron. Energy analyst Jerry Oppenheim says it is clear what the companies were paying for: 'Deregulation created volatility, which is what energy traders want. Doing it state by state increases the ability to lobby individual states for favourable deregulation.' </p> <p>With Bush in the White House, the energy giants are pushing at an open door. In 1997 Bush pushed for a bill that would have deregulated the industry without offering safeguards to consumers or the environment. This 'Bush Bill' failed. In 1999, the Texas legislature passed a deregulation bill, again backed by Bush, this time with some protections in place. </p> <p>Janee Briesemeister of the South-west region of the US Consumers Union says: 'Bush will argue that California is unique. That's what the energy people want, and access to Bush's team gives them great influence. But there are no consumers' representatives on it, and the 1997 bill shows where his concerns lie.' The question now is, will Republicans be able to drive the plans through a divided Congress? </p> <p>Some of the lobbying by these US companies will effectively be supported by UK consumers through revenues contributed to parent companies. In the UK itself they could make a great deal of money from the next stage of electricity deregulation here: the introduction of new electricity trading arrangements, (NETA) which will replace the electricity pool. </p> <p>NETA is intended to make the energy market more competitive by matching supply and demand more accurately than the current pool does. Under the new arrangement, forward contracts between generators and suppliers will become important. For companies that have not contracted successfully and matched demands with their supply, there will be a short-term balancing market. </p> <p>The prices at this balancing stage, particularly in the first year of NETA, are expected to be very volatile. </p> <p>David Warwick of KWI, a risk management consultancy, says that while bankrupt utilities and power cuts may not be a feature of NETA, there will be problems that traders can exploit. </p> <p>'The problem is that many electricity suppliers have not bought forward contracts. They will have to rely a lot on the balancing market, which will become very volatile at times, and very expensive. I would expect some suppliers to see their profits hit. And the traders which get it right will make a lot of money.' </p> <p>The US companies that have spent so much time lobbying for American deregulation have done so here too, putting in detailed papers to the UK regulator. Four are, coincidentally, from the Lone Star state - Enron, TXU, Entergy and Dynegy. For them, if not for Bush, there will continue to be a special relationship with the UK.</p>",

      "body": "<p>In the modern world, temptation is a tricky business. In an era when the new religion is Instant Gratification, it seems that we are no sooner tempted than we succumb. Some of us even manage to succumb before we are tempted. Others might not even have a clear idea what temptation is, we're that busy succumbing. </p> <p>At the moment, I am being tempted by cigarettes, which I gave up at New Year in a blaze of glory, and never looked back. Sadly, the reason I never looked back is because I'm too busy looking at cigarette machines or other people smoking cigarettes. For me, where ciggies are concerned, temptation seems to be everywhere. Indeed, whatever your 'serpent' of choice - sex, money, drugs - temptation seems to be all around us, gushing away like a jammed tap. Which could explain why one sees so many Colditz Couples these days. Colditz Couples are where one partner (usually the man) is absolutely desperate to escape from the relationship, at least temporarily, while the other partner (invariably the woman) is equally desperate to stop them escaping. </p> <p>It's a sick dance of ennui and despair deeply ingrained in the human psyche. One person wants to have sex with someone else, while the other person wants to stop them having that sex, even though they don't particularly want to have sex with them themselves. Most of us have been one half of a Colditz Couple, an emotional POW. No matter which side you're on, it's always painful. And because it's a sex thing, and therefore a human thing, of all the temptations it's the most difficult to resist.

The rules seem simple enough: beautiful young couples wearing elegant smiles and beach gear made of dental floss (and that's just their formal look) arrive on Temptation Island, whereupon they are separated from their partners, taken to opposite ends of the island and thrown in among half-naked members of the opposite sex, thereby putting their relationship to the (fanfare of ratings trumpets) 'ultimate test!'

      "bodyText": "In the modern world, temptation is a tricky business. In an era when the new religion is Instant Gratification, it seems that we are no sooner tempted than we succumb. Some of us even manage to succumb before we are tempted. Others might not even have a clear idea what temptation is, we're that busy succumbing. At the moment, I am being tempted by cigarettes, which I gave up at New Year in a blaze of glory, and never looked back. Sadly, the reason I never looked back is because I'm too busy looking at cigarette machines or other people smoking cigarettes. For me, where ciggies are concerned, temptation seems to be everywhere. Indeed, whatever your 'serpent' of choice - sex, money, drugs - temptation seems to be all around us, gushing away like a jammed tap. Which could explain why one sees so many Colditz Couples these days. Colditz Couples are where one partner (usually the man) is absolutely desperate to escape from the relationship, at least temporarily, while the other partner (invariably the woman) is equally desperate to stop them escaping. It's a sick dance of ennui and despair deeply ingrained in the human psyche. One person wants to have sex with someone else, while the other person wants to stop them having that sex, even though they don't particularly want to have sex with them themselves. Most of us have been one half of a Colditz Couple, an emotional POW. No matter which side you're on, it's always painful. And because it's a sex thing, and therefore a human thing, of all the temptations it's the most difficult to resist. We've all heard about the devil tempting Jesus on the mountaintop with all the riches of the world, and how JC abstained. What is not so well known is that the devil then tempted Jesus with a photo of Mary Magdalene having a bubble bath, and Jesus was skidding down that mountaintop faster than you could say 'Son of God'.

This old city is a place of darkness, mourning and horror. </p> <p>A few people trapped under collapsed buildings were still alive as dawn broke - but there was no one to dig them out. No one was even trying. </p> <p>'We heard a girl's cries to begin with. But by afternoon they stopped. There is nothing we can do,' one officer shrugs. </p> <p>At least 13,000 and perhaps 15,000 people died, mostly in India and a few in Pakistan. Here at the heart of the horror most buildings are damaged or fissured. Hundreds of people lie in tombs beneath multi-storey blocks. There is no electricity or water and power lines have been wiped out. </p> <p>The town's two main hospitals are rubble. The streets are littered with the dead, laid out in neat lines, their faces covered with saris or towels. Groups of relatives pushed carts to cremation grounds carrying corpses. The authorities seem paralysed and clueless. </p> <p>Pravina Abla had been at work when the earthquake struck. She had left her eight-year-old daughter Kushbu at home. And so, when after three deadly minutes the tremors finally subsided, she raced through what was left of Bhuj's old city to try to find her. </p> <p>But where her house had stood, there was a 30ft pile of rubble. 'There is no rescue team here. No one has come to help me find my daughter,' she said. 'My little girl is under there. I can hear her crying, I can hear her crying. But no one comes.' </p> <p>In the corner of a municipal garden, Jubilee Grounds, a team of 40 doctors were last night treating patients in a makeshift tent on wooden beds. 'We have had 900 people here,' Dr Mahindra Goswamy said. 'We had one patient today with a fractured spine who was dug out after 24 hours, but no one else.' </p> <p>Outside, hundreds of patients lay on the ground with drips in their arms awaiting treatment. 'This is my worst day as a doctor,' Dr Goswamy added. </p> <p>Journeying to Bhuj, across one of India's most sparsely populated areas, the devastation is immediately apparent. The bridge which leads to Kutch, the district worst affected, is crumpled in several places. The fields are littered with dead sheep and goats, feasted on by vultures and kites. Everything has fallen over as if prodded: petrol pumps, toll booths and roadside shrines. Entire villages have been obliterated. In the village of Vondh not a single building was left standing. Those who were out herding their goats when the earthquake struck were busy burning their dead. </p> <p>The smoke from a dozen cremation fires billowed across the desert. In the opposite direction, streaming away from Bhuj, the homeless trudged to safety carrying on their heads sacks of rice and children. </p> <p>As well as killing thousands, the earthquake also swept away the local maharaja's 16th-century palace. 'I had taken a bath. I was inside when there was a tremor. Immediately I knew it was an earthquake,' the maharaja's cousin, Ghanshyam Singh, said. </p> <p>'I ran outside and stood under the door frame. I could hear the sound of the Burmese teak girders crashing above me. It is thanks to God that I survived,' he said. </p> <p>Singh said Bhuj was hit by three or more aftershocks yesterday and that everyone was too afraid to return to their homes. 'There is no relief operation. We haven't seen a single person here,' he added. </p> <p>The authorities last night denied accusations of incompetence. 'We have got cranes working in the main city as well as teams with metal-cutting equipment trying to free people from the rubble,' one senior army officersaid. </p> <p>The job had not started at all yesterday in the old city where dead buffalo, crushed motorbikes and the bodies of elderly women lay in the alleyways. Some 150 army personnel stationed at Bhuj are believed to have died instantly when the earthquake struck. Relief flights are arriving at Bhuj. By road, a trickle of aid has got through. Jeeps from Bombay with boxes of drugs are arriving. </p> <p>The earthquake also devastated Gujurat's main city, Ahmedabad. Rescuers were last night trying to dig out the bodies of 59 children at Swamy Narayan primary school. The children had come in for lessons on Friday - when the rest of India had a day off to celebrate Republic Day - for a science project. Then the school roof fell on top of them. 'My boy, my boy,' one father said in tears. More than 40 buildings in the city collapsed, killing around 500 people. </p> <p>Meanwhile, a military plane carrying a 69-strong team from the International Rescue Corps yesterday left for India, taking off from Brize Norton RAF base in Oxfordshire. </p> <p>Bharat Patel, speaking on behalf of the Bhuj temple in Woolwich, south-east London, said: 'We are concerned that the Government is hugely underestimating the number of British citizens that have been caught in this earthquake.

If the humiliation of having to resign his ministerial position wasn't a big enough blow to his ego, the savaging he took from the nation's press was enough to finish off any man. The Sun front-page comment on Thursday was as brutal as it was brief. In a withering condemnation, it described the shamed Northern Ireland Secretary as 'a lying, manipulative, oily, two-faced, nasty piece of work'. All they needed to really finish the job off was to add the words... 'and they're his good points'. As Mandelson steels himself for life as a backbencher, he'd do well to ignore the venom of the national tabloids. Instead he should listen to the people of Hartlepool. The good folk of his constituency have pulled no punches in their condemnation of his recent actions. Indeed, they've been firing warning shots across his bows for many weeks.

The Executive's statement promises only that it will bring forward 'proposals' and costings for free nursing and personal care by August, a move interpreted by opposition parties as a delaying tactic to buy time for Labour until after the UK general election. But Liddell, who became the first woman to hold the job of Scottish Secretary on Thursday after John Reid was moved to succeed Peter Mandelson, said she would not be putting pressure on McLeish and the Executive to toe the London line. 'I would not have campaigned for devolution for so many years if I didn't believe in the right of the Scottish Parliament to make its own decisions,' she said. Liddell's intervention is unlikely to ease the doubts of opposition politicians and groups representing the elderly, who have warned the Executive of a public outcry if promises of free care are watered down again. The row has severely strained relations between the two ruling parties at Holyrood. Jim Wallace, Deputy First Minister and leader of the Scottish Lib Dems, upped the ante on Friday when he released an open letter to his backbenchers promising unequivocally that free care would be delivered. Labour Ministers, by sharp contrast, refused to expand on the promise to bring forward proposals.",

It was a while before I got the hang of it. 'You must inhale,' she would insist, 'otherwise you won't enjoy the full benefits of the nicotine'. She had a point</p> <p>It comes as no surprise that scientists are now discovering that nicotine may not be so bad for you after all. According to a 1994 article in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine, smokers are less likely to get ulcerative colitis - inflammation of the bowels - than non-smokers. Indeed, the article claims, 'the onset of colitis is often associated with the cessation of smoking.' Recently, a Duke University Medical Center study found that nicotine helped Alzheimer's disease patients. Pharmaceutical companies are now trying to develop nicotine medication for use against schizophrenia and depression.</p> <p>I am not saying that a pack a day will do you as much good as a two-mile run. On the other hand, I don't take the health warnings particularly seriously either. The anti-smoking campaign, a noxious alliance of government and corporations, was always a giant scam to transfer wealth from the poor to the rich. It was not the shareholders of Philip Morris or R.J. Reynolds who were fleeced. They know how to look after themselves and have not gone poor. It was ordinary smokers, many of whom earned very little, who were forced to turn over an ever-larger share of their income to the state. Governments love sales taxes. They are not as readily noticeable as taxes on income. And their targets are usually the poor, who are unlikely to protest as vehemently as the rich.</p> <p>More sinister has been the role of the corporations. Anxious about the costs of providing their workforce with health care coverage, corporate managers launched a fierce campaign to compel their employees to lead healthy lives. It was not enough that they did not smoke at the workplace. They could not smoke outside the workplace either. They could not drink. And they had to maintain a proper diet. Ted Turner, the founder of CNN, for example, refused to hire smokers. A few years ago, the Florida Supreme Court ruled that it was not a violation of privacy for an employer to ask a job applicant whether or not he had smoked over the previous 12 months. A desire to reduce health insurance costs, the Court argued, constituted reasonable grounds for not hiring someone.</p> <p>The health care costs are ludicrously exaggerated. And deliberately so, for it provides the corporations with an excuse to intrude into their employees' personal lives. And it provides government with a basis to make a bogus financial claim. Smokers are not a net cost to society. The US academic W. Kip Viscusi argues that smokers will die before non-smokers. Therefore, whatever the health care they may inflict on others during their lifetimes, these would be more than offset by the financial gains that arise from lower nursing home costs, not to mention foregone retirement pensions and social security claims.</p> <p>The biggest financial burden today is not treatment of the sick but support of the elderly. In Britain the figures are quite startling. Within 30 years Britain is expected to be devoting around 5 per cent of its GNP to long-term care for the elderly - almost the resources the National Health Service as a whole currently commands. Eleven million people receive retirement benefits today, up from \u00a38 million in 1975. In 1999 Britain spent \u00a399 billion on social security benefits, doubling in real terms over 20 years.</p> <p>Nearly half of this expenditure was on the elderly who, in addition to retirement pensions, may be entitled to income support, housing and council tax benefits. They may also receive home care, day care and meal services. Moreover, if they are sick and disabled, they may be entitled to incapacity benefits, war pensions and statutory sick pay. And that does not even include the amount spent on their medical care. In 1990, there were 3.4 people of working age to every pensioner. By 2031, the ratio may change to 2.7 to one. According to one projection, by the year 2050, 75 per cent of the population will be looking for support from the remaining 25 per cent.</p> <p>Thus the State's financial claims on the tobacco industry are without foundation. In any case, are smokers really that much more unhealthy than non-smokers? Interestingly, it is hard to get an answer to that question.</p> <p>The American Center for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 400,000 people die every year from smoking-related diseases. How it arrives at this figure has always been a bit of a mystery. For one thing, what exactly is a smoking-related disease? According to the CDC it is something a smoker is more likely to get than a non-smoker. Thus if a smoker dies of heart disease, say, the CDC will count it as a smoking-related death. This means that other possible causes, such as a family history of heart disease or chronic lack of exercise, are resolutely ignored. Moreover, the CDC does not like to tell us at what age these 400,000 died. The suggestion is they died young. Yet there is no evidence of this.</p> <p>Everyone dies of something. Dying of lung cancer at 75 is not the same as dying of it at 45. As a Cato Institute study pointed out: 'Almost 255,000 of the smoking-related deaths - nearly 60 percent of the total - occurred at age 70 or above. More than 192,000 deaths - nearly 45 percent of the total - occurred at age 75 or higher. And roughly 72,000 deaths - almost 17 percent of the total - occurred at the age of 85 or above.'</p> <p>The CDC loves to cite meaningless statistics, such as: 'Men who smoke increase their risk of death from lung cancer by more than 22 times and from bronchitis and emphysema by nearly 10 times.' Well, it all rather depends on what the likelihood of non-smokers dying from lung cancer is. If the chances are very small, then 22 times this figure will still not amount to a huge number. 'On average,' the CDC claims, 'smokers die nearly seven years earlier than nonsmokers'. Seven years is by no means an insignificant number if true. On the other hand, it is a far cry from the doom-laden tales of the anti-smoking zealots. A 1991 RAND study claimed that smoking 'reduces the life expectancy of a 20-year-old by about 4.3 years'. I think I can stand to lose 4.3 years from my life. As Harry Lime explained in The Third Man : 'The dead are happier dead. They don't miss much here, poor devils.'</p>",

'On average,' the CDC claims, 'smokers die nearly seven years earlier than nonsmokers'. Seven years is by no means an insignificant number if true. On the other hand, it is a far cry from the doom-laden tales of the anti-smoking zealots. A 1991 RAND study claimed that smoking 'reduces the life expectancy of a 20-year-old by about 4.3 years'. I think I can stand to lose 4.3 years from my life. As Harry Lime explained in The Third Man : 'The dead are happier dead. They don't miss much here, poor devils.'",

'At six feet he's not the tallest of goalkeepers, but he gets up much higher than anyone else,' Coton said.

Alexei Obukhov, a former Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister, has demanded an apology from Britain for MI6's 'cynical' operation to extract information from his son in the full knowledge he was mentally disturbed. The allegation in the memoirs of renegade spy Richard Tomlinson that MI6 staff referred to Platon Obukhov as 'completely off his rocker' comes as a new embarrassment to the British secret services, calling into question the ethics of its spy recruitment. Tomlinson claims that MI6 officials were under such pressure to meet pre-set targets of CX (the MI6 code for secret intelligence) from Russia they were ready to overlook not only the morality of recruiting such an informant, but also the quality of the information he could provide. Platon Obukhov is held in one of Moscow's harshest prisons, his mental health rapidly deteriorating, with no access to treatment.

To others she is responsible for encouraging one of the most evil trades practised on the globe. She is haggling for slaves. In front of her are two masked traders. Between them is a leather suitcase containing $24,000 (\u00a316,000) in banknotes. Under nearby trees 300 slaves, mostly women and children with their wrists tied and confusion etched on their faces, squat while their destiny is bartered over. She is Baroness Cox, educationalist, writer and a Deputy Speaker of the House of Lords. But now she is thousands of miles away from the cloisters of Westminster, engaged on a perilous mission within range of artillery on the front line in the brutal Sudanese civil war, to rescue a wretched band of Sudanese peasants from a life of captivity. 'We are happy to offer $50 per person. Is that acceptable to the gentlemen?' Cox asks. The two dealers look down and ease their toes in and out of their plastic flip-flops. They elbow their translator. 'You tell the lady frankly that we have bought every person here from slave owners for one million Sudanese currency, equivalent to $200.

Tobacco manufacturers say the taxes encourage cross-Channel smuggling but a Customs and Excise spokesman said 'criminals' should not undermine health policy. He said new resources would slow, and eventually halt, smuggling. </p> <p><b> Shoppers clean up </b><br></p> <p>Thousands of bargain hunters descended on a warehouse in Sheffield to buy items people had forgotten to pick up from dry cleaners.

Tobacco tax 'justified' Customs officials have defended the government policy of levying heavy taxes on cigarettes after new figures showed tobacco consumption had risen for the first time in 25 years. Tobacco manufacturers say the taxes encourage cross-Channel smuggling but a Customs and Excise spokesman said 'criminals' should not undermine health policy. He said new resources would slow, and eventually halt, smuggling. Shoppers clean up Thousands of bargain hunters descended on a warehouse in Sheffield to buy items people had forgotten to pick up from dry cleaners. They included wedding outfits, designer suits and a set of racing silks.

Writer's jail sentence grows Egyptian writer Salaheddin Mohsen has been sentenced by the high state security court to three years' jail with hard labour for 'blasphemy against Islam'. It stiffened his original six-month suspended sentence after the intervention of the state prosecutor.

When the deportations began, my father got me a job in the glass factory, which saved my life. Ben worked there, too. But my mother and sister were deported. After the war I found out they had been murdered at Treblinka. Back then I knew nothing - it was better that way. </p> <p> At the end of 1944, my father and I were sent to the death camp Buchenwald. A few months later, when he was nearly dying, I was forced to leave him. I was packed in an open cattle truck and for a month the train went backwards and forwards. There was no food, people were dying. By the time the transport arrived at the death camp Theresienstadt, I was barely alive. </p> <p> In May 1945 the Russians liberated the camp. A few weeks later, I saw Ben; it was wonderful to have a friend who'd survived. In June we were running around with other kids in the field outside Theresienstadt - the freedom was unbelievable. </p> <p> Ben and I were in the same group of child survivors permitted to enter Britain in 1945. In Windermere, we learnt English, talked about girls and getting a job. I went to Scotland and became a watchmaker. We met up again in 1949 in London at a club set up to assist our rehabilitation.

      "bodyText": "Krulik Wilder I've known Ben since we were 12 years old. We lived in the same ghetto, Piotrkow, in Poland. When the deportations began, my father got me a job in the glass factory, which saved my life. Ben worked there, too. But my mother and sister were deported. After the war I found out they had been murdered at Treblinka. Back then I knew nothing - it was better that way. At the end of 1944, my father and I were sent to the death camp Buchenwald. A few months later, when he was nearly dying, I was forced to leave him. I was packed in an open cattle truck and for a month the train went backwards and forwards. There was no food, people were dying. By the time the transport arrived at the death camp Theresienstadt, I was barely alive. In May 1945 the Russians liberated the camp. A few weeks later, I saw Ben; it was wonderful to have a friend who'd survived. In June we were running around with other kids in the field outside Theresienstadt - the freedom was unbelievable. Ben and I were in the same group of child survivors permitted to enter Britain in 1945. In Windermere, we learnt English, talked about girls and getting a job. I went to Scotland and became a watchmaker. We met up again in 1949 in London at a club set up to assist our rehabilitation. Ben asked me to do weight-lifting with him and I was very impressed when he became British champion and competed at the Olympics. He went to university (to study economics) and I started my own jewellery business. In 1963 we helped found the '45 Aid Society Holocaust Survivors.

      "body": "<p>'Erm... had any experience with one of these?' asks the Suzuki representative nervously, as I clunk on my crash helmet and confidently bounce into the saddle of the King Quad LT300, the big seller of Suzuki's range of ATVs (that's All Terrain Vehicles to you and me). I hesitate momentarily. A huge and friendly looking paddock spreads out ahead of me with no oncoming vehicles, no loose animals or children and no motorway maintenance men to get in my way. As far as I am concerned, I am sitting on a motorbike with stabilisers. How difficult can it be? Hell, Suzuki even manufactures a range of ATVs for six and 12-year-olds. 'I had a go on a moped in Greece once,' I say hopefully. 'So how fast can I go?' I ask, chomping at the bit to open her up and blaze a trail across the field. 'It's the skill, not the race,' I am told sternly.</p> <p>I set off on the King Quad LT300 and feel as though, if not for the helmet, the wind would be rushing through my hair just like Marianne Faithfull in Girl on a Motorcycle . I look down at the speedo and see that I am in fact hitting a maximum of 5kph with the wind behind me. Time to crank up a gear, I think, and therein lies the problem, in my opinion, with the King Quad manual. To go up a gear, you have to curl your toe under the pedal and flick it up, while at the same time lowering the throttle by releasing pressure on the thumb grip. It was all a bit much for someone with my hopeless hand-eye co-ordination, and I ended up slowing down to a virtual standstill every time I changed gear.</p> <p>For those who really can't get to grips with the gears, though, Suzuki has just introduced the Quad Master, an automatic version of its most powerful ATV, the 500, with rumours abounding that an automatic 350 will soon also be available. I have to confess, the 500 really was a different ball game. Though the automatic gears do take some of the fun out of driving, particularly on a muddy incline where the gears play a major part in control, the automatic allows you to turn the throttle and get up to speed more quickly. The engine responds beautifully and, throwing caution to the breeze, I went full speed across the paddock and reached 55kph. Any faster and I knew that hitting a tree stump or a large rock would result in one of those accidents which everybody seemed so keen for me to avoid.</p> <p>The King Quad 300 has three drive options; two-wheel drive, four-wheel drive and front-differential-locked four-wheel drive for difficult conditions. There is also a five-speed subtransmission with high, low and super-low ratios. Turning has a slower response than I expected and there is a fair amount of weight shifting to keep stability on a corner or on a slope, but that all adds to the fun.</p> <p>Sitting on a powerful engine with little protection means safety features highly on the ATV's list of must dos. A training course is recommended, as is a helmet and sensible and protective clothing. There is also a safety wire attaching you to a cut-off switch which is activated should your body become separated from your vehicle.</p> <p>All ATVs have a centrifugal clutch system so comparing the quad bike to a scooter gives you some idea what they are all about. The clutch operates automatically and disengages itself when acceleration is low. But be warned, when toiling up a steep hill, the tendency is to open the throttle up in an attempt to get more power. The clutch then engages suddenly and the vehicle transforms itself into a bucking bronco. Although the automatic obviously uses the same clutch system, all the hard work is done for you and there is less potential danger.</p> <p>Over the past decade, Quad bikes have earned themselves a reputation as sporting vehicles in the US, where big space for outdoor pursuits permits. In the UK, however, the majority of ATV sales are represented by farmers. 'It didn't compute with me at first,' says Nigel Hulme, an entrepreneur and the UK distributor of AGIP oil and who runs his 80-acre estate near Crawley with the help of ATVs. 'A four-wheeled motorbike? What's that going to do for me?' In reality, a quad bike suits his purposes admirably. 'It's incredibly versatile and inherently safe if you treat it properly.'</p> <p>The popularity of the ATV as a farming vehicle coincided with the agricultural recession. It's much cheaper to run than a tractor in terms of fuel and tyres. 'It's also easier to use than a tractor, especially on a smaller farm,' says Nigel. 'It's compact and makes no mess.' Its low-pressure tyres mean a growing crop recovers from being driven over and weighing in at only 3lb per square inch, it does no more damage than a farmer in his wellies. Also on the practical side, it's quicker to open and close gates as the farmer can remain seated on his ATV.</p> <p>The quad really comes into its own when it is completed with accessories. There's a whole spectrum of attachments which enable it to mow the grass, transport heavy loads, level the riding school arena, grade dirt tracks and aerate a grass field. All in all, the quad becomes farmer's little helper as well as being a fun and nippy way of getting around the acreage.</p> <p>Farmers wherever there are hills and animals (that means Wales mostly) are Suzuki's main clients, although they are currently targeting equestrian centres as high ATV users. As farmers' wives and to-the-manor-born ladies are often responsible for the horses, women ATV drivers are on the increase.</p> <p>According to Nigel, there's a queue in his household to mow the lawn. 'It's a useable tool which can be fun,' he says. 'I never have trouble getting volunteers.' And as a classic-sportscar racing enthusiast with endless trophies to prove his various exploits, Nigel knows all about vehicles as entertainment. And the King Quad is definitely great fun. Suzuki is keen to point out that its ATVs are work vehicles and not sports machines, but combining work with driving around on these chunky bikes almost makes grafting a pleasure.</p> <p>If I were a farmer, I'd be at the front of the queue to buy a shiny new quad bike.

If a woman lights up a post-prandial snout and he says: 'I don't want to be a jerk, but I can't date a smoker', is this indeed instant and irrefutable proof of a man's jerkiness? If a woman waits too long to sleep with him, does she run the risk of 'missing the window and becoming good friends'? If a man shouts out: 'You whore!' at the moment of orgasm, should a woman take it in her stride or take up tapestry? And if a woman is still serial-dating in her thirties, is it sensible to wonder 'how many men are too many men?' No doubt about it, <strong>Sex and The City</strong> never fights shy of tackling the Big Stuff. </p> <p>You think I'm joking? Far from it. Despite the vast, rent-controlled Upper East Side apartments and the expensive heels, sometimes Sex and The City looks like a dirty-realist document strand. I doubt there's an urban single woman in the land who hasn't listened to Sarah Jessica Parker's Carrie Bradshaw without wincing at least once an episode. And, most rarely in the context of American comedy drama, the show never succumbs to schmaltz. </p> <p>When a man runs Carrie a candlelit bubble-bath, she says: 'Wow, it looks like a Danielle Steele novel in here', which is as it should be, because men who think cheap, quasi-romantic, Cosmo , girlish courtship rituals are the fastest way into a adult woman's bed deserve everything they won't get. Then again, it may just be because last week was such a profoundly dire seven days for TV drama - indeed, the worst I can remember outside of August - that Sex and the City looked so damn good. </p> <p>More sex in C4's <strong>Better Sex</strong>, in which we followed Relate's psycho-sexual counsellors and their clients. In a training session for would-be therapists, the group sat down to watch a video featuring a pair of 1970's Californian Joy-of-Socks-and-Sandals types getting it on to a soundtrack of such overwrought cheesiness that it could have been a very early work by TV's King of Strings, W.G. Snuffy Walden. </p> <p>Afterwards, invited to discuss their reactions, the answer to the question: 'So, what sort of person wants to become a sex therapist anyway?' turned out to be the sort of middle-aged women who kick off their critique by saying: 'Normally when you watch a pornographic film...' Clearly, I must stay in more. </p> <p>But the heart of the story lay, as it were, with Petula and Chris from Cardiff: 34 years of happy marriage and a clutch of grown-up kids, when, bam!, thanks to press coverage about abuse in children's homes, Petula was reminded of her own long-suppressed memories of childhood sexual abuse and decided she couldn't stand her husband making love to her ever again. </p> <p>Petula's courage in, first, addressing this issue, then going to Relate and, finally, allowing herself to be filmed was, clearly, above and beyond, but it made for fine, optimistic television. I didn't warm to Gareth, the couple's counsellor - too young, too male, not much of a listener and with far too much Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen hair - but his prescription ('sensate-focus' - basically a massage without hidden extras) seemed to work ('It's like we've started courting again!' admitted Chris, blushingly). </p> <p>Relate may be justifiably proud of the fact that 20 per cent of clients rekindle their sex lives by the end of their treatment, even if the best way to ensure great sex appears to be to have no sex at all. Can't see this one working for Carrie Bradshaw and friends. </p> <p>Week Two in Borneo and, for the <strong>Jungle Janes</strong>, the desire for sex is probably somewhere just above the desire to wear stilettos. Though the narrative is exhaustingly riveting (every time the women took a break and reached for a fag, I'd find myself doing the same), visually this series sucks: Borneo looks like a very unimaginatively designed set for a cheap remake of Tenko , so even when the women complained about one site for a camp being 'too jungly' (cue fits of giggles), we couldn't see how it was any junglier than the jungle they had just heroically negotiated. Still, I'm more than happy to take their word for it. </p> <p>Though this exercise looks hellish, the women are all shaping up to be a bunch of Lara Crofts, though without the fun of slaying grunting thugs and retrieving a series of fluorescent, wiggly, computer-generated treasures en route . They also take it in turns to cry against the manly chest of their expedition leader, Major Ken Hames (Army, Retd), but who can blame them when Major Ken comes on like a cross between Castaway Ben Fogle and a Relate counsellor? 'Tonight the stars will be shining, the moon will be out and all will be well.' Cut to night-shot of the women sheltering under plastic sheets in the torrential rain. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, it's the emotional journeys that makes Jungle Janes such compulsive viewing. All have their coping mechanisms, from Catholicism ('Now I know how Jesus felt carrying the cross') to HRT to near-constant laughter ('If we can keep laughing, especially at ourselves, then we can't go far wrong'). </p> <p>I'm also in awe because I know I'd last a day, at best. None of these women is looking for validation from a man, but it can't hurt that Major Ken is fulsome in his praise of their efforts: 'The UK Special Forces come to Borneo to sort the wheat from the chaff.' Happily, all the women appear to have chaff allergies. </p> <p>Christa McAuliffe, another envelope-pusher who would have seen the Borneo jungle as a walk in the park, was the star of the doomed Challenger space shuttle mission, but it's easy to forget there was a whole crew whose names aren't as easily recalled. Finally, 15 years after the event we got to find out precisely how doomed the ship was in the excellent <strong>Challenger: Go For Launch</strong>. </p> <p>One Nasa employee returned home to his wife and met her 'Nice day at the office, dear?' inquiry with a despairing: 'They're going to launch tomorrow and kill the astronauts, but other than that it was a great day.' Yes, that's how doomed it was. Like the Titanic, a series of cost-cutting cock-ups and management blunders pretty much ensured the shuttle would fail. I'd always consoled myself with the thought that, when it came, the end probably came pretty fast, but no: apparently, the astronauts may have been conscious as the explosion of half-a-million gallons of liquid oxygen and hydrogen propelled them towards the sea at 200mph. Which makes it all the more extraordinary that Barbara, McAuliffe's understudy in the programme gave up teaching and carried on training, qualifying as an astronaut in 1999.

      "bodyText": "Sex and The City C4 Better Sex C4 Jungle Janes C4 Challenger: Go For Launch BBC2 Restaurants From Hell ITV Changing Rooms BBC1 If a man is a bad kisser, is he necessarily bad everywhere else? If a woman lights up a post-prandial snout and he says: 'I don't want to be a jerk, but I can't date a smoker', is this indeed instant and irrefutable proof of a man's jerkiness? If a woman waits too long to sleep with him, does she run the risk of 'missing the window and becoming good friends'? If a man shouts out: 'You whore!' at the moment of orgasm, should a woman take it in her stride or take up tapestry? And if a woman is still serial-dating in her thirties, is it sensible to wonder 'how many men are too many men?' No doubt about it, Sex and The City never fights shy of tackling the Big Stuff. You think I'm joking? Far from it. Despite the vast, rent-controlled Upper East Side apartments and the expensive heels, sometimes Sex and The City looks like a dirty-realist document strand. I doubt there's an urban single woman in the land who hasn't listened to Sarah Jessica Parker's Carrie Bradshaw without wincing at least once an episode. And, most rarely in the context of American comedy drama, the show never succumbs to schmaltz. When a man runs Carrie a candlelit bubble-bath, she says: 'Wow, it looks like a Danielle Steele novel in here', which is as it should be, because men who think cheap, quasi-romantic, Cosmo , girlish courtship rituals are the fastest way into a adult woman's bed deserve everything they won't get. Then again, it may just be because last week was such a profoundly dire seven days for TV drama - indeed, the worst I can remember outside of August - that Sex and the City looked so damn good. More sex in C4's Better Sex, in which we followed Relate's psycho-sexual counsellors and their clients. In a training session for would-be therapists, the group sat down to watch a video featuring a pair of 1970's Californian Joy-of-Socks-and-Sandals types getting it on to a soundtrack of such overwrought cheesiness that it could have been a very early work by TV's King of Strings, W.G. Snuffy Walden. Afterwards, invited to discuss their reactions, the answer to the question: 'So, what sort of person wants to become a sex therapist anyway?' turned out to be the sort of middle-aged women who kick off their critique by saying: 'Normally when you watch a pornographic film...' Clearly, I must stay in more. But the heart of the story lay, as it were, with Petula and Chris from Cardiff: 34 years of happy marriage and a clutch of grown-up kids, when, bam!, thanks to press coverage about abuse in children's homes, Petula was reminded of her own long-suppressed memories of childhood sexual abuse and decided she couldn't stand her husband making love to her ever again. Petula's courage in, first, addressing this issue, then going to Relate and, finally, allowing herself to be filmed was, clearly, above and beyond, but it made for fine, optimistic television. I didn't warm to Gareth, the couple's counsellor - too young, too male, not much of a listener and with far too much Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen hair - but his prescription ('sensate-focus' - basically a massage without hidden extras) seemed to work ('It's like we've started courting again!' admitted Chris, blushingly). Relate may be justifiably proud of the fact that 20 per cent of clients rekindle their sex lives by the end of their treatment, even if the best way to ensure great sex appears to be to have no sex at all. Can't see this one working for Carrie Bradshaw and friends. Week Two in Borneo and, for the Jungle Janes, the desire for sex is probably somewhere just above the desire to wear stilettos. Though the narrative is exhaustingly riveting (every time the women took a break and reached for a fag, I'd find myself doing the same), visually this series sucks: Borneo looks like a very unimaginatively designed set for a cheap remake of Tenko , so even when the women complained about one site for a camp being 'too jungly' (cue fits of giggles), we couldn't see how it was any junglier than the jungle they had just heroically negotiated. Still, I'm more than happy to take their word for it. Though this exercise looks hellish, the women are all shaping up to be a bunch of Lara Crofts, though without the fun of slaying grunting thugs and retrieving a series of fluorescent, wiggly, computer-generated treasures en route . They also take it in turns to cry against the manly chest of their expedition leader, Major Ken Hames (Army, Retd), but who can blame them when Major Ken comes on like a cross between Castaway Ben Fogle and a Relate counsellor? 'Tonight the stars will be shining, the moon will be out and all will be well.' Cut to night-shot of the women sheltering under plastic sheets in the torrential rain. Unsurprisingly, it's the emotional journeys that makes Jungle Janes such compulsive viewing. All have their coping mechanisms, from Catholicism ('Now I know how Jesus felt carrying the cross') to HRT to near-constant laughter ('If we can keep laughing, especially at ourselves, then we can't go far wrong'). I'm also in awe because I know I'd last a day, at best. None of these women is looking for validation from a man, but it can't hurt that Major Ken is fulsome in his praise of their efforts: 'The UK Special Forces come to Borneo to sort the wheat from the chaff.' Happily, all the women appear to have chaff allergies. Christa McAuliffe, another envelope-pusher who would have seen the Borneo jungle as a walk in the park, was the star of the doomed Challenger space shuttle mission, but it's easy to forget there was a whole crew whose names aren't as easily recalled. Finally, 15 years after the event we got to find out precisely how doomed the ship was in the excellent Challenger: Go For Launch. One Nasa employee returned home to his wife and met her 'Nice day at the office, dear?' inquiry with a despairing: 'They're going to launch tomorrow and kill the astronauts, but other than that it was a great day.' Yes, that's how doomed it was. Like the Titanic, a series of cost-cutting cock-ups and management blunders pretty much ensured the shuttle would fail. I'd always consoled myself with the thought that, when it came, the end probably came pretty fast, but no: apparently, the astronauts may have been conscious as the explosion of half-a-million gallons of liquid oxygen and hydrogen propelled them towards the sea at 200mph. Which makes it all the more extraordinary that Barbara, McAuliffe's understudy in the programme gave up teaching and carried on training, qualifying as an astronaut in 1999. She is now preparing to fly shuttles herself and I doubt she loses much sleep over men who are bad kissers. Bravery is, of course, relative. For Barbara and the Jungle Janes it's about digging deep to discover one's inner Right Stuff, while for the rest of us it might be surviving one of the Restaurants From Hell. Here, I was delighted to see a hideous Aberdeen Angus Steak House - venue for the worst British restaurant meal I have ever eaten (beaten only by something unspeakable I once consumed in Soviet Russia) - being exposed as the House of Vermin Droppings and Bad Sewerage Smells. It is a mystery how they stay in business but, in the meantime, I guess even a little Health and Safety prosecution helps to undermine a company that still turns over \u00a320 million a year. With its litany of e-coli 0517, salmonella, deep-fried lizards and quarter pounders with mould, I'd have said Restaurants From Hell was the most blackly comedic programme of the week, until I saw Changing Rooms. Confronted by a demanding, design-conscious bunch of 'performance artists', the designer's (slip) covers were finally blown. Obviously, there's only room for a handful of stars in the show but, as the camp split in two and Carol Smillie consoled Anna Ryder Richardson ('They're wearing me down'; 'Yeah, I feel a bit sorry for you'), it was clear that the stars must never be the contestants - much less those who might know their Barratt from their Bauhaus or recognise that wacky installations made from polystyrene look 's--t'.

Italian specialists Valvona &amp; Crolla (19 Elm Row, Edinburgh; 0131 556 6066) are currently importing unwaxed Tarocco oranges from Sicily (\u00a32.60 per kg), whose flesh begins the season (in December) a regular orange colour, but then turns blood red in January. Because they are unwaxed, their shelf life is short, but the zest can be used confidently for all sorts of culinary purposes. Indeed, their Caff\u00e8 Bar outlet enables Valvona &amp; Crolla to produce lots of sidelines, from dark red juice, via macerated slices in sugar and Marsala, to caramelised orange syrups to accompany panna cotta or chocolate cake. Sicilian blood oranges (for juicing) and unwaxed oranges can also be found at Villandry (170 Great Portland Street, London W1; 020 7631 3131) for about 45p each, alongside bitter Seville oranges at 35p each. Although they originated in China, oranges have long been a staple in the Mediterranean and Middle East. Among restaurants of that ilk making good use of the fruit, Moro (34-36 Exmouth Market, London EC1; 020 7833 8336) turns out a Seville orange tart of some distinction, based on a classic lemon tart with a curdy filling. The adaptation recognises the appealingly sour quality of bitter oranges such as Seville. When it comes to equipment, Lakeland (Alexandra Buildings, Windermere, Cumbria; 015394 88100) is a handy outlet. An orange peeler (made from local horn) sells for \u00a34.25, and its ceramic pudding basin comes with a funnel up the middle (so sponge puddings cook from the inside as well), and the top is notched round the edge to make it easier to tie with a loop of string. This 1.5 pint (850ml) 'Quick Cooker' bowl costs \u00a317.95. \u0095 Jim Ainsworth is editor of The Good Food Guide.",

      "body": "<p>A baby's breath is the sweetest thing you will ever smell. I was reminded of this the other day when watching a friend putting her nose nearly into her baby son's mouth and just inhaling. It is pure olfactory perfection, better then freshly mown grass or roses or hot chocolate, or whatever else people usually say their favourite smell is. You can't help imagining it bottled up and labelled 'Innocence', so that you could keep it for posterity. Wouldn't that be great, so that you can sniff it years on when your teenager comes back on a Saturday night reeking of Bulmers cider and Silk Cut?</p> <p>Children's breath is usually pretty nice, too - except when they've got a bad cold and it smells a bit like old flower water. Unlike adult breath, it has no trace of fags, booze, curry, tooth decay or the effects of dieting, and is usually something you are pretty pleased to smell - even first thing in the morning. Which is why I was so concerned when my nine-year-old son's breath turned from sweet to unbelievably sour overnight.</p> <p>It was an almost chemical smell, which I had to force myself not to recoil from when he jumped on my bed in the morning. Kids in his class were not so kind - particularly the girl who asked him if he was 'rotting'. I wondered if at his tender age some kind of hormone had kicked in, marking the end of childhood by some pungent odour. Oddly enough, my son thought the same sort of thing. Among his pals, BO under armpits is an exciting sign of becoming 'manly', and he decided to regard bad breath as the same sort of thrilling sign of a coming of age. He laughed when his sister fled from his dragon-like breath.</p> <p>I turned to the web and typed in 'halitosis'. Dozens and dozens of American breath clinics selling tongue scrapers and new kinds of toothpaste and mouthwash came up. Reading through them, I was advised that the most common reason for bad breath is connected with the teeth. Apparently, few people brush long enough to remove bacteria from their teeth and these bacteria feast on food particles left on our teeth, creating smelly gases. If you don't floss, then the odour-producing bacteria grows rampantly in the spaces between your teeth. Your tongue, too, can harbour bacteria - particularly at the back.</p> <p>So, I started to supervise my son's twice-daily brushes once again, just as I had done when he was younger. I taught him how to floss (actually surprisingly difficult) and got him to brush his tongue as far back as he could without gagging. Despite a good 10 minutes of oral hygiene, his breath still smelt of boot polish. We tried all the over-the-counter mouthwashes but they seemed to make the smell even more intense and, fearing he had a serious dental problem such as gingivitis or an abscess, I took him to our dentist, who could find nothing wrong. My husband became convinced that the answer was masses of water and my poor son found himself having to drink glass after glass of water. I started secretly to worry. What an earth could make a child's breath smell as rancid as this? Surely it might be the sign of something really serious? I knew it wasn't the diabetic pear-drop breath smell or a problem with his tonsils, as he'd had them taken out when he was four. I was deeply concerned that he might have an infection (or worse) of the chest or the stomach.</p> <p>I visited the doctor, and although I saw her wrinkle her nose when she asked him to breath on her, she clearly thought I was neurotic, told me that it was just one of those things and gave me a prescription for yet another mouthwash that didn't just mask my son's breath but seemed to bring out the chemical smell even more. He was still being teased at school and was allowed by the teacher to carry fresh-breath capsules, spray and mints - none of which helped for more then a few seconds.</p> <p>So, never having been in the slightest bit 'alternative', I went back to the homeopath who actually took time to talk to my son about things that might be concerning him. She explained that bad breath was often stress related, because stress dries up the mouth, and a good flow of saliva was very important. My son suffers from allergies and has to take antihistamine quite regularly, so I asked her if the two things might be related. She gave him two little pills which he said tasted nice and, a couple of weeks later, the bad breath disappeared - which coincided with a trip to Turkey.</p> <p>By the time term came again, however, the terrible boot-polish smell had returned and I was ashamed of the way it made me less inclined to hug him. I went back to my GP once again and was told there was nothing they could do about breath and that they were sure I didn't want 'invasive action' for a problem that, after all, was not so serious. So it was back to the soft-voiced homeopath who my son enjoyed chatting to about the problems of homework - but this time the little pills didn't work.</p> <p>By now, I was starting to build up a bit of an email relationship with a breath expert in America. I was grateful for the American ability to embrace such a problem that obviously even embarrassed GPs over here, even if I knew they were trying to sell their products and get people to come and use their halometers (machines that measure the amount of gases in the breath). I tried really hard to explain just what the breath smelt like and Dr Gary Herskovits asked if I thought it might be a reaction to milk. I found that really hard to believe, even though my son had suffered a severe reaction to cow's milk when he was a baby. I wrote and said that as he only had cow's milk on his cereal and never ate cheese, I thought it pretty unlikely. I didn't stop him drinking milk until nearly a month later, when a friend told me her son's breath had improved dramatically since she had started to give him toast for breakfast. We tried it and within a day the smell had gone. That was more than two months ago and explained why it had stopped smelling in Turkey - we had eaten figs and bread and honey for two weeks.</p> <p>Why did this happen? I tracked down Dr Philip Stemmer, who runs one of the only centres specialising in bad breath in this country - the Fresh Breath Centre. 'Allergic reaction to foods such as milk and wheat can add to what we call the post-nasal drip, where mucus falls on to the back of the tongue,' he explained.

Around this time, the Bay Area human-potential movement had grown into a global self-help industry, known euphemistically as the 'new age'. The new age got married to IT and now you can get enlightenment from logging on to various websites. It's that simple. So we've solved it. No more nervous breakdowns (you're out, Auntie Ethel), no more stiff upper lips (unless you've had too much collagen injected), no more staying up all night taking drugs and having your upper brain stem rattled by digital jackhammers. Now the answer to life on a planet of dwindling resources fast nearing the point of not being able to sustain us any longer, where there are no new frontiers to explore (except dread and dreary places like Mars and the moon), can be found on a website. Sorted.</p> <p>Except obviously we're not. Otherwise why are so many of us so angry that we resort to violence at the drop of a hat? Why do we consume enough alcohol every week to fill all the craters of the moon? The fact is that no one ever taught us how to communicate - with ourselves and each other - and we no longer have any memory of the old-school social protocol that kept the world glued together in Ethel and Arthur's era.</p> <p>In the light of the vast wealth of self-development knowledge readily available, it would be easy for every schoolchild to be instructed in rudimentary communication skills and martial arts (to sublimate the violent urge). How wonderful it would be if every parent should be obliged to train in basic ethics and induced by tax breaks to pass on a simple code of human decency or at least good manners to their kids.</p> <p>In the meantime, however, we have to deal with our own bad selves, stamping our feet because we want more and we want it now. All this anger causes problems with our liver energy and needs a safe outlet before we all start losing the collective plot. The stress of external life will only increase now, especially as that naughty old recession starts biting our trouser legs. It is therefore crucial, if we wish to maintain a semblance of social propriety that would enable us to get along with each other, that we must quickly learn to relax more internally as individuals and with each other.</p> <p>One way to let off steam safely and promote inner peace is to go out for a walk every day to your nearest park or open space, breathing deeply and letting your mind take a brief holiday. If you have no close canine friends to accompany you, take an imaginary one and, when you get to the park, yell his or her name a few times at the top of your lungs. No one will know you don't have an actual dog, so there's no need to feel embarrassed about it. If you're very vain, take a dog lead to make it look more authentic. My imaginary dog's name is Rowley, by the way. I find it a wholesome sound to yell - the 'ow' bit helps release any emotional pain that's been accruing. So if you see a funny looking bloke with no shoes yelling 'Rowley' on Hampstead Heath, keep it to yourself.</p> <p><b>Your questions</b></p> <p>Dear Barefoot Doctor, I am 33 and I have really bad cramps the day before each period, then bleed ferociously for one day only. Premenstrual tension and fluid retention seems worse every month with strong mood swings. I keep fit and am in good shape otherwise. Is this normal for a woman of my age?<br><b> Lorraine Fisher, Cardiff</b></p> <p>Dear Lorraine, this is quite common, but you should perhaps arrange a scan to check everything's physically in order. As you know, 33 is the age when your womb cries out for a baby and it is probably this hormonal build-up that causes the worsening PMS. However, the water retention makes it sound like your kidneys need adjusting and the sudden bleed for one day only sounds like your liver and spleen are out of balance. Try a session of acupuncture around ovulation for three or four months to fix your kidneys, liver and spleen energies; take agnus castus, which seems to help rebalance hormones, and be sure to eat an iron-rich diet, including buckets of watercress from mid-cycle on.</p> <p>Dear Doc, for some years, I have suffered from dermatitis in my ears (nowhere else). They itch and shed flakes of dead skin. Is there any herbal preparation which might help to clear up this condition? <br><b> Joan Callaghan, Plymouth</b></p> <p>Dear Joan, the ears are the 'flowers' of the kidneys. This immediately makes me think of stress affecting your kidneys, for which shiatsu or acupuncture would be helpful. Also consider learning chi gung. In time, as your kidneys improve and your stress decreases, your ears should calm down. Short term, try massaging your ears lovingly every night with a preparation of lavender and marigold (calendula) - two or three drops of each in a saucer of warm olive oil.</p> <p>If you have any problems you would like answered, please write to Barefoot Doctor at Life magazine, The Observer , 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R3ER, or email him at <a href=\"mailto:barefoot.doctor@observer.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">barefoot.doctor@observer.co.uk</a>.

In the light of the vast wealth of self-development knowledge readily available, it would be easy for every schoolchild to be instructed in rudimentary communication skills and martial arts (to sublimate the violent urge). How wonderful it would be if every parent should be obliged to train in basic ethics and induced by tax breaks to pass on a simple code of human decency or at least good manners to their kids. In the meantime, however, we have to deal with our own bad selves, stamping our feet because we want more and we want it now. All this anger causes problems with our liver energy and needs a safe outlet before we all start losing the collective plot. The stress of external life will only increase now, especially as that naughty old recession starts biting our trouser legs. It is therefore crucial, if we wish to maintain a semblance of social propriety that would enable us to get along with each other, that we must quickly learn to relax more internally as individuals and with each other. One way to let off steam safely and promote inner peace is to go out for a walk every day to your nearest park or open space, breathing deeply and letting your mind take a brief holiday. If you have no close canine friends to accompany you, take an imaginary one and, when you get to the park, yell his or her name a few times at the top of your lungs. No one will know you don't have an actual dog, so there's no need to feel embarrassed about it. If you're very vain, take a dog lead to make it look more authentic. My imaginary dog's name is Rowley, by the way. I find it a wholesome sound to yell - the 'ow' bit helps release any emotional pain that's been accruing. So if you see a funny looking bloke with no shoes yelling 'Rowley' on Hampstead Heath, keep it to yourself. Your questions Dear Barefoot Doctor, I am 33 and I have really bad cramps the day before each period, then bleed ferociously for one day only. Premenstrual tension and fluid retention seems worse every month with strong mood swings. I keep fit and am in good shape otherwise. Is this normal for a woman of my age? Lorraine Fisher, Cardiff Dear Lorraine, this is quite common, but you should perhaps arrange a scan to check everything's physically in order. As you know, 33 is the age when your womb cries out for a baby and it is probably this hormonal build-up that causes the worsening PMS. However, the water retention makes it sound like your kidneys need adjusting and the sudden bleed for one day only sounds like your liver and spleen are out of balance. Try a session of acupuncture around ovulation for three or four months to fix your kidneys, liver and spleen energies; take agnus castus, which seems to help rebalance hormones, and be sure to eat an iron-rich diet, including buckets of watercress from mid-cycle on. Dear Doc, for some years, I have suffered from dermatitis in my ears (nowhere else). They itch and shed flakes of dead skin. Is there any herbal preparation which might help to clear up this condition? Joan Callaghan, Plymouth Dear Joan, the ears are the 'flowers' of the kidneys. This immediately makes me think of stress affecting your kidneys, for which shiatsu or acupuncture would be helpful. Also consider learning chi gung. In time, as your kidneys improve and your stress decreases, your ears should calm down. Short term, try massaging your ears lovingly every night with a preparation of lavender and marigold (calendula) - two or three drops of each in a saucer of warm olive oil. If you have any problems you would like answered, please write to Barefoot Doctor at Life magazine, The Observer , 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R3ER, or email him at barefoot.doctor@observer.co.uk.

      "body": "<p>In the reception area of the PR company Freud Communications, two sleek young publicists are briefing a client, a nervous-looking boy who keeps fiddling with his hair. 'We'll take you down to the J17 offices, and you'll meet Adam for 15 minutes before you both do the photo shoot. Give the impression that you're really pally, but don't go over the top,' says one, consulting a clipboard. 'Then they're going to ask you questions like, \"How can girls make themselves irresistible to men?\" We'll come up with some answers. And you're going to have to say that you're 19.' </p> <p>'Say you're a snowboarder,' suggests the other. </p> <p>'Or a DJ.' </p> <p>'A club promoter.' </p> <p>Freud's is the prime stall in the celebrity bazaar, pushing the profiles of such div- erse products as Nike, Pepsi and Martine McCutcheon. It also handles BT, and that's why Trevor Beattie is sitting backstage, in a small, windowless boardroom, telling me about an upcoming internet promotion to which he is attached as a 'celebrity judge'. The fact that Beattie now counts as a celebrity proves that he has not just been busy selling furniture stores and beer and fashion and face cream and tabloid newspapers; he has also been busy selling himself. </p> <p>Beattie is the flog prince. He is the man who gave us 'fcuk' and the Wonderbra billboards ('Hello boys' - although he didn't actually write that line) and the current David Lynch promo for PlayStation 2, featuring bandaged heads and talking ducks. In the industry, he is loathed and revered in equal measure. His enemies say his real talent is for recycling; his admirers say that no one can touch him when it comes to provoking a media hullaballoo. Now 40, he's facing his biggest challenge so far: in the run-up to the election, he's handling the New Labour account, thought to be worth \u00a310m. </p> <p>Beattie - corkscrew bob, lime-green jersey, waxy jeans bought in LA's Beverly Center, and a cheerful, misleadingly dopey mien - says the moment when Peter Mandelson, a friend since the days of the Shadow Communications Agency, rang through with the news that he had won the account was 'the greatest moment of my career'. He describes savouring the experience even as it was happening: taking the call in a crowded meeting, calculatedly suppressing his reaction so that when he put the phone down and broke the news, he and his colleagues at TBWA could celebrate together. 'The truth is, I'd rehearsed that moment in my mind for 15 years. And so I knew exactly what I was going to do. I didn't want to miss the moment by having them lot all go up while I was still talking on the phone. I wanted everyone, at the same moment, to feel how I felt.' </p> <p>Beattie became a Labour supporter (doggedly, he still calls himself a socialist) at the very instant when Mrs Thatcher said, 'There's no such thing as society.' He still gives the impression of being negatively motivated, of loathing the Tories much more than he loves New Labour. 'They can call it whatever they like, New Labour, whatever, but I know what my beliefs are, and they ain't Tory. The closest brand that exists to the product that I wish to buy is New Labour.' </p> <p>He boils issues down to personalities at every turn. Thatch is still the menacing shadow under the stairs, but Portillo and Widdecombe are similarly 'scary'. Talking about politics, he uses the word 'hate' repeatedly. One might have expected him to turn out a Third Way spin on the Tories' infamous Demon Eyes campaign, but thus far his New Labour billboards are more restrained, more seductive: touchy-feely domestic scenes, with characters lost in self-congratulatory reverie, contemplating the improvements wrought by the government they voted for ('I did that'). Beattie says that Tony is his 'ultimate creative director'. Peter and Gordon have a say too, but 'Tony sees everything'. 'A poster with a bra on, a poster with a car on - that's all right,' says Beattie, 'but it's not going to change the world. I feel more content now. I feel more that I'm making more of a contribution.' Beattie is hot on making a contribution. He says he has worked hard to get where he is today, but he has also been very lucky, and because of that, he owes a debt. 'People should boast about the tax they pay, not fiddle it. I pay an awful lot of tax and am pleased to do so.' He has worked on campaigns highlighting the horrors of domestic violence. He spent Christmas in Africa, making a film for Unicef. </p> <p>Because Beattie makes several references to How To Get Ahead in Advertising , the movie that satirised the 80s' ad industry, it suddenly dawns on me that whereas Richard E Grant's character had a talking boil on his shoulder, Trevor Beattie - whose other clients, let us not forget, include The Sun and Marlboro - sometimes seems to be hinting that he has a Jiminy Cricket on his. Small wonder that breathtaking cheekiness distinguishes his most successful campaigns. Make no mistake: that's Beattie, through and through. And my, how it winds people up. </p> <p>'How can anyone who works in the business who has seen How To Get Ahead in Advertising still have an office full of awards?' says Beattie. 'There are certain awards that the community says One Must Win - you know, the Oscars of the business. Because unless one wins them, one is merely a charlatan, dear boy. Oh bollocks! I can't be doing with all that.' </p> <p>But he enters, though. </p> <p>'I'll enter award schemes, and have won awards,' agrees Beattie, airily. 'It makes me smile. If I win, I give them to the clients. I never keep them. Seeing someone wearing a fcuk T-shirt is a great thrill - a much greater thrill than winning a bit of wood with some plastic stuck on.' </p> <p> Beattie was born in Birmingham. He is close to his mother, who is nearly 80, and talks with real pride about his dad, originally from Lisburn, County Down, who was a car mechanic and 'a real character. He was utterly uncompromising. He did it his way. When he died, there were 100 cars at the funeral. Everyone knew Jack Beattie.' The eight Beattie kids were raised in their dad's garage, 'a wonderland', where they were pleased to count spark plugs. Beattie, the fifth child, is the only one who is left cold by cars. Indeed, he has never sat behind a wheel. When I ask him if he has a driver, he says, 'Yeah. Bus driver.' But later, he volunteers that he takes a lot of taxis to and from Dalston, where he lives with his long-term girlfriend. </p> <p>While other boys collected stamps and conkers, Beattie collected TV jingles. He runs through them now: Cresta ('It's frothy, man'), Toblerone ('Triangular honey from triangular bees, triangular trees, oh Mr Confectioner, please, give me Toblerone'), Wrigley's ('Call it Wrigley's, call it spearmint, call it gum'), R White's, Shake 'n' Vac. He makes them sound like nursery rhymes. 'Fantastic!' says Beattie happily. He was the first member of his family to go on to further education, and studied graphic design and photography at Wolverhampton Polytechnic. A lecturer thought he might cut it as a copywriter and entered him in a national competition sponsored by Allen Brady &amp; Marsh. Beattie and a friend from the poly, Kaarl Hollis, won 'creative scholarships'. Within a year, the pair had made 11 Weetabix commercials - the ones with the stocky little Weetabix skinheads chanting, 'If you know what's good for you, OK' - which shifted a lot of breakfast cereal. </p> <p>It was the Wonderbra campaign in 1994 that made Beattie famous - notorious. Ex- colleagues, who had worked on the project before leaving the agency, grumbled that Beattie was taking credit for 'Hello, Boys!', a slogan he hadn't even written. 'I worked with a lot of different people on that campaign, the lead person being Nigel Rose, the art director who started the whole thing. It was lovely, it looked great,' sighs Beattie. 'But he really took the hump because he'd left by the time the work broke, and I was the spokesman for the agency. That's it! End of story. I did write all the other headlines. But I don't go around shouting about that. Who cares? What I say is: Nige, calm down, you did Wonderbra, it was great. And? It's all gone quiet. So do some more stuff.' </p> <p>Then there was the 1998 Strongbow slogan, 'Live to loaf', which The Idler magazine claimed was a rip-off of its tagline. And the fact that 'fcuk' was already in use in French Connection internal memos. And that Beattie's Guardian column slagging off the Gillette commercials turned out to be a reheated version of a piece originally written for Campaign . But Beattie thinks this 'hankie-stamping' is pathetic. 'Advertising is seeing ideas and using them, picking them up.' And in any case, you can't argue with a campaign like the one for fcuk because sales increased by 40 per cent, and \u00a35 was added to the share price, and 'because we've sold half a million T-shirts with \"fuck fashion\" on the front'. </p> <p>This makes me sit up, because elsewhere in the conversation, he has said, with a completely straight face, that the only people likely to confuse 'fcuk' with 'fuck' are dyslexics. </p> <p>'No, sorry,' says Beattie easily, 'I say fcuk usually. I usually just say fc.' </p> <p>You did say fuck just then, I insist primly. </p> <p>'I did it on purpose.' </p> <p> A few weeks later, Beattie invites me to the launch party for the new fcuk flagship store on Oxford Street. First, I meet him at the TBWA HQ in Fitzrovia. As you step out of the lift on the floor where the 'creatives' work in their multicoloured glass rabbit hutches, you walk right past a shelf upon which are arranged a clutch of objects that look remarkably like industry awards. Beattie, who is wearing lots of shiny, squeaky new materials from fcuk, is hastily eating chips from the wrapper, since he has been too busy for meals over the last few days. Big containers of salt and vinegar and HP Sauce are to hand, as are photographs of his heroes: Muhammad Ali, Nelson Mandela and, more mysteriously, Johnny Depp as Edward Scissorhands. Beattie loves Ali and Mandela with the same adolescent fervour with which he hates the Tories. </p> <p>When he has finished his chips, we catch a cab to the party. He's talking about the new fcuk campaign. He says it's really going to make people sit up and take notice. Taking a punt, I say, 'What, like \"fcuk the Pope\"?' Beattie looks reproachful. 'No, we're not going in that direction,' he says. 'Nothing so derogatory.' The taxi stops. The window display at the new store reads: 'fcuk Santa, let's shop'. </p> <p>Inside the shop, another of those white boxes with blond-wood floors and glass shelves, Beattie asks for a beer instead of the Bellinis on offer, and waves in a vague, shy fashion at the company's MD, Stephen Marks, and Joseph Ettedgui. Then he gives me a tour of the merchandise, his clothes making crisp-packet noises as he walks. Shortly afterwards, I find myself at the checkout, buying Beattie a pair of gloves. I can't remember quite how that came about, but it happened, and I hand over the carrier bag feeling a bit dazed. 'Thanks,' he says amiably. So perhaps it's true. Perhaps the guy really can make you buy anything.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Screamin' Jay Hawkins first made his name in 1956, wailing 'I Put A Spell On You'. He became famous for his stage antics - arriving in a coffin, carrying a juju stick and talking to a skull named Henry. He inspired both the name and act of the leader of the Monster Raving Loony Party, Screaming Lord Sutch. He sought infamy with the grunts and groans of 'Constipation Blues'. 'A subject like this must be put to music,' he said - and was rewarded with a hit in Japan.</p> <p>But he'll probably be best remembered for his sperm. Screamin' Jay claimed he had 57 offspring scattered around the globe - a figure presumably filched from a ketchup bottle. In later life, he reversed the digits, upping his claim to 75. He died, aged 70, nearly a year ago, in Paris, having spent 10 years in Honolulu and devoted most of his later years to sitting in a chair and smoking cigarettes. He'd been married six times and spent years in the forgiving arms of his mistress, Lee Angel, giant-breasted ex-stripper and former fianc\u00e9e of Little Richard. But none of Jay's women were at his funeral. Nor were any of those 57 or 75 kids. That was just a myth, wasn't it?</p> <p>Only it wasn't. There were hordes of little screamin' jays out there - well, not so little: most were conceived in the pre-Pill 50s. At the last count, the former Mr Jalacy Hawkins has 36 confirmed children, and another 40 or so possibles. Now that's what I call fertility. And carelessness. Not to mention absentee fatherhood. A good number of them are to meet for a reunion on 12 February, the anniversary of his death, in the Foundation Room of the House of Blues, Los Angeles. Some are 'official' children, born in wedlock - Irene Hawkins, for example, a 50-year-old graveyard-shift ambulance driver in Cleveland.

      "bodyText": "Screamin' Jay Hawkins first made his name in 1956, wailing 'I Put A Spell On You'. He became famous for his stage antics - arriving in a coffin, carrying a juju stick and talking to a skull named Henry. He inspired both the name and act of the leader of the Monster Raving Loony Party, Screaming Lord Sutch. He sought infamy with the grunts and groans of 'Constipation Blues'. 'A subject like this must be put to music,' he said - and was rewarded with a hit in Japan. But he'll probably be best remembered for his sperm. Screamin' Jay claimed he had 57 offspring scattered around the globe - a figure presumably filched from a ketchup bottle. In later life, he reversed the digits, upping his claim to 75. He died, aged 70, nearly a year ago, in Paris, having spent 10 years in Honolulu and devoted most of his later years to sitting in a chair and smoking cigarettes. He'd been married six times and spent years in the forgiving arms of his mistress, Lee Angel, giant-breasted ex-stripper and former fianc\u00e9e of Little Richard. But none of Jay's women were at his funeral. Nor were any of those 57 or 75 kids. That was just a myth, wasn't it? Only it wasn't. There were hordes of little screamin' jays out there - well, not so little: most were conceived in the pre-Pill 50s. At the last count, the former Mr Jalacy Hawkins has 36 confirmed children, and another 40 or so possibles. Now that's what I call fertility. And carelessness. Not to mention absentee fatherhood. A good number of them are to meet for a reunion on 12 February, the anniversary of his death, in the Foundation Room of the House of Blues, Los Angeles. Some are 'official' children, born in wedlock - Irene Hawkins, for example, a 50-year-old graveyard-shift ambulance driver in Cleveland. But most have been brought into the light by Maral Nigolian, an investment banker who became Jay's Boswell and took to flying to Paris to listen to the ageing R&amp;B star spin his past - a biography will appear at some point. When Jay died, Maral set up a website - www.jayskids.com. Have a look. It invited people to get in touch if they thought they were one of jayskids. There's no money involved. His will left what there was to his fifth ex-wife, Mary Lou Ahuna - causing his sixth wife, Monique, 31, to launch a legal challenge.

      "body": "<p>On maps of Haiti, National Highway 3 looks like a major thoroughfare. And, indeed, it is the gwo wout la , the big- gest road across the Central Plateau, a dirt track on which trucks of various sizes, overfilled with passengers, sway in and out of giant potholes, raising clouds of dust, their engines whining in low gear. A more numerous traffic plods along on donkeys and on foot, including a procession of the sick. They are headed for the village of Cange and the medical complex called Zanmi Lasante, Creole for Partners in Health. In an all-but-treeless landscape, it stands out like a fortress on a hillside, a large collection of concrete buildings half-covered by tropical greenery. Now and then on the road, a bed moves slowly towards it, a bearer at each corner, a patient on the mattress.</p> <p>Zanmi Lasante is famous on the Central Plateau, in part for its medical director, Dr Paul Farmer, known as Dokte Paul, or Polo, or, occasionally, Blan Paul. The women in Zanmi Lasante's kitchen call him ti blan mwen - 'my little white guy'. Peasant farmers like to remember how, during the violent years of the coup that deposed President Aritide, the unarmed Dokte Paul faced down a soldier who tried to enter the complex carrying a gun. One peasant told me, 'God gives everyone a gift, and his gift is healing.' A former patient once declared, 'I believe he is a god.' It was also said, in whispers, 'He works with both hands' - that is, both with science and with the magic necessary to remove ensorcellments, to many Haitians the deep cause of illnesses. Most of the encomiums seem to embarrass and amuse Farmer. But this last has a painful side. The Haitian belief in illness sent by sorcery thrives on deprivation, on the long absence of effective medicine. Farmer has dozens of voodoo priests among his patients.</p> <p>On an evening last January, Farmer sat in his office at Zanmi Lasante, dressed in his usual Haiti clothes - black pants and a T-shirt. He was holding aloft a large white plastic bottle. It contained Indinavir, one of the new protease inhibitors for treating Aids - the kind of magic he believes in. A sad-faced young man sat in the chair beside him. Patients never sat on the other side of his desk. He seemed bound to get as close to them as possible.</p> <p>Farmer is an inch or two over 6ft and thin, unusually long-legged and long-armed, and he has an agile way of folding himself into a chair and arranging himself around a patient he is examining that made me think of a grasshopper. He is about 40. There is a vigorous quality about his thinness. He has a narrow face and a delicate nose, which comes almost to a point. He peered at his patient through the little round lenses of wire-rimmed glasses. The young man had Aids. Farmer had been treating him with antibacterials, but his condition had worsened. The young man said he was ashamed.</p> <p>'Anybody can catch this. I told you that already,' Farmer said in Creole. He shook the bottle and the pills inside rattled. He asked the young man if he'd heard of this drug and the other new ones for Aids. The man hadn't. Well, Farmer said, the drugs didn't cure Aids, but they would take away his symptoms and, if he was lucky, let him live for many years as if he'd never caught the virus. Farmer would begin treating him soon. He had only to promise that he would never miss a dose. 'My situation is so bad,' the young man said. 'I keep injuring my head, because I'm living in such a crowded house. We have only one bed, and I let my children sleep on it, so I have to sleep under the bed, and I forget, and I hit my head when I sit up.' He went on, 'I don't forget what you did for me, Dokte Paul. When I was sick and no one would touch me, you used to sit on my bed with your hand on my head. I would like to give you a chicken or a pig.'</p> <p>When Farmer is relaxed, his skin is pale, with a suggestion of freckles underneath. Now it reddened instantly, from the base of his neck to his forehead. 'You've already given me a lot. Stop it!'</p> <p>The young man was smiling. 'I am going to sleep well tonight.'</p> <p>'OK, neg pa [my man].'</p> <p>Farmer put the bottle of pills back in his drawer. No one else is treating impoverished Haitians with the new anti-retroviral drugs. Even some of his allies in the Haitian medical establishment think he's crazy to try. The drugs could cost as much as $18,000 a year per patient. But the fact that the poor are dying of illnesses for which effective treatments exist is, like many global facts of life, unacceptable to Farmer. Indeed, to him it is a sin.</p> <p>Last autumn, he gave a speech to a group in Massachusetts called Cambridge Cares About Aids and said, 'Cambridge cares about Aids, but not nearly enough.' He wondered if he'd gone too far, but afterwards, at his suggestion, healthcare workers in the audience and people with Aids collected some unused drugs, and he ended up with enough to begin triple therapy for several of his Haitian patients. He is working on grant proposals to obtain a larger, more reliable supply. He doesn't seem to think there is a chance he'll fail. In his experience, when he begs for medicines someone always comes through. Begging of one sort or another is the main way in which he and others managed to create Zanmi Lasante. They didn't borrow, but he did a little stealing - the first microscope in Cange was one he had appropriated from Harvard Medical School.</p> <p>Farmer has chosen to work in one of Haiti's poorest regions. About 1m peasant farmers rely on the medical complex . About 100,000 live in its catchment area - the area for which the organisation provides community-health workers. On many nights, a hundred people camp out in the courtyard beside the ambulatory clinic; by morning, 300, sometimes more, are waiting for treatment. Unlike almost every other hospital in Haiti, Zanmi Lasante charges only nominal fees, and women and children and the seriously ill pay nothing. Partners in Health pays the bills, which are remarkably small. (Farmer spends about $200 to cure an uncomplicated case of tuberculosis in Haiti. The same cure in the US costs up to $20,000).</p> <p>Sometimes the pharmacy muddles a prescription or runs out of a drug. Now and then, the lab technicians lose a specimen. Seven doctors work at the complex, not all of them fully competent. But Zanmi Lasante has built schools and communal water systems for most of the villages in its catchment area. A few years back, when Haiti suffered an outbreak of typhoid resistant to the drugs usually used to treat it, Partners in Health imported an effective but expensive antibiotic, cleaned up the water supply, and stopped the outbreak in the Central Plateau. The medical complex has launched programmes in its catchment area for both the prevention and the treatment of Aids, and has reduced the vertical transmission rate (from mothers to babies) to 4 per cent. In Haiti, TB kills more adults than any other disease, but no one from the catchment area has died from it since 1988.</p> <p>Farmer now has these titles, among others: associate professor in two different departments at Harvard Medical School; member of the senior staff in Infectious Disease at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston; chief consultant on tuberculosis in Russian prisons for the World Bank (unpaid, at his insistence - he deplores some of the World Bank's policies); and founding director of Partners in Health.</p> <p>In 1993, the MacArthur Foundation gave Farmer one of its so-called genius grants. He had the entire sum sent to Partners in Health - in this case, some $220,000. During his medical-school years, Farmer camped out in Roxbury, in a garret in the rectory of St Mary of the Angels. Later, during sojourns in Boston, he stayed in the basement of Partners in Health headquarters, and he went on staying there after he got married - to Didi Bertrand, the daughter of the schoolmaster in Cange, and 'the most beautiful woman in Cange', people at Zanmi Lasante say. When a daughter was born, two years ago, Farmer saw no reason to change their Boston digs, but his wife did. Now they have an apartment at Harvard. He never sees his paychecks from Harvard and the Brigham. The bookkeeper at Partners in Health cashes them, pays his family's bills, and puts the rest away in the treasury. One day not long ago, Farmer tried to use his credit card and was told he'd reached his limit, so he called the bookkeeper. She told him, 'Honey, you are the hardest-working broke man I know.'</p> <p><b> By any standard, Farmer's life is complicated. </b> Didi, who is 31, and their daughter spend the academic year in Paris, where Didi is finishing her own studies in anthropology. Several friends have told Farmer that he should visit his family more often. 'But I don't have any patients in Paris,' he says forlornly. In theory, he works four months in Boston and the rest of the year in Haiti. In fact, those periods are all chopped up. Years ago, he got a letter from American Airlines welcoming him to its million-mile club. He has travelled at least 2m miles since. I spent a month with Farmer: a little more than two weeks in Haiti, with a short trip to South Carolina wedged in; five days in Cuba, at a conference on Aids; and the rest in Moscow, on TB business. He called this 'a light month for travel'. It had a certain roundness. A church group was, in effect, paying for his flight to South Carolina; the Cuban government covered his travel to Havana; and the Soros Foundation financed his trip to Moscow. 'Capitalists, Commies, and Jesus Christers are paying,' he said.</p> <p>When Paul Farmer goes on a long trip, he carries medicines and carrousels of slides and gifts of Haitian art for his hosts, and ends up with room for only three shirts. He owns one suit, which is black, so that he can, for example, wipe the fuzz off the tip of his pen on his trouser leg while writing up orders at the Brigham, catch a night flight to Lima or Moscow, and still look presentable when he arrives. En route to South Carolina, the zip on his trousers came apart. 'Oh well, I'll button my coat,' he said before his speech.</p> <p>He addressed a meeting of the Anderson County Medical Society. Some of its members visit Cange every year to treat patients free. Some in this particular audience were also church people - the Episcopal Diocese of Upper South Carolina has been making donations to Zanmi Lasante for almost two decades. It was a jacket-and-tie crowd. Farmer gave them his Haiti talk, a compendium of harsh statistics and cheerful photographs that showed what contributions from places such as South Carolina could do. Here was a photograph of a girl who had come to Zanmi Lasante with extra- pulmonary TB. She was bald, her limbs were wasted. And here was the same girl, with a full head of hair and chubby cheeks, smiling at the camera. Cries of surprise from the crowd, followed by applause. No matter who the audience, that pair of photographs always had the same effect. Farmer had felt jubilant, too, when he treated the girl, but the fact was that the 'before' picture more nearly represented the Haitian norm. When the applause died away, Farmer grinned. 'It's almost as if she had a treatable infectious disease.'</p> <p>Farmer likes to say that he and his colleagues will make common cause with anyone who is sincerely trying to change the 'political economies' of countries such as Haiti. In the meantime, though, the poor are suffering. They are 'dying like smelt', as Farmer puts it. 'He always kind of holds your feet to the fire,' the MC said when Farmer was done, and, indeed, the applause sounded only slightly more than polite.</p> <p>Like much of the audience, Farmer is himself religious. He subscribes to the Catholic doctrine called liberation theology, and to its central imperative - to provide 'a preferential option for the poor'. But, he told me, 'I hang on to my Catholicism by a tiny thread. I'm still looking for something in the sacred texts that prohibits using condoms.' Some of his beliefs, ones he hadn't openly expressed that night - for example, 'I think there should be a massive redistribution of wealth to places like Haiti' - would have seemed extreme to this sedate audience. Yet he liked these people a great deal.</p> <p>Farmer's politics are complex. He has problems with groups that on the surface would seem to be allies. With, for example, what he calls 'WLs' - 'white liberals', some of whose most influential spokespeople are black. 'I love WLs, love 'em to death. They're on our side,' Farmer once said, 'But WLs think all the world's problems can be fixed without any cost to themselves. We don't believe that. There's a lot to be said for sacrifice, remorse, even pity. It's what separates us from roaches.' As often as not, he prefers religious groups and what he calls 'church ladies'.</p> <p>We stayed at the house of a church lady that night, an impeccably genteel Southerner. She lived in a retirement community. When we arrived, one of her neighbours, a retired dentist, was repainting the movable flags on all the residents' mailboxes. Of our hostess, Farmer had said, 'She is a very good person. I'll take her over a Harvard smart-ass any day. I love her, actually.' I was a little puzzled. This woman wasn't a person you'd suspect of threatening the world order. An hour before dawn the next morning, we climbed into her big new car and she turned on her headlights. They lit up her garage, which was filled to the rafters with boxes and crates - all the equipment Farmer had requested for a new opthalmology clinic in Cange.</p> <p><b> As we flew back towards Haiti, via Miami, </b> Farmer worked on thank-you notes to patrons of Partners in Health. During the descent into Miami, Farmer said he had a fantasy that one day he'd look out at the skyline and at the count of 10 all the buildings erected with drug money would collapse. He glanced out the window, disappointed once again. He had other Miami rituals. Depending on its length, a layover at the airport was either 'a Miami day' or 'a Miami day plus,' and included a haircut from his favourite Cuban barber (they'd chat in Spanish) then it was up to the Admirals' Club, which he was in the habit of calling 'Amirales'. There he'd take a hot shower and then stake out a section of lounge (this was 'making a cave' or 'getting cavaceous at Amirales') and answer emails.</p> <p>He had a message from one of the staff in Cange: 'Dear Polo, we are so glad we will see you in a mere matter of hours. We miss you. We miss you as the cracked, dry earth misses the rain.'</p> <p>'After 36 hours?' Farmer said to his computer. 'Haitians, man. They're totally over the top. My kind of people.'</p> <p>Days and nights ran together. He has a small house in Cange, the closest thing in his life to a home, perched on a cliff across the road from the medical complex. It's a modified ti kay , the better sort of peasant house, with a metal roof and concrete floors, and is exceptional in that it has a bathroom, albeit without hot water. Farmer told me that he slept about five hours a night, but, many times, when I looked inside his house, his bed seemed unused. Once, he told me, 'I can't sleep. There's always somebody not getting treatment. I can't stand that.' I suppose he slept some nights. His days usually began around dawn. He'd spend an hour or so among the people who had camped out in the lower courtyard, to make sure the staff hadn't missed someone critically ill, and another hour gobbling breakfast while answering emails. Then he saw patients in his office.</p> <p>Most of the patients were indeed the poor and the maimed and the lame and the blind. For consolation, there was the man he called Lazarus, who had first arrived on a stretcher, wasted by Aids and TB to about 90lb, and now weighed 150lb. There was a healthy-looking young woman with Aids whose father, only a month before, had been saving for her coffin. But there was also a tiny old woman whose backbone had been eaten by TB bacilli, and who hobbled around with her torso at right angles to her legs. A 16-year-old boy who weighed only 60lb. ('His body has got used to starvation. We're gonna buff him up.') A lovely young woman being treated for drug-resistant TB, now in the midst of a sickle-cell crisis and moaning in pain. ('OK, doudou . OK cheri ,' Farmer cooed. He gave her morphine.) An elderly man with drug-resistant TB who was totally blind. (He'd wanted a pair of glasses anyway; Farmer had found him a pair.) He called the old women 'Mother', and the old men 'Father'. He exchanged quips with most of his patients while he examined them. He turned to me. 'It's so awful you might as well be cheerful.'</p> <p>Off and on during those two weeks in Cange, he conducted what he called 'a sorcery consult'. A woman had decided that one of her sons had 'sent' the sickness that killed another son. Farmer was trying to make peace in the family. This would probably take months, because, for one thing, it was useless to try to convince any of the parties that sorcery didn't exist.</p> <p>After office hours, he went on rounds, first to the general hospital and then, with trepidation, to the children's pavilion upstairs, where there always seemed to be a baby with the stick-like limbs, the bloated belly, the reddish hair of kwashiorkor, a form of starvation. Just two weeks earlier, on his first morning back in Cange this year, he'd lost a baby to meningitis, in its ghastly purpura fulminans presentation. And, only days later, another baby, from beyond the catchment area - within it, all children are vaccinated free - had died of tetanus. Farmer saved rounds at the TB hospital for last, because just now everyone there was getting better. Most of the patients were sitting on the beds in one of the rooms watching a soccer game on a wavy, snowy TV screen. 'Look at you bourgeois people watching TV!' Farmer said.</p> <p>Everyone laughed. One of the young men looked up at him. 'No, Dokte Paul, not bourgeois. If we were bourgeois, we would have an aerial.'</p> <p>'It cheers me up,' Farmer said on the way out. 'It's not all bad. We're failing on 71 levels, but not on one or two.' Then it was across the road to his ti kay , where he worked with a young American woman from Partners in Health who had been despatched to help him on his thank-you notes and forthcoming speeches and grant proposals. But on many nights Ti Jean, a handyman, would appear out of the dark, with news that would take Farmer back to the hospital.</p> <p>A 13-year-old girl with meningitis had arrived by donkey ambulance. The young doctors on duty hadn't done a spinal tap, to find out which type of meningitis she had, and thus which drugs to give her. 'Doctors, doctors, what is wrong with you?' Farmer said. Then he did the tap himself. Wild cries from the child: ' Li fe-m mal, mwen grangou .' Farmer looked up from his work and said, 'She's crying, \"It hurts, I'm hungry.\" Can you believe it? Only in Haiti would a child cry out that she's hungry during a spinal tap.'</p> <p><b> For a person whose CV makes one think of </b> Albert Schweitzer - the once-popular image of that person, at least - Farmer has an oddly cheerful and irreverent turn of mind. From time to time, colleagues, and even a close friend or two, have subjected him to moral envy, as if his self-abnegation were meant as a reproach to them. It isn't as though he doesn't preach self-sacrifice, but he practises more than he preaches. He has taken only two vacations in the last 12 years - the first after he was run over, in Cambridge in 1988, the second in 1997 while recovering from hepatitis A, contracted in Peru. Yet he thinks that other people ought to have vacations, and the more luxurious the better. He likes a fine meal, a good bottle of wine, a fancy hotel, and a hot shower. But he doesn't seem to need any of those things, or the money to buy others, in order to be happy.</p> <p>It was impossible to spend any time with Farmer and not wonder why he'd chosen this life. Maybe some partial explanations can be found in the usual place.</p> <p>One morning, between airplanes, he and I were standing near the side exit of a crowded bus, and he said, 'I feel at home. Our bus had doors like these.' He added, 'Until the bus turned over.' He was about 12. The bus was older. His father had bought it from the State of Alabama, had fashioned it into the Farmer residence, and parked it in a campground in Florida. The Farmers came from western Massachusetts. The whole family - Farmer's father and mother and six children - was heading home from a vacation there when the bus flipped on to its roof. No one was seriously hurt.</p> <p>'Where did you live after that?' I asked.</p> <p>'In a tent. Of course. What kind of a question is that?' He was smiling. 'This is before it got crazy, before the boat.'</p> <p>His father bought a boat, on which he intended the family to achieve full self-sufficiency. But the one time they went to sea they hauled up only a couple of edible fish, and were buffeted all night in a storm. Then his father got lost heading back for port and grazed a rock. After that, the boat stayed moored in a bayou on the Gulf Coast, north of Tampa.</p> <p>The bus door opened, and Farmer, returning to the present, looked at the door and said, 'My madeleine this morning.'</p> <p>Farmer's father had a profession - schoolteacher, usually. He was a big, vigorous man and a good athlete. He was strict with his children about manners and schoolwork and chores. But in most other respects he shunned convention, stubbornly pursuing his various schemes. 'You didn't tell him that he couldn't do something, because then he'd have to prove that he could,' Farmer's mother said. 'He was a great risk-taker, and everything always turned out all right. I mean, no one ever got seriously hurt.' He died suddenly, at the age of 49, in apparent good health, while playing basketball.</p> <p>Farmer, according to his younger sisters, was a scrawny boy, intense in anger and affection, and very smart. He started a herpetology club in fifth grade. No one came to the first meeting, but his father required his siblings to attend the family lectures about plants and animals that Paul delivered at home. He received a scholarship to Duke University. There he discovered wealth. 'How come you put your shirts in plastic?' he asked, watching his roommate unpack. At Duke, he soaked up culture. He was drama critic and art critic for the student paper. The first play he ever saw was one he was sent to review.</p> <p>But growing up on a bus and a boat, without hot showers, hardly implies a single fate. One of his sisters is a commercial artist, another manages community relations for a hospital's mental-health programme, the third is a motivational speaker. One brother is an electrician, the other a professional wrestler (known to fans as the treacherous New World Order Sting and to his family as the Gentle Giant). A person with Farmer's background might well have yearned for a lucrative suburban practice. He himself doesn't like to make too much of the connections between his present life and his childhood, which, for the most part, he remembers as happy. He did say that it had relieved him of a homing instinct. 'I never had a sense of a home town,' he said. 'It was, \"This is my campground.\" Then I got to the bottom of the barrel, and it was, \"This is my home town.\"' He meant Cange.</p> <p>Farmer told me, 'It stands to reason that a person who lives the way I do is trying to lessen some psychic discomfort.' He had wanted to avoid 'ambivalence,' he said, and had tried to build his life around 'areas of moral clarity' - 'AMCs' in Partners in Health lingo. These are areas, rare in the world, where what ought to be done seems perfectly clear. But the doing was always complicated, always difficult, in his experience. Thinking of those difficulties, I imagine that most people wouldn't willingly take them on, giving up their comforts. Yet many would like to wake up knowing what they ought to do and that they were doing it. Farmer's life looked hard, but by the time we left Haiti I also thought that it was enviable.</p> <p>Leaving Haiti, Farmer didn't stare down through the airplane window at that brown and barren third of an island. 'It bothers me even to look at it,' he explained, glancing out. 'It can't support 8m people, and there they are. There they are, kidnapped from West Africa.'</p> <p>But when we descended toward Havana he gazed out the window intently, making exclamations: 'Only 90 miles from Haiti, and look! Trees! Crops! It's all so verdant. At the height of the dry season! The same ecology as Haiti's, and look!'</p> <p>Cuba was a great relief to me. Paved roads and old American cars, instead of litters on the gwo wout la . Cuba had food rationing and allotments of coffee adulterated with ground peas, but no starvation, no enforced malnutrition. I noticed groups of prostitutes on one main road, and housing projects in need of repair and paint, like most buildings in the city. But I still had in mind the howling slums of Port-au-Prince, and Cuba looked lovely to me. What looked loveliest to Farmer was its public-health statistics.</p> <p>Many things affect a public's health, of course - nutrition and transportation, crime and housing, pest control and sanitation, as well as medicine. In Cuba, life expectancies are among the highest in the world. Diseases endemic to Haiti, such a malaria, dengue fever, TB and Aids, are rare. Cuba was training medical students gratis from all over Latin America, and exporting doctors gratis - nearly 1,000 to Haiti, two en route just now to Zanmi Lasante. In the midst of the hard times that came when the Soviet Union dissolved, the government actually increased its spending on health care. 'I can sleep here,' Farmer said when we got to our hotel. 'Everyone here has a doctor.'</p> <p>Farmer gave two talks at the conference, one on Haiti, the other on 'the noxious synergy' between HIV and TB - an active case of one often makes a latent case of the other active, too. He worked on a grand proposal to get anti-retroviral medicines for Cange, and at the conference met a woman who could help. She was in charge of the United Nations' project on Aids in the Caribbean. He lobbied her over several days. Finally, she said, 'OK, let's make it happen.' ('Can I give you a kiss?' Farmer asked. 'Can I give you two?') And an old friend, Dr Jorge P\u00e9rez, arranged a private meeting between Farmer and the secretary of Cuba's Council of State, Dr Jos\u00e9 Miyar Barruecos. Farmer asked him if he could send two youths from Cange to a Cuban medical school. 'Of course,' the secretary replied.</p> <p>Again and again during our stay, Farmer marvelled at the warmth with which the Cubans received him. What did I think accounted for this? I said I imagined they liked his connection to Harvard, his published attacks on US foreign policy in Latin America, his admiration of Cuban medicine.</p> <p>I looked up and found his pale-blue eyes fixed on me. 'I think it's because of Haiti,' he declared. 'I think it's because I serve the poor.'</p> <p>I had the impression that he was angry, disappointed, and a little hurt. An oddly potent combination. And then I felt I was forgiven. Lying in the bed next to Farmer's in the hotel room took me back to late-night talks in college and in the army. I turned out the light, and he went on talking, his voice growing slurred: 'I had a lovely day. I'm lucky. All my days are good. Not all are lovely, but they're good. I wouldn't trade with anyone.'</p> <p>A few nights later, we started flying towards Moscow. We stopped off in Paris for 18 hours, so Farmer could attend his daughter Catherine's second birthday party. He'd brought short-acting benzodiazepines to get us through the flights. They have left my memories of Paris all wrapped up in gauze. A small apartment in the Marais district, and Farmer in his black suit, dancing with his daughter, holding her to his chest, swaying from side to side in a loopy, long-limbed waltz. And the little girl's dark eyes, which her face hadn't yet grown into, fixed in serious rapture on some invisible object in the ceiling. Later, Farmer sat on the sofa and watched Catherine play with her stuffed animals. His wife, Didi, tall and stately - she probably was, in fact, the most beautiful woman in Cange - called to him from the kitchen. When did he leave for Moscow? Tomorrow morning, Farmer said. From the kitchen came the sound of something dropping and a deep-throated exclamation.</p> <p>Farmer was skipping the first meeting in Moscow to make this stop. He'd said he felt guilty about that. Now I looked over at him. He was clasping his knees with his elbows and covering his mouth with both hands. He seemed to be trying, as Haitians say, to make his body very small. I remember thinking, despite my haze, that I'd remember this. It was the first time I'd ever seen him at a loss for words or action.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/life/story/0,6903,429837,00.html\" target=\"_new\">Read the second part of 'Mission Impossible' here</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "On maps of Haiti, National Highway 3 looks like a major thoroughfare. And, indeed, it is the gwo wout la , the big- gest road across the Central Plateau, a dirt track on which trucks of various sizes, overfilled with passengers, sway in and out of giant potholes, raising clouds of dust, their engines whining in low gear. A more numerous traffic plods along on donkeys and on foot, including a procession of the sick. They are headed for the village of Cange and the medical complex called Zanmi Lasante, Creole for Partners in Health. In an all-but-treeless landscape, it stands out like a fortress on a hillside, a large collection of concrete buildings half-covered by tropical greenery. Now and then on the road, a bed moves slowly towards it, a bearer at each corner, a patient on the mattress. Zanmi Lasante is famous on the Central Plateau, in part for its medical director, Dr Paul Farmer, known as Dokte Paul, or Polo, or, occasionally, Blan Paul. The women in Zanmi Lasante's kitchen call him ti blan mwen - 'my little white guy'. Peasant farmers like to remember how, during the violent years of the coup that deposed President Aritide, the unarmed Dokte Paul faced down a soldier who tried to enter the complex carrying a gun. One peasant told me, 'God gives everyone a gift, and his gift is healing.' A former patient once declared, 'I believe he is a god.' It was also said, in whispers, 'He works with both hands' - that is, both with science and with the magic necessary to remove ensorcellments, to many Haitians the deep cause of illnesses. Most of the encomiums seem to embarrass and amuse Farmer. But this last has a painful side. The Haitian belief in illness sent by sorcery thrives on deprivation, on the long absence of effective medicine. Farmer has dozens of voodoo priests among his patients. On an evening last January, Farmer sat in his office at Zanmi Lasante, dressed in his usual Haiti clothes - black pants and a T-shirt. He was holding aloft a large white plastic bottle. It contained Indinavir, one of the new protease inhibitors for treating Aids - the kind of magic he believes in. A sad-faced young man sat in the chair beside him. Patients never sat on the other side of his desk. He seemed bound to get as close to them as possible. Farmer is an inch or two over 6ft and thin, unusually long-legged and long-armed, and he has an agile way of folding himself into a chair and arranging himself around a patient he is examining that made me think of a grasshopper. He is about 40. There is a vigorous quality about his thinness. He has a narrow face and a delicate nose, which comes almost to a point. He peered at his patient through the little round lenses of wire-rimmed glasses. The young man had Aids. Farmer had been treating him with antibacterials, but his condition had worsened. The young man said he was ashamed. 'Anybody can catch this. I told you that already,' Farmer said in Creole. He shook the bottle and the pills inside rattled. He asked the young man if he'd heard of this drug and the other new ones for Aids. The man hadn't. Well, Farmer said, the drugs didn't cure Aids, but they would take away his symptoms and, if he was lucky, let him live for many years as if he'd never caught the virus. Farmer would begin treating him soon. He had only to promise that he would never miss a dose. 'My situation is so bad,' the young man said. 'I keep injuring my head, because I'm living in such a crowded house. We have only one bed, and I let my children sleep on it, so I have to sleep under the bed, and I forget, and I hit my head when I sit up.' He went on, 'I don't forget what you did for me, Dokte Paul. When I was sick and no one would touch me, you used to sit on my bed with your hand on my head. I would like to give you a chicken or a pig.' When Farmer is relaxed, his skin is pale, with a suggestion of freckles underneath. Now it reddened instantly, from the base of his neck to his forehead. 'You've already given me a lot. Stop it!' The young man was smiling. 'I am going to sleep well tonight.' 'OK, neg pa [my man].' Farmer put the bottle of pills back in his drawer. No one else is treating impoverished Haitians with the new anti-retroviral drugs. Even some of his allies in the Haitian medical establishment think he's crazy to try. The drugs could cost as much as $18,000 a year per patient. But the fact that the poor are dying of illnesses for which effective treatments exist is, like many global facts of life, unacceptable to Farmer. Indeed, to him it is a sin. Last autumn, he gave a speech to a group in Massachusetts called Cambridge Cares About Aids and said, 'Cambridge cares about Aids, but not nearly enough.' He wondered if he'd gone too far, but afterwards, at his suggestion, healthcare workers in the audience and people with Aids collected some unused drugs, and he ended up with enough to begin triple therapy for several of his Haitian patients. He is working on grant proposals to obtain a larger, more reliable supply. He doesn't seem to think there is a chance he'll fail. In his experience, when he begs for medicines someone always comes through. Begging of one sort or another is the main way in which he and others managed to create Zanmi Lasante. They didn't borrow, but he did a little stealing - the first microscope in Cange was one he had appropriated from Harvard Medical School. Farmer has chosen to work in one of Haiti's poorest regions. About 1m peasant farmers rely on the medical complex . About 100,000 live in its catchment area - the area for which the organisation provides community-health workers. On many nights, a hundred people camp out in the courtyard beside the ambulatory clinic; by morning, 300, sometimes more, are waiting for treatment. Unlike almost every other hospital in Haiti, Zanmi Lasante charges only nominal fees, and women and children and the seriously ill pay nothing. Partners in Health pays the bills, which are remarkably small. (Farmer spends about $200 to cure an uncomplicated case of tuberculosis in Haiti. The same cure in the US costs up to $20,000). Sometimes the pharmacy muddles a prescription or runs out of a drug. Now and then, the lab technicians lose a specimen. Seven doctors work at the complex, not all of them fully competent. But Zanmi Lasante has built schools and communal water systems for most of the villages in its catchment area. A few years back, when Haiti suffered an outbreak of typhoid resistant to the drugs usually used to treat it, Partners in Health imported an effective but expensive antibiotic, cleaned up the water supply, and stopped the outbreak in the Central Plateau. The medical complex has launched programmes in its catchment area for both the prevention and the treatment of Aids, and has reduced the vertical transmission rate (from mothers to babies) to 4 per cent. In Haiti, TB kills more adults than any other disease, but no one from the catchment area has died from it since 1988. Farmer now has these titles, among others: associate professor in two different departments at Harvard Medical School; member of the senior staff in Infectious Disease at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston; chief consultant on tuberculosis in Russian prisons for the World Bank (unpaid, at his insistence - he deplores some of the World Bank's policies); and founding director of Partners in Health. In 1993, the MacArthur Foundation gave Farmer one of its so-called genius grants. He had the entire sum sent to Partners in Health - in this case, some $220,000. During his medical-school years, Farmer camped out in Roxbury, in a garret in the rectory of St Mary of the Angels. Later, during sojourns in Boston, he stayed in the basement of Partners in Health headquarters, and he went on staying there after he got married - to Didi Bertrand, the daughter of the schoolmaster in Cange, and 'the most beautiful woman in Cange', people at Zanmi Lasante say. When a daughter was born, two years ago, Farmer saw no reason to change their Boston digs, but his wife did. Now they have an apartment at Harvard. He never sees his paychecks from Harvard and the Brigham. The bookkeeper at Partners in Health cashes them, pays his family's bills, and puts the rest away in the treasury. One day not long ago, Farmer tried to use his credit card and was told he'd reached his limit, so he called the bookkeeper. She told him, 'Honey, you are the hardest-working broke man I know.' By any standard, Farmer's life is complicated. Didi, who is 31, and their daughter spend the academic year in Paris, where Didi is finishing her own studies in anthropology. Several friends have told Farmer that he should visit his family more often. 'But I don't have any patients in Paris,' he says forlornly. In theory, he works four months in Boston and the rest of the year in Haiti. In fact, those periods are all chopped up. Years ago, he got a letter from American Airlines welcoming him to its million-mile club. He has travelled at least 2m miles since. I spent a month with Farmer: a little more than two weeks in Haiti, with a short trip to South Carolina wedged in; five days in Cuba, at a conference on Aids; and the rest in Moscow, on TB business. He called this 'a light month for travel'. It had a certain roundness. A church group was, in effect, paying for his flight to South Carolina; the Cuban government covered his travel to Havana; and the Soros Foundation financed his trip to Moscow. 'Capitalists, Commies, and Jesus Christers are paying,' he said. When Paul Farmer goes on a long trip, he carries medicines and carrousels of slides and gifts of Haitian art for his hosts, and ends up with room for only three shirts. He owns one suit, which is black, so that he can, for example, wipe the fuzz off the tip of his pen on his trouser leg while writing up orders at the Brigham, catch a night flight to Lima or Moscow, and still look presentable when he arrives. En route to South Carolina, the zip on his trousers came apart. 'Oh well, I'll button my coat,' he said before his speech. He addressed a meeting of the Anderson County Medical Society. Some of its members visit Cange every year to treat patients free. Some in this particular audience were also church people - the Episcopal Diocese of Upper South Carolina has been making donations to Zanmi Lasante for almost two decades. It was a jacket-and-tie crowd. Farmer gave them his Haiti talk, a compendium of harsh statistics and cheerful photographs that showed what contributions from places such as South Carolina could do. Here was a photograph of a girl who had come to Zanmi Lasante with extra- pulmonary TB. She was bald, her limbs were wasted. And here was the same girl, with a full head of hair and chubby cheeks, smiling at the camera. Cries of surprise from the crowd, followed by applause. No matter who the audience, that pair of photographs always had the same effect. Farmer had felt jubilant, too, when he treated the girl, but the fact was that the 'before' picture more nearly represented the Haitian norm. When the applause died away, Farmer grinned. 'It's almost as if she had a treatable infectious disease.' Farmer likes to say that he and his colleagues will make common cause with anyone who is sincerely trying to change the 'political economies' of countries such as Haiti. In the meantime, though, the poor are suffering. They are 'dying like smelt', as Farmer puts it. 'He always kind of holds your feet to the fire,' the MC said when Farmer was done, and, indeed, the applause sounded only slightly more than polite. Like much of the audience, Farmer is himself religious. He subscribes to the Catholic doctrine called liberation theology, and to its central imperative - to provide 'a preferential option for the poor'. But, he told me, 'I hang on to my Catholicism by a tiny thread. I'm still looking for something in the sacred texts that prohibits using condoms.' Some of his beliefs, ones he hadn't openly expressed that night - for example, 'I think there should be a massive redistribution of wealth to places like Haiti' - would have seemed extreme to this sedate audience. Yet he liked these people a great deal. Farmer's politics are complex. He has problems with groups that on the surface would seem to be allies. With, for example, what he calls 'WLs' - 'white liberals', some of whose most influential spokespeople are black. 'I love WLs, love 'em to death. They're on our side,' Farmer once said, 'But WLs think all the world's problems can be fixed without any cost to themselves. We don't believe that. There's a lot to be said for sacrifice, remorse, even pity. It's what separates us from roaches.' As often as not, he prefers religious groups and what he calls 'church ladies'. We stayed at the house of a church lady that night, an impeccably genteel Southerner. She lived in a retirement community. When we arrived, one of her neighbours, a retired dentist, was repainting the movable flags on all the residents' mailboxes. Of our hostess, Farmer had said, 'She is a very good person. I'll take her over a Harvard smart-ass any day. I love her, actually.' I was a little puzzled. This woman wasn't a person you'd suspect of threatening the world order. An hour before dawn the next morning, we climbed into her big new car and she turned on her headlights. They lit up her garage, which was filled to the rafters with boxes and crates - all the equipment Farmer had requested for a new opthalmology clinic in Cange. As we flew back towards Haiti, via Miami, Farmer worked on thank-you notes to patrons of Partners in Health. During the descent into Miami, Farmer said he had a fantasy that one day he'd look out at the skyline and at the count of 10 all the buildings erected with drug money would collapse. He glanced out the window, disappointed once again. He had other Miami rituals. Depending on its length, a layover at the airport was either 'a Miami day' or 'a Miami day plus,' and included a haircut from his favourite Cuban barber (they'd chat in Spanish) then it was up to the Admirals' Club, which he was in the habit of calling 'Amirales'. There he'd take a hot shower and then stake out a section of lounge (this was 'making a cave' or 'getting cavaceous at Amirales') and answer emails. He had a message from one of the staff in Cange: 'Dear Polo, we are so glad we will see you in a mere matter of hours. We miss you. We miss you as the cracked, dry earth misses the rain.' 'After 36 hours?' Farmer said to his computer. 'Haitians, man. They're totally over the top. My kind of people.' Days and nights ran together. He has a small house in Cange, the closest thing in his life to a home, perched on a cliff across the road from the medical complex. It's a modified ti kay , the better sort of peasant house, with a metal roof and concrete floors, and is exceptional in that it has a bathroom, albeit without hot water. Farmer told me that he slept about five hours a night, but, many times, when I looked inside his house, his bed seemed unused. Once, he told me, 'I can't sleep. There's always somebody not getting treatment. I can't stand that.' I suppose he slept some nights. His days usually began around dawn. He'd spend an hour or so among the people who had camped out in the lower courtyard, to make sure the staff hadn't missed someone critically ill, and another hour gobbling breakfast while answering emails. Then he saw patients in his office. Most of the patients were indeed the poor and the maimed and the lame and the blind. For consolation, there was the man he called Lazarus, who had first arrived on a stretcher, wasted by Aids and TB to about 90lb, and now weighed 150lb. There was a healthy-looking young woman with Aids whose father, only a month before, had been saving for her coffin. But there was also a tiny old woman whose backbone had been eaten by TB bacilli, and who hobbled around with her torso at right angles to her legs. A 16-year-old boy who weighed only 60lb. ('His body has got used to starvation. We're gonna buff him up.') A lovely young woman being treated for drug-resistant TB, now in the midst of a sickle-cell crisis and moaning in pain. ('OK, doudou . OK cheri ,' Farmer cooed. He gave her morphine.) An elderly man with drug-resistant TB who was totally blind. (He'd wanted a pair of glasses anyway; Farmer had found him a pair.) He called the old women 'Mother', and the old men 'Father'. He exchanged quips with most of his patients while he examined them. He turned to me. 'It's so awful you might as well be cheerful.' Off and on during those two weeks in Cange, he conducted what he called 'a sorcery consult'. A woman had decided that one of her sons had 'sent' the sickness that killed another son. Farmer was trying to make peace in the family. This would probably take months, because, for one thing, it was useless to try to convince any of the parties that sorcery didn't exist. After office hours, he went on rounds, first to the general hospital and then, with trepidation, to the children's pavilion upstairs, where there always seemed to be a baby with the stick-like limbs, the bloated belly, the reddish hair of kwashiorkor, a form of starvation. Just two weeks earlier, on his first morning back in Cange this year, he'd lost a baby to meningitis, in its ghastly purpura fulminans presentation. And, only days later, another baby, from beyond the catchment area - within it, all children are vaccinated free - had died of tetanus. Farmer saved rounds at the TB hospital for last, because just now everyone there was getting better. Most of the patients were sitting on the beds in one of the rooms watching a soccer game on a wavy, snowy TV screen. 'Look at you bourgeois people watching TV!' Farmer said. Everyone laughed. One of the young men looked up at him. 'No, Dokte Paul, not bourgeois. If we were bourgeois, we would have an aerial.' 'It cheers me up,' Farmer said on the way out. 'It's not all bad. We're failing on 71 levels, but not on one or two.' Then it was across the road to his ti kay , where he worked with a young American woman from Partners in Health who had been despatched to help him on his thank-you notes and forthcoming speeches and grant proposals. But on many nights Ti Jean, a handyman, would appear out of the dark, with news that would take Farmer back to the hospital. A 13-year-old girl with meningitis had arrived by donkey ambulance. The young doctors on duty hadn't done a spinal tap, to find out which type of meningitis she had, and thus which drugs to give her. 'Doctors, doctors, what is wrong with you?' Farmer said. Then he did the tap himself. Wild cries from the child: ' Li fe-m mal, mwen grangou .' Farmer looked up from his work and said, 'She's crying, \"It hurts, I'm hungry.\" Can you believe it? Only in Haiti would a child cry out that she's hungry during a spinal tap.' For a person whose CV makes one think of Albert Schweitzer - the once-popular image of that person, at least - Farmer has an oddly cheerful and irreverent turn of mind. From time to time, colleagues, and even a close friend or two, have subjected him to moral envy, as if his self-abnegation were meant as a reproach to them. It isn't as though he doesn't preach self-sacrifice, but he practises more than he preaches. He has taken only two vacations in the last 12 years - the first after he was run over, in Cambridge in 1988, the second in 1997 while recovering from hepatitis A, contracted in Peru. Yet he thinks that other people ought to have vacations, and the more luxurious the better. He likes a fine meal, a good bottle of wine, a fancy hotel, and a hot shower. But he doesn't seem to need any of those things, or the money to buy others, in order to be happy. It was impossible to spend any time with Farmer and not wonder why he'd chosen this life. Maybe some partial explanations can be found in the usual place. One morning, between airplanes, he and I were standing near the side exit of a crowded bus, and he said, 'I feel at home. Our bus had doors like these.' He added, 'Until the bus turned over.' He was about 12. The bus was older. His father had bought it from the State of Alabama, had fashioned it into the Farmer residence, and parked it in a campground in Florida. The Farmers came from western Massachusetts. The whole family - Farmer's father and mother and six children - was heading home from a vacation there when the bus flipped on to its roof. No one was seriously hurt. 'Where did you live after that?' I asked. 'In a tent. Of course. What kind of a question is that?' He was smiling. 'This is before it got crazy, before the boat.' His father bought a boat, on which he intended the family to achieve full self-sufficiency. But the one time they went to sea they hauled up only a couple of edible fish, and were buffeted all night in a storm. Then his father got lost heading back for port and grazed a rock. After that, the boat stayed moored in a bayou on the Gulf Coast, north of Tampa. The bus door opened, and Farmer, returning to the present, looked at the door and said, 'My madeleine this morning.' Farmer's father had a profession - schoolteacher, usually. He was a big, vigorous man and a good athlete. He was strict with his children about manners and schoolwork and chores. But in most other respects he shunned convention, stubbornly pursuing his various schemes. 'You didn't tell him that he couldn't do something, because then he'd have to prove that he could,' Farmer's mother said. 'He was a great risk-taker, and everything always turned out all right. I mean, no one ever got seriously hurt.' He died suddenly, at the age of 49, in apparent good health, while playing basketball. Farmer, according to his younger sisters, was a scrawny boy, intense in anger and affection, and very smart. He started a herpetology club in fifth grade. No one came to the first meeting, but his father required his siblings to attend the family lectures about plants and animals that Paul delivered at home. He received a scholarship to Duke University. There he discovered wealth. 'How come you put your shirts in plastic?' he asked, watching his roommate unpack. At Duke, he soaked up culture. He was drama critic and art critic for the student paper. The first play he ever saw was one he was sent to review. But growing up on a bus and a boat, without hot showers, hardly implies a single fate. One of his sisters is a commercial artist, another manages community relations for a hospital's mental-health programme, the third is a motivational speaker. One brother is an electrician, the other a professional wrestler (known to fans as the treacherous New World Order Sting and to his family as the Gentle Giant). A person with Farmer's background might well have yearned for a lucrative suburban practice. He himself doesn't like to make too much of the connections between his present life and his childhood, which, for the most part, he remembers as happy. He did say that it had relieved him of a homing instinct. 'I never had a sense of a home town,' he said. 'It was, \"This is my campground.\" Then I got to the bottom of the barrel, and it was, \"This is my home town.\"' He meant Cange. Farmer told me, 'It stands to reason that a person who lives the way I do is trying to lessen some psychic discomfort.' He had wanted to avoid 'ambivalence,' he said, and had tried to build his life around 'areas of moral clarity' - 'AMCs' in Partners in Health lingo. These are areas, rare in the world, where what ought to be done seems perfectly clear. But the doing was always complicated, always difficult, in his experience. Thinking of those difficulties, I imagine that most people wouldn't willingly take them on, giving up their comforts. Yet many would like to wake up knowing what they ought to do and that they were doing it. Farmer's life looked hard, but by the time we left Haiti I also thought that it was enviable. Leaving Haiti, Farmer didn't stare down through the airplane window at that brown and barren third of an island. 'It bothers me even to look at it,' he explained, glancing out. 'It can't support 8m people, and there they are. There they are, kidnapped from West Africa.' But when we descended toward Havana he gazed out the window intently, making exclamations: 'Only 90 miles from Haiti, and look! Trees! Crops! It's all so verdant. At the height of the dry season! The same ecology as Haiti's, and look!' Cuba was a great relief to me. Paved roads and old American cars, instead of litters on the gwo wout la . Cuba had food rationing and allotments of coffee adulterated with ground peas, but no starvation, no enforced malnutrition. I noticed groups of prostitutes on one main road, and housing projects in need of repair and paint, like most buildings in the city. But I still had in mind the howling slums of Port-au-Prince, and Cuba looked lovely to me. What looked loveliest to Farmer was its public-health statistics. Many things affect a public's health, of course - nutrition and transportation, crime and housing, pest control and sanitation, as well as medicine. In Cuba, life expectancies are among the highest in the world. Diseases endemic to Haiti, such a malaria, dengue fever, TB and Aids, are rare. Cuba was training medical students gratis from all over Latin America, and exporting doctors gratis - nearly 1,000 to Haiti, two en route just now to Zanmi Lasante. In the midst of the hard times that came when the Soviet Union dissolved, the government actually increased its spending on health care. 'I can sleep here,' Farmer said when we got to our hotel. 'Everyone here has a doctor.' Farmer gave two talks at the conference, one on Haiti, the other on 'the noxious synergy' between HIV and TB - an active case of one often makes a latent case of the other active, too. He worked on a grand proposal to get anti-retroviral medicines for Cange, and at the conference met a woman who could help. She was in charge of the United Nations' project on Aids in the Caribbean. He lobbied her over several days. Finally, she said, 'OK, let's make it happen.' ('Can I give you a kiss?' Farmer asked. 'Can I give you two?') And an old friend, Dr Jorge P\u00e9rez, arranged a private meeting between Farmer and the secretary of Cuba's Council of State, Dr Jos\u00e9 Miyar Barruecos. Farmer asked him if he could send two youths from Cange to a Cuban medical school. 'Of course,' the secretary replied. Again and again during our stay, Farmer marvelled at the warmth with which the Cubans received him. What did I think accounted for this? I said I imagined they liked his connection to Harvard, his published attacks on US foreign policy in Latin America, his admiration of Cuban medicine. I looked up and found his pale-blue eyes fixed on me. 'I think it's because of Haiti,' he declared. 'I think it's because I serve the poor.' I had the impression that he was angry, disappointed, and a little hurt. An oddly potent combination. And then I felt I was forgiven. Lying in the bed next to Farmer's in the hotel room took me back to late-night talks in college and in the army. I turned out the light, and he went on talking, his voice growing slurred: 'I had a lovely day. I'm lucky. All my days are good. Not all are lovely, but they're good. I wouldn't trade with anyone.' A few nights later, we started flying towards Moscow. We stopped off in Paris for 18 hours, so Farmer could attend his daughter Catherine's second birthday party. He'd brought short-acting benzodiazepines to get us through the flights. They have left my memories of Paris all wrapped up in gauze. A small apartment in the Marais district, and Farmer in his black suit, dancing with his daughter, holding her to his chest, swaying from side to side in a loopy, long-limbed waltz. And the little girl's dark eyes, which her face hadn't yet grown into, fixed in serious rapture on some invisible object in the ceiling. Later, Farmer sat on the sofa and watched Catherine play with her stuffed animals. His wife, Didi, tall and stately - she probably was, in fact, the most beautiful woman in Cange - called to him from the kitchen. When did he leave for Moscow? Tomorrow morning, Farmer said. From the kitchen came the sound of something dropping and a deep-throated exclamation. Farmer was skipping the first meeting in Moscow to make this stop. He'd said he felt guilty about that. Now I looked over at him. He was clasping his knees with his elbows and covering his mouth with both hands. He seemed to be trying, as Haitians say, to make his body very small. I remember thinking, despite my haze, that I'd remember this. It was the first time I'd ever seen him at a loss for words or action. Read the second part of 'Mission Impossible' here",

Well, the Son of Stars Wars for a start, the missile protection programme that won't happen unless we allow our Fylingdales satellite station to be upgraded. (In return for which we get precisely no protective coverage at all.)</p> <p>It does not take an evil genius, or even a moderately astute terrorist with his grade one in Elementary Terrorism, to work out that if you take Britain (unprotected, remember) out of the equation, the US will be back to square one, with Dubya at the controls. Now, where are those nuclear shelter blueprints?</p> <p>In the early 80s, the Home Office prepared a guide to domestic nuclear shelters. There were three options: the improvised garden shelter, the manufactured outdoor shelter and the one we are interested in, the underground, reinforced concrete bunker.</p> <p>Extensive calculations reveal that for a floor area of 10 sq m and walls of 1m thickness, you will need 46m of concrete for the walls and 98m for the floor and ceiling. With 10 25kg bags of cement making up 1m of concrete, you are looking at 1,440 bags at \u00a32.68 each. A second-hand excavator will cost about \u00a320,000 but you could just hire it. Your bunker will, hopefully, withstand a one megaton blast two miles away. But it won't have a bathroom and you'll need ventilation equipment and a small generator (\u00a3795).</p> <p>Don't forget torches, since open flames are not a good idea inside your shelter and it will be pretty cloudy outside for, oh, a year or two. A cheap radio is also wise. A pre-Armageddon shopping list might include tinned fruit, baked beans and tuna, longlife milk and cereals.

Well, the Son of Stars Wars for a start, the missile protection programme that won't happen unless we allow our Fylingdales satellite station to be upgraded. (In return for which we get precisely no protective coverage at all.) It does not take an evil genius, or even a moderately astute terrorist with his grade one in Elementary Terrorism, to work out that if you take Britain (unprotected, remember) out of the equation, the US will be back to square one, with Dubya at the controls. Now, where are those nuclear shelter blueprints? In the early 80s, the Home Office prepared a guide to domestic nuclear shelters. There were three options: the improvised garden shelter, the manufactured outdoor shelter and the one we are interested in, the underground, reinforced concrete bunker. Extensive calculations reveal that for a floor area of 10 sq m and walls of 1m thickness, you will need 46m of concrete for the walls and 98m for the floor and ceiling. With 10 25kg bags of cement making up 1m of concrete, you are looking at 1,440 bags at \u00a32.68 each. A second-hand excavator will cost about \u00a320,000 but you could just hire it. Your bunker will, hopefully, withstand a one megaton blast two miles away. But it won't have a bathroom and you'll need ventilation equipment and a small generator (\u00a3795). Don't forget torches, since open flames are not a good idea inside your shelter and it will be pretty cloudy outside for, oh, a year or two. A cheap radio is also wise. A pre-Armageddon shopping list might include tinned fruit, baked beans and tuna, longlife milk and cereals. You should drink at least a litre of water per day (90p per bottle). Two days after a nuclear attack, radiation levels will have dropped to one-hundredth of their original intensity.

      "body": "<p><strong> City Racing 1988-98: a Partial Account </strong></p> <p> ICA, London SW1, until 11 March </p> <p> City racing was once a knackered old betting shop in south London, so close to the Oval that you could hear the crowd applaud on a warm summer day. The shop was in a row of condemned buildings, hard by a gasworks and a bleak corner pub. Even when five artists turned it into a gallery in 1988, it didn't exactly glamorise the area. </p> <p>For several years, with and without funds, these artists ran intermittent shows. Then along came a Pizza Express, a video shop, even a ritzy French restaurant, by which time City Racing had disappeared. Perhaps you heard of it, perhaps you didn't, but 10-1 you never went there. </p> <p>This is not intended as any kind of snub, although it's true that City Racing hardly clamoured for attention. Its shows generally ran for days, rather than weeks, and it seemed to be open only at weekends. In this respect, it was very much like all the other short-lived galleries that still come and go in south London, dragonflies to Tate Modern's rock of ages. The point about City Racing was that it showed a lot of young artists before they became famous, along with many who never would, and quite a number of their international counterparts. Moreover, it kept this up for a full 10 artist-run years. </p> <p>Still, you may say, not much to brag about - the same thing was happening all over Britain. Ever since Damien Hirst curated the Freeze show, also in 1988, empty warehouses, garages, offices and tower blocks were constantly commandeered by artists, who made ever larger and emptier propositions in these concrete acres. It was very much like watching the history of the Edinburgh Fringe all over again, the race to requisition disused ice-rinks and parking-lots, to get some aura from ex-industrial locations, some charge from the context that the performance itself could hardly supply. </p> <p>City Racing was too small for the big time, it couldn't manage massive installations or videos on cinema-sized screens. Part of the pleasure of <strong> City Racing 1988-98 </strong> at the ICA, a handy crib of works from a decade of shows, is that it isn't remotely spectacular. It feels quite homely, with its clutter of paintings, drawings, photos and videos on tellies. There's the old shop sign, the old arsenical green paint, the loose wires and the filthy canvases.

      "bodyText": "City Racing 1988-98: a Partial Account ICA, London SW1, until 11 March City racing was once a knackered old betting shop in south London, so close to the Oval that you could hear the crowd applaud on a warm summer day. The shop was in a row of condemned buildings, hard by a gasworks and a bleak corner pub. Even when five artists turned it into a gallery in 1988, it didn't exactly glamorise the area. For several years, with and without funds, these artists ran intermittent shows. Then along came a Pizza Express, a video shop, even a ritzy French restaurant, by which time City Racing had disappeared. Perhaps you heard of it, perhaps you didn't, but 10-1 you never went there. This is not intended as any kind of snub, although it's true that City Racing hardly clamoured for attention. Its shows generally ran for days, rather than weeks, and it seemed to be open only at weekends. In this respect, it was very much like all the other short-lived galleries that still come and go in south London, dragonflies to Tate Modern's rock of ages. The point about City Racing was that it showed a lot of young artists before they became famous, along with many who never would, and quite a number of their international counterparts. Moreover, it kept this up for a full 10 artist-run years. Still, you may say, not much to brag about - the same thing was happening all over Britain. Ever since Damien Hirst curated the Freeze show, also in 1988, empty warehouses, garages, offices and tower blocks were constantly commandeered by artists, who made ever larger and emptier propositions in these concrete acres. It was very much like watching the history of the Edinburgh Fringe all over again, the race to requisition disused ice-rinks and parking-lots, to get some aura from ex-industrial locations, some charge from the context that the performance itself could hardly supply. City Racing was too small for the big time, it couldn't manage massive installations or videos on cinema-sized screens. Part of the pleasure of City Racing 1988-98 at the ICA, a handy crib of works from a decade of shows, is that it isn't remotely spectacular. It feels quite homely, with its clutter of paintings, drawings, photos and videos on tellies. There's the old shop sign, the old arsenical green paint, the loose wires and the filthy canvases. Unless they've cleaned the place up by the time the show opens - I saw it in the earliest stages - it won't seem at all pristine and ultra-brite, not a bit like the Saatchi Gallery. Which is where some of these artists fetched up. Sarah Lucas, who had her first solo exhibition at City Racing in 1991, is showing a couple of her customised Sunday Sport covers, which still live as violent tabloid satire. Bryan Cyril Griffiths has his Nasa-like machines, high-tech equipment made, with laborious bathos, out of Blue Peter bottle tops, glue and cardboard. Mark Hosking offers a water pump made from an exercise bike and some tubing, a piece of rudimentary agrarian equipment based, with not much sensitivity, on those UN manuals for drought-stricken countries. There are early photographs by Gillian Wearing, one of Fiona Banner's outstandingly boring transcriptions of some scenes from Lawrence of Arabia and a video by Mark Wallinger, in which Tommy Cooper tries on a series of funny hats. The tape runs backwards, yet the audience still seems to laugh in all the right places (of course): a running gag on the good old running gags of British humour. Wallinger recently published a fine diatribe against the 'stunt' art of the warehouse Nineties. 'In hot-wiring straight to the moneyed and influential,' he wrote, 'the need for a discerning public was successfully avoided.' He could hardly have been thinking of the old betting shop, which was scarcely anyone's route to success.

To Nosferatu and Gail from Coronation Street. I quite like Marilyn Manson's look - I call it 'Undead Versace' - but you might have other ideas. Ideas which involve screaming, and hugging your edition of the Carpenters' Greatest Hits for comfort. </p> <p>Indeed, observing Manson (Brian Warner to his mum) wading around the stage on his signature stilts, one is reminded that he is probably one of the first pop stars to endeavour to make the least of himself. On purpose, that is. He's not trying to be controversial or anything. Ugliness - his, yours, everybody's, but in particular that of the society which spawned him - just happens to be Manson's main gig. </p> <p>Over here, in Britain, Manson is just that strange, trouble-making, devil-worshipping bloke from America, who admits to taking a big girly interest in tarot cards, and should stop wearing make-up and get himself a decent hair cut. He sounds sort of OK (if you like heavy metal done heavier, with a lot of scalded-cat screeching thrown in over the top), and his ideas are entertaining, albeit somewhat Yank-centric (we haven't got a gun culture, but we're happy to pretend we have if it means we can join in) and unsubtly done (not even Manson could pretend his infamous video featuring the JFK motorcade wasn't designed to gratuitously offend). However, it's not like Manson is in danger of usurping Eminem as our favourite controversial musical import. </p> <p>Over in America things are very different. Manson's white-faced gruesomeness, coupled with his rebellion against religious-political conservatism and sneering contempt for mass media and gun culture, have turned him into a multi-million-selling Bad Boy Incarnate. He is the poster boy for the youthful, alienated American masses, mainly aged between 15 and 15, who really dig those pops he has at God-botherers and trigger-happy right-wingers. In short, in the US, Manson represents everything that is decadent, evil and anti-American. A drug-spiked apple pie smashing straight into Uncle Sam's beloved face. </p> <p>Which is probably how it came to pass that Manson was blamed for inspiring the Columbine massacre in Colorado, where two boys killed 12 classmates and a teacher. Somebody apart from the government had to take the rap, and Judas Priest were nowhere to be found. </p> <p>Here in Docklands, the crowd are a bit more mixed than you'd expect - hippie long-hairs and beer boys mingling incongruously with the scrum of painted, pouty Manson faithful, who teeter by on high heels in a stinking cloud of perfume, presumably entitled Eau de Misunderstood. That's just the boys, of course. The girls keep it toned down, wearing only 70 pairs of fishnets at once. On their arms. The chicks also seem to favour those corsets which pinch you in at the waist in so violent a manner that your buttocks become part of your breasts, and you get a nose bleed on escalators. One girl walks around in one of these contraptions, breathing like an old concertina. </p> <p>Another guy is wearing his studded leather trousers so inappropriately tight that one becomes worried for his future virility. Clearly, a fan doesn't have to go moshing to sustain an injury at a Manson gig - it's enough just to turn up. </p> <p>Once Manson kicks into his set, the place erupts into a state of mincing frenzy. The set is a well-paced mix of the 1996 crossover album Antichrist Superstar, the 1998 follow-up Mechanical Animals and this year's Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death). The songs, bellicose stews of superannuated goth, headbutt rock and wriggle-bottom metal, sound passable (if you enjoy the sensation of small planets landing on your head and exploding). Sadly, the alienated, impassioned, beautifully fashioned lyrics (a Manson strong point) cannot be heard for love or money. 'WeerrWahhWooo,' he seems to be singing to every song, except for when he's going: 'WooWahhh Werrr!' </p> <p>Clearly it's going to be a long night. Manson obliges the people who think he is Satan by simulating masturbation and abusing a fan onstage - maybe it's written into his contract that he has to these days - and making rude satanic gestures that nobody who lives outside of Salem could ever understand. </p> <p>Then, to my delight, he plays 'The Nobodies', his response to the Columbine tragedy. This staggering, passionate poem to America, performed acoustically as an extra track on Holy Wood, convinced me that he might just be a genius waiting for a tune. Tonight, however, Manson turns the drums up loud, launches into the song with all the subtlety of a snowplough, and it's all 'WerrWahhWoo' again. Still, at least everyone gets to feel slightly dangerous. </p> <p>Which is probably the point. Watching Manson prowling around the stage like some skinny, long-lost cousin of the Tellytubbies, making a big row and attempting to incite the crowd into swearing at the Queen (ooh, careful), it all suddenly seemed very sad, overblown and infantile. And irrefutably American. </p> <p>After all, Manson has two great strengths - his lyrics and his sense of theatre. Once you can't hear the former, and the latter turns into a cuddly pantomime, the very point of him seems all but lost.</p>",

Even the monthly bulletin of events produced by SPNM (Society for the Promotion of New Music) had no oases of the new. Things may get worse. The news that performance royalties, imposed by the Performing Rights Society, are to rise steeply will make it harder than ever for promoters to programme new works. This comes on top of the recent reduction in the Classical Music Subsidy. Large festivals like the Proms might just manage to absorb these costs. Smaller ones, the nerve centres of new music in Britain, will be driven to the wall. The usual suspects will benefit at the expense of their younger would be successors. Reports of the demise of the classical music business tend to be wildly exaggerated. But this is not music as business. It is music itself.",

      "body": "<p>Advertising now is among the most important media of the advanced world. One of its best theorists, the Australian Paulie Boutlis, calls it 'the very public conscience of the new society', and says that any residual guilt felt by admen and women over their profession should be cast aside, because both the creators of advertising and its audience are complicit in an 'open, diffuse and indeterminate' universe. One of its most successful practitioners, Al Young, the senior creative director at the St Luke's agency, says that advertising is 'social messages', that he and his colleagues are 'trying to give a purpose to the brands' they advertise. Both agree, however, that the prime purpose is to grab attention; it is simply that attention-grabbing techniques have changed significantly. They have done so in two particular ways: first, in enlisting pornography; second, in enlisting social conscience.</p> <p>Over the past year, billboards have carried a number of campaigns showing women, naked or barely clothed, with their legs spread, apparently about to masturbate, or waiting for a man to lick them or enter them. One of the ads, for Gossard, showed a woman in hazy mid-shot, on a bed, her head flung back as if in ecstasy, with the line 'Put him on his knees'. The single entendre was that she was enjoying cunnilingus. A campaign for Versace - which appears even in magazines such as Time - shows a blonde woman in a bedroom, wearing little more than a (presumably Versace) black suspender belt and stockings - the classic outfit for soft porn. In one ad, she lies, as in post-coital sleep, next to a fully clothed man. In another, she lies on a bed, her hand poised pre-masturbatorily above her crotch, just covered by a robe.</p> <p>On London buses, Folke, the clothing company, features women with their legs open, looking expectantly towards the viewer in the car behind. Anna Friel, a TV star in a low-cut gown, invites customers to 'come to bed' on a reclining seat of Virgin Atlantic's Upper Class service. A magazine ad for Total Spectrum ('creative packaging solutions') shows a large penis encased in white underpants, with the line: 'So you've got a great product'. And everywhere, French Connection UK plasters its acronym, FCUK, with the transparent intent of equating its products with the Anglo-Saxon for copulation, now also the most common oath in English speech.</p> <p>The ad on which attention focused was one for Yves St Laurent's Opium brand of perfume. This featured the model Sophie Dahl, her skin marble white, lying on black satin sheets and wearing only a diamond choker and bracelet, and a pair of gold sandals. Her legs were spread: one hand caressed a breast, her eyes were closed, her lips open. The pose was one that a thousand directors of hotel-room soft porn had instructed their stars to adopt. It appeared in such magazines as Vogue last autumn - but, taking its place among the underwear ads that had long been flicking lightly at the edges of porn style, it flourished undisturbed. On 48-sheeters (as advertising people call their big posters), it was a different story - especially since BMP, Yves St Laurent's agency, put them up in such provocative sites as outside the Welsh Assembly, one of the very few western legislatures outside the US where the members might be expected to be overtly God-fearing. Sure enough, one such member, Plaid Cymru's Brian Hancock, complained to the Advertising Standards Authority.</p> <p>He and 729 others. The ad attracted more opposition than anything since the Pope had been photo-montaged into a crash helmet to promote safe sex five years ago. It was deemed to be causing 'serious or widespread offence', and the order came for it to be taken down. But the resulting media coverage and reproduction of the image has been beyond anything that the advertisers could have bought.</p> <p>Al Young of the agency St Luke's is candid about the mechanism now in play. However, it is not always about sex. One of the most successful of the St Luke's campaigns has been for the Swedish furniture store Ikea, featuring authoritarian Swedish managers bossing about clueless English staff. One ad abjured TV viewers to 'Chuck out the chintz' - that is, get rid of awful English furniture and buy smart Swedish stuff. A preview copy was sent to Peter Hitchens, then a Daily Express columnist - because, Young and his colleagues knew, the English nationalist Hitchens could be counted on to rail against it. On cue, he did so; and on that cue, the Guardian counter-railed against his railings.</p> <p>In the past month, Young has been on Radio 4's Today programme to defend another Ikea ad, this time in the Sun , which showed a tough Swedish manager locking his English subordinates in a room for 12 days to show them what waiting for a piece of furniture for that long is like (an Ikea selling-point is that customers pick up what they buy and take it home right away). This, says Young, was a triumph for his client, which spends only about one-fifth of other furniture stores' media budgets.</p> <p>'Everything now is in oversupply,' says Young. 'So the ads have to work very hard. Which means they have to get into spaces other than those bought for them.' In other words, what will play in the news media is now at least as important as the ads themselves.</p> <p>Sex has become more explicit in ads because it has become so in the media - most vividly, over Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky. Oral sex and masturbation were given the platform of the Oval Office, and thus entered every media outlet from the New York Times to Pravda via the Lady. As Paul Begala, a former Clinton adviser, put it, the media now are 'not liberal leaning but scandal leaning', giving sexual explicitness the respectable coating of investigative journalism. At the same time, the porn industry has billowed: 30 years ago, the industry was worth between $5m and $10m; now it is worth $10bn in the US alone, much more than the value of Hollywood's output. It is also now moving to a level of explicitness and experimentation previously unplumbed (metaphor intended). In Talk magazine, the novelist Martin Amis reports that the present trend is towards 'anals', sometimes 'DP', ie, anal and vaginal penetration simultaneously - or beyond that, 'double' or 'triple anals'.</p> <p>With such images circling the earth or humming down the cables, an actress miming masturbation hardly counts as interesting - until the uncools start complaining and a nice little media storm erupts. Then everyone is happy - the uncools, who get something banned; the media people, who get far more space than they paid for; and the client, who gets the product excitingly identified with bad-girl or bad-boy-ness.</p> <p>But the second advertising trend - social conscience - has been more contested. At the centre of this is the Milanese photographer Oliviero Toscani and his former client, the Italian clothing company Benetton. Over the past two decades, Toscani - whose father, a news photographer, took the famous shot of the murdered Mussolini and his mistress, hanging by their feet like trussed chickens - has blasted Benetton to fame.</p> <p>His 'good message' shots were of young people of all colours in Benetton clothes. His 'talk about' shots included a sexy nun, a black stallion mounting a white mare, and a family wailing over an Aids victim. Boutlis writes: 'Like the tabloids or the movies, Benetton ads are sensationalism, entertainment values ironically masquerading as social conscience.'</p> <p>Luciano Benetton gave Toscani full artistic control of his company's campaigns. No wonder - Benetton just sold colourful jumpers, but the 'United Colours' campaign, in Al Young's phrase, gave 'the brand a purpose'. But Toscani wanted to go further. Access to thousands of poster sites and millions of magazine and newspaper pages was, he says, a responsibility as well as a contract - a responsibility to say something. And what he wanted to say, last year, was that the death penalty in the US was wrong.</p> <p>He gained access to death rows in a number of US prisons - in at least one case, according to the prison authorities, fraudulently. He shot poignant pictures of men and women about to die. The campaign, carefully prepared, went up all over the US - just at the time when Benetton's US executive vice-president, Carlo Tunioli, had signed a deal with Sears to incorporate Benetton in its superstores, giving the company a promise of 800 more outlets where previously it had fewer than 200. By the middle of last year, 400 had already been opened. Then the 'Sentenced to Death' campaign began.</p> <p>In Louisville, Kentucky, Donata and Emery Nelson saw, on a billboard, a picture of the man who had abducted, sodomised, tortured and then killed their teenage son. They were furious that Toscani had turned him into a martyr.</p> <p>They began a campaign, picketing Sears wherever they could get a pro-death sentence group together. Sears cancelled the Benetton contract. Toscani's reaction was 'to make me want to laugh, it's so stupid... I am proud, really proud of what I did\". Benetton, however, fired Toscani; the great commercial-radical partnership was over.</p> <p>But it may be more of a temporary retreat than a strategic defeat. Toscani went too far in advertising terms - the acres of publicity were outweighed by the damage he did his client in the lost deal with Sears. But he established a precedent: the overt and committed linking of advertising to social or civil libertarian causes.</p> <p>The ad world, able to produce images, understand trends and catch attention, is now central to our lives, our imaginations and - its best minds now think - our consciences.</p> <p>\u0095 A version of this article appeared in the current issue of New Statesman</p>",

In Talk magazine, the novelist Martin Amis reports that the present trend is towards 'anals', sometimes 'DP', ie, anal and vaginal penetration simultaneously - or beyond that, 'double' or 'triple anals'. With such images circling the earth or humming down the cables, an actress miming masturbation hardly counts as interesting - until the uncools start complaining and a nice little media storm erupts. Then everyone is happy - the uncools, who get something banned; the media people, who get far more space than they paid for; and the client, who gets the product excitingly identified with bad-girl or bad-boy-ness. But the second advertising trend - social conscience - has been more contested. At the centre of this is the Milanese photographer Oliviero Toscani and his former client, the Italian clothing company Benetton. Over the past two decades, Toscani - whose father, a news photographer, took the famous shot of the murdered Mussolini and his mistress, hanging by their feet like trussed chickens - has blasted Benetton to fame. His 'good message' shots were of young people of all colours in Benetton clothes. His 'talk about' shots included a sexy nun, a black stallion mounting a white mare, and a family wailing over an Aids victim. Boutlis writes: 'Like the tabloids or the movies, Benetton ads are sensationalism, entertainment values ironically masquerading as social conscience.' Luciano Benetton gave Toscani full artistic control of his company's campaigns. No wonder - Benetton just sold colourful jumpers, but the 'United Colours' campaign, in Al Young's phrase, gave 'the brand a purpose'. But Toscani wanted to go further. Access to thousands of poster sites and millions of magazine and newspaper pages was, he says, a responsibility as well as a contract - a responsibility to say something. And what he wanted to say, last year, was that the death penalty in the US was wrong. He gained access to death rows in a number of US prisons - in at least one case, according to the prison authorities, fraudulently. He shot poignant pictures of men and women about to die. The campaign, carefully prepared, went up all over the US - just at the time when Benetton's US executive vice-president, Carlo Tunioli, had signed a deal with Sears to incorporate Benetton in its superstores, giving the company a promise of 800 more outlets where previously it had fewer than 200. By the middle of last year, 400 had already been opened. Then the 'Sentenced to Death' campaign began. In Louisville, Kentucky, Donata and Emery Nelson saw, on a billboard, a picture of the man who had abducted, sodomised, tortured and then killed their teenage son. They were furious that Toscani had turned him into a martyr. They began a campaign, picketing Sears wherever they could get a pro-death sentence group together. Sears cancelled the Benetton contract. Toscani's reaction was 'to make me want to laugh, it's so stupid... I am proud, really proud of what I did\". Benetton, however, fired Toscani; the great commercial-radical partnership was over. But it may be more of a temporary retreat than a strategic defeat. Toscani went too far in advertising terms - the acres of publicity were outweighed by the damage he did his client in the lost deal with Sears. But he established a precedent: the overt and committed linking of advertising to social or civil libertarian causes. The ad world, able to produce images, understand trends and catch attention, is now central to our lives, our imaginations and - its best minds now think - our consciences. \u0095 A version of this article appeared in the current issue of New Statesman",

He is deeply worried by the Bush stance on abortion and Hague's threat to copy it: 'I remember the days of back-street abortions; young girls arriving dead in casualty.

He cannot understand the squeamishness, especially not if, as he suggests, a national body was set up to oversee this and regulate, at last, the provision of sperm and eggs.

      "bodyText": "The controversy over bosses prying on employees' private emails took a new twist last night with the disclosure that workers at the Sellafield atomic energy complex have been suspended for sending 'offensive' material. The 'sexually explicit' messages were discovered by British Nuclear Fuels management last week and traced to the staff, who now face disciplinary action. The offending emails are thought to be ones involving TV cartoon character Bart Simpson and a donkey, which resulted in the sacking of 10 insurance workers and the suspension of a further 90 at Royal Sun Alliance in Liverpool earlier this month. Four lawyers at the City of London firm Norton Rose were suspended last month for circulating an email about oral sex. This later found its way to millions of computer screens around the world. BNFL has suspended three of its staff and six agency and contract workers for sending and opening the messages. However, unions claim the company has overreacted, threatening the already sour relations between managers and workers. Sellafield has had serious morale and industrial relations problems since three workers were sacked for falsifying data about fuel rods to be shipped to Japan. In March last year police were called in after a saboteur - believed to be a worker at the complex - damaged a robot and forced a plant treating nuclear waste to be shut down. There have been a series of other incidents involving safety at the plant which have led to disciplinary action against workers. A source in the GMB union, which represents three of the suspended workers, confirmed the action taken against them. 'There have been serious attempts to get industrial relations back on track at Sellafield, but BNFL is threatening to undermine all progress by doing this,' the source said. 'It will seriously damage relations at the plant, which we find concerning. 'We would never condone sending offensive material or internet porn, but these are emails involving cartoon characters, and we think this does not merit suspension.' A BNFL spokesman confirmed that the emails had been traced and the workers suspended. However, he was not prepared to discuss the contents of the message. 'I have not seen it, and I have no wish to,' he said. However, he added: 'We categorise this as offensive material, not pornographic. It is not something you would find acceptable being pinned up on the office wall. We found it unacceptable, and so the workers have been suspended.' The GMB said it would represent its members at any disciplinary hearing.",

No disclaimer to this effect appears in the article.</p> <p>The article was a spin-off from a best-selling book, The Big Madness, that Cohn-Bendit wrote in 1975 about child education. The book drew on his two-year experience working in a Frankfurt kindergarten with children aged from two to five. In the article, he wrote: 'My constant flirt with all the children soon took on erotic characteristics. I could really feel how from the age of five the small girls had already learnt to make passes at me. It's hardly believable.

'Our idea was to let them realise their personalities through expression of their needs. Paedophilia was not what got me going.'</p> <p>But Cohn-Bendit's former stance on the kinderladen movement opens up many unanswered questions about the social and sexual mores of the post-war generation.

      "body": "<p>No one quite remembers when Fabien Barthez broke with family tradition in his home village of La Roque d'Olmes at the foot of the Pyrenees and started playing with a round ball. </p> <p>But what they do know is that Barthez, at eight, was a registered rugby player on 4 May, 1979, the date of his first licence. And that, in the months ahead, he had to go a few miles up the road to nearby Lavelanet to find a football club. There simply wasn't one where he lived. </p> <p>For the roots of Barthez are set deep in the French heartland of rugby where grandad Vincent was a well-known fly-half, and father Alain a top-class full-back who played for his country. </p> <p>The No 16 jersey Barthez wore to win the World Cup for France now lies in the coffin of the rugby-playing grandfather he adored. It is a moving and eloquent testimony to the family tradition that seemed to earmark Manchester United star Barthez for the game with no place for a goalkeeper. </p> <p>According to folks in La Roque d'Olmes, Barthez had just as much potential to contest the Six Nations tournament that opens this week as the closing stages of the Champions League. Felix Picon, who oversees the local club's rugby school, said : 'I saw Fabien playing for us from the ages of eight to 13. He was a lively boy who was quick, skilful and extremely brave. </p> <p>'I am quite sure that, with his background, he would have gone all the way if he had stuck with rugby because he had all the gifts.

      "bodyText": "No one quite remembers when Fabien Barthez broke with family tradition in his home village of La Roque d'Olmes at the foot of the Pyrenees and started playing with a round ball. But what they do know is that Barthez, at eight, was a registered rugby player on 4 May, 1979, the date of his first licence. And that, in the months ahead, he had to go a few miles up the road to nearby Lavelanet to find a football club. There simply wasn't one where he lived. For the roots of Barthez are set deep in the French heartland of rugby where grandad Vincent was a well-known fly-half, and father Alain a top-class full-back who played for his country. The No 16 jersey Barthez wore to win the World Cup for France now lies in the coffin of the rugby-playing grandfather he adored. It is a moving and eloquent testimony to the family tradition that seemed to earmark Manchester United star Barthez for the game with no place for a goalkeeper. According to folks in La Roque d'Olmes, Barthez had just as much potential to contest the Six Nations tournament that opens this week as the closing stages of the Champions League. Felix Picon, who oversees the local club's rugby school, said : 'I saw Fabien playing for us from the ages of eight to 13. He was a lively boy who was quick, skilful and extremely brave. 'I am quite sure that, with his background, he would have gone all the way if he had stuck with rugby because he had all the gifts. He would have developed into a top-class fly-half.' Though Barthez chose to abandon the first organised sport he ever played in favour of football, the family inheritance has not gone to waste. Even Pierre Berbizier, the former France player and coach, says : 'Fabien's made from other stuff than the classic footballer. He has everything that goes to make a rugby man, the mind, the essential touch of madness - afraid of nothing, ready at all times to throw himself into the fires.' United fans have noted that Barthez, a Footballer of the Year candidate in his first Premiership season, is a compelling mix of courage and audacity.

      "body": "<p><strong>It looked like a sudden announcement last weekend that you were retiring from international football. When did you reach the decision?</strong></p> <p>Like most decisions in my life, I try not to make them impulsively. I do sit with them for a great deal of time. I suppose I first thought about it after France 98 and since then I've taken it like I take my life, one day or one game at a time. If I felt I could do it, I went and played to the best of my ability, proud to play for my country, and every time I enjoyed it. I was 31 at France 98 and at the time I had played 550 games. Now I'm coming up to 640 games so the thought has been there for a while. It felt like the time was right. </p> <p><strong> Can you confirm the reasons why you are retiring?</strong> </p> <p>I love playing for my country but when I come back injured, it's not very fair on Arsenal. They pay my wages, I've made a commitment to them with a new contract and I don't feel I am giving them what they are paying for. My father always said 'a fair day's pay for a fair day's work' and that's always stuck with me. But at no stage did Ars\u00e8ne Wenger or the club put any pressure on me. I've only played 16 club games this year out of 33. Last year it was 33 in the season, before that 40 so there's been a degeneration. After the France game in September, I was out for three weeks. Now I don't think that's very fair on Arsenal. </p> <p><strong> Some people will say you jumped before you were pushed.</strong> </p> <p>(Adams laughs). I could maybe say something flippant like I don't care what people say, but I do. It hurts. But jump before I was pushed? Who knows what Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson will go for? I would love to have given him a 24-year-old Tony Adams but it's not possible. If he didn't select me, that's fine as well. But other people's decisions are out of my control. </p> <p><strong> And it is said that you quit because you knew David Beckham would be captain.</strong> </p> <p>Captaincy is a complete honour and I thought I did really well as captain. But I also played under David Platt and Alan Shearer, when I thought I should have been captain - but that's cool, that's the manager's decision. I tried to get on with my job to the best of my ability. I don't know who Mr Eriksson is going to make captain, it was just an honour being talked about for it. I was out of the England squad for three years, never mind being captain. </p> <p><strong> Does having a foreign coach for the first time have any bearing on your decision?</strong> </p> <p>None. I play for a French manager now. Mr Eriksson might be the best manager in the world. I'm an Englishman and I want a successful England team. And I'm going to be a fan. I'll probably travel to watch games and cheer the country on. I'd like to go to a World Cup or European Championship as a spectator. That would be lovely. </p> <p><strong> What have been the highlights of your England career?</strong> </p> <p>The major competitions, a World Cup and two European Championships, particularly '96 when we were fairly successful and enormously unlucky. Just a penalty away from going on to win that, but that was the way it was meant to be. The first cap was special, against Spain in Madrid, alongside Terry Butcher, Kenny Sansom and Viv Anderson, with Gary Lineker scoring four at the other end. It was a fantastic stadium and I was playing with and against people at the top of their trade. Then I brought the shirt home for my mother and father and we had a party. </p> <p>There have been loads of special memories, including recently playing the World and European champions in Paris and drawing 1-1, and leading out my country in what will now be my last international, against Germany at Wembley. And I thought I played pretty well that day. </p> <p><strong> What do you consider your best performance?</strong> </p> <p>Against the Germans in the '96 semi-final. I was really in the zone around that time, in jazz terms really swinging. Terry Venables asked me to play a very demanding role. I was marking Andy M\u00f6ller, as well as being a sweeper and moving into midfield at times. I had to be at my peak to fulfil what he wanted. And I felt I got it all together. </p> <p><strong> What were the low points?</strong> </p> <p>I had a tough time at Euro 2000 with injury. It was frustrating because if we had got through I was ready to play against Italy in the quarter-finals. Being powerless was hard to take. Then there was Euro 88. But they were all learning curves. I grew enormously from them, though they were painful at the time. I wouldn't swap any bad game for a good one. It was all part of the process, how you deal with things, and they were instrumental in my career. I saw David Beckham coming back from France 98 and winning the treble. It can work like that if you learn from adversity. After Euro 88 I came back and won the title with Arsenal in '89. </p> <p><strong> This new contract takes you to the summer of 2002. Do you think then you will retire from club football?</strong> </p> <p>I think so, although ending my international career may open things up. I may find that with the amount of time I have to recover I'll be able to go on for longer. </p> <p><strong> And what do you think you can achieve with Arsenal over the next 18 months?</strong> </p> <p>It's one of the best squads I have ever played in but at the moment it is under-achieving and it will be a challenge to get the full potential out of it. I don't want to be in my armchair when I finish, or going on TV, saying, 'Look at the state of Arsenal'. I want to walk away with dignity and give them some continuity. I'd like to win more things - I haven't given up on that. I don't see myself fading out, I've never been a fading-out kind of guy. There are people at the club who can take it forward. </p> <p><strong> Like Patrick Vieira, whom you are grooming to be captain?</strong> </p> <p>He's a different guy, a different personality. But I feel he has the capacity to lead by the power of example. He has a wonderful desire and will to win that you need and that other men look up to. A man who has had a lot of success but is hungry for more. And he is learning from his mistakes. I always had the big picture of the team. I had that gift. Patrick hasn't got it, though he has other things I haven't got and he can learn. I think he just needs a little more player-management skills, needs to be a bit more observant about what makes people tick. That will come with experience through verbalising. But he needs to verbalise with his own team, not the other team. </p> <p><strong> Why do you think Arsenal are under-achieving?</strong> </p> <p>There's been a change of personnel and it's taking time for some players to get settled in this country. It's an issue, but one we can address. I think we're turning a corner. We're getting the desire back, then the confidence comes. </p> <p>Training has been encouraging and people have got the bit between their teeth. Last Monday, we played basketball and there was an edge to it, a desire to win. On Tuesday, Patrick and I played two v two with Robert Pires and Sylvain Wiltord and I won again. You learn from exercises like that that you can't let your mate down. That if you don't put in the effort, you get shown up. You have to carry that on to the pitch on a Saturday. That desire goes hand in hand with talent, and with the talent we have will bring success again. </p> <p><strong> Are you banging heads together again?</strong> </p> <p>That's happened and will continue, because I've been able to get into training and get out on the pitch. You can't do it from a medical room. You have to be out there with them. That's another reason why I wanted to finish the international career. </p> <p><strong> What will you do when you retire next year?</strong> </p> <p>First, spend some time with my family. I discussed my international retirement with my children, Oliver, Amber and Clare and they were in favour of seeing their dad more, having him pick them up from school - except perhaps Clare, who is 16! I want to take them skiing. Have a Christmas away, spend a Christmas night with them instead of rushing off to a game. Kids grow up and leave so quickly. I just want to be part of their lives. Then some sun on the bones in January. I'll need a rest when I'm finished, time to think. </p> <p><strong> Will you go into coaching or management?</strong> </p> <p>I do feel that knowledge is to be passed on and not owned. And I feel I have a lot to offer, though I don't know at what level or capacity. I haven't had time to do my coaching badge yet but they are fast-tracking players and if I find the time I will do it. I've got to balance that with kids, walking the dogs, learning the piano and my French. I don't think I'm not going to be busy. I can't see myself putting my feet up for too long. I get a bit bored if I'm not active. I will think about management at some stage. </p> <p><strong> How about managing Arsenal one day? Could you do it?</strong> </p> <p>(Long pause) The idea appeals to me and I'm not going to rule that out. But it's easy to say I could do it. I had to learn to be a professional footballer. I served an apprenticeship. There were a lot of mistakes to be made, there was a lot to learn. I'm not going to be egotistical and say I could jump into the Arsenal job. Maybe I need to learn, to get my coaching badge, to have a look around at a few clubs, to manage a small club. A lot goes into it. But yes, I could do it! </p> <p><strong> What about England?</strong> </p> <p>A lot of things go into the England job. If I felt there was a need for me to educate the media and get into the politics of football, then I would get involved. The problem in this country is a culture of denial and sometimes the reality of things is different from what is reported. Some people in the media should think about retiring themselves. They're still writing the same stuff as years ago and I think the public deserve better. If I could influence the media, the structure and politics of the industry, then you never know, I don't rule it out, either. </p> <p><strong> Would it worry you that you might go from hero to villain?</strong> </p> <p>A villain in some people's eyes. But as long as I stay true to myself, I'm never going to be a villain. I'm the one I have to live with. It's funny. Since I stopped drinking and have been in therapy, I think people's perception of me has been pretty much spot-on. The feedback is very positive. That's not to say I do it to please them. I do it because it is right for me. I care about the society I live and work in. I care about my children. I try to do my bit. To keep my side of the street clean. </p> <p><strong> And how is the addiction treatment centre you are planning coming along?</strong> </p> <p>It's called the Sporting Chance Clinic and it's a non-profit-making charity. I may have found a property for a 16-bed facility, so we are getting there. I have people with vast experience working on it at the moment, people who get results. I am not going to put my name to something I don't believe works. It will open when it's right, maybe in June. Before then, possibly from April, I hope to have counselling available to any sportsmen and women who have the courage to seek help, from football or any other sport. The aim is to give a chance to sporting people, retired or active, to get the best available therapy. I think back to that time when for me there seemed nowhere to go. In this country there is still a lot of shame about the illness, people think you are weak-willed. But I know it took enormous courage for me to accept my alcoholism. </p> <p><em>Ian Ridley was the co-writer of Tony Adams' autobiography 'Addicted'.</em></p>",

In a newspaper article last week, he was quoted as saying that England still needed what Adams had to offer - they probably needed him as much as ever - and that he was being selfish. </p> <p>Charlton was right on both counts - but, as far as the latter point is concerned, I personally do not see how anyone can reasonably quibble with it. There are situations in which players have to be selfish to be able to keep giving their best.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>When I was 13, I won a five-year diary in a Puffin Club competition. I could not have been happier. It had a scarlet and green psychedelic cover and a little lock with a gold key. And on its cover were the words: 'My Secret Life'. I did not have a secret life but it was wonderful to suppose that somehow, through keeping the diary, I would acquire one. For five years, I kept it, never missing a day. There was about an inch of paper available for each entry so it did not take much effort to be faithful to it. I still have it, never look at it and blame it for a habit that I have not been able to break. </p> <p>It is now 28 January and there will be some who will already have let their resolution to keep a diary lapse into unfilled white pages. </p> <p>'How many years have I made it to 28 Jan?' Marcia Foreman asks herself. Each year, she starts a diary but has 'usually abandoned it by 12 Jan'. Why? 'I want my diary to be a ruthless record. I resolve not to lie to the diary or to anyone else. But I am disgusted by my own inability to stick to this.' She adds: 'Either nothing happened and I don't know how to elaborate, or too much happened and I don't know what to make of it so can't write.' She suggests that diary keeping is defined by 'shame'. In a recent interview, Joely Richardson also seemed to imply that diary writing was a sign of trouble. Now that her life has picked up (new love with Jamie Theakston), her journal has been put aside. </p> <p>I keep my diaries on a high shelf. I have only to eye their covers to feel nervous distaste. Re-reading diaries is a melancholy experience: happier times diminish the present; there is no joy in remembered unhappiness. So why keep a diary at all? </p> <p>Adam Phillips, psychotherapist and writer, suggests that a diary is a way of being a witness to one's own life, something that is harder than you might suppose. It is a way of 'trying to see what you are doing, to hear what you are saying'. A diary makes links. He suggests: 'One's first diarist is one's mother who links facts for one, holds the pieces together.' </p> <p>Phillips has never kept a diary. He is afraid he might 'submit' to it. What does he mean? He does not want to 'rid' himself of time. A diary makes experience 'historical'. He concedes that a diary may be therapeutic. He sees it as 'the conversation you fear with some one else, the one in which you couldn't hold your own'. </p> <p>Rebecca Dix, an intermittent diarist agrees: 'It is like the Greek legend about the king who whispered his secrets to the grass. In a diary, you can alleviate a pressure to say the unsayable. It may be something you haven't even said to yourself, revealed through writing.' </p> <p>All Dix's diaries are ragged notebooks, she says. She is resistant to pretty, 'flowery' diaries, finding there is a 'weird constraint' about them. Like Katherine Mansfield, she sees her diary, at its best, as an intimate, a 'dear companion'. </p> <p>Jonathan Coe has found something unusual to do with the diary he kept between 1978-9. He has used it as source material for a novel about his schooldays The Rotters' Club (published by Viking in March). At first, he was squeamishly reluctant to re-encounter his 16-year-old self. But he took his diary away to a cottage by the sea - he planned to write there for a week - and was surprised by what he found. For a start, he discovered he had addressed himself to an audience in his diary. </p> <p>'I'd do suspense things, like describing a nasty thing that happened in the classroom and then saying, \"I bet you are all wondering how wondering how that turned out.\"' He expressed emotions in a 'comic, truncated, rather male way.' </p> <p>One moment, he would miserably confess to a crush on a girl but would, in the next sentence, record a 'great episode of New Avengers on TV'. Coe was 'embarrassed and impressed' by his adolescent old voice and its 'magisterial eighteenth-century prose' (he was studying Henry Fielding for A-level). The comedy of his diary was in the 'incongruity of the elevated style and the crashing monotony of what I was recording'. It had a 'weird, unearned assurance'. </p> <p>In this incontinently confessional age, is there still a place for the unpublished diary? On the internet there is a site for diarists, <a href=\"http://www.diarist.net/registry\">www.diarist.net/registry</a>, where it is possible to write and read indiscriminately. It is visited by thousands of curious people. It is a peculiar admission that what diarists long for is an audience other than themselves. </p> <p>Who are diaries for? Diary writing often seems airless, it lacks the oxygen of an audience. It can seem solipsistic, bordering on demented - writing to yourself. Jonathan Hall sees his diary as a letter to himself. He only looks at his old diaries when his life changes in 'a frightening or significant way'- as if to find out who he is. He sometimes imagines that, at the end of his life, he may look at his diaries again but admits they may be waiting for a rainy day that never comes. Some people self-consciously keep diaries which they hope will be discovered as literary gems by their grandchildren. Jonathan Hall has no time for such people: 'Keeping a diary should not be a form of vanity publishing.' </p> <p>A diary is often a way of trying to cheat mortality: self-memorialising, a garrulous epitaph. Rebecca Dix believes: 'It is about leaving yourself behind, it is almost a message in a bottle.' And yet there are diarists - Evelyn Waugh and Philip Larkin - who burnt their diaries and Katherine Mansfield did not want hers published (she was overruled posthumously by John Middleton Murry). And Marcia Foreman's cousin keeps a diary which she says is is incredibly dull but must be burned before she dies. </p> <p>Who is the audience for a diary? In Bad Blood, Lorna Sage's autobiography, she quotes from her grandfather's journals. He was a philandering vicar who had reason to keep his sins under his surplice. But Sage concludes: 'His secrets [in the diary] are like the secrets of a character delivering a stage soliloquy who \"doesn't know\" he has an audience. Grandpa was always writing for Grandma in a certain sense, inconvenient though the consequences of her getting her hands on the written \"evidence\" may have been.' </p> <p>By writing a diary, you give the private concrete form. As Adam Phillips observes: 'If you really believed in privacy you wouldn't write anything down.' A diary is 'an elaborate project. You have to find the time to write it, hide it - it is almost like a criminal activity'. </p> <p>Frances Newton suggests that diary keeping is both addictive and a chore. 'It is a peculiarly collusive vice. People leave their diaries around but are morally indignant when they are read.' She bravely admits to having read her lovers' diaries: 'Most of us have. It is totally irresistible, although you never find what you want to find.' </p> <p>There are only a few good publishable diaries (compared to novels, for example) - Pepys, Boswell, Coleridge, Anne Frank, Virginia Woolf. What do they have in common? Only that they can all write. (Diaries written for publication - Tony Benn's and Alan Bennett's - ought to go by some other name.) But being able to write is not the whole story (or diary). Why is this? Why is it so difficult to produce a great diary? Phillips suggests it is because of the ambivalence already discussed.

      "bodyText": "When I was 13, I won a five-year diary in a Puffin Club competition. I could not have been happier. It had a scarlet and green psychedelic cover and a little lock with a gold key. And on its cover were the words: 'My Secret Life'. I did not have a secret life but it was wonderful to suppose that somehow, through keeping the diary, I would acquire one. For five years, I kept it, never missing a day. There was about an inch of paper available for each entry so it did not take much effort to be faithful to it. I still have it, never look at it and blame it for a habit that I have not been able to break. It is now 28 January and there will be some who will already have let their resolution to keep a diary lapse into unfilled white pages. 'How many years have I made it to 28 Jan?' Marcia Foreman asks herself. Each year, she starts a diary but has 'usually abandoned it by 12 Jan'. Why? 'I want my diary to be a ruthless record. I resolve not to lie to the diary or to anyone else. But I am disgusted by my own inability to stick to this.' She adds: 'Either nothing happened and I don't know how to elaborate, or too much happened and I don't know what to make of it so can't write.' She suggests that diary keeping is defined by 'shame'. In a recent interview, Joely Richardson also seemed to imply that diary writing was a sign of trouble. Now that her life has picked up (new love with Jamie Theakston), her journal has been put aside. I keep my diaries on a high shelf. I have only to eye their covers to feel nervous distaste. Re-reading diaries is a melancholy experience: happier times diminish the present; there is no joy in remembered unhappiness. So why keep a diary at all? Adam Phillips, psychotherapist and writer, suggests that a diary is a way of being a witness to one's own life, something that is harder than you might suppose. It is a way of 'trying to see what you are doing, to hear what you are saying'. A diary makes links. He suggests: 'One's first diarist is one's mother who links facts for one, holds the pieces together.' Phillips has never kept a diary. He is afraid he might 'submit' to it. What does he mean? He does not want to 'rid' himself of time. A diary makes experience 'historical'. He concedes that a diary may be therapeutic. He sees it as 'the conversation you fear with some one else, the one in which you couldn't hold your own'. Rebecca Dix, an intermittent diarist agrees: 'It is like the Greek legend about the king who whispered his secrets to the grass. In a diary, you can alleviate a pressure to say the unsayable. It may be something you haven't even said to yourself, revealed through writing.' All Dix's diaries are ragged notebooks, she says. She is resistant to pretty, 'flowery' diaries, finding there is a 'weird constraint' about them. Like Katherine Mansfield, she sees her diary, at its best, as an intimate, a 'dear companion'. Jonathan Coe has found something unusual to do with the diary he kept between 1978-9. He has used it as source material for a novel about his schooldays The Rotters' Club (published by Viking in March). At first, he was squeamishly reluctant to re-encounter his 16-year-old self. But he took his diary away to a cottage by the sea - he planned to write there for a week - and was surprised by what he found. For a start, he discovered he had addressed himself to an audience in his diary. 'I'd do suspense things, like describing a nasty thing that happened in the classroom and then saying, \"I bet you are all wondering how wondering how that turned out.\"' He expressed emotions in a 'comic, truncated, rather male way.' One moment, he would miserably confess to a crush on a girl but would, in the next sentence, record a 'great episode of New Avengers on TV'. Coe was 'embarrassed and impressed' by his adolescent old voice and its 'magisterial eighteenth-century prose' (he was studying Henry Fielding for A-level). The comedy of his diary was in the 'incongruity of the elevated style and the crashing monotony of what I was recording'. It had a 'weird, unearned assurance'. In this incontinently confessional age, is there still a place for the unpublished diary? On the internet there is a site for diarists, www.diarist.net/registry, where it is possible to write and read indiscriminately. It is visited by thousands of curious people. It is a peculiar admission that what diarists long for is an audience other than themselves. Who are diaries for? Diary writing often seems airless, it lacks the oxygen of an audience. It can seem solipsistic, bordering on demented - writing to yourself. Jonathan Hall sees his diary as a letter to himself. He only looks at his old diaries when his life changes in 'a frightening or significant way'- as if to find out who he is. He sometimes imagines that, at the end of his life, he may look at his diaries again but admits they may be waiting for a rainy day that never comes. Some people self-consciously keep diaries which they hope will be discovered as literary gems by their grandchildren. Jonathan Hall has no time for such people: 'Keeping a diary should not be a form of vanity publishing.' A diary is often a way of trying to cheat mortality: self-memorialising, a garrulous epitaph. Rebecca Dix believes: 'It is about leaving yourself behind, it is almost a message in a bottle.' And yet there are diarists - Evelyn Waugh and Philip Larkin - who burnt their diaries and Katherine Mansfield did not want hers published (she was overruled posthumously by John Middleton Murry). And Marcia Foreman's cousin keeps a diary which she says is is incredibly dull but must be burned before she dies. Who is the audience for a diary? In Bad Blood, Lorna Sage's autobiography, she quotes from her grandfather's journals. He was a philandering vicar who had reason to keep his sins under his surplice. But Sage concludes: 'His secrets [in the diary] are like the secrets of a character delivering a stage soliloquy who \"doesn't know\" he has an audience. Grandpa was always writing for Grandma in a certain sense, inconvenient though the consequences of her getting her hands on the written \"evidence\" may have been.' By writing a diary, you give the private concrete form. As Adam Phillips observes: 'If you really believed in privacy you wouldn't write anything down.' A diary is 'an elaborate project. You have to find the time to write it, hide it - it is almost like a criminal activity'. Frances Newton suggests that diary keeping is both addictive and a chore. 'It is a peculiarly collusive vice. People leave their diaries around but are morally indignant when they are read.' She bravely admits to having read her lovers' diaries: 'Most of us have. It is totally irresistible, although you never find what you want to find.' There are only a few good publishable diaries (compared to novels, for example) - Pepys, Boswell, Coleridge, Anne Frank, Virginia Woolf. What do they have in common? Only that they can all write. (Diaries written for publication - Tony Benn's and Alan Bennett's - ought to go by some other name.) But being able to write is not the whole story (or diary). Why is this? Why is it so difficult to produce a great diary? Phillips suggests it is because of the ambivalence already discussed. It may also be because life resists form and has no controllable plot. I look at today's date - 28 Jan - and looked at some published diaries on my shelves. I found that, with one exception, they had something in common. All were complaints or lamentations. Here is Anne Frank (1944) whose diary was in letter form: 'Dearest Kitty, this morning I was wondering whether you ever felt like a cow, having to chew my stale news over and over again until you're so fed up with the monotonous fare that you yawn and secretly wish Anne would dig up something new.' Alan Clark, 28 Jan 1991: 'I loathe being in London on Sunday evenings, and last night I had to come up so as to be in time this morning for another of these useless ministerial conferences, scheduled for 8.30, never start until 9... The flat is bleak and shabby, and takes a couple of hours to heat up. There is dust and grime, and crumbs in, not on, in - the carpet.'

Or did Cornelius suspect his wife of covert diary reading? Dorothy Wordsworth on 28 Jan 1802, was in poor shape. And so was William: 'A downright rain. A wet night.

      "body": "<p>Do you ever feel superior to your husband? Do you think everything would be fine if only he did what you said? Do you criticise him when he misloads the dishwasher? Do you imitate the way he clears his throat to make your friends laugh? Do you have a hard time remembering why you married him? Do you ever look at him when he's fast asleep and snoring, and wish he were someone else? If you answered yes to any of these questions, Laura Doyle, America's new self-help queen, has some very bad news for you. It's not your husband's fault that he falls so short of your expectations. The person you should be blaming is yourself. </p> <p>Do you want to know why? If the answer is no, you'd better flee the country, because when her book comes out in Britain in a few weeks' time, it's set to get the full tabloid puff, and there will be no escaping it. So you might as well know now what you've been doing wrong all this time. The biggest mistake you ever made was throwing away your bunny suit. Let's face it, there isn't a man on earth who isn't desperate for a good, old-fashioned, full-service wife. But please, don't panic! Not that long ago, Laura's husband was just as unhappy as your husband is right now. Maybe he was even worse, because she used to do such awful things like yell at him when he didn't pick up his beer cans and roll her eyes when they were on the freeway and he missed their exit. But then she got what was coming to her because he started watching television to avoid talking to her. She went into a terrible panic, but that turned out to be a blessing in disguise. </p> <p>Because it made her use her eyes. It made her look around her neighbourhood and see that the happiest marriages in her particular corner of Orange County, California, were the ones in which the women willingly bowed down to their men. So she decided to try it out on Mr. Couch Potato, to see if that perked him up at all. The results were spectacular, so then she closed her eyes and handed over the household finances, saying she trusted his judgement utterly. She started keeping her mouth shut, except to tell him everything he thought and did was wonderful, even when it wasn't. He perked up even more, and then she started closing her eyes when he was driving, and hey presto, he started driving better, or at least more manfully. </p> <p>She still had to struggle to keep her less kind thoughts to herself, though. She had to keep telling herself: 'Don't try to control him'. That was a mouthful, if you had to say it over and over. So she decided to reduce it to a one-word mantra: surrender. </p> <p>The mantra worked wonders in all the compartments of her life, but never so wonderfully as it did in the bedroom. By now her friends were noticing that she and John were acting like a couple of newlyweds, and they wanted to know what her secret was. So she started running a surrendered wives group in her sitting-room, and when the group got too crowded, she started running seminars. When these started multiplying faster than amoebae, she decided the time had come to spread the word nationally. As usual, her hunch was right. </p> <p>After publishing The Surrendered Wife herself a year ago, Simon &amp; Schuster picked it up and this month it did a first print run in the United States of 100,000. The American networks have also shown intense interest, and thanks to their generous coverage, women all over the nation are now setting up surrendered wife support groups. Other women are getting together to tear their hair out. They're concerned for all the obvious reasons. But why non-surrendered women see her as a serious threat is another question. Her message is not new - in many ways it's an update of the Seventies bestseller, Marabel Morgan's The Total Woman, which taught us that the 'total woman caters to her husband's special quirks, whether it be in salad, sex, or sports'. It's been echoed more recently in Ellen Fein's The Rules, Wendy Shalit's A Return to Modesty, and Danielle Crittenden's What Our Mothers Didn't Tell Us. And what Laura Doyle says is not nearly as extreme or obnoxious as her namesake, the family values radio personality Dr Laura Schlesinger whose syndicated daily talk show has 18 million listeners. So you have to wonder why non-surrendered women are paying so much attention to her. </p> <p>It could be her weird mix of self-help styles that non-fans find so exasperating. She doesn't tell women to give up work. Why bother, if you can make the double standard work in your favour? All you have to do is change your attitude, plus a few annoying habits. You have to let go before you can undergo spiritual rebirth. What she's done in essence is to take the total woman and sent her off to a 12-step recovery programme. </p> <p>This, in fact, is where her ideas about surrender come from. The first steps in Alcoholics Anonymous are one: that I admit that I am powerless over alcohol - that my life has become unmanageable. Two: that I come to believe that a Power greater than myself could restore me to sanity, and make a decision to turn my will and my life over to the care of God as I understand Him and come to believe that a Power greater than myself could restore me to sanity. Three: make a decision to turn my will and my life over to the care of God as I understand Him . What Doyle has done is replace the word marriage for alcohol and 'understand' her Higher Power to be her husband. She then suggests that a wife who surrenders her will and her life to a husband is not just going to help his ego and rejuvenate their marriage, but also help her become a power in her own right. Laura did just this, and it worked. </p> <p>But she's still only 32, so maybe she shouldn't count her chickens quite yet, her feminist critics suggest unkindly. Boy, does she get angry, though, if you say this to her face. Feminism may have done a lot for the workplace, but what, she splutters, has it done to help women find fulfilment at home? </p> <p>'It seems to me that these people have simply empowered women to get divorced, become single mothers, get married again, and leave the next man, too, because he's no good. We're empowered to sue for lots of child maintenance, and then live struggling and lonely for the rest of our lives. Just great!' </p> <p>It's not just 'the feminists' who are refusing her message, though. The therapeutic establishment is pretty appalled, too. One of her fiercest critics is John Gottman, considered by many to be the world's leading expert on marriage. All his own research points to the importance of balanced, sharing caring, open and honest communication. So it is not surprising that he finds the surrendered wife concept 'personally offensive and scientifically unfounded'. He may be doing her a favour. It is partly thanks to denunciations like this that The Surrendered Wife, or TSW , as it's known among the faithful, has become the book everyone's talking about. It's sure to be the same in Britain, where there are already a number of TSW groups in electronic communication with Laura. A storm of denunciations at publication time is sure to help her extend her message to many more. But the most important bits of it are bound to get lost among the Chinese whispers. So please, listen carefully, or you'll get the whole thing back to front as so many others have done already. A surrendered wife as Laura defines it 'is not about returning to the Fifties or rebelling against feminism'. It isn't 'about dumbing down or being rigid. It's certainly not about subservience.' It's about following some 'basic principles' that will restore intimacy to your marriage, and with it, peace and joy and inner growth. The main principle is to relinquish 'inappropriate control' of your husband. But you are also supposed to respect his thinking, express gratitude for all he gives you, tell him what you want but never, ever, ever tell him what to do. You must hand the family finances over to him, even if he is bad with money. And you've got to let him have his way with you, even if you don't want it , at least once a week. Do all this, and you will have more time and energy to practise 'self-care' and focus on your own fulfilments, she assures us. In other words, you can surrender at home and still kick ass at work. 'Whether your desire is to have a more harmonious family, run a top corporation, or both, you'll feel increasing pride as you realise your goals faster than ever before.' </p> <p>If her overview seems woolly, her style is anything but. She has to be the bossiest surrendered wife that ever was. She'll state a home truth: 'In marriage, as in nature, water seeks its own level: we marry men who match us. Just as you never see lakes with an uneven surface, you never see couples who aren't perfectly balanced'. Then she'll hit the space bar, and say: 'Really.' </p> <p>Hitting the space bar again, she goes on to tell you to take that man with whom you are perfectly balanced, and put him on a pedestal. Indulge him. Make him feel powerful by making yourself look small. Get on your hands and knees and honour his choice of socks and stocks. Respect what he does even if what he does makes you want to scream. 'Respect means that when he takes the wrong freeway exit you don't correct him by telling him where to turn. It means that if he keeps going in the wrong direction you will go past the state line and still not correct what he's doing. No matter what you husband does, you will not try to teach, improve or correct him.' If that sounds ludicrous to you, she urges you to sit back for a moment and think what happens when you don't keep your mouth shut. 'Disrespecting your husband's choices on a regular basis is like pricking him repeatedly with little pins. Imagine living with a porcupine and you've got the idea of what it's like for him.' </p> <p>Changing yourself into a more amenable animal is not easy, she admits. 'In some cases, not responding may require putting large quantities of duct tape over your mouth. Do whatever it takes.' Whatever he says to you, your response should be: 'Whatever you say.' You have to mean it, too. You have to go along with any plan he makes unless you are very sure it would endanger your health. Utter compliance may feel strange at first, she warns. But: 'Your husband will adore you for it.' Especially you know where. 'Most men aren't interested in having sex with their mothers and that is who we remind them of when we are forever controlling them and telling them what to do. A surrendered wife always says 'yes' and is always available for sex.' </p> <p> 'The first rule for a great sex life is to be respectful and wear something sheer and lacy.' The benefits last far beyond climax. Once you let him exercise his manhood, he'll open up and let down his guard and then you'll have intimacy. 'He may speak about the values he hopes to impart to the children, what he's imagining the two of your will do when you're old, or tell you about how he lost a dog he loved as a kid. Intimacy is made up of lots of little tender conversations - sometimes silly, sometimes solemn - that he wouldn't have with anyone else in the world.' And all you have to do to achieve this heavenly state is to give up your rights. </p> <p>But what if you decide you need them again a year or two down the line? Say you wake up one morning and find out that this wonderful man to whom you've decided to enslave yourself is not so wonderful after all? There is a disturbing testimonial from a woman who used the Surrendered Wife method only to find that it almost landed her in bankruptcy court when her husband ran off with all her money. Another says she's giving up on the surrender idea because her husband is a repulsive slob who plops on to the couch when he gets home from work. </p> <p>None of this fazes the already converted. They carry on regardless, gushing about surrender and exchanging tips about the appropriate response to a man who says: 'Shut the fuck up.' (Most agree that the standard line - 'whatever you think' - may not be appropriate.) They give kind but slightly patronising advice to the men who come on-line to complain about the way their wives talk to them. Every once in a while, a wife will step out of role to lash out at one of the unsurrendered interlopers. One tells a sceptical unmarried mother: 'It's hardly surprising that you are single, as what man would want to marry such an obnoxious, man-hating creature as you?' </p> <p>The most intriguing thing is how raunchy the surrendered wives are. Oh how my mother and her friends would blush to hear the advice they give poor Kim, who has surrendered but still isn't getting as much sex as she craves. The 'keys to a happy marriage' are as follows, says Karen. 'Don't criticise him, let him make the wrong turn, give him lots of oral sex and be sure to swallow.' This is followed by a flurry of postings offering further refinements. </p> <p>What, I wonder, would wives of another age have to say to Jessica who has been trying to surrender to her husband but failing miserably. Even though she now has an 11-month-old with another on the way, she doesn't think of her pregnant body as ugly, 'but pretty and cute'. But her husband finds it 'repulsive, which I think is funny because he has a big jelly belly, a hairy back and other things women would say are a big turn-off'. But still, she wants to make the marriage work. 'I complimented him on his body. I kissed him passionately, I touched his chest, shoulders, etc, all day, hoping it would pay off at some point. My husband disputed all of my compliments. He told me he felt pressured. Like an idiot, I apologised and he started to yell at me for apologising.' Later on, he told her that he hadn't wanted to have to say it, but that he wasn't sexually attracted to her anymore. And how unfair was that? The consensus in the electronic community of surrendered wives is that she should 'reconsider her relationship'. Which is short for: get rid of the guy. This, surprise, surprise, is the central plank of the surrendering philosophy. Surrender is a privilege you should only extend to 'good guys'. Never surrender to a man who is physically abusive to you, or your children, or has an 'active' addiction, or who is chronically unfaithful. It's not worth it, says Laura. Really. You can never achieve intimacy with types like that. </p> <p>The biggest shock for me was finding out how exacting these surrendered wives were when discussing who was good husband material, and how little it took for them to say: 'Forget this guy. He's history.' A lot of the wives had careers they were proud of. A few admitted they earned more than their husbands. One said that was why it was such a relief to hand the money management over. After a long day barking orders at work, it's such a relief, she says, to come home at the end of the day, and kick off your shoes and your work personality, and 'be a woman'. This is what Laura Doyle is telling them: you can have everything you want, so long as you play by one set of rules at work and a very different set at home. That, of course, is what most people do anyway. Even people like myself who would rather die than admit it. Which is why, I suspect, we wish Laura would show us the same courtesy she shows her husband, and keep her stupid, half-baked, insulting grains of truth to herself. </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.surrenderedwife.com\">www.surrenderedwife.com</a></p>",

It's been echoed more recently in Ellen Fein's The Rules, Wendy Shalit's A Return to Modesty, and Danielle Crittenden's What Our Mothers Didn't Tell Us. And what Laura Doyle says is not nearly as extreme or obnoxious as her namesake, the family values radio personality Dr Laura Schlesinger whose syndicated daily talk show has 18 million listeners. So you have to wonder why non-surrendered women are paying so much attention to her. It could be her weird mix of self-help styles that non-fans find so exasperating. She doesn't tell women to give up work. Why bother, if you can make the double standard work in your favour? All you have to do is change your attitude, plus a few annoying habits. You have to let go before you can undergo spiritual rebirth. What she's done in essence is to take the total woman and sent her off to a 12-step recovery programme. This, in fact, is where her ideas about surrender come from. The first steps in Alcoholics Anonymous are one: that I admit that I am powerless over alcohol - that my life has become unmanageable. Two: that I come to believe that a Power greater than myself could restore me to sanity, and make a decision to turn my will and my life over to the care of God as I understand Him and come to believe that a Power greater than myself could restore me to sanity. Three: make a decision to turn my will and my life over to the care of God as I understand Him . What Doyle has done is replace the word marriage for alcohol and 'understand' her Higher Power to be her husband. She then suggests that a wife who surrenders her will and her life to a husband is not just going to help his ego and rejuvenate their marriage, but also help her become a power in her own right. Laura did just this, and it worked. But she's still only 32, so maybe she shouldn't count her chickens quite yet, her feminist critics suggest unkindly. Boy, does she get angry, though, if you say this to her face. Feminism may have done a lot for the workplace, but what, she splutters, has it done to help women find fulfilment at home? 'It seems to me that these people have simply empowered women to get divorced, become single mothers, get married again, and leave the next man, too, because he's no good. We're empowered to sue for lots of child maintenance, and then live struggling and lonely for the rest of our lives. Just great!' It's not just 'the feminists' who are refusing her message, though. The therapeutic establishment is pretty appalled, too. One of her fiercest critics is John Gottman, considered by many to be the world's leading expert on marriage. All his own research points to the importance of balanced, sharing caring, open and honest communication. So it is not surprising that he finds the surrendered wife concept 'personally offensive and scientifically unfounded'. He may be doing her a favour. It is partly thanks to denunciations like this that The Surrendered Wife, or TSW , as it's known among the faithful, has become the book everyone's talking about. It's sure to be the same in Britain, where there are already a number of TSW groups in electronic communication with Laura. A storm of denunciations at publication time is sure to help her extend her message to many more. But the most important bits of it are bound to get lost among the Chinese whispers. So please, listen carefully, or you'll get the whole thing back to front as so many others have done already. A surrendered wife as Laura defines it 'is not about returning to the Fifties or rebelling against feminism'. It isn't 'about dumbing down or being rigid. It's certainly not about subservience.' It's about following some 'basic principles' that will restore intimacy to your marriage, and with it, peace and joy and inner growth. The main principle is to relinquish 'inappropriate control' of your husband. But you are also supposed to respect his thinking, express gratitude for all he gives you, tell him what you want but never, ever, ever tell him what to do. You must hand the family finances over to him, even if he is bad with money. And you've got to let him have his way with you, even if you don't want it , at least once a week. Do all this, and you will have more time and energy to practise 'self-care' and focus on your own fulfilments, she assures us. In other words, you can surrender at home and still kick ass at work. 'Whether your desire is to have a more harmonious family, run a top corporation, or both, you'll feel increasing pride as you realise your goals faster than ever before.' If her overview seems woolly, her style is anything but. She has to be the bossiest surrendered wife that ever was. She'll state a home truth: 'In marriage, as in nature, water seeks its own level: we marry men who match us. Just as you never see lakes with an uneven surface, you never see couples who aren't perfectly balanced'. Then she'll hit the space bar, and say: 'Really.' Hitting the space bar again, she goes on to tell you to take that man with whom you are perfectly balanced, and put him on a pedestal. Indulge him. Make him feel powerful by making yourself look small. Get on your hands and knees and honour his choice of socks and stocks. Respect what he does even if what he does makes you want to scream. 'Respect means that when he takes the wrong freeway exit you don't correct him by telling him where to turn. It means that if he keeps going in the wrong direction you will go past the state line and still not correct what he's doing. No matter what you husband does, you will not try to teach, improve or correct him.' If that sounds ludicrous to you, she urges you to sit back for a moment and think what happens when you don't keep your mouth shut. 'Disrespecting your husband's choices on a regular basis is like pricking him repeatedly with little pins. Imagine living with a porcupine and you've got the idea of what it's like for him.' Changing yourself into a more amenable animal is not easy, she admits. 'In some cases, not responding may require putting large quantities of duct tape over your mouth. Do whatever it takes.' Whatever he says to you, your response should be: 'Whatever you say.' You have to mean it, too. You have to go along with any plan he makes unless you are very sure it would endanger your health. Utter compliance may feel strange at first, she warns. But: 'Your husband will adore you for it.' Especially you know where. 'Most men aren't interested in having sex with their mothers and that is who we remind them of when we are forever controlling them and telling them what to do. A surrendered wife always says 'yes' and is always available for sex.' 'The first rule for a great sex life is to be respectful and wear something sheer and lacy.' The benefits last far beyond climax. Once you let him exercise his manhood, he'll open up and let down his guard and then you'll have intimacy. 'He may speak about the values he hopes to impart to the children, what he's imagining the two of your will do when you're old, or tell you about how he lost a dog he loved as a kid. Intimacy is made up of lots of little tender conversations - sometimes silly, sometimes solemn - that he wouldn't have with anyone else in the world.' And all you have to do to achieve this heavenly state is to give up your rights. But what if you decide you need them again a year or two down the line? Say you wake up one morning and find out that this wonderful man to whom you've decided to enslave yourself is not so wonderful after all? There is a disturbing testimonial from a woman who used the Surrendered Wife method only to find that it almost landed her in bankruptcy court when her husband ran off with all her money. Another says she's giving up on the surrender idea because her husband is a repulsive slob who plops on to the couch when he gets home from work. None of this fazes the already converted. They carry on regardless, gushing about surrender and exchanging tips about the appropriate response to a man who says: 'Shut the fuck up.' (Most agree that the standard line - 'whatever you think' - may not be appropriate.) They give kind but slightly patronising advice to the men who come on-line to complain about the way their wives talk to them. Every once in a while, a wife will step out of role to lash out at one of the unsurrendered interlopers. One tells a sceptical unmarried mother: 'It's hardly surprising that you are single, as what man would want to marry such an obnoxious, man-hating creature as you?' The most intriguing thing is how raunchy the surrendered wives are. Oh how my mother and her friends would blush to hear the advice they give poor Kim, who has surrendered but still isn't getting as much sex as she craves. The 'keys to a happy marriage' are as follows, says Karen. 'Don't criticise him, let him make the wrong turn, give him lots of oral sex and be sure to swallow.' This is followed by a flurry of postings offering further refinements. What, I wonder, would wives of another age have to say to Jessica who has been trying to surrender to her husband but failing miserably. Even though she now has an 11-month-old with another on the way, she doesn't think of her pregnant body as ugly, 'but pretty and cute'. But her husband finds it 'repulsive, which I think is funny because he has a big jelly belly, a hairy back and other things women would say are a big turn-off'. But still, she wants to make the marriage work. 'I complimented him on his body. I kissed him passionately, I touched his chest, shoulders, etc, all day, hoping it would pay off at some point. My husband disputed all of my compliments. He told me he felt pressured. Like an idiot, I apologised and he started to yell at me for apologising.' Later on, he told her that he hadn't wanted to have to say it, but that he wasn't sexually attracted to her anymore. And how unfair was that? The consensus in the electronic community of surrendered wives is that she should 'reconsider her relationship'. Which is short for: get rid of the guy. This, surprise, surprise, is the central plank of the surrendering philosophy. Surrender is a privilege you should only extend to 'good guys'. Never surrender to a man who is physically abusive to you, or your children, or has an 'active' addiction, or who is chronically unfaithful. It's not worth it, says Laura. Really. You can never achieve intimacy with types like that. The biggest shock for me was finding out how exacting these surrendered wives were when discussing who was good husband material, and how little it took for them to say: 'Forget this guy. He's history.' A lot of the wives had careers they were proud of. A few admitted they earned more than their husbands. One said that was why it was such a relief to hand the money management over. After a long day barking orders at work, it's such a relief, she says, to come home at the end of the day, and kick off your shoes and your work personality, and 'be a woman'. This is what Laura Doyle is telling them: you can have everything you want, so long as you play by one set of rules at work and a very different set at home. That, of course, is what most people do anyway. Even people like myself who would rather die than admit it. Which is why, I suspect, we wish Laura would show us the same courtesy she shows her husband, and keep her stupid, half-baked, insulting grains of truth to herself. www.surrenderedwife.com",

      "body": "<p>'I so hate having to think about titles,' Stephen Fry is saying. 'Clearly one must have a title, it's unavoidable, one has to. But it's a nightmare.' </p> <p>Yes, it does seem only a matter of time before Fry is officially garlanded as a Treasure of the British Empire, but for the moment we're talking about the titles of his books - his four bestselling novels, his collection of humorous musings from radio and the press, his brilliant and compelling autobiography, Moab Is My Washpot. </p> <p>'Do you spend a lot of time thinking about titles?' I ask. </p> <p>'Um. No.' </p> <p>I thought not. He laughs. 'No, and it's very important to me that I don't. I can't bear thinking about titles. I get very superstitious about them. I just don't want them to have a title. I can never come up with one and the publishers say, you must come up with one, so I'll say something like, oh...' </p> <p>'Hippopotamus?' I suggest (by coincidence, the name of his second novel). </p> <p>'No, actually that one was quite a good title. But Moab was, well... if you knew the quotation, it would make sense - \"Moab is my washpot and over Edom will I cast my shoe\".' </p> <p>Oh, that Moab, that washpot. </p> <p>We're surrounded by the vestiges of breakfast in a cool Holland Park hotel. Fry leans back and puffs on a Marlboro, even though he has a sore throat and has been at the Day Nurse. He doesn't look too well. I don't think it's too unkind to say that he looks like he might have just woken up in the clothes he might have slept in. </p> <p>But this superstition business. You'd think that anyone who has made so dazzling a success of being a genius in such arcane matters as Moab and washpots and everything else under the sun would have given up having to cross his fingers by now. No need to go through his lustrous CV here; suffice to say, we are long accustomed to commentators thinking they are the first to ask, with mock weariness: 'Is there nothing this man cannot do?' </p> <p>Of course no one's perfect. Fry enjoyed a less than exemplary youth, lying, cheating, idling, scheming and, notably, thieving his way through three schools (see Moab for full expulsion details), before eventually ending up in prison at 17 with no A-levels after running wild with a pair of stolen credit cards. In more recent years, he famously deserted the West End play Cell Mates, following depression and bad reviews of his performance. He intended to kill himself, only at the last minute commuting his self-imposed sentence to visiting Belgium instead. Today, he is a contented man, having subdued if not slayed his demons. He is happily partnered, he has done good work for the Samaritans, he is chummy with Prince Charles, he is adored by the nation. In short, he is ready to host the Baftas. </p> <p>I'm surprised to find that when he fronts the ceremony next month it will be his first time. 'I have been asked to do the Baftas before,' he says. 'I've always been rather hesitant because I don't really see myself as a Clive or an Angus sort of person. No disrespect to them - they do what they do and they do it very well. But because it's the film awards, and one of the things I do myself is act in films, one has to be very sure about the way it's done.' He is happy with the way it's done now. Now it's no longer an event based around eating dinner, where there's the risk of people getting drunk and disorderly. The Baftas are not supposed to be the Brits. </p> <p>This kind of job seems to be made for him. I wonder, given the dispiriting ease with which he can talk in a straight line and be avuncular, funny and brainy at the same time, why we have never seen him doing solo television or a chat show. 'I have been asked to do things like that. But though I may have a facility for chatting, I like to use it for writing, and I like being an actor. I'm never going to get things that Brad Pitt has turned down, but there are a range of things, some of which are highly crunchy cameos and others are more serious parts. If I were to become a \"personality\", I'd be far less likely to be asked. It's like, if suddenly Clive James were to appear in a film, you'd think, hang on... Angus is a good comic actor, but he's less likely to do any now because he fronts so many things.' </p> <p>In any case, he points out, there's hardly a shortage of opportunities to perform off the cuff, as it were. 'Almost everything one does has a press officer attached and smart, besuited young men [he waves his cigarette at hovering smart, besuited young men] who arrange newspaper interviews or beg you to appear on Clive Anderson or Michael Parkinson. Sometimes you find yourself doing a lot of these things. But it goes with the territory. I'm one of those people who was told by schoolmasters that he liked the sound of his own voice.' </p> <p>By his own account in Moab, liking the sound of his own voice was not regarded as a marketable skill at school. Comedians often tell of how they would use humour as a survival tool in the playground and classroom, but Fry seems to have gone straight for provocation. 'It's all part of the same morbid self-disgust that most comedians have. It worked to some extent. The major thought in my head when I woke up was how I was going to get off games that day. And if you knew you were gay in the late Sixties and early Seventies - well, all I had was the library to tell me I wasn't alone. Provocation comes because you feel disgusted with yourself and because you feel a freak, or not one of the gang.' </p> <p>Being hopeless at games and a desperately secret homosexual were bad enough. But he couldn't sing either - the final pillar of shame at any self-respecting public school. So Fry junior lied, he schemed, he pilfered and he read books, becoming clever with words, a wit, a smart arse, a tormentor of teachers, a breaker of bounds, a model of wilful depravity. 'Not joining in' is how he characterises his adolescence. Inwardly tortured and outwardly self-sufficient, he gradually took up the language and nuances of his heroes - in particular Conan Doyle, Wodehouse and the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band oddball Vivian Stanshall - as his shield and sword of differentness. I wonder, then, whether the now familiar tweedy manner and scabrous humour and sudden flights of erudition began back then as an effort to construct the Stephen Fry he consciously wanted to be. </p> <p>'Very much so. But after a while it becomes you. It's like deciding how you're going to sign your name when you're a teenager and you think, shall I do my \"y\"s straight down or hooked, or I rather fancy a Greek \"e\" here, and so on. But eventually it is your autograph. It starts as a kind of mask, as a series of poses that you've gone through in your adolescence, but then it becomes absolutely you. It is inseparable. And it's the same with one's behavioural mannerisms and with one's writing style and perhaps one's personality.' </p> <p>I ask where he gets his brains from. His father - a physicist and inventor - is the quick answer, but this proves merely the signal for an unscheduled excursion round the Greek deity Mnemosyne, mother of the muses, the Battle of Bannockburn, Plato and Nietzsche, before puffing gently into E.M. Forster, who, he says, 'writes about the beast and the monk in us all - \"only connect and both will be exalted\".' For the young Fry, mankind's inherent dichotomy boiled down to a) those devoted to the life of the mind and b) the jockstrapping neanderthals who played rugby. 'You were an aesthete or athlete, and I knew which side I was on. I didn't like Forster's idea of connecting - I didn't want to connect. I didn't want to have a human body at all.' </p> <p>He loves all sport now - well, watching it, anyway. So has he come to terms yet with not being able to do it? Surely he'd rather be brainy than play cricket? </p> <p>'Well I suppose it's the old clich\u00e9 - things you're not good at are the things you want to be good at. I've fallen asleep at nights dreaming of opening the bowling for England. You'd never fall asleep at night thinking of yourself debating or being the next Themistocles.' </p> <p>Some people, I suggest, would give their right bowling arm to be on such familiar terms with the first Themistocles. 'Well, of course, the other man's arse is always cleaner,' he says cheerfully. </p> <p>Fry hardly seems to think before he talks. Unless he does all his thinking when he's dragging on his cigarette, which is quite often. </p> <p>I ask whether three months behind bars brought him to his senses. It did, but it was eventually Cambridge that proved the emotional turning point. It was here that he met Hugh Laurie, his writing partner and oldest friend. 'It was a relationship untainted by any sort of schoolboy rivalry or any sexual overtones. I wasn't in love with him or anything so there was no kind of complication in that sense but we had an absolute instinct. People would remark very quickly after we'd met that we said exactly the same thing at the same time in response to something. We started writing together and we just never stopped.' </p> <p>Was it this unexpected affinity which brought him out of his bunker and made him see that, actually, other people did matter? Was this a conscience-finding moment? </p> <p>'Yes, that's exactly what it was. I'm sure there are all kinds of jargonistic words like \"dissociative\" or something that a pyschiatrist would use but having a conscience and recognising that other people existed - that is absolutely the key. I had a very marked case of adolescent solipsism. It was like The Truman Show. I got sent the script of The Truman Show to see if I might twiddle with it, and as soon as I read that script I thought, my God, that was my life. For most of my teens I had this pretty strong feeling that everyone else was an extra and that as I rounded a corner people would be saying he's coming, he's coming - pretend to be ordinary, pretend to have real lives.' </p> <p>So... walking out of Cell Mates - it must have felt terrible letting everyone down. 'It was a very insane and very bizarre time. It's hard to talk about memories. It can be very hard to reconstruct one's emotions. It's as if there was just foul weather going on in my head.' </p> <p>Was it the disgrace of it that drove him to thoughts of suicide? 'Yes, I think it was partly disgrace. I don't know what goes on in one's mind - it's a whole parade of things, but they don't go through your mind in an ordered way. It's just a big scream inside saying you really just don't want to carry on. You just feel there is absolutely no point. Of course, logically, there is no point. One can be very Beckettian about it and see that there is nothing in store for us really except disappointment and physical pain and degradation and cancer and arthritis and misery.' </p> <p>His error, he says, was to seek happiness in work. 'It was all I was. I had no relationships. I had it in my head that if I was reasonably respected in a world that I liked, and if I had enough money to go on holiday whenever I liked, buy a house of my own, then of course I would be happy. It took a long time to work out that, while I was very pleased not have to worry where the next penny was coming from and have people stop me in the street saying how nice or funny I was, these were not things in themselves that could make me happy. It all built up into my suddenly realising that I was fundamentally terribly miserable.' </p> <p>His next turning point - after years of being one of Britain's most notorious celibates - was falling in love, and a relationship that has brought 'richness to my life'. Some might conclude that he seems to be joining in at last - friends in high places, the possession of a sex life, a readiness to wear the Bafta bow-tie, not to mention monopolising Boxing Day with his reading of Harry Potter. Having experienced happiness, does he now believe in it? </p> <p>'Well, I wouldn't claim that I've found the true path to enlightened bliss. I'm not in a permanent state of happiness. I can still get deeply annoyed if I can't find my car keys but...' </p> <p>'But not enough to want to flee the country again...' </p> <p>'No, no, no.' He stubs out his cigarette. 'Well, not to Belgium anyway.' </p> <p>\u0095 The Bafta film awards will be broadcast on Sky TV on 25 February</p>",

I wonder, then, whether the now familiar tweedy manner and scabrous humour and sudden flights of erudition began back then as an effort to construct the Stephen Fry he consciously wanted to be. 'Very much so. But after a while it becomes you. It's like deciding how you're going to sign your name when you're a teenager and you think, shall I do my \"y\"s straight down or hooked, or I rather fancy a Greek \"e\" here, and so on. But eventually it is your autograph. It starts as a kind of mask, as a series of poses that you've gone through in your adolescence, but then it becomes absolutely you. It is inseparable. And it's the same with one's behavioural mannerisms and with one's writing style and perhaps one's personality.' I ask where he gets his brains from. His father - a physicist and inventor - is the quick answer, but this proves merely the signal for an unscheduled excursion round the Greek deity Mnemosyne, mother of the muses, the Battle of Bannockburn, Plato and Nietzsche, before puffing gently into E.M. Forster, who, he says, 'writes about the beast and the monk in us all - \"only connect and both will be exalted\".' For the young Fry, mankind's inherent dichotomy boiled down to a) those devoted to the life of the mind and b) the jockstrapping neanderthals who played rugby. 'You were an aesthete or athlete, and I knew which side I was on. I didn't like Forster's idea of connecting - I didn't want to connect. I didn't want to have a human body at all.' He loves all sport now - well, watching it, anyway. So has he come to terms yet with not being able to do it? Surely he'd rather be brainy than play cricket? 'Well I suppose it's the old clich\u00e9 - things you're not good at are the things you want to be good at. I've fallen asleep at nights dreaming of opening the bowling for England. You'd never fall asleep at night thinking of yourself debating or being the next Themistocles.' Some people, I suggest, would give their right bowling arm to be on such familiar terms with the first Themistocles. 'Well, of course, the other man's arse is always cleaner,' he says cheerfully. Fry hardly seems to think before he talks. Unless he does all his thinking when he's dragging on his cigarette, which is quite often. I ask whether three months behind bars brought him to his senses. It did, but it was eventually Cambridge that proved the emotional turning point. It was here that he met Hugh Laurie, his writing partner and oldest friend. 'It was a relationship untainted by any sort of schoolboy rivalry or any sexual overtones. I wasn't in love with him or anything so there was no kind of complication in that sense but we had an absolute instinct. People would remark very quickly after we'd met that we said exactly the same thing at the same time in response to something. We started writing together and we just never stopped.' Was it this unexpected affinity which brought him out of his bunker and made him see that, actually, other people did matter? Was this a conscience-finding moment? 'Yes, that's exactly what it was. I'm sure there are all kinds of jargonistic words like \"dissociative\" or something that a pyschiatrist would use but having a conscience and recognising that other people existed - that is absolutely the key. I had a very marked case of adolescent solipsism. It was like The Truman Show. I got sent the script of The Truman Show to see if I might twiddle with it, and as soon as I read that script I thought, my God, that was my life. For most of my teens I had this pretty strong feeling that everyone else was an extra and that as I rounded a corner people would be saying he's coming, he's coming - pretend to be ordinary, pretend to have real lives.' So... walking out of Cell Mates - it must have felt terrible letting everyone down. 'It was a very insane and very bizarre time. It's hard to talk about memories. It can be very hard to reconstruct one's emotions. It's as if there was just foul weather going on in my head.' Was it the disgrace of it that drove him to thoughts of suicide? 'Yes, I think it was partly disgrace. I don't know what goes on in one's mind - it's a whole parade of things, but they don't go through your mind in an ordered way. It's just a big scream inside saying you really just don't want to carry on. You just feel there is absolutely no point. Of course, logically, there is no point. One can be very Beckettian about it and see that there is nothing in store for us really except disappointment and physical pain and degradation and cancer and arthritis and misery.' His error, he says, was to seek happiness in work. 'It was all I was. I had no relationships. I had it in my head that if I was reasonably respected in a world that I liked, and if I had enough money to go on holiday whenever I liked, buy a house of my own, then of course I would be happy. It took a long time to work out that, while I was very pleased not have to worry where the next penny was coming from and have people stop me in the street saying how nice or funny I was, these were not things in themselves that could make me happy. It all built up into my suddenly realising that I was fundamentally terribly miserable.' His next turning point - after years of being one of Britain's most notorious celibates - was falling in love, and a relationship that has brought 'richness to my life'. Some might conclude that he seems to be joining in at last - friends in high places, the possession of a sex life, a readiness to wear the Bafta bow-tie, not to mention monopolising Boxing Day with his reading of Harry Potter. Having experienced happiness, does he now believe in it? 'Well, I wouldn't claim that I've found the true path to enlightened bliss. I'm not in a permanent state of happiness. I can still get deeply annoyed if I can't find my car keys but...' 'But not enough to want to flee the country again...' 'No, no, no.' He stubs out his cigarette. 'Well, not to Belgium anyway.' \u0095 The Bafta film awards will be broadcast on Sky TV on 25 February",

'Here's 40p: get yourself a cup of tea.' </p> <p>The recipient of that Yuletide largesse was Bill Grimsey, the genial working class Londoner regarded as one of the country's top retailers. </p> <p>Only three months earlier, Grimsey scooped more than \u00a32 million in share options for successfully guiding Wickes, the DIY chain, from near bankruptcy to a \u00a3290m venture capital buyout. In the New Year he was to take up the reins as chief executive of Iceland. </p> <p>In the meantime, Grimsey spent a couple of days performing menial supermarket duties in Borehamwood. His driver had to tell the millionaire that it was Iceland company policy not to accept tips. 'What was I supposed to do?' Grimsey asked. 'She would have been gutted.' </p> <p>Grimsey, 48, is probably one of the most hands-on executives in Britain. Why? Because it pays. </p> <p>'Often people in our industry, when they get to director level, start wearing suits and divorcing themselves from the real action. You've got to remember that people who create conditions for failure get paid a lot of money, and the people who have to deal with that failure get paid \u00a34 an hour. </p> <p>'When the guy in charge of marketing gets a price wrong, the customer who complains takes it out on the check-out girl. The guy who makes the mistake is not at the end of that. </p> <p>'The only place that makes any money is the stores, and therefore we have to do everything we can to support those colleagues out there to do their job properly.' </p> <p>Mind you, after the week that Iceland has endured, Grimsey had better start getting his hands dirty. </p> <p>The frozen-food giant with a pioneering reputation last year announced that it would be switching entirely to organic vegetables and buying 40 per cent of the world's supply. Since organic food is more expensive than conventional produce, Iceland ditched its successful 'buy one get one free' offers to protect margins. </p> <p>Last week it was clear this had been a mistake. In a trading statement released last Monday, the company announced that like-for-like sales were down 1.5 per cent over the six months to Christmas and had crashed by 5.5 per cent in the four weeks to 28 December. </p> <p>Iceland's core customers - at the lower end of the economic spectrum and eager for bargain offers - voted with their feet. Shares in the company, which earlier this year touched 319p, now stand at 205p. </p> <p>'What happened last year was that Iceland took its eye off the ball and pursued a strategy which was not totally aligned to our customers,' Grimsey explains. </p> <p>'You can't dictate to customers what they should buy. No brand in the world is big enough for that - ask Marks &amp; Spencer. You have to offer people a choice and move progressively. That was a disastrous policy.' </p> <p>Worse still, a huge question mark hangs over Iceland's chairman, Malcolm Walker. Between 14 and 19 December, Walker sold \u00a313m worth of Iceland shares, just as he was giving retail analysts an upbeat briefing at the group's head office in Deeside, north Wales. </p> <p>The Financial Services Authority may now investigate Walker, who is currently holidaying in the Maldives. The authority's rules are clear on director sharedealing: directors can't buy or sell shares if they are in the possession of unpublished price-sensitive information and board directors fail to approve the deal. </p> <p>Not surprisingly, Grimsey is keen to avoid controversy. 'Malcolm's decision to sell his shares was his decision. It was ratified by the board before I was a member.' </p> <p>But Grimsey is poised to 'press the button' on his own litigation. The son of a structural engineer, he claims that Duke Street Capital, the venture capitalists that bought Wickes, owe him the best part of \u00a3300,000 for an unpaid one-year contract. </p> <p>He fears court action may distract him from putting Iceland back on an even keel, but wants 'what's rightfully mine'. </p> <p>Grimsey's next quarter will mostly be spent formulating a strategic plan to expand a company which last year bought Booker, the wholesale food outfit. He believes the future lies in home shopping, which he says will make sense of that merger. </p> <p>'We are a convenience store, a frozen-food specialist which offers good deals to people on tight budgets. I'm going to return the business to its grass roots while I look at how to grow the business from the platform we've got.' </p> <p>Acknowledging that Iceland's core market is probably a diminishing one, Grimsey says: 'I believe that technology and home shopping will offer this group a tremendous opportunity. We have 181 Booker warehouse depots; 95 per cent of the UK population live within a 15-minute drive of a Booker warehouse. </p> <p>'We can do the same ranges as the big guys, although we'll have to do some work on fresh foods. We can challenge for a wider population.' </p> <p>Grimsey is something of a retail junkie. As a child, he admits, he loved going shopping with his mother.

      "body": "<p>Beware retailers who seem to defy gravity. That is the hard lesson that investors learnt first from Matalan but had reinforced last week by Ted Baker. </p> <p>Shares in the shirt-maker plunged by a quarter last week after it announced that its Christmas sales were up by 19 per cent. That is a better performance than most on the high street could dream of but it was below the expectations of management and, more importantly, the City. </p> <p>As Matalan learnt when it produced a similar statement earlier this month, the City does not like being disappointed by companies that are supposed to exceed expectations. </p> <p>The plunge in the share price may look harsh, given that sales are actually moving strongly up. However, it makes more sense than the precipitate rise that preceded it. </p> <p>Ted Baker's shares had soared from 135p when it was floated in the summer of 1997 to a peak of 535p last year. They may not have reached Matalan's dizzy valuation - at its peak it stood on 60 times its forecast earnings - but it was still roughly double the average rating for the general retailing sector. </p> <p>Such spectacular ratings must be justified by spectacular growth. If the growth seems to be faltering, so too must the rating. </p> <p>But a slowdown in growth affects more than just the rating. Ted Baker has been expanding rapidly on the assumption that rapid growth will continue. </p> <p>Take its new head office, the imaginatively named Ugly Brown Building, which includes space to display its collections and a rather grand restaurant which is, according to the finance director 'a bit more than a staff canteen'. </p> <p>Then there is a spanking new distribution warehouse, which it has yet to expand enough to fill. </p> <p>Then there is the cost of taking the brand into Europe and the US. </p> <p>Such costs were already taking their toll in the first half of the year: they wiped out the benefit of a 24 per cent rise in sales and meant that pre-tax profits fell by more than a quarter. </p> <p>The City was prepared to wear this - provided it looked as though profits were going to resume a growing trend. Ted Baker says that full-year profits will be ahead of last year's, despite a disappointing Christmas, albeit below the \u00a39 million analysts had been forecasting. </p> <p>Investors, however, are starting to question the growth story. </p> <p>That is entirely sensible - the wonder is that they did not do it before. Star retailer after star retailer - DFS Furniture, JJB Sports, John David Sports, and Electronics Boutique, not to mention older examples such as Tie Rack and Sock Shop - has demonstrated that gravity does eventually bring soaring sales down to earth. </p> <p>Buy them only if you are confident you can spot the right time to head for the door. </p> <p><strong> Small is beautiful</strong><br> </p> <p> Last year was another good year for small companies. A 2.8 per cent rise in the FTSE All Share index may not sound that exciting - and was well behind 1999, when the index surged by more than 50 per cent. But it was comfortably ahead of the market, as measured by the 8 per cent fall in the FTSE 100. </p> <p>Much of the difference can be attributed to one key feature of the small cap index: it includes virtually no telecoms stocks. </p> <p>Just three telecoms stocks - Vodafone, BT and Cable &amp; Wireless - make up 15 per cent of the FTSE 100 index. None of them exactly shone last year. </p> <p>There may not be many small telecoms companies, but there are plenty of other types of technology businesses in the index. If you include biotechnology stocks, the proportion is close to a fifth, compared with just 5 per cent for the FTSE 100. </p> <p>That explains the staggering outperformance of small caps in 1999, when tech stocks were all the rage. </p> <p>It also explains why the small cap index has risen by more than 4 per cent already this year, four times faster than the rest of the market. The cut in US interest rates helped markets generally, but it gave the technology sector in particular a real fillip. The Nasdaq has risen by a quarter since the start of the year. </p> <p>But technology shares are still not cheap by any conventional definition. And there is still no real evidence to show how a slowdown in the US economy will affect their performance. </p> <p>There is a real risk that the renewed optimism about the technology sector will prove just as misguided as the frenzy of buying in 1999. </p> <p>If so, the small cap sector could find it hard to outperform again this year. That does not mean investors should avoid the sector altogether. It does mean they should be careful what they buy. </p> <p><strong> Baan storming</strong><br> </p> <p> It is so long since Invensys produced any good news that the mere fact of a statement without a profits warning would have been greeted with relief. The fact that it described a bit of a recovery at Baan, the software engineer whose acquisition seemed to start Invensys' problems, was enough to send the shares soaring by more than 5 per cent. </p> <p>It would be wrong to get carried away, however. The 37 per cent rise in Baan's revenues in the three months to December compares with the previous quarter, when Baan's fortunes were at an all-time low. </p> <p>Compared with the same period in 1999, revenues are still around 25 per cent down and, as Invensys admits, 'the challenge remains to return sales to their historic high'. </p> <p>There are some encouraging signs. Allen Yurko, Invensys's chief executive, was confident that returning Baan to financial stability would be enough to help it win back business. </p> <p>That seems to be confirmed by the 162 new customers and 12 new contracts it has won since the deal was completed. Baan's performance has also been helped by the promised cost cuts, including the loss of 1,000 jobs. </p> <p>There is, however, still some way to go before Invensys can restore its credibility. For a start, investors will want to see what profits it can make from the increased revenues at Baan. </p> <p>Then there is the question of how the rest of the group is performing - an update on that will be given just before its March year-end. </p> <p>Invensys's shares have risen strongly since they touched 118p immediately following the profits warning last September. They are high enough for now.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Beware retailers who seem to defy gravity. That is the hard lesson that investors learnt first from Matalan but had reinforced last week by Ted Baker. Shares in the shirt-maker plunged by a quarter last week after it announced that its Christmas sales were up by 19 per cent. That is a better performance than most on the high street could dream of but it was below the expectations of management and, more importantly, the City. As Matalan learnt when it produced a similar statement earlier this month, the City does not like being disappointed by companies that are supposed to exceed expectations. The plunge in the share price may look harsh, given that sales are actually moving strongly up. However, it makes more sense than the precipitate rise that preceded it. Ted Baker's shares had soared from 135p when it was floated in the summer of 1997 to a peak of 535p last year. They may not have reached Matalan's dizzy valuation - at its peak it stood on 60 times its forecast earnings - but it was still roughly double the average rating for the general retailing sector. Such spectacular ratings must be justified by spectacular growth. If the growth seems to be faltering, so too must the rating. But a slowdown in growth affects more than just the rating. Ted Baker has been expanding rapidly on the assumption that rapid growth will continue. Take its new head office, the imaginatively named Ugly Brown Building, which includes space to display its collections and a rather grand restaurant which is, according to the finance director 'a bit more than a staff canteen'. Then there is a spanking new distribution warehouse, which it has yet to expand enough to fill. Then there is the cost of taking the brand into Europe and the US. Such costs were already taking their toll in the first half of the year: they wiped out the benefit of a 24 per cent rise in sales and meant that pre-tax profits fell by more than a quarter. The City was prepared to wear this - provided it looked as though profits were going to resume a growing trend. Ted Baker says that full-year profits will be ahead of last year's, despite a disappointing Christmas, albeit below the \u00a39 million analysts had been forecasting. Investors, however, are starting to question the growth story. That is entirely sensible - the wonder is that they did not do it before. Star retailer after star retailer - DFS Furniture, JJB Sports, John David Sports, and Electronics Boutique, not to mention older examples such as Tie Rack and Sock Shop - has demonstrated that gravity does eventually bring soaring sales down to earth. Buy them only if you are confident you can spot the right time to head for the door. Small is beautiful Last year was another good year for small companies. A 2.8 per cent rise in the FTSE All Share index may not sound that exciting - and was well behind 1999, when the index surged by more than 50 per cent. But it was comfortably ahead of the market, as measured by the 8 per cent fall in the FTSE 100. Much of the difference can be attributed to one key feature of the small cap index: it includes virtually no telecoms stocks. Just three telecoms stocks - Vodafone, BT and Cable &amp; Wireless - make up 15 per cent of the FTSE 100 index. None of them exactly shone last year. There may not be many small telecoms companies, but there are plenty of other types of technology businesses in the index. If you include biotechnology stocks, the proportion is close to a fifth, compared with just 5 per cent for the FTSE 100. That explains the staggering outperformance of small caps in 1999, when tech stocks were all the rage. It also explains why the small cap index has risen by more than 4 per cent already this year, four times faster than the rest of the market. The cut in US interest rates helped markets generally, but it gave the technology sector in particular a real fillip. The Nasdaq has risen by a quarter since the start of the year. But technology shares are still not cheap by any conventional definition. And there is still no real evidence to show how a slowdown in the US economy will affect their performance. There is a real risk that the renewed optimism about the technology sector will prove just as misguided as the frenzy of buying in 1999. If so, the small cap sector could find it hard to outperform again this year. That does not mean investors should avoid the sector altogether. It does mean they should be careful what they buy. Baan storming It is so long since Invensys produced any good news that the mere fact of a statement without a profits warning would have been greeted with relief. The fact that it described a bit of a recovery at Baan, the software engineer whose acquisition seemed to start Invensys' problems, was enough to send the shares soaring by more than 5 per cent. It would be wrong to get carried away, however. The 37 per cent rise in Baan's revenues in the three months to December compares with the previous quarter, when Baan's fortunes were at an all-time low. Compared with the same period in 1999, revenues are still around 25 per cent down and, as Invensys admits, 'the challenge remains to return sales to their historic high'. There are some encouraging signs. Allen Yurko, Invensys's chief executive, was confident that returning Baan to financial stability would be enough to help it win back business. That seems to be confirmed by the 162 new customers and 12 new contracts it has won since the deal was completed. Baan's performance has also been helped by the promised cost cuts, including the loss of 1,000 jobs. There is, however, still some way to go before Invensys can restore its credibility. For a start, investors will want to see what profits it can make from the increased revenues at Baan. Then there is the question of how the rest of the group is performing - an update on that will be given just before its March year-end. Invensys's shares have risen strongly since they touched 118p immediately following the profits warning last September. They are high enough for now.",

When measured in terms of national price levels (or purchasing power parities) the UK comes fifth behind Germany and Italy. </p> <p>More important to the debate about where we go from here with 'tax and spend' is that, out of annual national income, we in Britain spend more on personal consumption and less on health, education and investment than most other countries. The popular impression that there is less 'public squalor' across the Channel is borne out by the statistics. </p> <p>When it comes to what economists term 'the distribution of income' Marris finds: 'Well-paid people in Britain have more spending power than their continental counterparts, while people at the low end of the income scale are worse off than all except the Italians.'

City sources say Breare hopes to secure a board recommendation imminently. </p> <p>It is thought that Breare, who is backed by venture capitalist firm Botts, will share out the Wolves pubs with Enterprise Inns, the 2,600-strong leased and tenanted pub estate run by Ted Tuppen. Tuppen could take up to 1,000 Wolves' pubs at the bottom end of the retail estate. </p> <p>Breare would have the 700 best-managed pubs to add to Noble House Leisure, his restaurant company, which last November bought Oriental Restaurant Group. </p> <p>He will also keep hold of the best brewing assets owned by W&amp;D, especially the Pedigree brand, which is produced at Burton on Trent. W&amp;D has three other breweries: in Wolverhampton, Mansfield and Hartlepool. </p> <p>Breare's main competition is a management buyout led by David Thompson, which has secured backing.

      "bodyText": "Old Etonian Robert Breare will this week formally launch a bid for Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley, the UK's largest regional pubs and brewing business. The 47-year-old leisure entrepreneur will offer the Wolves board something under 500p a share, valuing the business at up to \u00a3465 million. City sources say Breare hopes to secure a board recommendation imminently. It is thought that Breare, who is backed by venture capitalist firm Botts, will share out the Wolves pubs with Enterprise Inns, the 2,600-strong leased and tenanted pub estate run by Ted Tuppen. Tuppen could take up to 1,000 Wolves' pubs at the bottom end of the retail estate. Breare would have the 700 best-managed pubs to add to Noble House Leisure, his restaurant company, which last November bought Oriental Restaurant Group. He will also keep hold of the best brewing assets owned by W&amp;D, especially the Pedigree brand, which is produced at Burton on Trent. W&amp;D has three other breweries: in Wolverhampton, Mansfield and Hartlepool. Breare's main competition is a management buyout led by David Thompson, which has secured backing. But that bid is not expected to beat Breare. If Breare, a Cambridge rowing blue, triumphs, the win will cap a six-month saga of offers, stand-offs and speculation. Wolves has been forced into a sale, having seen its shares crash from a high of 618.5p in 1999 to a low of 322p last summer. It announced a sale of the business to enhance shareholder value. Results have subsequently improved. Last December the company reported full-year profits of \u00a365m, up from \u00a350.2m. Turnover rose from \u00a3415.5m to \u00a3598.8m. There are already more than 5,000 pubs up for sale in Britain. Guy Hands' Principal Finance Group is favourite to scoop the 3,000 Whitbread pubs currently on the market. Bass is selling 900 units and Scottish &amp; Newcastle is ditching 740 of its 2,000-strong estate. Before his interest in Wolves, Breare's experience of the brewing sector amounted to a year spent as chief executive of InnSpired, the beer and pubs arm of Alchemy Partners, run by Jon Moulton, in 1999. Previously he worked in the publishing, hotel and hospitality sectors.",

      "body": "<p>A pre-election tax cutting bonanza looks to be off the agenda as a softening UK economy and acceleration in spending on public services puts the squeeze on the size of the Treasury's surplus. </p> <p>Though final figures will still hand Gordon Brown a surplus of many billions, its size is expected to be far closer to existing Treasury projections of \u00a310 billion than over-optimistic predictions by City analysts at November's pre-Budget report. </p> <p>Some predicted the Treasury would have an 'excess surplus' of another \u00a310bn, but now many have scaled back their predictions to an excess surplus of as little as \u00a31.75bn. </p> <p>'We always made it clear that it was premature to make speculative forecasts on the basis of just a few months' data,' said a Treasury spokesman. </p> <p>This limits the scope for cutting taxes without altering the fiscal stance. And were the Treasury to change the fiscal position, the Bank of England would be less likely to cut interest rates. </p> <p>Cautious Treasury assumptions about growth, world oil prices, and other external factors look to have been justified by a raft of weaker economic figures. </p> <p>Corporate profit warnings were up again in the last quarter of 2000, according to Ernst &amp; Young.

      "bodyText": "A pre-election tax cutting bonanza looks to be off the agenda as a softening UK economy and acceleration in spending on public services puts the squeeze on the size of the Treasury's surplus. Though final figures will still hand Gordon Brown a surplus of many billions, its size is expected to be far closer to existing Treasury projections of \u00a310 billion than over-optimistic predictions by City analysts at November's pre-Budget report. Some predicted the Treasury would have an 'excess surplus' of another \u00a310bn, but now many have scaled back their predictions to an excess surplus of as little as \u00a31.75bn. 'We always made it clear that it was premature to make speculative forecasts on the basis of just a few months' data,' said a Treasury spokesman. This limits the scope for cutting taxes without altering the fiscal stance. And were the Treasury to change the fiscal position, the Bank of England would be less likely to cut interest rates. Cautious Treasury assumptions about growth, world oil prices, and other external factors look to have been justified by a raft of weaker economic figures. Corporate profit warnings were up again in the last quarter of 2000, according to Ernst &amp; Young. The IT sector was particularly affected, accounting for 22 per cent of the 77 warnings. Similarly, Experian, the credit ratings company, will issue a devastating report on the profitability of British companies in the second quarter of last year. The return on capital employed by British companies fell by 11 per cent year on year, the fifth successive quarterly fall. This is the longest sustained period of declining profitability since the last recession. Such data means that tax revenues will not be as strong as expected. Matters are further complicated by the early receipt of revenues following a change to quarterly payment of corporate taxes. Set against a marked acceleration in public expenditure as government departments learn how to spend again, the slowdown reduces room for manoeuvre over any tax cuts. Along with Friday's unexpectedly low figure for fourth-quarter growth - 0.3 per cent - the developments are expected to tip the balance of the Monetary Policy Committee in favour of a rate cut. John Butler, UK economist at HSBC, says a rate cut next week is a 'done deal'. He also predicts that the Treasury will have only \u00a31.75bn 'excess' to play with, assuming the adoption of tax cuts on transport that are now under consultation. 'Although the current expectation is for an interest rate cut, the Government is already offering a substantial fiscal stimulus with the increase in public spending,' argues Martin Weale, director of the National Institute for Economic and Social Research.

      "body": "<p>It was bound to happen. Never mind. The Brass Monkey Investment Club had a good run for its money. With its shares worth \u00a328,000 in November 1999, the club changed strategy to get in on the technology boom. 'We rode the crest of the wave,' says club treasurer Mark Goodson. And how. On 4 January 2000 the value of the club's fund had risen to \u00a346,000. </p> <p>Unfortunately, the club was one of many UK investment clubs hit by the shake-out which saw the FTSE 100 end December 10 per cent lower on the year. 'In all the eupho ria, we forgot that the market can go the other way,' admits Goodson. Before Christmas, the value of the club's investments had fallen to \u00a336,000. </p> <p>Many other clubs forced to sit out the last few months of 2000 were hit hard. Some, however, bucked the trend. Elizabeth Swaloc's Investment Club, based in Toddington, Bedfordshire, began life in 1994. It lost money for the first two years, but since then its fortunes have been transformed. The club's portfolio, for which members paid \u00a343,500, is now worth \u00a362,000, and the FTSE's fall has passed it by almost unnoticed. </p> <p>'We are just not bothered by the FTSE and never have been,' says Dick Peake, the club's secretary. Last year saw prices of the club's shares in Amey plc rise by 62.4 per cent, those in Centrica by 47.7 per cent, and in Reliance Security by 44.7 per cent. Shares in Chime Communications and WSP were up 24.3 per cent and 23.0 per cent respectively. </p> <p>Even in the final four weeks of 2000, while stock markets were falling to a backdrop of worldwide dotcom doom and bust, six of the club's nine shares recorded price increases of between 4 and 12 per cent. Of the other three, even the worst performing, WSP, was down only 12 per cent. The only significant loss was \u00a3300 on shares in Umeco, bought in October. Peake dismisses it as 'not something we're going to worry about'. Even here the club may have the last laugh: the shares rose by 4.2 per cent in the final four weeks of the year. </p> <p>As well as seeing the value of their portfolio increase, the club's 20 members have had some fun along the way - even with tech stocks. They made a profit of \u00a34,000 on shares in DCS Group, which they originally bought at \u00a33.32 in February 1997. In March last year the shares' value had rocketed up to \u00a320. As of 15 December DCS was worth 92p. The club sold half at \u00a314.85, and half at \u00a36.90. 'Then we sat and laughed,' says Peake. All the way to the bank. </p> <p>The club's strategy has served it well. 'We look for growth stocks and prefer the smaller ones that nobody is talking about. Neither highly speculative nor boring blue chips,' says Peake. The club acts like a unit trust or an investment trust, and considers day trading to be totally unsuitable for investment clubs, which meet infrequently. As for new issues: 'We wouldn't touch a new issue - there is no track record.' </p> <p>The secret of share selection is to do your homework, says Peake. During the club's first two years they 'lost money like mad'. Shares were chosen because friends tipped them or simply because they were the first ones discussed at a meeting. </p> <p>Now, though mistakes are still made, they are small in relation to the overall portfolio. The club uses a panoply of systems and techniques to monitor the progress of individual shares. For example, a stop-loss mechanism requires members to meet when a price falls by more than 20 per cent so a decision can be made about whether to sell. </p> <p>'If the triggers are set off, we still need to decide whether it is the share or the market,' Peake says. 'If there is nothing wrong with the share, we will weather it out.'</p> <p><strong>Trading together</strong></p> <p>Investment clubs are booming. Around 4,500 were set up last year, bringing the total to about 10,000. Interest was fuelled by last year's dotcom shares bonanza, and appears to have survived their collapse. </p> <p>The clubs bring together people who pool modest amounts of money to trade on the stock market. The average monthly amount contributed is \u00a340, but some club ask less. Members of a new club usually pay a small lump sum towards the costs of setting up and starting to trade.</p> <p>Members meet regularly to decide what to buy and sell. ProShare, the group which promotes share ownership, recommends that clubs have a constitution, with rules on contribution levels, notice for withdrawing funds and how investments will be chosen. A Proshare manual on setting up a club, which includes a model constitution, is available for \u00a329.50 (tel: 0870 264 5484).</p> <p>Ten stockbroking firms offer special dealing rates to clubs; Barclays Stockbrokers offers a free copy of the Proshare manual to ones that use its service.</p>",

The with-profits method of distributing returns - 'smoothing' - has offered more security than other forms of equity investment, making it ideal for pensions and policies designed to repay mortgages. Returns are paid in bonuses and, to protect policyholders from the effects of poor stock market performance, some of the profits earned in good years are held over to boost bonuses in poor years. </p> <p>But the fact that Equitable's with-profits fund has run into trouble has called this investment style into question. Most commentators believe Equitable is a one-off, a life office with little in reserve to cover the cost of guaranteed annuities promised by its marketing department in past decades. But its situation has highlighted another problem shared by all with-profits funds - lack of clarity. </p> <p>Equitable policyholders have until now thought that the insurer was able to maintain high payouts and provide adequate security through consistently good investment performance. Now they have realised that Equitable's performance was actuallymiddle of the road, and it was only sustaining high payouts by distributing almost all the profits it generated. </p> <p>Up to now it has been impossible for an investor to know how much their with-profits fund has actually earned in any given year, what proportion of those returns is being distributed as bonuses or what the charges are. This has made it difficult for investors to judge whether they are investing with a financially secure life office. </p> <p>Tom McPhail, of independent financial adviser Torquil Clark, says: 'With-profits policies have often been sold as low-risk investments but they're not. At best they are medium-risk, and if you take it to an extreme, you get an Equitable, which delivers all its profits through annual bonuses and leaves itself with no reserves for security.' </p> <p>McPhail believes this opacity is no longer acceptable: 'People are much more interested in the bottom line, what they're being charged and what they're getting for their money. None of this is clear in with-profits.' </p> <p>Nick Bamford of Cranleigh independent financial adviser Informed Choice agrees: 'People are better-educated about financial products these days. They are more inclined to go for simple equity products such as unit trusts, Oeics and unit-linked insurance and pension funds.' </p> <p>Until now insurers have argued that bonuses and the smoothing process are too complicated for ordinary mortals to understand. </p> <p>But David White, chief executive of Tunbridge Wells Equitable, whose with-profits fund has consistently appeared at the top of payout league tables, says it has always been possible to tell policyholders exactly how much their policy has earned. 'The actuaries' reticence is about managing peoples' expectations,' he says. </p> <p>This attitude has also enabled insurers to manipulate the figures to suit their own ends, such as inflating bonuses to raise funds' ratings in league tables and attract new business. </p> <p>However, faced with increasing consumer dissatisfaction, they are finally beginning to provide more information. Britannic Retirement Solutions, a sub sidiary of Britannic Assurance, has just launched a with-profits annuity that will publish annual performance figures. It will provide policyholders with information about charges and how much money is being held over or paid out in the smoothing process each year. The insurer is considering extending this practice to other products. </p> <p>Norwich Union, which announced bonuses for the old Norwich Union, CGU (formerly General Accident) and CU with-profits funds last week, is intending to provide most of its with-profits policyholders with similar information this year. </p> <p>Is this new glasnost enough to restore with-profits sales? Nick Bamford believes there will always be demand for the security that properly managed with-profits funds can offer. 'There are lots of cautious people for whom with-profits will provide a good return.' </p> <p>But McPhail is not convinced: 'It's a process that's had its day.'</p>",

But David White, chief executive of Tunbridge Wells Equitable, whose with-profits fund has consistently appeared at the top of payout league tables, says it has always been possible to tell policyholders exactly how much their policy has earned. 'The actuaries' reticence is about managing peoples' expectations,' he says. This attitude has also enabled insurers to manipulate the figures to suit their own ends, such as inflating bonuses to raise funds' ratings in league tables and attract new business. However, faced with increasing consumer dissatisfaction, they are finally beginning to provide more information. Britannic Retirement Solutions, a sub sidiary of Britannic Assurance, has just launched a with-profits annuity that will publish annual performance figures. It will provide policyholders with information about charges and how much money is being held over or paid out in the smoothing process each year. The insurer is considering extending this practice to other products. Norwich Union, which announced bonuses for the old Norwich Union, CGU (formerly General Accident) and CU with-profits funds last week, is intending to provide most of its with-profits policyholders with similar information this year. Is this new glasnost enough to restore with-profits sales? Nick Bamford believes there will always be demand for the security that properly managed with-profits funds can offer. 'There are lots of cautious people for whom with-profits will provide a good return.' But McPhail is not convinced: 'It's a process that's had its day.'",

Inflation without mortgage repayments averaged 2.1 per cent in 2000, the lowest since the retail price index began in 1976. Tesco is charging 0.4 per cent less for its goods than it did 12 months ago and expects to drive prices even lower in 2001. You can buy a mobile phone for a tenth of what one cost two years ago. </p> <p>These figures show a pattern, according to most commentators. At the very least, the UK has fought off the old devil of high inflation. Some experts would go further, saying that global competition, technology and the internet have created a new economic environment which, if well-managed, gives little encouragement to high inflation. </p> <p>But others warn that we are on the verge of deflation. 'The real underlying rate of inflation is probably negative already,' says David Potter, former chairman of City banker Guinness Mahon.

      "bodyText": "Prices of shoes and clothing have fallen by an average of 3.8 per over the past year - the biggest drop since 1949. Inflation without mortgage repayments averaged 2.1 per cent in 2000, the lowest since the retail price index began in 1976. Tesco is charging 0.4 per cent less for its goods than it did 12 months ago and expects to drive prices even lower in 2001. You can buy a mobile phone for a tenth of what one cost two years ago. These figures show a pattern, according to most commentators. At the very least, the UK has fought off the old devil of high inflation. Some experts would go further, saying that global competition, technology and the internet have created a new economic environment which, if well-managed, gives little encouragement to high inflation. But others warn that we are on the verge of deflation. 'The real underlying rate of inflation is probably negative already,' says David Potter, former chairman of City banker Guinness Mahon. 'We're in a period of sea change from an inflationary to a deflationary environment. It's not necessarily frightening, but people aren't used to it.' If Potter is right, other statistics could look rather frightening. UK house prices recorded by the Halifax showed an average rise of 11.5 per cent in 1999, halving to 5.7 per cent in 2000 and forecast to slip to 4 per cent this year. After five years of growing by at least 10 per cent a year, the FTSE All Share index fell last year by 8 per cent. The British memory of deflation is unhappy. Most recently, thousands of people's lives were turned upside down when property prices fell dramatically in the late Eighties and early Nineties. Chris Lynas's job as fund manager of the top-performing S&amp;W Fixed Interest Fund, managed by accountant Smith &amp; Williamson, hinges on forecasting inflation and interest rates. He is not particularly concerned about deflation: 'It's probably far too early to be worrying too much about that. I don't think people need to do anything more now than those things which are common sense.' (See below) Like many commentators, his main global concern is whether the US economy is slowing down too fast. Even if it is, he believes the UK economy is robust enough to avoid being infected. The worst case scenario for this country, he believes, is 'asset price deflation', where house valuations, share prices and other major assets fall in value.

No request is too big or too small. So, if you're too harried to pick up your dry-cleaning, find better-value insurance, book train tickets, cook dinner for next Saturday's party or get that wedding anniversary present, your twenty-first- century Jeeves will do it all for you. You name it, apparently, and he or she will do it. At a price of course. </p> <p>Several 'lifestyle management' organisations exist, offering membership and a variety of services for between \u00a31,000 and \u00a31,500.

It advises people to shop around before buying travel cover, or risk paying 75 per cent more than they need. Screentrade, which allows customers to select the best deal available from a panel of insurance companies, warns that paying more does not necessarily mean getting better cover. Travel agents are often paid huge commissions for selling insurance; and so-called 'free' insurance is 'dubious' because the cost is often built into the price of a holiday. The broker says it can give its clients access to many deals which undercut the competition. Worst Isa named The worst-performing Isa has been Abbey Extra Income, according to a survey by independent financial adviser Chase de Vere. The best has been Solus UK Special Situations, Chase found. Abbey Extra Income turned a \u00a31,000 investment into just \u00a31,307 over a notional five years, while Solus UK returned \u00a34,571 on the same initial amount. Chase says the lessons are that savers should invest for at least 5 years, cut the risk by spreading their money over different areas of the world and avoid buying one specialist fund. Isas started in 1999, but can be assessed over longer periods because the underlying funds began earlier.

      "bodyText": "George and Carolyn Scott Ages 62 and 47 Live in Bristol Occupation Retired newsagents Earn Occupational pension Mortgage None Debts None Investments None Pensions Occupational pensions Aim To invest proceeds of selling business and home George and Carolyn Scott have sold their newsagent's business in Bristol and are retiring to France. They have visited it several times a year, have English and French friends there and George speaks the language fluently. So they have sold their home as well as the business and bought a house near Cahors. They emigrate in June, when Carolyn's youngest daughter leaves school. They have no plans yet for what they may do in France, although George says: 'I will try to do as little work as possible. At 62, I have been a newsagent for nine years and I thought, \"Someone else can have a go\".' But Carolyn, 47, may look for work in France. Neither do they know what their living expenses will be, although they expect to live modestly. Their outgoings will mainly be household expenses and tax. The new house is in good condition. Their income initially will be George's pension from a previous job in the National Health Service: an index-linked \u00a39,000 a year. Carolyn is still contributing \u00a3165 a month to a personal pension. But they have no other savings: 'We used any spare money over the years to pay off mortgages and debts. We took the view that we could do better by avoiding paying interest rates than in safe investments.' The house in France was paid for outright before they sold the business: 'After all fees and disbursements, and buying a new car, we have \u00a3140,000 to invest 'on a cautious, low-risk basis because of my age', he says. We want advice on how to increase our income while maintaining our capital to allow for inflation.' They want to know whether to invest in France and/or offshore, given the current exchange rate. He asks: 'Do we have any discretion about which regime we are taxed under and, if so, which is the better one?' Adviser 1: Donna Bradshaw When the Scotts become resident in France, they will be liable to the same taxes as French nationals. They will have to pay income tax on their UK income, although a double taxation agreement between the UK and France means that they will not be charged twice over. Personal taxation in France is higher than in the UK, and the personal allowance is lower, which means they will start paying tax at modest levels of income, although this is offset by lower costs of living. The French are taxed as household units, so their incomes are added together and divided by the number of people in the family. An offshore investment bond could be suitable for their capital, denominated in euros to eliminate currency risk. Although there is a fee, they should set this up in trust to minimise tax. Regular withdrawals can be taken from the bond to provide income; I suggest 5 per cent a year of the original investment. The bond should be put in place before they declare themselves tax resident in France, which they do not have to do until January 2002. George should get a forecast of his British state pension, as it is likely to contribute significantly to his overall income. It can be paid gross, directly to a French bank account. They will have to pay into the French social fund, which covers healthcare, until they reach French state pension age. Donna Bradshaw works for London-based Fiona Price &amp; Partners. Adviser 2: Carolyn Corless Carolyn will have to stop making pension contributions once they move, and they should both consider using capital to fund pension contributions based on their unused UK tax relief The ability to carry forward unused relief will be abolished at the end of this tax year, although the ability to 'carry back' continues for another year. They should arrange an offshore account to take income from pensions and investments. Bristol &amp; West's Easy Plus Offshore (2) pays 7 per cent gross on \u00a310,000. They will need an account in France, to which money can be transferred from offshore. The Scotts need to clarify their tax position before deciding where to invest. Although they want to be cautious, they should consider equity-based investments to be sure of keep ing pace with inflation. They need to prepare for a drop in pension if George dies first. She would need a relatively high level of income from the capital, so investing for growth now is essential. Offshore unit trusts and investment bonds provide a balance without undue risk, and a gross overall yield of about 4 per cent is reasonable. The French National Health Service works differently from ours, and the Scotts should check whether and to what it extent it will cover them. Otherwise, they should consider health insurance. They should read the Inland Revenue guide IR20 'Residents and non-residents' and must take specialist advice when they arrive in France.

      "body": "<p>Lenders make most money by charging their standard variable rate (SVA). This is normally between 2 and 3 per cent above the Bank of England base rate for lending, and can be changed in line with that rate. </p> <p>It is worth bearing in mind the way a lender treats existing customers paying the SVR if you are considering applying for a new mortgage. You will, after all, become an existing customer when your special deal expires. </p> <p>Many lenders follow the example of the Halifax, the UK's biggest lender, by setting their SVR at the higher end of the scale. But some have tried to retain existing borrowers or to prove the benefits of mutuality by charging less. HSBC, for example, now charges 6.75 per cent, while the Nationwide building society standard rate is 7.09 per cent. </p> <p>Even so, you may be able to save by switching to one of the following special deals: </p> <p> <strong> Fixed rate</strong> </p> <p> The interest rate is fixed for a predetermined period, usually between two and five years. Once this ends, you pay the lender's SVR. </p> <p>Advantages: This is good for people who are living on a tight budget and can't afford to see their monthly payment rise. </p> <p>Disadvantages: If interest rates fall, you may miss out on a cut in your monthly payments. You usually have to pay early redemption penalties if you end the loan during the fixed period, and particularly cheap rate loans may have penalties that extend beyond that, tying you to paying the lender's SVR. </p> <p> <strong> Discounted</strong> </p> <p> The interest rate is discounted from the lender's SVR by a certain amount for a predetermined number of years. Your payments will move up or down in line with any changes to the SVR. </p> <p>Advantages: If interest rates fall, you should benefit from lower payments. </p> <p>Disadvantages: If interest rates rise, your payments could go up, so these loans are not suitable for anyone who really can't afford to pay any extra. The conditions attached to discounted mortgages usually include early redemption penalties during the discounted period, and these may extend beyond the discount if the loan is particularly cheap. </p> <p> <strong> Capped rate</strong> </p> <p> The top rate you pay is fixed, or 'capped', at a certain level for a set time. But if interest rates fall during that time, your monthly payments should fall in line with any changes to the lender's SVR. It is less commonly available than fixed or discounted loans. </p> <p>Advantages: Good for someone on a limited budget, enabling them to benefit from base rate falls but protecting them from rises. </p> <p>Disadvantages: Lenders can be tardy in passing on the benefit in base rate cuts. Early redemption penalties during the capped period, and beyond for competitive loans. </p> <p> <strong> Tracker</strong> </p> <p> The interest rate is set at a predetermined level above or below the Bank of England base rate, rising and falling in line with any changes during the tracking period. </p> <p>Advantages: Similar to a discounted loan: if base rates fall, the amount you pay falls. There are often no early redemption penalties. </p> <p>Disadvantages: Likewise, if rates go up, so will your payments. </p> <p> <strong> Cashback</strong> </p> <p> Borrowers are paid a lump sum of cash on completion. </p> <p>Advantages: Upfront cash can be very useful for people who want to make alterations to their homes. </p> <p>Disadvantages: Interest is charged at the lender's SVR.

      "bodyText": "Lenders make most money by charging their standard variable rate (SVA). This is normally between 2 and 3 per cent above the Bank of England base rate for lending, and can be changed in line with that rate. It is worth bearing in mind the way a lender treats existing customers paying the SVR if you are considering applying for a new mortgage. You will, after all, become an existing customer when your special deal expires. Many lenders follow the example of the Halifax, the UK's biggest lender, by setting their SVR at the higher end of the scale. But some have tried to retain existing borrowers or to prove the benefits of mutuality by charging less. HSBC, for example, now charges 6.75 per cent, while the Nationwide building society standard rate is 7.09 per cent. Even so, you may be able to save by switching to one of the following special deals: Fixed rate The interest rate is fixed for a predetermined period, usually between two and five years. Once this ends, you pay the lender's SVR. Advantages: This is good for people who are living on a tight budget and can't afford to see their monthly payment rise. Disadvantages: If interest rates fall, you may miss out on a cut in your monthly payments. You usually have to pay early redemption penalties if you end the loan during the fixed period, and particularly cheap rate loans may have penalties that extend beyond that, tying you to paying the lender's SVR. Discounted The interest rate is discounted from the lender's SVR by a certain amount for a predetermined number of years. Your payments will move up or down in line with any changes to the SVR. Advantages: If interest rates fall, you should benefit from lower payments. Disadvantages: If interest rates rise, your payments could go up, so these loans are not suitable for anyone who really can't afford to pay any extra. The conditions attached to discounted mortgages usually include early redemption penalties during the discounted period, and these may extend beyond the discount if the loan is particularly cheap. Capped rate The top rate you pay is fixed, or 'capped', at a certain level for a set time. But if interest rates fall during that time, your monthly payments should fall in line with any changes to the lender's SVR. It is less commonly available than fixed or discounted loans. Advantages: Good for someone on a limited budget, enabling them to benefit from base rate falls but protecting them from rises. Disadvantages: Lenders can be tardy in passing on the benefit in base rate cuts. Early redemption penalties during the capped period, and beyond for competitive loans. Tracker The interest rate is set at a predetermined level above or below the Bank of England base rate, rising and falling in line with any changes during the tracking period. Advantages: Similar to a discounted loan: if base rates fall, the amount you pay falls. There are often no early redemption penalties. Disadvantages: Likewise, if rates go up, so will your payments. Cashback Borrowers are paid a lump sum of cash on completion. Advantages: Upfront cash can be very useful for people who want to make alterations to their homes. Disadvantages: Interest is charged at the lender's SVR. These loans have long early redemption periods - you might have to pay penalties to get out for up to six or seven years after taking out the loan, tying you into the lender's standard rate for a very long time.",

For homeowners, a review of mortgage costs should be next. Millions of us are paying hundreds, if not thousands, of pounds too much every year. </p> <p>'Anyone who is paying their lender's standard variable rate is paying over the odds, and many people with special rate offers could save money by switching,' says David Hollingworth, of Bath independent mortgage brokerLondon &amp; Country. </p> <p>Most lenders, including Halifax and Abbey National, are charging a standard variable rate (SVR) of 7.74 per cent now. But it's possible to find loans with interest fixed as low as 5.49 per cent for two years, or discounted by 3 per cent, 2 per cent and 1 per cent in successive years. </p> <p>A homeowner with a \u00a3100,000 standard variable rate interest-only mortgage could save \u00a32,250 a year by switching to the fixed rate, and \u00a33,000, \u00a32,000 and \u00a31,000 (assuming the SVR remains the same) by taking the discounted loan. </p> <p>Compared with the agony of taking out a mortgage when buying a new home, remortgaging is relatively simple and painless. There's no need to pay stamp duty, and lenders are so keen to get your custom that in many cases they will pay your legal costs and valuation fees. If you remortgage with your existing lender, you don't even need the valuation or conveyancying. A lawyer (usually provided by the new lender) simply needs to register the change of lender with the Land Registry. </p> <p>The whole business can easily be completed in six weeks - and even if it takes a while longer, there's no need to worry. You are not in a race to beat other buyers, and a delay won't cost you the home of your dreams. </p> <p>Some lenders are encouraging their existing customers to remortgage. It is cheaper for them to retain borrowers, even on lower interest rates, than to pull in new customers. </p> <p>However, it might not be that much cheaper for you. The Halifax is contacting all customers paying its standard variable rate to see if they are interested in switching to another deal. This offer is good value for borrowers locked into the Halifax by early redemption penalties, as the lender is allowing them to sit out their remaining redemption period while benefiting from a lower interest rate. But Ray Boulger of London independent mortgage broker Charcol says those who are not subject to penalties can undoubtedly find better rates with other lenders. 'As with all financial products, it's important to shop around,' he says. </p> <p>So how do you work out if a fresh deal will save you money?</p> <p>First, find out what interest rate you are paying and whether you face redemption penalties if you remortgage. These charges are either presented as a percentage of the loan, or as a number of months' interest. The easy way to discover the cost is to ask your lender for a redemption statement, which should set out any penalties. </p> <p>You then need to compare the penalties to any savings you would make over a comparable period. For example, someone whose special rate deal has expired and is now paying the lender's SVR of 7.74 per cent would pay \u00a315,480 in interest if rates stay at current levels (7.74 per cent multiplied by \u00a3100,000 multiplied by two years). Let's say this borrower faces redemption penalties of 5 per cent or \u00a35,000 for a further two years. If he is considering switching to the 5.49 per cent fixed-rate mortgage mentioned above, he would have to pay \u00a310,980 in interest over the next two years (5.49 per cent multiplied by \u00a3100,000 multiplied by two years). To this you must add the \u00a35,000 in penalties, bringing the total cost to \u00a315,980 - \u00a3500 more than he would pay on the SVR. </p> <p>It's important to include all costs in this calculation. If the new lender makes an administration charge - usually in the region of \u00a3300 - or does not offer to cover the cost of a valuation (about \u00a3200) or legal fees (expect to pay \u00a3300), the borrower could end up further out of pocket by remortgaging. </p> <p>Once you've found a mortgage that will save you a worthwhile amount of money, you can help smooth the process by assembling any necessary information as soon as possible. This will include a P60 certificate of pay and tax deducted, recent payslips, your last mortgage statement and sometimes an employer's reference.</p> <p><strong>Happy saving \u00a31,800</strong></p> <p>Phil and Tracey Harding will save more than \u00a31,800 over the next two years by remortgaging. </p> <p>The Hampshire couple borrowed a discounted tracker loan from the Newcastle building society, but the discount was ending, leaving them to pay 0.75 per cent above the Bank of England base rate - currently 6.75 per cent. The monthly repayments on their \u00a374,000 interest-only loan would have been \u00a3416.25 (6.75 per cent multiplied by \u00a374,000 divided by 12 months).</p> <p>Phil, who works as a development technician for McLaren sports cars, says: 'I wasn't prepared to pay that. I've got a young family so I've got to watch where the money goes.'</p> <p>His existing mortgage had no early redemption penalties, so with the help of London &amp; Country Mortgages, Phil chose a Coventry building society loan discounted by 2.2 per cent from the lender's standard variable rate (now 7.7 per cent) for two years. This will cost \u00a3339 a month (5.5 per cent multiplied by \u00a374,000 divided by 12 months). The offer included a free valuation, free basic legal work and, again, no redemption penalties, so the Hardings can again remortgage at the end of the discounted period if it saves them money. Coventry charged a completion fee of \u00a3195, which was added on to the loan.</p> <p>The whole process was simple and stress free. 'A colleague gave me London &amp; Country's number, I gave them our details and they did the rest. It's taken about three months, but it would have been quicker but for a delay by the solicitors [provided by Coventry BS].'</p> <p><strong>Flexing their borrowing muscle </strong></p> <p>Remortgaging has allowed Peter and Mary Devlin to pay off an overdraft and a car loan, and buy income replacement cover. And because they chose a flexible mortgage, they expect to pay off the extra raised to pay off the debts in two years. </p> <p>They had a \u00a3121,000 interest-only loan from Bank of Ireland, benefiting from a couple of special rate offers. But their last discount expired, leaving them on BoI's standard variable rate of 7.75 per cent. Their monthly payments were \u00a3781, plus \u00a365 for associated policies.</p> <p>'I thought we were paying too much, and there was no flexibility,' says Peter. Remortgaging made sense as the couple, who have three children, had built up debts costing \u00a3330 a month. Peter, who is approaching age 44, also wanted an income replacement policy.</p> <p>On the advice of mortgage broker Charcol, the couple switched to the Woolwich Open Plan, a flexible mortgage that allows you to repay chunks of your mortgage early, overpay your monthly premiums, and draw out money you have paid into your mortgage account. The Devlins increased the loan to \u00a3138,000 to incorporate their debts, leaving \u00a3121,000 on an interest-only basis and setting up the extra \u00a317,000 as a repayment loan. But as the loan was discounted by 2 per cent for two years, their monthly outgoings of \u00a3689 plus \u00a3138 for life insurance were about the same as their previous mortgage - without the cost of the debts.</p> <p>A wide range of flexible loans allow you to repay early without penalty (see table on page 2); some also allow you to draw out money and take payment holidays. Whichever you choose, check that it calculates interest daily. Interest on many Halifax flexible loans is adjusted annually, and borrowers will benefit immediately only from overpayments in excess of \u00a3250.</p> <p>A few lenders - again Woolwich, Virgin and Intelligent Finance - take flexibility a step further by incorporating current and savings accounts, credit cards and personal loans. Any income is offset against borrowings on a daily basis, effectively reducing the amount a borrower owes, and hence the interest they pay.</p>",

Higher heating costs, the overindulgence of Christmas and the temptation posed by the January sales see to that. </p> <p>But a significant number of us may be dealing with more than just gas bills and turkeys when it comes to keeping spending in check during the colder and, more importantly, darker months. </p> <p>There is a growing awareness that lack of sunlight can have a profound influence on our mental state. In its most extreme form it is known as Sad - Seasonal Affective Disorder. Decreased exposure to sunshine influences the chemistry of the brain, which in turn can affect mental state - profoundly in some cases. </p> <p>Between 3 and 5 per cent of the population may suffer full-scale Sad, leading to severe depression and lethargy. But as many as 90 per cent of us may suffer from some form of winter blues. It is the winter blues sufferers - rather than those with severe Sad - who are more likely to have difficulty in controlling spending. </p> <p>According to biological psychologist Dr Lance Workman of the University of Glamorgan, clinically depressed Sad sufferers simply would not feel up to going out and spending. </p> <p>'People with full-blown Sad don't go out of the house unless they have to,' he says. 'They would be more likely to let their spend get out of control in the summer, when they can become quite hyper. But if you're talking about winter blues, it's quite possible this would affect your spending.' </p> <p>People tend to put on weight in winter, and this can affect their self-image and mood and possibly make them spend money to feel better. </p> <p>'If you do put on a few pounds in the winter, try not to worry about it,' says Workman. In fact stodgy food boosts serotonin levels, so - in moderation - may fight the winter blues. It also helps to eat fresh fruit, particularly bananas. These are rich in potassium, which can help depression. </p> <p>According to Ann Macaskill of Sheffield Hallam University, the most critical thing is to get outside during the daylight hours - particularly when it is sunny - and, ideally, combine this with exercise. </p> <p>Try to sit near a window when inside. If you have to go shopping, do so in the high street, not indoor shopping centres. While light therapy is a treatment for Sad, a course of sunbed treatments won't help as that doesn't offer full-spectrum light. </p> <p>Winter spending blues could take the form of simple lethargy preventing you dealing promptly with bills and statements, through to frequent and often regretted 'comfort' purchases. </p> <p>'I haven't got any statistical evidence, but anecdotally you see cases where people are less able to cope in the winter months,' said Sophie Brookes of National Debtline. 'I know from my own point of view that if you've had a hard day at the office and you come out and it's dark and rainy you're more likely to go off and treat yourself to a CD to cheer yourself up.' </p> <p>If you think the weather may influence your spending patterns and ability to deal with financial matters, start by looking at your monthly credit card bills and bank statements. </p> <p>You would expect a post-Christmas blip but does your financial management worsen as the bad weather sets in and the days get shorter and darker? </p> <p>According to Meteorological Office statistics, we benefited from just 1.51 hours of sunshine a day on average in December, compared with 6.06 hours in August. </p> <p>Sunlight hours start to decrease significantly from October, at three hours a day, going down to just 2.08 hours on average in November. If your spending is truly getting out of hand, seek help and advice, but a mild case of winter blues should be treatable with self-help. </p> <p>Brookes suggests shopping around for a credit card with a better rate of interest and limiting your comforting spending - perhaps to a treat once a month up to a pre-set limit. </p> <p>'It's a bit like dieting,' she said. Work out your monthly budget after bills have been accounted for, and stick to it. </p> <p>'The weather generally affects mood,' confirms psychologist Michael Argyle. 'We're more cheerful when the sun is shining and less so when it rains. This can affect a number of things, including our spending.' </p> <p>Argyle recommends that people prone to overspending when the weather is grim should leave their credit cards at home. This may make more sense than taking an umbrella out with them.</p>",

According to biological psychologist Dr Lance Workman of the University of Glamorgan, clinically depressed Sad sufferers simply would not feel up to going out and spending. 'People with full-blown Sad don't go out of the house unless they have to,' he says. 'They would be more likely to let their spend get out of control in the summer, when they can become quite hyper. But if you're talking about winter blues, it's quite possible this would affect your spending.' People tend to put on weight in winter, and this can affect their self-image and mood and possibly make them spend money to feel better. 'If you do put on a few pounds in the winter, try not to worry about it,' says Workman. In fact stodgy food boosts serotonin levels, so - in moderation - may fight the winter blues. It also helps to eat fresh fruit, particularly bananas. These are rich in potassium, which can help depression. According to Ann Macaskill of Sheffield Hallam University, the most critical thing is to get outside during the daylight hours - particularly when it is sunny - and, ideally, combine this with exercise. Try to sit near a window when inside. If you have to go shopping, do so in the high street, not indoor shopping centres. While light therapy is a treatment for Sad, a course of sunbed treatments won't help as that doesn't offer full-spectrum light. Winter spending blues could take the form of simple lethargy preventing you dealing promptly with bills and statements, through to frequent and often regretted 'comfort' purchases. 'I haven't got any statistical evidence, but anecdotally you see cases where people are less able to cope in the winter months,' said Sophie Brookes of National Debtline. 'I know from my own point of view that if you've had a hard day at the office and you come out and it's dark and rainy you're more likely to go off and treat yourself to a CD to cheer yourself up.' If you think the weather may influence your spending patterns and ability to deal with financial matters, start by looking at your monthly credit card bills and bank statements. You would expect a post-Christmas blip but does your financial management worsen as the bad weather sets in and the days get shorter and darker? According to Meteorological Office statistics, we benefited from just 1.51 hours of sunshine a day on average in December, compared with 6.06 hours in August. Sunlight hours start to decrease significantly from October, at three hours a day, going down to just 2.08 hours on average in November. If your spending is truly getting out of hand, seek help and advice, but a mild case of winter blues should be treatable with self-help. Brookes suggests shopping around for a credit card with a better rate of interest and limiting your comforting spending - perhaps to a treat once a month up to a pre-set limit. 'It's a bit like dieting,' she said. Work out your monthly budget after bills have been accounted for, and stick to it. 'The weather generally affects mood,' confirms psychologist Michael Argyle. 'We're more cheerful when the sun is shining and less so when it rains. This can affect a number of things, including our spending.' Argyle recommends that people prone to overspending when the weather is grim should leave their credit cards at home. This may make more sense than taking an umbrella out with them.",

Aides are reported to be 'livid' that the final curtain on the Clinton epoch was hallmarked not by an epic moment but by the kind of sleaze that marked the flip-side of the Presidency. Hillary Clinton - now a Senator in New York - was reported to have gone to ground after Congress launched an investigation into last-minute White House pardons to her political donors and supporters. The former President was also stewing in criticism of his undignified exit after his staff adopted a scorched earth policy leaving the White House. Apart from President Bush and his supporters, few people were left unimpressed by Bill Clinton's defiant and cheeky departure from Washington last inaugural Saturday, and his speech in which he left the capital in a flagrant breach of protocol promising: 'I'm still around; I ain't going nowhere.'

      "body": "<p>Bag Wahab was one of the unlucky ones. On Friday the 26-year-old Turk sat in the arrivals area at Sarajevo airport, surrounded by police, his head bowed, close to tears. An agricultural labourer and father of two children, he had sold his land and spent all his savings to enter Europe as an illegal migrant.</p> <p>Wahab fell at the first hurdle. As dozens of young men with similar ambitions passed through immigration into Bosnia, jumping-off point for the 'Sarajevo Route' into the EU, Wahab's lack of education let him down. He thought he was arriving in a country called Sarajevo, at a capital called Grozny. The State Border Service informed him he would be sent home.</p> <p>Like dozens of other young men from Tunisia and Turkey who had passed through, their tickets and passports in order, and with sufficient cash to be allowed to stay, Wahab had said he was a tourist. Sitting in a corner of the departures lounge, his journey over, he abandoned the dissimulation. 'I was trying to get to France to work,' he told The Observer. 'I've already spent most of my money paying a commission to come in. Now what I am going to do? What is going to happen to me?'</p> <p>Wahab is the exception rather than the rule. Half an hour later the others who arrived from Istanbul with him were heading for an unofficial rank of cabs that pull up on a verge just outside the airport compound on the days the Turkish flight comes in, specifically to carry migrants. Where they are taken next is Sarajevo's biggest open secret. Those not taken by van or taxi immediately to the Croatian border will spend a few days in a hotel, among them the Alemko, a low, dilapidated, purple building not far from the city centre. The Orijent and Palas hotels are also favourites with the criminal gangs running the people-smuggling rackets.</p> <p>Their next step was revealed by a surveillance operation set up by officers of the International Police Task Force in Sarajevo in December, who tracked three groups of migrants to small hotels and safe houses close to the international borders they will cross by foot, in boats across the Sava river, or even in the back of empty fuel tanker lorries specially equipped with benches, all of them en route for Fortress Europe.</p> <p>Wahab and the other young men who arrived on Friday are the willing victims of the world's fastest-growing crime, a trade that the International Organisation for Migration calculates is worth upwards of \u00a370 million a year in Bosnia alone. Worldwide, the UN estimates, the smugglers earned around \u00a34 billion in the past 12 months alone. Coming to Bosnia is not a crime. But what they will try to do when they are here is definitely illegal. And few have any doubt that the smuggling of migrants is being aided through Bosnia by police and politicians at the highest level.</p> <p>According to Geoffrey Beaumont, coordinator of the UN's project to set up a functioning Bosnian State Border Service, more than 10 per cent of the half million illegal migrants who reached the EU last year came via the Bosnian route. And although Croatia has been catching up to 5,000 of them a year, few are in any doubt that, deported back to Bosnia, most will try again. By their third attempt officials believe most will have crossed into Europe proper.</p> <p>It is a route fast becoming one of the biggest headaches for the EU. Last week European Commissioner Chris Patten announced extra aid for training Bosnian and other Balkan police forces in the fight against migrant-smuggling after it was raised by EU Foreign Ministers.</p> <p>The announcement comes against a background of a rising sense of crisis in the EU over illegal migration which has increased more than tenfold in the past 10 years. Across Europe arrests at borders are rocketing, as are asylum applications across the 15 nations.</p> <p>In Bosnia the traffic in illegal migrants conceals a second, more venal trade in humans: the trade in sex slaves which lures women and young girls to Bosnia 'mainly from Eastern Europe and former Soviet republics' with the promise of jobs as au pairs or waitresses in the EU.</p> <p>In one of the most shocking cases, uncovered last summer, 12 women and young girls were found locked in a darkened room in a bar in the town of Prijedor, where they had been held and repeatedly raped.</p> <p>According to officials who dealt with the case, the horror of the original discovery was quickly overtaken by a sense of impotence as corrupt local officials frustrated their efforts to prosecute those involved. 'We had to move the women four times in 10 days to different secret safe houses because the traffickers kept turning up outside,' says Fredric Larrson, programme manager with the International Organisation for Migration in Sarajevo.</p> <p>Their persistence paid off. Faced with constant harassment, four of the five women prepared to testify against the slavers withdrew their evidence and the case collapsed. International officials have no question about how the women were so easily found. 'We have very strong indications,' said one official familiar with the case, 'that the authorities collude in both the trafficking of people and smuggling in illegal immigrants at the very highest level.'</p> <p>The case of the Prijedor women, say officials, is simply the starkest evidence of the difficulties they face in trying to stamp out human trafficking in Bosnia: the large-scale involvement of corrupt politicians and police. Prosecutions have been almost non-existent for both crimes; detection is hampered by those willing to help the people-smugglers.</p> <p>Among those named to The Observer by international officials as suspected of benefiting from the trade in migrants is the son of one of Bosnia's most respected figures. One senior official said: 'His company was organising special charter flights full of Iranians last year who simply disappeared. Do I think he is involved? I believe at least that he has benefited from it. The truth,' he continued, 'is that this is being encouraged by corruption at the very highest levels.'</p> <p>Evidence exists too that the smuggling business is part of a sophisticated international network that supplies forged documents as well. In some cases the trail leads to Britain.</p> <p>Late last year, say international police, a package was intercepted from London addressed to an Iranian woman renting accommodation in Sarajevo. Instead of the CDs it claimed to contain, the package was stuffed with stolen European passports.</p> <p>The shocking reality of Bosnia today, international officials say, is this. Five years after the Dayton Peace Agreement was signed to bring a genocidal war to an end, a country that has received unprecedented military and economic aid from the international community has turned, not into a model Balkan democracy, but into one of Europe's main hubs for smuggling people.</p> <p>'It is depressing as hell,' said one official. 'Almost half the people in Sarajevo depend on the international community for their income, but we can't persuade the authorities to stamp it out. It would be easy if the international community was really bothered. We could simply say stop this or we stop the aid.'</p> <p>It is a threat already levelled against Yugoslavia, blamed for years under the Milosevic regime of being the main conduit of Chinese migrants into Europe. Late last year the EU told President Vojislav Kostunica that aid to his country is contingent on him closing the door to the tens of thousands of Chinese illegal immigrants using Belgrade as a first stop on their route into the EU.</p> <p>It is a solution many international officials believe should be applied to shock Bosnia's corrupt politicians out of their complacency. But they do not blame Bosnia alone. 'We are very concerned over what Europe is going to do about this problem,' says Geoffrey Beaumont. 'They say they are worried about this, but is their solution to seal off Bosnia from Europe?'</p> <p>So far, he concedes, there is little danger of that. The State Border Service he is helping to set up is 'so far working at only four of Bosnia's 400-odd border crossings. International funding for the project has been woeful. At present we have a budget of around \u00a36 million to control all of Bosnia's borders. If Europe was serious about controlling this problem all it would cost the individual governments would be around \u00a33m a year. That must be cheaper than the money that they are spending on detecting, arresting, holding and returning illegal refugees. So far the only people who are really trying hard on this issue are the Germans and the Dutch.'</p> <p>The alternative is a solution that is quickly becoming the EU's most controversial issue: a proposed scheme of managed migration into Europe via quotas and a 'green card' entry scheme similar to that in the US. Floated last December in a European Commission communication, it calls for a Europe-wide asylum and immigration policy that would abandon three decades of a zero migration policy in response to predictions of a declining and ageing European population that will need mass migration to sustain its economic life.</p> <p>What that would mean, according to the EU justice and home affairs Commissioner, Antonio Vitorino, involved in drawing up the paper, is a policy aimed at trebling legal migration to almost one million by 2004.</p> <p>But despite evidence collected by the Commission, the idea of a permit system for unskilled labourers like Wahab is unlikely to be smiled on by politicians in Britain or elsewhere. For although Britain's Home Office Minister, Barbara Roche, has been persuaded of the need to attract skilled migrants, no one has been persuaded of the case of those at the bottom of the ladder. It is a contradiction that has been noted by Sarah Spencer, director of the Citizenship and Governance programme of the Institute for Public Policy Research, who has been advising the Home Office on any change to its migration policy.</p> <p>'One of the questions that has yet to be addressed is that, if we had legal channels into Britain and Europe, would it reduce the pressure to come in and dissuade people from going to the smugglers? That is a very sensitive issue. At the moment we have got a consensus that we need skilled labourers.

      "bodyText": "Bag Wahab was one of the unlucky ones. On Friday the 26-year-old Turk sat in the arrivals area at Sarajevo airport, surrounded by police, his head bowed, close to tears. An agricultural labourer and father of two children, he had sold his land and spent all his savings to enter Europe as an illegal migrant. Wahab fell at the first hurdle. As dozens of young men with similar ambitions passed through immigration into Bosnia, jumping-off point for the 'Sarajevo Route' into the EU, Wahab's lack of education let him down. He thought he was arriving in a country called Sarajevo, at a capital called Grozny. The State Border Service informed him he would be sent home. Like dozens of other young men from Tunisia and Turkey who had passed through, their tickets and passports in order, and with sufficient cash to be allowed to stay, Wahab had said he was a tourist. Sitting in a corner of the departures lounge, his journey over, he abandoned the dissimulation. 'I was trying to get to France to work,' he told The Observer. 'I've already spent most of my money paying a commission to come in. Now what I am going to do? What is going to happen to me?' Wahab is the exception rather than the rule. Half an hour later the others who arrived from Istanbul with him were heading for an unofficial rank of cabs that pull up on a verge just outside the airport compound on the days the Turkish flight comes in, specifically to carry migrants. Where they are taken next is Sarajevo's biggest open secret. Those not taken by van or taxi immediately to the Croatian border will spend a few days in a hotel, among them the Alemko, a low, dilapidated, purple building not far from the city centre. The Orijent and Palas hotels are also favourites with the criminal gangs running the people-smuggling rackets. Their next step was revealed by a surveillance operation set up by officers of the International Police Task Force in Sarajevo in December, who tracked three groups of migrants to small hotels and safe houses close to the international borders they will cross by foot, in boats across the Sava river, or even in the back of empty fuel tanker lorries specially equipped with benches, all of them en route for Fortress Europe. Wahab and the other young men who arrived on Friday are the willing victims of the world's fastest-growing crime, a trade that the International Organisation for Migration calculates is worth upwards of \u00a370 million a year in Bosnia alone. Worldwide, the UN estimates, the smugglers earned around \u00a34 billion in the past 12 months alone. Coming to Bosnia is not a crime. But what they will try to do when they are here is definitely illegal. And few have any doubt that the smuggling of migrants is being aided through Bosnia by police and politicians at the highest level. According to Geoffrey Beaumont, coordinator of the UN's project to set up a functioning Bosnian State Border Service, more than 10 per cent of the half million illegal migrants who reached the EU last year came via the Bosnian route. And although Croatia has been catching up to 5,000 of them a year, few are in any doubt that, deported back to Bosnia, most will try again. By their third attempt officials believe most will have crossed into Europe proper. It is a route fast becoming one of the biggest headaches for the EU. Last week European Commissioner Chris Patten announced extra aid for training Bosnian and other Balkan police forces in the fight against migrant-smuggling after it was raised by EU Foreign Ministers. The announcement comes against a background of a rising sense of crisis in the EU over illegal migration which has increased more than tenfold in the past 10 years. Across Europe arrests at borders are rocketing, as are asylum applications across the 15 nations. In Bosnia the traffic in illegal migrants conceals a second, more venal trade in humans: the trade in sex slaves which lures women and young girls to Bosnia 'mainly from Eastern Europe and former Soviet republics' with the promise of jobs as au pairs or waitresses in the EU. In one of the most shocking cases, uncovered last summer, 12 women and young girls were found locked in a darkened room in a bar in the town of Prijedor, where they had been held and repeatedly raped. According to officials who dealt with the case, the horror of the original discovery was quickly overtaken by a sense of impotence as corrupt local officials frustrated their efforts to prosecute those involved. 'We had to move the women four times in 10 days to different secret safe houses because the traffickers kept turning up outside,' says Fredric Larrson, programme manager with the International Organisation for Migration in Sarajevo. Their persistence paid off. Faced with constant harassment, four of the five women prepared to testify against the slavers withdrew their evidence and the case collapsed. International officials have no question about how the women were so easily found. 'We have very strong indications,' said one official familiar with the case, 'that the authorities collude in both the trafficking of people and smuggling in illegal immigrants at the very highest level.' The case of the Prijedor women, say officials, is simply the starkest evidence of the difficulties they face in trying to stamp out human trafficking in Bosnia: the large-scale involvement of corrupt politicians and police. Prosecutions have been almost non-existent for both crimes; detection is hampered by those willing to help the people-smugglers. Among those named to The Observer by international officials as suspected of benefiting from the trade in migrants is the son of one of Bosnia's most respected figures. One senior official said: 'His company was organising special charter flights full of Iranians last year who simply disappeared. Do I think he is involved? I believe at least that he has benefited from it. The truth,' he continued, 'is that this is being encouraged by corruption at the very highest levels.' Evidence exists too that the smuggling business is part of a sophisticated international network that supplies forged documents as well. In some cases the trail leads to Britain. Late last year, say international police, a package was intercepted from London addressed to an Iranian woman renting accommodation in Sarajevo. Instead of the CDs it claimed to contain, the package was stuffed with stolen European passports. The shocking reality of Bosnia today, international officials say, is this. Five years after the Dayton Peace Agreement was signed to bring a genocidal war to an end, a country that has received unprecedented military and economic aid from the international community has turned, not into a model Balkan democracy, but into one of Europe's main hubs for smuggling people. 'It is depressing as hell,' said one official. 'Almost half the people in Sarajevo depend on the international community for their income, but we can't persuade the authorities to stamp it out. It would be easy if the international community was really bothered. We could simply say stop this or we stop the aid.' It is a threat already levelled against Yugoslavia, blamed for years under the Milosevic regime of being the main conduit of Chinese migrants into Europe. Late last year the EU told President Vojislav Kostunica that aid to his country is contingent on him closing the door to the tens of thousands of Chinese illegal immigrants using Belgrade as a first stop on their route into the EU. It is a solution many international officials believe should be applied to shock Bosnia's corrupt politicians out of their complacency. But they do not blame Bosnia alone. 'We are very concerned over what Europe is going to do about this problem,' says Geoffrey Beaumont. 'They say they are worried about this, but is their solution to seal off Bosnia from Europe?' So far, he concedes, there is little danger of that. The State Border Service he is helping to set up is 'so far working at only four of Bosnia's 400-odd border crossings. International funding for the project has been woeful. At present we have a budget of around \u00a36 million to control all of Bosnia's borders. If Europe was serious about controlling this problem all it would cost the individual governments would be around \u00a33m a year. That must be cheaper than the money that they are spending on detecting, arresting, holding and returning illegal refugees. So far the only people who are really trying hard on this issue are the Germans and the Dutch.' The alternative is a solution that is quickly becoming the EU's most controversial issue: a proposed scheme of managed migration into Europe via quotas and a 'green card' entry scheme similar to that in the US. Floated last December in a European Commission communication, it calls for a Europe-wide asylum and immigration policy that would abandon three decades of a zero migration policy in response to predictions of a declining and ageing European population that will need mass migration to sustain its economic life. What that would mean, according to the EU justice and home affairs Commissioner, Antonio Vitorino, involved in drawing up the paper, is a policy aimed at trebling legal migration to almost one million by 2004. But despite evidence collected by the Commission, the idea of a permit system for unskilled labourers like Wahab is unlikely to be smiled on by politicians in Britain or elsewhere. For although Britain's Home Office Minister, Barbara Roche, has been persuaded of the need to attract skilled migrants, no one has been persuaded of the case of those at the bottom of the ladder. It is a contradiction that has been noted by Sarah Spencer, director of the Citizenship and Governance programme of the Institute for Public Policy Research, who has been advising the Home Office on any change to its migration policy. 'One of the questions that has yet to be addressed is that, if we had legal channels into Britain and Europe, would it reduce the pressure to come in and dissuade people from going to the smugglers? That is a very sensitive issue. At the moment we have got a consensus that we need skilled labourers. We need to extend that consensus to a similar need for unskilled labourers of the kind currently coming in illegally.' Last week in Bosnia there was little room for optimism. The biggest success in the fight against the migrant trade in the past year was the international community persuading Iran to impose visas on its visitors to Bosnia, barring 25,000 Iranian migrants who passed through last year. They know there is little room for complacency. How little room exactly was revealed last week when The Observer visited a travel agency in the back streets of Aksaray, in Istanbul's old city.

'That can also be arranged, but it will cost much more.'",

She rarely gives interviews <br> </p> <p> <strong> Observer</strong>: First, what is The Bay of Angels about? <br> </p> <p> <strong> Brookner:</strong> It is about the sort of misfortune that can come upon you without warning, which finds you totally bereft trying to get yourself out of it. <br> </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> Was there a particular moment of inspiration ? <br> </p> <p> <strong> AB:</strong> Well, the curious thing is that I didn't intend to write it. I didn't know I was going to write it, so it came upon me quite suddenly and quite easily and I enjoyed writing it. I'm sorry if it's very bleak. I'm sorry if it's mournful. I had a good time, that's all I can say about it. <br> </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> It's your twentieth novel in about 20 years. Is that how you like to work - at the rate of a novel a year? <br> </p> <p> <strong> AB:</strong> I'd like to be writing all the time, but that's not possible. <br> </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> Why not? <br> </p> <p> <strong> AB:</strong> Lack of ideas, I suppose. <br> </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> Where do you think your ideas come from? <br> </p> <p> <strong> AB:</strong> I wish I knew. I'd tap into them straight away. I think it's mostly dreams and memories, isn't it, as with all novelists? And a certain amount of observation, obviously. <br> </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> Did you always want to be a novelist? <br> </p> <p> <strong> AB:</strong> No. <br> </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> What made you switch from teaching ? <br> </p> <p> <strong> AB:</strong> Well, I was a teacher most of my life, which I loved. I had a very happy working life and when I retired I thought I must do something and I've always read a lot of fiction, you learn so much from fiction. My sentimental education came mostly from fiction I should say, so I thought I'd try. <br> </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> You've been very successful for a late starter. <br> </p> <p> <strong> AB:</strong> I wouldn't say that. I'm not very popular, because they're bleak and they're mournful and all the rest of it and I get censorious reviews. But I'm only writing fiction. I'm not making munitions, so I think it's acceptable. <br> </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> In this book there are several references to art. How much does your art history influence your fiction, if at all? <br> </p> <p> <strong> AB:</strong> Not at all. <br> </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> So you keep your art history and your fiction in separate compartments? <br> </p> <p> <strong> AB:</strong> Absolutely. Well, they keep themselves in separate compartments. I'm a member of the public these days. I go to the galleries and wander around like everybody else. I love it. <br> </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> What did you read as a child? <br> </p> <p> <strong> AB:</strong> Ah! Dickens. My father fed me Dickens. Two novels for my birthday, two novels for Christmas until I'd read the lot. And after that I think it was H.G. Wells, for some reason. I've been talked about in the same context as Jane Austen. I didn't stick that label on myself, other people did. Quite inaccurate. I've never got on very well with Jane Austen. <br> </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> Where do you see yourself in the tradition of English literature? <br> </p> <p> <strong> AB:</strong> I don't know anything like that. I'm a middle-class, middle-brow novelist. And that's it. It amuses me. <br> </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> With a middle-class audience? <br> </p> <p> <strong> AB:</strong> Yes. Mostly women, but the best letters I've had have been from men. One man said a marvellous thing. He said: 'You write French novels', which pleased me enormously. <br> </p> <p><strong> Obs:</strong> Which foreign country are you most popular in? <br> </p> <p> <strong> AB:</strong> America. And France. I do better in America than I do here. <br> </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> Who was your father? <br> </p> <p> <strong> AB:</strong> My father was a small businessman, extremely virtuous, not very successful. He had a number of enterprises. He had a lending library at one point, I remember, which was, of course, very congenial. My mother had been a professional singer in America. And they were a virtuous couple and very unhappy and that sent mixed messages, as you can imagine. <br> </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> Were you close to your father? <br> </p> <p> <strong> AB:</strong> I was closer to my mother, but I loved them both. [Let me get you a cup of tea]. <br> </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> Who are the writers you admire now? <br> </p> <p> <strong> AB:</strong> I read a lot in French and I read the Russians. Here's my favourite novel. <br> </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> Oblomov. <br> </p> <p> <strong> AB:</strong> Yes. It's about a man who fails at everything. <br> </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> I confess I've never read it. <br> </p> <p><strong> AB: </strong> It's great. He fails at everything - not through any fault of his own, but through sheer inactivity. I learnt a terrific lesson there. <br> </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> Do you think failure is a subject to which you're drawn in your fiction? <br> </p> <p> <strong> AB:</strong> Much more interesting than success. <br> </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> There's a very powerful passage here. You write: 'As a woman approaching middle age I know that certain changes are inevitable, but I may not always be as adaptable as I have so far proved to be. I feel very tired, cranky, inclined to insist on a life of my own. I miss children, as all middle-aged women do, if they're childless.' Are your books, in some sense, your children? <br> </p> <p> <strong> AB:</strong> No. Not at all. <br> </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> And do you identify with that passage? <br> </p> <p> <strong> AB:</strong> I think so. <br> </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> The Bay of Angels is a book that the people who admire your work will recognise immediately. <br> <strong> AB:</strong> And denigrate. <br> </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> Do you ever think of writing a different kind of book entirely? <br> </p> <p> <strong> AB:</strong> I wish I could, I wish I could, maybe it'll come. I don't know. I've no control over these things. <br> </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> What would you do if you couldn't write fiction? <br> </p> <p> <strong> AB:</strong> Read fiction. <br> </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> So your life is really immersed in various kinds of fictional activity? <br> </p> <p> <strong> AB:</strong> Well, I live in the world, like everybody has to, and I go out, do the shopping, and do the cleaning - that sort of thing. See friends. I suppose what one wants really is ideal company and books are ideal company. <br> </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> And are you working on a new novel now? <br> </p> <p> <strong> AB:</strong> No. <br> </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> Where will the next idea come from? <br> </p> <p> <strong> AB:</strong> I don't know, that's the point. I have no control. I'm a great believer in unconscious processes. They usually work. <br> </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> When do you write? <br> </p> <p> <strong> AB: </strong> I start work at seven. <br> </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> Pencil or pen? <br> </p> <p> <strong> AB:</strong> Pen. <br> </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> In manuscript? <br> </p> <p> <strong> AB:</strong> I haven't got any of these machines. <br> </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> And do you type them up later on? <br> </p> <p> <strong> AB:</strong> Yes, I do that. <br> </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> And how long do you write for? <br> </p> <p> <strong> AB:</strong> Two or three hours. I think about it most of the day. <br> </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> All your books have this very intense atmosphere. <br> </p> <p> <strong> AB:</strong> That comes from the early reading, I think.

      "body": "<p><strong>The Other Side of Eden: Hunter-Gatherers, Farmers and the Shaping of the World</strong></p> <p> Hugh Brody</p> <p>Faber and Faber, \u00a320, pp348</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,XXX,00.html\">Buy it at a discount at BOL</a><br></p> <p> Anthropologist Hugh Brody describes the visit to London of Anaviapik, an Inuit who had never previously left the Arctic. Anaviapik is disgorged from a British Airways plane on a hot summer's day swathed in a fox-fur- trimmed parka and 'wearing sealskin boots with brown trousers tucked into their patterned tops'. To Brody's relief, Anaviapik survives this visit with equanimity. One thing he never masters, however, is the built environment. Everyday Brody teases him, challenging him to find the short way home from the Tube. Everyday he fails: 'How amazing that the Qallunaat [white people] live in cliffs. I would never be able to find my way here without you.' </p> <p>Back in the vast, white, apparently indecipherable landscapes of the Arctic Anaviapik has no such problem. On one occasion, Brody travels hundreds of miles with him by dog sledge. En route, Anaviapik diverts to a place he has not visited since 1938. 'How did you remember the way?' asks Brody. 'Inuit cannot get lost in our own land. If we have done a journey once we can always do it again.' This is one of the many instances which brings home to Brody the profound difference between hunter-gatherers' attitude to the land and our own. Theirs is an intimate knowledge of the land's contours, its seasons and creatures. A transformed landscape, dominated by man's activities, is alien and unattractive to them. </p> <p>Others have noted the differences in attitudes towards the land of hunter-gatherer societies. But all too often racism and prejudice dismiss hunter- gatherers as backward people too ignorant to settle the land. Over the years, Brody has lived with and studied several hunter-gatherer societies. He has become convinced that the hunter-gatherer world-view contains important lessons for humanity's future. </p> <p>He devotes much space to discussing Inuit language in addressing these issues. It is the language, he claims, that 'reveals different ways of knowing the world'. Anaviapik introduces him to Inuit not as a collection of words but as a culture. When Brody learns about seal hunting, he is shown not only how to hunt but how to talk about the hunt to other community members. He also learns there is no generic word for seal, only 'ringed seal, one-year-old ringed seal, adult male ringed seal, harp seal, bearded seal'. </p> <p>It is a well-known academic curiosity that Inuit has no generic word for snow either, only a vast array of different snowy conditions. For Brody, these are far from idle academic points. They expose how hunter-gatherer languages 'express and celebrate the importance of detailed knowledge of their natural world'. They demonstrate a complex and profound respect for their land and the creatures they hunt. Far from the miserable subsistence existence imagined by colonists, Brody meets an almost spiritual connection to the land. Many hunter-gatherers feel there's a porous connection between the natural and spirit world. </p> <p>Its impossible not to sympathise with Brody's indignation at the way the hunter-gatherers' language and culture have been misunderstood, silenced, and even repressed by those who have appropriated their lands. In one case, George, a member of the Nisga'a society in Alaska, recounts how he was forced by the government to leave his valley and attend an 'Indian residential school'. He was taken forcibly from his parents and his familiar coastal forests. He was beaten every time he used his own language. The terror George experienced is still palpable, as is the pain of separation from his culture. Equally distressing are the accounts of Nato's refusal to hear evidence from traditional 'experts' when an air base destroyed their hunting grounds. </p> <p>Those appropriating hunter-gatherer land pour contempt on their culture, dehumanising them by reference to their lack of discipline towards children, their subsistence existence. Brody sees these as a function of an egalitarian culture which is not interested in subduing children or landscape but in leaving nature intact. Now he is convinced the fundamental division in human history is between this world view and that of the hunter-gatherers' oppressors, the agriculturalists. </p> <p>Normally, hunter-gatherers are seen as nomads and farmers as settlers. Brody thinks the reverse is true. Farming culture is accompanied by 'a longing to be settled, a defensive holding of ground and a continuing endemic nomadism' caused by the continuous growth of population among such communities.

      "bodyText": "The Other Side of Eden: Hunter-Gatherers, Farmers and the Shaping of the World Hugh Brody Faber and Faber, \u00a320, pp348 Buy it at a discount at BOL Anthropologist Hugh Brody describes the visit to London of Anaviapik, an Inuit who had never previously left the Arctic. Anaviapik is disgorged from a British Airways plane on a hot summer's day swathed in a fox-fur- trimmed parka and 'wearing sealskin boots with brown trousers tucked into their patterned tops'. To Brody's relief, Anaviapik survives this visit with equanimity. One thing he never masters, however, is the built environment. Everyday Brody teases him, challenging him to find the short way home from the Tube. Everyday he fails: 'How amazing that the Qallunaat [white people] live in cliffs. I would never be able to find my way here without you.' Back in the vast, white, apparently indecipherable landscapes of the Arctic Anaviapik has no such problem. On one occasion, Brody travels hundreds of miles with him by dog sledge. En route, Anaviapik diverts to a place he has not visited since 1938. 'How did you remember the way?' asks Brody. 'Inuit cannot get lost in our own land. If we have done a journey once we can always do it again.' This is one of the many instances which brings home to Brody the profound difference between hunter-gatherers' attitude to the land and our own. Theirs is an intimate knowledge of the land's contours, its seasons and creatures. A transformed landscape, dominated by man's activities, is alien and unattractive to them. Others have noted the differences in attitudes towards the land of hunter-gatherer societies. But all too often racism and prejudice dismiss hunter- gatherers as backward people too ignorant to settle the land. Over the years, Brody has lived with and studied several hunter-gatherer societies. He has become convinced that the hunter-gatherer world-view contains important lessons for humanity's future. He devotes much space to discussing Inuit language in addressing these issues. It is the language, he claims, that 'reveals different ways of knowing the world'. Anaviapik introduces him to Inuit not as a collection of words but as a culture. When Brody learns about seal hunting, he is shown not only how to hunt but how to talk about the hunt to other community members. He also learns there is no generic word for seal, only 'ringed seal, one-year-old ringed seal, adult male ringed seal, harp seal, bearded seal'. It is a well-known academic curiosity that Inuit has no generic word for snow either, only a vast array of different snowy conditions. For Brody, these are far from idle academic points. They expose how hunter-gatherer languages 'express and celebrate the importance of detailed knowledge of their natural world'. They demonstrate a complex and profound respect for their land and the creatures they hunt. Far from the miserable subsistence existence imagined by colonists, Brody meets an almost spiritual connection to the land. Many hunter-gatherers feel there's a porous connection between the natural and spirit world. Its impossible not to sympathise with Brody's indignation at the way the hunter-gatherers' language and culture have been misunderstood, silenced, and even repressed by those who have appropriated their lands. In one case, George, a member of the Nisga'a society in Alaska, recounts how he was forced by the government to leave his valley and attend an 'Indian residential school'. He was taken forcibly from his parents and his familiar coastal forests. He was beaten every time he used his own language. The terror George experienced is still palpable, as is the pain of separation from his culture. Equally distressing are the accounts of Nato's refusal to hear evidence from traditional 'experts' when an air base destroyed their hunting grounds. Those appropriating hunter-gatherer land pour contempt on their culture, dehumanising them by reference to their lack of discipline towards children, their subsistence existence. Brody sees these as a function of an egalitarian culture which is not interested in subduing children or landscape but in leaving nature intact. Now he is convinced the fundamental division in human history is between this world view and that of the hunter-gatherers' oppressors, the agriculturalists. Normally, hunter-gatherers are seen as nomads and farmers as settlers. Brody thinks the reverse is true. Farming culture is accompanied by 'a longing to be settled, a defensive holding of ground and a continuing endemic nomadism' caused by the continuous growth of population among such communities. Genesis, says Brody is the ultimate agriculturalist myth, embodying their continuing quest to reshape nature as a lost Eden. Hunter-gatherers, by contrast, do not seek to reshape and dominate their landscape. Their conviction is that their land is 'already Eden and exile must be avoided'. Brody is also convinced that hunter-gatherers had different cultural origins from the agriculturalists since they do not share the Indo-European languages characteristic of all agricultural people. Brody postulates agriculturalists spread out from one place, a combative and imperialist culture which eventually drove hunter-gatherers to the edge of habitable land. Brody concludes that the fate of the hunter-gatherers is a hugely important part of human history. This is not a primitive culture surpassed by superior forms. Instead, it embodies an equally significant aspect of the human condition. As well as being an argument for the political rights of hunter-gatherer societies, The Other Side of Eden is also a passionate argument in support of recognising and nurturing the hunter-gatherer world-view. At a time when nature is so under threat from humanity, there are invaluable environmental lessons to be learnt from cultures which seek to survive from the land but also leave it as they find it.",

Not a month passes, it seems, but a new study emerges announcing its intention to anatomise, deconstruct, unmask or interpret the F\u00fchrer.

Well, in perpetuating mystery and incompleteness, I suspect, judging from the experience of the American journalist Ron Rosenbaum. In his recent book, Explaining Hitler, Rosenbaum interviewed the world's leading authorities on Nazism, including Steiner and the reviled David Irving, only to conclude after more than 400 pages that, in fact, there is little to conclude: that Hitler remains resolutely inexplicable, a figure whose motives are hidden in impenetrable darkness. </p> <p>The German historian Joachim Fest understood something of this dangerous emptiness when he spoke of Hitler as being an 'unperson', a nihilist bereft of any coherent sense of self.

Albert Speer, as revealed by Gitta Sereny in her biography of the duplicitous architect, clearly loved the F\u00fchrer and continued to love him long after his death.

And Hitler studies are the subject of this impressive, but perhaps premature, new book by John Lukacs. </p> <p>It is premature for two reasons. First, as Lukacs acknowledges, our academic interest in Hitler now lies less in what more there is to discover than in understanding. If so, it is too early to offer definitive judgement on Hitler's biographers, for more will inevitably follow. Second, in his eagerness to complete this book before the end of the last century (it was published in the US in 1998), thus offering a timely retrospective on Hitler's posthumous reputation at a moment when we were all haunted by a sense of an ending, he ignored, except for a glancing reference in one of many footnotes, one of the best books on Hitler - Brigitte Hamann's Hitler's Vienna (1998). </p> <p>Hamann's triumph was to return to the darkest, the most formative and least known part of Hitler's life: that of his adolescence in Linz, the Upper Austrian provincial capital, and of his early adulthood as a restless wanderer in Habsburg Vienna, the imperial metropolis, the cosmopolitan seat of an ancient empire. Artistic-intellectual fin-de-si\u00e8cle Vienna was a world of radical innovation - of Freud, Mahler, Wittgenstein, Klimt, Schnitzler, Schoenberg and Adolf Loos. But this was not Hitler's Vienna. Rather, his was a city of the disenfranchised little people, insurgent on all fronts, bewildered and frightened by Viennese modernity. </p> <p>Hamann followed the young vagabond Hitler on his journey into the lower depths of the city - a world of men's hostels, of isolation, threat and, as Hitler wrote in Mein Kampf , of 'constant unappeasable hunger' - and in so doing, through super-sleuthing and fidelity to primary sources, she challenged and overturned many of the popular misconceptions about Hitler: that he had Jewish antecedents; that he was an anti-Semite as soon as he arrived in Vienna; that he abandoned his dying mother; that Jewish academics played a part in his rejection from the Academy for Visual Arts in Vienna. (Kershaw leans heavily on Hamann in his discussion of Hitler's early years.) </p> <p>Hamann was a diligent re-reader, too, of August 'Gustl' Kubizek's book My Friend Hitler, which many biographers had dismissed as unreliable, the work of a fantasist, and which Lukacs here never mentions. But Kubizek was, in one sense, Hitler's first biographer. After all, they were close friends during his formative years in Linz (they met at the opera), when their heads were clumsily full of yearning and dreams of limitless artistic achievement. He later accompanied Hitler to, and lived with him in, Vienna. They separated in 1908 when, as Kubizek wrote, Hitler disappeared into the 'shadowy depths of the metropolis', from which he emerged, unutterably changed, in 1913. </p> <p>Where Lukacs excels, however, is in his shrewd analysis of how history and biography have grown closer together, and of how many of the new historians have become adept at exploiting the slippage between exegesis and fact. 'History is not the truth,' he writes, 'but the pursuit of truth through hindsight. The pursuit is inseparable from the purposes of the pursuers.' This is a smart observation; Lukacs understands that in an age when boundaries between fact, fiction and interpretation are collapsing - when more and more novelists, for instance, are appropriating real-life characters and the past for fictional ends - meaning itself has become intrinsically unstable. </p> <p>The Hitler battles of the future, then, will flourish not in the search for truth but in its interpretation, less in accuracy than in understanding. And it is in the academy, no less than in popular imagination, that Hitler will continue to enjoy a curious afterlife - if not as an iconic presence then as one whose crimes and inexplicability will lend themselves to multiple and conflicting interpretations, certainly enough to keep the professors busy for years. As Nietzsche said, presciently as ever: 'There is no truth, only interpretations.' </p>",

Nevertheless, some of the greatest allies of the queer liberation movement have been black leaders, such as Huey Newton, Desmond Tutu, Jesse Jackson and Thabo Mbeki. In 1987, I challenged the homophobia of the African National Congress. The result was a U-turn. The ANC went on to ensure that South Africa became the first country with a constitution outlawing discrimination based on sexual orientation. Aside from its critique of black culture, The Great Taboo celebrates the long-marginalised experience of those who are both black and gay, and the conflicts this creates between their dual identities. 'Are you black first or are you queer?' asks Gregory Conerly. It was a dilemma that haunted James Baldwin, Ma Rainey, Langston Hughes and Bessie Smith. Neglected by the black, white and gay communities, these voices from the crossroads of the sexual and racial diaspora speak to people of all races and sexualities.",

Not I, but himself, has made it clear that his work is of frustration, resentment and aggression.' </p> <p>For Still, who described his own non-representational painting as 'pictorial meditations on life, death, and the persistence of spirit', the absence of any tradition of metaphor, symbol or mythology in Rothko's art means that the gallery-goer is helpless to pursue his or her own voyage of creative discovery, prevented from engaging with a Rothko painting in any other terms than those already laid down by the artist himself. Rothko's 'iconoclasm', in other words, his shattering of the recognisable conventions of imaging, becomes, in execution, unacceptably coercive. </p> <p>In Idolising Pictures: Idolatry, Iconoclasm and Jewish Art, Anthony Julius proposes an identifiably 'Jewish' tradition in art which rejects (as Still maintains Rothko does) the continuous and largely unbroken tradition of Christian figurative representation and classical mythological imagery which has defined Western art since the Renaissance. The observant Jew is bound by the biblical injunction: 'Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.' A distinctively Jewish art, Julius argues, engages with the unease generated by Judaism's fundamental iconoclasm, and the consciously idolatrous nature of the high tradition in Christian art. As a serious alternative to the mainstream, such an art emerges with modernism at the beginning of the twentieth century. </p> <p>The moment of modernism is, conventionally, the moment at which art scrutinises the traditional ways of conveying meaning, dismantles them and announces that from now on meanings have to be rebuilt, without the benefit of history. When the agreed-on order, stories and images are emptied out, to become simply fragments in a palette of possibilities the artist manipulates at will, then, finally, according to Julius, the Jewish artist can get on with a distinctive artistic agenda. </p> <p>There are two obvious problems with this argument. One is, as Julius himself readily admits, that the attraction of art for Jewish artists such as Marc Chagall and Mark Rothko is that it is transgressive of all representational 'rules': 'Not only did art defy family expectations for a bourgeois career, it was also contrary to Jewish tradition. Rothko himself wrote, \"Without monsters and gods, art cannot enact our drama: art's most profound moments express this frustration.\"' </p> <p>There seems no intrinsic reason, then, why an artist designated 'Jewish' should not draw upon the repertoire of canonical Christian artistic symbols (the crucifixion, the Madonna and child) to produce a conscious tension between the 'given' (Christian iconography) and his or her own creative impulse. But Julius's argument for symbolic separateness forces him to the conclusion that because of its imaginative adaptation of Christian iconography, the work of a painter as distinguished and distinctive as Chagall nevertheless fails his test of Jewishness: 'What Chagall's career demonstrates is that the Jewish artist can also contribute to the dominant, non-Jewish artistic repertoire. But for Jewish art, this in itself is not enough.' </p> <p>The second problem with Julius's argument, though, is one which makes me more uneasy. Idolising Pictures insists on the absolute distinctness of Jewish cultural experience, because of the injunction in Exodus, and on the importance of an equivalently distinctive art for the framing of Jewish identity. This is classic 'allosemitism' - the setting the Jews apart in society, as people radically different from all others, needing separate concepts to describe and comprehend them. According to this view, Jews are unassimilable 'others', permanently available as a reference point for social and cultural unease. As Zymunt Bauman describes it: 'The Jew is ambivalence incarnate. And ambivalence is ambivalence mostly because it cannot be contemplated without ambivalent feeling, it is simultaneously attractive and repelling.' </p> <p>Such an affirmation of disturbing difference, attributable to a single group on grounds of some fundamental ethnic altereity, does not seem to me a helpful one for an art critic to make at the beginning of the twenty-first century. It leads directly to Julius's privileging art which is hectoring and bullying in the message it seeks to convey. It tempts him into overlooking what in other contexts he himself would be only too ready to recognise - that art is tribal (as Antony Gormley puts it), not because it is sectarian, but because its resonances are inevitably culturally inclusive. The many diasporas which are included in contemporary Britain derive their senses of identity not by rejecting a long indigenous tradition in art and literature, but by productively placing it in tension with the variety of representational alternatives to which they have access. </p> <p>It is, surely, a vigorous struggle with the culturally local that gives the work of artists like R.B. Kitaj or Anselm Kiefer its lasting power and significance. Not their status as Jews (I had never thought about the 'Jewishness' of either before I read Julius's book), but their engagement with the perennial predicament of humanity. As one critic wrote recently of Kitaj: 'In a world where the centre will not hold, Kitaj turns for succour to those who, faced with the violence that is the world's constant refrain, themselves affirm life in their writing and painting, in their allegiances and convictions. To glimpse homages and icons in Kitaj's paintings, ghosts of others who went before, is to see what may be the only beauty vouchsafed us on our doomed journey through an alien countryside.' </p> <p>Is such an artistic practice specifically Jewish? Personally, I prefer to think that it is part of a shared project in which each and every one can, and ought to, participate. </p>",

Its workmanship is such a treat. It is decorous and as finely made as a Queen Anne - or should that be Queen Anita? - chest of drawers. Brookner is a regal writer whose novels have sometimes seemed to imply that happiness itself is vulgar. But in The Bay of Angels she seems determined to turn over a new leaf. She declares her unusual intention: she is to investigate happy endings. </p> <p>A widow, Anne, and her daughter, Zoe, live together in hopeful passivity, proficient at mutual solitude, as if confined to a Gwen John painting. But Zoe is confident, rightly, that this state of affairs will not last: 'But I did know, or was convinced, that our story would have a happy ending, not realising that there is no proper ending in human affections until time provides an ending to which we must all submit.' (Observe the formidable way the sentence doesn't draw breath until it catches up with its own death.) </p> <p>Anne remarries. Simon is kind, elderly and rich. He rescues the two women from their elegant penury but may not be a reliable purveyor of happiness. He does not seem in perfect health, his business affairs are mysterious, he is dismayingly voyeuristic when Zoe's sexy boyfriend Adam comes to stay. What will become of this m\u00e9nage? </p> <p>Zoe is expert at attempting to answer questions of this kind. She lives in a subjunctive mood. Much of the book pursues her mournful imaginings of what her future may hold; variations on themes of solitude and disappointment. And when her stepfather dies suddenly and her mother is admitted to a sanatorium, she imagines the future after her mother has been discharged: 'My life would be hedged in by duties, most of them of an unwanted nature.' </p> <p>But no one can foretell their own future and Zoe's predictions are a waste of time. I found this novel chilling but never dull (even though it often describes chronic stasis). It is a tribute to Brookner's power as a narrator that she manages to make Zoe's situation so engrossing. Yet Zoe's take on life is depressing. It is like being admitted into a sanatorium where everything is beautifully done for one, but there is no way out. </p> <p>House arrest, the sense of being immured, is a state Anita Brookner writes about better than anyone.

Its workmanship is such a treat. It is decorous and as finely made as a Queen Anne - or should that be Queen Anita? - chest of drawers. Brookner is a regal writer whose novels have sometimes seemed to imply that happiness itself is vulgar. But in The Bay of Angels she seems determined to turn over a new leaf. She declares her unusual intention: she is to investigate happy endings. A widow, Anne, and her daughter, Zoe, live together in hopeful passivity, proficient at mutual solitude, as if confined to a Gwen John painting. But Zoe is confident, rightly, that this state of affairs will not last: 'But I did know, or was convinced, that our story would have a happy ending, not realising that there is no proper ending in human affections until time provides an ending to which we must all submit.' (Observe the formidable way the sentence doesn't draw breath until it catches up with its own death.) Anne remarries. Simon is kind, elderly and rich. He rescues the two women from their elegant penury but may not be a reliable purveyor of happiness. He does not seem in perfect health, his business affairs are mysterious, he is dismayingly voyeuristic when Zoe's sexy boyfriend Adam comes to stay. What will become of this m\u00e9nage? Zoe is expert at attempting to answer questions of this kind. She lives in a subjunctive mood. Much of the book pursues her mournful imaginings of what her future may hold; variations on themes of solitude and disappointment. And when her stepfather dies suddenly and her mother is admitted to a sanatorium, she imagines the future after her mother has been discharged: 'My life would be hedged in by duties, most of them of an unwanted nature.' But no one can foretell their own future and Zoe's predictions are a waste of time. I found this novel chilling but never dull (even though it often describes chronic stasis). It is a tribute to Brookner's power as a narrator that she manages to make Zoe's situation so engrossing. Yet Zoe's take on life is depressing. It is like being admitted into a sanatorium where everything is beautifully done for one, but there is no way out. House arrest, the sense of being immured, is a state Anita Brookner writes about better than anyone. Here she tries to give herself the slip but happiness goes against the grain. Zoe finds love with a person who borders on ineligibility. For a start, he has an unmarried sister living with him. Perhaps she might serve as the heroine for Brookner's twenty-first novel. \u0095 Read an Interview with Anita Brookner here.",

'The problem is definitely no longer linked only to management occupations. It now includes ordinary office workers and manual workers too.' </p> <p>In the private sector, employees are suffering from the requirement to deliver higher and higher productivity per person. In the public sector, beleaguered staff are often being asked to bear greater degrees of responsibility with fewer resources. </p> <p>'Among groups such as teachers, social workers and police officers, 25 per cent are now suffering from serious stress symptoms,' said McLeod. 'In other occupations, we're finding between 10 and 15 per cent of workers with problems.' Undiagnosed anxiety conditions now cause more lost days from work than complaints such as backache, hangovers and stomach upset. </p> <p>Miriam West, from Swanage, Dorset, said: 'I worked for 15 years and was very successful but two years ago I began to feel almost frozen at work. I didn't know what it was. I hated the idea of going in to the office. I would just sit at weekends and in the evening doing almost nothing. </p> <p>'When I was at work I constantly chastised myself for not doing enough. In retrospect, I was over-performing. I was setting standards for myself which I couldn't reach. My bosses were staggered when I decided to leave. They hadn't realised that the chaotic atmosphere they created was putting pressure on everyone else. </p> <p>'But I only made the final decision to re-assess my career after seeing a counsellor. He encouraged me to work out exactly what was creating the pressure and how I could address it.' </p> <p>Almost 1,000 major British firms already provide free stress counselling services to employees. Staff are referred for three to six sessions in the first instance. </p> <p>'However much we try to minimise sources of stress in the workplace and however much we work to improve employee resilience to pressure, we have to acknowledge that there'll always be some people who need help,' says Dr Marian Roden, corporate medical director of SmithKline Beecham. 'The provision of counselling services ensures our staff always have somewhere to turn. Whether the primary source of stress lies within or outside the workplace, early resolution facilitates a rapid return to productivity.' </p> <p>Mike Doig of Chevron Europe, an arm of the US oil company and another provider of workplace support, said: 'The evidence not only demonstrates the positive emotional outcomes of help, but also makes a first-rate business case. For every $1 we spend, we have saved between $6 and $10.' </p> <p>The report suggests workplace counselling can reduce the incidence of office stress by 50 per cent. Efficiency savings include higher performance and lower levels of sickness and unexplained absence. Substance abuse - from alcohol to serious drugs - also falls among staff who have received help. </p> <p>Dr Michael Reddy, whose company ICAS provides workplace counselling to businesses in Britain, said: 'It's not just a question of shopfloor versus management, as trade unions have often suggested. In this cost- and corner-cutting culture we are all in the stress firing line. Managers who work 16-hour days are as misguided as lorry drivers who fall asleep at the wheel.' </p> <p>Miriam West insists that workplace counselling transformed her life. She has left the financial services industry and is setting up a landscape gardening business. 'I won't earn quite so much, but I'm immeasurably happier. One regret I do have is that I didn't take advice earlier. I think if I had seen someone five years ago, I might have found it much easier to change things at work.

'American employees tend to be more positive about being counselled for workplace problems. Consequently they tell their mates. In British organisations, that admission is much less likely.

      "body": "<p>The victims of Vauxhall's Luton closure have plenty of candidates for blame, from the high pound and the relative ease of British shutdowns to the hire-and-fire mentality of the American overlords. But the real cause runs deeper through decades of managerial mishaps. </p> <p>The British managers bear some responsibility for the underlying, persistent weakness of the Vauxhall brand. But that's as nothing compared with the monumental mistakes of parent General Motors, at home and abroad. Entangled in bureaucracy, paralysed by inaction, drowning in excess costs, GM has wasted tens of billions on learning how not to run a mega-corporation. </p> <p>Very few other car managements are in a position to hurl the first stone. Consider the present scene of devastation. Chrysler, quite recently the most profitable US carmaker by far, is bleeding millions so fast that its purchaser, Daimler-Benz, is buckling at the knees. Daimler not only overpaid ridiculously, but compounded this sin by heavy-handed and typically unsuccessful long-distance interference. </p> <p>BMW is still licking its wounds from the inept takeover of Rover Group. But there is no comfort for British management in these foreign fiascos. Not only Rover but also its sister Land Rover were found wanting in fundamental management and manufacturing skills by their new owners. So, in spades, was Jaguar. The first American sent to the rescue by Ford declared its plant the worst he had ever seen, with the possible exception of the Gorki factory outside Moscow. </p> <p>In fact, the list of ineptitudes is as long as the M1. Is there some pattern here? The carmakers have all that managers could desire: huge financial resources, vast expertise, armies of well- versed executives and specialists, global markets and public demand.

      "bodyText": "The victims of Vauxhall's Luton closure have plenty of candidates for blame, from the high pound and the relative ease of British shutdowns to the hire-and-fire mentality of the American overlords. But the real cause runs deeper through decades of managerial mishaps. The British managers bear some responsibility for the underlying, persistent weakness of the Vauxhall brand. But that's as nothing compared with the monumental mistakes of parent General Motors, at home and abroad. Entangled in bureaucracy, paralysed by inaction, drowning in excess costs, GM has wasted tens of billions on learning how not to run a mega-corporation. Very few other car managements are in a position to hurl the first stone. Consider the present scene of devastation. Chrysler, quite recently the most profitable US carmaker by far, is bleeding millions so fast that its purchaser, Daimler-Benz, is buckling at the knees. Daimler not only overpaid ridiculously, but compounded this sin by heavy-handed and typically unsuccessful long-distance interference. BMW is still licking its wounds from the inept takeover of Rover Group. But there is no comfort for British management in these foreign fiascos. Not only Rover but also its sister Land Rover were found wanting in fundamental management and manufacturing skills by their new owners. So, in spades, was Jaguar. The first American sent to the rescue by Ford declared its plant the worst he had ever seen, with the possible exception of the Gorki factory outside Moscow. In fact, the list of ineptitudes is as long as the M1. Is there some pattern here? The carmakers have all that managers could desire: huge financial resources, vast expertise, armies of well- versed executives and specialists, global markets and public demand. How could they get so much so wrong? The first answer is that this industry is highly inbred, dominated by company veterans who, like all their colleagues, adore playing with motors. Infusions of outside talent are rare, and so is jobhopping at the highest level. When jobs are hopped, as when a miffed Lee Iacocca quit Ford for Chrysler, the results can be electrifying.

Most of these websites assume you are an existing current account customer. How do I get at my money when I need it? Some accounts allow you to access your cash via an ATM; others offer the option of transfers to another account. It is important to find this out before you choose your account, because you may be charged for certain extra services.

      "body": "<p>If you're a graduate, can you remember exactly what you studied and why? Might you have made a different decision had you known that \u00a3250,000 or more could be riding on it? </p> <p>According to research by the University of Warwick published last year, a woman studying law could expect to earn on average \u00a310,000 more in every year of her working life than one who chose agriculture. (A male graduate could earn a further \u00a37,400 a year, but that's another story.) </p> <p>Now the latest edition of What Do Graduates Do?, the annual study published jointly by the Association of Graduate Careers Advisory Services, the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service and the Higher Education Careers Services Unit, suggests that graduates in design studies are three times more likely to be unemployed than those who studied law. Suddenly, a decision so often taken on a teenage whim assumes a major importance. </p> <p>In the past, some of the newer vocational degrees, such as media studies, have had a rough ride, but the evidence shows that they do lead to jobs. Indeed, media studies is the fifth most employable discipline, according to What Do Graduates Do? Only graduates in computing, accountancy, business and civil engineering - four more respectable but equally vocational subjects - are more likely to be in jobs. </p> <p>In the Warwick survey, too, the top earners were all graduates in vocational subjects: law, computing, business and medicine. Maths, in fifth place, was the top-earning academic discipline. But with this summer's graduates likely to enter the job market with debts of \u00a312,000-15,000, according to the National Union of Students, you don't have to be a maths graduate to see that it takes a brave teenager to plump for a non-vocational degree these days. </p> <p>So in 2001, is the writing on the wall for history and sociology? Lesley Knaggs, president of AGCAS, thinks not. 'There is a close correlation between some of the vocational subjects and good well-paid jobs,' she says. 'But if you look at the unemployment levels among these graduates, they're certainly not the lowest. If you don't make it in a vocational subject, or you change your mind, you could be in trouble because you then have to explain that apparent failure to a future employer.' </p> <p>A vocational degree can be a big mistake if that subject is not your vocation. 'If you move into the wrong job and leave within six months, how's that going to help pay off your debts?' Knaggs asks. </p> <p>Tony Higgins, chief executive of Ucas, agrees. 'The hard evidence is that virtually all graduates find jobs relevant to their academic qualification within a relatively short time. Higher education applicants must be encouraged to select courses which best suit their academic and personal strengths and interests, rather than being swayed by short-term inducements which may land them in careers they won't enjoy.' </p> <p>Graduates of all types are hot property in the job market. Graduate unemployment has fallen every year since 1992. It is now 5.5 per cent six months after graduating, and as low as 2 per cent three years later. This is despite the continuing growth in the numbers of students. About 30 per cent of 18- year-olds now enter higher education - twice the rate of 10 years ago - and the Government has a target of 50 per cent. </p> <p>This is a trend that could see employers looking for a little more from their graduate recruits than a blinkered vocationalism. 'With degrees becoming more commonplace and job-hunting more competitive, employers are looking for evidence of other \"soft\" skills,' says Knaggs. </p> <p>The Employment Satisfaction Survey asked 127 graduate employers what they were looking for in a graduate. Their top 10 were a willingness to learn, commitment, dependability, self-motivation, teamwork, oral communication skills, co-operation, written communication skills, energy and self-management. </p> <p>These are the sort of transferable skills that students with a broader approach to learning tend to develop - Higgins urges plenty of extracurricular activity, too - rather than those narrowly obsessed with the job market. </p> <p>However, despite graduates' growing debt burden, more and more of them go on to post-graduate study. 'The rate is up to one in five,' says Lesley Knaggs, 'and at some institutions it's far higher.' </p> <p>And it is here that academic graduates may be responding to a perceived need for greater vocationalism in their studies. Knaggs says: 'Some of these post-graduates are doing traditional training, such as teaching and law, but others are looking to add something business-related to their qualifications, or to develop their IT skills.' </p> <p>Rob Aspinall, 38, is a university lecturer in English, a subject he didn't study at university, in Japan, a country he didn't visit until he was in his late twenties. 'I would say that someone who is very good at an obscure subject has a better chance than someone with a middling qualification at a more \"suitable\" subject,' he says. 'In other words, it is more important to be good at what you do, rather than to choose a subject just because it sounds like it might have more chance of getting you a job.' </p> <p>Whatever your degree choice, there are signs that it is once again becoming a decision to be made sooner rather than later in life. After several years of growth, the number of mature students was down last year and Knaggs is concerned that it may continue. 'The debt burden may put mature students off more than younger ones,' she says. 'For them there are often other factors like a family or a mortgage that make the debt just too big a risk to take.' </p> <p>So what should you do? The advice from careers advisers is to follow your heart, not the money. Graduates in less conventional degree subjects agree. Belinda Canham, 34, now a PR consultant, says: 'Look back at anyone's career path and you'll see it is littered with changes of direction, changes of mind, missed opportunities and opportunities taken. I think you should just enjoy your studies and keep an open mind about where they will lead you.' </p> <p>It's just the sort of measured, historically aware overview you'd expect from someone who graduated in Greek civilisation and philosophy.</p>",
