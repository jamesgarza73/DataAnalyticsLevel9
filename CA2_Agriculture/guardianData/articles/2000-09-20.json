You're not alone. </p> <p>Plano XXI, a season of Portuguese contemporary art, is currently doing its best to educate us with events in galleries, cinemas and music venues across Glasgow. It is an engaging, spirited selection of emergent, experimental works rather than established names. </p> <p>Ines Paris (at Street Level Photoworks) presents her Revolutionary Kit - posters and the simplest of disruptive materials. Pieces of paper with TEMPORARILY OUT OF ORDER typed on them are piled high, just the right dimensions for a cash machine screen. It seems crazy, facile almost, as if it would never work. Then you remember the fuel crisis, the sudden simple crisis, and you know it could. Joao Tabarra (also at Street Level) prefers fantasy to revolution in his large colour photographs. The artist trawls over rocky terrain or bleak urban streets in the company of the oddest human fairy - all shimmery dress and big wand, but seemingly no magical powers. </p> <p>Francisco Querios (Intermedia Gallery) is a wizard by comparison, and one with a fine sense of humour. In two short animated films, he focuses on the body in video games - its stilted and yet ultra-real quality. In one, in a My Little Pony landscape with a calming, repetitive soundtrack, girls whack each other, push each other over. It's funny in the way The Magic Roundabout (18 certificate, directed by Tarantino) would be funny. </p> <p>At the G-Mac/Exhibition Space things take a darker turn, with some work that dwells rather too long on suicide and violent sexual fantasy. It treats the latter with some humour though - Joao Fonte Santa's furious black-and-white drawings are all orgiastic orifices and no trousers, one with a big JOIN NOW slogan across it. Paulo Mendes has Ken and Barbie up to all sorts in the work Kiss Me Stupid, locked away in a suburban bedroom complete with borders and a nice dressing table. We peek in; Ken, casually in flagrante, stares back in the mirror. In the centre of the exhibition space, a polystyrene head sits on a table, unexplained. There are pens for you to leave a message, many of which are in Portuguese; sex and football are the themes. We may not know the names, but that does not make Plano XXI the cultural stranger you might expect. </p> <p> \u0095 Until October 14. Details: 0141-553 2620.</p>",

Ines Paris (at Street Level Photoworks) presents her Revolutionary Kit - posters and the simplest of disruptive materials. Pieces of paper with TEMPORARILY OUT OF ORDER typed on them are piled high, just the right dimensions for a cash machine screen. It seems crazy, facile almost, as if it would never work. Then you remember the fuel crisis, the sudden simple crisis, and you know it could. Joao Tabarra (also at Street Level) prefers fantasy to revolution in his large colour photographs. The artist trawls over rocky terrain or bleak urban streets in the company of the oddest human fairy - all shimmery dress and big wand, but seemingly no magical powers. Francisco Querios (Intermedia Gallery) is a wizard by comparison, and one with a fine sense of humour. In two short animated films, he focuses on the body in video games - its stilted and yet ultra-real quality. In one, in a My Little Pony landscape with a calming, repetitive soundtrack, girls whack each other, push each other over. It's funny in the way The Magic Roundabout (18 certificate, directed by Tarantino) would be funny. At the G-Mac/Exhibition Space things take a darker turn, with some work that dwells rather too long on suicide and violent sexual fantasy. It treats the latter with some humour though - Joao Fonte Santa's furious black-and-white drawings are all orgiastic orifices and no trousers, one with a big JOIN NOW slogan across it. Paulo Mendes has Ken and Barbie up to all sorts in the work Kiss Me Stupid, locked away in a suburban bedroom complete with borders and a nice dressing table. We peek in; Ken, casually in flagrante, stares back in the mirror. In the centre of the exhibition space, a polystyrene head sits on a table, unexplained. There are pens for you to leave a message, many of which are in Portuguese; sex and football are the themes. We may not know the names, but that does not make Plano XXI the cultural stranger you might expect. \u0095 Until October 14. Details: 0141-553 2620.",

Not Gordon Brown. </p> <p>Forecasts from top City experts that Mr Brown may have a surplus of at least \u00a315 billion in his war chest next spring - \u00a310 billion more than he was predicting in March - come at the worst possible time for the chancellor in the wake of last week's fuel crisis. </p> <p>Government attempts to plead poverty in response to the protests, claiming that the price of lower petrol duties would be cuts in public spending on schools and hospitals, are difficult to sustain when tax revenues are pouring into the exchequer. </p> <p>With the Conservatives baying for tax cuts, the government now faces a dilemma. On the one hand, Mr Brown has the money in the bank to ease the tax burden next spring, thereby appeasing disgruntled swing voters seen as crucial to a second Blair victory. But, on the other hand, an over-generous package of tax cuts would run the risk of stimulating a Lawson-style inflationary boom, and would be certain to trigger higher interest rates from the Bank of England. The next six months will be spent trying to steer a path between the politics and the economics of tax cuts. </p> <p>There is no doubt that 8 years of continual growth have left the public finances in rude good health. Yesterday's figures show that the Chancellor's ballooning surplus is due to a combination of higher-than-expected income from taxes and lower-than-expected public spending. </p> <p>The strong economy and rapidly falling unemployment mean that tax receipts are growing much faster than forecast at the time of the Budget, when it was assumed that the number of people out of work and claiming benefit would average 1.16m this year. Last month's total of unemployed was 1.07m. Within months, the dole queues are likely to shrink below the 1m level for the first time since the late 1970s. </p> <p>In March, Mr Brown predicted that central government receipts, which make up the vast bulk of government income, would grow from \u00a3335.1bn last year to \u00a3352.8bn this year, an increase of 5.3%. So far this year they have expanded by 9.1%, with income tax accounting for most of the increase, up 9.3% in the first 5 months of the financial year, against the Chancellor's full-year Budget forecast of 6.1%. More people are in work and paying tax, and self-assessment is a nice little earner for the inland revenue, with the honesty of tax payers increasing the yield. </p> <p>Despite its claims, the government is reaping a windfall from higher oil prices, although the source of the extra cash is not the consumers but North sea producers. The Budget assumed that oil prices would average $22.40(\u00a315.80) a barrel whereas it is currently well over $30(\u00a321), giving the Treasury an extra \u00a32-3bn as a result of higher production and bigger profits for the oil companies. </p> <p>While cash is flooding in to the Treasury's coffers, ministers seem curiously reluctant to part with the cash they have been allocated, particularly on public in vestment, where spending last year was lower than under John Major. </p> <p>Last year saw the public sector spending as a percentage of GDP fall to its lowest level for 37 years. The figures for this year show little sign of a quick turnaround. The Chancellor had predicted that current spending would rise by about 8% this year but so far it is up by 5-6%. </p> <p>Jonathan Loynes, chief British econo mist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said the shortfall in spending was due to many factors, including bureaucratic delays, staff shortages in the public sector, the shrinking dole queue, which reduces social security payments, and falling interest payments on government debt. David Walton of Goldman Sachs warned that overall government spending could increase with big public investment projects due to come on stream later in the year. But he added: \"The numbers are looking a lot better than appeared at Budget time.\" </p> <p>Even allowing for a rebound in spending and a deterioration in the growth of tax receipts over the rest of the year, City economists say Mr Brown will be sitting on at least an extra \u00a310bn compared to his Budget forecast. His surplus is likely to be near \u00a315bn and may even be larger. </p> <p>A simple extrapolation from the surplus for the first five months of this year, suggests a surplus of \u00a324bn is possible. </p> <p>Richard Iley of the Dutch bank ABN-AMRO said: \"Faced with this embarrassment of riches and growing political problems, a tax cutting budget next March increasingly looks inevitable. But with the biggest fiscal stimulus for 25 years already in the pipeline, any further fiscal loosening will only further increase upward pressure on interest rates.\" That is Brown's dilemma. Although taxpayers are watching Mr Brown's every move, so too is the Bank of England.</p>",

The strong economy and rapidly falling unemployment mean that tax receipts are growing much faster than forecast at the time of the Budget, when it was assumed that the number of people out of work and claiming benefit would average 1.16m this year. Last month's total of unemployed was 1.07m. Within months, the dole queues are likely to shrink below the 1m level for the first time since the late 1970s. In March, Mr Brown predicted that central government receipts, which make up the vast bulk of government income, would grow from \u00a3335.1bn last year to \u00a3352.8bn this year, an increase of 5.3%. So far this year they have expanded by 9.1%, with income tax accounting for most of the increase, up 9.3% in the first 5 months of the financial year, against the Chancellor's full-year Budget forecast of 6.1%. More people are in work and paying tax, and self-assessment is a nice little earner for the inland revenue, with the honesty of tax payers increasing the yield. Despite its claims, the government is reaping a windfall from higher oil prices, although the source of the extra cash is not the consumers but North sea producers. The Budget assumed that oil prices would average $22.40(\u00a315.80) a barrel whereas it is currently well over $30(\u00a321), giving the Treasury an extra \u00a32-3bn as a result of higher production and bigger profits for the oil companies. While cash is flooding in to the Treasury's coffers, ministers seem curiously reluctant to part with the cash they have been allocated, particularly on public in vestment, where spending last year was lower than under John Major. Last year saw the public sector spending as a percentage of GDP fall to its lowest level for 37 years. The figures for this year show little sign of a quick turnaround. The Chancellor had predicted that current spending would rise by about 8% this year but so far it is up by 5-6%. Jonathan Loynes, chief British econo mist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said the shortfall in spending was due to many factors, including bureaucratic delays, staff shortages in the public sector, the shrinking dole queue, which reduces social security payments, and falling interest payments on government debt. David Walton of Goldman Sachs warned that overall government spending could increase with big public investment projects due to come on stream later in the year. But he added: \"The numbers are looking a lot better than appeared at Budget time.\" Even allowing for a rebound in spending and a deterioration in the growth of tax receipts over the rest of the year, City economists say Mr Brown will be sitting on at least an extra \u00a310bn compared to his Budget forecast. His surplus is likely to be near \u00a315bn and may even be larger. A simple extrapolation from the surplus for the first five months of this year, suggests a surplus of \u00a324bn is possible. Richard Iley of the Dutch bank ABN-AMRO said: \"Faced with this embarrassment of riches and growing political problems, a tax cutting budget next March increasingly looks inevitable. But with the biggest fiscal stimulus for 25 years already in the pipeline, any further fiscal loosening will only further increase upward pressure on interest rates.\" That is Brown's dilemma. Although taxpayers are watching Mr Brown's every move, so too is the Bank of England.",

But in a statement yesterday he was forced to admit that he had discussed the donation with Tony Blair three days before the interview.</p> <p>On one of the roughest days in the political career of Labour's leading intellect, Mr Brown also faced accusations from petrol protesters that he was provoking civil disobedience by ruling out concessions on fuel duties.</p> <p>A meeting of Labour's national executive committee also heard demands from all wings of the party that the chancellor must restore the link between pension and earnings if the government is to head off an equally explosive pensions revolt.

      "bodyText": "The chancellor, Gordon Brown, was last night facing calls from the Conservative leadership to resign over allegations that he had lied about his knowledge of a donation to the Labour party from Formula One chief Bernie Ecclestone. During the height of the crisis almost three years ago, he said in a BBC interview he had not been told of the donation. But in a statement yesterday he was forced to admit that he had discussed the donation with Tony Blair three days before the interview. On one of the roughest days in the political career of Labour's leading intellect, Mr Brown also faced accusations from petrol protesters that he was provoking civil disobedience by ruling out concessions on fuel duties. A meeting of Labour's national executive committee also heard demands from all wings of the party that the chancellor must restore the link between pension and earnings if the government is to head off an equally explosive pensions revolt. The deputy prime minister John Prescott, promised to tell him of the strength of party feeling. Mr Brown has called a special meeting of the party's economy commission tomorrow where it is expected to start drafting a crucial statement on pensions designed to prevent a damaging defeat at next week's party conference. With Mr Brown's enemies at Westminster circling around him, the petrol protesters claimed that the chancellor's refusal to back down over duties indirectly led to yesterday's renewed panic buying of petrol across the country. The return of the queues, underlying the public's febrile mood, was triggered by false rumours on local Welsh radio that protesters were reinstating their blockade of refineries. The government's travails over fuel duties have already prompted one of the most sudden and spectacular reversals in a political party's poll fortunes. Today the Conservatives, buoyed by their four-point lead in yesterday's Guardian/ICM poll, will try to deepen Labour's agony by promising to cut fuel taxes if returned to power. Michael Portillo, the shadow chancellor, is expected to pledge the party to a cut of at least 5p a litre, and claim that the loss of \u00a32.5bn in revenue will not result in any cut in spending on schools, hospitals and other services. Tory advertisements are expected to target Mr Brown's \"intransigence\" in refusing to cut fuel duties. Yesterday, however, the chancellor was in the deepest immediate difficulty over his role in the Ecclestone affair. The allegations that Mr Brown and, to a lesser extent, the prime minister lied about their handling of the Formula One donations resurfaced when the Daily Mail published extracts from the book by Observer commentator Andrew Rawnsley. Labour is also bracing itself for further allegations when the Mail serialises a book written by Geoffrey Robinson, the former paymaster general. Labour sources estimate that the Mail has recently paid out nearly \u00a3500,000 in serialisation rights for books damaging the government. William Hague claimed the allegations that Mr Blair knowingly misled the public were the most serious made against a serving prime minister in living memory. Mr Portillo said Mr Brown had admitted he had lied on a matter of very important public policy. He should resign, or he should be sacked by the prime minister. \"You cannot have a chancellor of the exchequer whose word is not his bond,\" he said. During the BBC interview in 1997 Mr Brown was asked whether the party had received money from Mr Ecclestone. He replied: \"You'll have to wait and see, like I'll have to wait and see when the list [of donors giving more than \u00a35,000] is published because I've not been told and I certainly don't know what the true position is.\" At the time of Mr Brown's Today programme interview, the government had not con firmed the existence of the Ecclestone donation, let alone its size. Mr Brown's spokesman defended the answer, saying that he had not at the time known the full details of the donation. \"He knew the issue was a large corporate donation but he didn't know the full details,\" the spokesman said. \"Mr Brown had and has no responsibility in relation to Labour party donations and was never privy to the list of Labour donations prior to their publication.

The ruling is timely - it comes in the aftermath of the abject failure of the green movement to react during the fuel crisis. For the whole of last week, as protesters rallied and drivers complained of rising petrol prices (which have not risen since spring, but that did not stop anyone from spitting bile) environmentalists appeared cowed and silent. This week, their own brand of protest was upheld by Norwich crown court. While the people on the oil blockades claimed their protests were peaceful, they disrupted emergency services and schools and inconvenienced millions. But they, and the vast majority of the public who supported their case, claimed that they had a democratic right to object to fuel taxes. This democratic right they uphold is the right to expect no sacrifices for the future of the planet, merely to accelerate its descent into global warming and destructive freak weather conditions. The Melchett verdict proves there is another sort of democratic right - the right to act destructively, if such actions prevent the greater destruction of the environment. Norwich crown court decided that the rights of a farmer and the rights of a government are less significant than the rights of individuals to protest against the disruption of the balance of nature. Whether the jury agreed with the actions of Lord Melchett and his followers is not known, but they supported the spirit in which the demonstration was carried out. This is an extraordinary decision, which offers a substantial incentive for further field invasions and protests against experimental crop sites. Under government plans, 25 fields are to be planted with trial crops of maize and oilseed rape, and 30 more with either sugar or fodder beet by the end of this year.

William Hague called for an inquiry and the shadow chancellor, Michael Portillo, demanded Mr Browns resignation after the accusations in Observer columnist Andrew Rawnsleys book, Servants of the People, were splashed across four pages of the Daily Mail. Mr Rawnsleys version based on an analysis of statements made during the November 1997 sleaze crisis that engulfed what was supposed to be a squeaky clean government, and backed up by a series of anonymous quotes has revived the furore at the moment when the fuel crisis has left the government at its weakest. The Ecclestone affair erupted on November 9 1997, when the Sunday Telegraph revealed that the motor racing tycoon had switched his financial support from the Tories to Labour in what appeared an astonishing political u-turn. The papers then political correspondent, Tom Baldwin, had contacted Downing Street three days earlier after a tip-off and had been stonewalled.

Stung by leaks about the scale of the donations and Lord Neills advice that the money should be returned, Mr Blair attempted to draw a line under the affair. Mr Rawnsley alleges that the letter sent to Lord Neill about the donation did not refer to the original \u00a31m gift, but to a second one Mr Ecclestone planned to make.

      "bodyText": "A former aide to the Duchess of York, arrested on suspicion of murdering her boyfriend, was tonight in hospital after taking an overdose. Scotland Yard launched a nationwide search for Jane Andrews following her disappearance after the body of her 40-year-old partner Thomas Cressman was found at the couple's home in London. Ms Andrews, 33, who was once the Duchess of York's dresser, had disappeared from the house in Fulham, south west London, and the Metropolitan Police issued an all-ports alert to find her. She was found by officers today in a \"distressed state\". It is believed she had taken an overdose of the painkiller Nurofen, but was still conscious when found and an ambulance did not have to be called to the scene. She was taken by police to Derriford Hospital in Plymouth where she was undergoing medical tests. She was expected to remain in hospital for some time. Uniformed Devon and Cornwall Police officers in a patrol car spotted Ms Andrews's white VW Polo at 6.45am today, in a lay-by on the eastbound carriageway, near the Island Shop exit of the A38, near Liskeard. The officer spoke to her and she was arrested on suspicion of murder and taken to an undisclosed location. Although she was in the \"distressed state\", it is believed she was conscious and an ambulance was not called. Police are understood to have taken her to Derriford Hospital, Plymouth, for a medical examination. The Metropolitan Police was told of the arrest early this morning and officers were deciding when to travel to the south west to speak to Ms Andrews. Superintendent John Green, who is based at Liskeard, said: \"Officers carried out diligent searches throughout the night and once again good work by all officers has resulted in an arrest.\" Police were first alerted to Mr Cressman's death when a colleague of his visited the house, in Maltings Place, off Bagleys Lane, Fulham, on Monday afternoon. A post mortem examination at Fulham mortuary showed he was stabbed to death. Ms Andrews, now a sales assistant at the Theo Fennell jewellery shop in Fulham Road, worked for the Duchess of York for nine years until 1997, and accompanied the duke and duchess on foreign tours. She and Mr Cressman had been together for two years and had recently returned from a holiday in Italy and France. Detective chief inspector Jim Dickie said yesterday that officers were keeping an open mind as to the circumstances of Mr Cressman's death. Ms Andrews had reverted to using her maiden name after divorcing her husband, Christopher Dunn-Butler, in 1996. She hit the headlines in 1995 after \u00a3250,000-worth of the Duchess's jewellery was stolen by a baggage handler, from a suitcase which she checked into an aircraft hold in New York. The duchess yesterday expressed shock at the news of Mr Cressman's death.",

      "byline": "Bernadette Moore",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>When Polly Highton read the script for her current role in the Channel 4 soap Brookside, she went to pieces. The actress knew that her character, Barbara Newton, was a foster mum - but she had no idea that one of the children was deaf. </p> <p>For Polly's real-life son, Louis, is also deaf. \"I thought I had ruined my audition because my nerves went once I realised the screen foster child, Andrew, was deaf. But the part felt so right for me,\" says Polly who, with her actor/musician husband Paul, has a daughter, Nina, nine, as well as eight-year-old Louis. </p> <p>She believes her experience with Louis has enriched her understanding of the role. \"I instinctively knew how to relate to Andrew - always maintain eye contact and never talk with my back to him,\" she says. </p> <p>\"I am aware that deaf children's emotional development is slower and they can have behavioural problems. That helped me understand what my expectations of Andrew should be around the house.\" </p> <p>The storyline centres round allegations that Sinbad, one of the series' main characters, abused nine-year-old Andrew. We have now discovered that these rumours are false and that Kevin, Andrew's older brother, set Sinbad up because he felt he was getting too close to his little brother. </p> <p>Polly says she completely understands the dynamics of the relationships. \"It is very common for siblings of deaf children to be overprotective; my little girl Nina is just the same with Louis. When they are at parties or on trips out she assumes responsibility for him and has always got one eye on her brother.\" </p> <p>As a mother of both a hearing and a deaf child, Polly knows just how Barbara feels towards both children. \"When all the trouble started, Barbara felt guilty that she hadn't given Kevin enough attention and I totally appreciated what she was going through.

      "bodyText": "When Polly Highton read the script for her current role in the Channel 4 soap Brookside, she went to pieces. The actress knew that her character, Barbara Newton, was a foster mum - but she had no idea that one of the children was deaf. For Polly's real-life son, Louis, is also deaf. \"I thought I had ruined my audition because my nerves went once I realised the screen foster child, Andrew, was deaf. But the part felt so right for me,\" says Polly who, with her actor/musician husband Paul, has a daughter, Nina, nine, as well as eight-year-old Louis. She believes her experience with Louis has enriched her understanding of the role. \"I instinctively knew how to relate to Andrew - always maintain eye contact and never talk with my back to him,\" she says. \"I am aware that deaf children's emotional development is slower and they can have behavioural problems. That helped me understand what my expectations of Andrew should be around the house.\" The storyline centres round allegations that Sinbad, one of the series' main characters, abused nine-year-old Andrew. We have now discovered that these rumours are false and that Kevin, Andrew's older brother, set Sinbad up because he felt he was getting too close to his little brother. Polly says she completely understands the dynamics of the relationships. \"It is very common for siblings of deaf children to be overprotective; my little girl Nina is just the same with Louis. When they are at parties or on trips out she assumes responsibility for him and has always got one eye on her brother.\" As a mother of both a hearing and a deaf child, Polly knows just how Barbara feels towards both children. \"When all the trouble started, Barbara felt guilty that she hadn't given Kevin enough attention and I totally appreciated what she was going through. I have felt the same about Nina and I have had to take very special measures to ensure that she does not feel left out,\" she admits. Polly, who was born and raised in Liverpool, believes that Brookside has portrayed Andrew's deafness in the best possible way. \"A lot of soaps hammer home a disability or an issue but Andrew's deafness is just part of him. \"I was delighted that Andrew has hearing aids but that they're never referred to. Not to make a big deal of his deafness is far more true to life,\" she says. But Polly confesses that initially Louis's deafness, which is a lot worse than Andrew's, was a huge issue - one that dominated the family's life for several years. When he was diagnosed at nine months old, Polly and Paul were devastated. \"I still can't believe that we were told our baby boy was profoundly deaf and left to walk out of the hospital without any form of counselling or help.

And it is a credit to Polly that Louis, who goes to a partial-hearing unit attached to Gifford primary school in Northolt, is now a bright, happy child who loves talking. For 18 months she drove to Portsmouth twice a week to a pre-school centre for deaf children and their parents, where they both learned to deal with the practical and emotional problems of deafness.

Both foster and biological parents took to the media with a vengeance.\"Their argument is that if you allow spanking, you'll be able to recruit more parents,\" says Riak. \"Well, if you let drunk drivers drive, you'll have more drivers on the road. This is ridiculous. They are creating a ready-made defence for anyone who hurts a child.\" The pro-spankers argue that spanking is good discipline, teaching children that there are consequences to their actions. Riak scoffs at this, suggesting they are simply justifying their own bad parenting. The anti-spankers, including Project NoSpank and the Coalition for the Protection of Children in Foster Care, contend that, as many foster children are already the victims of physical and mental abuse, spanking will only increase their trauma. \"Spanking teaches children that might is right, that those bigger than you can inflict pain because of their size.\" \"We don't need the state to sanction corporal punishment, which will only invite more incompetence into child care. We need Virginia to spread the message that spanking is traumatic and dangerous for children, and hopefully other states will follow that lead.\"",

      "body": "<p>When my little boy is worried or upset, and I'm in bed with him comforting him, trying to make him feel better, he sometimes asks me when I'll die. He says he doesn't want me to die; he wants me always to look after him; if I have to die, he wants to die with me. At exactly the same time. </p> <p>These conversations are among the most difficult we have. I am desperate to comfort him, but I don't want to lie. So I tell him that most people live until they are 70 or 80. I tell him that most of us live until our children have their own children. Look at grandma and granddad, and nanny and grandpa, I say. They're still alive. They help me to look after you, and I'm looking forward to helping you look after your children. That's what normally happens, I tell him. </p> <p>And I remind him about all the wonderful people who love him and help look after him - his dad and his aunts and uncle, and his cousins. And we usually leave it at that. He drifts off to sleep and, lying next to him, I worry about what I've said and what I haven't said. I can't quite bring myself to say to him yet that there are other people who will look after him if I die. Yes, in a way it would be reassuring. But it also suggests that there is a chance that I might die when he is still a little child, and I don't want him to confront that. Not yet. </p> <p>This week there have been a hundred different photographic images of Paula Yates. Young, sexy Penthouse model, glitzy rock chick, grieving widow and desperate, dishevelled woman on the brink. The ones that stick in the memory, are those of her with a little girl in her arms, resting on her hip. A mother cuddling a little girl in long woolly tights and red T-bar shoes; a little girl with a crazy name who lost her father before she had a chance to know him and who found her mummy in deep, deep sleep in bed, surrounded by the debris of drink and drugs, and couldn't wake her. </p> <p>Perhaps Yates had the same conversation with her daughters on sleepless nights. \"What happens if you die, mummy?\" It's something every parent and every child consider at some point. </p> <p>But for most us, even as we consider it, we comfort ourselves that the odds are that it won't happen. I'm not lying to my son. Most of us do live until we are 70 or 80 and have become grandparents ourselves. But what happens to the sons and daughters of those of us who do not? What happens to Fifi Trixibelle, Peaches and Pixie, who fortunately have their father? What happens to Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily, who finds herself an orphan? </p> <p>Orphan. The very word sounds antique, Victorian. It doesn't belong to this era of medical miracles, healthier lifestyles and longer life expectancy. We hear it used in connection with the developing world, where parents die young and children grow up without them. But not here. </p> <p>Diana Crossley is a clinical psychologist working with Winston's Wish, a charity set up to try to help bereaved children and their families. In the eight years since the charity was launched, she and her colleagues have seen more than 2,000 children who have lost parents. Of those, only a handful have lost both: it is still mercifully rare. \"Your expectation is that your parents will survive until you are in your 40s or 50s before they die. So the impact of a parent dying when you are young is going to be huge. The full impact of both your parents dying by the time you are four is something you will have to deal with for the rest of your life. You question the world enough when one parent dies. To have both die, it's like - God, there really is nobody now.\" </p> <p>And what of the way that you die? To lose a parent after an illness is one thing - there will at least be time to prepare a child for their parent's death. But to die in despair, crippled by drink or drugs is another. Or is it? </p> <p>\"For a young child it is not necessarily always the way somebody dies that's the issue, it's the fact that they've died,\" says Crossley. \"When you are four it's the practicalities that matter. Where am I going to live? Is my routine going to carry on? Am I still going to have fishfingers for tea? It's those things that are important. It's not until they are five, six or seven that they start to respond in an emotional way and grieve. </p> <p>Dr Dora Black, consultant child psychiatrist, runs a clinic for children who have been exposed to death under acutely traumatic circumstances. Her patients have included the son of Rachel Nickell, who witnessed his mother being violently murdered on Wimbledon Common. Statistically, she says, a child who loses a parent is four or five times at greater risk of developing some kind of psychiatric disorder as they grow older, particularly depression. \"The most important factor is the adequacy of the substitute care arrangements that are made. Between the ages of three and four is probably the worst age at which something like this can happen. It's at the height of your attachment to that parent. But provided the child is well looked after by parent substitutes, and she has good-quality bereavement counselling, she has a good chance.\" </p> <p>Crossley adds: \"If nobody talks about it and it's brushed under the carpet, you are going to have problems later on. A lot of children are amazingly resilient. With the right support - and that's not years of therapy, but an openness, an honesty and a willingness to discuss what's happened - people can grow up and be the people they always would have been. </p> <p>\"You learn a lesson very early on that maybe you should not have had to learn until a lot later. Yes, you know life is not as safe as houses. But a lot of children we see become very compassionate, very caring to their peers who may experience something similar.\" </p> <p>So, just because one of your parents dies when you're a child doesn't mean that you grow up irreparably damaged. But throughout your life there will be those milestones when it's all much, much harder. The first day of school and your mother's not there; sports day and your dad's not in the crowd to see you win; getting married and he's not there to give you away; having your first child and she's not there to help you. It's a life-long adjustment. </p> <p>Every parent hopes his or her children will be spared, but there's no point in lying. When my son gets a bit older, and he can't sleep and he tells me that he's scared of me dying and being left on his own, I'll tell him again that most people live until they're 70 or 80. But occasionally - not very often - they don't. And if anything happens to me, isn't he lucky he's got a brilliant dad, and all those other fantastic people to care for him? He'll never be on his own.</p>",

Overhearing this exchange made my heart burst with joy: they clearly felt as bicultural and as bilingual as I did. All the effort was paying off. </p> <p>My French mother died some years ago, but I am in touch with her family, especially her sister. She and her husband have no children, so they are de facto surrogate grandparents to my children. Yet, as they speak no English, it would be inconceivable for any children of mine not to speak French if our frequent trips to see them were not to become hopelessly uncommunicative. I passionately wanted my children to have access to my French history and for me to maintain a bond with my mother. Our maternal language and culture is part of what defines us: I felt I owed it to my children to pass it on. </p> <p>From the moment my son was born, I vowed to speak to him only in French. Having grown up in a bilingual family, I knew the importance of consistency and firmness from the start. Nowadays, it would never occur to me to speak to my children in anything other than French. </p> <p>Only when their friends are round and I need everyone to understand do I switch to English, although I must admit it is particularly useful to be able to tell my children off in French: other people don't usually understand and my children do not lose face. </p> <p>On a day-to-day basis, as my husband understands French, we have developed triangular conversations: my children and I speak to each other in French, they communicate with their father in English and he and I speak in English as well. </p> <p>This system works so smoothly that we are not even conscious of it, although some outsiders find it bewildering to understand only half of our exchanges - a little like hearing one half of a telephone conversation. </p> <p>However, now that school is encroaching on the children's lives, they are beginning to tell me things in English as well. Understandably, if you've been talking all day about Jigglypuff and Charmander, it's a pain to translate that into Roudoudou and Salam\u00e8che. I remember driving my mother to total distraction when I used to come home from school and answer her automatically in English, despite being spoken to in French. </p> <p>I was not doing it maliciously. I was simply living and breathing English all day long. So when the children speak English to me, I ask them to repeat their English sentence in French. I try to turn the whole exercise into a game, help them to remember any words they are searching for, and endlessly heap praise on them. </p> <p>This may sound distinctly cumbersome but children will take as normal any pattern which is established at home, so mine are well used to having to do a bit of simultaneous translation over tea. I draw the line, however, at doing maths homework in French, unless my son tips subconsciously into that language whilst doing his sums. </p> <p>Speaking is one thing, but a country's language is indivisible from its culture. To successfully pass on the former implies passing on the latter on as well. So it was that I introduced my children to French nursery rhymes and children's books (to this day I have only ever read a handful of English books to them) as well as food and even - don't laugh - music. I am proud to say that the children now love singing along to 70s cool dude Jacques Dutronc, complete with his deeply sexist but ironic \"J'aime les filles\" (it's all in the lyrics, believe me). </p> <p>As culture is also a way of life, we now go to France every school holiday, and last year we spent the four-month ski season in our alpine village, during which time the children went to the local \u00e9cole maternelle (infant school) and made many firm friends. That, as much as anything, cemented in their minds the notion that they were both French and English, as it had done for me when I had done similar stints in French schools as a child. Once a child feels proud to be part of a country, he or she will want to keep speaking its language. </p> <p>I am regularly asked whether my children ever get muddled between the two languages. Although my children would say, particularly when they were younger, \"sauce tomato\" or \"switch off the fire\"(as in \" \u00e9teindre le feu \"), they have known ever since they were two that fire is English and feu is French. I confess that I too still come out with occasional Anglicisms in French and Gallicisms in English but I consider that a price worth paying for feeling at ease in two languages in all other respects. </p> <p>Yes, they probably were slower to speak than their monolingual friends. Indeed, I remember a well-meaning health visitor who recommended that we see a speech therapist when my daughter spectacularly failed to mumble more than a few words in either language at her two-year health check. \"Well,\" she sighed, \"it's not normal not to know the word for cupboard and chair at this age.\" </p> <p>I ignored her and, needless to say, Natasha now suffers from severe verbal diarrhoea. Others were less fortunate. I know of two cases where the parents of three-year-old children whose speech was not as developed as that of their peers were told by speech therapists to drop temporarily the second language, even though in both cases it was the maternal language. Sadly, by the time their English improved (which it probably would have done with time and speech therapy alone), the link with the mother's language had been broken and was never fully re-established. </p> <p>As for the common fear that a child might one day reject one of the languages, either as a reaction against a parent or out of embarrassment, I can confirm that there were indeed periods (in adolescence, especially) when I did not speak much French. However, it was sufficiently part of my life that the hiatus was only ever temporary. Anyway, let's face it: a teenager has to react against something and if it isn't their parent's language, it will be something else. </p> <p>Bringing up truly bilingual and bicultural children can be achieved, but it is not a task for the faint-hearted. It requires much effort and determination and, once begun, it is not easy to backtrack. There are downsides, naturally, some of which I have experienced myself, but these have been hugely outweighed by the enjoyment and enrichment that bilingualism brings. </p> <p>I want my children to have all the same opportunities as I have had. I would also like in some way to repay my mother for all the years of hard work she put into me.

The Olympics rallied at 7.30pm, however, to battle neck and neck with The Bill until 8pm and peaking at 8.1m. The last in the two-part special of Bafta-winning The Cops beat last night's pull of 1.7m by 100,000, with viewers possibly defecting to Channel 4's acclaimed documentary series, A Very British Murder, which attracted 2.3m viewers, a 10% share of the available audience. In the mornings, The Big Breakfast's downward plunge continues apace, with the Channel 4 breakfast programme again struggling at 8am.",

      "trailText": "<p>\n   <strong>Derbyshire</strong></p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p> <strong>Derbyshire</strong></p> <p> <strong> Ch'ship Div 1</strong> 9th <br> <strong> NCL Div 2 </strong> 9th <br> <strong> B&amp;H </strong> Group stage <br> <strong> NatWest </strong> 4th round </p> <p> How to put this politely? Even without the usual bouts of back-stabbing and bile, Derbyshire still managed to self-destruct: bottom of both leagues, just seven wins in all competitions, eight points deducted for a dodgy wicket, and a batting line-up that often made West Indies look like Australia. One collapse, against Surrey, from 68 for 0 to 97 all out (Saqlain Mushtaq 7-11) plumbed the darkest depths. The seam bowling (they don't do spin in Derby) fell short of its customary penetration, and no-one took more wickets than Kevin Dean's 38. It's hard to know where Derbyshire go from here (apart from the second division of the Championship), especially as Dominic Cork could miss a big chunk of next season on England duty.<br> <strong> Most memorable moment </strong> Cork's 200* against Durham, shortly before going in at No.9 for England in the fifth Test <br> <strong> Biggest disappointment </strong> Michael Di Venuto, whose total of 725 runs at 32.95 was a poor return for an overseas player </p> <p> <strong> Durham </strong></p> <p> <strong> Ch'ship Div 1 </strong> 8th <br> <strong> NCL Div 2 </strong> 7th <br> <strong> B&amp;H </strong> Q-Final <br> <strong> NatWest </strong> 4th round </p> <p> After the big strides under little David Boon, Durham took two steps back this summer, losing 20 games in the two leagues - a figure matched only by Hampshire. The bowling wasn't a problem: Simon Brown took 50-plus wickets yet again, and Melvyn Betts, John Wood and Steve Harmison were always a handful on the moist strips at The Riverside. The batting, though, was dreadful. Only Western Australia's Simon Katich (1089 runs at 43.56) averaged more than 30, and five times Durham failed to reach 100 in the Championship. After that illusory triumph over Surrey in the opening match of the season, there was just one more first-class win. Grim stuff up North.<br> <strong> Most memorable moment </strong> Eighteen-year-old Nicky Peng's <a href=\"http://www.wisden.com/Story_Co_Brand/0,5642,218604,00.html\"> matchwinning 98</a> in that win over Surrey <br> <strong> Biggest disappointment </strong> Peng's subsequent failure to pass 23 in his remaining 13 Championship innings </p> <p> <strong> Essex </strong></p> <p> <strong> Ch'ship Div 2 </strong> 2nd <br> <strong> NCL Div 2 </strong> 5th <br> <strong> B&amp;H </strong> Group stage <br> <strong> NatWest </strong> 4th round</p> <p> As for Essex, read Ronnie Irani. Ten scores of fifty or more in 28 knocks at 55.95, plus 42 wickets at 24.00 was one of the main reasons why Essex sneaked into Division One of the Championship. The other was Stuart Law who churned out the runs (1352 at 56.33) with the appetite of a man who desperately hungers for international recognition. Australia's loss has been Essex's gain. But if they're going to survive in the upper echelon, they'll need another wicket-taker (apart from Irani, only Ashley Cowan, with 47, claimed more than 34 victims), and another batsman to score heavily. Stephen Peters, who dazzled Warwickshire on the final day of the season with 77*, could be the man.<br> <strong> Most memorable moment </strong> Warwickshire's generous declaration in the same game which left Essex needing 201 from 56 overs to secure promotion. They did it with more than 17 overs to spare <br> <strong> Biggest disappointment </strong> Poor old Nasser, whose cobbled together just 41 runs in five innings </p> <p> <strong> Glamorgan </strong></p> <p> <strong> Ch'ship Div </strong> 2 3rd <br> <strong> NCL Div 2 </strong> 6th <br> <strong> B&amp;H </strong> Final <br> <strong> NatWest </strong> Q-Final</p> <p> Not quite the golden summer of 1997, but promotion, a Lord's final and the first triple-century in the county's 79-year Championship career will do nicely, boyo. At one point it looked like it would be even better: four wins in July, including successful run-chases of over 300 in consecutive matches, rocketed Glamorgan to the top of Division Two. In the end, though, they needed bonus points at the death against Middlesex to go up. Matthew Elliott was outstanding (four hundreds, 1042 runs, average 54.84) and at last they seem to have found a keeper who can bat: Adrian Shaw may not be a Colin Metson behind the stumps, but an average of 42.30 says he knows which end of a bat to hold. The bowling, again led by Steady Steve Watkin (48 wickets at 22.22) was good enough this year, but will need more firepower in 2001.<br> <strong> Most memorable moment </strong> Steve James's 309* out of 718 for 3 against Sussex at Colwyn Bay, and Matthew Maynard's 109 off 115 balls against Surrey in the B&amp;H semis<br> <strong> Biggest disappointment </strong> The batting of two young hopefuls, Alun Evans and Wayne Law, who totalled 130 runs from 13 innings. And Robert Croft's outburst after being - deservedly - dropped by England.</p> <p> <strong> Gloucestershire </strong></p> <p> <strong> Ch'ship Div 2 </strong> 4th <br> <strong> NCL Div 1 </strong> Winners <br> <strong> B&amp;H </strong> Winners <br> <strong> NatWest </strong> Winners</p> <p> Get the sports psychologists down to Bristol and bottle whatever it is they drink. A team whose captain is nicknamed Boo Boo and whose biggest star is a piece of frozen poultry (the magic chicken attended all their games en route to Lord's) lifted all three one-day cups to go with the two they won last season. And they missed out on promotion to the first division of the Championship by only two points, despite winning one more game than third-placed Glamorgan. Aussie Ian Harvey's slower one became as almost as famous as Franklyn Stephenson's, and Mike Smith was unhittable with the new ball. The batting was vibrant when the maximum was 50 overs, but in the longer form no-one scored more than Matt Windows's 790. Jon Lewis (56 wickets at 22.94) was consistently incisive and Jack Russell more mischievously brilliant than ever.<br> <strong> Most memorable moment </strong> Leicestershire's failure to score 20 runs off five overs with five wickets left in the NatWest fourth round. Gloster really began to believe this was their year <br> <strong> Biggest disappointment </strong> The collective failure of the batsmen in the Championship. Only three passed 500 runs.</p> <p> <strong> Hampshire </strong></p> <p> <strong> Ch'ship Div 1 </strong> 7th <br> <strong> NCL Div 2 </strong> 8th <br> <strong> B&amp;H </strong> Q-Final <br> <strong> NatWest </strong> S-Final </p> <p> A season that began with a bang ended with a whimper as Hampshire joined Derbyshire and Durham in the bottom three in both their leagues. No team in either division secured more than Hampshire's 48 bowling points but only two (Kent and Derbyshire) scored fewer than their 20 in the batting. It was just awful. Lawrence Prittipaul came in at the end and did well, and Will Kendall (979 runs at 39.16) improved as the season went on, but the rest were nowhere. When he wasn't losing his rag with journalists, Robin Smith was on his way to an average of less than 20 and there were just six first-class tons to speak of. Shane Warne (70 at 23.14) and Alan Mullally (49 at 16.97) took more than half the wickets and all but one of the 11 five-fors between them. Even if Warne does return, it's hard to see Hampshire escaping from the lower league next season.<br> <strong> Most memorable moment </strong> The arrival of Warne <br> <strong> Biggest disappointment </strong> Losing to Surrey by two runs at the beginning of June when a win might have kickstarted Hampshire's season </p> <p><strong> Kent </strong></p> <p> <strong> Ch'ship Div 1 </strong> 6th <br> <strong> NCL Div 2 </strong> 5th <br> <strong> B&amp;H </strong> Group stage <br> <strong> NatWest </strong> 4th round</p> <p> On the face of it a faceless season, but when you're missing two of your strike bowlers (Dean Headley and Dr Julian Thompson) for the entire time, and one of them (Martin McCague) for most of it, survival becomes the aim. Kent achieved that in both leagues with a little to spare. A few players shone, none more brightly than the Star of India, Rahul Dravid, who overcame a sticky start in damp Canterbury to average nigh on 50 and score almost twice as many runs as the next man - Robert Key with 558. Kent's total of 18 batting points was the lowest in the country. The bowling was held together by the under-rated Martin Saggers (57 wickets at 20.14), but Kent were ill-equipped to bowl out the best sides twice: their four wins all came against the three sides who came below them. Still, at least Paul Nixon was finally picked for England.<br> <strong> Most memorable moment </strong> Beating relegation rivals Hampshire by 15 runs at the end of August. A 24-point swing helped them finish 28 points clear by the end <br> <strong> Biggest disappointment </strong> The young guns: Ed Smith, Matthew Walker, Key and David Fulton, who between them scored 1971 runs at 23.19 </p> <p><strong> Lancashire </strong></p> <p> <strong> Ch'ship Div 1 </strong> 2nd <br> <strong> NCL Div 1 </strong> 8th <br> <strong> B&amp;H </strong> S-Final <br> <strong> NatWest </strong> S-Final</p> <p> England thought 31 years were painful enough. For Lancashire the wait is more than double that - it's now 66 years since they last won the title outright. And they've become so obsessed that they even forgot how to win one-day games, although long-term injuries to Peter Martin and Ian Austin gave them an excuse. No Lord's final and, even more amazingly, relegation from the top flight of the National League, a competition that used to be theirs by right. Clearly second best to Surrey in the Championship, Lancashire lacked a few vital ingredients: a successful and popular overseas player (Sourav Ganguly's top score was 99, he kept running people out, and on one occasion he turned to salute the team balcony after reaching a one-day fifty, only to find it empty); a genuine strike bowler (Mike Smethurst picked up 43 wickets, Glen Chapple 44); and a free-scoring batsman (Neil Fairbrother's tally of 754 was the best).<br> <strong> Most memorable moment </strong> Andy Flintoff's 135* from 111 balls in the NatWest quarter-final thrashing of Surrey at The Oval, an innings described by Viv Richards as \"awesome\"<br> <strong> Biggest disappointment </strong> The increasingly obvious rift between Ganguly and the others. Can one man really be so aloof he has to be ostracised?</p> <p> <strong> Leicestershire </strong></p> <p> <strong> Ch'ship Div 1 </strong> 4th <br> <strong> NCL Div 1 </strong> 4th <br> <strong> B&amp;H </strong> Group stage <br> <strong> NatWest </strong> 4th round</p> <p> Mid-table but not mediocre, solid but not spectacular. Leicestershire were 23 points behind Yorkshire in third, but another 20 ahead of Somerset in fifth. They knew it wasn't going to be their season when old foes Surrey racked up 505 at Oakham School and then skittled them for 143 and 184. Five draws followed in eight games and Leicestershire settled for safety. The problem was that Anil Kumble (45 wickets at 25.17) didn't come close to his annus mirabilis in 1995 when he picked up 105 scalps for Northants. The rest of the bowling was below par too: Phil DeFreitas took 33 wickets at a rate of one every 14 overs and generally looked more of a batsman, while no-one averaged less than 25.

Michael Bevan, with five Championship tons and more runs in the National League (706 at 117.67) than anyone else, held things together for a while with a little help from Chris Adams. But when he disappeared on international duty, Sussex fell apart, losing two games in a week to Northants and starting a slide that even Bevan was unable to halt when he returned. At least the bowling had two dimensions to it: James Kirtley (63 wickets at 24.74) and Jason Lewry (51 at 29.54), but that was it.

But things didn't work out in the final day melting-pot and promotion in the one-day league along with defeat in the NatWest Final had to do. Warwickshire fell short chiefly because their often absent new-ball pairing of Allan Donald and Ed Giddins took just 38 wickets between them. Ashley Giles was a revelation with ball (52 wickets at 23.07) and bat (444 runs at 40.36), and Dominic Ostler (1021 at 48.61) returned to form in his benefit year. But however many runs they scored, they rarely took enough wickets.

By the middle of June Worcester were top of two divisions and could do no wrong. But like Sussex, they haemorrhaged badly after losing Glenn McGrath for a fortnight and went into terminal decline, failing to win any of their last nine National League matches and bowling like Sri Lanka might without Muralitharan in the Championship. They even had to replay their third-round NatWest match with Gloucestershire after one of their players was ruled ineligible. They lost. McGrath shouldered the burden of a weak attack like the champion he is, taking 76 wickets at 13.77, and without the support of Stuart Lampitt (50 at 21.00) and the runs of Vikram Solanki (1062 at 46.17), Worcestershire would have been in even deeper trouble.<br> <strong> Most memorable moment</strong> McGrath charging in for one last effort on the final day of the season and picking up 8-41 against Northants as Worcestershire tried in vain to secure a promotion place <br> <strong> Biggest disappointment</strong> Alamgir Sheriyar, who took 59 fewer wickets than in 1999 (27 to 86) and ended up being allowed to leave </p> <p> <strong> Yorkshire </strong></p> <p> <strong> Ch'ship Div 1 </strong> 3rd <br> <strong> NCL Div 1 </strong> 2nd <br> <strong> B&amp;H </strong> Q-Final <br> <strong> NatWest </strong> Q-Final </p> <p> Every season Yorkshire convince themselves that this time, surely this time, we'll do it. So while most counties would be doing cartwheels after coming third and second in the two leagues, the Yorkies think they've failed again. In truth, they did pretty well. Their batting was increasingly reliant on the prolific Darren Lehmann (1477 runs at 67.13) and, when he was available, Michael Vaughan (697 at 49.78), while the seam bowling remains over-rated - often devastating at Headingley, not quite so efficient elsewhere. In fact no-one passed 50 wickets (Matthew Hoggard's haul of 46 was the biggest), and Yorkshire should take most heart from the performance of their offspinner James Middlebrook (27 wickets at 24.07).

      "bodyText": "Derbyshire Ch'ship Div 1 9th NCL Div 2 9th B&amp;H Group stage NatWest 4th round How to put this politely? Even without the usual bouts of back-stabbing and bile, Derbyshire still managed to self-destruct: bottom of both leagues, just seven wins in all competitions, eight points deducted for a dodgy wicket, and a batting line-up that often made West Indies look like Australia. One collapse, against Surrey, from 68 for 0 to 97 all out (Saqlain Mushtaq 7-11) plumbed the darkest depths. The seam bowling (they don't do spin in Derby) fell short of its customary penetration, and no-one took more wickets than Kevin Dean's 38. It's hard to know where Derbyshire go from here (apart from the second division of the Championship), especially as Dominic Cork could miss a big chunk of next season on England duty. Most memorable moment Cork's 200* against Durham, shortly before going in at No.9 for England in the fifth Test Biggest disappointment Michael Di Venuto, whose total of 725 runs at 32.95 was a poor return for an overseas player Durham Ch'ship Div 1 8th NCL Div 2 7th B&amp;H Q-Final NatWest 4th round After the big strides under little David Boon, Durham took two steps back this summer, losing 20 games in the two leagues - a figure matched only by Hampshire. The bowling wasn't a problem: Simon Brown took 50-plus wickets yet again, and Melvyn Betts, John Wood and Steve Harmison were always a handful on the moist strips at The Riverside. The batting, though, was dreadful. Only Western Australia's Simon Katich (1089 runs at 43.56) averaged more than 30, and five times Durham failed to reach 100 in the Championship. After that illusory triumph over Surrey in the opening match of the season, there was just one more first-class win. Grim stuff up North. Most memorable moment Eighteen-year-old Nicky Peng's matchwinning 98 in that win over Surrey Biggest disappointment Peng's subsequent failure to pass 23 in his remaining 13 Championship innings Essex Ch'ship Div 2 2nd NCL Div 2 5th B&amp;H Group stage NatWest 4th round As for Essex, read Ronnie Irani. Ten scores of fifty or more in 28 knocks at 55.95, plus 42 wickets at 24.00 was one of the main reasons why Essex sneaked into Division One of the Championship. The other was Stuart Law who churned out the runs (1352 at 56.33) with the appetite of a man who desperately hungers for international recognition. Australia's loss has been Essex's gain. But if they're going to survive in the upper echelon, they'll need another wicket-taker (apart from Irani, only Ashley Cowan, with 47, claimed more than 34 victims), and another batsman to score heavily. Stephen Peters, who dazzled Warwickshire on the final day of the season with 77*, could be the man. Most memorable moment Warwickshire's generous declaration in the same game which left Essex needing 201 from 56 overs to secure promotion. They did it with more than 17 overs to spare Biggest disappointment Poor old Nasser, whose cobbled together just 41 runs in five innings Glamorgan Ch'ship Div 2 3rd NCL Div 2 6th B&amp;H Final NatWest Q-Final Not quite the golden summer of 1997, but promotion, a Lord's final and the first triple-century in the county's 79-year Championship career will do nicely, boyo. At one point it looked like it would be even better: four wins in July, including successful run-chases of over 300 in consecutive matches, rocketed Glamorgan to the top of Division Two. In the end, though, they needed bonus points at the death against Middlesex to go up. Matthew Elliott was outstanding (four hundreds, 1042 runs, average 54.84) and at last they seem to have found a keeper who can bat: Adrian Shaw may not be a Colin Metson behind the stumps, but an average of 42.30 says he knows which end of a bat to hold. The bowling, again led by Steady Steve Watkin (48 wickets at 22.22) was good enough this year, but will need more firepower in 2001. Most memorable moment Steve James's 309* out of 718 for 3 against Sussex at Colwyn Bay, and Matthew Maynard's 109 off 115 balls against Surrey in the B&amp;H semis Biggest disappointment The batting of two young hopefuls, Alun Evans and Wayne Law, who totalled 130 runs from 13 innings. And Robert Croft's outburst after being - deservedly - dropped by England. Gloucestershire Ch'ship Div 2 4th NCL Div 1 Winners B&amp;H Winners NatWest Winners Get the sports psychologists down to Bristol and bottle whatever it is they drink. A team whose captain is nicknamed Boo Boo and whose biggest star is a piece of frozen poultry (the magic chicken attended all their games en route to Lord's) lifted all three one-day cups to go with the two they won last season. And they missed out on promotion to the first division of the Championship by only two points, despite winning one more game than third-placed Glamorgan. Aussie Ian Harvey's slower one became as almost as famous as Franklyn Stephenson's, and Mike Smith was unhittable with the new ball. The batting was vibrant when the maximum was 50 overs, but in the longer form no-one scored more than Matt Windows's 790. Jon Lewis (56 wickets at 22.94) was consistently incisive and Jack Russell more mischievously brilliant than ever. Most memorable moment Leicestershire's failure to score 20 runs off five overs with five wickets left in the NatWest fourth round. Gloster really began to believe this was their year Biggest disappointment The collective failure of the batsmen in the Championship. Only three passed 500 runs. Hampshire Ch'ship Div 1 7th NCL Div 2 8th B&amp;H Q-Final NatWest S-Final A season that began with a bang ended with a whimper as Hampshire joined Derbyshire and Durham in the bottom three in both their leagues. No team in either division secured more than Hampshire's 48 bowling points but only two (Kent and Derbyshire) scored fewer than their 20 in the batting. It was just awful. Lawrence Prittipaul came in at the end and did well, and Will Kendall (979 runs at 39.16) improved as the season went on, but the rest were nowhere. When he wasn't losing his rag with journalists, Robin Smith was on his way to an average of less than 20 and there were just six first-class tons to speak of. Shane Warne (70 at 23.14) and Alan Mullally (49 at 16.97) took more than half the wickets and all but one of the 11 five-fors between them. Even if Warne does return, it's hard to see Hampshire escaping from the lower league next season. Most memorable moment The arrival of Warne Biggest disappointment Losing to Surrey by two runs at the beginning of June when a win might have kickstarted Hampshire's season Kent Ch'ship Div 1 6th NCL Div 2 5th B&amp;H Group stage NatWest 4th round On the face of it a faceless season, but when you're missing two of your strike bowlers (Dean Headley and Dr Julian Thompson) for the entire time, and one of them (Martin McCague) for most of it, survival becomes the aim. Kent achieved that in both leagues with a little to spare. A few players shone, none more brightly than the Star of India, Rahul Dravid, who overcame a sticky start in damp Canterbury to average nigh on 50 and score almost twice as many runs as the next man - Robert Key with 558. Kent's total of 18 batting points was the lowest in the country. The bowling was held together by the under-rated Martin Saggers (57 wickets at 20.14), but Kent were ill-equipped to bowl out the best sides twice: their four wins all came against the three sides who came below them. Still, at least Paul Nixon was finally picked for England. Most memorable moment Beating relegation rivals Hampshire by 15 runs at the end of August. A 24-point swing helped them finish 28 points clear by the end Biggest disappointment The young guns: Ed Smith, Matthew Walker, Key and David Fulton, who between them scored 1971 runs at 23.19 Lancashire Ch'ship Div 1 2nd NCL Div 1 8th B&amp;H S-Final NatWest S-Final England thought 31 years were painful enough. For Lancashire the wait is more than double that - it's now 66 years since they last won the title outright. And they've become so obsessed that they even forgot how to win one-day games, although long-term injuries to Peter Martin and Ian Austin gave them an excuse. No Lord's final and, even more amazingly, relegation from the top flight of the National League, a competition that used to be theirs by right. Clearly second best to Surrey in the Championship, Lancashire lacked a few vital ingredients: a successful and popular overseas player (Sourav Ganguly's top score was 99, he kept running people out, and on one occasion he turned to salute the team balcony after reaching a one-day fifty, only to find it empty); a genuine strike bowler (Mike Smethurst picked up 43 wickets, Glen Chapple 44); and a free-scoring batsman (Neil Fairbrother's tally of 754 was the best). Most memorable moment Andy Flintoff's 135* from 111 balls in the NatWest quarter-final thrashing of Surrey at The Oval, an innings described by Viv Richards as \"awesome\" Biggest disappointment The increasingly obvious rift between Ganguly and the others. Can one man really be so aloof he has to be ostracised? Leicestershire Ch'ship Div 1 4th NCL Div 1 4th B&amp;H Group stage NatWest 4th round Mid-table but not mediocre, solid but not spectacular. Leicestershire were 23 points behind Yorkshire in third, but another 20 ahead of Somerset in fifth. They knew it wasn't going to be their season when old foes Surrey racked up 505 at Oakham School and then skittled them for 143 and 184. Five draws followed in eight games and Leicestershire settled for safety. The problem was that Anil Kumble (45 wickets at 25.17) didn't come close to his annus mirabilis in 1995 when he picked up 105 scalps for Northants. The rest of the bowling was below par too: Phil DeFreitas took 33 wickets at a rate of one every 14 overs and generally looked more of a batsman, while no-one averaged less than 25. Rumours are that Lance Klusener might be gracing Grace Road next season. It looks a canny move, but they need wickets, not quick runs. Most memorable moment Aftab Habib's 172* early on against Somerset. It showed he wasn't too traumatised by his England experience last summer Biggest disappointment Darren Maddy, whose tally of 581 runs at 26.40 suggests he may have well have been traumatised by his England experience last winter Middlesex Ch'ship Div 2 8th NCL Div 2 4th B&amp;H Group stage NatWest Q-Final Oh dear. Despite Herculean performances from four players, Middlesex continued on the downward slope they began two years ago. Justin Langer (1472 runs) and Mark Ramprakash (1088) averaged more than 60, while Phil Tunfell (65 wickets) and Angus Fraser (48) averaged under 24, but there was precious little else to get excited about. Richard Johnson took 50 wickets and Andrew Strauss is an opener for the future, but Middlesex usually looked like small fish in a big pond, especially when early-season downpours limited their B&amp;H experience to 127 all out against Kent. It was also the end of an era: Mike Gatting, a pillar of the club for 25 years, was sacked as coach before the end of the season. His successor will have a tough job, though he could start by leaving Lord's, which seems to be doing to Middlesex what it used to do to England. Most memorable moment Ramprakash's run of scores after being dropped by England: 101, 83, 40, 110*, 112, 84, 49. Mental glitches are temporary, class is permanent Biggest disappointment The NatWest quarter-final defeat by Hampshire, when Middlesex were dismissed for 127 - again. Northamptonshire Ch'ship Div 2 Winners NCL Div 1 3rd B&amp;H Group stage NatWest Q-Final Only Gloucestershire and Surrey had better summers. But Northants had been in real trouble. They began the National League with four straight defeats and by the first week in June were bottom of the Championship. Oxford Universities had beaten them as well. Then the Wantage Road worm turned. Out went Devon Malcolm and left-arm spinner Michael Davies, who had an attack of the yips, and in came left-arm seamer Paul Taylor, back from injury, and Jason Brown. Brown pitched into Taylor's footmarks, picked up 50 wickets in seven games, and, with the batting re-energised, Northants won five Championship games on the trot and nine of their last 12 one-day league games. Their one worry is that captain Matthew Hayden (1270 runs at 57.72) is likely to be on Ashes duty with Australia next summer. Most memorable moment Reducing Sussex to 13 for 6 on the way to 65 all out in a crucial match at Eastbourne Biggest disappointment Mal Loye, who failed to pass reach 100 in 18 innings and was eventually dropped. Another promising player bites the county dust. Nottinghamshire Ch'ship Div 2 7th NCL Div 2 2nd B&amp;H Group stage NatWest 3rd round They used to look over their shoulders at the glory years of Richard Hadlee and Clive Rice in the early '80s.

But they really need some young blood in a top order that contains Darren Bicknell (aged 33), John Morris (36) and Paul Johnson (35). Most memorable moment The opening stand of 406* against Warwickshire by Bicknell (180*) and Guy Welton (200*) Biggest disappointment Failure to make the most of the greentops regularly seen at Trent Bridge Somerset Ch'ship Div 1 5th NCL Div 1 6th B&amp;H Group stage NatWest 4th round Not good enough to challenge for honours, but not bad enough to go down, Somerset, like Leicestershire and Kent, were the mid-table men.

Surrey Ch'ship Div 1 Winners NCL Div 2 Winners B&amp;H S-Final NatWest Q-Final We always knew that it's bowlers who win matches, but Surrey reminded us that they can win trophies too. While no-one reached 1000 runs, four men took 47 wickets or more. And they did it as West Indies used to do it - hunting in pairs of pairs.

Beautiful, clinical and irresistible. Put your money on Surrey to make it three in a row in 2001, something no side has managed since Yorkshire in 1966-68. Most memorable moment Ally Brown's 295* against Leicestershire at Oakham School, an innings that surgically took care of one potential rival Biggest disappointment The decline and fall of Ben Hollioake (142 runs and 11 wickets). A change of county could be the solution. Sussex Ch'ship Div 2 9th NCL Div 1 9th B&amp;H Q-Final NatWest 4th round As close to a one-man batting line-up as any on the circuit. Michael Bevan, with five Championship tons and more runs in the National League (706 at 117.67) than anyone else, held things together for a while with a little help from Chris Adams.

Ashley Giles was a revelation with ball (52 wickets at 23.07) and bat (444 runs at 40.36), and Dominic Ostler (1021 at 48.61) returned to form in his benefit year. But however many runs they scored, they rarely took enough wickets. The result was 11 draws in 16 games. Most memorable moment Giles's figures of 8-90 at Northampton, which moved him instantly up the spin-bowling pecking-order Biggest disappointment The disintegration of Giddins, from Man of the Match in the first Test against Zimbabwe at Lord's to not being offered a new contract at the end of the season Worcestershire Ch'ship Div 2 5th NCL Div 1 7th B&amp;H Group stage NatWest 3rd round A season of two halves. By the middle of June Worcester were top of two divisions and could do no wrong. But like Sussex, they haemorrhaged badly after losing Glenn McGrath for a fortnight and went into terminal decline, failing to win any of their last nine National League matches and bowling like Sri Lanka might without Muralitharan in the Championship. They even had to replay their third-round NatWest match with Gloucestershire after one of their players was ruled ineligible. They lost. McGrath shouldered the burden of a weak attack like the champion he is, taking 76 wickets at 13.77, and without the support of Stuart Lampitt (50 at 21.00) and the runs of Vikram Solanki (1062 at 46.17), Worcestershire would have been in even deeper trouble. Most memorable moment McGrath charging in for one last effort on the final day of the season and picking up 8-41 against Northants as Worcestershire tried in vain to secure a promotion place Biggest disappointment Alamgir Sheriyar, who took 59 fewer wickets than in 1999 (27 to 86) and ended up being allowed to leave Yorkshire Ch'ship Div 1 3rd NCL Div 1 2nd B&amp;H Q-Final NatWest Q-Final Every season Yorkshire convince themselves that this time, surely this time, we'll do it. So while most counties would be doing cartwheels after coming third and second in the two leagues, the Yorkies think they've failed again. In truth, they did pretty well. Their batting was increasingly reliant on the prolific Darren Lehmann (1477 runs at 67.13) and, when he was available, Michael Vaughan (697 at 49.78), while the seam bowling remains over-rated - often devastating at Headingley, not quite so efficient elsewhere. In fact no-one passed 50 wickets (Matthew Hoggard's haul of 46 was the biggest), and Yorkshire should take most heart from the performance of their offspinner James Middlebrook (27 wickets at 24.07). Overall, they are still in Surrey's shadow. Most memorable moment The Headingley Test, when local lads Darren Gough, Vaughan and Craig White did the Western Terrace proud Biggest disappointment The batting of Richard Blakey, who averaged just 17.46 despite being given numerous chances to build an innings at No.3 and ended up in the seconds.

These range from Tower Hamlets and Brent, in London, to south Wales, Middlesbrough and Glasgow. </p> <p>The company works with individuals who have been unemployed for at least 12 or 18 months, depending on the zone, although in practice many individuals have been out of work for far longer periods. Smith argues that the success of the scheme is largely attributable to the greater flexibility and risk-taking ethos of the company, compared with the more bureaucratic and constrained ES, which runs much of the New Deal programme. </p> <p>Because the company is paid by results, rather than how it gets those results, it has been free to develop an innovative approach.

That risk-taking would be very hard for a public sector organisation to justify, but we've found that on balance it works well.\" </p> <p>As an example of how jobseekers are treated as individuals, he cites the example of the Brent scheme, where new referrals are treated conspicuously courteously, offered tea or coffee and asked to wait on the sofa to meet their personal adviser. \"Many of these individuals are not used to being treated like that and it helps our advisers to build up a rapport with them quickly,\" says Smith. </p> <p>The company's management team is made up of former ES staff as well as people from Manpower and Cap Gemini Ernst &amp; Young. Five of the nine zone directors are ex-ES staff. \"Six months ago these people were civil servants who wished they could be more innovative in areas like aftercare, but were constrained by the public sector,\" Smith says. While praising much of the ES's work in the new deal, he claims it is often bound by red tape, cumbersome contractor agreements and pressure to implement national strategies rigidly. He would like to see ministers shifting more resources to the new, flexible alternatives. </p> <p>Dave Simmonds, director of the Centre for Social Inclusion think tank, agrees that civil servants can often be more productive outside the constraints of the public sector. \"The ES is trying to modernise, but has had a reputation as a top-down organisation where it's hard for people on the ground to be flexible. Civil servants I've dealt with have often felt liberated by working in partnerships with the private or voluntary sector and like the added flexibility at local level.\" </p> <p>The main tool of Working Links is the \"personal job account\"(PJA), which can total \u00a31,200 over six months and can be used to buy training, tools, clothes or other services or items needed in getting work. </p> <p>A 58-year-old Brent man, who wanted to work as a delivery driver, was given financial help to tax, MOT and insure his van. Working Links also opened a bank account for him.

This means there is an incentive to provide \"aftercare\" support to those individuals settling back into employment. </p> <p>So strong is this incentive, in fact, that one Working Links adviser has even been to jobseekers' homes in the first weeks of a new job to ensure they get to work on time. \"Many employment schemes have found that the first two weeks of work are the most difficult for jobseekers, which is why we're on hand to provide support,\" says Smith. \"And, of course, it's in our financial interests.\"</p>",

A pig heart transplant might save her life, but may harbour potentially deadly viruses that could spell the end of civilisation. What to do? </p> <p>This quandary concerns xenotransplantation. From the Greek, xeno means foreign or strange. Today, we use the word to mean the transplantation of cells, tissues and organs from one species to another. The current situation society now faces focuses mainly on organs from pigs meant for humans and it has recently made headlines. </p> <p>Understandably, neither patients nor their families can really make life or death decisions based on public good rather than emotional or personal wellbeing. This inability is one of the forces pushing the xeno- transplant issue on to health agencies' priority agendas the world over. If those whose lives depend on the need for transplants can't make unbiased decisions, public agencies must. </p> <p>To mass produce pigs for their organs, pigs must be cloned. Last month's issues of the journals Science and Nature had reports on the first pigs to be cloned. However, the journals also reported new details about the risks of placing pig organs into humans. The editor of Nature made a compelling case for a moratorium on clinical trials of xenotransplants because of the risks, which are myriad. Although humans and other animals share many bacteria and viruses, the impact of these microorganisms is not necessarily the same in different species. A viral example, herpes B, won't kill monkeys but it will kill humans. Aids kills humans, but not chimpanzees. </p> <p>Viruses are small and adaptable. While some viruses have little or no effect, others deplete systems and bring on disease. Some kill. They can lie dormant for years, like HIV, then suddenly become deadly. All viruses mutate, many times a year. They figure out how best to thrive, adapt and move on. Again, just as visible species adapt to Earth by natural selection and evolution, so too do the microorganisms living in our bodies. </p> <p>Some of the early success from developing pigs as donors centred on eliminating viruses from the pig - so-called \"pigs without virus\". </p> <p>But the question was never asked: which viruses? One of the thousands we already know about or one of the thousands of others we have not yet discovered or experienced? Presumably, pig organs could be screened for known viruses, as blood now is for HIV. However, as many have pointed out, you can't screen for disease agents that you don't know about. Pigs may contain viruses in their cells that have not yet been discovered and that do not affect them but may kill humans. </p> <p>Ian Wilmut, the scientist who cloned Dolly the Sheep, recently announced plans to stop experiments that would have eventually led to producing pigs for organ transplants. He cited concerns that these pigs could harbour viruses that could be passed from the pigs to people. </p> <p>Wilmut was quoted as saying: \"I think the concern is mainly unknown viruses. That's the frightening thing. If you know what the disease is, you know how to look for it. It's possible there could be viruses we don't know about that could be released into the human population.\" </p> <p>Recently, scientists found out that some viruses \"turn on\" other viruses. Interestingly, they found these \"pro-viruses\" in pigs. </p> <p>Pigs also contain porcine endogenous retroviruses (Pervs) and these viruses can infect human cells. All pigs contain several copies of Pervs. Viruses related to PERV are associated with cancers of the blood. And how will these viruses that jump the species barrier mutate? </p> <p>We already know that viruses have jumped the species barrier as a result of xenotransplants. Patients who underwent \"splenic perfusions\" in Russia tested positive for Perv DNA. In the US, a man who received a baboon liver in an experimental transplant became infected with baboon-specific CMV virus. </p> <p>All viruses mutate. Will the pig viruses mutate so they can be spread like the common cold yet have the symptoms and mortality of Ebola, Aids or the Marburg virus? This is not science fiction or a Stephen King novel. This is very real and very possible. </p> <p>We cannot screen for viruses we don't know exist, we can't eliminate the proviruses, we can't guarantee pig organs without Pervs and we can't rely on the physicians, scientists and vested interest groups to act responsibly. So what is driving this insanity? </p> <p>According to the investment firm, Salomon Brothers, the xenotransplant market could exceed $6bn per year. Others consider that to be a conservative estimate. Nature magazine recently stated: \"The momentum towards clinical trials of xenotransplantation is seemingly unstoppable, powered as it is by multi- million dollar investment by bio- technology companies.\" </p> <p>The vested interest groups who hype xenotransplantation portray it as making life-saving organs available to people. They shrug off the threat to the human population from species-jumping infectious agents that could trigger worldwide epidemics. And they have influence over government agencies. </p> <p>Dr Jonathan Allan, a virologist at the Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research, Texas, was quoted in a Nature Medicine article as saying: \"I'm not optimistic that they (public health service agencies) will do the right thing and put public health first.\" </p> <p>As long ago as January 1998 Dr Fritz Bach, a leading xenotransplant scientist from Harvard medical school, Boston, asked: \"Is the risk to the public - which we can't quantify but we know is greater than zero - justified by the help we are going to give individuals?\" </p> <p>Bach and Dr Harvey Fineberg, Harvard University provost and former dean of Harvard's public health department, led a nine- member group calling for a temporary halt to animal-to-human transplants before the pressures to do such experiments become \"well-nigh irresistible\". </p> <p>Fortunately, we have promising alternatives to such transplants. They include stem cells, organ donation card education programmes, opt-out programmes, organ donor coordinators at hospitals, expanding the organ donor bases by allowing the donations of organs from older individuals, the use of artificial organs, and well-proven preventive approaches such as not smoking or drinking alcohol, exercising regularly and eating a proper diet.The preventable deaths of children and adults due to a lack of organs are tragic. But it only takes one transplant to start an epidemic, and the risk to society as a whole cannot be over- estimated. The only way to prevent an infectious agent being passed into a human from a xenotransplant is not to perform the operation. There is simply too much risk to do otherwise.</p> <p>\u0095 Ray Greek is president of Americans For Medical Advancement and Europeans For Medical Advancement (tel 020-7722 8934; website: <a href=\"http://www.curedisease.com\">www.curedisease.com</a>. </p> <p>He is co-author, with Jean Swingle Greek,of Sacred Cows and Golden Geese: The Human Cost of Experiments on AnimalsEuropeans For Medical Advancement</p>",

He cited concerns that these pigs could harbour viruses that could be passed from the pigs to people. Wilmut was quoted as saying: \"I think the concern is mainly unknown viruses. That's the frightening thing. If you know what the disease is, you know how to look for it. It's possible there could be viruses we don't know about that could be released into the human population.\" Recently, scientists found out that some viruses \"turn on\" other viruses. Interestingly, they found these \"pro-viruses\" in pigs. Pigs also contain porcine endogenous retroviruses (Pervs) and these viruses can infect human cells. All pigs contain several copies of Pervs. Viruses related to PERV are associated with cancers of the blood. And how will these viruses that jump the species barrier mutate? We already know that viruses have jumped the species barrier as a result of xenotransplants. Patients who underwent \"splenic perfusions\" in Russia tested positive for Perv DNA. In the US, a man who received a baboon liver in an experimental transplant became infected with baboon-specific CMV virus. All viruses mutate. Will the pig viruses mutate so they can be spread like the common cold yet have the symptoms and mortality of Ebola, Aids or the Marburg virus? This is not science fiction or a Stephen King novel. This is very real and very possible. We cannot screen for viruses we don't know exist, we can't eliminate the proviruses, we can't guarantee pig organs without Pervs and we can't rely on the physicians, scientists and vested interest groups to act responsibly. So what is driving this insanity? According to the investment firm, Salomon Brothers, the xenotransplant market could exceed $6bn per year. Others consider that to be a conservative estimate. Nature magazine recently stated: \"The momentum towards clinical trials of xenotransplantation is seemingly unstoppable, powered as it is by multi- million dollar investment by bio- technology companies.\" The vested interest groups who hype xenotransplantation portray it as making life-saving organs available to people. They shrug off the threat to the human population from species-jumping infectious agents that could trigger worldwide epidemics. And they have influence over government agencies. Dr Jonathan Allan, a virologist at the Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research, Texas, was quoted in a Nature Medicine article as saying: \"I'm not optimistic that they (public health service agencies) will do the right thing and put public health first.\" As long ago as January 1998 Dr Fritz Bach, a leading xenotransplant scientist from Harvard medical school, Boston, asked: \"Is the risk to the public - which we can't quantify but we know is greater than zero - justified by the help we are going to give individuals?\" Bach and Dr Harvey Fineberg, Harvard University provost and former dean of Harvard's public health department, led a nine- member group calling for a temporary halt to animal-to-human transplants before the pressures to do such experiments become \"well-nigh irresistible\". Fortunately, we have promising alternatives to such transplants. They include stem cells, organ donation card education programmes, opt-out programmes, organ donor coordinators at hospitals, expanding the organ donor bases by allowing the donations of organs from older individuals, the use of artificial organs, and well-proven preventive approaches such as not smoking or drinking alcohol, exercising regularly and eating a proper diet.The preventable deaths of children and adults due to a lack of organs are tragic. But it only takes one transplant to start an epidemic, and the risk to society as a whole cannot be over- estimated. The only way to prevent an infectious agent being passed into a human from a xenotransplant is not to perform the operation. There is simply too much risk to do otherwise. \u0095 Ray Greek is president of Americans For Medical Advancement and Europeans For Medical Advancement (tel 020-7722 8934; website: www.curedisease.com.

Formerly, social work students were disadvantaged by length of training. In future, they will be disadvantaged financially. </p> <p>During the good years for university education, when students did not have to pay tuition fees and received grants, social work alone among the professions was limited to two years. The extension to three years has only been granted now when many working-class, mature students can no longer afford to go to university. Three years' accumulation of debt is even more daunting than two. </p> <p>Nursing students do not have to pay tuition fees and may get some support. Social work students deserve and need to be treated equally. </p> <p>My own observation of students on access courses indicates that some are choosing nursing simply because of affordability. I do not think it is in the long term interest of the nursing profession to have so many recruits who, in a situation of equal opportunities, would have chosen differently. </p> <p>The loss to social work will not necessarily be a gain to nursing. <br> <strong> Gwyn Gwyntopher, London</strong> </p> <p><strong> Caring con trick</strong></p> <p> In simple language, Barbara Hutton described in a nutshell the reality of life in Britain now not only for the elderly, but also for those who are disabled or chronically sick (Letters, August 23). </p> <p>My own experience in north Yorkshire tallies with hers - acute need is all too often met with bureaucratic impassivity (\"that is not covered by the regulations\") unless you are able to pay. </p> <p>Community care is a con trick inflicted on us by one unscrupulous government and, to their shame, perpetuated by the present lot. I thank Barbara for at least having the spirit to try to alert the rest of us. Things will not change unless we all make an effort to force improvements. <br> <strong> Raye Whitten, Skipton</strong> </p> <p> \u0095 Barbara Hutton asks if people realise what community care amounts to. The answer is no. </p> <p>My son, totally physically disabled by cerebral palsy, lives independently in London with the help of \"carers\". He is transferred from bed to wheelchair and from wheelchair to toilet with the aid of slings - and he hasn't had a bath for years. This might be helpful to carers, but I can assure readers that it increases disabilities. Cleaning appears to be of little importance. </p> <p>I am 83 and I know that, like the disabled, others decide what is good for us oldies - and dish it out accordingly, often wasting money on unsuitable and unused aids. <br> <strong> Hilda Davies, Birkenhead</strong> </p> <p><strong> Without region</strong><br> </p> <p> \"Britain's big provincial cities are on the march\" it says here (Seven up for it, September 13).

Sir Robin Wales, chair, Association of London Government Priced out of social work The extension of social work training to three years is welcome news and long overdue (Steep learning curves, August 30). Sadly, however, there is still a serious issue of unequal opportunities. Formerly, social work students were disadvantaged by length of training. In future, they will be disadvantaged financially. During the good years for university education, when students did not have to pay tuition fees and received grants, social work alone among the professions was limited to two years. The extension to three years has only been granted now when many working-class, mature students can no longer afford to go to university. Three years' accumulation of debt is even more daunting than two. Nursing students do not have to pay tuition fees and may get some support. Social work students deserve and need to be treated equally. My own observation of students on access courses indicates that some are choosing nursing simply because of affordability. I do not think it is in the long term interest of the nursing profession to have so many recruits who, in a situation of equal opportunities, would have chosen differently. The loss to social work will not necessarily be a gain to nursing. Gwyn Gwyntopher, London Caring con trick In simple language, Barbara Hutton described in a nutshell the reality of life in Britain now not only for the elderly, but also for those who are disabled or chronically sick (Letters, August 23). My own experience in north Yorkshire tallies with hers - acute need is all too often met with bureaucratic impassivity (\"that is not covered by the regulations\") unless you are able to pay. Community care is a con trick inflicted on us by one unscrupulous government and, to their shame, perpetuated by the present lot. I thank Barbara for at least having the spirit to try to alert the rest of us. Things will not change unless we all make an effort to force improvements. Raye Whitten, Skipton \u0095 Barbara Hutton asks if people realise what community care amounts to. The answer is no. My son, totally physically disabled by cerebral palsy, lives independently in London with the help of \"carers\". He is transferred from bed to wheelchair and from wheelchair to toilet with the aid of slings - and he hasn't had a bath for years. This might be helpful to carers, but I can assure readers that it increases disabilities. Cleaning appears to be of little importance. I am 83 and I know that, like the disabled, others decide what is good for us oldies - and dish it out accordingly, often wasting money on unsuitable and unused aids. Hilda Davies, Birkenhead Without region \"Britain's big provincial cities are on the march\" it says here (Seven up for it, September 13). Look in vain in the article for Glasgow and Cardiff. Look further, and it seems the writer means \"England's\". If this is what we can expect from \"the Guardian's regional affairs correspondent\" it shows there's still a long way to go.

      "body": "<p>When coal-mining ended at Ollerton, Nottinghamshire, in 1994, 700 men lost their jobs; now about 300 women will join the dole queue with the closure before Christmas of the town's biggest remaining factory. </p> <p>Other communities would be flattened by such setbacks, but in this east Midlands town they have turned the tables and flattened the colliery site. They plan to use it as an energy-efficient, environmentally-sustainable village. Coal will be a taboo word. </p> <p>It's a bold bid for economic survival in a town of 11,000 with an unemployment rate of just over 5%. The first stage - reclaiming the land, at a cost of \u00a34m - is almost finished, but the earthmovers are silent at the moment, waiting for the last 12 families of sandpipers, a protected species, to quit their nests in a sandbank. </p> <p>But on a ridge overlooking the vast Nottinghamshire site, there is a visual display of plans so that locals can get an idea of how the 90 derelict acres will be zoned for eco-friendly housing, hi-tech industry and leisure. There will be an exhibition centre and a large park. </p> <p>The view is long term. Though the first batch of houses, probably to be self-built, will be up within a year or so, it will be anything from five to 10 years before Sherwood Energy Village, as it is already known, is complete and functioning with 400 or more jobs. And to signal the new era of energy generation, there will be a biomass power station. </p> <p>In the short term, Ollerton is concerned with the effect of closure of the Coats Viyella factory. It is one of four to go in the region as the company ends its long links as a clothing supplier to Marks &amp; Spencer. Whole families depend on the plant - all five of Sandy Houston's sisters, for instance. \"Two full-time, one part-time, two outworkers,\" he says. \"My mum's worked there for years, too. They've no idea what they'll do.\" Sandy was at Coats until last month when he quit to become a driver with a relative's taxi firm. He can hardly believe his luck in getting out. </p> <p>Quite a few women at Coats are sole breadwinners, wives of former miners, says Dennis Walker, leader of the town council. For months, there were rumours that M&amp;S's troubles would hit Ollerton, though that did not lessen the shock when the announcement came. </p> <p>The disappearance of Coats marks the end of an enduring industrial marriage of a type contracted in many coalfields over 50 years ago. Hosiery and knitwear manufacture was started specifically to give work to wives and daughters of pitmen and to provide a second income. </p> <p>Now, two generations on, Ollerton is on the cusp of change, though some older residents can hardly believe in the coming hi-tech era. They are still in mourning for mining, in the lunchtime emptiness in the vast miners' \"welfare\", where once top comedians and Tamla Motown groups used to come. Memories of the 1984-85 miners' strike - in which a man died on the Ollerton picket line - linger in endless streets of homes with uniform net curtains at the windows and concessionary coal in the fireplace. </p> <p>To glimpse the future, step into the office of Carla Jamison, manager of the energy village. It is emphatically not the case that the community has turned its back on coal, she says. On the contrary, \"coal was taken away from us\". </p> <p>What happened, she says, is that a public meeting to air concerns about the pit's future was scheduled for the very night, in March 1994, that its closure was officially announced. So the discussion changed from \"What if...?\" to \"What now?\" The community held strongly that the area should not be allowed to decline, with production ending at four of five local mines. \"People wanted to build a sustainable future,\" Jamison says. \"They said we've got to fight to replace the jobs lost and create a diverse economic base.\" They were adamant on one other point: \"No more muck.\" Muck had become a dirty word. Recently, local groups have pitched in with specific ideas for their presence in the energy village: the scouts would like to erect a solar-design hut; the women's centre wants to self-build a meeting place. </p> <p>Given that Ollerton miners were known for their moderation in industrial relations (though support for the breakaway Union of Democratic Mineworkers caused clashes), the plan they supported for using the land once the pit closed was startlingly radical. By 1996, they had acquired the site from the coal board for \u00a350,000 - the money borrowed from the board itself - and opted for a structure to transform it that would, while bringing in outside investors, ensure control remained in local hands. </p> <p>An industrial and provident society was set up, with all participants having just one vote, whether they held a single share or many thousands. Grants of \u00a34m enabled reclamation work to begin last January. Recycling as much as possible of the industrial debris was a key goal. </p> <p>In keeping with the masterplan, which has been drawn up on strict principles of sustainability, there must be no carbon dioxide emissions by the industrial companies that eventually come, and householders will use solar heating. In environmental terms, says Jamison, \"there'll be nothing else like it\". </p> <p>A big breakthrough will be when the first of the hoped-for sunrise firms makes a solid commitment to move in. But there have been a few setbacks. It was hoped to convert one of the grassed-over tips, which ring much of the site, into a ski run. That has been abandoned. </p> <p>Also, the most promising source of employment was a major supermarket not on the site itself, but next to it. Originally, it was to have opened about now, which would have been ideal for absorbing many of the Coats' staff. However, Walker says there have been delays with the company handling the deal. \"I understand plans have been set back till 2001,\" he says. \"I'm very disappointed with that.\" </p> <p>But he is stoical. Dramatic change comes to communities that once passed as staid, but it happens slowly. Often its preceded by rumour - as with the death of the pit and the knitwear factory. By the same token, positive events unfold gradually. </p> <p>Perhaps that is the pace that feels comfortable to communities relying on a narrow economic base. Because, for all the careful planning by the energy village team, and for all its excellent educational and missionary work about a clean future, there are still old wounds, dating from the miners' strike. </p> <p>The dispute was 15 years ago, but still seems a short time ago to some. Walker was NUM branch president for part of the strike. \"There was strong feeling,\" he recalls. \"Brother against brother, father against son. There's still a little bit of feeling about that.\" </p> <p>Walker is 70 and has been involved in the town for 35 years. He is all for the energy village, the new supermarket, a new business park. But he knows also that the days when Ollerton supplied men to work in four other nearby pits are over. Only one, Thoresby, is still operating. </p> <p>He remembers, too, that he was made redundant when the strike was over. \"We've been let down before,\" he says, \"so we're taking it all quietly.\"</p> <p> <strong>Pits and the pendulum</strong></p> <p> Almost 36,000 jobs were lost in the Nottinghamshire coalfield between 1980 and 1997 as the industry collapsed. Today, there are just four pits left: Clipstone, Harworth, Thoresby and Welbeck, which together employ some 1,900 workers. </p> <p>On top of the direct job losses, many thousands more would have gone in industries supplying and servicing the pits. And thousands more again would have gone previously, as the pit workforces systematically shrank ahead of closure. In 1974, the Ollerton mine employed 1,355 - almost twice as many as were working there at the end. </p> <p>Despite this dramatic slump in the deep-mined coal sector, Nottinghamshire recorded a net gain of 14,500 jobs in the period 1993-97. But there has been an imbalance across the county in jobs lost and jobs created. </p> <p>While new, mainly service sector employers have been attracted to the south of the county - particularly around Nottingham itself - the north has not benefited to anything like the same degree. Former mining communities have generally fared worst, with Ollerton suffering a net loss of 500 jobs in 1993-97. </p> <p>The government says it is devoting more than \u00a31bn a year to regeneration of local authority areas with coalfields. But critics point out that this extends beyond ex-mining areas and also includes money for housing and welfare-to-work schemes. </p> <p>David Brindle</p>",

That, at least, was the theme of a recent conference marking 21 years of British awareness of the Hungarian approach to dealing with such disability. But the man deemed responsible for bringing those methods to Britain is evidently feeling his age. </p> <p>At 60, Andrew Sutton seems a little world-weary. \"If I were 20 years younger, I would have been off to America,\" he says. \"Why should I stay here to be starved and insulted? I could go across the Atlantic and get the necessary resources and intellectual interest.\" </p> <p>Two decades of battling against conservatism, parsimony, suspicion and what he calls the \"disdainful disinterest\" of established practitioners and other charities have taken their toll. As recently as July, schools inspectorate Ofsted claimed his National Institute for Conductive Education was too reliant on overseas staff. Sutton's response was to point to the institute's first seven British graduates in conductive education (CE), who received their degrees last Friday. \"At last we have the basis of a profession and an academic discipline,\" he says. </p> <p>What has kept him going has been the knowledge that there are many people in Britain desperate to find better ways of dealing with the motor disorders which nature or accident has visited on them or their children. People like the Baston family, who live a few miles across Birmingham from the institute. </p> <p>Esther Baston, 16, is one of CE's success stories. \"Success\", of course, is a relative term: CE offers no miracle cures. But the fact that Esther will take her GCSEs next year at a mainstream school, only one year behind her able-bodied contemporaries, is a triumph. For herself. For her parents, Kathy and Brian. For her teachers. And for conductors, here and in Hungary - orchestrators of the group dynamics through which disabled people encourage each other and acquire the means to overcome seemingly insurmountable odds. </p> <p>Esther was born with cerebral palsy and might have spent a lifetime with no control over her limbs or bodily functions. Even today she cannot speak or walk. But her eyes shine with intelligence. She can sit up, write on a laptop computer and communicate with the help of a device called a Dyna Vox; with concentrated determination, she prods in what she wants to say, until a disembodied voice speaks up on her behalf. </p> <p>Through the device, she tells which subjects she is studying and how she likes Liverpool and England footballer Michael Owen. She even manages to feed in a disparaging remark about her father's team, Coventry City. \"Thank goodness for modern computer technology,\" says her mother. Thank goodness, too, that she had the courage, when Esther was three, to take her behind what was still the iron curtain, to seek help at the institute founded in Budapest by Andras Peto. </p> <p>While Esther's father looked after her three elder brothers, she and her mother set off with six months' worth of disposable nappies (the need for which was dispensed with after a few weeks) and nine other families from the West Midlands. </p> <p>All had been avid watchers of the previous year's television documentary, Standing Up for Joe, about a London family which had been to Hungary seeking help for a disabled child. The BBC had found itself inundated with 11,000 letters. \"Then they all wrote to me,\" says Sutton, beaming now through the thatch of his greying beard. </p> <p>By the end of that year, 1986, Sutton had set up the Foundation for Conductive Education. Since 1979, he had been a fairly regular visitor to Budapest, having been alerted to what was going on there by one of his postgraduate students at Birmingham University. Sutton was a psychologist and a specialist in Soviet special education. \"They were two generations ahead of us in those days,\" he says. </p> <p>By 1984, the local education authority in Birmingham was paying him to look into the possibilities and the financial implications of bringing CE to the UK. At the same time, the Thatcher government was taking a keen interest in Central Europe and Hungary in particular - or, as Sutton puts it \"showing them which way their bread was buttered.\" </p> <p>That same year, a junior Foreign Office minister called Kenneth Clarke arrived in Budapest and was persuaded by the British ambassador's wife to fit the Peto Institute into his schedule. By all accounts, Clarke came home impressed by what he had seen. Even better, he soon became secretary of state for health. There should have been a well-placed champion for CE in government. But there wasn't, much to Sutton's disappointment. \"It would have been helpful to have him on our side,\" he muses, \"but you can't rewrite history.\" </p> <p>Nevertheless, disability charity Scope now employs Hungarians from the Peto Institute at its headquarters in London and has set up its own degree course to train British conductors. \"They did a u-turn at the end of the 80s and began to embrace conductive education,\" Sutton concedes. \"But theirs has been a separate development from us.\" </p> <p>Indeed, there are now some 30 centres employing conductors in Britain and twice as many in the US. In Norway, Sutton says, the government is considering an enthusiastic report suggesting that CE be offered free to children who need it. </p> <p>There is not much chance of that happening here, Sutton believes. \"Special education is not a high political priority and rehabilitative care for people with chronic conditions is not what the NHS does. The British way is for the voluntary sector to start things before the state takes it up, reluctantly, and runs it in a non-universal way. Still, at least it's gradually coming home to folk here that conductive education is increasingly accepted abroad, that it's not just a quaint notion from a funny little country from behind the iron curtain.\" </p> <p><strong>The little boy who learned to blossom</strong></p> <p> Ros and Chas McGuigan, from Coventry, sought help at the Peto Institute in Budapest 14 years ago when their son, Matthew, was four. </p> <p>Chas, who is now assistant director at the national institute, recalls: \"Matthew was a miserable, disabled little bundle and they got him to open up and blossom like a flower.

The new report, published last week by the NHS centre for reviews and dissemination at York University, suggests that while this is moderately good at keeping patients in contact with services, its advantage over other systems is slight. It prevents only one in 10 people with schizophrenia being lost to the system when they would otherwise have gone astray. </p> <p>At the same time, the report says, the approach raises hospital admission rates by 60% - and almost doubles them in British studies - and increases time spent in hospital by more than 50%, with no benefit to patients' mental health.

According to Clive Adams, one of the report's authors, it may be \"paranoid practice on the paranoid\". </p> <p>The report, Psychosocial Interventions for Schizophrenia, weighs up the available evidence worldwide on different approaches to managing mental disorder. Adams, co-ordinating editor of the Cochrane schizophrenia group, says that when the CPA was introduced into Britain in 1991, it was already clear from US studies that it led to more admissions. \"It does do what the original government intended it to do: it just about prevents people from getting lost -but at a price.\" </p> <p>In contrast, the report finds that \"assertive\" community treatment (ACT), also developed in the US, not only maintains contact with more patients compared to other systems, but also cuts hospital admissions by about 40% and reduces time spent in hospital by almost 50% without any clinical harm. The British government has promised a big expansion of assertive outreach teams - which help even hard-to-engage patients to keep up with care - but the York authors are doubtful this amounts to the same thing as the rigorous American ACT system. </p> <p>Leading mental health agencies have reacted with scepticism to the York conclusions. \"It is a nonsensical academic interpretation of the facts,\" says Matt Muijen, director of the Sainsbury centre. Ensuring someone is responsible for co-ordinating each patient's care through the CPA makes \"good sense\". If staff are over-cautious about admissions, he maintains that is not the fault of the system. </p> <p>Cliff Prior, chief executive of the National Schizophrenia Fellowship, agrees. Some admissions to hospital might be \"defensive\" practice, he says, but the basic principle of drawing up a care package for every patient is essential. </p> <p>Implementation of measures in the NHS plan should reduce hospital admissions. It aims to have assertive outreach in place by 2003 for all 20,000 people estimated to need it, as well as \"crisis resolution\" teams 12 months later to treat 100,000 people a year who would otherwise be admitted to hospital. The plan forecasts that \"pressure on acute in-patient units will be reduced by 30%\". </p> <p>This will, however, depend on an end to current uncertainty over the future organisation of mental health care. On top of existing moves to create large, specialist mental health trusts, the plan foreshadows emergence of combined mental health and social care trusts, the better to integrate services, as well as commissioning and provision of mental health care by the primary care trusts (PCTs) which all current primary care groups (PCGs) are due to become by 2004. </p> <p>All the signs are that government failed to think this through before the plan was published in July.

The live music stage and movie marquee were powered by wind turbines and photovoltaic panels. The only concession to conventional fuel was the bottled gas used by some of the caterers. </p> <p>Savage says: \"Ten years ago we would not have been able to do this, not because people were not interested but because the means did not exist.\" </p> <p>The festival marked Leicester's 10th anniversary as an Environment City, an award by the Royal Society for Nature Conservation in recognition of the city's commitment to sustainable development and as a challenge to further action. </p> <p>Has Leicester risen to this challenge or is it \"all hype and very little action\" as local Friends of the Earth member Roger Jones believes? </p> <p>One flagship scheme is the bike park with city centre parking, showers, repair facility and shop. More than 300 cyclists a week use the park, run by businessman Alex Webster with the support of the city council and Environ. </p> <p>The EcoHouse, Environ's environmental show home, has re-opened this year after a major re-fit at a time when many similar facilities are opening for the first time. And the council has tightened its own operations, registering with the EU's eco-management and audit scheme. </p> <p>Alistair Reid, of the environment and development department, said: \"Four or five other local authorities are on the Emas register but we are the biggest to apply it to the whole council system.\" </p> <p>This has led to significant savings in paper and water use. The council's energy consumption has dropped too - by 8.4% in 10 years. Ross Willmott, leader of the Labour-run council, said: \"We have achieved quite a lot from locating sources of air pollution to the council's use of renewable energy in its own buildings.\" </p> <p>A survey by Environ this year found that twice as many local residents considered Environment City status a benefit compared with those who considered it a PR exercise. </p> <p>But Jones is not alone in his analysis. The council conducts public opinion surveys but Nick Jukes, an independent green activist, is still angry at its rejection of a plan by residents to convert disused allotments into community gardens. </p> <p>As for transport, the city has one park-and-ride scheme and the council hopes to get government approval for four more. Real-time information bulletins on three bus routes in the area are also being provided. </p> <p>A key indicator is recycling. The authority operates a comprehensive kerbside recycling collection although its recycling rate is a mid-table 10.5%.

      "bodyText": "The tantalising smell of chips lingered in the air at a summer fair in Leicester but the odour could be traced to two generators, not the food stands. \"They're running on recycled chip shop oil from Wales,\" says Oliver Savage from the organisers, Environ, a local eco-charity. It was his idea to hold a festival run as much as possible on renewable energy. The live music stage and movie marquee were powered by wind turbines and photovoltaic panels. The only concession to conventional fuel was the bottled gas used by some of the caterers. Savage says: \"Ten years ago we would not have been able to do this, not because people were not interested but because the means did not exist.\" The festival marked Leicester's 10th anniversary as an Environment City, an award by the Royal Society for Nature Conservation in recognition of the city's commitment to sustainable development and as a challenge to further action. Has Leicester risen to this challenge or is it \"all hype and very little action\" as local Friends of the Earth member Roger Jones believes? One flagship scheme is the bike park with city centre parking, showers, repair facility and shop. More than 300 cyclists a week use the park, run by businessman Alex Webster with the support of the city council and Environ. The EcoHouse, Environ's environmental show home, has re-opened this year after a major re-fit at a time when many similar facilities are opening for the first time. And the council has tightened its own operations, registering with the EU's eco-management and audit scheme. Alistair Reid, of the environment and development department, said: \"Four or five other local authorities are on the Emas register but we are the biggest to apply it to the whole council system.\" This has led to significant savings in paper and water use. The council's energy consumption has dropped too - by 8.4% in 10 years. Ross Willmott, leader of the Labour-run council, said: \"We have achieved quite a lot from locating sources of air pollution to the council's use of renewable energy in its own buildings.\" A survey by Environ this year found that twice as many local residents considered Environment City status a benefit compared with those who considered it a PR exercise. But Jones is not alone in his analysis. The council conducts public opinion surveys but Nick Jukes, an independent green activist, is still angry at its rejection of a plan by residents to convert disused allotments into community gardens. As for transport, the city has one park-and-ride scheme and the council hopes to get government approval for four more. Real-time information bulletins on three bus routes in the area are also being provided. A key indicator is recycling. The authority operates a comprehensive kerbside recycling collection although its recycling rate is a mid-table 10.5%. It hopes to quadruple this, though, through a \u00a325.8m compost machine. But Jones said: \"The weaknesses lie in the city council's efforts. They start out with good ideas but when the novelty wears off, they move on to something else. We were going to be a showcase for others to learn from but we have been overtaken by others doing better things.\" He criticises the city council for its work on litter, tree-planting and park maintenance. Andy Brooks, of Leicestershire Transport 2000, said: \"Environment City caught people's imagination but in the past two to three years the impetus has been flagging.\" He is optimistic that statutory public consultation will highlight the people's concerns - and money will follow. But the attitude that \"the council should do more\" angers Savage. \"People think Environment City is about the council when it's about personal responsibility.\"",

Opt-out is when users have to untick a box asking to avoid being sent marketing messages from third parties (usually when filling in a form on a website), while opt-in is when they choose to tick the box and receive more targeted emails. \"The trouble with opt-out is that it gives online marketers the green light to send as many email campaigns as they like - which is 100% spam,\" continued Marson. \"The internet industry believes that opt-in is the only responsible approach but it seems the government hasn't listened to this.\" Other critics of spam says the government's decision demonstrates its lack of understanding about the internet and that it should have taken into account the views of the ISP community rather than those of the DMA. According to a poll of 180 UK ISPs conducted by Mailtrack, some 98% said they strongly favoured an opt-in policy Richard Clayton, chair of the London Internet Exchange (LINX) subcommittee combating spam, said: \"ISPs are not in the least bit happy about delivering unsolicited email to customers. Besides clogging up our mail systems, the customers never wanted it in the first place and we then have to handle their complaints. We're totally in favour of opt-in and we take firm action to ensure that spammers do not use our systems to send their junk.\"",

He said: \"Greenpeace wanted to remove the GM maize in Norfolk because we believe that GM crops will inevitably contaminate the environment. \"The government is currently reviewing separation distances imposed between GM crops and other similar crops - separation distances which we said were completely inadequate when we took action in July 1999.\" The charge arose out of a Greenpeace orchestrated attack on a field of genetically-modified maize at Lyng, Norfolk, in August last year. The 28 defendants admitted destroying the crop, but said that acting to prevent pollen from the genetically-modified maize from polluting neighbouring organic crops and gardens - a defence the jury sympathised with. Judge David Mellor ruled that the \u00a3250,000 costs for the two trials would fall to the prosecution. Peter Tidey, chief Crown prosecutor for Norfolk, said after the verdict: \"We felt this was a matter which should be decided by a jury and we sought a retrial so it could be resolved. There has now been a hearing and a verdict by a jury and we accept the decision of the court.\" The jury of seven men and five women took around five hours to reach its verdicts.

There were too many defendants, 13 of whom work for Greenpeace, to fit into the dock. Other defendants, including Lord Melchett, were seated in various other parts of the court. Last year, the Archers Radio 4 soap opera carried a storyline which ran parallel to today's trial. One of the characters, Tommy Archer, was charged with criminal damage after an attack on a field of GM crops and successfully mounted the same defence.",

For last week's crisis was not a failure to respond to a natural disaster. Instead it came attached to a live political issue, one with a long history of toxicity for Labour: taxation. The charge which united the hauliers, farmers, rightwing newspapers and their backers in the public was a familiar one: that Labour taxes too much.

He may be tempted to work his way through the charge sheet, line by line. That would be a mistake, far too defensive. Nor should he go to the other extreme, merely delivering a speech which could have been drafted a month ago, before the week of petrol madness. If that had not happened, perhaps Blair could have done the usual: bragged about Labour's record so far, promised more of the same in the next term - with a few headline-grabbing policy initiatives on top.</p> <p>But that is not the speech Tony Blair should give: it would be too complacent, oblivious to the wholly changed context in which his words will be heard. No, the leader has to reach for something bigger and far more daring. He has to make anew the case for Labour - and the case for government itself.</p> <p>To do that, he cannot merely refer to the events of last week elliptically; he has to address them directly and early on. Of course he could pick holes in the protesters' case - blaming the profiteers of the oil companies or noting the state handouts farmers and hauliers receive via other means - but he should leave that to surrogates. His real audience has to be those voters who sided with the demonstrators, those who turned what could have been a fringe stunt into a tax- payers' revolt.</p> <p>To address them, he needs to build an argument from first principles - forcing his audience to see the big picture. He needs to say that Labour believes in the individual, but that it also believes certain things are only possible when people work together. Sometimes the right form of collective action is local, sometimes it will be voluntary associations or charities. But there are some things we all want - such as schools and hospitals and even roads - which central government is best equipped to provide. That means spending money - and raising it.</p> <p>Now, Blair can say, we can argue about how to do that, whether by this tax or another, but do it we must. The alternative is to have ever cheaper petrol - so that our cars can hurtle through a wasteland where the schools are sinks, the hospitals are broken and only the most selfish survive.</p> <p>It is this most basic language of principle which Tony Blair should speak next Tuesday - making, without apology, the fundamental case for activist government, the very business of raising money from individuals in order to spend it on the public good.

He can say that, yes, Labour had to increase certain indirect taxes - to stabilise the economy and to pump money into our starving public services. The result is that the country is richer: economically, through super-low unemployment and inflation, and as a society, with better schools and hospitals on the way.</p> <p>Of course, that would an easier case to make if Labour's extra spending was already being felt, tangibly, by parents, patients and everyone else.

To achieve this it would need to include all shades of opinion and be a broad, multi-stakeholder initiative, including civil society. Many civil society groups, including many of the undersigned, have held discussions with the Bank and among themselves about the Gateway.</p> <p>We are writing to inform you that many of the major issues we have raised have not been addressed. It seems, especially from the report \"Global Development Gateway Issues Identified During Consultations\" recently produced by the Bank's Gateway team, that you and the Bank's Board may have been misinformed about the extent and nature of civil society concerns and our disappointment in the Bank's response.</p> <p>These concerns are serious both in relation to the opportunities missed by the Gateway, and because they have the potential to confuse potential funders, people asked to be Topic Guides, site visitors, and many others. It is not the case, as hinted in the above report of the consultations, that these views are only held by opponents of the World Bank or groups based in Europe. In fact a wide range of NGOs, academics and also officials are extremely sceptical about the initiative.</p> <p>Among the key problems identified with the Bank's Gateway plans are:</p> <p>1) insufficient independence of Gateway governance. The Gateway's global and national governance structures do not adequately protect civil society interests. Whilst an independent foundation has been established, the constitution of the Board and Advisory Committee do not give grounds for confidence that the Gateway will be truly independent of the Bank, national governments and big business. Particular concerns are the role of the Bank in making appointments relating to the Global Gateway, governments' leading roles in Country Gateways and companies' ability to buy Gateway Board membership (and \"co-branding\" opportunities) with annual payments of a million dollars. Creating a nominally independent entity has thus not solved the acute accountability issues around the Gateway, issues which are very sensitive in portal development, essentially an editorial activity similar to publishing newspapers.</p> <p>2) alternative design options rejected. Very early in discussions about the Gateway a number of civil society groups suggested an alternative design approach which would use the latest spidering software to allow distributed, user-driven topic aggregation. This would overcome the difficulties of the chosen Gateway design which gives power and impossible judgements to individual editors, and empower groups across the world to post and group information according to their needs. Yet the Gateway still favours a vertical, edited approach which will cause many problems of credibility and useability.</p> <p>3) communication/consultation insufficient. Whilst there have been a number of consultation exercises, it appears that the Bank has overemphasised the production of pilot sites and fundraising rather than communicating with diverse audiences about the GDG's intentions and what might best meet their needs. Many important groups still know nothing about the Gateway and many who do have tabled questions which have not been answered.</p> <p>4) overambition and unfair competition; The Gateway, whilst based on good intentions to increase coordination of web activity, is too ambitious and cannot meet all of its goals. At the same time its huge budget (60 million dollars over three years) and marketing reach are likely to have huge opportunity costs for the many existing and planned portal ventures in this area. It is not appropriate for the heavily subsidized Gateway to compete with these (for profit and non-profit) initiatives, including in many of the \"pilot\" countries. This approach clearly contradicts normal World Bank policy advice.</p> <p>At present, because of the above concerns and others, it is unlikely that a Civil Society Committee for the Gateway will be formed soon, despite two months of discussion about it. In fact a large number of civil society groups are likely to continue with independent initiatives to improve electronic information coordination rather than join the Gateway.</p> <p>We ask you to provide full responses to the above points as soon as possible.</p> <p>Yours sincerely,</p> <p> Alex Wilks, Bretton Woods Project, UK</p>",

But just who is this man - and why is his gift creating such a stir? <b>Claire Porter</b> explains.</p> <p><b>Who is Bernie Ecclestone?</b><br> He may be a short man - 5ft 4in - but he is a rich one, and one of the biggest names in international sport. He owns Formula One Holdings, which is the biggest and most influential company in motor racing, and also has a long-running contract with the sport's governing body, the Federation Internationale de L'Automobile (FIA), to sell television rights. This, therefore, gives him a huge standing and commands him a great deal of respect from both sportsmen and businessmen the world over.

      "bodyText": "Hot on the heels of a very long week in politics for the Labour government, due to the petrol crisis, there's fresh misery with accusations that the chancellor, Gordon Brown, lied about details surrounding a donation of \u00a31m from Formula 1 boss Bernie Ecclestone. But just who is this man - and why is his gift creating such a stir? Claire Porter explains. Who is Bernie Ecclestone? He may be a short man - 5ft 4in - but he is a rich one, and one of the biggest names in international sport. He owns Formula One Holdings, which is the biggest and most influential company in motor racing, and also has a long-running contract with the sport's governing body, the Federation Internationale de L'Automobile (FIA), to sell television rights. This, therefore, gives him a huge standing and commands him a great deal of respect from both sportsmen and businessmen the world over. He has homes all over Europe and is believed to have a personal fortune of \u00a32bn, though much of the company is owned by his Croatian-born wife Slavica - a 6ft 2in former Armani model. A degree in chemical engineering from Woolwich Polytechnic in south east London set the young, entrepreneurial Ecclestone on his way to success, but it was time spent at his car and motorbike dealership in Kent that got him hooked on motor racing.

      "bodyText": "Two French television journalists who were held hostage by Muslim rebels on a southern Philippines island since July said today that they managed to escape while their captors fled from a massive assault by the Filipino military. Jean-Jacques Le Garrec, 46, and Roland Madura, 49, who were among 19 people still being held by the Abu Sayyaf group on Jolo, used the cover of darkness to slip away from the rebels while they were crossing a road. \"We hid for some minutes and, after that, we ran on the road,\" Mr Le Garrec said at a news conference at the presidential palace in Manila. \"We spent the night hiding in the jungle in case they would be looking around for us.\" He added: \"This morning at four o'clock ... the noise of the rain gave us the opportunity of moving ourselves without being heard. We walked until daytime, having the feeling that we were going towards Jolo [town] and expecting to meet the checkpoint. \"Actually, since we didn't know exactly where we were, we were going away from Jolo, but at the daytime we hid again in the jungle along the road and we waited for a jeepney or truck to pass by.\" The two men flagged down a military truck on the road. They were taken to a military camp and then airlifted to the capital Manila. The two France-2 television journalists are the first of 19 hostages to be recovered since the Philippines government launched a military campaign against Abu Sayyaf at the weekend. They had been held since July 9, when they travelled to the rebels' jungle hideout to interview hostages. Philippine officials had earlier said that the military rescued Mr Le Garrec and Mr Madura after a clash with the rebels. President Joseph Estrada's administration has been deeply embarrassed by the series of kidnappings. Both of the former hostages smiled and appeared well as they spoke at the news conference. \"It's been two and a half long months for us, but we feel very good,\" Mr Le Garrec said. \"Of course, we are very happy today and we are in a good shape as you may judge.\" Abu Sayyaf is one of several groups campaigning for a separate Muslim state in the southern Philippines. The group has kidnapped scores of people since March but most have been released, with Libya and Malaysia reportedly paying more than $15m for 19 foreigners. The rebels are currently holding an American, three Malaysians, a Filipino kidnapped from a Malaysian diving resort in April, and 12 Filipino Christian evangelists. Seven rebels have been killed and 20 captured in the five days since the military assault began, while six government troops were wounded, military officials said. Reversing earlier comments, Mr Estrada said today that he would order a halt to the assault if the other hostages were freed. \"If they will release the 17 hostages, I will immediately order a cease-fire,\" he said. His decision to attack the rebels after nearly five months of negotiations has been widely supported by Filipinos. However, France, Germany and Malaysia expressed concern that the attack would endanger the captives. Early today, a bomb exploded on a passenger ferry shortly after it arrived at Zamboanga city, near Jolo, killing at least one person and injuring six others, two critically, officials said. The military said it suspects that Muslim rebels were responsible. Profile of the Abu Sayyaf terrorist group",

      "body": "<p>Hana Ali doesn't look much like her father, but she sounds like him, rattling through stories at a speed that suggests she has never, in her 24 years, suffered one moment's equivocation. \"The first time I knew my dad was somebody was when I was four years old and we went to a restaurant and everyone gave him a standing ovation and began chanting 'Ali! Ali!' I got goosebumps. I didn't know what it was all about, but I thought, 'Wow, my daddy's great.' \" </p> <p>She is the older of two girls from Muhammad Ali's second marriage, the only one of his nine progeny to have been brought up predominantly by him. Her sister Laila, two years younger and recently embarked on a boxing career, says that Hana is \"obsessed\" with their father. Hana has just published a book entitled More Than a Hero: Muhammad Ali's Life Lessons Presented Through His Daughter's Eyes. \"I'll quit a job if I can't get time off to go visit him,\" she says. \"If my dad's here, that's where I am. My sisters are more logical. They're not going to quit their jobs. But I figure, one day he's not going to be here, so I want every moment that I can.\" </p> <p>The book is a slim volume containing those of Hana's childhood memories that highlight her father's moral character: the time she wanted to wear a white dress and expensive jewellery to school and her father told her it would make the poor kids feel bad; how he interrupted family outings to help beggars, buying them food and sometimes setting them up in hotel rooms and finding them jobs; all the times when people stole from him and he forgave them. </p> <p>Among the recollections, and by far the most affecting part of the book, are the pre-fight poems Ali taunted his opponents with: \"I injured a stone / Hospitalised a brick. / I'm so mean I make medicine sick.\" They remind you of those great 1960s photos of him gloating into the camera with beautiful mock menace. There is his buoyant retelling of the Sonny Liston fight: \"Liston disappears from view/ The crowd is getting frantic / But our radar stations have picked him up / He's somewhere over the Atlantic.\" And the most famous of Ali's poems: \"Float like a butterfly /Sting like a bee / Your hands can't hit / What your eyes can't see.\" </p> <p>Hana was too young to remember most of her father's fights. The abiding image she has of Ali the athlete is of the end of his career. \"I remember my dad training for his last two fights, which he did not win. I remember him sitting at the ringside with a robe on, with his head down. He was finally feeling that it was the end. It wasn't so much the fighting he loved, but the travelling, the attention, the proving to himself and the world that he could be the best. He loved to do things when everything was against him and it seemed impossible. It was hard to let go of.\" </p> <p>Growing up as Muhammad Ali's daughter should have been fraught with the miseries famous people commonly inflict on their children: inferiority complex, identity crisis, cycles of over-indulgence and neglect. But Hana says that he was as generous to his children as to his fans and that of all of her siblings, she was the main beneficiary of his wisdom. It would sound gushy if Ali's vast goodness was not a matter of incontrovertible fact. </p> <p>Laila was closer to their mother, Veronica, and it was Hana who followed Ali around like a puppy. When he and Veronica divorced, she was nine. \"If anything, I saw him more after that,\" she says. \"He was there almost every day and he tried to take us with him when he went away. He would send postcards which read, 'You're beautiful like your mother, I love you,' in his messy writing. </p> <p>\"He was nervous that I would forget him. When my mother got remarried he asked, 'Do you have a new daddy?' And I was like, 'Daddy, are you out of your mind? I love you more than life. No one will ever come close to replacing you.' \" </p> <p>\"We had a lot of governesses and housekeepers and stuff. But my dad always said we could interrupt him no matter who he was talking to, even the president. The door was always open. There was never a moment when we couldn't disturb him.\" </p> <p>He spoilt her, but whenever she showed signs of becoming bigheaded, his Muslim piety kicked in and he gently told her to cool it. \"I remember bragging a lot about him. I'd say, 'I can do whatever I want; my dad is Muhammad Ali.' That sort of thing. But at the same time, I was humble too, because it was instilled in me from a young age that I shouldn't flaunt things that other kids might not have. So I was always giving stuff away, as he always gave, gave, gave.\" </p> <p>Although Hana was exposed to celebrity from a young age, she knew her father's fame to be in some way different from that of his movie star friends. \"I was used to seeing people from the TV in real life. John Travolta was always over at our house. But Daddy was different. People wouldn't just ask for his autograph when they saw him in the street. They would hug him and cry. People really loved him.\" </p> <p>During the course of his boxing career, Hana only knew Ali to be angry twice. \"My dad was never a very vicious boxer. He just did what he had to do to win the fight. The only time I saw him lose control was in a fight against Floyd Patterson. Patterson would not call him Muhammad Ali; he insisted on calling him Cassius Clay. You could see my dad in the ring, yelling, 'What's my name?' boom, 'What's my name?' boom. It was about something bigger. He was in there fighting for respect. That's the only time he threw some vicious punches.\" </p> <p>\"The other time involved his fight with Joe Frazier. My father was kept from his boxing career for three years for the stand he took [against the Vietnam draft], and here was a guy who went to war and now he was the champ and my dad felt robbed. The play turned more serious and he started calling Frazier an Uncle Tom. He believed that stuff. But when he saw on a documentary about how Joe Frazier's kids were teased and came home crying from school, he cried.\" </p> <p>Of the two girls, Laila was the one who rebelled, dressing \"immodestly\", ditching Islam and taking up boxing, which Ali disapproves of as a women's sport. Hana went to a small private college in Boston and dropped out after two years because she was homesick for her father. Her intention now is to write children's books with \"a strong moral message\". She regrets not finishing college, but consoles herself with the lessons learned from her father. \"I'm not going to follow the rules of society, I'm going to follow my instincts,\" she says, although it sounds a bit pat, a generation removed. </p> <p>About her father's Parkinson's disease, she says it has slowed down his speech, but since he spoke so fast to begin with, it is not very noticeable. \"When he's relaxed and at home, he will not shut up. He's cracking jokes, playing around. He's just the same.\" </p> <p>Despite his disapproval, Ali attends his daughter Laila's fights. \"He doesn't agree with women boxing, period, but he's supportive of her. When he's watching her at ringside, you'll see all the manifestations of emotion in his face: fear, excitement, reminiscence. My dad called me on the phone recently and said, 'Hana writes books, Laila throws hooks.' Ain't that something?\" </p> <p>More Than a Hero by Hana Ali is published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton, price \u00a310.</p>",

Moussambani, 22, who only took up swimming this year and was swimming for the first time in a 50 metre Olympic size pool, just about managed to stay afloat in the men's 100 metre freestyle race, which he won in a record slow time of one minute 52.72 seconds. His two fellow competitors, Karim Bare of Nigeria and Farkhod Oripov of Tajikstan were disqualified for false starts. Moussambani's time was 30 seconds slower than Arnold Gutmann of Hungary's winning time in the first ever 100 metres freestyle final at the Athens Olympics in 1896. It was also slower than Dutchman Pieter van den Hoogen band's 200 metres freestyle win in the same Sydney Olympic pool several hours earlier in a world record time of one minute 45.35 seconds. With only the clock to race against Moussambani was roared towards the finishing line by a passionate Australian crowd. Moussambani, who usually trains in a 20 metre pool in Malabo, capital of Equatorial Guinea - the only pool of its kind in the country - was yesterday in philosophical mood about his heroics. \"Gold medal is not everything in the Olympics,\" he said in true Olympian spirit. \"I am really happy with what happened, it was all worth it. I want to come back next time for the 2004 games in Athens. This has been a very special moment for me. I will never forget it.\" Despite winning his heat, Moussambani was eliminated from the competition because of his slow time and is preparing to return home. His training includes swimming in a river near his home, which, according to reports, is sometimes visited by crocodiles. He vowed yesterday to practice harder and said he was already preparing for the 2004 games in Athens. \"I want to send hugs and kisses to the crowd because it was their cheering that kept me going,\" he said.",

The government also agreed to lift a travel ban on Mr Gusinsky and guarantee the security and liberties of several prominent Russian journalists as part of the deal. The former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev denounced the government's tactics as \"crude blackmail\" after documents were leaked indicating interference in the constitutional rights of citizens. The power struggle for control of NTV, Russia's biggest private television channel and the jewel in the crown of Mr Gusinsky's extensive media empire, turned more vicious after lengthy negotiations on a takeover of the Gusinsky assets collapsed in mudslinging. Media Most, Mr Gusinsky's holding company, and Gazprom, Russia's gas monopoly, have been negotiating Gazprom's takeover of the media empire for several months. Mr Gusinsky signed a deal in July pledging to surrender his assets for $300m (\u00a3210m) while Gazprom promised to take on $473m in Media Most debt. On Monday Mr Gusinsky reneged on the deal, declaring he was coerced \"at gunpoint\" and disclosing that he had signed an affidavit in the presence of two foreign lawyers two days before the deal was struck stating that it was invalid because it was reached under duress. Paramilitary police raided Mr Gusinsky's offices in Moscow earlier this year and the mogul was briefly jailed in June in an incident that triggered international concern about Mr Putin's attitude to media freedoms. Since then the president has repeatedly attacked the Gusinsky media and other outlets he considers disloyal. A secret appendix to the July 20 agreement to sell out to Gazprom, released yesterday by the Gusinsky team and signed by Mikhail Lesin, the media minister, detailed the terms for the proposed Gazprom takeover and the tradeoff of Mr Gusinsky's and others' rights in return for the media surrender. The confidential appendix stipulated that the criminal investigation of Mr Gusinsky was being dropped and a travel ban lifted. It added that Mr Gusinsky and \"leaders of the organisation\" - meaning the chief editors of his newspaper, magazine, radio station, and TV channel - were being granted \"security guarantees, the protection of their rights and liberties, including the guaranteed right to move freely, to choose their place of residence, and to travel freely beyond the borders of the Russian federation and to return to the Russian federation without hindrance\". Yevgeny Kiselyev, the director of NTV and a star Russian television journalist, said: \"This is documentary evidence that the state is engaged in racketeering.\" Mr Gorbachev, who is broadly supportive of Mr Putin but warned last week that media freedoms in Russia could be in jeopardy, said he was seeking a meeting with Mr Putin to try to clear up the row. \"I'm not sure whether the president knew about this [secret agreement],\" said Mr Gorbachev. \"Perhaps he didn't know... But if this is going on behind the president's back, it's even worse - you have an elected president and then you have these clans operating.\" The document was signed by Mr Lesin and Alfred Kokh, the head of Gazprom's modest media holdings who has been leading the negotiations. Media Most is heavily indebted to Gazprom and the gas monopoly maintains that it is seeking the takeover in order to resell a controlling share in the empire to unnamed foreign investors in order to recoup its money. Media Most and many analysts contend that Gazprom is acting as a proxy for the Kremlin in order to tame the influential Gusinsky media which are critical of Mr Putin. Mr Gusinsky moved to Spain after being freed from jail and has not yet returned to Russia. Gazprom yesterday declared Media Most in default on its $211m owed to the gas giant and said it would sue. The general prosecutor's office said it may open a criminal investigation into Mr Gusinsky for alleged asset-stripping and allegedly transferring company assets to Gibraltar.",

After a wave of anxiety about the underperformance of boys at school, the analysis, commissioned by the Cabinet Office and the Home Office, says that across adolescence both genders require different but equal attention from policy-makers. Inside, outside and beyond school, young men and women are under continuing pressure to conform to traditional behaviour. At school, women avoid physics and information technology and choose English, biology, history and modern languages. \"Young women find it easier to ask for help than young men, who find it harder to admit a lack of knowledge,\" the report, Young People and Gender, published yesterday, says. Boys are more likely to break the law - a gap which extends after the age of 14 - or be involved in crime, alcohol abuse and illegal drugs. Girls, who are more likely to be concerned about their body image and weight, are much more likely to start smoking. Suicide rates are higher for men and double the number of boys die at 17. Boys are less likely to visit their GP or to use other health services. Girls are more at risk of depression, eating disorders and self-harm.

This research underlines how important gender is to young people's behaviour, their relationships and their level of achievement.\" The research emerges from a review, the Trust for the Study of Adolescence, commissioned by the women's unit in the Cabinet Office and the Home Office's family policy unit. The government has appointed a minister for young people, Paul Boateng. This year, after years of outperforming boys at GCSE and most A-levels in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, girls won more A grades at A-level for the first time, provoking a spate of hand-wringing. David Blunkett, the education secretary, has promised to look at whether single-sex lessons help boys' achievement, though he is far from certain that they do. But the report warns of the dangers of ignoring under-achieving girls. \"At different times in the past decades public anxiety has focused on one or more of the genders, but it needs to be recognised that both young women and men may be vulnerable in different ways,\" it says. \"The central conclusion of this review is that it would be wrong to identify either males or females as being more in need of attention from policy-makers. Both genders have areas of their lives in which they may be at risk.\"",

More than 4,000 foreign words and phrases are included in the latest Devoto-Oli dictionary of the Italian language, renewing fears of cultural attack. Entries such as \"outing\", \"question time\", \"mobbing\", \"transgender\", \"carbon tax\", \"new economy\", \"friendly\" and \"blockbuster\" are infuriating politicians and intellectuals. A cross-party group of deputies will meet in parliament to discuss why Italian translations could not have been found. The new entries bring the number of foreign words and expressions to an unprecedented 4% of the total. Critics complain that existing Italian words were being displaced and that not enough effort was being made to coin new ones. Conversations, advertisements and manuals are routinely peppered with \"last minute\", \"call centre\", \"chat-line\", \"newsgroup\", \"grunge\", \"megastore\", \"new age\", \"piercing\", \"squatter\" and \"vintage\". The popularity of transatlantic sport and entertainment is blamed for \"fusion\", \"infotainment\" and \"unplugged\". Vittorio Sermonti, an authority on the medieval writer Dante, told La Repubblica that he objected to \"contamination\" when Italian words were dumped in the name of modernity. High street barbers that replaced parrucchiere in favour of \"hair dresser\" made him want to scream. \"I think the moment has arrived to put an end to this excess. It is really too much,\" Mr Sermonti said. Foreign words in new editions of two other dictionaries, Lo Zingarelli and De Mauro, respectively amount to 2% and 3% of the total.

      "bodyText": "A spectacular collection of 92 Botticelli drawings illustrating Dante's The Divine Comedy, assembled as a cycle for the first time in five centuries, has returned to Italy. Hailed as one of the great unknown monuments of the Italian Renaissance, the drawings went on display in Rome yesterday after being tracked down to different corners of Europe. War, greed and national rivalry dispersed the drawings, which yesterday drew gasps at their depictions of grotesque torture and torment. The Royal Academy predicted that the exhibition, which originated in Berlin earlier this year, would cause a sensation when it transfers to London next March. The Medici family commissioned Sandro Botticelli (1445-1510) in 1480 to illustrate the entire Divine Comedy, written 200 years earlier by Dante Alighieri. Drawing with a lead stylus on large sheets of parchment made from sheepskin, each representing one canto, or section, Botticelli worked night and day to produce a total of 100 drawings. He completed the designs in ink - some in red, green and blue - but many are unfinished or badly faded. Dante's poem described his epic journey from the underworld of the inferno to purgatory and paradise, guided by the poet Virgil, Lucifer or his idealised love, Beatrice. Seducers, sodomites, forgers, adulterers, corrupt politicians and the prophet Mohammed are shown writhing in agony. Horrors include being boiled in pitch, imprisoned in a flaming tomb, having one's head twisted backwards and being buried up to the neck in ice or excrement. The Florentine artist's chief patron, Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici, who also commissioned The Birth of Venus and Primavera, is thought to have kept the drawings in his library, possibly to show guests during private readings of Dante. Mystery shrouds Botticelli's failure to complete the work, and why it was broken up shortly afterwards. A faction of the Medici family is suspected of having passed the sketches to Paris after the French invaded Italy in 1494. Some surfaced in 1658 when they were bought from a Parisian bibliophile by Queen Christina of Sweden. On her death her nephew, a cardinal, passed eight to the Vatican, where they remained. Another eight were lost but 82 ended up in the hands of the Dukes of Hamilton, who kept them in Scotland and put them up for auction, bound in a volume, at Sotheby's in 1882. British art critics were incandescent when Germany's Kaiser, galvanised by his advisers, acquired them for Berlin's Kupferstichkabinett gallery before the public auction. After the second world war, the 84 drawings were split between east and west Berlin. Italian and German scholars persuaded Berlin and the Vatican to release the drawings for the current exhibition at the newly restored Papal Stables in Rome's Quirinale palace, the residence of Italy's president. It runs until December 3. Art experts have compared the effect of the drawings together to an animated film, with Botticelli's use of light and movement very different from The Birth of Venus. The artist took Dante's text literally and translated the narrative into images. Each of the hundreds of small figures has an individual face expressing torment, fear, hope or elation. Former friends of the artist are included in the damned and do not proceed beyond the fires. Those who do, encounter a river of light to paradise, where angels, the Virgin Mary and Jesus, portrayed as a sun god, await. Norman Rosenthal, the Royal Academy's exhibitions secretary, said the work was one of the greatest monuments to the Renaissance.",

      "body": "<p>Buoyed by their best opinion poll result for five years, Liberal Democrat leaders yesterday predicted they would win more seats than their current 47 at the coming general election, and could even double their numbers at the expense of Labour and the Conservatives.</p> <p>Charles Kennedy has been cautious about the advice of Lord Rennard, his polling pundit, who noted that 50 southern Tory seats have majorities smaller than the one which fell to the Lib Dems at the Romsey byelection this spring.</p> <p>But this week's Guardian/ICM opinion poll gave Mr Kennedy's troops 22% - one point more than NOP's 21% in the Sunday Times - as angry voters defected from Labour but gave William Hague only half the swing votes.</p> <p>At the party conference yesterday the mood was much more upbeat. Mr Kennedy blamed Labour's collapse on \"institutional arrogance\" while his campaigns chief, Lord Razzell, told delegates: \"Order the champagne for the day after the election. We will be celebrating winning more seats and more votes than in 1997.</p> <p>\"The evidence is there. I am not just talking about the opinion polls - no, I am talking about the hard evidence of real votes cast by real people in real elections,\" said Lord Razzell, who reminded the 50 Tory MPs vulnerable post-Romsey: \"Watch out, Liberal Democrats are after you.\"</p> <p>He promised delegates that the Lib Dem campaign - \"honest, confident, positive\" - would never compromise, as Labour had, on issues such as pensions, Europe, race, public services or the environment.</p> <p>Last night's party political broadcast showed Mr Kennedy making similar claims while warning that, though Labour had proved better for the NHS and education than the Tories, Mr Blair had \"wasted three years\" following Tory tax plans. \"You need to watch Labour like a hawk, they are forever claiming to be spending more money than they have,\" he said.</p> <p>Lib Dems analysts say they have some basis for hoping to hold their seats and make even modest gains in the coming election, because there are signs that sitting MPs benefit from first-time incumbency when defending their patch.</p> <p>If Mr Hague can get his core vote out and gain some centre ground Mr Kennedy's hopes could go pear-shaped. But Lord Razzell summed up the optimism in Bournemouth when he said: \"Labour a disappointment; Tories a disaster. So you can tell people how Liberal Democrats can make the difference.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Buoyed by their best opinion poll result for five years, Liberal Democrat leaders yesterday predicted they would win more seats than their current 47 at the coming general election, and could even double their numbers at the expense of Labour and the Conservatives. Charles Kennedy has been cautious about the advice of Lord Rennard, his polling pundit, who noted that 50 southern Tory seats have majorities smaller than the one which fell to the Lib Dems at the Romsey byelection this spring. But this week's Guardian/ICM opinion poll gave Mr Kennedy's troops 22% - one point more than NOP's 21% in the Sunday Times - as angry voters defected from Labour but gave William Hague only half the swing votes. At the party conference yesterday the mood was much more upbeat. Mr Kennedy blamed Labour's collapse on \"institutional arrogance\" while his campaigns chief, Lord Razzell, told delegates: \"Order the champagne for the day after the election. We will be celebrating winning more seats and more votes than in 1997. \"The evidence is there. I am not just talking about the opinion polls - no, I am talking about the hard evidence of real votes cast by real people in real elections,\" said Lord Razzell, who reminded the 50 Tory MPs vulnerable post-Romsey: \"Watch out, Liberal Democrats are after you.\" He promised delegates that the Lib Dem campaign - \"honest, confident, positive\" - would never compromise, as Labour had, on issues such as pensions, Europe, race, public services or the environment. Last night's party political broadcast showed Mr Kennedy making similar claims while warning that, though Labour had proved better for the NHS and education than the Tories, Mr Blair had \"wasted three years\" following Tory tax plans. \"You need to watch Labour like a hawk, they are forever claiming to be spending more money than they have,\" he said. Lib Dems analysts say they have some basis for hoping to hold their seats and make even modest gains in the coming election, because there are signs that sitting MPs benefit from first-time incumbency when defending their patch. If Mr Hague can get his core vote out and gain some centre ground Mr Kennedy's hopes could go pear-shaped. But Lord Razzell summed up the optimism in Bournemouth when he said: \"Labour a disappointment; Tories a disaster. So you can tell people how Liberal Democrats can make the difference.\"",

The announcement follows the arrest of three Serbs in the enclave of Gracanica, south of Pristina, and comes just three days ahead of Yugoslav presidential and parliamentary elections. The men were seized along with a range of weapons, timing devices and plastic explosives in an operation led by British and Swedish troops. The head of the UN mission in Kosovo, Bernard Kouchner, said two of the three men arrested were believed to be serving or former members of a Yugoslav special forces unit based in the southern Serbian town of Nis. K-For officials were unable to say what the group had been planning but Mr Kouchner described the plan as \"an obvious attempt to destabilise Kosovo\". The commander of British troops in the province, Brigadier Robert Fry, said the group had been monitored before their arrest. \"Prior to their detention I had intelligence that I found compelling evidence to link them to the VJ [Yugoslav army] and to the special forces organisation in Nis,\" he said. After being held briefly in a British military base, the group is now in custody in a UN-run prison in Pristina. Photographs of weapons at the scene of the arrest were put on display by K-For.

Brig Fry said it was clear the group was attempting to make and detonate a bomb for use in Kosovo, but in spite of the evidence found at the scene he could not speculate on the precise target. He said he believed the group had been in the province for at least several weeks and that they had been run and controlled from inside Serbia.

Those words were on the lips of outraged traditionalist art lovers yesterday as the Royal Academy opened the doors on Apocalypse, the exhibition that tries to go one step further than its last shocker, Sensation.</p> <p>With conservative Roman Catholics already protesting at a sculpture of the Pope being felled by a meteorite, a mini-storm brewing over a video showing a split second of penetrative sex, not to mention the Chapman brothers' vast gorefest, Hell - comprising tens of thousands of mutilated toy SS soldiers - there was plenty to be outraged about if you were that way inclined.</p> <p>Take the American artist Mike Kelley's snappily titled installation, Extracurricular Activity Projective Reconstruction #1 (A Domestic Scene), where the ghost of the poet Sylvia Plath appears to two suicidal gay men and beckons them to follow her into immortality by sticking their heads into a gas oven.</p> <p>Janet Oakley, a visitor from Nottingham, was not amused, although she had no qualms about Darren Almond's copy of two bus stops from Auschwitz: \"Now they sent a chill down my spine.\"</p> <p>But she was less than complimentary about the Chapmans' swastika-shaped panopticon of horrors, which the academy's flamboyant impresario Norman Rosenthal compared to the best of Goya, Brueghel and Bosch. \"I thought it was puerile and childish, full of the sort of awful things that horrid little boys do to their toys.\"</p> <p>Nor was she impressed at having to crawl into the opening piece, Maurizio Cattelan's disorientating and claustrophobic Cellar \"on my hands and knees. How are older people going to get around that?\"</p> <p>Mrs Oakley, however, admitted that her tastes ran to the more conservative and that she was more of a fan of the academy's slightly stale summer exhibition. \"It was nice to see a few painters for a change, and I did love [Mariko Mori's] beautiful meditation temple and Jeff Koons's Balloon Dog, but it was spoiled for me when someone pointed out that it reminded them of a plaited penis.\"</p> <p>No doubt there will also be much grinding of dentures over Tim Noble and Sue Webster's silhouette of themselves made from a pile of rubbish. But for Max Wigram, co-curator of the show with Rosenthal, it was \"a thing of great beauty - and a symbol of their love for each other. When they came to London from Nottingham they couldn't afford materials, so they made things from rubbish for free. Everything in this very delicately-made sculpture was found within spitting distance of their studio, as they so sweetly put it.\"</p> <p>He was equally stout in his defence of the pop video maker Chris Cunningham's flex, a film depicting an abusive relationship in which a woman's fear of rape is graphically spelt out. \"I realise many people will find it disturbing, and I do myself, but it says a lot about the dynamics of abusive relationships in a beautiful way. You can see the influences of renaissance drawings as well as superhero cartoons in there.\"</p> <p>He dismissed descriptions of it as pornographic, although only adults will be allowed to see it. \"This thing over the sex scene is just silly. It lasts less than a second.\"</p> <p>Wigram argued that the Chapman brothers' Hell, displayed in a series of vitrines to make it look like \"a depiction of Waterloo you might find in a stately home\", asked questions about how much evil was \"inherent in human nature\".</p> <p>\"There are no victims in their camps; these soldiers commit atrocities on themselves just for the sake of it. Hell shows just how quickly our disgust with these horrors turns to fascination and how not long afterwards it comes to be seen as entertainment, as toys and playthings.\"</p> <p>For those who would like to take some horror home, there is a large range of merchandise accompanying Apocalypse. \"Horror\" mugs and a limited edition Chapman Industries T-shirt - \u00a325, complete with twin skull and cross-bones that glow in the dark - are on sale.</p> <p>For \u00a32.99 there is a meteorite soap inspired by Cattelan's Pope. \"It is not meant to be offensive per se,\" said Rosenthal. \"I think of the Pope more like a miracle. Just like many people in middle England dream about the Queen, Maurizio as a Catholic dreams about the Pope.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Apocalypse: Beauty and Horror in Contemporary Art, at the Royal Academy in London until December 15.</p> <p><b>Art world's battlefield</b></p> <p>The Royal Academy of the Arts in Piccadilly, London, home of the unfashionable summer show, may seem like a bastion of establishment values, but it has long been a battleground between art's avant garde and reactionaries.</p> <p>One crusty academician declared he would \"love to kick that fellow Picasso in the behind\". That did not stop Norman Rosenthal, ageing enfant terrible behind Apocalypse, including Picasso in his landmark The Spirit of New Painting show in 1981, with then unknowns such as Julian Schnabel.</p> <p>He followed that up with monumental 80s shows such as Italian Art in the 20th century and a German equivalent that made no mention of Nazi artists.</p> <p>But real infamy came with Sensation in 1997 and the furore surrounding a picture of Myra Hindley painted with children's hands. The show, however, launched the Britart pack of young British artists led by Damien Hirst.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\"The horror! The horror!\", cried the dying Kurtz in Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness. Those words were on the lips of outraged traditionalist art lovers yesterday as the Royal Academy opened the doors on Apocalypse, the exhibition that tries to go one step further than its last shocker, Sensation. With conservative Roman Catholics already protesting at a sculpture of the Pope being felled by a meteorite, a mini-storm brewing over a video showing a split second of penetrative sex, not to mention the Chapman brothers' vast gorefest, Hell - comprising tens of thousands of mutilated toy SS soldiers - there was plenty to be outraged about if you were that way inclined. Take the American artist Mike Kelley's snappily titled installation, Extracurricular Activity Projective Reconstruction #1 (A Domestic Scene), where the ghost of the poet Sylvia Plath appears to two suicidal gay men and beckons them to follow her into immortality by sticking their heads into a gas oven. Janet Oakley, a visitor from Nottingham, was not amused, although she had no qualms about Darren Almond's copy of two bus stops from Auschwitz: \"Now they sent a chill down my spine.\" But she was less than complimentary about the Chapmans' swastika-shaped panopticon of horrors, which the academy's flamboyant impresario Norman Rosenthal compared to the best of Goya, Brueghel and Bosch. \"I thought it was puerile and childish, full of the sort of awful things that horrid little boys do to their toys.\" Nor was she impressed at having to crawl into the opening piece, Maurizio Cattelan's disorientating and claustrophobic Cellar \"on my hands and knees. How are older people going to get around that?\" Mrs Oakley, however, admitted that her tastes ran to the more conservative and that she was more of a fan of the academy's slightly stale summer exhibition. \"It was nice to see a few painters for a change, and I did love [Mariko Mori's] beautiful meditation temple and Jeff Koons's Balloon Dog, but it was spoiled for me when someone pointed out that it reminded them of a plaited penis.\" No doubt there will also be much grinding of dentures over Tim Noble and Sue Webster's silhouette of themselves made from a pile of rubbish. But for Max Wigram, co-curator of the show with Rosenthal, it was \"a thing of great beauty - and a symbol of their love for each other. When they came to London from Nottingham they couldn't afford materials, so they made things from rubbish for free. Everything in this very delicately-made sculpture was found within spitting distance of their studio, as they so sweetly put it.\" He was equally stout in his defence of the pop video maker Chris Cunningham's flex, a film depicting an abusive relationship in which a woman's fear of rape is graphically spelt out. \"I realise many people will find it disturbing, and I do myself, but it says a lot about the dynamics of abusive relationships in a beautiful way. You can see the influences of renaissance drawings as well as superhero cartoons in there.\" He dismissed descriptions of it as pornographic, although only adults will be allowed to see it. \"This thing over the sex scene is just silly. It lasts less than a second.\" Wigram argued that the Chapman brothers' Hell, displayed in a series of vitrines to make it look like \"a depiction of Waterloo you might find in a stately home\", asked questions about how much evil was \"inherent in human nature\". \"There are no victims in their camps; these soldiers commit atrocities on themselves just for the sake of it. Hell shows just how quickly our disgust with these horrors turns to fascination and how not long afterwards it comes to be seen as entertainment, as toys and playthings.\" For those who would like to take some horror home, there is a large range of merchandise accompanying Apocalypse. \"Horror\" mugs and a limited edition Chapman Industries T-shirt - \u00a325, complete with twin skull and cross-bones that glow in the dark - are on sale. For \u00a32.99 there is a meteorite soap inspired by Cattelan's Pope. \"It is not meant to be offensive per se,\" said Rosenthal. \"I think of the Pope more like a miracle. Just like many people in middle England dream about the Queen, Maurizio as a Catholic dreams about the Pope.\" \u0095 Apocalypse: Beauty and Horror in Contemporary Art, at the Royal Academy in London until December 15. Art world's battlefield The Royal Academy of the Arts in Piccadilly, London, home of the unfashionable summer show, may seem like a bastion of establishment values, but it has long been a battleground between art's avant garde and reactionaries. One crusty academician declared he would \"love to kick that fellow Picasso in the behind\". That did not stop Norman Rosenthal, ageing enfant terrible behind Apocalypse, including Picasso in his landmark The Spirit of New Painting show in 1981, with then unknowns such as Julian Schnabel. He followed that up with monumental 80s shows such as Italian Art in the 20th century and a German equivalent that made no mention of Nazi artists. But real infamy came with Sensation in 1997 and the furore surrounding a picture of Myra Hindley painted with children's hands. The show, however, launched the Britart pack of young British artists led by Damien Hirst.",

Detectives yesterday appealed for help tracing Jane Andrews, 33, who has disappeared with her white Volkswagen Polo and may have left the country. Police launched a murder inquiry after the body of Thomas Cressman, 39, was found by a business partner in the bedroom of the couple's \u00a3400,000 home in The Maltings, a private residential and business complex in Fulham, south-west London. The discovery was made on Monday afternoon after Mr Cressman's mother, Barbara, was unable to reach her son by phone that morning. Ms Andrews, who spent more than seven years as the Duchess of York's dresser and aide, has been working as a showroom assistant at a jewellers for the last 10 months. She had been due to go into work on Saturday but called in sick. She was last seen outside a neighbour's house on Sunday morning. All ports and airports were put on alert on Monday night and all police forces given Ms Andrews' details. Detective Chief Inspector Jim Dickie, who is heading the murder inquiry, said: \"We are extremely anxious to know the whereabouts of Ms Andrews. We are concerned about her welfare.

Mr Cressman, whose millionaire father, Harry, lives in Florida, was director of several businesses, including a car polish company that he set up last year with Sir Stirling Moss and a company called Covercraft that manufactures specialist car covers. Sir Stirling said yesterday that he was \"very sad and badly shaken\" by his former partner's death.

Accor of France, which has 3,400 hotels around the world, including the Ibis and Novotel chains, admitted that it was talking to Granada Compass about acquiring the chain.</p> <p>The group's shares fell by 5% on the French stock market over concern about it funding the acquisition, which could cost as much as \u00a33bn. Accor said the talks were still exploratory and insisted that it would only make an acquisition if it would increase its earnings capabilities.</p> <p>The City is anxious for Granada Compass, formed in May, to allow Granada to hive off its media business and the hotel chain and focus on its catering business. News of the possible sale helped its shares rise 7.5p to 714.5p, a further recovery of the 20% of value they have lost this month.</p> <p>Despite market speculation that the deal with Accor would be completed by the end of this month, Granada Compass said that the discussions were at \"an early stage\". Other interested bidders include Bass, the pubs and hotel chain which includes Holiday Inn, Crowne Inn and Intercontinental, although sources suggested that it was being squeezed on price by Accor.</p> <p>Granada Compass is expected to sell off all its hotels, which include London's Wardolf and Le Meridien on Piccadilly, as well as the Posthouse and Heritage chains but it will keep the Travelodge business.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Forte's hotel empire is set to change hands again, its owner Granada Compass admitted yesterday, after confirming it was in talks about the sale of its Le Meridien-to-Posthouse chain. In response to a report in the Guardian, the newly merged catering and hotels group said it was conducting a strategic review of its hotel portfolio, which includes the hotels Granada fought so hard for during its hostile bid for Forte five years ago. Granada Compass said it had received \"approaches from a number of parties\". Accor of France, which has 3,400 hotels around the world, including the Ibis and Novotel chains, admitted that it was talking to Granada Compass about acquiring the chain. The group's shares fell by 5% on the French stock market over concern about it funding the acquisition, which could cost as much as \u00a33bn. Accor said the talks were still exploratory and insisted that it would only make an acquisition if it would increase its earnings capabilities. The City is anxious for Granada Compass, formed in May, to allow Granada to hive off its media business and the hotel chain and focus on its catering business. News of the possible sale helped its shares rise 7.5p to 714.5p, a further recovery of the 20% of value they have lost this month. Despite market speculation that the deal with Accor would be completed by the end of this month, Granada Compass said that the discussions were at \"an early stage\". Other interested bidders include Bass, the pubs and hotel chain which includes Holiday Inn, Crowne Inn and Intercontinental, although sources suggested that it was being squeezed on price by Accor. Granada Compass is expected to sell off all its hotels, which include London's Wardolf and Le Meridien on Piccadilly, as well as the Posthouse and Heritage chains but it will keep the Travelodge business.",

The black able seaman, who has not yet been named, shot Lieutenant John Fred Clarkson twice in the head as he was sleeping on board a minesweeper in Simon's Town harbour. The attacker then turned the gun on himself. He died several hours later in hospital. The navy said the two men had argued but did not say over what. On Monday, an inquiry into a killing spree by a black army lieutenant who targeted and murdered white officers at a Bloemfontein military base a year ago released a damning report on the state of race relations in the South African forces after six years of integration and affirmative action. Lieutenant Sibusiso Madubela hunted down white colleagues, murdering eight people and wounding five before he was killed in a shootout. An inquest concluded he was angry over his salary being stopped after he was declared \"absent without leave\" for failing to return promptly from his father's funeral. The report concludes that South Africa's military is still riddled with racism and highly demoralised. \"Racism does exist in the defence force. It manifests itself in many ways,\" the report says. \"It comes in the form of outright abusive language based on cultural origin, failure to empower people, and active attempts to reduce their job responsibilities.\" Among its examples, the inquiry points to instances where the military police were instructed not to search vehicles driven by white soldiers or arrest them if they broke military laws. It says court martials are seen as whites putting blacks on trial, and recommends that black lawyers be appointed as part-time military judges. Morale has declined, in part because of racism and in part because of financial cutbacks, and absences without leave have climbed sharply. The inquiry also concluded that those who were integrated into South Africa's post-apartheid army from the black liberation movements are treated significantly worse than those who served the military under the white regime despite six years of working toward a single force. \"Military culture is in crisis because there have not been exercises to build the much talked about one-army concept,\" the report says.",

      "bodyText": "Just 24 hours after he supposedly switched his campaign against Al Gore to focus on the big political issues, George W Bush found himself making strictly personal headlines again yesterday about his battle with the bottle and the things he said at a meeting with the Queen. In what has now become an obligatory stop on the White House campaign trail, the Republican presidential candidate went cautiously confessional about his past in a Chicago interview with the television talkshow host Oprah Winfrey. \"Alcohol was beginning to compete for my affections - for my wife and my family,\" Mr Bush told the studio audience. \"It was beginning to crowd out my energy and I decided to quit, and it's one of the best decisions I've ever made.\" Mr Bush's former drinking problem has never been a secret, but this was the first time he had talked about it in any detail during this stage of the campaign. Though Mr Bush purports to enjoy the Oprah Winfrey \"touchy-feely\" style of interview, the encounter compelled him to tread a fine line between giving too much away about his closely guarded past excesses, while wooing the show's largely female audience by presenting himself as a redeemed sinner who had given up the booze for the sake of his wife and children. The Republican candidate neither confirmed nor denied that his wife, Laura, had threatened to leave him at the height of his drinking days, which came to an end more than 14 years ago after he went on one last bender in Colorado with a bunch of friends to mark their 40th birthdays. \"There's a lot of speculation,\" Mr Bush admitted, while referring to rumours that his wife had told him, \"It's either you or Jack Daniels\". \"I think she got disappointed some evenings. I was always a fairly disciplined person. I wasn't drinking all the time, but there were some times when she said you need to think about what you're doing. She understood it requires the person involved to make up their own mind,\" Mr Bush said. Earlier, Mr Bush was asked what he was referring to when he said, during his acceptance speech at the Republican convention last month, that there was a time when he had \"needed forgiveness\". \"When my heart turns dark, when I am jealous or when I'm spiteful,\" Mr Bush replied after a pause. \"I'm looking for specifics,\" Winfrey said in reply. \"I know you are, but I'm running for president,\" Mr Bush responded with a laugh. In submitting himself to ordeal by Oprah, the Republican candidate was following in the footsteps of Mr Gore, who appeared on the same show last week. Such prime-time interviews - along with campaign appearances by the candidates on the rival Jay Leno and David Letterman late night chatshows - have become an essential part of the US presidential campaign timetable, as the rivals seek to humanise themselves and to reach swing voters who would not dream of watching a more formal debate or political discussion programme. If they handle such appearances well, the candidates do not just reach out to the shows' target audiences, but also receive hours of \"free media\", as the clips from their interviews are replayed on other channels and news bulletins. Mr Gore was particularly successful in this respect last week when he made fun of himself on the Letterman show. Among the slogans that the Democratic candidate said he was contemplating using in the campaign were, \"Vote for me - or I will come round to your house and explain my 200-page economic plan in excruciating detail\" and, \"I gave you the internet, America, and I can take it back\".

      "body": "<p>France holds its first referendum in nearly a decade on Sunday, amid massive popular indifference to an issue most French voters see as irrelevant: the length of time their president spends in office.</p> <p>At a pro-reform Socialist party meeting in Paris last night, the embattled prime minister, Lionel Jospin, made a brave attempt to interest the record 64% of the electorate who have said that they will not bother to cast their ballot.</p> <p>He said that the constitutional reform that will reduce the presidential term to five years from seven \"may not be the first preoccupation of the French people\", but is nonetheless important for the country's future.</p> <p>Both Mr Jospin and the conservative president, Jacques Chirac, back the change because in theory it will reduce the chance of uncomfortable \"cohabitations\" between governments and presidents from opposing parties that effectively block all major reform.</p> <p>But with a yes vote virtually guaranteed and both main parties agreed on the advantages of the shorter term, which would come into force after parliamentary and presidential elections scheduled for 2002, the campaigning is lacklustre, with electoral enthusiasm all but non-existent.</p> <p>Only the rebel Gaullist Charles Pasqua, a former interior minister, and small far-right and far-left parties have been campaigning against the reform.</p> <p>But matters have not been helped by 250 mayors who are threatening not to organise the vote in their districts in protest at the government's failure to solve such local problems as the extension of a rubbish dump, the closure of a maternity wing and the route of a projected motorway.</p> <p>Although nearly 80% of those who plan to vote say they will cast their ballot in favour of the reform, only 36% of eligible voters in a recent poll said they expected to turn out. The figure is down even on the record low of 37% which launched New Caledonia on the road to independence in a 1988 referendum, and nowhere near the turnout for France's last referendum, on the Maastricht treaty, in 1992.</p> <p>Several politicians have said such a turnout would be a blow to French democracy. \"If the turnout is indeed as low as forecast, it will be our democracy as a whole that will suffer,\" said a leading Socialist, Henri Weber. \"What head of state will dare call a referendum in the future?\"</p> <p>Pollsters say the low turn-out reflects the feelings of most French people that there are more important issues facing the country: soaring fuel prices, which led to this month's crippling blockade of depots, and controversial plans to give limited autonomy to Corsica, which have prompted the resignation of the interior minister.</p> <p>Mr Jospin, whose approval rating has plummeted by 20% since the fuel crisis, is expected within the next few days to announce some form of voter-friendly tax scheme intended to help offset sky-high petrol prices.</p> <p>Nearly half of the voters who plan to abstain from Sunday's referendum say they will do so as a protest over taxes, which are seen as too high, despite a recent \u00a312bn package of cuts to take effect over the next three years.</p>",

At a pro-reform Socialist party meeting in Paris last night, the embattled prime minister, Lionel Jospin, made a brave attempt to interest the record 64% of the electorate who have said that they will not bother to cast their ballot. He said that the constitutional reform that will reduce the presidential term to five years from seven \"may not be the first preoccupation of the French people\", but is nonetheless important for the country's future. Both Mr Jospin and the conservative president, Jacques Chirac, back the change because in theory it will reduce the chance of uncomfortable \"cohabitations\" between governments and presidents from opposing parties that effectively block all major reform. But with a yes vote virtually guaranteed and both main parties agreed on the advantages of the shorter term, which would come into force after parliamentary and presidential elections scheduled for 2002, the campaigning is lacklustre, with electoral enthusiasm all but non-existent. Only the rebel Gaullist Charles Pasqua, a former interior minister, and small far-right and far-left parties have been campaigning against the reform. But matters have not been helped by 250 mayors who are threatening not to organise the vote in their districts in protest at the government's failure to solve such local problems as the extension of a rubbish dump, the closure of a maternity wing and the route of a projected motorway. Although nearly 80% of those who plan to vote say they will cast their ballot in favour of the reform, only 36% of eligible voters in a recent poll said they expected to turn out. The figure is down even on the record low of 37% which launched New Caledonia on the road to independence in a 1988 referendum, and nowhere near the turnout for France's last referendum, on the Maastricht treaty, in 1992. Several politicians have said such a turnout would be a blow to French democracy. \"If the turnout is indeed as low as forecast, it will be our democracy as a whole that will suffer,\" said a leading Socialist, Henri Weber. \"What head of state will dare call a referendum in the future?\" Pollsters say the low turn-out reflects the feelings of most French people that there are more important issues facing the country: soaring fuel prices, which led to this month's crippling blockade of depots, and controversial plans to give limited autonomy to Corsica, which have prompted the resignation of the interior minister. Mr Jospin, whose approval rating has plummeted by 20% since the fuel crisis, is expected within the next few days to announce some form of voter-friendly tax scheme intended to help offset sky-high petrol prices. Nearly half of the voters who plan to abstain from Sunday's referendum say they will do so as a protest over taxes, which are seen as too high, despite a recent \u00a312bn package of cuts to take effect over the next three years.",

The Democratic and Republican conventions have been packed with an unprecedented number of testimonials and introductions and cute jokes and homey anecdotes from wives and daughters, not as background, but as a central part of the campaign: elect this man, the message seemed to be, because he once brought his daughter toast and hot chocolate out in the snow.</p> <p>It is interesting that after the long, boring impeachment, when the American public signalled that it couldn't care less about the private lives of its politicians, it is their private lives that are being endlessly promoted in the new political season. First there was the Gores' popular kiss that lasted several beats longer than it had to, and then there was Joe Lieberman, Gore's running mate, calling his wife Hadassah \"sweetheart\" during his acceptance speech. These are not public displays of affection so much as public displays of functionality. It is as if there is a pornographic picture in the back of everyone's mind of Monica Lewinsky in the oval office, and all the candidates all running as hard as they can against that picture with their own cheery vignettes of conjugal bliss.</p> <p>Part of this year's obsession with first marriages may also be that our politicians are so stage-managed, every gesture, every motion so scripted and second-guessed and polled, that there is some doubt as to who they really are. The media's favourite activity now is covering not the candidates, but their coaching, their pollsters and managers, advisers who tell them to wear greens and beiges, and speech writers who craft their rhetorical swells. You would have to be illiterate and without a television set to think that you are getting anywhere near the real man. Somehow, quite irrationally, this leads to the belief that when the candidates' wives come on to the stage in powder-blue suits, you are tapping in to their real lives.</p> <p>The fact that all of this is scripted, too, that the wives' collages of photographs, and daughters' affectionate reminiscences are also staged, doesn't seem to matter. These women - Tipper Gore, Laura Bush, Gore's daughters Karenna and Kristen, Hadassah Lieberman - are not professionals, or don't seem like professionals, and so there is a feeling when they come to the podium, awkward and shy, like Laura, or giddily cheery, like Tipper, that we are getting closer to the men themselves. But are these women humanising their husbands, or are we just reading a lot about how they humanise them?</p> <p>The candidates' wives are being used in a way that vice-presidents have traditionally been used - to balance the candidate, to compensate for a perceived weakness. The wives are not there to support their husbands but to subtly shift perceptions of them. For instance, George W Bush's drunken past, his volatile emotional side, his tendency to curse New York Times reporters, is counteracted by Laura's down-to-earth sweetness. He is \"grounded\" by her, everyone around them constantly tells us. She tempers his excesses. And in much the same way, Tipper's naturalness is offered by the campaign as an antidote to Gore's stiffness. She says that she has a \"commitment to have fun\" on the campaign trail, which does not seem like a commitment Gore has ever made to anyone about anything.</p> <p>And it is true that, at the convention, Tipper seemed at ease enough for both of them. She danced and sashayed across the stage. She seemed happy to the point of giddiness, and one wondered whether her dose of Prozac may have been a tad too high that day. One big point that the Gore campaign likes to make about Tipper, and one that Karenna Gore (their eldest daughter) made at the convention, is that she is an enfant terrible, a free spirit, albeit a harmless one, who tells reporters whatever is on her mind. Her handlers cannot control her.</p> <p>The message that is put out to the press is that no message can be put out to the press. She is just too authentic, too true to herself. The idea is that you are getting pure, uncensored access to the Gore family. The character of Tipper is meant to counteract everything you have seen or read or know about her husband's lack of spontaneity. In high school she played drums with a girl band called the Wild Cats. She painted a naked self-portrait when she was pregnant. She goes barefoot on Airforce Two. She is Gore's frolicking unselfconscious other half. The plump blonde id of the Gore campaign.</p> <p>Laura, an ex-elementary school librarian, is quintessentially unthreatening in an entirely different way. With her short, sensible hair, bright blue eyes and dowdy style, she is a vague maternal figure who somehow manages to stay vague no matter how many times she speaks or is profiled. When she stood on the podium at the Republican convention there was an absence of slickness, a lack of charisma, of heat and desire, that played well. Much was made of how nervous she was before her speech (\"I get butterflies a little bit thinking about it\") and that nervousness translated into a middle American ordinariness, a modesty that people found appealing.</p> <p>The New York Times headlined its profile of her \"Quiet Strength\", which is exactly the image the Bush campaign was trying to project. Even the \"political problems\" with Laura seem to serve a shrewd function. For instance, she doesn't agree with her husband on all of the issues, such as abortion. She loyally refuses to talk about it. But, in fact, having a wife who disagrees with him in a quiet way can't hurt a candidate seeking women's votes and trying to soften his anti-choice image without alienating his core constituency.</p> <p>And then there is, of course, the great unspoken shadow of the current first lady - the dislike that rises in her wake, and leaves the campaigns scrambling to define exactly how their candidates are not like Hillary Clinton without saying it too directly. Laura says things like: \"I don't really want to talk about the issues that much. I am not that knowledgeable about most issues.\" Tipper says things like: \"With four children and ageing parents I find that I only spend so much time on the issues that I care about, and I spend a lot of time on keeping the family together.\" In other words, we couldn't have two aspiring first ladies less interested in politics.</p> <p>Both campaigns have made quite a show of how their candidates' wives were resistant to public life. Bush recounts over and over how he promised his wife that she would never have to give a political speech before she would agree to marry him, and her friends give accounts that she would trade it all in \"for long afternoons of reading and mornings of gardening, and be utterly happy\". Meanwhile, Gore aides send out reports of how fearful Tipper was that a presidential campaign would consume her family, and how apprehensive she was about her husband's first run for congress.</p> <p>It seems important that the point is made: these are spotlight-shunning, un-power-hungry women. Not shrinking violets, either of them, but women who don't possess a single ounce of vicarious ambition. Either one of them, their campaigns seem to say, will be dragged reluctantly yet dutifully into the oval office. These are the un-Hillarys being displayed for the American public. (Though it should be pointed out that their distaste for political life seems largely theoretical: Laura is being cast by her husband's camp as an extremely reluctant campaigner, but in February alone she reluctantly campaigned in 22 different states.)</p> <p>The wives of America's current candidates are studiedly old-fashioned. Even the Democrats stress that Tipper will be a first lady \"in the traditional mould\". These women are housewives and mothers. They gave up their temporary and unpassionate careers for their husbands in an era when it was no longer common to do so. They devote themselves to their families, and have mild artistic pursuits, such as photography and painting and reading. They present a sweetly pastoral image of American womanhood that has nothing whatsoever to do with American women. Somehow, America seems to want a first lady who represents not the values of the country, but the values of the country 50 years ago.</p> <p>It is a curious pocket of sexism, a pocket of nostalgia, that represents not what women are but an old portrait of them that, some of us at least, apparently still long for: the mother who stays home; the supportive wife; the quiet strength. As if behind every powerful man is a not-so-powerful woman. So far it has worked. Laura Bush and Tipper Gore are both immensely popular. (Though the campaigns are careful not to make it seem like they are too retrograde. For instance, Laura used to refer to herself as \"shy\" and now denies it, as does everyone around her with a regularity so noticeable that the New York Times said it was \"as if they all received the same memo\".)</p> <p>Gore said in his convention speech, \"This is not a popularity contest,\" but, of course, that is exactly what it is. Today's candidates have to be liked, and known in the manner of the captain of the football team. Neither Gore nor Bush are particularly adept at giving the crucial illusion of intimacy, of making the voter feel like they know him, making the voter dream about him, the way Bill Clinton famously is. Without that gift for intimacy the voter has to be drawn into the candidate's kitchen by other means. They have to feel like they have been invited over to dinner and chatted with. To do what Clinton could do with a bite of his lip, with a throaty laugh, with a lazy smile, these candidates have to call in reserves - their pleasant, unthreatening wives.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The three businessmen convicted 10 years ago of taking part in an illegal share support operation with the former Guinness chairman Ernest Saunders were denied a fair trial, the European court of human rights in Strasbourg ruled yesterday. Gerald Ronson, Jack Lyons and Anthony Parnes were found guilty in 1990 of colluding in an unlawful scheme set up to support the Guinness takeover of the Distillers company. But the prosecution's reliance on transcripts of interviews with the men by Department of Trade inspectors during the inquiry into the takeover breached their right not to incriminate themselves, a key element of the right to a fair trial, the seven judges held unanimously. The men were compelled by statute to answer the inspectors' questions and could have faced two years in jail had they refused. During their criminal trial, the prosecution spent three days reading out parts of the transcripts of the interviews to the jury \"in a manner intended to incriminate them\", the judges said. Yesterday's ruling, which does not affect the men's convictions, was inevitable because the court made the same finding four years ago in a case brought by Saunders, dealing a blow to efforts to tackle city corruption. After the Saunders ruling, the government conceded that the use of DTI interviews in criminal trials breached the European convention on human rights and prosecuting authorities stopped using them. But the Strasbourg court dismissed other complaints by the trio about the fairness of their trial, and refused to award them damages. The three men had argued that their right to a fair trial was also violated by improper collusion between the DTI and prosecutors, non-disclosure of material relevant to their defence, and the length of time it took for the proceedings against them to finish. Ronson's solicitors, Mishcon de Reya, said they were \"examining the judgment in detail and the options concerning future action\". Parnes's solicitor, Keith Oliver of Peters &amp; Peters, said: \"The options obviously include making application for the convictions to be set aside.\" The DTI investigation into Guinness's acquisition of Distillers was launched in November 1986, after allegations of an illegal share support operation to guarantee the success of the bid. Saunders was charged in May 1987 with false accounting, theft and the destruction of documents. Lyons, a financier, Gerald Ronson, chairman of Heron International, and Anthony Parnes, a trader, were charged with conspiracy, false accounting and theft. All three maintained that the share operations were common practice and could not be classified as a crime, and they denied all charges at their trial. In August 1990 Saunders was convicted and jailed for five years. The others were also convicted. Ronson, whose Heron Group received a \u00a35m success fee and an \u00a3800,000 indemnity against share losses, was jailed for 12 months and fined a record \u00a35m. Parnes was jailed for 30 months, while Lyons was spared a prison sentence because of ill health. Appeals were rejected in May 1991 and in 1995. Permission to appeal to the House of Lords was refused. Lyons, 84, who was stripped of his knighthood after the original verdict, said: \"The last 12 years have been very difficult for me, for my family and for my friends. I welcome this judgment so that I may yet be able to enjoy a little of my retirement, without the cloud of injustice hanging over me.\"",

      "bodyText": "Spanish police seized a cache of arms and explosives from what they believe to be a command centre used by the Basque separatist group Eta near Bilbao yesterday as they consolidated a full frontal assault on the organisation ordered by Spain's prime minister, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar. Mop-up operations continued in the aftermath of one of the harshest blows ever dealt the group. Thirty six people have been arrested, over the past week, including the man believed to be Eta's top military commander, Ignacio Gracia Arregui. Eta ended a 14-month truce at the start of the year and began a campaign of violence that has caused 12 deaths. Spain's security chiefs say they have virtually destroyed Eta's military and support structure in a series of raids on safe houses and headquarters belonging to the group's political wing which began last Wednesday but followed months of coordinated planning with French police. The offensive came at a time when the security forces were under strong political pressure to counter an escalation in attacks aimed at politicians, journalists and businessmen critical of Eta. But Mr Aznar and his tough-minded interior minister, Jaime Mayor Oreja, himself a Basque, have been careful not to cry victory. Past experience has shown Eta's capacity to recover and restructure. In 1992, the group's three top military leaders were seized in Bidart just over the French border. It has taken eight years for Mr Arregui, the man who rebuilt Eta's commandos, to be captured, once again in Bidart. Mr Aznar is determined not to repeat the mistake he believes was made in 1992 by limiting his offensive to police action. For that reason he has launched simultaneous judicial and political initiatives aimed at curbing the activities of fringe organisations linked to Eta and at ousting the non-violent Basque Nationalist Party (PNV), the largest in the area, from the regional government. Mr Arregui's arrest followed a round-up of 20 activists linked to the separatist party Euskal Herritarrok which has close ties to Eta. Spain's national court is preparing charges against 18 of them on the grounds that they collaborated with Eta. People thought to be Eta's explosives experts and key technicians were rounded up over the weekend in a further wave of arrests, mostly in France. Harsh penalties have also been introduced for those involved in so-called low level violence mainly youth groups linked to Eta who are thought to number 3,000 people. The operation is similar to one carried out against separatist political leaders and fundraisers in 1997. Analysts of the Basque situation believe it was an important factor in persuading the group to reconsider its tactics and join forces with the PNV, relinquishing violence in return for concerted political action. But the initiative floundered after voting patterns in the Basque country remained unaltered giving those who wish to remain Spanish an edge over those who see themselves as totally or predominantly Basque. Mr Aznar now wants to force early regional elections in the Basque country which he hopes will be won by non-nationalist forces led by his own People's party. The hardline he assumed throughout Eta's 14-month ceasefire continues. \"We cannot negotiate in return for peace,\" he insists, arguing that Basques are free to pursue political change through existing institutions set up when Spain adopted a democratic constitution 22 years ago. Meanwhile Mr Oreja has warned that the battle against terrorism is not over and that the steady decline in support for Eta makes it more likely that the group will adopt a \"bunker mentality\" rallying its supporters with violent attacks and denigration of the existing devolution system.",

The public - or at least, the public who watch home-shopping channels - don't like the hustle and bustle of ordinary shopping. They visit the Ideal Homes Exhibition to see the \"stars\" of QVC, ogling them with an adoration normally reserved for pop stars and David Jason, and showering them with compliments like \"she is the personification of elegance\" despite it being blatantly untrue. Thus, this public gets imitation diamonds, home hair-removal kits and toilet-seat warmers, paid for in two easy payments and all without the hassle of leaving the house.

The trophies of the presenting team - Debbie Flint, formerly a presenter on British Forces television, Paul Lavers, runner-up in last year's cable TV personality of the year, and Steve Whatley, the gadget man from This Morning - were, in their own individual ways, quite repellent.

Perhaps that man from the Claims Direct advert who received \u00a313,000 after suffering an accident at work. In between queeny fits, hilarious incompetence all round and praying for death threats (though, oddly, not on each other), Ideal went on air on time (\"Live from Peterborough!\") And people phoned in.

It almost beggars belief. </p> <p>When Strindberg described the family as \"home of all social evils, a charitable institution for indolent women, a prison workshop for the slaving breadwinner and a hell for children\", he hadn't even seen <strong> My Family</strong> (BBC1).

Three quite different couples, with a more positive view of families than Strindberg, were being assessed as potential adoptive parents, with each set of circumstances illuminating the process of adoption as a whole. It made for moving television. </p> <p>Linda and Tony from Leeds were worried that the bedroom they had set aside for a prospective child might be considered too small; Paula and Al left the decisions in God's hands; while Mark and Sarah were adopting a \"special needs\" child from China.

Twin Peaks (pictured). You can watch it on cable but I think a new series with the original cast would be fantastic. I loved that programme, I've got all the videos and I even managed to get a letter off David Lynch after I wrote a few to him. I hope it was him, anyway, I'm sure it's real. I do like watching other programmes on TV. I enjoy Countdown and Fifteen To One and I like Top Of The Pops 2 because it features so many interesting groups from years ago. I didn't like the Robbie Williams one, because I don't like him at all - he's a show off.\" Serena Pye: \"I watch the Big Breakfast to help me get up in the morning, and I hate it, but the other programmes are so boring. I do watch Star Trek but I'm more of a Doctor Who fan myself so I watch old videos and spend time on the internet or reading. If I could be on any programme I'd be Jeremy Paxman on Newsnight, or Jeremy Clarkson. Hahahahahaha! I do have a car, it's a Cavalier. I go up to the moon in it.\"",

Although the order was accused before her death three years ago of unwisely accepting donations from dictators and crooks, this is the first time in 50 years an allegation of abuse has been made against it. </p> <p>The girl's father, Kaviran Mondal, a local rag picker, filed a criminal case against the Missionaries of Charity and Sister Francesco following the incident last week, which took place at the mission's home for destitute children in central Calcutta. The girl - Karabi Mondal - was one of 100 children living at the hostel. </p> <p>According to sources close to the investigation, Karabi was blamed after neighbours in the house next door complained that some of their jewellery had been stolen. As a punishment, Sister Francesco allegedly placed the girl's hand on a hot plate used for cooking chapatis. The burns were so severe the girl requires a skin graft. \"The sister had a Catholic penchant for punishment,\" a source said. </p> <p>Speaking on local television, Mr Mondal, who has another daughter also cared for by the charity, said: \"We looked upon Mother Teresa as a god. We never imagined this could happen here. It is unbelievable.\" </p> <p>\"This particular sister has beaten and hurt other children. I don't want to blame the whole organisation. She doesn't know limits,\" he added. </p> <p>Mr Mondal said that he was too poor to look after his own children. </p> <p>Karabi had been at the hostel for six months, while the nuns had cared for her sister for two years. Their father was alerted to what had happened after the older girl rushed to tell him that Karabi had been hurt. The family is now living in Bow Bazaar, a Calcutta slum. </p> <p>Sister Nirmala, who was elected head of the order following Mother Teresa's death, was last night unavailable for comment. But on leaving court last week she said: \"The truth will come out. We will co-operate with the judicial process. Beyond that I can't say anything.\" </p> <p>The sister, described by one source as \"shy\", \"retiring\" and with Mother Teresa's \"spirit\", is believed not to dispute that the incident took place and to have said: \"We should love children, not punish them.\" </p> <p>In a withering revisionist biography, The Missionary Position, published in 1995, the journalist Christopher Hitchens rounded on Mother Teresa for accepting donations from Jean-Claude \"Baby Doc\" Duvalier, the former dictator of Haiti, and from fraudsters such as Robert Maxwell and Charles Keating, the California banker jailed in the Savings and Loan scandal. Other critics have complained of the order's opposition to birth control, and the primitive medical regime in its clinics. </p> <p>But last night Navin Chawla, Mother Teresa's Indian biographer, said he was surprised by the allegation of abuse. \"This is the first such case I have come across in 23 years. I can only put it down as a freak thing,\" he said. \"As for the complaint that the order runs primitive medical regimes, Mother Teresa used to take people from the streets after they had been refused by every other hospital. It is very hard to get into a hospital in India if you are poor.\" </p> <p>Following Mother Teresa's death in September 1997, the Pope took the unprecedented step of scrapping the traditional five-year waiting period for beatification. </p> <p>The Missionaries of Charity, which has its world headquarters in Calcutta, has campaigned vigorously for her sainthood. Last summer the process of canonisation formally began, when 100 witnesses gave evidence before a three-man tribunal. The Vatican is expected to wait another two or three years before confirming her as Saint Teresa.</p>",

Beyond that I can't say anything.\" The sister, described by one source as \"shy\", \"retiring\" and with Mother Teresa's \"spirit\", is believed not to dispute that the incident took place and to have said: \"We should love children, not punish them.\" In a withering revisionist biography, The Missionary Position, published in 1995, the journalist Christopher Hitchens rounded on Mother Teresa for accepting donations from Jean-Claude \"Baby Doc\" Duvalier, the former dictator of Haiti, and from fraudsters such as Robert Maxwell and Charles Keating, the California banker jailed in the Savings and Loan scandal. Other critics have complained of the order's opposition to birth control, and the primitive medical regime in its clinics. But last night Navin Chawla, Mother Teresa's Indian biographer, said he was surprised by the allegation of abuse. \"This is the first such case I have come across in 23 years. I can only put it down as a freak thing,\" he said. \"As for the complaint that the order runs primitive medical regimes, Mother Teresa used to take people from the streets after they had been refused by every other hospital. It is very hard to get into a hospital in India if you are poor.\" Following Mother Teresa's death in September 1997, the Pope took the unprecedented step of scrapping the traditional five-year waiting period for beatification. The Missionaries of Charity, which has its world headquarters in Calcutta, has campaigned vigorously for her sainthood. Last summer the process of canonisation formally began, when 100 witnesses gave evidence before a three-man tribunal. The Vatican is expected to wait another two or three years before confirming her as Saint Teresa.",

They didn't set out to do it: producers, directors, critics and arts administrators have all written rep's obituary and proclaimed the need for new policies to suit a time of declining, ageing theatre audiences and soaring deficits. But the \u00a36.25m theatre, built in the style of a barn and housing a 400-seat auditorium and an 80-seat studio, has shown that it is still possible to mount a season of plays using a company of actors hired on extended contracts. </p> <p>Since August 1999, TbtL has presented 10 plays (nine home-produced, one joint production) and a series of films and imported shows and concerts. It has staged 419 performances, sold 82,000 tickets and broken even on public funding of just \u00a3130,000 (about a quarter of what other theatres of comparable size receive). It served the summer-season tourists who flock to the Lake District but also won a completely new Cumbrian audience: A Christmas Carol played to 95% capacity in December and January. </p> <p>\"Our original business plan included three plays for the summer and then perhaps another the following Easter,\" says Patric Gilchrist, the executive director. \"But we have turned out to be much more of a producing theatre than was ever thought possible.\" </p> <p>All this runs contrary to the kind of mixed economy (a financially astute blend of home-grown, touring and bought-in shows) that the Arts Council proclaimed was the new reality when it reported in May on what it called \"an art form in crisis\".

Four more have been added, and if you nip up to the Lakes for an autumn break you could see all five in a week. </p> <p>\"If this policy works again next year, things could get scary,\" says Gilchrist. \"The danger is that people will say that if we have done it once, we can do it again.\" </p> <p>It worked because he and his artistic director Ian Forrest made unreasonable demands on themselves and their staff: Forrest directed nine plays in a year and Gilchrist has had five days off in two years. \"Part of my reason for coming here was my belief that it was possible for a small regional theatre to redefine how it operates within existing levels of funding,\" adds Gilchrist, who had been at Clywd Theatr Cymru for 11 years. \"But we go forward knowing that we will need a bit more money if we are to deliver the range of work we set out to deliver, including youth and community programmes. In the year to March 31, we incurred no deficit. This year we are working on a budget that doesn't yet balance, although we are not so far away as to make the whole operation unrealistic or unreasonable.\" </p> <p>The theatre has been helped by a \u00a375,000 reserve fund accumulated by the former Century Theatre, which operated in the Blue Box, a mobile auditorium that was built for postwar touring and came to rest in the car park where TbtL now stands. </p> <p>\"If we are to continue with our present level of work, we could sustain it for two years.

You tend to think of Julius Caesar as an old man's play, a gift for a trio of elderly actors physically past their prime. But Shakespeare was still a relatively young man in his early 30s when he wrote it. It is, suggests Lan, the last young play of a young playwright. </p> <p>There is more to the Young Vic's marketing strategy than just an advertising campaign in the style of those English National Opera posters a few years back that tried to persuade a doubtful public that opera has nothing to do with fat people singing and everything to do with sex. Lan's proposition is that Julius Caesar as a play about active soldiers, young men bound by friendship and love and destroyed by it. What interests him is the evident absorption of Shakespeare in the relationships between the main characters. </p> <p>By casting Dorian Healy as Julius Caesar, Marcus D'Amico as Cassius and Lloyd Owen as Brutus - all good-looking actors in their 30s - he seems likely to come up with a production that will challenge our preconception that Julius Caesar is primarily a political play. But while Lan is keen to explore the sensuality of the play and the psychological detail of what he calls \"this grown-up male drama\", this is certainly not an attempt to stage the first gay Julius Caesar. Lan is far too perceptive for such a crudity. </p> <p>The South African-born Lan, who trained as an actor and then came to Britain aged 20, has always had the capacity to surprise. Even his appointment earlier this year as the successor to Tim Supple at the Young Vic came out of the blue. This, after all, is a man with only two directorial credits to his name in this country - a widely ignored production of The Glass Menagerie at Watford in 1998, and a superb 'Tis Pity She's a Whore with Jude Law at the Young Vic last autumn. </p> <p>Until Lan took that Jacobean thriller and turned it inside out, he was mainly known in the theatre world as a playwright. In another incarnation he was an anthropologist, spending two years in the 1980s living in a small village in the Zambezi studying the effects of the guerrilla war on religious beliefs of the local community. </p> <p>Out of that came a classic anthropological text, Guns and Rain: Guerillas and Spirit Mediums in Zimbabwe, and Desire, a beautiful, wonderfully unfashionable play about possession and the exorcism of guilt. It premiered at the Almeida in 1990 and completed a trilogy begun 10 years previously, which encompassed shamanism and Melanesian cargo cults. As Stephen Daldry of the Royal Court has noted, even when he began his writing career back in the 1970s, Lan \"was never part of the dominant ethos which suggested that a playwright's responsibility was to depict and analyse contemporary life in, say, Brixton or Moss Side\". </p> <p>Some years ago a critic, reviewing one of Lan's plays, observed that Lan's was a theatrical career that had never quite coalesced. But everything seems to be coming together nicely now, as the various strands of Lan's long apprenticeship in the theatre and life begin to tie up. Anthropology and theatre have much in common, not least in the way that they explore the nature of ritual. But Lan's own plays are only the tip of an iceberg in a career that includes documentary film-making, translation (his new version of The Cherry Orchard premieres at the National Theatre the night after Julius Caesar opens), extensive work with playwrights and screenwriters and two years spent as writer in residence at the Royal Court in the mid-1990s. Here he became the unsung hero of the new-writing boom, nurturing scripts through the process from development to final production. \"Your brief,\" Daldry told Lan, \"is to do what ever you like until you meet resistance.\" </p> <p>\"I worked with people on the basis that there was no deal,\" Lan recalls. \"I'd be around as long as people wanted me to be there and then I wouldn't. It worked. On many plays I became an unofficial producer.\" </p> <p>Without that experience at the Court, Lan would never have considered applying for the Young Vic job. But working closely with Daldry may stand Lan in good stead in other ways, if his ambitious plans for the Young Vic are to be realised. The redevelopment of the Court is testament to the fact that Daldry has no equal in British theatre when it comes to fundraising. \"I learned such a lot from Stephen. How could one not? If we're going to rebuild, I need to learn more.\" </p> <p>At 48, Lan considers himself too old to be running the Young Vic. He would like it to return to its original ethos of being a theatre where the young inspire the young. \"I want 27-year-olds directing King Lear,\" he says, while pointing out that the current funding situation means that the theatre can only produce three or four in-house shows every year. That, and the need to generate 60% of the theatre's income from the box office, means that Lan has already discovered that \"the pressure to be conservative is great\". </p> <p>Then there is the small problem that the building is falling down even faster now than it was 30 years ago, when the first schemes to rebuild it were hatched. None have ever come to fruition, in part because nobody has ever come up with a way to improve upon the current auditorium, one of the most attractive spaces in the country. But if anyone can get the job done, Lan has to be the man, not least because for him the Young Vic is a passion, whereas for his much younger predecessors Tim Supple and David Thacker it was also a career move. Lan didn't need to run a theatre, he just wanted to, and it wasn't any theatre he wanted to run, but the Young Vic in particular. </p> <p>In the publicity for Julius Caesar, Lan poses questions about the way \"some men lead and others follow\" and \"the enchantment of power\", an anthropologist's concept if ever there was one. I wonder whether his nine months at the Young Vic have given him an insight into that enchantment. </p> <p>He smiles, looking pale as a ghost and completely exhausted. \"I knew in the abstract that this was a big job, but the abstract became concrete very quickly. The thing I've really learned is that as quickly as you put things together they fall apart.\" </p> <p> Julius Caesar opens at the Young Vic, London SE1, tonight. Box office: 020-7926 6363.</p>",

But everything seems to be coming together nicely now, as the various strands of Lan's long apprenticeship in the theatre and life begin to tie up. Anthropology and theatre have much in common, not least in the way that they explore the nature of ritual. But Lan's own plays are only the tip of an iceberg in a career that includes documentary film-making, translation (his new version of The Cherry Orchard premieres at the National Theatre the night after Julius Caesar opens), extensive work with playwrights and screenwriters and two years spent as writer in residence at the Royal Court in the mid-1990s. Here he became the unsung hero of the new-writing boom, nurturing scripts through the process from development to final production. \"Your brief,\" Daldry told Lan, \"is to do what ever you like until you meet resistance.\" \"I worked with people on the basis that there was no deal,\" Lan recalls. \"I'd be around as long as people wanted me to be there and then I wouldn't. It worked. On many plays I became an unofficial producer.\" Without that experience at the Court, Lan would never have considered applying for the Young Vic job. But working closely with Daldry may stand Lan in good stead in other ways, if his ambitious plans for the Young Vic are to be realised. The redevelopment of the Court is testament to the fact that Daldry has no equal in British theatre when it comes to fundraising. \"I learned such a lot from Stephen. How could one not? If we're going to rebuild, I need to learn more.\" At 48, Lan considers himself too old to be running the Young Vic. He would like it to return to its original ethos of being a theatre where the young inspire the young. \"I want 27-year-olds directing King Lear,\" he says, while pointing out that the current funding situation means that the theatre can only produce three or four in-house shows every year. That, and the need to generate 60% of the theatre's income from the box office, means that Lan has already discovered that \"the pressure to be conservative is great\". Then there is the small problem that the building is falling down even faster now than it was 30 years ago, when the first schemes to rebuild it were hatched. None have ever come to fruition, in part because nobody has ever come up with a way to improve upon the current auditorium, one of the most attractive spaces in the country. But if anyone can get the job done, Lan has to be the man, not least because for him the Young Vic is a passion, whereas for his much younger predecessors Tim Supple and David Thacker it was also a career move. Lan didn't need to run a theatre, he just wanted to, and it wasn't any theatre he wanted to run, but the Young Vic in particular. In the publicity for Julius Caesar, Lan poses questions about the way \"some men lead and others follow\" and \"the enchantment of power\", an anthropologist's concept if ever there was one. I wonder whether his nine months at the Young Vic have given him an insight into that enchantment. He smiles, looking pale as a ghost and completely exhausted. \"I knew in the abstract that this was a big job, but the abstract became concrete very quickly. The thing I've really learned is that as quickly as you put things together they fall apart.\" Julius Caesar opens at the Young Vic, London SE1, tonight. Box office: 020-7926 6363.",

De Botton, who has died aged 65, was a powerful, immensely respected financier, with many friends among the great, the good and the super-rich. Yet he began his career as a penniless Sephardic Jew in the conservative banking environment of Zurich, with no family or connections, isolated and lonely.</p> <p>Born in Alexandria, he attended the Hebrew University of Jerusalem before taking an MA at Columbia University, New York. In 1960, he joined the Zilkha family's investment vehicle, Ufltec, in Zurich. In 1968, he was introduced to Jacob (now Lord) Rothschild, at a time when the family was opening a new bank in Switzerland, Rothschild Bank AG. They started with a tiny office and the \"genius\" - as Gilbert had been described - and business grew exponentially. He moved briefly to New York to take care of the Rothschild interests there until 1983, when he decided to go it alone.</p> <p>Gilbert moved to London, founded Global Asset Management (GAM), of which he owned 60% and Jacob Rothschild 40%, and set about changing the way the money of the really wealthy was invested: no longer a safe split between equities and bonds handled in-house by the relevant departments of the firm, but a global and imaginative delegation to the truly knowledgeable.</p> <p>Gilbert searched the world for expert in each investment area, be it Japanese bonds, American stocks or European currencies. He spread his increasingly large portfolio of assets under management among them, according to his assessment of the risk involved in each area; he started with \u00a3lm and ended with more than \u00a310bn. It was a brilliant strategy, and it resulted in GAM being sold in 1999 to UBS for more than \u00a3420m, an extraordinary price for a company whose assets were mostly know-how, contacts and credibility.</p> <p>In those characteristics, the firm reflected its boss. Gilbert was a brilliant man, with the intellectual power to absorb, analyse and understand a mind-boggling amount of information. He was also cultured, suave, witty, modest and authoritative - an impossible combination to resist when first meeting him.</p> <p>A new client would be invited for lunch in GAM's elegant St James's office, served with delicious, but very light, food and, as the butler took the coffee cups, Gilbert would nonchalantly say: \"Let's see how the markets are doing today\", while opening a concealed drawer in the table.</p> <p>A Bond film scene would ensue: shutters would close, blinds come down, the 18th century mirror would come to light with a back-projected screen showing, in vivid colours, the day's activities or, better still, GAM's impressive track record. The client was hooked. Credibility came from Gilbert's total reliability, and his obsessive attention to confidentiality.</p> <p>Gilbert was also a world expert on the 16th-century French thinker Michel de Montaigne, and had amassed an immense library devoted to his work. Though sometimes aloof - Francis Bacon said to Lucian Freud that Gilbert reminded him of an ancient Egyptian - and often short-tempered with those closest to him, he managed, on the whole, to appear always smiling and courteous and, particularly in recent years, seemed to start relaxing in the happiness that his second wife, Janet Wolfson, brought him.</p> <p>Both loved art, if not perhaps the same art. Gilbert recognised early the greatness of Picasso's late paintings, and collected the best of them. He bought Freud before it was fashionable, and the painter introduced him to Francis Bacon: both made portraits of Gilbert. Freud worked for a long time on a large canvas, and, realising months later that the picture did not work, started again on a smaller canvas - without the slightest protest from his busy sitter.</p> <p>Gilbert was also a great benefactor of the Tate Gallery, a trustee (1985-92), the first chairman of both the Tate Gallery Foundation and of the museum's international council. A major gallery of the fifth floor of Tate Modern is named after him.</p> <p>Ultimately, he was a great intellectual, a scholar who enjoyed applying purity of thought to everything he did, as if to follow in the tradition of a family steeped in learning since the 16th century. His articles on Montaigne, or the world economy, were as subtle as they were learned and sophisticated in construction, and he was immensely proud that his son Alain had become a famous writer. A short and wiry man, he will be remembered by his many friends for his good heart and captivating smile.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife, and two children from his earlier marriage to Jacqueline Burgauer.</p> <p>\u0095 Gilbert de Botton, banker and art benefactor, born February 16 1935; died August 27 2000</p>",

A new client would be invited for lunch in GAM's elegant St James's office, served with delicious, but very light, food and, as the butler took the coffee cups, Gilbert would nonchalantly say: \"Let's see how the markets are doing today\", while opening a concealed drawer in the table. A Bond film scene would ensue: shutters would close, blinds come down, the 18th century mirror would come to light with a back-projected screen showing, in vivid colours, the day's activities or, better still, GAM's impressive track record. The client was hooked. Credibility came from Gilbert's total reliability, and his obsessive attention to confidentiality. Gilbert was also a world expert on the 16th-century French thinker Michel de Montaigne, and had amassed an immense library devoted to his work. Though sometimes aloof - Francis Bacon said to Lucian Freud that Gilbert reminded him of an ancient Egyptian - and often short-tempered with those closest to him, he managed, on the whole, to appear always smiling and courteous and, particularly in recent years, seemed to start relaxing in the happiness that his second wife, Janet Wolfson, brought him. Both loved art, if not perhaps the same art. Gilbert recognised early the greatness of Picasso's late paintings, and collected the best of them. He bought Freud before it was fashionable, and the painter introduced him to Francis Bacon: both made portraits of Gilbert. Freud worked for a long time on a large canvas, and, realising months later that the picture did not work, started again on a smaller canvas - without the slightest protest from his busy sitter. Gilbert was also a great benefactor of the Tate Gallery, a trustee (1985-92), the first chairman of both the Tate Gallery Foundation and of the museum's international council. A major gallery of the fifth floor of Tate Modern is named after him. Ultimately, he was a great intellectual, a scholar who enjoyed applying purity of thought to everything he did, as if to follow in the tradition of a family steeped in learning since the 16th century. His articles on Montaigne, or the world economy, were as subtle as they were learned and sophisticated in construction, and he was immensely proud that his son Alain had become a famous writer. A short and wiry man, he will be remembered by his many friends for his good heart and captivating smile. He is survived by his wife, and two children from his earlier marriage to Jacqueline Burgauer. \u0095 Gilbert de Botton, banker and art benefactor, born February 16 1935; died August 27 2000",

      "bodyText": "An emergency meeting of European Union transport ministers has been switched from Brussels to Luxembourg today in an attempt to head off anticipated protests by truckers protesting against the high price of petrol. Demonstrations continued across Europe yesterday as farmers, truckers and fishermen did their utmost to extract tax cuts from bewildered governments. For the first time, demon strations spread to Israel, where angry truckers staged a go-slow along the main road linking Haifa with Ashdod. The European Union believes the protests are set to worsen and today's emergency meeting of transport ministers will discuss harmonising national Vat regimes for fuel and will assess what action can be taken to aid Europe's ailing transport sector. It is not expected to reach any firm conclusions, diplomats revealed yesterday, and is more likely to be used by the UK as an opportunity to question whether other governments' concessions are in line with EU law. There were few signs yesterday, however, that protesters will be pacified by mealy-mouthed political pledges. In Spain, 100,000 farmers drove their tractors through the centre of Madrid and other cities around the country, while the two biggest farming unions warned they would bring the country to a halt unless the government acted. \"We are the first ants of the swarm ... in October we'll cut off roads wherever we have to in order to reach our objective,\" one union official told a noisy rally in Madrid. German truckers and taxi drivers also flexed their muscles in an attempt to shake concessions from the chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der. Around 300 trucks, buses and taxis blew their horns in unison as they circled Hamburg's inner ring road and traffic was disrupted elsewhere too. \"We will not allow ourselves to be taxed into the abyss,\" read a slogan in one of the many protests to take place across Germany. Meanwhile, in Israel truckers warned that yesterday's massive go-slow could only be the tip of the iceberg and should be seen as \"a warning shot.\" In Scandinavia, Sweden's second largest port, Gothenburg, was snarled for the second day in a row as truckers hampered the movement of freight. Blockades of the ports at Malmo and Stockholm also showed no signs of abating. In Ireland fishermen tied up their boats at midday and stopped work for a 24-hour period. A spokesman complained that fishermen had been hit with a 180% rise in fuel costs in the last 18 months.",

And it came on the day the Tories planned to launch a new offensive in the petrol political war - a proposed cut in fuel duty. In his first of a two-pronged attack on a floundering Labour Party, Mr Portillo called for the chancellor to leave office for having allegedly deliberately misled the public over the gift from motor racing chief Bernie Ecclestone. He said Mr Brown's own spokesman had revealed in a statement yesterday, that the chancellor knew about the donation three days before he was interviewed on the BBC radio programme Today, saying he did not.

But the political atmosphere worsened with the claims in a book by the journalist Andrew Rawnsley that Mr Blair and the chancellor, Gordon Brown, had lied over their handling of the Ecclestone affair. Margaret Beckett, the leader of the house, was wheeled out to discuss the fuel crisis and the Guardian poll on Radio 4's Today programme, only to find herself being questioned over the Rawnsley allegations. She claimed she knew nothing of the claims and had not read the newspapers, dismissing the affair as an old story. As the day wore on, Labour's rebuttal team worked on knocking down the Rawnsley allegations point by point, producing detailed transcripts and original letters, and challenging the veracity of his unsourced quotes. But inside the beleaguered Treasury, the mood darkened as Mr Brown recognised he had to admit he had discussed the Ecclestone donations with the prime minister. Meanwhile, at yesterday's meeting of Labour's national executive committee, anxious members expressed concern that the sudden reversal in the opinion polls is not just a short-term blip.

      "body": "<p>The tone of the conversation was light-hearted, almost banal. </p> <p>As Warren Moore, popular drivetime presenter on the commercial radio station Red Dragon FM, jokingly put his newsreader Stuart McTeer on the spot about rumours of new fuel blockades, he could not have dreamt of the storm which was about to be unleashed. </p> <p>By next morning queues were forming on forecourts of petrol stations in Dragon FM's south Wales constituency. By noon the panic was spreading across the country. Petrol station managers from Cornwall to Scotland were being besieged by frantic motorists. Some were rationing fuel, others were having to turn off their pumps because they were overheating. </p> <p>A nationwide police operation co-ordinated from Scotland Yard swung into action. The leader of the House of Commons was rushed in front of the cameras to lend a hand in the firefighting exercise. And the government's enemies were once again making political capital of the panic. </p> <p><strong> Rumour</strong><br> </p> <p> The day - described by one senior police officer as \"simply mad\" - was a vivid illustration of how easily another real fuel crisis could bring the country to its knees. It also gave the psychologists an insight into the power of rumour and the rather British proclivity to panic buy. </p> <p>Last night Red Dragon FM, which boasts a listenership of 301,000, was doing its own firefighting exercise in trying to play down its role in the chaos. It claimed that the rumour had not started at the Cardiff-based station, though station bosses conceded they had repeated it. </p> <p>According to Texaco, Red Dragon rang it after the conversation was broadcast. Spokeswoman Nicole Hutchings said: \"The radio station rang us to seek clarification. There was absolutely no truth in the rumour but once it has been broadcast it is obviously very hard to quash it.\" </p> <p>Throughout the evening Red Dragon put out bulletins stressing that there was to be no new blockade. But it was too late: the genie was out of the bottle. </p> <p>Down the road at Cardiff General Service Station, manager Brian Smith had been enjoying seeing business getting back to normal after last week's trauma.

      "bodyText": "The tone of the conversation was light-hearted, almost banal. As Warren Moore, popular drivetime presenter on the commercial radio station Red Dragon FM, jokingly put his newsreader Stuart McTeer on the spot about rumours of new fuel blockades, he could not have dreamt of the storm which was about to be unleashed. By next morning queues were forming on forecourts of petrol stations in Dragon FM's south Wales constituency. By noon the panic was spreading across the country. Petrol station managers from Cornwall to Scotland were being besieged by frantic motorists. Some were rationing fuel, others were having to turn off their pumps because they were overheating. A nationwide police operation co-ordinated from Scotland Yard swung into action. The leader of the House of Commons was rushed in front of the cameras to lend a hand in the firefighting exercise. And the government's enemies were once again making political capital of the panic. Rumour The day - described by one senior police officer as \"simply mad\" - was a vivid illustration of how easily another real fuel crisis could bring the country to its knees. It also gave the psychologists an insight into the power of rumour and the rather British proclivity to panic buy. Last night Red Dragon FM, which boasts a listenership of 301,000, was doing its own firefighting exercise in trying to play down its role in the chaos. It claimed that the rumour had not started at the Cardiff-based station, though station bosses conceded they had repeated it. According to Texaco, Red Dragon rang it after the conversation was broadcast. Spokeswoman Nicole Hutchings said: \"The radio station rang us to seek clarification. There was absolutely no truth in the rumour but once it has been broadcast it is obviously very hard to quash it.\" Throughout the evening Red Dragon put out bulletins stressing that there was to be no new blockade. But it was too late: the genie was out of the bottle. Down the road at Cardiff General Service Station, manager Brian Smith had been enjoying seeing business getting back to normal after last week's trauma. He said: \"It was business as usual all day - and then all of a sudden queues started forming. It was just like last week. People were really panicking. I was serving until 1.30am when I closed and the garage up the road was still very busy then.\" Rumours reached the pubs of south Wales.

      "bodyText": "Michael Portillo's pledge today of a \"significant cut\" in petrol and diesel taxes - probably at least 5p a litre - will spark a huge party political row about spending cuts and the state of North Sea oil revenues. The Tories are certain to use figures from last year's national audit office pre-budget analysis to claim that petrol prices can be cut significantly because Gordon Brown is already getting a \"windfall tax\" following the jump in oil prices from $22 a barrel last year to $34 today. Labour will claim that to rely on oil to raise revenue will not work, because of the rapid change in prices. This, it will claim, would lead the Tories to introduce spending cuts in the NHS and other public services when the price dives. The audit office's analysis is likely to feature highly in the argument. It shows the chancellor's budget finances were based on a North Sea price of $22. By the time of the budget, the price had reached $22.8. The audit office estimates that for each one dollar rise in the oil price, the chancellor gets an extra \u00a3330m a year. With the North Sea price now $12 higher, the chancellor should be getting about \u00a34bn extra a year. That figure is disputed by the Treasury, where a spokesmen said that it would depend on the oil price staying at over $34 for the whole year. So far the price has only been that high for a month, and could easily fall back. As a result revenues have been much lower. The loss to the revenue of a 1p cut in petrol and diesel tax is estimated at \u00a3500m. Thus, in theory, the windfall gives the chancellor an opportunity to cut taxes by up to 8p a litre. John Redwood, the former shadow trade secretary, used these figures in a back of an envelope calculation, when he gave an interview to his local radio station last week, saying that petrol taxes could be cut by 5p immediately. Mr Redwood said yesterday: \"There is a windfall tax and some of it should be given back. \"The chancellor has not made any announcement of any further increased spending on schools and hospitals since the summer so this extra money was not intended for that and could be given back.\" The windfall figures have also been highlighted by Maurice Fitzpatrick, a partner in the accountancy firm Chantery Vellacott. He wrote to Tony Blair, suggesting that petrol duties should fluctuate like the oil price, stabilising the cost of petrol. The Treasury dismisses this as impracticable, saying the oil companies might not pass on all the cuts when the price went down.",

      "byline": "David Walker",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>A new book by the professor of political theory at Cambridge, John Dunn*, completed months ago turns out to have penetrating things to say about what has been fuelling recent discontents.</p> <p>His theme is the state. The past week's events showed public order is a fragile thing. Queuing at filling stations and grabbing for the last slice of supermarket loaf are signs of breakdown. Behind them lies something the modern state exists to combat - fear. It not just Tony Blair; the state lost precious authority.</p> <p>The political thinker to read has to be Thomas Hobbes. In the strife of the 17th century security was a paramount concern. To guarantee it Leviathan, the state, had to be stern. But the Diggers did not have oil depots to picket and a troop of Cromwell's dragoons would soon have dispersed them if they had. Hobbes's anxieties live on in Professor Dunn.</p> <p>Ultimately, government is about compelling people to do things they would not otherwise do - such as attending to the planet's condition by cutting use of non- renewable fuels. But government only works if someone takes on the onerous task of ruling. The politician's job - the reconciliation of conflicting interests - is intrinsically difficult and \"stealth\" may be a vital tool of the trade. We take those who do it too much for granted, blaming them for our own inconsistent expectations, criticising them for \"being out for what they can get\" when they fail to act as instruments of our sectional interests. We call it democracy yet we expect politicians to follow a true and noble vocation - in other words expect them to be aristocrats. Listen to the people is the motorists' mantra. But what if the people are wrong, short termist and out for what they can get? Nobody, not least the politicians dependent on their votes, can ever say so.</p> <p>A book about politics, says Professor Dunn, is one \"about the inevitability of disappointment\". That is because neither public nor the politicians they elect understand what they are about. \"What was John Major really doing while he was prime minister? Did he really know?\"</p> <p>The fog has, if anything, got denser. A causal factor last week was the rightwards shift in political values under Thatcher as the British state, more readily than others, adapted to the demands of free market capitalism.</p> <p>That people are selfish about fuel and disdain politics is hardly surprising. In 1987 less than half the population thought government could be trusted to serve the public interest. A decade later the scepticism had deepened. Such trends are visible in other countries. Where the UK is different is displayed in the chart. This is a much more open economy. Oil companies can do things here they couldn't elsewhere, even in the United States. The capacity of Mr Blair (or any alternate) to alter economic destiny is lessened. (The chart comes from Peter Katzenstein in Pharr and Putnam [eds] Disaffected Democracies, Princeton UP, published earlier this year.)</p> <p>The fuel protest is a complaint about one tax. On another level, it stems from uncertainty about the state's relationship with the market and public ambivalence about where the boundary between private and public interest lies. The triumph of capitalism, says Professor Dunn, exposed a paradox. Property requires political protection - laws, police officers. But there can be no political protection without (wait for it) politicians. And they, needing to get elected after all, may be tempted to confiscate property (by taxing fuel, for example) because the people want government to provide the services private enterprise will not or cannot.</p> <p>\"Over the past 25 years capital has had some success in persuading people to feel less confiscatory towards property or more devout about its standing.\" This was one of Margaret Thatcher's great achievements. \"But this success whether achieved by intimidation, mystification or rational persuasion can scarcely be relied upon.\" Poujadists may turn out to be great fans of strong government. There is a constituency out there, so the Liberal Democrats believe, for confiscating \"excess profits\" from Shell and BP. William Hague may be basking like a seal in the light of our ICM poll. But has he really got the measure of his \"fine upstanding\" citizens? They are probably no more pro- market than they are rational supporters of coherent public policy on anything.</p> <p>If socialism was the 20th century's illusion, we too live in delusion. According to Francis Fukuyama and his ilk, business's preferred model of the state (lean and low) will keep on being chosen by the consumers to provide them with protection against insecurity and fear. The latter may well grow if Saddam Hussain has anything to do with it. \"The trajectory from the Keynesian welfare state to globalised neo-liberal capital mobility may have looked a steadily rational sequence of change of belief.

      "bodyText": "A new book by the professor of political theory at Cambridge, John Dunn*, completed months ago turns out to have penetrating things to say about what has been fuelling recent discontents. His theme is the state. The past week's events showed public order is a fragile thing. Queuing at filling stations and grabbing for the last slice of supermarket loaf are signs of breakdown. Behind them lies something the modern state exists to combat - fear. It not just Tony Blair; the state lost precious authority. The political thinker to read has to be Thomas Hobbes. In the strife of the 17th century security was a paramount concern. To guarantee it Leviathan, the state, had to be stern. But the Diggers did not have oil depots to picket and a troop of Cromwell's dragoons would soon have dispersed them if they had. Hobbes's anxieties live on in Professor Dunn. Ultimately, government is about compelling people to do things they would not otherwise do - such as attending to the planet's condition by cutting use of non- renewable fuels. But government only works if someone takes on the onerous task of ruling. The politician's job - the reconciliation of conflicting interests - is intrinsically difficult and \"stealth\" may be a vital tool of the trade. We take those who do it too much for granted, blaming them for our own inconsistent expectations, criticising them for \"being out for what they can get\" when they fail to act as instruments of our sectional interests. We call it democracy yet we expect politicians to follow a true and noble vocation - in other words expect them to be aristocrats. Listen to the people is the motorists' mantra. But what if the people are wrong, short termist and out for what they can get? Nobody, not least the politicians dependent on their votes, can ever say so. A book about politics, says Professor Dunn, is one \"about the inevitability of disappointment\". That is because neither public nor the politicians they elect understand what they are about. \"What was John Major really doing while he was prime minister? Did he really know?\" The fog has, if anything, got denser. A causal factor last week was the rightwards shift in political values under Thatcher as the British state, more readily than others, adapted to the demands of free market capitalism. That people are selfish about fuel and disdain politics is hardly surprising. In 1987 less than half the population thought government could be trusted to serve the public interest. A decade later the scepticism had deepened. Such trends are visible in other countries. Where the UK is different is displayed in the chart. This is a much more open economy. Oil companies can do things here they couldn't elsewhere, even in the United States. The capacity of Mr Blair (or any alternate) to alter economic destiny is lessened. (The chart comes from Peter Katzenstein in Pharr and Putnam [eds] Disaffected Democracies, Princeton UP, published earlier this year.) The fuel protest is a complaint about one tax. On another level, it stems from uncertainty about the state's relationship with the market and public ambivalence about where the boundary between private and public interest lies. The triumph of capitalism, says Professor Dunn, exposed a paradox. Property requires political protection - laws, police officers. But there can be no political protection without (wait for it) politicians. And they, needing to get elected after all, may be tempted to confiscate property (by taxing fuel, for example) because the people want government to provide the services private enterprise will not or cannot. \"Over the past 25 years capital has had some success in persuading people to feel less confiscatory towards property or more devout about its standing.\" This was one of Margaret Thatcher's great achievements. \"But this success whether achieved by intimidation, mystification or rational persuasion can scarcely be relied upon.\" Poujadists may turn out to be great fans of strong government. There is a constituency out there, so the Liberal Democrats believe, for confiscating \"excess profits\" from Shell and BP. William Hague may be basking like a seal in the light of our ICM poll. But has he really got the measure of his \"fine upstanding\" citizens? They are probably no more pro- market than they are rational supporters of coherent public policy on anything. If socialism was the 20th century's illusion, we too live in delusion. According to Francis Fukuyama and his ilk, business's preferred model of the state (lean and low) will keep on being chosen by the consumers to provide them with protection against insecurity and fear. The latter may well grow if Saddam Hussain has anything to do with it. \"The trajectory from the Keynesian welfare state to globalised neo-liberal capital mobility may have looked a steadily rational sequence of change of belief. But no participants had a clear understanding of its implications or effects. The view that we would have an interest in learning how to control these consequences through political action is compelling. But the view that we readily could control them is deeply insensitive to the character of political institutions. \"In a capitalist world economics dominates politics. The politics which it prompts is irritable, reactive and myopic: endlessly saturated with ressentiment .\" Is there a better way of describing what has been going on in Britain during the past week or so? \u0095 The Cunning of Unreason: making sense of politics, HarperCollins \u00a319.99 david.walker@guardian.co. uk",

(How odd that Gordon Brown invited all the rightwing editors to his wedding party, fresh from another day's work cutting off his legs.) The people are also frivolous: they get bored because tolerably good government is dull. They demand occasional adventures and earthquakes to feel alive - tears for Princess Diana, outrageous pickets - anything will do. The servants of the people must not whisper nor even think these things: in a democracy the customer is always right. But what now?</p> <p>\"Don't panic!\" the government is running around telling itself. Let's face it, they reason, the government almost failed its prime purpose - to keep order - only a day away from mortal meltdown. The Don't Panickers reassure themselves that the people are right to chastise governments that take them to a perilous brink with IMF, a three-day week or ERM crises. Even now, as panic buying of petrol returns... It is polite and apologetic of the government to murmur this mea culpa, but on this occasion the people willed it themselves, egging on the 2000 farmers and hauliers as tribunes of the oppressed masses. The people are to blame, fair and square. But so what?</p> <p>Something has to be done. How can the government explain present policy better to people who don't hear it, too busy bellowing that the government doesn't listen to them? None of this petrol tax revolt makes any sense. The total cost of motoring (petrol, excise duty, insurance) has risen by 82% since 1987, but average earnings rose by 110%: that means the relative price of motoring has fallen steadily since then. Consider this: by March petrol prices had risen so steeply, the chancellor went out of his way to appease the angry motorist in the budget. Too far, many environmentalists said at the time. He removed the long-standing fuel escalator, cut vehicle excise duty for many and spent wildly on road building. It worked. The AA arch grumblers' press release was positively jubilant: \"This is the first time that drivers can take some heart from a budget in over seven years\". Does the Daily Telegraph remember its own leader at the time? Now leading the raucous bring-down-this-illegitimate-government-because-it's-not-Tory brigade, it wrote that the budget was \"the most motorist friendly in eight years\". What has happened since then? Nothing. Petrol prices have barely risen since March. The timing of all this is odd.</p> <p>The Tories are promising petrol tax will top its list for price cuts: John Redwood called for a 5p fuel tax cut. But each 2p off petrol tax only saves the average motorist a pathetic 50p a week. So that 5p cut would only save most people \u00a31.25 a week. Would that really make such a difference? It would to the Treasury, who would lose \u00a32.5bn. What would Mr Redwood cut for that sum? It could be \u00a35 off the pension or \u00a35 off child benefit.</p> <p>So is the answer to sit tight, explain the government's excellent case better and just say No Passeran to the truckers? Maybe sheer force of argument will swing the polls back, but what if it doesn't by the November budget? The greater good is not served by losing the election, so a third way might look like the better part of valour. Not caving in, just a little softening of the line might be wise. There are ideas now floated in Jack Straw's crisis task force which go beyond how to force oil companies to keep trucking.</p> <p>One idea concerns at least a measure of stabilisation in petrol prices. The price of oil fluctuates wildly with world prices and the people don't like it: such is human nature that they only notice when it goes up, not when it comes down. What about stabilising petrol prices at a fixed ceiling and letting the Treasury take at least some of the strain when prices rise or take profits as oil prices fall? Congestion charges - legislation now going through - will eventually have a good levelling effect as the rural poor who are hardest hit by petrol prices would pay nothing. But oil prices are effectively a de facto monopoly commodity which most people cannot (in the short term) avoid using, such as gas, electricity and water. People don't give up their cars as prices rise because they can't and because public transport costs even more. So oil too should have a regulator to fix the price fairly between oil companies and Treasury, according to whatever formula each budget decrees. As it happens, the Financial Times is predicting oil prices will plummet by this time next year, in which case the Treasury would cash in. The Treasury wouldn't like it as it builds in uncertainty as revenues fluctuate with oil prices: petrol tax accounts for 6% of total revenues. But then the sums never work out precisely as the Treasury predicts each year. The Treasury hates hypothecation which ties its hands and threatens finances in bad years - but transparency in tax is going to be important in the coming great tax show-down at the election. Fuel tax windfalls should all be promised for buses and trains.</p> <p>The Treasury and its very clever thinkers hate to bend to the idiocy of the voters but in an emergency they may have to - a bit. They protest vigorously at even a hint of a fuel tax cut when sensible people want more spent on teachers, nurses, buses and pensions. But they protest too much. It's not as if everything Gordon Brown has done has been pure unalloyed prudence and fairness. Far from it. Income tax not stealth direct tax would have been prudent and fair. It's an irony that his middle- England pleasing policy is the one that has come back to haunt him. The Institute for Fiscal Studies shows that although Labour's taxes and benefits give 9% more to the poorest 10th while the richest 10th lost 0.5%, that isn't the whole story: 26% of the poorest 10th are worse off, (those without children) because taxes are piled on to petrol, tobacco and alcohol and not on to income tax which they don't pay. Direct taxes hit them hard - and moralising about their unhealthy habits is no excuse for this hard fact while the incomes of the richest are affected least.</p> <p>Other questions: where were the telescopes of this focus-group obsessed government when the petrol tax asteroid zapped in from outer space? There were hints but everyone missed them, Tories included. Focus groups didn't help the government's wish to both listen and lead. At the election the democratic process will revive as Tory tax-cutting is pitted in mortal combat against Labour spending - a clean choice, a crisp argument, real substance. Time Labour abandoned the big tent - or big wedding party - marking the line between itself and the enemy to give people a genuine battle to join.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "At its worst for Tony Blair the four-point Tory lead on this months Guardian/ICM poll could translate if there were a general election tomorrow into a minority Conservative government kept in power by the Ulster Unionists. Such a scenario will alarm and depress Labour voters almost as much as the sudden and unexpected loss of the partys eight year unbroken opinion poll lead. The ICM survey, which followed two other polls showing the two parties neck and neck (NOP) or the Tories ahead by two points (Mori), does indicate that the government is in significant trouble from which it may not quickly recover. Although Tory strategists were cheering the news as the petrol crisis provided both them and the Liberal Democrats with some much needed political momentum, detailed analysis shows there may be a crumb of comfort for Labour. In the early summer after William Hague's big campaigns on asylum and law and order the Tories managed to push their opinion poll rating up from 30% to 35%. But then the Tory party seemed to disappear from the news agenda as most of the shadow cabinet took a holiday. Now the petrol crisis has given them an added push to hit 38% not astronomic for an opposition party at this stage in the parliament but the best that Mr Hague has managed since he became leader. The one crumb of comfort for Tony Blair is that, as with the two weekend polls, it has been the Liberal Democrats the traditional home of the protest vote and not the Tories who have benefited most from Labours 10 point slide from 44% last month to 34% this month. However the psephologist Professor John Curtice, of Strathclyde University, points out that the Tories may be in a stronger position than the opinion polls suggest because in the seats that count they are outperforming the national swing. Recent local election results show they are doing better than the national polls indicate in those key seats they need to recapture from Labour at the next election. One reason for this is the decline in anti-Tory tactical voting by Liberal Democrat supporters as their disenchantment with the Labour government grows. A general election result tomorrow with the Tories on 38%, Labour on 34% and the Liberal Democrats on 22%, as indicated by this weeks Guardian/ICM poll, would be unlikely to keep a minority Labour government in power with Lib Dem support. Prof Curtice says. He says that the difference in the expected better performance by the Tories in terms of seats rather than a uniform opinion poll swing means that Labour would need to be three points ahead of the Conservatives to be sure of forming a majority government. The real question is whether these three polls at the end of the petrol crisis are a temporary blip for Mr Blair or represent a decisive shift in support based on a sudden loss of confidence which New Labour will find hard to reverse. So far voters have made clear they want to punish Tony Blair particularly for the petrol crisis and more generally for not being a listening government, but have not gone as far as endorsing the Conservatives as the credible alternative government. The party conference season will determine whether it will take a long or short haul for Labour to stage a recovery.",

The straits, which separate Fidel Castro's regime from the US, have been the backdrop for many recent dramas. The 90-mile stretch of water is the barrier Cubans have to cross to seek asylum in the US, and it is where the five-year-old boy Elian Gonzalez was found floating on a car's inner tube after the boat carrying him, his mother and a dozen other would-be migrants sank in the shark-infested seas. His discovery set in motion a seven-month tug-of-war over the boy's fate which ended with his return to Cuba in June. Four years ago, US-Cuban relations hit a new low after the Cuban air force shot down two small planes piloted by an exile group called Brothers to the Rescue, which patrols the Florida Straits with the aim of giving assistance to Cubans trying to escape from the perceived poverty and political restrictions of their homeland. Adding to the confusion yesterday, the organisation's leader, Jose Basulto, announced that he intended to join the search-and-rescue effort.
